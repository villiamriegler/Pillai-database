CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is 
adequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), 
taken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component 
formulation. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Dafiro HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. 
Before switching to Dafiro HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the monocomponents 
taken at the same time. The dose of Dafiro HCT should be based on the doses of the individual 
components of the combination at the time of switching. 
The maximum recommended dose of Dafiro HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Dafiro HCT is contraindicated for use in patients with 
anuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
<30 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Due to the valsartan component, Dafiro HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without 
cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Dafiro HCT is not 
suitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). Amlodipine dose recommendations 
have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. When switching 
eligible hypertensive patients (see section 4.1) with hepatic impairment to Dafiro HCT, the lowest 
available dose of the amlodipine component should be used. 
Heart failure and coronary artery disease 
There is limited experience with the use of Dafiro HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in patients 
with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and 
coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Dafiro HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg.

Elderly (age 65 years or over) 
Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, 
particularly at the maximum dose of Dafiro HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this 
patient population are limited. When switching eligible elderly hypertensive patients (see section 4.1) 
to Dafiro HCT, the lowest available dose of the amlodipine component should be used. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Dafiro HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for 
the indication of essential hypertension. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Dafiro HCT can be taken with or without food. 
The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water, at the same time of the day and preferably in 
the morning. 
4.3  Contraindications 
−

− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine 
derivatives, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. 
Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis. 
Concomitant use of Dafiro HCT with aliskiren-containing products in patients with diabetes 
mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. 
Severe hypotension. 
Shock (including cardiogenic shock). 
Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. hypertrophic obstructive 
cardiomyopathy and high grade aortic stenosis). 
Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. 
Sodium- and/or volume-depleted patients 
Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with 
the maximum dose of Dafiro HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of 
valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) 
patients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in 
patients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. 
In sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, 
symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Dafiro HCT. Dafiro HCT should 
be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. 
If excessive hypotension occurs with Dafiro HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position 
and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once 
blood pressure has been stabilised.

Serum electrolyte changes 
Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
In the controlled trial of Dafiro HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and 
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. 
In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum 
electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. 
Periodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at 
appropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk 
factors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior 
electrolyte imbalances. 
Valsartan 
Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing 
potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not 
recommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate. 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Treatment with Dafiro HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting 
hypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-
existing hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with 
conditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal 
(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide 
therapy, Dafiro HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. 
Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or 
exacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms 
(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide 
should only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid 
hyponatraemia develops during Dafiro HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until 
normalisation of natraemia. 
All patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in 
electrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. 
Renal impairment 
Thiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Dafiro 
HCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including 
potassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Dafiro HCT is contraindicated in 
patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). 
No dose adjustment of Dafiro HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment 
(GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m2). 
Renal artery stenosis 
Dafiro HCT should be used with caution to treat hypertension in patients with unilateral or bilateral 
renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney since blood urea and serum creatinine may 
increase in such patients. 
Kidney transplantation 
To date there is no experience of the safe use of Dafiro HCT in patients who have had a recent kidney 
transplantation. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Valsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile. The half-life of amlodipine is prolonged and 
AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver function; dose recommendations have not been 
established. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum 
recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Dafiro HCT is not suitable in this group of 
patients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). 
Angioedema 
Angioedema, including swelling of the larynx and glottis, causing airway obstruction and/or swelling 
of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue, has been reported in patients treated with valsartan. Some of 
these patients previously experienced angioedema with other medicinal products including ACE 
inhibitors. Dafiro HCT should be discontinued immediately in patients who develop angioedema and 
should not be re-administered. 
Heart failure and coronary artery disease/post-myocardial infarction 
As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal 
function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose 
renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with 
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or 
progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been 
reported with valsartan. Evaluation of patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction should 
always include assessment of renal function. 
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New 
York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine 
was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the 
incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo. 
Calcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with 
congestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. 
Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the 
maximum dose of Dafiro HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient populations 
is limited. 
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis 
As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with mitral stenosis or significant 
aortic stenosis that is not high grade. 
Pregnancy 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless 
continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to 
alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. 
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if 
appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Primary hyperaldosteronism 
Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist 
valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Dafiro HCT is not 
recommended in this population. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Systemic lupus erythematosus 
Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate 
systemic lupus erythematosus. 
Other metabolic disturbances 
Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels 
of cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral 
hypoglycaemic agents may be required. 
Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Dafiro HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic 
hyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of 
uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible 
patients. 
Thiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum 
calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Dafiro HCT is contraindicated in 
patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing 
hypercalcaemia. Dafiro HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. 
Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked 
hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued 
before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 
Photosensitivity 
Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If 
photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Dafiro HCT, it is recommended to stop the 
treatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect 
exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. 
Choroidal effusion, acute myopia and secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma 
Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in 
choroidal effusion with visual field defect, acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. 
Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within 
hours to a week of treatment initiation. Untreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent 
vision loss. 
The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or 
surgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk 
factors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or 
penicillin allergy. 
General 
Caution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients with 
allergy and asthma.

Elderly (age 65 years or over) 
Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, 
particularly at the maximum dose of Dafiro HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this 
patient population are limited. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren increases the risk of 
hypotension, hyperkalaemia, and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual 
blockage of RAAS through the combined use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is therefore not 
recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist 
supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. 
ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer 
An increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous 
cell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide exposure has been 
observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. 
Photosensitising actions of hydrochlorothiazide could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. 
Patients taking hydrochlorothiazide should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly 
check their skin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible 
preventive measures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, 
adequate protection should be advised to the patients in order to minimise the risk of skin cancer. 
Suspicious skin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations 
of biopsies. The use of hydrochlorothiazide may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have 
experienced previous NMSC (see also section 4.8). 
Acute respiratory toxicity 
Very rare severe cases of acute respiratory toxicity, including acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS), have been reported after taking hydrochlorothiazide. Pulmonary oedema typically develops 
within minutes to hours after hydrochlorothiazide intake. At the onset, symptoms include dyspnoea, 
fever, pulmonary deterioration and hypotension. If diagnosis of ARDS is suspected, Dafiro HCT 
should be withdrawn, and appropriate treatment given. Hydrochlorothiazide should not be 
administered to patients who previously experienced ARDS following hydrochlorothiazide intake.

Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed with Dafiro HCT. 
Thus, only information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual 
active substances is provided in this section. 
However, it is important to take into account that Dafiro HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of 
other antihypertensive agents.

juice 
Effect of the interaction with other medicinal products 
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and 
toxicity have been reported during concomitant 
administration of lithium with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin 
II receptor antagonists including valsartan or thiazides. 
Since renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, 
the risk of lithium toxicity may presumably be increased 
further with Dafiro HCT. Therefore careful monitoring of 
serum lithium concentrations is recommended during 
concomitant use. 
If a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is 
considered necessary in combination with valsartan, 
frequent monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised. 
Administration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit 
juice is not recommended as bioavailability may be 
increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood 
pressure lowering effects.

[e.g. carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, 
fosphenytoin, 
primidone], rifampicin,

selective 
cyclooxygenase-2 
inhibitors (COX-2 
inhibitors), 
acetylsalicylic acid 
(>3 g/day), and non-
selective NSAIDs 
Inhibitors of the uptake 
transporter (rifampicin, 
ciclosporin) or efflux 
transporter (ritonavir) 
Effect of the interaction with other medicinal products 
Concomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, 
macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil 
or diltiazem) may give rise to significant increase in 
amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these 
pharmacokinetic variations may be more pronounced in 
the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may 
thus be required. 
Upon co-administration of known inducers of the 
CYP3A4, the plasma concentration of amlodipine may 
vary. Therefore, blood pressure should be monitored and 
dose regulation considered both during and after 
concomitant medication particularly with strong CYP3A4 
inducers (e.g. rifampicin, hypericum perforatum). 
Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine 
with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in 
exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It 
is recommended to limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg 
daily in patients on amlodipine. 
In animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and 
cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with 
hyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and 
intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalaemia, it is 
recommended that the co-administration of calcium 
channel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided in 
patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the 
management of malignant hyperthermia. 
NSAIDS can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of both 
angiotensin II antagonists and hydrochlorothiazide when 
administered simultaneously. Furthermore, concomitant 
use of Dafiro HCT and NSAIDs may lead to worsening of 
renal function and an increase in serum potassium. 
Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of 
the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate 
hydration of the patient. 
The results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue 
indicate that valsartan is a substrate of the hepatic uptake 
transporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux transporter 
MRP2. Co-administration of inhibitors of the uptake 
transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter 
(ritonavir) may increase the systemic exposure to 
valsartan.

Medicinal products

Concomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with 
substances that also have a blood pressure lowering effect 
(e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system 
activity or direct vasodilatation) may potentiate orthostatic 
hypotension. 
Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase 
the risk of adverse reactions caused by amantadine. 
The bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be 
increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, 
biperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal 
motility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, it is 
anticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride 
may decrease the bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. 
Thiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of 
the antidiabetic medicinal product may be necessary. 
Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk 
of lactic acidosis induced by possible functional renal 
failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. 
Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including 
hydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase the 
risk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including 
hydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the hyperglycaemic 
effect of diazoxide. 
Concomitant treatment with ciclosporin may increase the 
risk of hyperuricaemia and gout-type complications. 
Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the 
renal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. 
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their 
myelosuppressive effects. 
Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may 
occur as undesirable effects, favouring the onset of 
digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. 
In case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an 
increased risk of acute renal failure, especially with high 
doses of iodine products. Patients should be re-hydrated 
before the administration. 
Absorption of thiazide diuretics, including 
hydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or 
colestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of 
thiazide diuretics. However, staggering the dosage of 
hydrochlorothiazide and resin such that 
hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before 
or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would 
potentially minimise the interaction. 
The hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide may be 
increased by concomitant administration of kaliuretic 
diuretics, corticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, 
penicillin G and salicylic acid derivatives or 
antiarrhythmics. If these medicinal products are to be 
prescribed with the amlodipine /valsartan 
/hydrochlorothiazide combination, monitoring of 
potassium plasma levels is advised.

The hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified 
by concomitant administration of medicinal products such 
as antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. 
Caution is indicated in long-term administration of these 
medicinal products. 
Due to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide 
should be administered with caution when associated with 
medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, 
in particular Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics and 
some antipsychotics. 
Dose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be 
necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of 
serum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or 
sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. 
Co-administration of thiazide diuretics, including 
hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of 
hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. 
There have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia 
occurring with concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide 
and methyldopa. 
Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the 
action of curare derivatives. 
Thiazides potentiate the antihypertensive action of other 
antihypertensive drugs (e.g. guanethidine, methyldopa, 
beta-blockers, vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, 
ACE inhibitors, ARBs and Direct Renin Inhibitors 
[DRIs]). 
Hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor 
amines such as noradrenaline. The clinical significance of 
this effect is uncertain and not sufficient to preclude their 
use. 
Administration of thiazide diuretics, including 
hydrochlorothiazide, with vitamin D or with calcium salts 
may potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use 
of thiazide type diuretics may lead to hypercalcaemia in 
patients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. 
hyperparathyroidism, malignancy or vitamin-D-mediated 
conditions) by increasing tubular calcium reabsorption. 
Dual blockade of the RAAS with ARBs, ACE inhibitors or aliskiren 
Clinical trial data have shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACE 
inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as 
hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to 
the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Amlodipine 
The safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, 
reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only 
recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the 
mother and foetus. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Valsartan 
The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first 
trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and 
third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors 
during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk 
cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II 
Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued 
AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative 
antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When 
pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, 
alternative therapy should be started. 
Exposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human 
foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal 
toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). 
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check 
of renal function and skull is recommended. 
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
There is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first 
trimester. Animal studies are insufficient. 
Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of 
hydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental 
perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and 
thrombocytopenia. 
Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
There is no experience on the use of Dafiro HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data with 
the components, the use of Dafiro HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contra-indicated 
during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. The proportion of the maternal dose received by the infant has 
been estimated with an interquartile range of 3-7%, with a maximum of 15%. The effect of amlodipine 
on infants is unknown. No information is available regarding the use of valsartan during breast-
feeding. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses 
causing intense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Dafiro HCT during breast-feeding is 
not recommended. If Dafiro HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as 
possible. Alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are 
preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
There are no clinical studies on fertility with Dafiro HCT. 
Valsartan 
Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses 
up to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis 
(calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). 
Amlodipine 
Reversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients 
treated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of 
amlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Patients taking Dafiro HCT and driving vehicles or using machines should take into account that 
dizziness or weariness may occasionally occur. 
Amlodipine can have mild or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients 
taking Dafiro HCT suffer from dizziness, headache, fatigue or nausea the ability to react may be 
impaired. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
The safety profile of Dafiro HCT presented below is based on clinical studies performed with Dafiro 
HCT and the known safety profile of the individual components amlodipine, valsartan and 
hydrochlorothiazide. 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Dafiro HCT has been evaluated at its maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg in one 
controlled short-term (8 weeks) clinical study with 2,271 patients, 582 of whom received valsartan in 
combination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Adverse reactions were generally mild and 
transient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled 
clinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Dafiro HCT were dizziness 
and hypotension (0.7%). 
In the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were 
observed with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual 
therapy components. 
In the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the 
combination of Dafiro HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of action 
of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the 
hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide.

* 
**  Mostly consistent with cholestasis 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Non-melanoma skin cancer: based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative 
dose-dependent association between hydrochlorothiazide and NMSC has been observed (see also 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
There is no experience of overdose with Dafiro HCT. The major symptom of overdose with valsartan 
is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive 
peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic 
hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema has rarely been reported as a consequence of amlodipine 
overdose that may manifest with a delayed onset (24-48 hours post-ingestion) and require ventilatory 
support. Early resuscitative measures (including fluid overload) to maintain perfusion and cardiac 
output may be precipitating factors. 
Treatment 
Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide 
Clinically significant hypotension due to Dafiro HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, 
including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and 
attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring 
vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous 
calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. 
Amlodipine 
If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of 
activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine 
has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. 
Amlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. 
Valsartan 
Valsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, 
hypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and 
symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or 
accentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain 
anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. 
The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II antagonists, 
other combinations, ATC code: C09DX01. 
Mechanism of action 
Dafiro HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control 
blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist 
class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and hydrochlorothiazide belongs 
to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these substances has an additive 
antihypertensive effect. 
Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Dafiro HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total of 
2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure 
was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan 
10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were 
assigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by 
week 2. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with Dafiro 
HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with 
amlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple 
combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in 
reduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure 
with Dafiro HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 6.2/3.3 mmHg 
greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with 
amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after 
being on their maximal dose of Dafiro HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved 
blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) with Dafiro HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual 
combination therapies (45-54%) (p<0.0001). 
In a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and 
statistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with 
the triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and 
hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine. 
Amlodipine 
Mechanism of action 
The amlodipine component of Dafiro HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into 
cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is 
due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular 
resistance and in blood pressure. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine 
binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent 
upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. 
Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces 
vasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood 
pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with 
chronic dosing. 
Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. 
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a 
decrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal 
plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. 
As with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and 
during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have 
generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on 
left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been 
associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact 
animals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. 
Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals 
or humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta 
blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic 
parameters were observed. 
Amlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and 
angiographically documented coronary artery disease.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Use in patients with hypertension 
A randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering 
treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer therapies: 
amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-inhibitor) as 
first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild to moderate 
hypertension. 
A total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of 
4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: 
previous myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density 
lipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed 
by electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). 
The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial 
infarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based 
therapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among 
secondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined 
cardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the 
chlorthalidone group (10.2% versus 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was 
no significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-
based therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. 
Valsartan 
Mechanism of action 
Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively 
on the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Administration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without 
affecting pulse rate. 
In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs 
within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The antihypertensive 
effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the maximum 
reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Mechanism of action 
The site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been 
shown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the 
thiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of 
action of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl- site, 
thereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride 
excretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma 
volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary 
potassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium.

Non-melanoma skin cancer 
Based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between 
hydrochlorothiazide and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 
71,533 cases of BCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population 
controls, respectively. High hydrochlorothiazide use (≥50000 mg cumulative) was associated with an 
adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. 
A clear cumulative dose response relationship was observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study 
showed a possible association between lip cancer (SCC) and exposure to hydrochlorothiazide: 
633 cases of lip cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, using a risk-set sampling 
strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an adjusted OR 2.1 (95% 
CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25000 mg) and OR 7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the 
highest cumulative dose (~100000 mg) (see also section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Dafiro HCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
Other: dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET [ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in 
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial] and VA NEPHRON-D [The Veterans Affairs 
Nephropathy in Diabetes]) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an 
ARB. 
ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-
D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. 
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and 
mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as 
compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these 
results are also relevant for other ACE inhibitors and ARBs. 
ACE inhibitors and ARBs should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic 
nephropathy (see section 4.4). 
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) 
was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE inhibitor 
or an ARB in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular 
disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. 
Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in 
the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, 
hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the 
placebo group.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Linearity 
Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. 
Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
Following oral administration of Dafiro HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations of 
amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, 
respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from 
Dafiro HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms. 
Amlodipine 
Absorption 
After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of 
amlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 
80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. 
Distribution 
Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that 
approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation 
Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites. 
Elimination 
Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 
30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. Ten 
per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. 
Valsartan 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached 
in 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to 
valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h 
post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups. This reduction in 
AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and 
valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. 
Distribution 
The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, 
indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly bound to 
serum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. 
Biotransformation 
Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is recovered as metabolites. A 
hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan 
AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. 
Elimination 
Valsartan shows multiexponential decay kinetics (t½α <1 h and t½ß about 9 h). Valsartan is primarily 
eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug. 
Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h and its renal 
clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Absorption 
The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 hours). The increase in 
mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. 
The effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute 
bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum 
proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at 
approximately 3 times the level in plasma. 
Biotransformation 
Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. 
Elimination 
Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal 
elimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and 
accumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed dose is being 
excreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration 
and active secretion into the renal tubule. 
Special populations 
Paediatric patients (age below 18 years) 
No pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. 
Elderly (age 65 years or over) 
Time to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly 
patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) 
and elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the 
young, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage. 
Systemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this 
has not been shown to have any clinical significance. 
Limited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and 
hypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. 
Since the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose 
regimens are recommended (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As expected 
for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation 
was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. 
Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide 
are increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe 
renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Dafiro HCT is contraindicated in 
patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Very limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic 
impairment. Patients with hepatic impairment have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting 
increase of approximately 40–60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic 
liver disease, exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy 
volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Dafiro HCT is 
contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide 
In a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, 
valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and 
amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Dafiro HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target 
organ toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Dafiro HCT for clinical use in humans. 
Preclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with 
amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of 
red blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum 
urea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in 
the kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after 
a 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects. 
The amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or 
carcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have 
been on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have 
been tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results. 
Amlodipine 
Reproductive toxicology 
Reproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of 
labour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum 
recommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. 
Impairment of fertility 
There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females 
14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human 
dose of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine 
besilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma 
follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in 
the number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. 
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis 
Rats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide 
daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The 
highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 
10 mg on a mg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. 
Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. 
* Based on patient weight of 50 kg 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Valsartan 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development. 
In rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to 
lower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) 
in the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the 
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 
320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). 
In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a 
reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of 
changes in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised blood urea nitrogen, and renal tubular hyperplasia 
and basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 
18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose 
of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). 
In marmosets at comparable doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the 
kidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy including raised blood urea nitrogen and 
creatinine. 
Hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were 
considered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged 
hypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy 
of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Dafiro HCT is and what it is used for 
Dafiro HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. All 
of these substances help to control high blood pressure. 
− 
Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine 
stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from 
tightening. 
Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. 
Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the 
blood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. 
Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called “thiazide diuretics”. 
Hydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. 
As a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. 
− 
− 
Dafiro HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients whose blood pressure is already 
controlled while taking amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from 
taking one tablet containing all three substances. 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Dafiro HCT 
Do not take Dafiro HCT 
− 
if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also recommended to avoid Dafiro HCT in early 
pregnancy – see Pregnancy section.) 
if you are allergic to amlodipine or to any other calcium channel blockers, valsartan, 
hydrochlorothiazide, sulphonamide-derived medicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary 
infections), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, do not take Dafiro HCT and talk to your doctor. 
if you have liver disease, destruction of the small bile ducts within the liver (biliary cirrhosis) 
leading to the build up of bile in the liver (cholestasis). 
if you have severe kidney problems or if you are having dialysis. 
if you are unable to produce urine (anuria). 
if the level of potassium or sodium in your blood is too low despite treatment to increase the 
potassium or sodium levels in your blood. 
if the level of calcium in your blood is too high despite treatment to reduce the calcium levels in 
your blood. 
if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). 
if you have severe low blood pressure (hypotension). 
if you have narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition 
where your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). 
if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack. 
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren. 
If any of the above applies to you, do not take Dafiro HCT and talk to your doctor. 
Warnings and precautions

prescribed the maximum dose of Dafiro HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg). 
if you have experienced a heart attack. Follow your doctor’s instructions for the starting dose 
carefully. Your doctor may also check your kidney function. 
if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “aortic 
or mitral stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called 
“obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”). 
if you suffer from aldosteronism. This is a disease in which the adrenal glands make too much 
of the hormone aldosterone If this applies to you, the use of Dafiro HCT is not recommended. 
if you suffer from a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or 
“SLE”). 
if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). 
if you have high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. 
if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure.

if you have experienced swelling, particularly of the face and throat, while taking other 
medicines (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). If you get these symptoms, 
stop taking Dafiro HCT and contact your doctor straight away. You should never take Dafiro 
HCT again. 
if you experience dizziness and/or fainting during treatment with Dafiro HCT, tell your doctor 
as soon as possible. 
if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of fluid 
accumulation in the vascular layer of the eye (choroidal effusion) or an increase of pressure in 
your eye and can happen within hours to a week of taking Dafiro HCT. This can lead to 
permanent vision impairment, if not treated. 
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: 
− 
an ACE inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems. 
aliskiren. 
− 
if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. 
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase 
the risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin 
from sun exposure and UV rays while taking Dafiro HCT. 
if you experienced breathing or lung problems (including inflammation or fluid in the lungs) 
following hydrochlorothiazide intake in the past. If you develop any severe shortness of breath 
or difficulty breathing after taking Dafiro HCT, seek medical attention immediately. 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. 
See also information under the heading “Do not take Dafiro HCT”. 
If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Dafiro HCT in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended. 
Elderly people (age 65 years and older) 
Dafiro HCT can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults and in 
the same way as they have already taken the three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and 
hydrochlorothiazide. Elderly patients, particularly those taking the maximum dose of Dafiro HCT 
(10 mg/320 mg/25 mg), should have their blood pressure checked regularly.

Dafiro HCT with food, drink and alcohol 
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be consumed by people who are prescribed Dafiro HCT. 
This is because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active 
substance amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering effect 
of Dafiro HCT. Talk to your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol may make your blood pressure 
fall too much and/or increase the possibility of dizziness or fainting. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will 
normally advise you to stop taking Dafiro HCT before you become pregnant or as soon as you know 
you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Dafiro HCT. Dafiro HCT is 
not recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.

Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Amlodipine has been 
shown to pass into breast milk in small amounts. Dafiro HCT is not recommended for mothers who 
are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, 
especially if your baby is a newborn, or was born prematurely. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine may make you feel dizzy, drowsy, nauseous or have a headache. If you experience 
these symptoms, do not drive or use tools or machines. 
3. 
How to take Dafiro HCT 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. This will help you get the best results and lower the risk of side effects. 
The usual dose of Dafiro HCT is one tablet per day. 
− 
− 
− 
It is best to take the tablet at the same time each day. Morning is the best time. 
Swallow the tablet whole with a glass of water. 
You can take Dafiro HCT with or without food. Do not take Dafiro HCT with grapefruit or 
grapefruit juice. 
Depending on how you respond to the treatment, your doctor may suggest a higher or lower dose. 
Do not exceed the prescribed dose. 
If you take more Dafiro HCT than you should 
If you have accidentally taken too many Dafiro HCT tablets, talk to a doctor immediately.You may 
require medical attention. Excess fluid may accumulate in your lungs (pulmonary oedema) causing 
shortness of breath that may develop up to 24-48 hours after intake. 
If you forget to take Dafiro HCT 
If you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember and then take the next 
dose at its usual time. If it is almost time for your next dose you should simply take the next tablet at 
the usual time. Do not take a double dose (two tablets at once) to make up for a forgotten tablet. 
If you stop taking Dafiro HCT 
Stopping your treatment with Dafiro HCT may cause your disease to get worse. Do not stop taking 
your medicine unless your doctor tells you to. 
Always take this medicine, even if you are feeling well 
People who have high blood pressure often do not notice any signs of the problem. Many feel normal. 
It is very important that you take this medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to get the best results 
and reduce the risk of side effects. Keep your appointments with the doctor even if you are feeling 
well. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

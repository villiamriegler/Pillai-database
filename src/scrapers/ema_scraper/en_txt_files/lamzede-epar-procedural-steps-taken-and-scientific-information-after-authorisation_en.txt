a 24-month open-label phase II trial investigating the 
immunogenicity, update the summary of the safety

safety and efficacy of repeated velmanase alfa treatment in 
profile, add cyanosis to the list of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) with frequency 'common', add the 
information that the safety profile observed in 
children under age 6 is consistent with what was 
observed in previous studies, update the 
pharmacodynamic properties. These proposed SmPC 
updates are based on the final results of rhLAMAN-08 
study, which is listed as an Annex II study in the 
RMP, and is a 24-month multi-centre, open-label 
phase II trial investigating the safety and efficacy of 
repeated velmanase alfa (recombinant human alpha-
mannosidase) treatment in paediatric patients <6 
years if age with alpha-mannosidosis, The Package 
Leaflet is being update accordingly. The RMPv8.1 has 
also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to bring the PI in line with QRD template 
v10.1 and v10.2. 
paediatric patients below 6 years of age with alpha-
mannosidosis, SmPC sections 4.4, 4,8 and 5.1 are being 
updated to amend an existing warning on immunogenicity, 
update the summary of the safety profile and add cyanosis 
as an ADR with frequency 'common', and update the 
pharmacodynamic properties in children below 6 years of 
age.

Kidney cancer is diagnosed in 340 000 individuals worldwide (North America 64 000, Europe 115 000) 
each year and results in 140 000 deaths annually (North America 17 000, Europe 50 000)1. The 
incidence has generally increased in recent years2. Renal cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 
90% of kidney cancer cases. Approximately 75% of RCCs are clear cell tumors (Lopez-Beltran et al 
2006).

Many patients present with advanced or unresectable disease at initial diagnosis, and up to 30% of 
patients eventually relapse following surgical management of initially localized disease3. The median 
overall survival for patients with advanced RCC ranges from about 8 months (poor risk score) to 4 
years (favourable risk score). The extent and location of tumour metastases in patients with advanced 
RCC contribute to significant morbidity. Metastatic symptoms include airway obstruction, venous 
thromboembolism, bone pain, skeletal related events (SREs), and hypercalcemia. In addition, 
paraneoplastic syndromes (hypertension and disorders of the endocrine, hepatic, and neuromuscular 
system impact quality of life of patients with advanced RCC4. Prognostic factors for survival in patients 
with advanced RCC have been described including the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
(MSKCC) criteria5 on the basis of clinical pretreatment characteristics. Factors associated with a 
shorter survival were low Karnofsky performance status (KPS), low hemoglobin level, and high 
corrected serum calcium. A subsequent IMDC model developed for advanced RCC patients6, 7 and was 
validated and has become well-established. It includes the following three additional risk factors: time 
from initial diagnosis to initiation of therapy of < 1 year, high absolute neutrophil count, and high 
platelet count. 
Information on prognosis from the ESMO guidelines (see table below) shows that poor risk patients 
have a considerably shorter life expectancy than intermediate risk patients:

Median overall survival estimates in first- and second-line according to the 
IMDC risk groups 
Renal cell carcinoma is usually resistant to chemotherapy and current therapies in treatment-naïve 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC are anti-angiogenic drugs that target VEGF (ie, 
bevacizumab) and VEGFRs (ie, sunitinib, pazopanib), temsirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) inhibitor, which is usually reserved for RCC patients with poor-risk disease8. The median PFS 
ranges from 8 to 11 months for treatment-naïve patients receiving sunitinib or pazopanib9, 10, 11, 12. In

the above registrational studies for sunitinib and pazopanib, treatment-naïve patients of any risk 
category (favorable-, intermediate-, and poor-risk) were enrolled. A retrospective analysis of the 
registrational Phase 3 trial of sunitinib vs IFN-α trial in treatment-naïve subjects13 showed differences 
in median PFS in the sunitinib arm by IMDC risk category (favourable 16.0 months; intermediate 10.7 
months; poor 2.5 months). The registrational study Phase 3 trial of temsirolimus included only 
treatment-naïve patients with intermediate- or poor-risk disease per MSKCC criteria. In the 
temsirolimus arm the median PFS was 5.5 months and the median OS was 10.9 months14. 
ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of renal cell carcinoma (2016) 
presents an algorithm for systemic treatment in mRCC with a clear cell component (Figure 1). 
According to the algorithm, sunitinib is the recommended first-line treatment of clear cell RCC for 
patients with good or intermediate risk, while temsirolimus is the first choice in patients with poor risk, 
however, with sunitinib as a “reasonable alternative”.

Despite advances in the treatment of RCC over the past decade, the vast majority of patients acquire 
resistance to targeted therapy as evidenced by disease progression. In addition, approximately 25% of 
treatment-naïve patients are a priori resistant to VEGF-targeted therapy and derive no clinical 
benefit15. Therefore, an unmet need remains for treatments that will prolong time to progression and 
improve survival. 
Cabozantinib is a multi-targeted small inhibitor tyrosine kinases. Cabozantinib has shown inhibition 
against several RTKs known to influence tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis, including MET, 
VEGFR2, and AXL. The initial marketing authorisation for cabozantinib (Cabometyx) was based on a 
phase 3 trial (METEOR) of cabozantinib vs everolimus in patients with advanced RCC after prior anti-
angiogenic therapy. Median PFS by independent radiology committee (IRC) review was 7.4 months in 
the cabozantinib arm vs 3.8 months in the everolimus arm (HR 0.58 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.74]; p<0.0001). 
Median OS was 21.4 months in the cabozantinib arm vs 16.5 months in the everolimus arm (HR 0.66

[95% CI: 0.53, 0.83]; p=0.0003). Clinical benefit of cabozantinib was demonstrated across risk 
categories (by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center model): the HRs for PFS were 0.47 
(favourable), 0.48 (intermediate), and 0.67 (poor); the corresponding HRs for OS were 0.70, 0.65, 
and 0.7416 . 
The MAH now proposes to extend the indication to treatment-naïve patients. They have applied for the 
following indication:  
CABOMETYX is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in treatment-naïve 
adults with intermediate or poor risk per IMDC criteria.  
The application is based on Study A031203, a Phase 2, randomized, open-label study of previously 
untreated metastatic RCC (mRCC) subjects conducted to compare cabozantinib vs sunitinib 
cabozantinib vs sunitinib17. The study population consisted of untreated RCC subjects who were 
intermediate- or poor-risk per the IMDC criteria. Focus was directed toward subjects in these risk 
groups because the intermediate-/poor-risk groups comprise 80% of all subjects with RCC7. 
The agreed indication was as follows: 
CABOMETYX is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC): 
- in treatment-naïve adults with intermediate or poor risk (see section 5.1) 
- in adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applied Type II variation concerns extension of indication to include treatment of advanced renal 
cell carcinoma in treatment-naïve adults with intermediate or poor risk per IMDC criteria. With the 
initial MAA, an ERA was submitted based on the prevalence of RCC, leading to a PEC SURFACE WATER -value 
above 0.01 µg/L. In the course of the MA procedure, a refined  penetration factor (Fpen) was provided 
based on a justified estimate of prevalence for advanced RCC, including both first-line treatment and 
following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy. This led to a refined 
PECSURFACE WATER  value below 0.01 µg/L.  The final study report for the aqueous exposure 
bioaccumulation test with the bluegill (study ID 750A-102) has been provided, confirming that the 
bioconcentration factors (BCF) for whole fish tissue were well below the threshold values of 2000 or 
5000. Thus, cabozantinib is not a PBT substance. Consequently, cabozantinib is not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment.

2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH did not provide non-clinical data to support this indication, which is considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. The MAH submitted the final study report for the aqueous exposure bioaccumulation test 
with the bluegill (study ID 750A-102) for the ERA. Considering the above data, cabozantinib is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application suggests that there will be an increase in patient 
exposure to the product with the indication in the treatment of naïve patients with RCC. However, the 
ERA assessment in the initial marketing authorisation was conservative since the analysis captured the 
whole of the RCC population. Therefore, although there will be an increase in the use of the product in 
practice, the new analyses suggests that it is not expected to lead to a significant increase in 
environmental exposure further to the use of cabozantinib.

In all cases, there had to be complete recovery and no ongoing complications from prior 
radiation therapy. 
Treatments 
Subjects were treated with one of the following regimens: 
  Cabozantinib treatment arm: oral cabozantinib (60 mg) once-daily (qd) (as tablets) 
  Sunitinib treatment arm: oral sunitinib (50 mg) qd for 4 weeks (as capsules) followed by a 2-
week rest per cycle (approved dosing regimen from the registrational Phase 3 sunitinib study9 
One cycle was defined as 6 weeks in duration for each treatment arm. 
Cabozantinib was to be taken orally on an empty stomach following a 2-hour fast and subjects 
continued to fast for 1 hour after each dose. 
Sunitinib was administered without regard to meals. 
Subjects who had a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) continued 
treatment at the highest tolerable dose until the appearance of disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. Subjects who had disease progression were to receive a minimum of 2 cycles of therapy, but 
any subject with rapid disease progression was removed from treatment. 
Crossover between treatment arms was not prescribed by the protocol. Subsequent non-protocol 
therapy was documented.  
Table 3 summarizes the dose levels used in this study and the dose reductions allowed for 
unacceptable toxicity. Doses may have been modified at any time.

Table 3:  
Dose reductions 
No dose reductions were allowed below dose level -2 (20 mg cabozantinib and 25 mg sunitinib). If 
further dose reductions were required, study treatment was discontinued. Doses were not to be re-
escalated once reduced. 
If dosing with sunitinib or cabozantinib was interrupted for more than 6 weeks, subjects were to be 
discontinued from protocol treatment. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine if subjects with renal cancer treated with cabozantinib had 
improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with subjects treated with sunitinib.  
The secondary objectives were: 
 
 
To determine whether the response rate of subjects with renal cancer treated with 
cabozantinib was higher when compared with subjects treated with sunitinib. 
To determine whether subjects with renal cancer treated with cabozantinib had improved 
overall survival (OS) when compared with subjects treated with sunitinib. 
Companion Sub-Study (A031203-ST1): 
 
To determine whether renal cancer subjects with high hepatocyte growth factor receptor 
protein (MET) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) had improvement in PFS compared 
with subjects with low MET expression on both arms of this study. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is duration of progression-free survival (PFS). Duration of PFS is defined 
as the time from randomization to the earlier of the following events: disease progression as 
determined per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause. 
Tumour assessments of the chest/abdomen/pelvis (CAP) were performed in all subjects at 
registration/randomization (baseline) and every 12 weeks (± 10 days) after randomization while on 
study treatment. Post-treatment assessments continued every 12 weeks until progression or until 5 
years after randomization, whichever came first. A CT scan of the chest was preferable although 
lesions on chest X-ray were acceptable when clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. The 
abdomen/pelvis scan was performed by CT (or MRI). The same method of assessment was to be used 
to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. An MRI (or CT) 
scan of the brain was performed in all subjects at baseline. After randomization, MRI (or CT) scans of 
the brain were performed (only if the baseline brain scan was indicative of metastases or signs or 
symptoms of brain metastases subsequently developed) on the same schedule as the CAP scans.

Subjects who had a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) continued 
treatment at the highest tolerable dose until the appearance of disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity.  
Subjects who had disease progression were to receive a minimum of 2 cycles of therapy, but any 
subject with rapid disease progression was removed from treatment and details (ie, tumour 
measurements) were documented. After progression, subjects were followed every 6 months until 
death or 5 years after registration (randomization) for survival and second malignancy. 
Protocol-specified radiographic tumour assessments were evaluated per RECIST (v1.1; Eisenhauer et 
al 2009) by the Investigator. For the purposes of this submission, a blinded, central review of 
radiographic images to determine PFS and response rates per RECIST v1.1 was conducted 
retrospectively by an IRC. The IRC (MedQIA, Los Angeles, CA) comprised board-certified radiologists 
who determined radiographic response and progression following randomization. To minimize the 
potential introduction of bias, these individuals did not have any direct contact with the study site 
personnel or subjects. 
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints were OS (time from randomization to death from any cause) and ORR 
(proportion of subjects at the time of data cut-off with a best overall response of CR or PR per RECIST 
1.1 which was confirmed at a subsequent visit ≥ 28 days later). To be assigned a status of PR or CR, 
changes in tumour measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessment not less than 4 weeks 
after the criteria for response are first met. In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met 
the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of not less than 6-8 weeks. 
Sample size 
The study was designed by the Alliance to provide 85% power for an event-driven analysis of PFS to 
test the null hypothesis of no difference in PFS vs. an alternative hypothesis that the HR 
(λcabozantinib/λsunitinib) is 0.67 (assuming a median PFS time in the sunitinib arm of 8 months vs 12 
months in the cabozantinib arm) with a 1-sided type I error rate=0.12. The calculation was based on 
the COMPARZ RCC pazopanib vs sunitinib trial, which enrolled treatment-naïve subjects, but took into 
account that Study A031203 enrolled only intermediate- and poor-risk subjects, while the COMPARZ 
study also included patients with favourable risk status (25%).  
Assuming an accrual rate of 5.8 subjects/month over a 24-month enrollment period, follow-up of 20 
months after closure to randomization for the PFS endpoint, that PFS follows an exponential 
distribution, and allowing for 7% ineligibility rate: 123 events were required and the total sample size 
was 150 subjects.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized 1:1 to treatment with either cabozantinib or sunitinib.  
Subject enrolment was facilitated using the web-based Oncology Patient Enrolment Network (OPEN) 
registration system. Site staff used OPEN to enrol all subjects to this study. This system is integrated 
with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data and, upon enrolment, initializes the 
subject in the Medidata Rave database. The OPEN system provided the site with a confirmation of 
registration (randomization) and treatment information. 
Assessment report  
EMA/235286/2018  
Page 15/80 
 
 
 
 
 
Randomization was stratified by the following factors as assessed by the Investigator:  
•  Bone metastases at baseline 
a) yes 
b) no 
• 
IMDC risk categories: 
a) Intermediate (1-2 risk factors) 
b) Poor (3 or more risk factors)  
In order to meet the IMDC risk category criteria, subjects had to have one or more of the following six 
factors: 
 
Time from diagnosis of RCC to systemic treatment < 1 year 
  KPS score < 80% 
  Hgb < 13 g/dL (< 130 g/L) for males and < 11.5 g/dL (< 115 g/L) in females 
  Neutrophil count > upper limit of normal (ULN) 
 
Platelets > ULN 
  Corrected calcium > ULN 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. Study subjects, site personnel, and study teams at the Alliance had 
access to the actual randomized treatment assignment and the nature of the study treatment actually 
received. Exelixis had no access to any data before the Alliance completed their initial analysis of the 
study. Data review during the conduct of the study was conducted on unblinded data; however, a 
blinded, central review of radiographic images was conducted retrospectively by an IRC as an 
additional step to the protocol specified evaluation of PFS and response rates by the Investigator. The 
IRC reviewed all available radiographic images and was blinded to treatment identity and to clinical 
data that could have led to inadvertent unblinding. Treatment assigned and treatment received were 
excluded from the data review output unless necessary to conduct the review. 
Statistical methods 
Alliance censoring rules 
The analysis cut-off date is the date of the 123rd event. Subjects who experienced an event after this 
cut date or those who did not experience an event were right censored as of the date of their last 
tumour assessment available on or before the cut date. Subjects with no post-baseline tumour 
assessments were censored at date of randomization. 
Use of subsequent anticancer therapy or missing radiologic image data were not reasons for censoring 
progression per Alliance censoring rules. 
Exelixis analyses 
The SAP produced by Exelixis used the following censoring rules outlined in the FDA document 
‘Guidance for Industry-Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics, May 
2007’: 
Assessment report  
EMA/235286/2018  
Page 16/80 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Subjects who receive non-protocol systemic anticancer treatment (NPACT) after randomization and 
before experiencing an event will be right censored at the date of the last adequate tumour 
assessment (ATA) on or prior to the date of initiation of NPACT. 
•  Subjects who have not experienced an event (and are not otherwise censored) at the time of data 
cut-off will be right censored on the date of their last ATA prior to the cut-off date. 
•  Subjects who experience an interval corresponding to 2 or more consecutive scheduled tumour 
assessments (operationally defined as an interval > 178 days) without an ATA immediately 
followed by an event will be right censored on the date of their most-recent ATA prior to the 
missing/inadequate assessments. However, if such an interval is immediately followed by an ATA 
with an overall response of SD, PR, or CR, this will be deemed sufficient clinical evidence that 
progression did not occur during the period of missing data and the missing evaluations will be 
ignored. 
The application of FDA-recommended censoring rules for PFS necessarily reduces the number of events 
available for analysis. To increase the number of events that would be included in such analyses the 
data cut-off for radiographic endpoints was extended to September 15, 2016 (database extract 
January 13, 2017; the latest date for which OS data were available). The median time of follow-up at 
that data cut-off was 25.0 months. 
PFS analyses 
The date of the 123rd PFS event varies depending upon the source of RECIST evaluation (investigator 
or IRC) and the nature of censoring rules applied (Alliance or FDA-recommended). According to the 
SAP, if a given combination of RECIST evaluation and censoring rules yields < 123 PFS events the 
analysis cut-off date is 15 September 2016 (the date of last scans available for independent 
evaluation). 
The Exelixis SAP describes the following PFS analyses to be performed: 
• 
Investigator-determined PFS (progression per RECIST 1.1 as determined by the investigator, or 
death): 
o  Using the censoring rules per the Alliance group (PFS1) 
o 
Investigator-determined PFS with implementation of FDA-recommended censoring rules 
(PFS2) 
• 
Inclusion of clinical outcomes (“clinical claims”) as events (PFS3-4) 
•  Aligning radiographic progression dates with the planned assessment schedule (“uniform dates”) to 
address the potential for inconsistent imaging frequency between arms (PFS5-6)  
•  Radiographic progression per independent radiology committee (IRC) review (when data are 
available): 
o  By Alliance and FDA-recommended censoring rules (PFS7-8) 
o  With “uniform dates” adjustment (PFS9-10) 
To explore the effect of potentially informative censoring on investigator assessments, four sensitivity 
analyses (PFS21-24) based on the rules per PFS2 analyses will be conducted in the ITT population by 
reclassifying subjects censored for potentially informative reasons as events differentially between the 
treatment arms in various patterns.  
Assessment report  
EMA/235286/2018  
Page 17/80 
 
 
 
 
 
When IRC data are available, these analyses will be repeated as PFS81-PFS84 by reclassifying 
censored subjects per the PFS8 definition.  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted amongst all subjects in the ITT population. Hypothesis testing 
between the two treatment arms will be performed using the stratified logrank test. Two-sided p-
values will be presented. The stratification factors are those used to stratify the randomization. 
Unstratified results will also be provided. 
The median duration of PFS and the associated 95% confidence interval for each treatment arm will be 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The stratified and unstratified HRs and the corresponding 
95% confidence intervals will be estimated using a Cox regression model.  
Interim analysis 
A single interim futility analysis of PFS was conducted by the Alliance at the 50% information fraction. 
The criterion for futility was not met. The study therefore continued to the primary endpoint analysis. 
Following the interim analysis, the DSMB recommended at the 07 November 2014 meeting that the 
trial continue without change. 
Multiplicity 
No adjustments were made for multiple analyses. 
Overall survival and Objective response rate 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are ORR and duration of OS. Formal hypothesis 
testing was not planned for key secondary efficacy endpoints and p-values are presented without 
adjustment for multiple endpoints. 
The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with the best overall response of complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed per RECIST 1.1, which is confirmed by a subsequent visit ≥  
28 days later. Key analysis of ORR are performed with the same data cut-off as the corresponding PFS 
analysis, using all subjects in the ITT population. Subjects who do not have any post-baseline tumour 
assessments are counted as non-responders. Two-sided p-values were generated using the Fisher’s 
exact test. Analysis using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method to adjust for the randomization 
stratification factors arealso presented. 
A summary of BOR includes: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The count and proportion of subjects with best overall response of CR, PR, SD, PD and unable-
to-evaluate (UE). Reasons for UE will be provided. 
Point estimates of ORR with confidence intervals calculated using exact methods 
The difference in response rates between the two treatment arms and associated 
confidence intervals 
The odds ratio and corresponding p-value  
Analyses are provided for both investigator-determined response and response per IRC (when data are 
available). Waterfall plots showing best percentage change in target lesion size as assessed by the 
investigator and IRC are also  presented for each treatment group using the ITT population. 
Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. 
All data available as of 13Jan2017 were considered for the analyses of OS. For subjects who are alive 
at the time of data cut-off or are permanently lost to follow-up, duration of OS are right censored at 
the earlier of the following: date the subject withdrew consent from all follow-up, data cut-off date, or 
the date the subject was last known to be alive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/235286/2018  
Page 18/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OS (months) = (date of death or censoring – date of randomization + 1)/30.4375 
The statistical methods employed for the analyses of OS are the same as those described for the 
analyses of primary endpoint of PFS (Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression). 
Duration of Objective Response (DOR) 
Duration of objective response, defined as the time from the tumour assessment that first documents 
PR or CR that is subsequently confirmed at least 28 days later until the date of documented 
radiographic progression, per RECIST 1.1. Only subjects with confirmed CR or PR are included in this 
analysis. 
Duration of objective response (months) = (earliest date of progression, death or censoring – date of 
first documented objective response + 1)/30.4375 
The duration of objective response will be analysed per statistical methods described above. Analysis 
per investigator and IRC is presented using the following 2 censoring rules (Alliance group and FDA 
guidance). 
Subgroups for Efficacy Analyses  
The following subgroup analyses were performed to further examine the robustness of the findings in 
this study. Forest plots are presented for the subgroup analyses. The analysis of OS, ORR, PFS per 
investigator using Alliance and FDA censoring rules and PFS per IRC per FDA censoring rules were 
repeated in each of the following subgroups: 
•  Age (< 65 years, ≥  65 years) 
•  Gender (female, male) 
•  Race (White, Other) 
• 
ECOG performance status (0, 1, 2) 
•  Bone metastases at baseline-stratification factor at randomization (Yes, No) 
•  Heng Criteria – stratification factor at randomization (Intermediate [1-2], Poor [3-6]) 
• 
cMET status (Positive, Negative, Missing)

Flow Chart of Subject Disposition as of 15 September 2016 (ITT Population) 
Disposition results based on the PFS endpoint cut-off date (11 April 2016), previously reported by the 
Alliance were similar to those of the 15 September 2016 cut-off date. As of 11 April 2016, 66 patients 
(84%) in the cabozantinib arm and 76 patients (97%) in the sunitinib arm had discontinued study 
treatment18. 
Disposition results based on the OS database cut-off date (13 January 2017) were similar to those of 
the 15 September 2016 cut-off date. As of 13 January 2017, 71 patients (90%) in the cabozantinib 
arm and 76 patients (97%) in the sunitinib arm had discontinued study treatment.  
As of 15 September 2016, 40 patients in the cabozantinib arm (51%) and 29 patients in the  sunitinib 
arm were in survival follow-up.

Recruitment 
Study Period: 15 July 2013 (first subject enrolled) – 13 January 2017 (data cut-off date for overall 
survival). 
All 77 sites in the study were located in the United States. 
Conduct of the study 
Overall survival analyses were conducted with the most mature OS data available from the Alliance 
(through a cut-off date of 13 January 2017). The cut-off dates for the key efficacy endpoints are 
provided in Table 4. 
Table 4: Data Cut-off Dates for Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
There were 8 amendments to the Original Protocol. With the exception of the introduction of 
retrospective IRC data collection in the most recent Protocol Update 8 (21. Oct. 2016), none of the 
protocol updates had a substantial impact on the collection or analysis of the study’s primary or 
secondary objectives. Most of the protocol changes were clarifications, and mainly affected the safety 
evaluation. 
SAP 
A SAP was not prospectively developed by the Alliance. The Exelixis SAP, which was developed after 
release of the Alliance results, describes statistical analyses that Exelixis conducted retrospectively to 
meet the requirements of a regulatory submission, including the full set of prior history, baseline, 
demographics, study treatment, safety, and efficacy summaries required for an ICH-compliant study 
report. Further, although the Alliance protocol employed 1-sided p-values, for consistency with 
Exelixis-sponsored pivotal study reports, all p-values presented are 2-sided unless otherwise specified. 
The Exelixis SAP v1 was approved on 31 May 2017, prior to the receipt of IRC results. The protocol did 
not feature IRC review of radiographic images until Update 8 (21. Oct. 2016), after the date of the 
original Alliance analysis (11. April 2016). The Exelixis SAP specifies analyses of the IRC data. 
The protocol did not implement event and censoring definitions for primary PFS analysis, nor were 
sensitivity analyses included to address the potential for bias arising from inconsistent imaging 
schedules or informative censoring. The Exelixis SAP specified a set of PFS analyses consistent with 
FDA guidance (see Statistical methods).

Subjects were required to not have received prior systemic treatment for RCC. No subjects in the 
cabozantinib arm received prior systemic treatment. One subject who received study treatment in the 
sunitinib arm received ‘Prior Therapy Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)’. Another subject in the sunitinib 
arm received prior ‘Drug and/or Immunotherapy’ (drug name not specified); this subject did not 
receive study treatment. 
No subjects in either treatment arm received the wrong study treatment or dosing levels not defined in 
the protocol.

PFS according to EU censoring rules 
There were 5 patients in the cabozantinib arm who had events after having two or more missed visits, 
and none in the sunitinib arm. According to the FDA censoring rules these patients were censored. 
Table 13 below presents results according to EU censoring rules (these 5 patients were not censored) 
and FDA censoring rules (same 5 patients censored). PFS was determined by the IRC using analyses 
as per EMA censoring rules. In the EU analysis the HR was 0.48 (95%CI 0.32, 0.73; p=0.0005). In the 
analysis using the FDA-recommended censoring rules, the HR was 0.48 (95% CI 0.31, 0.74; p = 
0.0008).

Investigator and IRC concordance on PD 
The overall concordance for PD was 75%. The Investigator and IRC agreed on subjects’ radiographic 
PD status (ie, radiographic PD yes vs no; subjects with ≥ 1 tumour assessment per Investigator and 
per IRC) 69% of the time for the cabozantinib arm and 84% of the time for the sunitinib arm (Table 
15). When both the Investigator and IRC agreed that radiographic PD had occurred, the Investigator 
and IRC agreed on the dates of PD 63% of the time for the cabozantinib arm and 56% of the time for 
the sunitinib arm.

MET status information was determined from an optional sub-study (A031203-ST1). Subjects who declined to 
participate in that optional sub-study are summarized as missing. Positive MET status is based on cutoff of ≥ 50% 
of tumor cells stained 2+ or 3+ (moderate or higher intensity) by  immunohistochemistry, negative status is < 50% 
of tumor cells stained 2+ or 3+ (includes samples with no staining). 
Results are presented based on censoring per FDA-recommended censoring rules (Section 9.7.1.2.1). 
HRs were estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model. HR < 1 indicates PFS in favor of cabozantinib.

Secondary Endpoint: Overall Survival 
The Exelixis analysis of OS included one more event in the cabozantinib arm and 4 additional events in 
the sunitinib arm, compared to the Alliance analysis. The median time of follow up for OS (through 13 
January 2017) was 28.9 months.

Alliance analysis of Overall survival (Choueiri et al 2017) 
As of September 15, 2016, the median follow-up of surviving patients was 21.4 months. Overall, 37 
deaths had occurred in the cabozantinib arm and 41 in the sunitinib arm. Median OS with cabozantinib 
was 30.3 months (95% CI, 14.6 to 35.0 months) versus 21.8 months (95% CI, 16.3 to 27.0 months) 
with sunitinib (adjusted HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.26). 
The Alliance presented OS results at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual 
meeting in September 2017, based on an analysis they conducted with a data cut-off of 01 July 2017 
(Choueiri ESMO presentation 2017).

Subsequent systemic non-radiation anticancer therapies 
The arithmetic median (range) time to first systemic non-radiation anticancer therapy was longer in 
the cabozantinib arm: 196 (56, 877) days in the cabozantinib arm and 147 (4, 725) days in the 
sunitinib arm.  
After progression, systemic non-protocol anticancer therapy (NPACT) was used by a similar proportion 
of subjects in each arm: 57% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 58% in the sunitinib arm. 
Similar proportions of patients used VEGFR-TKI therapy; 46% and 45%, and Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
targeting agents, 13% and 15%, in the cabozantinib arm and sunitinib arm, respectively. There was a 
higher usage of everolimus in the sunitinib arm (cabozantinib arm 8% vs sunitinib arm 19%), while

there was a higher use of temsirolimus in the cabozantinib arm (cabozantinib arm 9% vs sunitinib arm 
4%). Crossover between study arms was not prescribed in this study. However, 5 patients (6%) in the 
sunitinib arm received cabozantinib after progression.

Note: Date for the following subjects are not included in this figure: 14 subjects (cabozantinib 2, sunitinib 12) did 
not have post-baseline data. In addition, three subjects (cabozantinib 2, sunitinib 1) had only nontarget lesions 
(response of non-CR/non-PD); 7 subjects (cabozantinib 3, sunitinib 4) were unevaluable due to NPACT; disease 
progression was assessed for 5 subjects (cabozantinib 2, sunitinib 3) on the basis of new lesions or progression in 
non-target lesions, target lesions did not contribute to the assessment. Additionally, 1 cabozantinib subject with an 
overall response of UE did not have any post-baseline target lesions measured. 
Duration of Response 
Median duration of response per IRC using FDA-recommended censoring rules was not reached (95% 
CI 8.5 months, NE) in the cabozantinib arm and was 8.1 (95% CI 6.0, NE) months in the sunitinib 
arm. The stratified HR was 0.21 (0.05, 0.90) in favour of cabozantinib. 
Median duration of response per Investigator using FDA-recommended censoring rules was 17.4 (95% 
CI 11.7, NE) months in the cabozantinib arm and 11.0 (95% CI 7.6, NE) months in the sunitinib arm. 
The stratified HR was 0.39 (0.12, 1.26) in favour of cabozantinib. 
Time to Response 
The arithmetic median (range) time from randomization to the first assessment which showed IRC-
determined response that was subsequently confirmed was 4.91 (2.6, 10.9) months in the 
cabozantinib arm and 5.78 (2.6, 22.3) months in the sunitinib arm.  
The corresponding median (range) time from randomization to the first assessment which showed 
Investigator-determined response that was subsequently confirmed was 2.91 (1.3, 13.0) months in 
the cabozantinib arm and 3.09 (2.6, 16.7) months in the sunitinib arm. 
Expression of MET 
All subjects were asked for their consent to participate in the sub-study of MET expression by the 
tumor tissue, though participation was optional. Required tissue included paraffin-embedded tissue 
obtained from earlier biopsies or nephrectomies.

Ancillary analyses 
Additional analyses of PFS 
A set of alternative analyses (censoring per FDA-recommended rules) based on IRC-determined and 
Investigator-determined data and supportive analyses using alternative definitions of progression 
(Uniform dates or Clinical claims), and sensitivity analyses using alternative definitions of informative 
censoring were performed (see Statistical methods for description of analyses).

b Uniform dates: aligns radiographic progression dates with the planned assessment schedule to address the

c Clinical claims: inclusion of clinical outcomes as events per FDA-recommended censoring rules 
d To explore the effect of potentially informative censoring resulting from (a) discontinuation of study treatment for 
reasons other than radiographic progression with no NPACT or (b) receipt of NPACT prior to progression, four IRC-
determined sensitivity analyses, designated Scheme 1-4, were conducted based on censoring of subjects per FDA-
recommended rules:  
- Scheme 1: censored subjects meeting criterion (a) were classified as events in both treatment arms. 
- Scheme 2: censored subjects meeting criteria (a) or (b) were classified as events in both treatment arms.  
- Scheme 3: censored subjects in the cabozantinib arm meeting criterion (a) were classified as events in the 
cabozantinib arm and remained censored in the sunitinib arm.  
- Scheme 4 (the most conservative analysis): censored subjects in the cabozantinib arm meeting criteria (a) or (b) 
were classified as events in the cabozantinib arm and remained censored in the sunitinib arm.

CABOMETYX is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in treatment-naïve 
adults with intermediate or poor risk per IMDC criteria.  
Exelixis collaborated with Alliance personnel to gain access to the study data and undertook activities 
to prepare this study report for regulatory submission.

The application is based on one Phase 2, randomized, open-label study of cabozantinib vs sunitinib, 
Study A031203. The study was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy 
Evaluation Program (CTEP) and conducted by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (the Alliance). 
The study was performed according to the Alliance Policies and Procedures 2013 and sites were 
audited and monitored for the central review of key data to ensure data integrity for analyses of 
primary and secondary endpoints. The primary and secondary endpoints of Study A031203 were 
originally analysed by the Alliance and reported in the literature18, 19..  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) was developed retrospectively and activities to bring the study to fit 
current registrational requirements  included: forming an IRC to conduct retrospective independent 
image review, facilitating radiographic image retrieval for the IRC, facilitating source-data verification 
on a sample of study data (63 subjects across 35 sites). 
Patient population 
The study population was considered relevant for the proposed indication where patients should not 
have received any prior anticancer therapy. Study A031203 included patients with histologically 
confirmed locally advanced or metastatic RCC complying with intermediate or poor-risk factors 
according to the IMDC criteria. MSKCC (Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Centre model) has been the 
gold standard for the risk assessment during cytokine treatment in metastatic RCC. Further refinement 
was introduced with the IMDC model, which has been validated against the MSKCC model. The IMDC 
model was shown to give the best model fit7. Patients with ECOG 0-2 were allowed in the study, which 
is acceptable.  
Comparator 
Patients in the control arm were treated with sunitinib. ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, 
treatment and follow-up of renal cell carcinoma (2016) presents an algorithm for systemic treatment in 
mRCC with a clear cell component. According to the algorithm, sunitinib is the recommended first-line 
treatment of clear cell RCC for patients with good or intermediate risk, while temsirolimus is the first 
choice in patients with poor risk, however, with sunitinib as a “reasonable alternative”. Thus, the 
comparator is considered adequate. 
Treatments 
Based on treatment assignment, subjects were randomized (1:1) to one of the following regimens: 
−  Cabozantinib treatment arm: oral cabozantinib (60 mg) once-daily (qd) (as tablets) 
−  Sunitinib treatment arm: oral sunitinib (50 mg) qd for 4 weeks (as capsules) followed by a 2-week 
rest per cycle (approved dosing regimen from the registrational Phase 3 sunitinib study; Motzer et 
al [N Engl J Med] 2007) 
Both treatments are in accordance with the approved SmPC for Cabometyx and Sutent.  
Blinding 
Study A031203 is an open-label study, and thus, there is a clear risk of bias. Originally, there was no 
independent review of radiographic scans. However, Exelixis retrospectively introduced central 
independent review of all scans. Ideally, independent review should be performed consecutively. 
However, many oncology trials deviate from the recommendations in the cancer guideline (Guideline 
19 Choueiri TK, Halabi S, Sanford B, Hahn O, Michaelson MD, Walsh M, et al. CABOzantinib versus SUNitinib (CABOSUN) as 
initial targeted therapy for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) of poor and intermediate risk groups:

http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2017/11/WC50023876
4.pdf) of conducting real-time independent review before taking patients off treatment. The IRC 
reviewed all available radiographic images and was blinded to treatment identity and to clinical data 
that could have led to inadvertent unblinding. Thus, the retrospective introduction of IRC could be 
considered adequate.  
The non-blinded fashion of the study could be problematic in terms of patient compliance and 
adherence to the study plan. However, the patients in the control arm were treated with the current 
standard of care and there were no clear indications in advance of the study that cabozantinib would 
be a more favourable treatment than sunitinib. 
Sample size 
The study was originally designed by the Alliance to provide 85% power for an event-driven analysis of 
PFS, and 123 events were required. The sample size was based on an assumption of a median PFS in 
the sunitinib arm of 8 months, with background in the COMPARZ study of pazopanib vs sunitinib. The 
sample size calculation gave an estimated sample size of 150 subject. The study enrolled 79 patients 
in the cabozantinib arm and 78 patients in the sunitinib arm.  
Endpoints 
The primary endpoint of this study was originally PFS by Investigator using RECIST 1.1., with ORR and 
OS as secondary endpoints. With the SAP, IRC determined PFS was introduced, and is considered the 
most robust endpoint, although not explicitly stated to be the primary endpoint. The results of both 
analyses are presented in the SmPC in section 5.1. PFS is considered acceptable as primary endpoint 
for cabozantinib in this setting. Results from the METEOR study indicates that there is a correlation 
between PFS and OS for cabozantinib. Tumour assessments were performed every 12 weeks (± 10 
days) while on study treatment. In the METEOR study, which formed the basis for the MA for 
Cabometyx, tumour assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months, then every 12 
weeks thereafter. A shorter interval between assessments in the current study would have been 
preferred to give a more accurate estimate of the time of progression. In addition, 12 weeks is 
concurrent with the end of the 2-weeks rest in the sunitinib arm, which may have been unfortunate for 
this study arm but does not raised any serious concerns.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized 1:1 to treatment with either cabozantinib or sunitinib. Randomization was 
stratified by the presence or not of bone metastasis at baseline and IMDC risk categories, Intermediate 
or Poor. Additional, stratification by ECOG and age would have been preferred as they are important 
risk factors. Fortunately, the study arms turned out quite well balanced also according to these factors.  
Statistics 
Standard methods were used to estimate PFS, OS and ORR. 
The Exelixis SAP v1 was approved on 31 May 2017, prior to the receipt of IRC results. At this time 
point, the outcome of the Alliance analyses was known. The SAP implemented event and censoring 
definitions recommended by FDA guidance, a.o. this included right censoring of subjects who received 
non-protocol systemic anticancer treatment (NPACT) before experiencing an event. Exelixis also 
implemented sensitivity analyses to address the potential for bias arising from inconsistent imaging 
schedules or informative censoring. The application of FDA-recommended censoring rules for PFS 
reduced the number of events available for analysis compared to the Alliance analysis. To increase the 
number of events, the data cut-off for radiographic endpoints was extended to September 15, 2016 
Assessment report  
EMA/235286/2018 
Page 44/80 
 
 
  
(database extract January 13, 2017; the latest date for which OS data were available). The median 
time of follow-up at that data cut-off was 25.0 months. 
As the initial protocol specified analysis was positive it does not create multiplicity concerns that the 
MAH then conducted a new analysis for the purposes of the submission. The analysis was fully 
specified in the SAP before results from the IRC scan readings, on which the analysis was based, were 
available. 
According to the Applicant, the Alliance did not document protocol deviations in the database because 
the statistical data analysis was based on the ITT population and no separate analyses related to 
protocol deviations were included. Still, for monitoring of the study conduct it seems inappropriate not 
to register protocol deviations. On request, the Applicant has provided a PP analysis which excluded 10 
patients. The results of these analyses are in line with the results of the primary ITT analyses (data not 
shown).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
PFS 
PFS determined by the IRC using FDA-recommended censoring rules showed a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS for subjects in the cabozantinib arm compared with the sunitinib arm. The HR 
adjusted for stratification factors was 0.48 (95% CI 0.31, 0.74; p = 0.0008). The median duration of 
PFS was estimated to be 8.6 months in the cabozantinib arm vs 5.3 months in the sunitinib arm. 
Taking into account that the patients are intermediate and poor risk, a 3 months prolongation in PFS is 
considered clinically relevant.  
If PFS is analysed according to EU censoring rules, there were 5 patients in the cabozantinib arm who 
had events after being censored for having two or more missed visits, and none in the sunitinib arm. 
Consequently, including these patients was the same 0.48 (95%CI 0.32, 0.73; p=0.0005), compared 
to 0.48 (0.31, 0.74) p=0.0008. 
The IRC-determined PFS result was supported by the Investigator PFS analysis and sensitivity analyses 
of PFS. 
For the sample size assumptions, PFS was estimated to 8 months in the sunitinib arm based on the 
COMPARZ study of pazopanib vs sunitinib which included also favourable risk patients (25%). In the 
registrational study for sunitinib in RCC (Phase 3 trial vs IFN-alfa) the median PFS was estimated to 
10.7 months in the intermediate risk patients and 2.5 months in the poor risk patients13. According to 
subgroup analyses of PFS, sunitinib seems to be underperforming in intermediate risk patients in the 
current study with a median PFS of 6.1 months. It is possible that the shorter median PFS in Study 
A031203 could be due to differences in baseline risk factors between the studies, e.g. the current 
study allowed patients with ECOG 2 (10 patients in each arm [13%]). The confidence interval for the 
poor risk group, although wide (only 15 patients in each arm), was below 1, i.e. in favour of 
cabozantinib. Median PFS was 6.8 months and 2.7 months in the cabozantinib arm and sunitinib arm, 
respectively. Sunitinib performed in accordance with the analyses by Rini mentioned above. 
Considering the small patient group, no definite conclusion can be drawn, but it seems reasonable to 
conclude that cabozantinib is not inferior to sunitinib for patients in the poor risk category. 
Both MET positive and MET negative patients seem to benefit from treatment with cabozantinib 
compared to sunitinib, with the most favourable PFS HR in the MET positive patients, HR 0.32 (95% 
CI: 0.16, 0.63). PFS analysis in the MET negative patients resulted in a HR of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.37, 
1.23) (SmPC section 5.1).  
Assessment report  
EMA/235286/2018 
Page 45/80 
 
 
  
For patients with ECOG 2, there was no difference between the treatment arms; HR 0.96 (95% CI 
0.27, 3.49). There were only 10 patients in each arm with ECOG 2 and only 5 and 6 patients with an 
event in the cabozantinib arm and the sunitinib arm, respectively. Thus, no conclusion can be drawn 
regarding these patients. 
Efficacy analyses were conducted on the ITT population, i.e. patients who never received any 
treatment were included in these analyses, i.e. 7 patients (7/157; 4.4%) never received treatment, 6 
of them in the sunitinib arm. Excluding these patients from the analysis, gives a similar result as the 
primary analysis. Also when excluding 10 patients that in retrospect were found to be protocol 
violators, the result is similar to the primary ITT analysis. The overall concordance for Investigator and 
IRC determined PD was 75%. The largest discordance between Investigator and IRC Read pertained to 
PD in the cabozantinib arm, i.e. the Investigator read PD while the IRC did not for 18 patients (23%). 
Thus, it seems the Investigator was not biased in favour of the cabozantinib arm. 
OS 
The median time of follow up for OS (through 13 January 2017) was 28.9 months. The Kaplan-Meier 
estimates for median duration of OS were 30.3 months (95% CI 14.6, NE) in the cabozantinib arm vs 
21.0 months (95% CI 16.3, 27.0) in the sunitinib arm in the Exelixis analysis, an estimated 9.3 
months difference in the medians. The difference between treatment arms did not reach statistical 
significance; HR adjusted for stratification factors 0.74 (95% CI 0.47, 1.14; p = 0.1700). Although 
more than 50% of the patients have had an OS event overall, less than half of the patients in the 
cabozantinib arm have died, and there is a notable degree of censoring around the medians. 
Considering that PFS analyses showed an approximately 3 months improvement with cabozantinib 
compared with sunitinib, the median OS gain of 9 months is clearly overestimated. Taking into account 
the long time between progression and death, it is likely that non-protocol anticancer therapy (NPACT) 
has influenced the result. After progression, systemic NPACT was used by a similar proportion of 
subjects in each arm (57-58%). Five patients (6%) in the sunitinib arm received cabozantinib after 
progression.  
Based on this analysis, it may be concluded that cabozantinib does not have a detrimental effect on 
survival compared to sunitinib. More recently, the Alliance presented OS results at the European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual meeting in September 2017, based on an analysis they 
conducted with a data cut-off of 01 July 2017 (Choueiri ESMO presentation 2017). This analysis 
includes 7 more deaths. The result of this analysis is similar to the two previous analyses, with a HR of 
0.80, 95% CI (0.53, 1.21), p=0.2885. According to the Applicant, the study is planned to be closed, 
and no further survival analyses are planned. None of the OS analyses shows statistically significant 
improvement in OS. Despite some crossing of the curves, cabozantinib does not seem to have a 
detrimental effect on OS. 
 ORR 
The IRC-determined ORR was 20% (95% CI 12.0, 30.8) in the cabozantinib arm, compared with 9% 
(95% CI 3.7, 17.6) in the sunitinib arm (p=0.0406). All the subjects who had a confirmed response in 
either treatment arm had PRs. The Investigator analysis, considered more patients to have response. 
This is largely due to more patients being categorized as having stable disease in the IRC-analysis. 
Thus, the disease control rate (SD+PR+CR) seems similar across analyses, i.e. 74% - 75% in the 
cabozantinib arm and 47% - 49% in the sunitinib arm. 
Correlative sub-study (A031203-ST1) 
A correlative sub-study (A031203-ST1) has also been conducted. All subjects were asked for their 
consent to participate in the optional sub-study. This study was also performed to assess target

inhibition, tumour response, bone response and resistance to targeted therapies. However, the data 
analysis is now not planned.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Cabozantinib was approved in the EU for treatment of adults following prior vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy, based on the results of the phase III study XL184-308. The 
new clinical data in this submission are derived from the phase II study A031203, in treatment-naïve 
advanced RCC adults with intermediate or poor risk per IMDC criteria. In this study, cabozantinib 
demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in PFS, with a favourable 
trend in overall survival. The ORR was also higher in the cabozantinib arm relative to sunitinib. The 
superiority of cabozantinib over sunitinib may reflect cabozantinib’s mechanistic profile, that includes 
inhibition not only of VEGFR but also of MET and AXL. In support of this, increased PFS benefit is seen 
in those patients that were shown to be high MET expressers.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Summary of existing safety profile 
The safety profile of Cabometyx in the existing indication was established based on a phase 3, 
randomized, controlled study of cabozantinib (so called “METEOR study”) vs everolimus in subjects 
with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has progressed after prior VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
therapy. 
The safety profile of cabozantinib was found similar to other VEGFR-TKIs used to treat RCC. Overall, 
the safety profile of cabozantinib in RCC appears manageable and no major safety concerns were 
raised. 
Clinical safety for new indication 
The safety data for this extension of indication in advanced RCC treatment naïve patients is based on 
Study A031203, a randomized phase II study comparing cabozantinib with commercially supplied 
sunitinib in subjects with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

a Duration of exposure = (date of decision to discontinue study treatment – date of first dose + 1)/30.4375. For 
subjects still on study, duration of exposure = (data cut-off date – date of first dose +1)/30.4375. 
b Average daily dose = total doses received (mg) / sum of duration of exposure (days) for each cycle.  
c Outliers likely arise from idiosyncrasies in data collection in the sunitinib arm, as dose data were collected by 
cycle; sunitinib was administered qd for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest per cycle.  
d Percent dose intensity of cabozantinib = 100*(average daily dose mg/day) / (60 mg/day) and for sunitinib 
calculated as 100*(average daily dose mg/day) / (50 mg/day). 
The median average daily doses of cabozantinib and sunitinib were above the protocol defined first 
dose reduction level: 50.3 mg and 44.7 mg, respectively. In both treatment arms, the median dose 
intensity was > 80% the protocol-defined maximum dose. Re-escalation after dose reductions were 
not allowed.

AE, adverse event; MedDRA, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; SAE, serious adverse event A small 
fraction of the total AEs reported could not be coded in MedDRA at the time of the data cutoff, and limited 
information is available on the nature of these events. Only ten of the events were Grade 3, and none had a 
severity of Grade 4 or 5. Since the majority events were low grade, it is unlikely that these events would 
significantly impact the overall safety evaluation from the study. 
Subjects are counted only once in each category but may be counted in multiple categories. Incidence of solicited 
and unsolicited AEs or SAEs. Unsolicited Grade 1 and 2 events not related to study treatment were not collected. 
For incidence of specific solicited or unsolicited preferred terms see Table 40 (AEs) or Table 46 (SAEs). 
a Cabozantinib subject 9101012 experienced a related Grade 4 AE of jejunal perforation and subsequently died < 
30 days after receiving the last dose of study treatment; the initially reported cause of death for this subject was 
tumor (ie, progressive disease). However, follow-up reporting included in the safety narrative but not the clinical 
database indicates that the Investigator later re-assessed the cause of death as jejunal perforation (Grade 5 AE 
related to study treatment).  
b Grade 5 AEs were not reported for 3 subjects (1 cabozantinib, 2 sunitinib) who died < 30 days after the last dose 
of study treatment.  
c Grade 1 or 2 SAEs that did not entail hospitalization ≥  24 h were not recorded in the clinical database.

Denominators for percentages are N, the total number of subjects in each treatment arm. At each level of 
summarization, a subject was counted once for the most severe event if the subject reported one or more events. 
A total of 25 subjects (32%) in the cabozantinib arm and 18 subjects (25%) subjects in the sunitinib arm had 
reported verbatim terms that were uncoded. Four uncoded Grade 3 events were reported for 4 subjects (5.1%) in 
the cabozantinib arm, and 6 were reported for 5 subjects (6.9%) in the sunitinib arm. There were no Grade 4 or 5 
uncoded events. The Grade 3 events had the following verbatim-text descriptions:  
 c a b o z a n t in ib  a r m :  p u lm o n a r y  e m b o lis m ,  a c u t e  r e n a l fa ilu r e ,  b u r n ,  a n d  h y p o p h o s p h a t e m ia .  
 s u n it in ib  a r m :  d ifficulty swallowing, stomatitis, polycythemia, planned craniotomy surgery, scrotum rash, and  
herpes zoster.  
Note that Grade 1 or 2 unsolicited AEs were only required to be collected if the Investigator considered them to be 
treatment related. Note that there is no CTCAE Grade 1 category for pancreatitis or Grade 4 category for fatigue or 
PPES.  
a Events of embolism from the Exelixis cabozantinib global safety database included pulmonary embolism, deep 
vein thrombosis, stroke, thrombosis of the axillary artery, or thrombosis of the left internal carotid artery. In 
addition, there was one uncoded Grade 3 AE described as a ‘pulmonary embolism’ reported in the cabozantinib arm. 
For the following AEs, there were ≥ 10% higher incidence in the cabozantinib arm relative to the 
sunitinib arm: AST increased, ALT increased, hypertension, dysphonia, diarrhoea, hypothyroidism, 
decreased appetite, weight decreased, alopecia, dermatitis acneiform, dysgeusia, dry skin, 
hypomagnesemia, dyspepsia, and embolism.  
For the following AEs, there were ≥ 10% higher incidence in the sunitinib arm relative to the 
cabozantinib arm: platelet count decreased, white blood cell count decreased, neutrophil count 
decreased, anaemia, and muscular weakness.  
Comparison of Study A031203 and METEOR 
A comparison of AEs in the cabozantinib arm of Study A031203 and the cabozantinib arm of the 
METEOR study in patients previously treated with a VEGF-targeted therapy was also performed (Table 
29). Dose and exposure were similar in the two studies. The study populations are, however, not 
identical. The METEOR study allowed all three RCC risk categories (20% were favourable), while Study 
A031203 was limited to patients with intermediate and poor risk. In the METEOR study, ECOG status 
was limited to 0 and 1, while in Study A031203 patients also with ECOG 2 were allowed.  
There are also differences between the studies regarding collection of AEs.

− 
In study A031203, dose and AE data were collected by cycle and non-AE data (laboratory values, 
vital signs) were not collected. In the METEOR study a complete set of dose, AE, and non-AE data 
were provided. 
In Study A031203, the Investigator entered into the CRF an AE term from the limited CTCAE v4 
list. This list provides fewer specific terms than those available using MedDRA terms in the METEOR 
study.

−  All AEs were unsolicited in the METEOR study whereas in study A031203 AEs were collected as 
either solicited AEs or unsolicited AEs. Grade 1 or 2 unsolicited AEs not related to study treatment 
were not required to be reported in Study A031203 whereas all grades of AEs were reported in 
METEOR. 
−  SAEs were collected in study A031203 if they met requirements for being expedited in the 
Investigator’s opinion, regardless of medical importance (or were Grade 5 AEs). This was done for 
completeness. However, these events identified as expedited included non-serious events thereby 
leading to a potential over-reporting of the incidence of SAEs. In METEOR, all SAEs were collected 
on a specific CRF page.

Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
Frequently reported treatment-related AEs are summarized in Table 30. Overall, the number of 
subjects with treatment-related AEs was similar between treatment arms (cabozantinib arm 95%, 
sunitinib arm 97%). Grade 3/4 treatment related AEs were reported in respectively 60% and 63% of 
the subjects in the cabozantinib and sunitinib arm.  
Of the treatment related AEs, there were clearly more (>10% difference) of the following AEs with 
cabozantinib compared to sunitinib: diarrhoea (72% vs 49%), hypertension (56% vs 38%), PPES 
(42% vs 32%), decreased appetite (45% vs 31%), dysgeusia (41% vs 29%), weight decreased (31% 
vs 17%), hypothyroidism (22% vs 5.6%), dysphonia (21% vs 1.4%), hypomagnesaemia (21% vs 
11%), dry skin (19% vs 8.3%), alopecia (17% vs 2.8%), dermatitis acneiform (15% vs 2.8%), in 
addition to liver enzyme elevations. 
The treatment-related AEs that were more frequent (>10% difference) in the sunitinib arm than in the 
cabozantinib arm, were related to blood counts, i.e. decreased platelets (58% vs 37%), neutrophils 
(35% vs 15%), WBC (35% vs 12%) and anaemia (44% vs 29%). There were also more 
hyponatraemia (18% vs 7.7%) and muscular weakness (14% vs 3.8%).   
It is known from the METEOR study that diarrhoea, PPES, fatigue, and hypertension were the most 
frequent AEs leading to dose modification. The reason for dose modification was not collected in study 
A031203.

Note that there is no CTCAE Grade 1 category for pancreatitis or Grade 4 category for fatigue or PPES. 
Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications were used by 88% of subjects in each arm. Antipropulsives (eg, loperamide) 
were taken as concomitant medications by more than 3 times as many cabozantinib subjects as 
sunitinib subjects (28% vs 8%). In addition, more than twice as many cabozantinib subjects received 
thyroid hormones compared with sunitinib subjects (28% vs 11%). This complies with the observed 
safety profile of cabozantinib.

study treatment). This subject is discussed in greater detail in Section 12.3.4.2.7. 
b Events of embolism from the Exelixis cabozantinib global safety database included pulmonary embolism, stroke, 
thrombosis of the axillary artery, or thrombosis of the left internal carotid artery; further information on these AEs 
is provided in Sections 12.3.4.2.4 and 12.3.4.2.5. In addition, there was one uncoded Grade 3 AE described as a 
‘pulmonary embolism’ reported in the cabozantinib arm.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Per protocol, adverse events that met the definition of serious, based on the Investigator’s 
assessment, were to be flagged as “expedited” on the CRF and were to be submitted directly to NCI-
CTEP by the investigators. All events flagged as “expedited” on the CRFs were assumed by Exelixis to 
be SAEs as were all Grade 5 AEs. However, per Alliance procedures, events flagged as “expedited” in 
the clinical data base and those reported to NCI-CTEP were not reconciled. Safety review by NCI-CTEP 
and Exelixis determined that not all “expedited” events met seriousness criteria. As a result, events 
identified as “expedited” included non-serious events leading to a potential over-reporting of the 
incidence of SAEs.

Table 34:  
Grade 5 Adverse Events with Death Dates Through 30 Days after the Last dose 
of study treatment 
Among subjects with Grade 5 AEs that started through 30 days after last dose of study treatment, six 
experienced events assessed as treatment related; these subjects comprised two in the cabozantinib 
arm (acute renal failure and sepsis) and four in the sunitinib arm (sepsis, angiopathy, respiratory 
failure, and sudden death). 
Three subjects who died before 30 days after last dose did not have corresponding Grade 5 AEs 
reported in the clinical database: one cabozantinib subject (cause of death: tumour [ie, disease 
progression]) and two sunitinib subjects (causes of death: complete atelectasis, respiratory 
insufficiency and accident). The cabozantinib subject had a jejunal mass eroding adjacent bowel and 
experienced an AE of jejunal perforation initially reported as Grade 4 severity in the clinical database; 
however, follow-up reporting included in the safety narrative but not the clinical database indicates 
that the Investigator later re-assessed the cause of death as jejunal perforation (Grade 5 AE related to 
study treatment). 
Grade 5 AEs that started more than 30 days after the last dose of study treatment included one Grade 
5 AE of respiratory failure in each treatment arm. The other Grade 5 AEs that started more than 30 
days after the last dose of study treatment were reported in one subject each, both in the sunitinib 
arm. None of these Grade 5 AEs were assessed as related to study treatment 
Events To Monitor (ETMs) 
Exelixis has defined a set of Events to Monitor (ETMs) for cabozantinib to track events known to be 
associated with TKIs or VEGF pathway inhibition (Ravaud 2011, Eisen et al 2012), may have 
potentially serious consequences, or were determined to warrant ongoing routine surveillance. These 
comprise gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, fistula, abscess – all, intra-abdominal and pelvic abscess, 
≥ Grade 3 haemorrhage, venous and mixed thrombotic events (VTEs), arterial thrombotic events 
(ATEs), wound complications, hypertension, osteonecrosis, PPES, proteinuria, reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES), diarrhoea, and QT prolongation. 
As shown in Table 37, there was a higher incidence of all grades diarrhoea, hypertension, PPES and 
embolism in the cabozantinib arm than in the sunitinib arm. The incidence of Grade 3 diarrhoea was 
similar in each arm (cabozantinib 10%, sunitinib 11%) and there were no Grade 4 diarrhoea in either

treatment arm. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hypertension in the cabozantinib arm 
(28% vs 21%); however, there was no Grade 4 hypertension in the cabozantinib arm whereas one 
subject in the sunitinib arm had a Grade 4 AE. There was also a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 
pulmonary embolism in the cabozantinib arm (9.0% vs 0%; see below), including two subjects with a 
Grade 4 AE. Two subjects had GI perforations in the cabozantinib arm while there were none in the 
sunitinib arm.

not collected, nor was outcome, start date, or stop date. Based on subject disposition, 21% of subjects 
in the cabozantinib arm and 22% in the sunitinib arm discontinued study treatment due to an AE (not 
excluding events of disease progression) in the Safety population.

Post marketing experience 
Cabozantinib capsules (Cometriq) were first approved by the FDA on 29 November 2012 for the 
treatment of patients with progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) at a dose of 140 mg 
qd. Cometriq was made commercially available in the United States on 24 January 2013. On 21 March 
2014, cabozantinib capsules (Cometriq) at the 140 mg dose received approval through the centralized 
procedure by the European Commission for the treatment of adults with progressive, unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic MTC. Cabozantinib tablets (Cabometyx) were approved by the FDA on 
25 April 2016 for patients with advanced RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy and by 
the European Commission on 09 September 2016 for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults 
following prior VEGF-targeted therapy.  
The post-marketing patient population for cabozantinib (Cabometyx and Cometriq combined) through 
28 November 2016 comprised 4325 total patients exposed including 3693 in the US, 586 in the EU 
(221 marketed, 365 named patient use [NPU] and managed access program), and 46 from other 
countries (NPU). Through 28 November 2016, patients in the US marketed setting have received 
cabozantinib for treatment of RCC (n=1255) and thyroid cancer (n=1952) as well as malignancies 
other than the approved indication, including prostate, lung, and hepatocellular cancer. In the EU, 
information on treated indication is not available.  
Cumulatively, 1126 serious adverse reactions (SARs) have been reported in the postmarketing setting 
for Cabometyx (165 SARs in 115 patients) and Cometriq (961 SARs in 507 patients) through 28 
November 2016. Postmarketing SARs reported in patients who received Cabometyx through 28 
November 2016: 
• 
In 105 patients who received Cabometyx on-label for the indication of renal cancer (including RCC, 
metastatic RCC, and renal cancer), 151 postmarketing SARs were received. The most frequent 
non-fatal SARs (excluding events of hospitalization) included thrombosis (n=7), pneumonia (n=4), 
diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting (each n=3). These most frequently reported SARs are generally 
consistent with the known Cabometyx safety profile. Similarly, in 10 patients who received 
Cabometyx for off-label indications, the SARs reported are also generally consistent with the 
known Cabometyx safety profile.  
Postmarketing SARs reported in patients who received Cometriq through 28 November 2016:  
• 
In 224 patients who received Cometriq on-label for the indication of thyroid cancer (including 
thyroid cancer, MTC, thyroid neoplasm, thyroid cancer metastatic, and thyroid disorder), 474 
postmarketing SARs were received. The most frequent non-fatal SAR reported in more than 5 
patients included dehydration (n=27), diarrhoea (n=16), pneumonia (n=13), asthenia, vomiting 
(each n=11), weight decreased, hypertension (each n=8), dyspnoea (n=7), pancreatitis, loss of 
consciousness, hypotension, pulmonary embolism, and confusional state (each n=6). These most 
frequently reported SARs are generally consistent with the known Cometriq safety profile. 
•  A total of 283 patients received Cometriq off-label, of which 128 patients received Cometriq for the 
indication of renal cancer (including RCC and malignant neoplasm of the renal pelvis or urinary 
tract). The 128 patients who received Cometriq for the indication of renal cancer experienced 192 
post-marketing SARs. The most frequent nonfatal SARs included dehydration, pneumonia (each 
n=8), diarrhoea (n=4), hypertension, vomiting, urinary tract infection, rectal haemorrhage, 
pulmonary embolism, pain, thrombosis, cerebrovascular accident, diarrhoea, and infection (each 
n=3); the observed frequency of these SARs is generally consistent with the known Cometriq 
safety profile.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure 
The median duration of exposure was longer in the cabozantinib arm, with 10 cabozantinib subjects 
still on treatment at cut-off versus 2 in the sunitinib arm.  Some differences between the study arms 
might be the result of the longer duration of exposure in the cabozantinib arm compared with the 
sunitinib arm.  
Adverse events  
Overall, the incidence of AEs was similar between treatment arms (cabozantinib arm 96%, sunitinib 
arm 99%).  
The AEs observed with cabozantinib treatment in Study A031203 are in line with the known safety 
profile of cabozantinib and there were no new safety signals. However, there was a higher incidence in 
Study A031203 than METEOR of the following cabozantinib AEs of any grade (≥ 10% difference): 
hypertension (67%, 37%), dysgeusia (41%, 24%), stomatitis (37%, 22%), dyspepsia (27%, 12%) 
and dizziness (22%, 11%), and embolism (12%, 0.3%)/ 
The incidences of laboratory-associated AEs were generally similar to the corresponding METEOR 
laboratory abnormalities, reflecting the difference in collection of safety parameters between the two 
studies.  
Comparing Grade 3 /4 AEs between the studies, there are smaller differences in the incidences of the 
individual AEs. However, there is clearly a higher reporting of Grade 3 /4 hypertension (28%,15%) and 
embolism (7.7%, 0%) in Study A031203 than in METEOR. 
A plausible explanation for the lower rate of hypertension in the METEOR study is that patients in the 
METEOR study had previously received more treatment for hypertension than patients in study 
A031203 because they had received a prior VEGFR-TKI. Hypertension was a solicited AE in study 
A031203, which may also have contributed to a higher reporting of this AE compared to the METEOR 
study.  
The higher incidence of embolism in Study A031203 relative to METEOR may be an artefact of 
differences in reporting of thromboembolic events in the two studies. In METEOR, thromboembolic 
events were generally assigned more specific PTs that could be categorized as arterial (eg, myocardial 
infarction or stroke) or venous thrombotic events (eg, pulmonary embolism or DVT). In contrast, no 
further specification was used on Study A031203, and thromboembolic events were generally reported 
as the PT embolism. In METEOR, the incidence of venous and mixed/unspecified thrombotic ETMs 
(Events to Monitor) was 7.3% (24 subjects), of which 12/24 had event of grade 3 or 4.  
For both hypertension and thromboembolic events, sufficient warnings are already included in the 
SmPC, section 4.4. 
For the remainder of the AEs, the applicant has pointed to the differences in the patient populations as 
a possible explanation, i.e. subjects in Study A031203 were treatment-naive and may have been more 
prone to reporting non-serious AEs than the pre-treated subjects in METEOR. Furthermore, differences 
in reporting AEs can also explain the higher frequency of adverse events in study A031203 compare to 
METEOR study. 
Most of the observed AEs are considered treatment related. There are some differences between the 
two treatments with regards to type of treatment related adverse events most frequently reported, 
Assessment report  
EMA/235286/2018 
Page 67/80 
 
 
  
e.g. there are more liver enzyme elevations in the cabozantinib arm, while blood counts are more 
often affected in the sunitinib arm. 
The overall perception is that the number of treatment related AEs is higher in the cabozantinib arm 
compared to the sunitinib arm. This could be explained by the longer exposure in the cabozantinib arm 
compared to the sunitinib arm.  
doses modifications (reduction and interruption) 
Dose data were collected on the CRF by treatment cycle and not by date; thus information on study 
treatment modifications is limited. There were less dose reductions with cabozantinib in the current 
study compared to the METEOR study. In the METEOR study, dose reductions and dose interruptions 
occurred in 60% and 70% patients, respectively (versus 46% and 73% in the cabozantinib arm for this 
study), with diarrhoea, PPES and fatigue as the most common causes.  
The applicant has updated the SmPC section 4.4 with the additional frequencies of dose reductions and 
interruptions from Study A031203. 
Grade 3/4 AEs 
A similar incidence of Grade 3/4 AEs was observed across treatment arms  (68% and 65%), while 
there were more subjects with Grade 4 AEs in the cabozantinib arm than the sunitinib arm (10% vs 
6.9%) 
The most common solicited Grade 3/4 AEs were hypertension, diarrhoea, PPES and fatigue in both 
treatment arms. The Grade 3/4 AE with the largest difference in incidence between the treatment 
arms, is fatigue (all Grade 3), with 17% in the sunitinib arm and 6.4% in the cabozantinib arm. Grade 
3/4 embolism was reported in 6 patients (7.7%) in the cabozantinib arm. Two of them were Grade 4. 
There were none in the sunitinib arm.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
The overall incidence of SAEs regardless of causality was similar in both treatment arms (49% 
cabozantinib, 51% sunitinib). The overall incidence of treatment-related SAEs was similar in both 
treatment arms (36% each). 
The overall incidence of SAEs of any grade was 49% in the cabozantinib arm of Study A031203 and 
40% in the cabozantinib arm of the METEOR study. The fact that SAEs may have been over-reported in 
Study A031203 compare to the METEOR study could explained the difference in overall incidence. In 
addition, there is some uncertainty in the detected frequencies in study A031203 due to the rather 
small sample size.  
Deaths 
There were more deaths reported as Grade 5 AEs in the sunitinib arm, both before and after 30 days 
after last dose of study treatment. There were more deaths in the sunitinib arm through 30 days after 
last dose compared to the cabozantinib arm, 8.3% and 3.8%, respectively.  
There were 3 deaths in the cabozantinib arm which were considered related to the treatment; one case 
of jejunal perforation, one sepsis and one acute renal failure. For the sepsis case, it was considered 
secondary to the large intestinal perforation which is a known adverse reaction for cabozantinib. 
Therefore sepsis has not been shown to be causally related to cabozantinib at this time. 
In the sunitinib arm, deaths considered related to the treatment consisted of one patient who died 
from angiopathy, one sepsis, one sudden death, and one respiratory failure.   
Assessment report  
EMA/235286/2018 
Page 68/80 
 
 
  
 
The overall incidence of Grade 5 AEs through 30 days after last dose was similar in the cabozantinib 
arm of Study A031203 and the METEOR study, 3.8% and 4.5%, respectively. 
Events to monitor 
There were in general more all grades and Grade 3/4 AEs in the cabozantinib arm compared to the 
sunitinib arm among the ETMs. 
Safety in special population 
No conclusions could be drawn regarding the effects of sex, race or weight as few subjects were 
female, non-White or weighed < 60 kg. There were higher incidences in the cabozantinib arm with 
increasing age of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (AST), and 
hypocalcemia (Table 38). However, there were no Grade 4 AEs of hypocalcemia in any cabozantinib-
treated subject.  
In the METEOR study, there were no marked clinically important differences in safety noted for age, 
gender, baseline weight and ECOG performance status although as few subjects were non-White no 
meaningful conclusions could be drawn regarding the effect of race. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Similar proportions of patients in the two study arms discontinued due to AEs (not excluding events of 
disease progression). The reason for discontinuation has not routinely been captured and very little 
information is available. In the METEOR study, the incidence of treatment discontinuations due to AEs 
(excluding AEs related to disease progression) in the cabozantinib arm was 9.7%. The most frequent 
AEs that led to treatment discontinuation were decreased appetite (1.8%) and fatigue (1.2%). It is of 
concern that so little is known about the cause of discontinuation.  
Finally no new safety findings have been identified in the post marketing experience.  
No changes were proposed to the list of safety concerns of the Risk management plan as a result of 
data coming from the study supporting the new indication or data coming from post maketing 
experience. 
The section 4.8 of the SmPC was revised to include data in treatment-naïve renal cell carcinoma. Since 
most of the adverse reactions are the same for both indications, a single table listing all adverse 
actions observed for both indications was included with the with the principle of using the higher 
frequency when the same adverse reactions have been reported with different frequencies between the 
2 indications. 
The main differences were also highlighted in the section “description of selected adverse reactions” 
below the table. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, there seems to be more AEs with cabozantinib compared to sunitinib. This could be explained 
by the longer exposure in the cabozantinib arm compared to the sunitinib arm. Similar proportions of 
patients in the two study arms discontinued due to AEs which could indicate that the safety profile of 
the products are equally acceptable. There were no new safety signals compared to experience with 
cabozantinib in the METEOR study. However, there were clearly more of some AEs compared to the 
METEOR study. This might be due to differences in study populations and treatment duration. Overall, 
the safety profile for cabozantinib seems acceptable.

Carcinogenicity 
In line with the RMP guidance introduced by GVP V rev 2, the following important identified risks were 
removed from the RMP: hypertension, diarrhoea, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, 
hypothyroidism, and proteinuria. Removal of these important identified risks is accepted as no 
additional pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation activities are in place and these risks are sufficiently 
characterized and addressed in the current Product information. Furthermore, the assessment of the 
information regarding those important identified risks in the previous PSURs did not show any 
significant changes in the safety profile. 
In addition, the MAH proposed to remove the following important potential risks: QT prolongation, 
fertility impairment and medication error.  
-QT prolongation was removed since no medically meaningful QT prolongation was observed in renal 
cell carcinoma patients. Also, no cases of Torsade de Pointes and grade 3,4, or 5 events were 
identified. In the latest PSUR (DLP 28 November 2016) it is described that in the post-marketing 
phase,  no cases of QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes were observed. Currently, in SmPC section 
4.4 it is described that cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT 
interval prolongation, patients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing 
cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances. Based on the information provided, it is 
accepted to remove QT prolongation.

-Fertility impairment was removed as it has limited influence on the benefit-risk balance and it is 
sufficiently covered in the SmPC.   
- Risk of medication errors was removed as no cases were identified in the post marketing phase.

The table of risk minimisations measures was adjusted to reflect the change in the list of safety 
concerns (deletion/reclassification of safety concerns due to revision of GVP module V and RMP 
template). 
Having considered the data submitted, the proposed risk minimisation measures remain sufficient to 
minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indications. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. In addition, the marketing authorisation holder took the opportunity to make some editorial 
changes in the product information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable as the changes introduced 
in the PL as part of this variation application do not have a relevant impact on the readability of the PL. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH applied for the following extension of the indication for CABOMETYX: 
CABOMETYX is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in treatment-naïve 
adults with intermediate or poor risk per IMDC criteria.  
The aim of the therapy is to prolong progression free survival and overall survival. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of renal cell carcinoma (2016) 
presents an algorithm for systemic treatment in mRCC with a clear cell component. According to the 
algorithm, sunitinib is the recommended first-line treatment of clear cell RCC for patients with good or 
Assessment report  
EMA/235286/2018 
Page 74/80 
 
 
  
 
intermediate risk, while temsirolimus is the first choice in patients with poor risk, however, with 
sunitinib as a “reasonable alternative”. In addition to immunotherapy, several TKIs and 
temsirolimus/everolimus are recommended as second and further lines of therapy.  
The vast majority of patients with advanced RCC will experience disease progression due to acquired 
or a priori resistance to VEGFR- or mTOR-targeted therapy. The median overall survival for patients 
with advanced RCC ranges from about 8 months (poor risk score) to 4 years (favourable risk score). 
Therefore, an unmet need remains for treatments that will prolong time to progression and improve 
survival. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The safety and efficacy of CABOMETYX for the treatment of treatment-naïve renal cell carcinoma were 
evaluated in a randomized, open-label, multicenter study (CABOSUN). Patients (N=157) with 
previously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic RCC with a clear cell component were randomized 
(1:1) to receive CABOMETYX (N=79) or sunitinib (N=78). Patients had to have intermediate or poor 
risk disease as defined by the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group 
categories. Patients were stratified by IMDC risk group and presence of bone metastases (yes/no). 
Approximately 75% of patients had a nephrectomy prior to onset of treatment. The primary endpoint 
was PFS. Secondary efficacy endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). 
Tumor assessments were conducted every 12 weeks. 
The study was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program 
(CTEP) and conducted by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (the Alliance). The primary and 
secondary endpoints of Study A031203 were originally analysed by the Alliance and reported in the 
literature18,19. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
PFS determined by the IRC using FDA-recommended censoring rules showed a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS for subjects in the cabozantinib arm compared with the sunitinib arm. The HR 
adjusted for stratification factors was 0.48 (95% CI 0.31, 0.74; p = 0.0008). The median duration of 
PFS was estimated to be 8.6 months in the cabozantinib arm vs 5.3 months in the sunitinib arm. PFS 
was determined by the IRC using analyses as per EMA censoring rules. The median PFS was the same 
with a HR=0.48 (95%CI 0.32, 0.73; p=0.0005). 
Subgroup analyses of PFS in patients according to IMDC risk intermediate (N=127) and poor (N=30), 
resulted in HRs of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.82) and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.92) in the two groups, 
respectively. 
The results of the Investigator analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for 
subjects in the cabozantinib arm compared with the sunitinib arm, much in line with the IRC analysis.  
CABOMETYX treatment was associated with a trend for longer survival compared to sunitinib. The 
study was not powered for the OS analysis and the data are immature. The Kaplan-Meier estimates for 
median duration of OS were 30.3 months (95% CI: 14.6, NE) in the cabozantinib arm vs 21.0 months 
(95% CI: 16.3, 27.0) in the sunitinib arm. HR adjusted for stratification factors was 0.74 (95% CI 
0.47, 1.14) with a p-value = 0.1700; i.e. not statistically significant. More recently, the Alliance 
presented OS results at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual meeting in 
September 2017, based on an analysis they conducted with a data cut-off of 01 July 201719. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/235286/2018 
Page 75/80 
 
 
  
analysis includes 7 more deaths. The result of this analysis is similar to the two previous analyses, with 
a HR of 0.80, 95% CI (0.53, 1.21), p=0.2885.  
The IRC-determined ORR was 20% (95% CI 12.0, 30.8) in the cabozantinib arm, compared with 9% 
(95% CI 3.7, 17.6) in the sunitinib arm (p=0.0406). 
Patients with both positive and negative MET status showed a favourable effect with CABOMETYX 
compared to sunitinib, with greater activity in patients with a positive MET status compared to patients 
with a negative MET status (HR=0.32 (0.16, 0.63) vs 0.67 (0.37, 1.23)) respectively (see SmPC 
section 5.1).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although more than 50% of the patients have had an OS event overall, less than half of the patients in 
the cabozantinib arm have died. Thus, there is a notable degree of censoring around the median 
estimates in the OS analysis. Considering that PFS analyses showed an approximately 3 months 
improvement with cabozantinib compared with sunitinib, the median OS gain of 9 months seems 
overestimated. In addition, none of the OS analyses shows statistically significant improvement in OS. 
Therefore, no definitive conclusion can be drawn from the OS data. However, despite some crossing of 
the curves, it can be concluded that cabozantinib does not appear to have a detrimental effect on OS. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the incidence of AEs was similar between treatment arms (cabozantinib arm 96%, sunitinib 
arm 99%). A similar incidence of Grade 3/4 AEs was observed across treatment arms  (68% and 
65%), while there were more subjects with Grade 4 AEs in the cabozantinib arm than the sunitinib arm 
(10% vs 6.9%). There were more deaths reported as Grade 5 AEs in the sunitinib arm, both before 
and after 30 days after last dose of study treatment. 
Common AEs regardless of study drug relationship:  
The most frequent AEs (≥ 20% of subjects) in the cabozantinib arm in descending order of frequency 
were diarrhoea (73%), hypertension (67%), fatigue (64%), AST increased (60%), ALT increased 
(55%), decreased appetite (47%), PPES (42%), dysgeusia (41%), platelet count decreased (38%), 
stomatitis (37%), anaemia (33%), nausea (32%), weight decreased (32%), dyspepsia (27%), blood 
creatinine increased (24%), hypophosphatemia (23%), hypothyroidism (23%), vomiting (23%), 
dizziness (22%), dysphonia (22%), hypomagnesemia (22%), and hyperglycaemia (21%). The 
summary of the safety profile in the SmPC section 4.8 has been updated. 
The most common Grade 3/4 AEs (≥ 5% of subjects) in the cabozantinib arm were hypertension, 
diarrhoea, PPES, fatigue, ALT increased, hyponatraemia, hypophosphataemia, embolism, decreased 
appetite, hypotension, pain, stomatitis, and syncope. The Grade 3/4 AE with the largest difference in 
incidence between the treatment arms and the only one with more than 10% difference, is fatigue (all 
Grade 3), with 17% in the sunitinib arm and 6.4% in the cabozantinib arm.  
SAEs: 
The number of subjects with at least one SAE was similar in both treatment arms (49% cabozantinib, 
51% sunitinib). The most frequent SAE PTs (≥ 5% of subjects) in the cabozantinib arm in descending 
order of frequency were hypertension (9.0%), embolism (9.0%), diarrhoea (5.1%), PPES (5.1%) and 
acute renal failure (5.1%). The most frequent SAE PTs (≥ 5% of subjects) in the sunitinib arm in 
Assessment report  
EMA/235286/2018 
Page 76/80 
 
 
  
descending order of frequency were diarrhoea (6.9%), fatigue (5.6%), nausea (5.6%) and vomiting 
(5.6%). The majority of these SAEs were considered treatment related. 
On-treatment deaths: 
There were more deaths in the sunitinib arm through 30 days after last dose compared to the 
cabozantinib arm, 8.3% (6/72) and 3.8% (3/78), respectively. The 3 deaths in the cabozantinib arm 
were considered related to the treatment; one case of jejunal perforation, one sepsis and one acute 
renal failure. In the sunitinib arm, deaths considered related to the treatment consisted of one patient 
who died from angiopathy, one sepsis, one sudden death, and one respiratory failure.   
Discontinuations: 
Not excluding events of disease progression, 21% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm and 22% in the 
sunitinib arm discontinued study treatment due to an AE.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There were no new safety concerns that have been raised in this application. However, there were only 
15 patients in each arm that were in the poor risk category and hence, the safety database is small for 
this patient population. In general, there was a higher incidence in Study A031203 than the METEOR 
study of the following cabozantinib AEs of any grade (≥ 10% difference): hypertension (67%, 37%), 
dysgeusia (41%, 24%), stomatitis (37%, 22%), dyspepsia (27%, 12%) dizziness (22%, 11%), and 
embolism (12%, 0.3%). There is clearly a higher reporting of Grade 3/4 hypertension (28%, 15%) and 
embolism (7.7%, 0%) in Study A031203 than in METEOR. In addition, more patients discontinued due 
to AEs of cabozantinib than in the METEOR study, 21% (not excluding events of disease progression) 
and 9.7% (excluding events of disease progression), respectively. The reason for discontinuation in 
Study A031203 was not routinely captured and very little information is available if discontinuation is 
due to the tolerability of cabozantinib. However, a similar number of patients in the two treatment 
arms of Study A31202 discontinued due to AEs, reassuring that the tolerability is not worse than 
sunitinib. Further safety data will be gathered during post-authorisation and as part of routine 
pharmacovigilance, guided questionnaires have been developed for identified risks of gastrointestinal 
(GI) perforation, GI and non-GI fistula, arterial thromboembolic events, haemorrhage, RPLS and 
osteonecrosis. The next PSUR for cabozantinib will include a cumulative review of literature and post-
marketing data for the risks for which follow-up questionnaires are in place.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A statistically significant improvement in PFS as retrospectively assessed by a blinded Independent 
Radiology Committee (IRC) was demonstrated for CABOMETYX compared to sunitinib. Study A031203 
provided a 3 months improvement in PFS which is of clinical relevance as it is expected to delay next-
line therapy and may potentially also result in an improvement in overall survival since in previously 
treated RCC (METEOR study), there seems to be a correlation between improved PFS and OS. The ORR 
was also higher in the cabozantinib arm relative to sunitinib. The results from the Investigator 
determined analysis and IRC-determined analysis of PFS were consistent. 
The safety profile of cabozantinib observed in Study A031203 is similar to the safety profile that is 
already known, although hypertension, dysgeusia, stomatitis, dyspepsia and dizziness were reported 
much more frequently compared to the METEOR study. While a similar number of patients in the two 
treatment arms of Study A31202 discontinued due to AEs, there were more AEs in the cabozantinib 
arm compared with the sunitinib arm. This may be due to patients in the cabozantinib arm being 
treated for a longer time. Thus, the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib is acceptable and 
manageable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The CHMP considers that the benefits in terms of PFS outweigh the risks in the agreed indication in 
treatment-naïve adults with intermediate or poor risk disease (see SmPC section 5.1).  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Treatment-naïve patients with advanced RCC of IMDC Intermediate and Poor risk have a poor 
prognosis. An unmet need remains for treatments that will prolong time to progression and improve 
survival. The study A031203 has shown that cabozantinib can improve PFS compared to sunitinib, 
which is the current standard of care for treatment-naïve patients. It is expected that a prolonged PFS 
could result in an improvement in OS, although no firm conclusion can be drawn from the currently 
submitted data. As no information has been provided for patients with favourable risks, the CHMP has 
restricted the indication for the patient population that has been well described in the study. Hence, 
the indication is restricted to treatment-naïve patients with IMDC intermediate risk disease, where one 
or two of the following risk factors were met, and poor risk, where three or more factors were met: 
time from diagnosis of RCC to systemic treatment < 1 year, Hgb < LLN, Corrected calcium > ULN, KPS 
< 80%, Neutrophil count > ULN and Platelet count > ULN (see Section 5.1 of the SmPC).  
Approximately 40% of subjects in each arm had MET-positive disease. MET upregulation is associated 
with poor pathologic features and unfavourable prognosis in RCC patients. The superiority of 
cabozantinib over sunitinib for this patient subgroup may reflect cabozantinib’s mechanism of action, 
that includes inhibition not only of VEGFR but also of MET and AXL. This is reflected in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of CABOMETYX is positive.

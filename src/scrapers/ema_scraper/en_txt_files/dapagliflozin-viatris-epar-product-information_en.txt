Heart failure 
Dapagliflozin Viatris is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction. 
Chronic kidney disease 
Dapagliflozin Viatris is indicated in adults for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
The recommended dose is 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily. 
When dapagliflozin is used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, such as a 
sulphonylurea, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be considered to reduce the risk of 
hypoglycaemia (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Heart failure 
The recommended dose is 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily. 
In the DAPA-HF study, dapagliflozin was administered in conjunction with other heart failure 
therapies (see section 5.1). 
Chronic kidney disease 
The recommended dose is 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily. 
In the DAPA-CKD study, dapagliflozin was administered in conjunction with other chronic kidney 
disease therapies (see section 5.1). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required based on renal function. 
Due to limited experience, it is not recommended to initiate treatment with dapagliflozin in patients 
with GFR < 25 mL/min. 
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the glucose lowering efficacy of dapagliflozin is reduced 
when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is < 45 mL/min and is likely absent in patients with severe 
renal impairment. Therefore, if GFR falls below 45 mL/min, additional glucose lowering treatment 
should be considered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus if further glycaemic control is needed 
(see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In patients 
with severe hepatic impairment, a starting dose of 5 mg is recommended. If well tolerated, the dose 
may be increased to 10 mg (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
No dose adjustment is recommended based on age. 
Paediatric population 
No dose adjustment is required for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children aged 10 years 
and above (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). No data are available for children below 10 years of age.

The safety and efficacy of Dapagliflozin Viatris for the treatment of heart failure or for the treatment 
of chronic kidney disease in children < 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Dapagliflozin Viatris can be taken orally once daily at any time of day with or without food. Tablets 
are to be swallowed whole. The tablet cannot be divided into equal doses. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Renal impairment 
Due to limited experience, it is not recommended to initiate treatment with dapagliflozin in patients 
with GFR < 25 mL/min. 
The glucose lowering efficacy of dapagliflozin is dependent on renal function, and is reduced in 
patients with GFR < 45 mL/min and is likely absent in patients with severe renal impairment (see 
sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2). 
In one study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderate renal impairment (GFR 
< 60 mL/min), a higher proportion of patients treated with dapagliflozin had adverse reactions of 
increase in creatinine, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypotension, compared with 
placebo. 
Hepatic impairment 
There is limited experience in clinical studies in patients with hepatic impairment. Dapagliflozin 
exposure is increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Use in patients at risk for volume depletion and/or hypotension 
Due to its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin increases diuresis which may lead to the modest 
decrease in blood pressure observed in clinical studies (see section 5.1). It may be more pronounced in 
patients with very high blood glucose concentrations. 
Caution should be exercised in patients for whom a dapagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure 
could pose a risk, such as patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension or 
elderly patients. 
In case of intercurrent conditions that may lead to volume depletion (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), 
careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, 
laboratory tests including haematocrit and electrolytes) is recommended. Temporary interruption of 
treatment with dapagliflozin is recommended for patients who develop volume depletion until the 
depletion is corrected (see section 4.8). 
Diabetic ketoacidosis 
Rare cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been 
reported in patients treated with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including 
dapagliflozin. In a number of cases, the presentation of the condition was atypical with only 
moderately increased blood glucose values, below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as 
nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual 
fatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms 
occur, regardless of blood glucose level. 
In patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, dapagliflozin treatment should be stopped 
immediately. 
Treatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute 
serious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of 
blood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with dapagliflozin may be restarted when the 
ketone values are normal and the patient’s condition has stabilised. 
Before initiating dapagliflozin, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis should 
be considered. 
Patients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g. 
type 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or 
patients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or 
severe dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin 
requirements due to acute medical illness, surgery or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used 
with caution in these patients. 
Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients experiencing a DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor 
treatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved. In 
type 1 diabetes mellitus studies with dapagliflozin, DKA was reported with common frequency. 
Dapagliflozin should not be used for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. 
Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene) 
Post-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier’s gangrene) have 
been reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors (see section 4.8). This is a rare but 
serious and potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic 
treatment. 
Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of 
pain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware 
that either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier’s 
gangrene is suspected, dapagliflozin should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including 
antibiotics and surgical debridement) should be instituted. 
Urinary tract infections 
Urinary glucose excretion may be associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection; 
therefore, temporary interruption of dapagliflozin should be considered when treating pyelonephritis 
or urosepsis. 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
Elderly patients may be at a greater risk for volume depletion and are more likely to be treated with 
diuretics. 
Elderly patients are more likely to have impaired renal function, and/or to be treated with 
anti-hypertensive medicinal products that may cause changes in renal function such as 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB). 
The same recommendations for renal function apply to elderly patients as to all patients (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cardiac failure 
Experience with dapagliflozin in NYHA class IV is limited. 
Chronic kidney disease 
There is no experience with dapagliflozin for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in patients 
without diabetes who do not have albuminuria. Patients with albuminuria may benefit more from 
treatment with dapagliflozin. 
Lower limb amputations 
An increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in long-term, 
clinical studies in type 2 diabetes mellitus with SGLT2 inhibitors. It is unknown whether this 
constitutes a class effect. It is important to counsel patients with diabetes on routine preventative foot 
care. 
Urine laboratory assessments 
Due to its mechanism of action, patients taking Dapagliflozin Viatris will test positive for glucose in 
their urine. 
Dapagliflozin Viatris contains Lactose 
The tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Dapagliflozin Viatris contains sodium. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Diuretics 
Dapagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of 
dehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4). 
Insulin and insulin secretagogues 
Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower 
dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when 
used in combination with dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see sections 4.2 
and 4.8). 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
The metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily via glucuronide conjugation mediated by UDP 
glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9). 
In in vitro studies, dapagliflozin neither inhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. 
Therefore, dapagliflozin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of co-administered medicinal 
products that are metabolised by these enzymes. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect of other medicinal products on dapagliflozin 
Dapagliflozin may increase renal lithium excretion and the blood lithium levels may be decreased. 
Serum concentration of lithium should be monitored more frequently after dapagliflozin initiation and 
dose changes. Please refer the patient to the lithium prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum 
concentration of lithium. 
Interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single-dose design, suggest that the 
pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin are not altered by metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, 
voglibose, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, or simvastatin. 
Following co-administration of dapagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of various active transporters 
and drug-metabolising enzymes) a 22% decrease in dapagliflozin systemic exposure (AUC) was 
observed, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24-hour urinary glucose excretion. No dose 
adjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, phenobarbital) is not expected. 
Following co-administration of dapagliflozin with mefenamic acid (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 55% 
increase in dapagliflozin systemic exposure was seen, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 
24-hour urinary glucose excretion. No dose adjustment is recommended. 
Effect of dapagliflozin on other medicinal products 
In interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single-dose design, dapagliflozin 
did not alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, 
hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, digoxin (a P-gp substrate) or warfarin (S-warfarin, a 
CYP2C9 substrate), or the anticoagulatory effects of warfarin as measured by INR. Combination of a 
single dose of dapagliflozin 20 mg and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) resulted in a 19% increase in 
AUC of simvastatin and 31% increase in AUC of simvastatin acid. The increase in simvastatin and 
simvastatin acid exposures are not considered clinically relevant. 
Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay 
Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are 
unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use of alternative 
methods to monitor glycaemic control is advised. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of dapagliflozin in pregnant women. Studies in rats have shown 
toxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third trimesters of 
human pregnancy (see section 5.3). Therefore, the use of dapagliflozin is not recommended during the 
second and third trimesters of pregnancy. 
When pregnancy is detected, treatment with dapagliflozin should be discontinued. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether dapagliflozin and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of dapagliflozin/metabolites in 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
milk, as well as pharmacologically-mediated effects in nursing offspring (see section 5.3). A risk to 
the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Dapagliflozin should not be used while breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
The effect of dapagliflozin on fertility in humans has not been studied. In male and female rats, 
dapagliflozin showed no effects on fertility at any dose tested. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Dapagliflozin Viatris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients 
should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when dapagliflozin is used in combination with a 
sulphonylurea or insulin. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
In the clinical studies in type 2 diabetes, more than 15 000 patients have been treated with 
dapagliflozin. 
The primary assessment of safety and tolerability was conducted in a pre-specified pooled analysis of 
13 short-term (up to 24 weeks) placebo-controlled studies with 2 360 subjects treated with 
dapagliflozin 10 mg and 2 295 treated with placebo. 
In the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DECLARE study, see 
section 5.1), 8 574 patients received dapagliflozin 10 mg and 8 569 received placebo for a median 
exposure time of 48 months. In total, there were 30 623 patient-years of exposure to dapagliflozin. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions across the clinical studies were genital infections. 
Heart failure 
In the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcome study in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction (DAPA-HF study), 2 368 patients were treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and 2 368 patients 
with placebo for a median exposure time of 18 months. The patient population included patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus and without diabetes, and patients with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
The overall safety profile of dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure was consistent with the known 
safety profile of dapagliflozin. 
Chronic kidney disease 
In the dapagliflozin renal outcome study in patients with chronic kidney disease (DAPA-CKD), 
2 149 patients were treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and 2 149 patients with placebo for a median 
exposure time of 27 months. The patient population included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
without diabetes, with eGFR ≥ 25 to ≤ 75 mL/min/1.73 m2, and albuminuria (urine albumin creatinine 
ratio [UACR] ≥ 200 and ≤ 5000 mg/g). Treatment was continued if eGFR fell to levels below 
25 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
The overall safety profile of dapagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease was consistent with 
the known safety profile of dapagliflozin.

subjects and ≥ 0.1% more and at least 3 more subjects treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared to placebo. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Vulvovaginitis, balanitis and related genital infections 
In the 13-study safety pool, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and related genital infections were reported in 
5.5% and 0.6% of subjects who received dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. Most 
infections were mild to moderate, and subjects responded to an initial course of standard treatment and 
rarely resulted in discontinuation from dapagliflozin treatment. These infections were more frequent in 
females (8.4% and 1.2% for dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively), and subjects with a prior history 
were more likely to have a recurrent infection. 
In the DECLARE study, the numbers of patients with serious adverse events of genital infections were 
few and balanced: 2 patients in each of the dapagliflozin and placebo groups. 
In the DAPA-HF study, no patient reported serious adverse events of genital infections in the 
dapagliflozin group and one in the placebo group. There were 7 (0.3%) patients with adverse events 
leading to discontinuations due to genital infections in the dapagliflozin group and none in the placebo 
group. 
In the DAPA-CKD study, there were 3 (0.1%) patients with serious adverse events of genital 
infections in the dapagliflozin group and none in the placebo group. There were 3 (0.1%) patients with 
adverse events leading to discontinuation due to genital infections in the dapagliflozin group and none 
in the placebo group. Serious adverse events of genital infections or adverse events leading to 
discontinuation due to genital infections were not reported for any patients without diabetes. 
Cases of phimosis/acquired phimosis have been reported concurrent with genital infections and in 
some cases, circumcision was required. 
Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene) 
Cases of Fournier’s gangrene have been reported post-marketing in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors, 
including dapagliflozin (see section 4.4). 
In the DECLARE study with 17 160 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and a median exposure time of 
48 months, a total of 6 cases of Fournier’s gangrene were reported, one in the dapagliflozin-treated 
group and 5 in the placebo group. 
Hypoglycaemia 
The frequency of hypoglycaemia depended on the type of background therapy used in the clinical 
studies in diabetes mellitus. 
For studies of dapagliflozin in monotherapy, as add-on to metformin or as add-on to sitagliptin (with 
or without metformin), the frequency of minor episodes of hypoglycaemia was similar (< 5%) 
between treatment groups, including placebo up to 102 weeks of treatment. Across all studies, major 
events of hypoglycaemia were uncommon and comparable between the groups treated with 
dapagliflozin or placebo. Studies with add-on sulphonylurea and add-on insulin therapies had higher 
rates of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.5). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In an add-on to glimepiride study, at weeks 24 and 48, minor episodes of hypoglycaemia were 
reported more frequently in the group treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus glimepiride (6.0% and 
7.9%, respectively) than in the placebo plus glimepiride group (2.1% and 2.1%, respectively). 
In an add-on to insulin study, episodes of major hypoglycaemia were reported in 0.5% and 1.0% of 
subjects treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus insulin at weeks 24 and 104, respectively, and in 0.5% 
of subjects treated with placebo plus insulin groups at weeks 24 and 104. At weeks 24 and 104, minor 
episodes of hypoglycaemia were reported, respectively, in 40.3% and 53.1% of subjects who received 
dapagliflozin 10 mg plus insulin and in 34.0% and 41.6% of the subjects who received placebo plus 
insulin. 
In an add-on to metformin and a sulphonylurea study, up to 24 weeks, no episodes of major 
hypoglycaemia were reported. Minor episodes of hypoglycaemia were reported in 12.8% of subjects 
who received dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin and a sulphonylurea and in 3.7% of subjects who 
received placebo plus metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
In the DECLARE study, no increased risk of major hypoglycaemia was observed with dapagliflozin 
therapy compared with placebo. Major events of hypoglycaemia were reported in 58 (0.7%) patients 
treated with dapagliflozin and 83 (1.0%) patients treated with placebo. 
In the DAPA-HF study, major events of hypoglycaemia were reported in 4 (0.2%) patients in both the 
dapagliflozin and placebo treatment groups and observed only in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. 
In the DAPA-CKD study, major events of hypoglycaemia were reported in 14 (0.7%) patients in the 
dapagliflozin group and 28 (1.3%) patients in the placebo group and observed only in patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Volume depletion 
In the 13-study safety pool, reactions suggestive of volume depletion (including, reports of 
dehydration, hypovolaemia or hypotension) were reported in 1.1% and 0.7% of subjects who received 
dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively; serious reactions occurred in < 0.2% of subjects 
balanced between dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo (see section 4.4). 
In the DECLARE study, the numbers of patients with events suggestive of volume depletion were 
balanced between treatment groups: 213 (2.5%) and 207 (2.4%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo 
groups, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in 81 (0.9%) and 70 (0.8%) in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo group, respectively. Events were generally balanced between treatment 
groups across subgroups of age, diuretic use, blood pressure and angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitors (ACE-I)/angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) use. In patients with eGFR 
< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline, there were 19 events of serious adverse events suggestive of volume 
depletion in the dapagliflozin group and 13 events in the placebo group. 
In the DAPA-HF study, the numbers of patients with events suggestive of volume depletion were 170 
(7.2%) in the dapagliflozin group and 153 (6.5%) in the placebo group. There were fewer patients with 
serious events of symptoms suggestive of volume depletion in the dapagliflozin group (23 [1.0%]) 
compared with the placebo group (38 [1.6%]). Results were similar irrespective of presence of 
diabetes at baseline and baseline eGFR. 
In the DAPA-CKD study, the numbers of patients with events suggestive of volume depletion were 
120 (5.6%) in the dapagliflozin group and 84 (3.9%) in the placebo group. There were 16 (0.7%) 
patients with serious events of symptoms suggestive of volume depletion in the dapagliflozin group 
and 15 (0.7%) patients in the placebo group. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus 
In the DECLARE study, with a median exposure time of 48 months, events of DKA were reported in 
27 patients in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients in the placebo group. The events occurred 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
evenly distributed over the study period. Of the 27 patients with DKA events in the dapagliflozin 
group, 22 had concomitant insulin treatment at the time of the event. Precipitating factors for DKA 
were as expected in a type 2 diabetes mellitus population (see section 4.4). 
In the DAPA-HF study, events of DKA were reported in 3 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the 
dapagliflozin group and none in the placebo group. 
In the DAPA-CKD study, events of DKA were not reported in any patient in the dapagliflozin group 
and in 2 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the placebo group. 
Urinary tract infections 
In the 13-study safety pool, urinary tract infections were more frequently reported for dapagliflozin 
10 mg compared to placebo (4.7% versus 3.5%, respectively; see section 4.4). Most infections were 
mild to moderate, and subjects responded to an initial course of standard treatment and rarely resulted 
in discontinuation from dapagliflozin treatment. These infections were more frequent in females, and 
subjects with a prior history were more likely to have a recurrent infection. 
In the DECLARE study, serious events of urinary tract infections were reported less frequently for 
dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo, 79 (0.9%) events versus 109 (1.3%) events, respectively. 
In the DAPA-HF study, the numbers of patients with serious adverse events of urinary tract infections 
were 14 (0.6%) in the dapagliflozin group and 17 (0.7%) in the placebo group. There were 5 (0.2%) 
patients with adverse events leading to discontinuations due to urinary tract infections in each of the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups. 
In the DAPA-CKD study, the numbers of patients with serious adverse events of urinary tract 
infections were 29 (1.3%) in the dapagliflozin group and 18 (0.8%) in the placebo group. There were 8 
(0.4%) patients with adverse events leading to discontinuations due to urinary tract infections in the 
dapagliflozin group and 3 (0.1%) in the placebo group. The numbers of patients without diabetes 
reporting serious adverse events of urinary tract infections or adverse events leading to discontinuation 
due to urinary tract infections were similar between treatment groups (6 [0.9%] versus 4 [0.6%] for 
serious adverse events, and 1 [0.1%] versus 0 for adverse events leading to discontinuation, in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively). 
Increased creatinine 
Adverse reactions related to increased creatinine were grouped (e.g. decreased renal creatinine 
clearance, renal impairment, increased blood creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration rate). In 
the 13-study safety pool, this grouping of reactions was reported in 3.2% and 1.8% of patients who 
received dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. In patients with normal renal function or mild 
renal impairment (baseline eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) this grouping of reactions were reported in 
1.3% and 0.8% of patients who received dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. These 
reactions were more common in patients with baseline eGFR ≥ 30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (18.5% 
dapagliflozin 10 mg versus 9.3% placebo). 
Further evaluation of patients who had renal-related adverse events showed that most had serum 
creatinine changes of ≤ 0.5 mg/dL from baseline. The increases in creatinine were generally transient 
during continuous treatment or reversible after discontinuation of treatment. 
In the DECLARE study, including elderly patients and patients with renal impairment (eGFR less than 
60 mL/min/1.73 m2), eGFR decreased over time in both treatment groups. At 1 year, mean eGFR was 
slightly lower, and at 4 years, mean eGFR was slightly higher in the dapagliflozin group compared 
with the placebo group. 
In the DAPA-HF study, eGFR decreased over time in both the dapagliflozin group and the placebo 
group. The initial decrease in mean eGFR was -4.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the dapagliflozin group and -
1.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo group. At 20 months, change from baseline in eGFR was 13 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar between the treatment groups: -5.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 for dapagliflozin and -4.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 
for placebo. 
In the DAPA-CKD study, eGFR decreased over time in both the dapagliflozin group and the placebo 
group. The initial (day 14) decrease in mean eGFR was -4.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the dapagliflozin 
group and -0.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo group. At 28 months, change from baseline in eGFR 
was -7.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the dapagliflozin group and -8.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo group. 
Paediatric population 
The dapagliflozin safety profile observed in a clinical study in children aged 10 years and above with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (see section 5.1) was similar to that observed in the studies in adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Dapagliflozin did not show any toxicity in healthy subjects at single oral doses up to 500 mg (50 times 
the maximum recommended human dose). These subjects had detectable glucose in the urine for a 
dose-related period of time (at least 5 days for the 500 mg dose), with no reports of dehydration, 
hypotension or electrolyte imbalance, and with no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval. The 
incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar to placebo. In clinical studies where once-daily doses of up to 
100 mg (10 times the maximum recommended human dose) were administered for 2 weeks in healthy 
subjects and type 2 diabetes subjects, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was slightly higher than placebo 
and was not dose-related. Rates of adverse events including dehydration or hypotension were similar 
to placebo, and there were no clinically meaningful dose-related changes in laboratory parameters, 
including serum electrolytes and biomarkers of renal function. 
In the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the 
patient’s clinical status. The removal of dapagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors, ATC code: A10BK01 
Mechanism of action 
Dapagliflozin is a highly potent (Ki: 0.55 nM), selective and reversible inhibitor of SGLT2. Inhibition 
of SGLT2 by dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate in the 
proximal renal tubule with a concomitant reduction in sodium reabsorption leading to urinary 
excretion of glucose and osmotic diuresis. Dapagliflozin therefore increases the delivery of sodium to 
the distal tubule which increases tubuloglomerular feedback and reduces intraglomerular pressure. 
This combined with osmotic diuresis leads to a reduction in volume overload, reduced blood pressure, 
and lower preload and afterload, which may have beneficial effects on cardiac remodelling and 
preserve renal function. Other effects include an increase in haematocrit and reduction in body weight. 
The cardiac and renal benefits of dapagliflozin are not solely dependent on the blood glucose-lowering 
effect and not limited to patients with diabetes as demonstrated in the DAPA-HF and DAPA-CKD 
studies. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dapagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels by reducing renal glucose 
reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. This glucose excretion (glucuretic effect) is 
observed after the first dose, is continuous over the 24-hour dosing interval and is sustained for the 
duration of treatment. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this mechanism is 
dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and GFR. Thus, in subjects with normal blood 
glucose, dapagliflozin has a low propensity to cause hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin does not impair 
normal endogenous glucose production in response to hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin acts 
independently of insulin secretion and insulin action. Improvement in homeostasis model assessment 
for beta cell function (HOMA beta-cell) has been observed in clinical studies with dapagliflozin. 
The SGLT2 is selectively expressed in the kidney. Dapagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose 
transporters important for glucose transport into peripheral tissues and is > 1 400 times more selective 
for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, the major transporter in the gut responsible for glucose absorption. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in 
subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Approximately 
70 g of glucose was excreted in the urine per day (corresponding to 280 kcal/day) at a dapagliflozin 
dose of 10 mg/day in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks. Evidence of sustained 
glucose excretion was seen in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus given dapagliflozin 10 mg/day for 
up to 2 years. 
This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in osmotic diuresis and increases in 
urinary volume in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary volume increases in subjects with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg were sustained at 12 weeks and amounted to 
approximately 375 mL/day. The increase in urinary volume was associated with a small and transient 
increase in urinary sodium excretion that was not associated with changes in serum sodium 
concentrations. 
Urinary uric acid excretion was also increased transiently (for 3-7 days) and accompanied by a 
sustained reduction in serum uric acid concentration. At 24 weeks, reductions in serum uric acid 
concentrations ranged from -48.3 to -18.3 micromoles/L (-0.87 to -0.33 mg/dL). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Improvement of glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality 
are integral parts of the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
Fourteen double-blind, randomised, controlled clinical studies were conducted with 7 056 adult 
subjects with type 2 diabetes to evaluate the glycaemic efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin; 4 737 
subjects in these studies were treated with dapagliflozin. Twelve studies had a treatment period of 
24 weeks duration, 8 with long-term extensions ranging from 24 to 80 weeks (up to a total study 
duration of 104 weeks), one study had a 28-week treatment period, and one study was 52 weeks in 
duration with long-term extensions of 52 and 104 weeks (total study duration of 208 weeks). Mean 
duration of diabetes ranged from 1.4 to 16.9 years. Fifty percent (50%) had mild renal impairment and 
11% had moderate renal impairment. Fifty-one percent (51%) of the subjects were men, 84% were 
White, 8% were Asian, 4% were Black and 4% were of other racial groups. Eighty-one percent (81%) 
of the subjects had a body mass index (BMI)  27. Furthermore, two 12-week, placebo-controlled 
studies were conducted in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. 
A cardiovascular outcomes study (DECLARE) was conducted with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared 
with placebo in 17 160 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without established 
cardiovascular disease to evaluate the effect on cardiovascular and renal events.

Glycaemic control 
Monotherapy 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 24-week duration (with an additional extension period) 
was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of monotherapy with dapagliflozin in subjects with 
inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Once-daily treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in 
statistically significant (p < 0.0001) reductions in HbA1c compared to placebo (Table 2). 
In the extension period, HbA1c reductions were sustained through week 102 (-0.61%, and -0.17% 
adjusted mean change from baseline for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively).

Add-on combination therapy 
In a 52-week, active-controlled non-inferiority study (with 52- and 104-week extension periods), 
dapagliflozin was evaluated as add-on therapy to metformin compared with a sulphonylurea 
(glipizide) as add-on therapy to metformin in subjects with inadequate glycaemic control 
(HbA1c > 6.5% and ≤ 10%). The results showed a similar mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline to 
week 52, compared to glipizide, thus demonstrating non-inferiority (Table 3). At week 104, adjusted 
mean change from baseline in HbA1c was -0.32% for dapagliflozin and -0.14% for glipizide. At week 
208, adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c was -0.10% for dapagliflozin and 0.20% for 
glipizide. At 52, 104 and 208 weeks, a significantly lower proportion of subjects in the group treated 
with dapagliflozin (3.5%, 4.3% and 5.0%, respectively) experienced at least one event of 
hypoglycaemia compared to the group treated with glipizide (40.8%, 47.0% and 50.0%, respectively). 
The proportion of subjects remaining in the study at week 104 and week 208 was 56.2% and 39.7% 
for the group treated with dapagliflozin and 50.0% and 34.6% for the group treated with glipizide.

Dapagliflozin as an add-on with either metformin, glimepiride, metformin and a sulphonylurea, 
sitagliptin (with or without metformin) or insulin resulted in statistically significant reductions in 
HbA1c at 24 weeks compared with subjects receiving placebo (p < 0.0001; Tables 4, 5 and 6). 
The reductions in HbA1c observed at week 24 were sustained in add-on combination studies 
(glimepiride and insulin) with 48-week data (glimepiride) and up to 104-week data (insulin). At week 
48 when added to sitagliptin (with or without metformin), the adjusted mean change from baseline for 
dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo was -0.30% and 0.38%, respectively. For the add-on to metformin 
study, HbA1c reductions were sustained through week 102 (-0.78% and 0.02% adjusted mean change 
from baseline for 10 mg and placebo, respectively). At week 104 for insulin (with or without 
additional oral glucose-lowering medicinal products), the HbA1c reductions were -0.71% and -0.06% 
adjusted mean change from baseline for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. At weeks 48 
and 104, the insulin dose remained stable compared to baseline in subjects treated with dapagliflozin 
10 mg at an average dose of 76 IU/day. In the placebo group there was a mean increase of 10.5 IU/day 
and 18.3 IU/day from baseline (mean average dose of 84 and 92 IU/day) at weeks 48 and 104, 
respectively. The proportion of subjects remaining in the study at week 104 was 72.4% for the group 
treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and 54.8% for the placebo group.

sulphonylurea therapy, and the rest were on other oral glucose-lowering medicinal products. 
In combination with metformin in drug-naive patients 
A total of 1 236 drug-naive patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and 
≤ 12%) participated in two active-controlled studies of 24 weeks duration to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of dapagliflozin (5 mg or 10 mg) in combination with metformin in drug-naive patients versus 
therapy with the monocomponents. 
Treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg in combination with metformin (up to 2000 mg per day) provided 
significant improvements in HbA1c compared to the individual components (Table 7), and led to 
greater reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (compared to the individual components) and body 
weight (compared to metformin).

Combination therapy with prolonged-release exenatide 
In a 28-week, double-blind, active comparator-controlled study, the combination of dapagliflozin and 
prolonged-release exenatide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) was compared to dapagliflozin alone and 
prolonged-release exenatide alone in subjects with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone 
(HbA1c ≥ 8% and ≤ 2%). All treatment groups had a reduction in HbA1c compared to baseline. The 
combination treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide group showed 
superior reductions in HbA1c from baseline compared to dapagliflozin alone and prolonged-release 
exenatide alone (Table 8).

Fasting plasma glucose 
Treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg as a monotherapy or as an add-on to either metformin, 
glimepiride, metformin and a sulphonylurea, sitagliptin (with or without metformin) or insulin resulted 
in statistically significant reductions in FPG (-1.90 to -1.20 mmol/L [-34.2 to -21.7 mg/dL]) compared 
to placebo (-0.33 to 0.21 mmol/L [-6.0 to 3.8 mg/dL]). This effect was observed at week 1 of treatment 
and maintained in studies extended through week 104. 
Combination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significantly 
greater reductions in FPG at week 28: -3.66 mmol/L (-65.8 mg/dL), compared to -2.73 mmol/L (-
49.2 mg/dL) for dapagliflozin alone (p < 0.001) and -2.54 mmol/L (-45.8 mg/dL) for exenatide alone 
(p < 0.001). 
In a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR ≥ 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, treatment with 
dapagliflozin demonstrated reductions in FPG at week 24: -1.19 mmol/L (-21.46 mg/dL) compared to 
-0.27 mmol/L (-4.87 mg/dL) for placebo (p=0.001). 
Post-prandial glucose 
Treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg as an add-on to glimepiride resulted in statistically significant 
reductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose at 24 weeks that were maintained up to week 48. Treatment 
with dapagliflozin 10 mg as an add-on to sitagliptin (with or without metformin) resulted in reductions 
in 2-hour post-prandial glucose at 24 weeks that were maintained up to week 48. Combination therapy 
of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significantly greater reductions in 
2-hour post-prandial glucose at week 28 compared to either medicinal product alone. 
Body weight 
Dapagliflozin 10 mg as an add-on to metformin, glimepiride, metformin and a sulphonylurea, 
sitagliptin (with or without metformin) or insulin resulted in statistically significant body weight 
reduction at 24 weeks (p < 0.0001, Tables 4 and 5). These effects were sustained in longer-term 
studies. At 48 weeks, the difference for dapagliflozin as add-on to sitagliptin (with or without 
metformin) compared with placebo was -2.22 kg. At 102 weeks, the difference for dapagliflozin as 
add-on to metformin compared with placebo, or as add-on to insulin compared with placebo was -2.14 
and -2.88 kg, respectively. 
As an add-on therapy to metformin in an active-controlled non-inferiority study, dapagliflozin resulted 
in a statistically significant body weight reduction compared with glipizide of -4.65 kg at 52 weeks 
(p < 0.0001, Table 3) that was sustained at 104 and 208 weeks (-5.06 kg and –4.38 kg, respectively). 
The combination of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide demonstrated significantly 
greater weight reductions compared to either medicinal product alone (Table 8). 
A 24-week study in 182 diabetic subjects using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to evaluate 
body composition demonstrated reductions with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin compared with 
placebo plus metformin, respectively, in body weight and body fat mass as measured by DXA rather 
than lean tissue or fluid loss. Treatment with dapagliflozin plus metformin showed a numerical 
decrease in visceral adipose tissue compared with placebo plus metformin treatment in a magnetic 
resonance imaging substudy. 
Blood pressure 
In a pre-specified pooled analysis of 13 placebo-controlled studies, treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg 
resulted in a systolic blood pressure change from baseline of –3.7 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 
of –1.8 mmHg versus –0.5 mmHg systolic and -0.5 mmHg diastolic blood pressure for placebo group 
at week 24. Similar reductions were observed up to 104 weeks. 
Combination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in a 
significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure at week 28 (-4.3 mmHg) compared to 
dapagliflozin alone (-1.8 mmHg, p < 0.05) and prolonged-release exenatide alone (-1.2 mmHg, 
p < 0.01).

In two 12-week, placebo-controlled studies a total of 1 062 patients with inadequately controlled type 
2 diabetes and hypertension (despite pre-existing stable treatment with an ACE-I or ARB in one study 
and an ACE-I or ARB plus one additional antihypertensive treatment in another study) were treated 
with dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. At week 12 for both studies, dapagliflozin 10 mg plus usual 
antidiabetic treatment provided improvement in HbA1c and decreased the placebo-corrected systolic 
blood pressure on average by 3.1 and 4.3 mmHg, respectively. 
In a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR ≥ 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, treatment with 
dapagliflozin demonstrated reductions in seated systolic blood pressure at week 24: -4.8 mmHg 
compared to -1.7 mmHg for placebo (p < 0.05). 
Glycaemic control in patients with moderate renal impairment CKD 3A (eGFR ≥ 45 to 
< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
The efficacy of dapagliflozin was assessed in a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR ≥ 45 
to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 who had inadequate glycaemic control on usual care. Treatment with 
dapagliflozin resulted in reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared with placebo (Table 9).

Patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 9% 
In a pre-specified analysis of subjects with baseline HbA1c ≥ 9.0%, treatment with dapagliflozin 
10 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c at week 24 as a monotherapy (adjusted 
mean change from baseline: -2.04% and 0.19% for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively) and 
as an add-on to metformin (adjusted mean change from baseline: -1.32% and -0.53% for dapagliflozin 
and placebo, respectively). 
Cardiovascular and renal outcomes 
Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE) was an international, multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study conducted to determine the effect of 
dapagliflozin compared with placebo on cardiovascular outcomes when added to current background 
therapy. All patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus and either at least two additional cardiovascular risk 
factors (age ≥ 55 years in men or ≥ 60 years in women and one or more of dyslipidaemia, hypertension 
or current tobacco use) or established cardiovascular disease. 
Of 17 160 randomised patients, 6 974 (40.6%) had established cardiovascular disease and 10 186 
(59.4%) did not have established cardiovascular disease. 8 582 patients were randomised to 
dapagliflozin 10 mg and 8 578 to placebo, and were followed for a median of 4.2 years. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean age of the study population was 63.9 years, 37.4% were female. In total, 22.4% had had 
diabetes for ≤ 5 years, mean duration of diabetes was 11.9 years. Mean HbA1c was 8.3% and mean 
BMI was 32.1 kg/m2. 
At baseline, 10.0% of patients had a history of heart failure. Mean eGFR was 85.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, 
7.4% of patients had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 30.3% of patients had micro- or 
macroalbuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 to ≤ 300 mg/g or > 300 mg/g, respectively). 
Most patients (98%) used one or more diabetic medicinal products at baseline, including metformin 
(82%), insulin (41%) and sulfonylurea (43%). 
The primary endpoints were time to first event of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial 
infarction or ischaemic stroke (MACE) and time to first event of the composite of hospitalisation for 
heart failure or cardiovascular death. The secondary endpoints were a renal composite endpoint and 
all-cause mortality. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events 
Dapagliflozin 10 mg demonstrated non-inferiority versus placebo for the composite of cardiovascular 
death, myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke (one-sided p < 0.001). 
Heart failure or cardiovascular death 
Dapagliflozin 10 mg demonstrated superiority versus placebo in preventing the composite of 
hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death (Figure 1). The difference in treatment effect 
was driven by hospitalisation for heart failure, with no difference in cardiovascular death (Figure 2). 
The treatment benefit of dapagliflozin over placebo was observed both in patients with and without 
established cardiovascular disease, with and without heart failure at baseline, and was consistent 
across key subgroups, including age, gender, renal function (eGFR) and region.

CI=confidence interval. 
Nephropathy 
Dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of events of the composite of confirmed sustained eGFR 
decrease, end-stage kidney disease, renal or cardiovascular death. The difference between groups was 
driven by reductions in events of the renal components; sustained eGFR decrease, end-stage kidney 
disease and renal death (Figure 2). 
The hazard ratio (HR) for time to nephropathy (sustained eGFR decrease, end-stage kidney disease 
and renal death) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.43, 0.66) for dapagliflozin versus placebo. 
In addition, dapagliflozin reduced the new onset of sustained albuminuria (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.72, 
0.87]) and led to greater regression of macroalbuminuria (HR 1.82 [95% CI 1.51, 2.20]) compared 
with placebo. 
Heart failure 
Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) was an international, 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with heart failure (New 
York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular 
ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤ 40%) to determine the effect of dapagliflozin compared with placebo, 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
when added to background standard of care therapy, on the incidence of cardiovascular death and 
worsening heart failure. 
Of 4 744 patients, 2 373 were randomised to dapagliflozin 10 mg and 2 371 to placebo and followed 
for a median of 18 months. The mean age of the study population was 66 years, 77% were male. 
At baseline, 67.5% of the patients were classified as NYHA class II, 31.6% class III and 0.9% class 
IV, median LVEF was 32%, 56% of the heart failures were ischaemic, 36% were non-ischaemic and 
8% were of unknown aetiology. In each treatment group, 42% of the patients had a history of type 2 
diabetes mellitus, and an additional 3% of the patients in each group were classified as having type 2 
diabetes mellitus based on a HbA1c ≥ 6.5% at both enrolment and randomisation. Patients were on 
standard of care therapy; 94% of patients were treated with ACE-I, ARB or angiotensin receptor 
neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI, 11%), 96% with beta-blocker, 71% with mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonist (MRA), 93% with diuretic and 26% had an implantable device (with defibrillator function). 
Patients with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at enrolment were included in the study. The mean eGFR 
was 66 mL/min/1.73 m2, 41% of patients had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 15% had 
eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
Cardiovascular death and worsening heart failure 
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in preventing the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular 
death, hospitalisation for heart failure or urgent heart failure visit (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.65, 0.85], 
p < 0.0001). The effect was observed early and was sustained throughout the duration of the study 
(Figure 3).

An urgent heart failure visit was defined as an urgent, unplanned, assessment by a physician, e.g. in an Emergency 
Department, and requiring treatment for worsening heart failure (other than just an increase in oral diuretics). 
The number of first events for the single components are the actual number of first events for each component and does not 
add up to the number of events in the composite endpoint. 
Event rates are presented as the number of subjects with event per 100 patient years of follow-up. 
p-values for single components and all-cause mortality are nominal. 
Dapagliflozin also reduced the total number of events of hospitalisations for heart failure (first and 
recurrent) and cardiovascular death; there were 567 events in the dapagliflozin group versus 742 
events in the placebo group (Rate Ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.65, 0.88]; p=0.0002). 
The treatment benefit of dapagliflozin was observed in heart failure patients both with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and without diabetes. Dapagliflozin reduced the primary composite endpoint of incidence of 
cardiovascular death and worsening heart failure with a HR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.63, 0.90) in patients 
with diabetes and 0.73 (95% CI 0.60, 0.88) in patients without diabetes. 
The treatment benefit of dapagliflozin over placebo on the primary endpoint was also consistent across 
other key subgroups, including concomitant heart failure therapy, renal function (eGFR), age, gender, 
and region. 
Patient reported outcome – heart failure symptoms 
The treatment effect of dapagliflozin on heart failure symptoms was assessed by the Total Symptom 
Score of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-TSS), which quantifies heart failure 
symptom frequency and severity, including fatigue, peripheral oedema, dyspnoea and orthopnoea. The 
score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better health status. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit 
over placebo in heart failure symptoms, as measured by change from baseline at Month 8 in the 
KCCQ-TSS, (Win Ratio 1.18 [95% CI 1.11, 1.26]; p < 0.0001). Both symptom frequency and 
symptom burden contributed to the results. Benefit was seen both in improving heart failure symptoms 
and in preventing deterioration of heart failure symptoms. 
In responder analyses, the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful improvement on the 
KCCQ-TSS from baseline at 8 months, defined as 5 points or more, was higher for the dapagliflozin 
treatment group compared with placebo. The proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful 
deterioration, defined as 5 points or more, was lower for the dapagliflozin treatment group compared 
to placebo. The benefits observed with dapagliflozin remained when applying more conservative cut-
offs for larger clinically meaningful change (Table 10).

Nephropathy 
There were few events of the renal composite endpoint (confirmed sustained ≥ 50% eGFR decrease, 
ESKD, or renal death); the incidence was 1.2% in the dapagliflozin group and 1.6% in the placebo 
group. 
Chronic kidney disease 
The Study to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in 
Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) was an international, multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with eGFR ≥ 25 
to ≤ 75 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria (UACR ≥ 200 and ≤ 5000 mg/g) to determine the effect of 
dapagliflozin compared with placebo, when added to background standard of care therapy, on the 
incidence of the composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease 
(ESKD) (defined as sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, chronic dialysis treatment or receiving a 
renal transplant), cardiovascular or renal death. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of 4 304 patients, 2 152 were randomised to dapagliflozin 10 mg and 2 152 to placebo and followed 
for a median of 28.5 months. Treatment was continued if eGFR fell to levels below 
25 mL/min/1.73 m2 during the study and could be continued in cases when dialysis was needed. 
The mean age of the study population was 61.8 years, 66.9% were male. At baseline, mean eGFR was 
43.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 and median UACR was 949.3 mg/g, 44.1% of patients had eGFR 30 to 
< 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 14.5% had eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. 67.5% of the patients had type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Patients were on standard of care (SOC) therapy; 97.0% of patients were treated 
with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). 
The study was stopped early for efficacy prior to the planned analysis based on a recommendation by 
the independent Data Monitoring Committee. Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in preventing the 
primary composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, reaching end-stage kidney disease, 
cardiovascular or renal death. Based on the Kaplan-Meier plot for the time to first occurrence of the 
primary composite endpoint, the treatment effect was evident beginning at 4 months and was 
maintained through the end of study (Figure 5).

Months from Randomisation 
All four components of the primary composite endpoint individually contributed to the treatment 
effect. Dapagliflozin also reduced the incidence of the composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline 
in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease or renal death and the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death 
and hospitalisation for heart failure. Treatment with dapagliflozin improved overall survival in chronic 
kidney disease patients with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (Figure 6).

The number of first events for the single components are the actual number of first events for each component and does not 
add up to the number of events in the composite endpoint. 
Event rates are presented as the number of subjects with event per 100 patient years of follow-up. 
Hazard ratio estimates are not presented for subgroups with less than 15 events in total, both arms combined. 
The treatment benefit of dapagliflozin was consistent in chronic kidney disease patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus and without diabetes. Dapagliflozin reduced the primary composite endpoint 
of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, reaching end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular or renal death 
with a HR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.52, 0.79) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 0.50 (95% CI 0.35, 
0.72) in patients without diabetes. 
The treatment benefit of dapagliflozin over placebo on the primary endpoint was also consistent across 
other key subgroups, including eGFR, age, gender, and region. 
29 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
In a clinical study in children and adolescents aged 10-24 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
39 patients were randomised to dapagliflozin 10 mg and 33 to placebo, as add-on to metformin, insulin 
or a combination of metformin and insulin. At randomisation, 74% of the patients were < 18 years of 
age. The adjusted mean change in HbA1c for dapagliflozin relative to placebo from baseline to week 
24 was -0.75% (95% CI -1.65, 0.15). In the age group < 18 years the adjusted mean change in HbA1c 
for dapagliflozin relative to placebo was -0.59% (95% CI -1.66, 0.48). In the age group ≥ 18 years, the 
mean change from baseline in HbA1c was -1.52% in the dapagliflozin treated group (n=9) and 0.17% 
in the placebo treated group (n=6). Efficacy and safety were similar to that observed in the adult 
population treated with dapagliflozin. Safety and tolerability were further confirmed in a 28-week 
safety extension of the study. 
Heart failure and chronic kidney disease 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
dapagliflozin in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of cardiovascular events in 
patients with chronic heart failure and in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Dapagliflozin was rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration. Maximum dapagliflozin plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) were usually attained within 2 hours after administration in the fasted state. 
Geometric mean steady-state dapagliflozin Cmax and AUCτ values following once daily 10 mg doses of 
dapagliflozin were 158 ng/mL and 628 ng h/mL, respectively. The absolute oral bioavailability of 
dapagliflozin following the administration of a 10 mg dose is 78%. Administration with a high-fat 
meal decreased dapagliflozin Cmax by up to 50% and prolonged Tmax by approximately 1 hour, but did 
not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. These changes are not considered to be clinically 
meaningful. Hence, this medicine can be administered with or without food. 
Distribution 
Dapagliflozin is approximately 91% protein bound. Protein binding was not altered in various disease 
states (e.g. renal or hepatic impairment). The mean steady-state volume of distribution of dapagliflozin 
was 118 litres. 
Biotransformation 
Dapagliflozin is extensively metabolised, primarily to yield dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is 
an inactive metabolite. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide or other metabolites do not contribute to the 
glucose-lowering effects. The formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is mediated by UGT1A9, an 
enzyme present in the liver and kidney, and CYP-mediated metabolism was a minor clearance 
pathway in humans. 
Elimination 
The mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) for dapagliflozin was 12.9 hours following a single oral dose 
of dapagliflozin 10 mg to healthy subjects. The mean total systemic clearance of dapagliflozin 
administered intravenously was 207 mL/min. Dapagliflozin and related metabolites are primarily 
eliminated via urinary excretion with less than 2% as unchanged dapagliflozin. After administration of 
a 50 mg [14C]-dapagliflozin dose, 96% was recovered, 75% in urine and 21% in faeces. In faeces, 
approximately 15% of the dose was excreted as parent drug. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linearity 
Dapagliflozin exposure increased proportional to the increment in dapagliflozin dose over the range of 
0.1 to 500 mg and its pharmacokinetics did not change with time upon repeated daily dosing for up to 
24 weeks. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
At steady-state (20 mg once-daily dapagliflozin for 7 days), subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (as determined by iohexol plasma clearance) had mean 
systemic exposures of dapagliflozin of 32%, 60% and 87% higher, respectively, than those of subjects 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. The steady-state 24-hour urinary glucose 
excretion was highly dependent on renal function and 85, 52, 18 and 11 g of glucose/day was excreted 
by subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function or mild, moderate or severe renal 
impairment, respectively. The impact of haemodialysis on dapagliflozin exposure is not known. The 
effect of reduced renal function on systemic exposure was evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic 
model. Consistent with previous results, model predicted AUC was higher in patients with chronic 
kidney disease compared with patients with normal renal function, and was not meaningfully different 
in chronic kidney disease patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without diabetes. 
Hepatic impairment 
In subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), mean Cmax and 
AUC of dapagliflozin were up to 12% and 36% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched 
control subjects. These differences were not considered to be clinically meaningful. In subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) mean Cmax and AUC of dapagliflozin were 40% and 
67% higher than matched healthy controls, respectively. 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
There is no clinically meaningful increase in exposure based on age alone in subjects up to 70 years 
old. However, an increased exposure due to age-related decrease in renal function can be expected. 
There are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding exposure in patients > 70 years old. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (glucosuria) in children with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 
10-17 years were similar to those observed in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Gender 
The mean dapagliflozin AUCss in females was estimated to be about 22% higher than in males. 
Race 
There were no clinically relevant differences in systemic exposures between White, Black or Asian 
races. 
Body weight 
Dapagliflozin exposure was found to decrease with increased weight. Consequently, low-weight 
patients may have somewhat increased exposure and patients with high weight somewhat decreased 
exposure. However, the differences in exposure were not considered clinically meaningful. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and fertility. Dapagliflozin 
did not induce tumours in either mice or rats at any of the doses evaluated in two-year carcinogenicity 
studies. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Direct administration of dapagliflozin to weanling juvenile rats and indirect exposure during late 
pregnancy (time periods corresponding to the second and third trimesters of pregnancy with respect to 
human renal maturation) and lactation are each associated with increased incidence and/or severity of 
renal pelvic and tubular dilatations in progeny. 
In a juvenile toxicity study, when dapagliflozin was dosed directly to young rats from postnatal day 21 
until postnatal day 90, renal pelvic and tubular dilatations were reported at all dose levels; pup 
exposures at the lowest dose tested were ≥ 15 times the maximum recommended human dose. These 
findings were associated with dose-related increases in kidney weight and macroscopic kidney 
enlargement observed at all doses. The renal pelvic and tubular dilatations observed in juvenile 
animals did not fully reverse within the approximate 1-month recovery period. 
In a separate study of pre- and postnatal development, maternal rats were dosed from gestation day 6 
through postnatal day 21, and pups were indirectly exposed in utero and throughout lactation. (A 
satellite study was conducted to assess dapagliflozin exposures in milk and pups.) Increased incidence 
or severity of renal pelvic dilatation was observed in adult offspring of treated dams, although only at 
the highest dose tested (associated maternal and pup dapagliflozin exposures were 1 415 times and 137 
times, respectively, the human values at the maximum recommended human dose). Additional 
developmental toxicity was limited to dose-related reductions in pup body weights, and observed only 
at doses ≥ 15 mg/kg/day (associated with pup exposures that are ≥ 29 times the human values at the 
maximum recommended human dose). Maternal toxicity was evident only at the highest dose tested, 
and limited to transient reductions in body weight and food consumption at dose. The no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) for developmental toxicity, the lowest dose tested, is associated with a 
maternal systemic exposure multiple that is approximately 19 times the human value at the maximum 
recommended human dose. 
In additional studies of embryo-foetal development in rats and rabbits, dapagliflozin was administered 
for intervals coinciding with the major periods of organogenesis in each species. Neither maternal nor 
developmental toxicities were observed in rabbits at any dose tested; the highest dose tested is 
associated with a systemic exposure multiple of approximately 1 191 times the maximum 
recommended human dose. In rats, dapagliflozin was neither embryolethal nor teratogenic at 
exposures up to 1 441 times the maximum recommended human dose.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Dapagliflozin Viatris is and what it is used for 
What Dapagliflozin Viatris is 
Dapagliflozin Viatris contains the active substance dapagliflozin. It belongs to a group of medicines 
called ‘sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors’. They work by blocking the SGLT2 
protein in your kidney. By blocking this protein, blood sugar (glucose), salt (sodium) and water are 
removed from your body via the urine. 
What Dapagliflozin Viatris is used for 
Dapagliflozin Viatris is used to treat: 
• 
• 
• 
Type 2 diabetes 
- 
- 
- 
- 
in adults and children aged 10 years and older. 
if your type 2 diabetes cannot be controlled with diet and exercise. 
Dapagliflozin Viatris can be used on its own or together with other medicines to treat 
diabetes. 
It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Heart failure 
- 
in adults (aged 18 years and older) with symptoms due to a weak pump function of the 
heart. 
Chronic kidney disease 
- 
in adults with reduced kidney function. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What is type 2 diabetes and how does Dapagliflozin Viatris help? 
• 
• 
In type 2 diabetes your body does not make enough insulin or is not able to use the insulin it 
makes properly. This leads to a high level of sugar in your blood. This can lead to serious 
problems like heart or kidney disease, blindness, and poor circulation in your arms and legs. 
Dapagliflozin Viatris works by removing excess sugar from your body. It can also help prevent 
heart disease. 
What is heart failure and how does Dapagliflozin Viatris help? 
• 
• 
• 
This type of heart failure occurs when the heart is weak and cannot pump enough blood to the 
lungs and the rest of the body. This can lead to serious medical problems and need for hospital 
care. 
The most common symptoms of heart failure are feeling breathless, feeling tired or very tired all 
the time, and ankle swelling. 
Dapagliflozin Viatris helps protect your heart from getting weaker and improves your 
symptoms. It can lower the need to go to hospital and can help some patients to live longer. 
What is chronic kidney disease and how does Dapagliflozin Viatris help? 
•  When you have chronic kidney disease, your kidneys may gradually lose their function. This 
means they would not be able to clean and filter your blood the way they should. Loss of kidney 
function can lead to serious medical problems and need for hospital care. 
Dapagliflozin Viatris helps protect your kidneys from losing their function. That can help some 
patients to live longer. 
• 
2.  What you need to know before you take Dapagliflozin Viatris 
Do not take Dapagliflozin Viatris 
• 
If you are allergic to dapagliflozin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away: 
Diabetic ketoacidosis 
• 
• 
• 
If you have diabetes and experience feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, 
fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, 
a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat or rapid 
weight loss. 
The above symptoms could be a sign of ‘diabetic ketoacidosis’ – a rare but serious, sometimes 
life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of ‘ketone 
bodies’ in your urine or blood, seen in tests. 
The risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive 
alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin 
due to major surgery or serious illness. 
•  When you are treated with Dapagliflozin Viatris, diabetic ketoacidosis can occur even if your 
blood sugar is normal. 
If you suspect you have diabetic ketoacidosis, contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away 
and do not take this medicine. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum 
• 
Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, 
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or 
feeling generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even 
lifethreatening infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier’s gangrene 
which destroys the tissue under the skin. Fournier’s gangrene has to be treated immediately. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Dapagliflozin Viatris: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you have ‘type 1 diabetes’ – the type that usually starts when you are young, and your body 
does not produce any insulin. 
If you have diabetes and have a kidney problem – your doctor may ask you to take additional 
or a different medicine to control your blood sugar. 
If you have a liver problem – your doctor may start you on a lower dose. 
If you are on medicines to lower your blood pressure (anti-hypertensives) and have a history 
of low blood pressure (hypotension). More information is given below under ‘Other medicines 
and Dapagliflozin Viatris’. 
If you have very high levels of sugar in your blood which may make you dehydrated (lose too 
much body fluid). Possible signs of dehydration are listed in section 4. Tell your doctor before 
you start taking this medicine if you have any of these signs. 
If you have or develop nausea (feeling sick), vomiting or fever or if you are not able to eat or 
drink. These conditions can cause dehydration. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking 
Dapagliflozin Viatris until you recover to prevent dehydration. 
If you often get infections of the urinary tract. 
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking Dapagliflozin Viatris. 
Diabetes and foot care 
If you have diabetes, it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice 
regarding foot care given by your health care professional. 
Urine glucose 
Because of how Dapagliflozin Viatris works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are on 
this medicine. 
Children and adolescents 
Dapagliflozin Viatris can be used in children aged 10 years and older for the treatment of type 2 
diabetes. No data are available in children below 10 years of age. 
Dapagliflozin Viatris is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age for the 
treatment of heart failure or for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, because it has not been 
studied in these patients. 
Other medicines and Dapagliflozin Viatris 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Especially tell your doctor: 
• 
• 
if you are taking a medicine used to remove water from the body (diuretic). 
if you are taking other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood such as insulin or 
a ‘sulphonylurea’ medicine. Your doctor may want to lower the dose of these other medicines, 
to prevent you from getting low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). 
if you are taking lithium because Dapagliflozin Viatris can lower the amount of lithium in your 
blood. 
• 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should stop taking this medicine 
if you become pregnant, since it is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. 
Talk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine. Do not use 
Dapagliflozin Viatris if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if this medicine passes into human 
breast milk. 
Driving and using machines 
Dapagliflozin Viatris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Taking this medicine with other medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause too low 
blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, sweating and 
change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Do not drive or use any tools or machines, if you feel dizzy taking Dapagliflozin Viatris.

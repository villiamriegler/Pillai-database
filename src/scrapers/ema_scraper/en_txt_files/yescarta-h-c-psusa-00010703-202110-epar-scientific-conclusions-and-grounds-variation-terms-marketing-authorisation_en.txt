Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for axicabtagene ciloleucel, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on status epilepticus from ongoing clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous 
reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship and in view of a plausible mechanism of 
action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between axicabtagene ciloleucel and status epilepticus 
is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products 
containing axicabtagene ciloleucel should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for axicabtagene ciloleucel the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing axicabtagene ciloleucel is unchanged 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

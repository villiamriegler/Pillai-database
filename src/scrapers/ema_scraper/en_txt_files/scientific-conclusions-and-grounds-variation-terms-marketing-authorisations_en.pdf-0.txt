Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for asciminib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on hypersensitivity from clinical trial(s) and managed access programs 
including in three cases a close temporal relationship, and in two cases double positive re-challenge and 
in view of hypersensitivity reactions being common for other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the PRAC 
considers that a causal relationship between asciminib and hypersensitivity is a reasonable possibility. 
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing asciminib should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for asciminib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing asciminib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

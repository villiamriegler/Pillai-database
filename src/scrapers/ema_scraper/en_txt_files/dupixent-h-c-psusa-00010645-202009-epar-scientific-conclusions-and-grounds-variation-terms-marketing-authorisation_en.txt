Scientific conclusions
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dupilumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on keratitis from clinical trials, literature, spontaneous reports including cases 
with close temporal relationship, positive re-challenge, the PRAC considers that a causal relationship 
between dupilumab and keratitis is a reasonable possibility at least in atopic dermatitis and asthma 
conditions. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dupilumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing dupilumab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Fabry disease is a rare, progressive X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, affecting both males and 
females, with an estimated prevalence of 1:117,000 up to 1:40,000 (Desnick and Schindler, 2001; 
Meikle et al., 1999; Eurordis, 2005). Mutations in the GLA gene result in a deficiency of the lysosomal 
enzyme, α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), which is required for glycosphingolipid metabolism (Brady, 
1967). Beginning early in life, the reduction in α-Gal A activity results in an accumulation of 
glycosphingolipids, including globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-
Gb3), and leads to the symptoms and life-limiting sequelae of Fabry disease, including pain, 
gastrointestinal symptoms, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular events, and early mortality 
(Germain, 2010). Fabry disease encompasses a spectrum of disease severity and age at onset, and 
can be divided into two main phenotypes, “classic” and “late-onset” (Desnick et al., 2001). Classical 
Fabry disease can affect all 3 major organs (heart, kidney, central nervous system) and in end-stage 
disease trigger life-threatening events. In contrast, variant α-Gal A mutations may result in less 
aggressive clinical phenotypes, which are, leading to single organ involvement and late onset disease 
(Niemann et al., 2014) or so called “atypical” Fabry patients.  
More than 841 Fabry disease-causing GLA mutations have been identified (data on file by applicant; 
SmPC section 5.1). Approximately 60% are missense mutations, resulting in single amino acid 
substitutions in α Gal A (Germain 2010; Gal et al., 2006). The majority of missense mutations are 
associated with the classic phenotype (Filoni et al., 2010; Topaloglu et al., 1999; Shabbeer et al., 
2002; Shabbeer et al., 2006; Ishii et al., 2007). This application considers patients with amenable 
mutations, i.e. patients with migalastat-responsive GLA mutations. Whether a patient is amenable to 
migalastat is unrelated to the disease burden they might have/experience. Recent literature indicates 
that the genotype cannot be translated to a phenotype. For example mutation A143T causes FD in only 
a limited number of carriers. 
For the treatment of Fabry disease the standard treatment is Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), 
irrespective of the severity of the disease. It consists of intravenous (IV) infusion of manufactured 
enzyme every 14 days. This is currently the only authorised treatment available to Fabry patients. Two 
products are available in the European Union, agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme) and agalsidase alfa 
(Replagal). The indications for these ERT’s are: “<ERT> is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement 
therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency).” Based 
on literature it is known that patients with late onset Fabry disease (also known as atypical or non-
classic Fabry patients) show deterioration, requiring treatment to prevent further disease progression. 
This is the most important clinical rationale to treat late onset patients as advised in the current 
guidelines. 
Migalastat, a low molecular weight iminosugar, is an analogue of the terminal galactose of GL-3. 
Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that migalastat acts as a pharmacological 
chaperone, selectively and reversibly binding with high affinity to the active site of wild-type α-Gal A 
and specific mutant forms of α Gal A (Ishii et al., 2007), the genotypes of which are referred to as 
amenable mutations. Migalastat binding stabilizes these mutant forms of α-Gal A in the endoplasmic 
reticulum, facilitating their proper trafficking to lysosomes where dissociation of migalastat allows α-
Gal A to reduce the level of GL-3 and lyso-Gb3 (Yam et al., 2005, Yam et al., 2006; Benjamin et al., 
2009).

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 123 mg of migalastat (as hydrochloride) 
as active substance. 
Other ingredients are pregelatinised starch (maize), magnesium stearate (for capsule contents); 
gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171) and indigotine (E132) (for capsule shell); shellac, black iron oxide and 
potassium hydroxide (for printing ink).  
The product is available in PVC / PCTFE / PVC/Al blister in a pack size of 14 capsules as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance is migalastat hydrochloride, a novel active substance not described in any 
pharmacopoeia. The chemical name of migalastat hydrochloride is (+)- (2R,3S,4R,5S)-2-
(hydroxymethyl)piperidine-3,4,5-triol, hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula 
C6H13NO4∙HCl. Migalastat hydrochloride has a relative molecular mass of 199.63 g/mol (hydrochloride 
salt) and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Structure of migalastat hydrochloride 
The structure of migalastat hydrochloride is supported by the route of synthesis and confirmed by 
XRD, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS, IR and elemental analysis. 
The active substance is a white to almost white crystalline solid, which is freely soluble in aqueous 
media between pH 1.2 and 7.5. These properties are adequate for an oral solid dosage form. 
Migalastat hydrochloride contains 4 chiral centres and is manufactured as the 2R,3S,4R,5S isomer. It 
has been demonstrated, as part of the active substance development studies, that no epimers are 
formed during the manufacturing process and based on these findings it was also concluded that no 
other diastereoisomers will be formed. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for migalastat hydrochloride. The applicant has submitted as part 
of the MAA full details of chemistry, manufacturing process, quality controls during manufacture and 
process validation. 
Migalastat hydrochloride is considered a new active substance from a quality perspective. The applicant 
compared its structure with active substances within authorised products in the EU and demonstrated 
Assessment report  
EMA/272226/2016 
Page 11/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixtures of isomers, complex or derivative (e.g. pro-drug or 
metabolite) of any of them. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The source of the starting material to produce migalastat is controlled by a specification. The 
manufacturing process development has been performed using some Quality by Design (QbD) 
principles but no design space has been claimed. Target set-points, normal operating ranges or proven 
acceptable ranges (PARs) for all the manufacturing process critical process parameters (CPPs) as well 
as non-CPPs have been described in the dossier. The proposed operating ranges are consistent with 
the ranges studied and confirmed during development.  
Adequate discussion on the carry-over and control of potential impurities in the final active substance 
has been provided. Potential impurities are sufficiently purged in the process, controlled in the final 
active substance or a suitable intermediate. The product-related genotoxic impurity C-025487 is 
controlled. An adequate discussion on genotoxic impurities has also been provided. Screening studies 
for genotoxic impurities have been performed in accordance with ICH M7 on genotoxic impurities 
combining an expert rule based methodology with a statistical-based methodology. The absence of 
control limits for the impurities that were found to be genotoxic has been adequately justified based on 
batch analysis data and purging studies and is acceptable in view of the ICH M7 option 4 for the 
control of process related impurities. 
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have 
been presented. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis.  
Reprocessing is described for the intermediate grade migalastat hydrochloride if it does not comply 
with the specification. It may be crystallised by performing a recrystallization process. The approach 
proposed by the Applicant is endorsed. 
Several changes have been introduced during the development of the manufacturing process.  It was 
demonstrated by comparative batch analysis data that these changes did not impact the quality of the 
active substance. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is stored in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags inside an opaque polyethylene 
(PE) container with a natural rubber seal ring, which comply with Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 and with 
Ph.Eur.3.1.3 (polyolefines). 
Specification 
The set of active substance specifications have been established in-house by the applicant. The 
analytical procedures have been described in sufficient detail or reference was made to the relevant 
Ph.Eur. method. The non-compendial analytical methods have been adequately validated in accordance 
with the ICH NfG on Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology. The stability indicating 
nature of the HPLC method for assay and related substances has been confirmed by means of forced 
degradation studies. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analytical data demonstrating compliance with the active substance specification have been 
provided for three production scale batches. These data confirm consistency of the product quality and 
manufacturing process.  
Assessment report  
EMA/272226/2016 
Page 12/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability 
Stability data on the active substance have been provided for six production scale batches stored at 
30°C/65% RH (18-36 months) and 40°C/75% RH (6 months). The batches were stored in a LDPE bag 
inside a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) container. The container and contact material are fully 
representative of the container proposed for routine bulk storage and transport of the active 
substance. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, related substances, water content, identity 
and microbial quality. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. The stability 
results showed no trends or changes in any of the tested parameters at both storage conditions.  
In addition, the active substance was also demonstrated to remain stable when stored under stress 
conditions, i.e. in a refrigerator at 5°C (12 months), at 40°C/75% RH fully exposed (3 months), at 
50°C/ambient RH (3 months), under freeze/thaw cycling conditions (two repeated cycles of 7 days at -
20°C followed by 7 days at 30°C for 1 month) and exposed to ICH Q1B light conditions.  
The active substance was shown not to be sensitive to light or humidity exposure, so no precautionary 
light or humidity protection statements are considered necessary.  
Based on the data presented, the proposed retest period of 36 months without any special storage 
requirements is justified.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Product description 
The finished product is formulated as an immediate release, hard capsule containing 123 mg 
migalastat free base (corresponding to 150 mg of migalastat hydrochloride). The capsules are size 2 
hard gelatin capsules with an opaque blue cap and opaque white body printed with “A1001” in black. 
The product is packed in PVC-PCTFE-PVC/Al blisters. The blisters are contained in a paperboard 
secondary pack. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains principles of QbD. The quality target 
product profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate release capsule dosage form, which can be 
swallowed easily, that meets compendial and other relevant quality standards at manufacture and over 
the proposed shelf-life, and is packaged in a pack that is convenient for the patient and which provides 
physical and moisture protection. The product design and formulation selection was based on the 
QTPP.  
Based on the QTPP finished product CQAs and CQAs of input and in-process materials were defined.  
The relationship between active substance attributes and finished product CQAs was evaluated through 
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) risk assessment. These attributes are either adequately 
controlled as part of the drug substance specification (identity, assay and related substances) or it has 
been sufficiently demonstrated or discussed that the attribute is not critical for the finished product 
CQAs (PSD, moisture, solid state form).  
Assessment report  
EMA/272226/2016 
Page 13/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following finished product CQAs have been identified and their control strategy described in the 
dossier:  
  Description is controlled by the requirements for capsule size, colour and imprint which are 
controlled on the empty capsules at release, as IPC during encapsulation and in the finished 
product. 
 
Identity of the active substance is controlled as part of the active substance specification as 
well as the finished product specification. 
  Content and uniformity of dosage units are controlled by the acceptance criterion for content in 
the active substance specification, the screening of migalastat hydrochloride during 
manufacture, by the IPC tests for mean capsule weight and individual capsule weight during 
encapsulation and by testing assay and uniformity of dosage units in the finished product 
specification. 
  Drug related impurities are controlled by the active substance specification as well as the 
finished product specification. 
  Dissolution is controlled by the acceptance criterion for disintegration time for the empty 
capsule shells at release and by the dissolution test in the finished product specification. 
  Microbiological quality is controlled by the microbial acceptance criteria for the empty capsule 
shell and by end product testing. 
For the pre-printed hard gelatin capsules the identified input CQAs are controlled through the capsule 
shell specification: description, water content, disintegration time and microbiological quality. 
The list of all excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. All 
excipients used in the formulation are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur standards. The pre-printed hard gelatin capsules are controlled by an in-house 
specification.  
The compatibility of the excipients with the active substance was confirmed by the results of the formal 
stability studies. 
Subsequently, 25 mg and 250 mg strength capsules (as the hydrochloride salt) were developed for 
clinical studies in order to provide dosing flexibility (across a range of doses) and convenience of 
dosing with a simple dosage form.  
A 150 mg dosage strength (as hydrochloride salt), equivalent to 123 mg free base, was developed for 
the Phase III studies and commercialization. This formulation approach was similar to the 25 mg and 
250 mg strengths, but a size 2 capsule was selected in order to accommodate the fill weight and the 
blue colouring agent in the cap of the capsule shell was varied. It was demonstrated that dissolution of 
the 25 mg and 250 mg capsules used in the phase II clinical studies was similar to that of the Phase III 
clinical batches. 
Formulations used in the open label phase of the Phase III pivotal clinical studies were identical in 
composition to the primary stability batches and the intended commercial product and only vary from 
commercial product in terms of print details (the same ink is used). It was demonstrated that these 
differences did not impact the dissolution of the finished product, and the batches used throughout the 
clinical development are considered representative of the final commercial product. Routine dissolution 
testing is performed using the Ph.Eur. paddle apparatus at 50 rpm with 900 ml 0.1N HCl at 37°C as 
dissolution medium. The development of the dissolution method for quality control of the finished

product has been adequately described. It is recommended that migalastat Capsules 123 mg be taken 
under fasted conditions. The proposed dissolution medium is considered representative of the acidity of 
the stomach under fasted conditions.  
Although the dissolution method was shown to be discriminatory with respect to cross-linking of gelatin 
in the capsule shell, once the capsule shell has ruptured and the contents have disintegrated, the 
method is not discriminating with respect to the dissolution of migalastat because of its high solubility 
and rapid dissolution across the physiological pH range. 
This lack of discriminating power was confirmed by a media-screening exercise using two batches of 
finished product that differed in active substance manufacturer and capsule shell. The results 
demonstrated rapid dissolution (about 100% dissolved in 15 minutes) for both tested batches in all 
dissolution media. No pH sensitivity or difference between the two formulations was detected. Although 
not discriminating, the applicant concluded that the dissolution method is acceptable as the finished 
product is designed to produce immediate release, bioavailability is not significantly affected by 
dissolution and changes in formulation and manufacturing variables do not affect dissolution in media 
over the range pH 1.2 – 6.8, which is in accordance with ICH Q6A, decision tree #7. This is considered 
acceptable. 
The manufacturing process development has been adequately performed and described according to 
the ICH Q8-Q10 QbD approach. An early risk assessment was performed across the unit operations to 
direct experimental activities to support development of a commercial control strategy. The 
assessment was based on prior knowledge, manufacturing experience with this product and 
experimental results generated prior to the assessment. Identified failure modes which highlighted 
attributes and process parameters that could impact product quality were assessed by a FMEA risk 
analysis tool. The risks were prioritised and used to inform development activities to understand and 
control the risks to acceptable levels.  The potential CQAs and CPPs were subsequently taken into 
univariate and/or multivariate studies to understand the link between them and the finished product 
CQAs and establish ranges for the CPPs as elements of the control strategy. Based on the development 
studies and risk assessments no CPPs have been identified for the manufacturing process, except for 
the screen size for the screening of the active substance before blending. The output from the 
experimental work programme and risk assessment was then used to update and enhance the 
commercial control strategy. 
The finished product is packed in PVC blisters sealed with aluminium foil with heat-seal lacquer. The 
packaging material is usual for oral solid dosage forms and complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. 
The packaging material meets de USP <671> Class A criteria for moisture permeation. Seal integrity 
was confirmed by showing no permeation of methylene blue in water under vacuum. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product. 
The finished product is packed in blisters that are encased in a paperboard secondary pack (blister 
sleeve). Removal of the capsule entails pushing through the paperboard and aluminium blister foil 
material. The chosen packaging represents the best combination of child resistance and user friendly 
removal of capsules. The integrity of the capsules following removal from the blisters will be further 
monitored through the company’s quality system for any product complaints post authorization and 
measures for improvement will be considered. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The main manufacturing process steps are the screening of migalastat hydrochloride and 
pregelatinised starch, (dry) blending (pre-lubrication and lubrication), encapsulation and packaging.

This is a straightforward standard process. The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient 
detail. The description of the manufacturing process distinguishes between CPPs and non-CPPs. No 
design space is claimed (nor has been developed) for the finished product manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process has been adequately validated according to relevant European guidelines. 
Process validation data on the product has been presented for seven production scale batches, 
demonstrating that the process and operating parameters are suitable to yield finished product of 
consistent quality. The homogeneity of the final blend before encapsulation is not considered a critical 
aspect. This was further confirmed by the final batch analysis results of the final product. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications are appropriate for this kind of dosage form and include 
tests for appearance (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.) and microbial quality (Ph. Eur.).  
Related substances are not tested at release of the finished product but will comply with the 
specifications if tested. The specification for microbial quality was set in accordance with the 
Ph.Eur.5.1.4 requirements for non-aqueous preparations for oral use. This is acceptable and skip-
testing for this parameter is considered justified based on the batch analysis data and stability data 
that consistently show compliance with the Ph.Eur.5.1.4 requirements. 
The proposed specification of the finished product is considered acceptable.  
The analytical methods have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis results are provided for seven production scale batches and confirm the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specifications.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications through 
traditional final product release testing.  
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard used for assay testing has been presented. 
Stability of the finished product 
Stability data on the finished product have been provided on three production scale batches stored at 
25°C/60% RH (36 months), 30°C/75% RH (36 months) and 40°C/75% RH (6 months). The conditions 
used in the stability studies are according to the ICH stability guideline. The batches were stored in the 
commercial packaging (i.e. PVC-PCTFE-PVC/Al-blisters).  
Samples were tested for description, assay, related substances, dissolution, microbial quality, water 
content and equilibrium relative humidity (for information). The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating. 
No changes or trends were seen in any of the relevant stability parameters under all three storage 
conditions. Results of a photo stability study on one batch of finished product in accordance with ICH 
Q1B showed that the finished product was not sensitive to light exposure.  
In section 6.4 of the SmPC, it is further specified to store the product in the original package in order 
to protect it from moisture. This storage precaution has been requested due to the sensitivity of gelatin 
capsules for moisture (in order to ensure that product quality will not be impacted by moisture if kept 
outside the primary packaging).

Adventitious agents 
Gelatin obtained from bovine sources is used in the hard capsules. Valid TSE Certificates of suitability 
issued by the EDQM have been provided.  
The shellac used in the black ink, (pre-printed on the capsule shells) is derived from insects; however, 
insects are not implicated in BSE/TSE. 
No other substances of animal origin are present in the product nor have any been used in the 
manufacturing of this product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The active substance migalastat has been demonstrated to be very stable as such and also when 
incorporated in the finished product. The development of the active substance was extensive. It 
showed a good understanding of the process, critical process parameters and the formation, fate and 
purge of impurities. 
The absence of control limits for the impurities that were found to be genotoxic has also been 
confirmed based on batch analysis data and purging studies and is acceptable in view of the ICH M7 
option 4 for the control of process related impurities. 
Dissolution has been identified as a critical process parameter and is controlled by the acceptance 
criterion for disintegration time for the empty capsule shells at release and by the dissolution test in 
the finished product specification. Routine dissolution testing is performed using the Ph.Eur. method 
(paddle apparatus). The development of the dissolution method for quality control of the finished 
product has been adequately described.  
The finished product is packed in blisters that are encased in a paperboard secondary pack (blister 
sleeve). Removal of the capsule entails pushing through the paperboard and aluminium blister foil 
material. Evaluation of this packaging in practice showed that pushing the capsules through the blister 
foil and paperboard was not easy and flexing of the capsules occurred in some cases. This issue was 
further addressed by the Applicant through a justification that the chosen packaging represents the 
best combination of child resistance and user friendly removal of capsules. It was further clarified that 
flexed capsules did not affect the integrity of the capsules. The issue will be further monitored through 
the company’s quality system for any product complaints post authorization and measures for 
improvement will be considered. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant submitted a detailed non clinical package in support of their application as detailed 
below.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
In in vitro studies using the recombinant human forms of α-GAL A (agalsidase alpha and beta), it was 
shown that migalastat binds to rhα-GAL A with high affinity. It also stabilizes degradation of the 
enzymes at different pH’s and temperatures.  
In studies using cell lines from human volunteers and Fabry patients, it was shown that migalastat can 
reach intracellular α-GAL A and bind to both wild-type and mutant forms of the enzyme, since 
increased levels and activity of enzyme were measured. Not all mutant forms were however responsive 
to migalastat treatment (49 out of 75), and in a similar experiment 23 out of 29 mutants had a Ki in 
the range of wild-type α-GAL A (21 nM to 68nM range for mutant compared to 21 nM for wild-type).  
The effect of increased enzyme activity was sustained for several days after removal of the drug from 
the test medium, with half-lives that varied depending on the specific mutation, ranging from 11 hours 
to >120 hours. To further investigate the effect of a wash-out period, Fabry fibroblasts with two 
specific mutations showed a decrease in GL-3 levels when treated for 7 days with a 3 day wash-out 
period. In contrast, no decrease in GL-3 level was seen after 10 days continuous treatment, indicating 
an inhibitory effect of migalastat on enzyme function when it is bound to α-GAL A.  
In a study using normal human fibroblasts and thus wild-type α-GAL A, it was shown that the half-life 
of α-GAL A inhibition (measured as GL-3 turnover) by migalastat was in the order of 2-3 hours, 
indicating rapid removal of migalastat from the enzyme when treatment is stopped.  
These in vitro studies indicate that migalastat can bind to a significant number of mutant forms of α-
GAL A in the endoplasmic reticulum, it stabilizes the enzyme and allows for trafficking through the 
Golgi body to lysosomes, where it dissociates from α-GAL A and allows for the enzyme to be active and 
cleave GL-3 into downstream products.  
To better quantify the responsiveness of the specific mutant forms of α-GAL A to migalastat, an in vitro 
assay was developed. To date (March 10th 2016), 850 GLA mutations have been categorised as either 
amenable (n=269) or non-amenable (n=581). 
The data provided show that migalastat binds to human α-GAL A, both wild-type and some mutant 
forms. Sequence homology for α-galactosidase A between mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, monkeys, and 
humans is approximately 85%, 86%, 88%, 90%, and 99%, respectively. In addition the Applicant 
provided data for rat, rabbit, monkey, and human, the Ki values for α-galactosidase A are 7.7, 9.3, 
11.4, and 11.2 nanomolar, respectively, similar to that for mouse (10.6 nanomolar).  The comparable 
Ki values between species suggest functional and specific binding in the selected animals. 
In vivo studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/272226/2016 
Page 18/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A Fabry mouse model was used for in vivo pharmacodynamic studies. This mouse model expresses a 
human mutant α-GAL A transgene on a mouse Gla knockout background (hR301Q α-GAL A Tg/KO). 
This mouse model shows age-dependent accumulation of GL-3 in disease-relevant tissues. Several 
experiments were performed with this mouse model. After 4 weeks of continuous treatment, α-GAL A 
tissue levels were increased in skin, heart and kidney, dose-dependently up to 300 mg/kg/day. 
However, GL-3 reductions were optimal at 30 mg/kg/day). Different dosing regiments however, 
showed that dosing for 4 days, followed by 3 days wash-out, resulted in a greater reduction in tissue 
GL-3 than daily dosing at 300 mg/kg/day. These results are is in line with the in vitro data and mouse 
tissue data showing a sustained increased α-GAL A level for several days (half-life of 2-2.5 days) even 
after migalastat levels have dropped to near zero after a single day. Additionally further studies 
showed that long term treatment of up to 6 months with the 4 on/3 off regimen resulted in even 
greater GL-3 reductions in heart and skin, and that migalastat is active in both young and older mice 
(corresponding to prevention versus reversal of accumulation).  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamics of migalastat were evaluated in vitro. Several assays for enzyme 
selectivity have been performed by the applicant.  
A standard assay of 83 receptors and enzymes showed no significant binding. Specific evaluations 
using other lysosomal enzymes and lysates from human blood to specifically look for galactose 
metabolism also showed no significant binding, except for the lysosomal enzyme α-N-
Acetylgalactosaminidase (NAGA). Although the affinity of migalastat for this enzyme is 120-fold lower 
than for α-GAL A, the IC50 of 7 µM (1.4 µg/ml), it is in the range of the clinical Cmax of migalastat of 
2 µg/ml. There is high homology between human and rat NAGA,  and no effects that could be related 
to a possible inhibition of NAGA in the rat toxicology studies with more frequent dosing than the 
proposed  clinical dosing regimen were observed.  
Additionally, In vitro experiments with migalastat showed 95% inhibition of NAGA, but only at high 
concentrations which are not expected to be reached using the therapeutic dose. Furthermore, 
incubation of normal human fibroblasts with migalastat HCl modestly increased NAGA enzyme levels in 
intact cells, suggesting a lack of detrimental effects on the proteostasis network. Finally, Ki values for 
NAGA of 6.8 and 8.4 μM, were seen for human and rat NAGA, respectively. Considering that the 
sequence alignments of monkey, rat, and mouse NAGA indicate 98%, 90%, and 90% homology to the 
human ortholog, respectively, thishis would suggest that the toxicology species used are suitable to 
investigate inhibitory effects on NAGA by migalastat. 
Due to migalastats molecular structure, the interaction with glucose/galactose transporters is of 
interest. Interaction with SGLT1, which is predominantly expressed in the gastro-intestinal tract, has 
been evaluated in this respect, which shows IC50 values of migalastat as a substrate for and inhibitor 
of SGLT1 which are in excess of the clinical Cmax. Furthermore, interaction with glucose absorption 
has been investigated in clinical studies, and showed only a marginal reduction in migalastat AUC and 
Cmax in subjects having taken a high glucose drink as discussed in the clinical AR.  
Data were presented about possible interactions with the SGLT2 transporter. This transporter is 
predominantly expressed in the kidney where it is involved in glucose reabsorption, and it is the target 
of several antidiabetic drugs. Affinity for SGLT2 could therefore lead to interactions with SGLT2 
inhibitors with potential consequences when these two drugs are taken together. The Applicant has 
provided data to demonstrate that migalastat is neither a substrate for SGLT2 nor an inhibitor

Safety pharmacology programme 
In safety pharmacology studies, migalastat had no effect on the hERG currents when tested up to 47.5 
µM. an in vivo study in dogs showed also no effect on mean, diastolic, or systolic arterial blood 
pressure, heart rate, or ECGs, including the QT and corrected QT intervals, when tested up to 100 
mg/kg/day. No toxicokinetics were performed, however when  extrapolating  from other dog studies 
conducted by the applicant, it is likely that both Cmax and AUC at the high migalastat dose tested in 
animals are well above the Cmax and AUC values  observed in the clinical studies with  the 
recommended dose of migalastat (around 50-fold for Cmax and 20-fold for AUC).  
In rats, no effect on any central nervous system was observed at doses tested up to 100 mg/kg. It is 
recognised that the exposure achieved is lower in rats than dogs non clinical studies. However, 
extrapolation of toxicokinetics from other studies indicate that the  exposure achieved at the high dose 
was acceptable being  likely around 8-fold above the human values for Cmax and 2-fold for AUC.  
In rats, no effects on respiratory parameters were seen after treatment with up to 100 mg/kg. In 
summary the safety pharmacology of migalastat has been sufficiently investigated. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Several studies have been performed to investigate the interaction of migalastat with currently 
approved enzyme replacement therapies agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta, both in vitro and in vivo 
in rats and the Fabry mouse model. These studies show that concurrent treatment with an ERT and 
migalastat has an additive effect. This is to be expected since migalastat does not only bind to 
endogenous mutant α-GAL A, but also to agalsidase, and therefore has a stabilizing effect on these 
enzymes allowing them to have a longer lasting effect. The applicant indicates that it is unlikely that 
patients will receive both treatments; however, preclinical studies indicate a potential substantial 
benefit. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Well-described and validated LC MS/MS methods were used in the toxicokinetic studies. However, 
some of the toxicokinetic studies included much higher concentrations than the maximum 
concentration for which the methods were validated.  
Absorption 
Results of in vitro cellular permeability studies in Caco-2 cells indicate that cellular permeability is low 
and P-gp is not involved in intestinal absorption/elimination. According to the applicant, absorption 
through paracellular pathways may be involved. This conclusion is not endorsed since it is based on a 
study with Caco-2 cell monolayers with compromised integrity (by EGTA treatment). Considering the 
characteristics of the migalastat molecule, it might possibly be a substrate for monosaccharide 
transporters, which could be responsible for its fast absorption. Besides SGLT1, this has not been 
investigated and  Migalastat is a low affinity substrate for SGLT1. 
Absorption was fast in all examined animal species. In mice, rats and rabbits plasma Tmax was equal to 
or earlier than the earliest plasma sampling time points at 0.25 – 1 h post dose. In dogs and monkeys, 
Tmax was about 1-2 h after oral administration. In a rat radiolabel mass balance study ,comparison of 
plasma Cmax 1 h after a single oral dose of 50 mg 14C-migalastat/kg to the same dose of non-labelled 
migalastat suggests that at tmax most of the circulating material consists of unmetabolised migalastat. 
Plasma pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics 
Assessment report  
EMA/272226/2016 
Page 20/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oral bioavailability was high (up to 100%) in mice and not investigated in other animal species. In a 
rat mass balance study absorption was at least about a third of the oral dose after a single oral dose of 
50 mg 14C-migalastat/kg based on urinary excretion .. No information regarding degree of absorption 
or bioavailability was available for the other laboratory species used in the toxicity studies. 
After IV administration, male mice had a plasma elimination t1/2 of < 1 h, clearance of 1.5-2.5 L/h/kg 
and Vss 0.4-0.8 L/kg. The short elimination half life was considered due to the relatively low 
distribution volume. IV plasma pharmacokinetics was not studied in the other species used for toxicity 
studies. 
After oral administration, t1/2 in mice (both sexes) was < 1 - 3.3 h and exposure of females appeared 
slightly higher compared to males. In repeated dose toxicity studies , toxicokinetic data in orally 
treated male and female rats, dogs and monkeys showed mostly t1/2 values of 1.5 – 5 h, 2 - 7 h and 3 
- 5 h respectively, with higher values in some rat (up to 8h) and monkey studies (up to 12 h) with no 
clear gender difference. In general, the increase of AUC0-t was  less than dose-proportional, in 
particular at higher doses and no evidence of accumulation was observed.  
In pregnant rabbits, orally treated from GD6 – GD19, exposure increased slightly in asupra 
proportional manner  with  exposure observed at  GD19 being about twice as high as the one observed 
at GD6. The accumulation observed in this species may be due to reabsorption from the intestinal tract 
or to coprophagia, the latter is also suggested by rising plasma concentrations 10 - 18 h after the 
dose. Since this is observed only in rabbits, it does not appear to be clinically relevant.  
In the animal studies , Cmax and AUC0-t level achieved were far higher than those in humans, 
considering also that inclinical studies, the dosign regimen is  once every other day compared to once 
to twice daily in the animal studies.  
Distribution 
In animal (CD-1 mouse, Sprague-Dawley rat, and cynomolgus monkey) and human plasma, at 
concentrations of 1 – 100 µM, migalastat did not bind significantly to plasma proteins.  
In male Sprague-Dawley rats the blood to plasma ratio of 14C Migalastat related radioactivity indicated 
no preferential distribution to blood cells.  
Tissue distribution studies in mice and rats indicated distribution to the major excretory organs and to 
target tissues relevant for the pharmacodynamic indication of migalastat (kidney, heart, brain, skin, 
muscle, spleen, liver). The concentration in brain is delayed compared to plasma and other examined 
tissues, indicating slower penetration of brain compared to the other tissues. Tissue/plasma ratio’s of 
in particular in brain and in spleen indicated a slower clearance from these tissues than from plasma.  
The distribution to target tissues relevant for the pharmacodynamic indication of migalastat was 
assessed. Other tissues, such as intestinal tract, pancreas, organs of the reproductive system, 
pigmented tissues and low-perfused tissues such as fat tissue were not included as considered relevant 
by the applicant. As chronic toxicity studies did not reveal other target organs of toxicity, it can be 
concluded that the provided study is adequateand considered sufficient,. 
In the pre-postnatal rat toxicity study significant distribution of migalastat to foetal plasma to rat milk 
was observed.(see details below) 
Metabolism 
In vitro biotransformation:  
Assessment report  
EMA/272226/2016 
Page 21/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatocytes from Sprague-Dawley rats, cynomolgus monkeys, or humans did not metabolise 14C-
migalastat during incubation for 1 – 4 h. 
In vivo biotransformation: 
Plasma: After a single oral dose of 50 mg 14C-migalastat/kg in 3 male Sprague Dawley rats, plasma 
radioactivity at 1 – 12 h post dose consisted mainly of unchanged parent compound, and small 
amounts of (unidentified) metabolites.  Excreta: After a single oral dose of 50 mg 14C-migalastat/kg in 
Sprague Dawley rats (3/sex), most of 14C migalastat related radioactivity excreted up to 24 h post 
dose in urine and up to 48 h in faeces consisted of unchanged parent compound. About 10-14% of the 
dose was excreted as metabolites in faeces and only about 3-10% in urine, and summed for urine + 
faeces about 16 (females) – 21 (males) % of the dose.  
Excretion 
In rats, after a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg 14C-migalastat, radiolabel was primarily excreted in the 
faeces (51-67%) and urine (17-38%), within 24-48 hours. Excretion in expired air was examined in 
one rat of each sex (dose 1500 mg/kg) and was negligible. Excretion in bile was not studied. 
Therefore, it cannot be assessed whether the material excreted in faeces has been absorbed.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant provided a complete toxicity assessment from animal studies. A single dose otoxicities 
studies were performed in in both rats and dogs at high doses that greatly exceed the intended clinical 
dose. Prolonged exposure to migalastat was evaluated in pivotal toxicology studies in rats up to 26 
weeks and in Cynomolgus monkeys up to 39 weeks. In addition, shorter repeat dose toxicity studies 
were performed in mice, rats, dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys and in transgenic galactosidase A 
knockout mice in a combination study with Fabrazyme. Developmental and reproductive toxicity 
studies were performed in rat and rabbit, carcinogenicity studies were performed in rat and transgenic 
mice coding for an oncogene promoter. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats at a dose of 1500 mg/kg and in 
Beagle dogs at a dose of 316 mg/kg. The high dose was well tolerated in both rats and dogs. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose toxicity studies in mice 
A 28 day study in mice showed that migalastat was relatively well tolerated at doses up to 
2000mg/kg/d. At high doses, irritation of the large intestine and, apoptosis of the mesenteric lymph 
node was observed, which is considered to result from  local irritation due to  high concentrations of 
migalastat in the intestine rather than  systemic toxicity. In mice, migalastat exposures increased dose 
proportionally up to 1000 mg/kg/d, and supra proportionally at higher concentration. Cmax increase was 
less than dose proportional and accumulation was considered to be negligible. Exposures and Cmax were 
higher in females given 1000 or 2000 mg/kg/d than males.  Additionally, in the carcinogenicity study, 
females were given half the dose than males showed comparable exposures. Therefore, it can be 
considered that the difference in exposure may be a species specific gender effect.  
Repeat dose toxicity studies in rats 
Assessment report  
EMA/272226/2016 
Page 22/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 5 day repeat dose toxicity study in rats revealed no toxicologically relevant findings at doses up to 
1500 mg/kg/d. A 14 week study in rats was similarly well tolerated and showed only procedure related 
changes as result of oral gavage and mild irritation due to high concentrations of migalastat in the 
stomach. Long term exposure was evaluated in rats in a 26 week toxicity study. There were no 
changes in clinical observations with the exception of soft faeces in the high dose group (1500 mg/kg 
bid). There were  also no changes in body weight, body weight gain or food consumption, haematology 
or serum chemistry changes. Urine pH was decreased in high dose treated animals and was reversible 
but is not considered to be of toxicological relevance. The spleen was considered to be the target organ 
at the highest dose tested: increased spleen weight was partially reversible and minimal to slight 
increased lymphoid follicles were observed from the low dose group onwards. In the high dose group, 
this was not fully reversed at the end of recovery. The findings in spleen were observed in absence of 
secondary immune changes. These findings in spleen were not observed in the pivotal repeatdose 
toxicity study in monkeys and therefore not considered to be a  relevant finding.  
A combination study with Fabrazyme in rats did not show adverse synergistic effects.  
In rats, exposure and Cmax increased in a less than dose proportional manner in both males and 
females and while no accumulation was noted in a 14 day study, in the 26 week study accumulation 
was noted at all dose levels (28.7, 10.9 and 4.3% at dose levels of 100, 500, and 1500 mg/kg/day, 
respectively on Day 181). Exposures were above the intended clinical exposure. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Repeat dose toxicity study in dogs 
A 5 day repeat dose toxicity study in dogs with doses up to 500 mg/kg revealed no toxicologically 
relevant findings. Similarly, migalastat was devoid of toxicity in a 14 day repeat dose study in dogs 
with the exception of an increase in liquid faeces in the high dose group, considered to be likely 
migalastat related. In dogs, exposures and Cmax increased in a less than dose proportional manner. 
Due to the low number of animals, there is high inter-animal variability in exposure and may have 
resulted in observed differences between males and females, the latter having a higher exposure.  
Repeat dose toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys 
In a 14 day repeat dose toxicity study in monkeys, observed findings were related to blood parameters 
in males receiving upwards of 200 mg/kg/d migalastat, and were considered likely due to the 
intubation for gavage. In the 39 week repeatdose toxicity study in monkeys, there were no deaths, or 
changes in body weight, cardiovascular parameters, urinalysis or gross pathology. Slightly decreased 
red blood cell count and haemoglobin values were however noted in females given 500 mg/kg/d after 
169 days. The reduced values normalised at the end of study period and after recovery. The findings 
are considered to be of no toxicological relevance despite being statistically significant. Similarly, an 
increase in GGT on day 84 and onwards in animals given 200 mg/kg/d migalastat was attributed to a 
few animals with higher GGT activity, and higher values were also seen at earlier time-points in control 
animals and pre-test. This finding was therefore considered not of relevance. In animals given 200 
mg/kg/d and upwards, minimal dilatation of lymphatics in duodenum at terminal sacrifice was noted 
slightly higher in the treatment group than in the control group. There are no other related findings 
that would suggest toxicity, nor are there gross pathology findings that are correlated to this finding. 
Therefore the toxicological relevance is considered to be of limited relevance. 
In monkeys, exposure increased less than dose proportionally without differences in male and female 
exposures. Cmax increased in a less than dose proportional manner between 50 and 200 mg/kg/day 
but was more or less comparable between 200 and 500 mg/kg/day in both the 14 day and the 39

week studies. Overall, there was no accumulation of migalastat after 14 days or 39 weeks across the 
entire dose range and exposures were well above those intended for clinical use. 
Genotoxicity 
Migalastat is not genotoxic in vivo or in vitro.  
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats.  
Migalastat was well tolerated in a 26-week transgenic (rasH2) mouse carcinogenicity study without 
changes in body weight, clinical signs or macroscopic findings related to treatment with migalastat. 
Mice carried the oncogene promoter rasH2. There were no microscopic findings in any migalastat 
treated animals that could be related to treatment. One palpable mass was detected in a female 
animal treated with 500mg/kg migalastat at week 16 and result of metastasis 
In the long term rat carcinogenicity study, decreased body weight was observed in male rats after 84 
weeks despite generally comparable food intake across all groups. This effect was more pronounced in 
females. There are no differences in mortality compared to the control groups. There were no 
differences in frequency of clinical signs or ophthalmology compared to controls that were related to 
migalastat treatment. The incidence of thymic cysts was increased in female rats in all groups including 
controls compared to males, although the incidence was higher in migalastat treated animals. 
Formation of cysts in aging female rats is a common observation and therefore not likely related to 
migalastat treatment. 
 The incidence of pancreas islet cell adenoma was significantly increased in males treated with 
800/1200 mg/kg/d migalastat and was above the incidence rate observed in historical controls. 
Migalastat is an iminosugar, and thus, the pancreas cannot be excluded as a possible target organ. 
After ruling out several non-genotoxic or hormonal mechanisms, absence of islet cell hyperplasia or 
any morphologic islet changes in chronic toxicity studies and the fact that proliferative endocrine 
lesions are a common background finding, the weight of evidence supports the fact that the observed 
islet cell adenoma in high dose treated males is not a migalastat related effect. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Male rats receiving migalastat showed drastically reduced fertility parameters in all migalastat groups 
despite comparable mating performance with the control group and in absence of changes in sperm 
parameters including mean sperm count, sperm motility or morphology. After a 4-week recovery 
period, females became pregnant, suggesting a migalastat related effect on male fertility. There were 
no apparent changes in anatomy or organ weight. Consistent with reduced fertility, the number of 
corpora lutea and thenumber of implantations are reduced in the migalastat females group. Similarly, 
post implantation loss was high in migalastat group. These findings were fully recoverable and corpora 
lutea, implantation, pre and post- implantation loss were comparable in all groups including controls. 
Increased lymphoid infiltrate in both left and right epididymis of high dose treated males was also been 
observed in some control animals and a treatment related effect was ruled out which was also 
confirmed by independent peer-review. Furthermore, based on the chemical and pharmacological 
similarities between migalastat and miglustat, in which infertility is also seen in male animals, it is 
hypothesized that infertility in migalastat treated male rats is likely based on one or more of the 
mechanisms of miglustat. While no effect was observed on sperm morphology or motility after 
treatment with migalastat, it remains possible that biochemical changes in acrosome composition may 
result in failure of sperm to complete capacitation and/or the acrosome reaction resulting in failure of

sperm to penetrate and/or activate the oocyte.  No toxicokinetic analysis was available for this study. 
However, considering that the doses are comparable to the ones used in the rat repeat dose toxicity 
studies, it can be assumed that exposures are comparable. Since a NOEL for fertility in males was not 
established, a second study in rats, was performed at  lower doses.In this study, reduced fertility and 
corresponding pregnancy parameters comparable to the previous study occurred at the highest dose 
tested (25 mg/kg/day) despite any change in mating performance. Exposure at the highest dose 
tested was 6663 ng.h/ml, which is considered to be below the intended human exposure.  
As miglustat, another iminosugar is also known to induce fully recoverable infertility in males, the 
effect is likely to be class-related. Therefore, migalastat  is considered to have an adverse effect on 
male fertility in rats above 10 mg/kg/day, which may be relevant for humans. In contrast, no effects of 
migalastat were seen on fertility in female rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/d migalastat. Therefore, 
migalastat is not considered to have an effect on female fertility. 
Embryofoetal toxicity of migalastat was evaluated in rats and rabbits..  
Anomalies such as dilated renal pelvis were observed with increased incidence in migalastat groups in 
comparison to control (litter incidence: 16% control group, 27.3 %, 32% and 31.8% in 100 mg/kg/d, 
500 mg/kg/d and 1500 mg/kg/d, respectively), but lacked a dose-response relationship and were 
below historical control incidence rates. The NOAEL in the embryofetal toxicity study was 1500 mg/kg. 
PK data taken from repeat-dose study indicate that the margins to human target exposure (AUC) are 
only 1.9 to 2.4 in females and males, respectively.  
In rabbits, maternal toxicity was apparent at the highest dose and manifested as anorexia and reduced 
food intake. The exposure exceededs the human exposure by more than 20-fold on gestation day 6 at 
the lowest dose tested. There were no pathological changes in females that could be considered 
treatment related. However, due to the maternal toxicity, post implantation loss was dose dependently 
increased from 300 mg/kg/day onwards and 7 females in the high dose group were euthanized due to 
anorexia after abortion. Post implantation loss was considered to be related to increased resorption 
incidence and consistent with the observed female toxicity. Foetal weights in the high dose group were 
decreased. Increased incidences of minor skeletal malformations and delayed ossification were 
considered  consistent with maternal anorexia. Foetal malformations were in line with historical control 
and also comparable to control group animals, therefore considered to be spontaneous findings and 
not treatment related. In conclusion, there is no evidence of teratogenic potential of migalastat in the 
rabbit, although maternal toxicity is apparent from the mid dose onwards. Therefore, the NOAEL for 
both maternal and offspring animals is 120 mg/kg/day in rabbit.  
Effects of migalastat on pre- and postnatal development were evaluated in rats, without any adverse 
effects in paternal or offspring animals. Similarly, there were no adverse effects in F2 offspring 
resulting from migalastat administration to F0-generation animals with the exception of slightly 
increased post-implantation loss in the mid and high dose groups. No dose-relationship was noted and 
the mean percentage post-implantation loss in the high dose group remained within the historical 
control range; thus not considered to be treatment related. In conclusion, there is no evidence of pre- 
or postnatal toxicity resulting from migalastat in rat. Migalastat is excreted in milk. The NOAEL is 
considered to be the highest dose tested, 1000 mg/kg/day.

The refined PECsw is 0.00077 µg/l, which is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/l. Migalastat is neither PBT 
nor vPvB. A further assessment is not deemed necessary and Migalastat is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacological activity migalastat has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo using 
recombinant human forms of α-GAL A. According to the Applicant, homology for α-galactosidase A 
between mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, monkeys, and humans is approximately 85%, 86%, 88%, 90%, and 
99%, respectively. , The Ki values for α-galactosidase A are 7.7, 9.3, 11.4, and 11.2 nanomolar,in rat, 
rabbit, monkey, and human respectively, similar to that for mouse (10.6 nanomolar). These 
comparable Ki values between species suggest functional and specific binding in the selected animals. 
In the repeated dose toxicity studies, the animals were dosed twice daily. This is not in line with the 
dosing regimen proposed for clinical use, of every other day. The consequence of twice daily dosing 
could be that instead of stabilization and activation of the enzyme, inhibition of the enzyme occurs due 
to prolonged exposure, as discussed in the pharmacodynamics section. Less frequent dosing might 
have resulted in low exposures, and an exaggerated pharmacology of enzyme activation would be 
difficult to detect since the healthy animals used in the toxicity studies have active enzyme already. 
Therefore the dosing regimen used in the repeated dose studies is acceptable. 
In general exposure multiples in animals were far above those in humans, especially when it is taken 
into account that migalastat is administered to humans every other day, whereas animals were 
exposed daily.  
Assessment report  
EMA/272226/2016 
Page 26/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In summary, preclinical data indicated that the best substrate reduction was observed with less-
frequent dosing compared to daily dosing due to sustained elevated α Gal A in the absence of 
chaperone. The 30 mg/kg less-frequent dosing was significantly better than 10 mg/kg and not 
significantly different from higher doses. Based on these data, less-frequent dosing regimens were 
evaluated in clinical studies, targeting the exposure seen in mice following administration of 30 mg/kg, 
which corresponds to the exposure associated with the 150 mg dose in human. 
Exposure to the parent compound was high in all species used in the pivotal toxicity studies, therefore, 
it is acceptable that metabolism was only studied in one species (rats) since no major metabolites were 
identified in humans, 
Chronic and high exposure to migalastat in rodent and non-rodent resulted in very limited toxicity. 
Spleen is the target organ in one pivotal rat repeat dose study, but this was not replicated in other 
species and therefore likely not clinically relevant. Migalastat has no genotoxic potential in vitro or in 
vivo. 
In carcinogenicity studies, the incidence of benign pancreatic islet cell adenoma was increased in high 
dose migalastat treated rats above the one seen in historical controls. Proliferative lesions were not 
observed in pancreas during chronic testing, and non-genotoxic and hormonal pathways could be ruled 
out. Because endocrine proliferative lesions are common in rat, migalastat is not genotoxic, and 
because non-genotoxic and hormonal mechanisms were ruled out it is not considered to be relevant for 
humans.  
Migalastat induces profound male infertility at clinically relevant exposures. The effect is fully reversible 
after cessation of treatment and is also observed for another iminosugar, miglustat, thus considered 
likely to be a class effect. Minimal epididymal lymphocyte infiltration was observed in high dose treated 
males and was not considered to be treatment related, nor the cause of the observed infertility. 
Migalastat had no adverse effects on embryofoetal, pre- and postnatal development in rats, and did 
not induce maternal toxicity. . In contrast, maternal toxicity is seen in rabbits at high exposures . As a 
result, post implantation loss was dose dependently increased.  Consistent with maternal anorexia, 
foetal weights in the high dose group were decreased as were minor skeletal malformations and 
delayed ossification. Foetal malformations were considered to be in line with historical controls and  
comparable to control group animals,. Therefore this was considered to be spontaneous and not 
treatment related. In conclusion, there is no evidence of teratogenic potential of migalastat in the 
rabbit, although maternal toxicity is apparent from the mid dose onwards. 
The high plasma concentration range in dogs and rabbits exceeded the QC range and the range 
validated in the analytical validation reports. Therefore, the toxicokinetic data of the high (rabbit) and 
mid – high (dogs) dose groups should be interpreted with caution  as values should only be considered 
approximations of exposure. , However considering the high exposure achieved in animal studies, 
(even in the low dose studies) compared to the exposure planned in human this shortcoming has no 
implications for the toxicological risk assessment 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology and toxicology of migalastat have been sufficiently characterised and support the 
use in humans.  The relevant findings have been adequately mentioned in the SmPC section 5.3.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The migalastat clinical development program comprised 20 studies and included patients with both the 
classic and late-onset phenotypes of Fabry disease. The design of the clinical program was based on 
relevant guidelines (guideline on clinical trials in small populations (CHMP/EWP/83561/2005)) as well 
as discussions with the Scientific Advice Working Party. 
Six Phase 2 and four Phase 3 studies (two pivotal and two open-label long-term extension studies) 
have been conducted in 180 patients with Fabry disease, of whom 168 (89M, 79F) have been exposed 
to migalastat (Figure 1). An additional two patients have received migalastat through physician-
initiated compassionate use programmes.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) behaviour of migalastat has been well-characterised in healthy volunteers 
and patients with Fabry disease. The clinical pharmacology of migalastat was characterised in ten 
Phase 1 studies (FAB-CL-103, AT1001-016, FAB-CL-101, FAB-CL 102, FAB-CL-104, AT1001-014, 
MGM115806, AT1001 015, AT1001-010, and AT1001-018). Additional PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) 
data were obtained from five Phase 2 and 3 studies in patients with Fabry disease (AT1001-013, FAB-
CL-201, FAB-CL-204, FAB-CL-205, and AT1001-011). 
Urinary recovery indicates that migalastat is absorbed for at least 77%. Solubility data showed that 
migalastat has a solubility of more than 500 mg/ml over the pH range of 1.2 to 7.5. Based upon 
solubility data and excretion data migalastat can be considered a BCS Class III (high solubility/low 
absorption).  
One analytical LC-MS/MS method has been applied for the analysis of migalastat in plasma. Validation 
suggested that the method was adequate. Stability was shown covering study sample handling and 
storage. This was also adequate in urine. Based upon the analytical reports, performance were within 
normal criteria with acceptable reproducibility. 
Absorption 
After oral administration, maximum migalastat plasma concentrations are observed after about 2.5 – 
3.5 h. The absolute bioavailability of migalastat is about 75%.  
A high fat, high caloric meal decreased migalastat AUC and Cmax by about 37 and 40%, respectively. A 
decreased absorption is also observed when migalastat is taken 1 h before a high fat meal and a light 
meal, i.e. AUC was 37 and 42% lower, and Cmax 15 and 18% lower, respectively. Also after intake of 
migalastat 1 h after intake of a light meal AUC and Cmax was decreased (40 and 39%, respectively). 
Concomitantly intake of migalastat with a glucose drink showed a small decrease in AUC and Cmax by 
14 and 10%, respectively. This latter study was carried out to confirm the impact of a glucose drink on 
migalastat pharmacokinetics, as migalastat appeared to be a substrate, although with low affinity, for 
SGLT1 (sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter). 
In clinical studies, migalastat was administered 2 h before or 2 h after food intake. Furthermore, 
patients were instructed to take migalastat at the same time of the day. This is in line with the SmPC 
recommendations. Based upon migalastat plasma concentration under fasting conditions at 2 h after 
administration and at tmax , the applicant suggested that  absorption was about 87% of the dose. 
Therefore it was considered that intake of a meal 2 hours after intake of migalastat would not impact 
the absorption of migalastat. This seems reasonable. Although not evaluated, it was expected that 
intake of migalastat 2 h after intake of a meal would not impact migalastat absorption. This 
assumption seems to neglect that 2 h after food intake, a considerable amount of food may be still in 
the stomach, with possible food interaction. As the SmPC recommendations were in line with the 
supportive clinical studies, this issue was considered adequately addressed.  
Three capsule formulations (25, 150 and 250 mg) and an oral solution without excipients were used in 
the clinical studies. The oral solution is bioequivalent to the 25 mg capsule.  
. The 150 mg capsule is shown to be dose proportional to the 250 mg capsule. The 150 mg commercial 
capsule formulation is considered similar to the 150 mg capsule formulation used in the clinical studies.  
For the 25 mg capsule, the difference in the amount of active substance was compensated by the 
amount of pregelatinised starch. No bioequivalence study is carried out to proof that the capsule

formulations are bioequivalent. This is acceptable, as 1) migalastat is highly soluble, 2) the qualitative 
compositions are similar 3) a difference in the amount of starch does not affect bioavailability as shown 
by the bioequivalence between the 25 mg capsule and the oral solution and 4) the capsule 
formulations show a very rapid dissolution at pH 1.2 (900 ml, 50 rpm). 
Based upon these data it is expected that the capsule formulations are bioequivalent. 
Linear pharmacokinetics is observed in healthy subjects up to 1250 mg single oral doses. At the higher 
2000 mg dose no further increase in AUC is observed. Linear pharmacokinetics is also observed up to 
150 mg oral b.i.d. doses.. Dose proportionality was also confirmed in patients with Fabry disease over 
the 25 – 250 mg dose range after single dose, as well as after b.i.d. and q.o.d. dosing.   
No unexpected accumulation is observed after multiple dosing b.i.d. or q.o.d dosing. At the 
recommended 150 mg q.o.d., very low pre-dose levels are observed at day 14 and 84 (<1% of Cmax). 
Considering the short elimination half-life, steady state is expected to be reached within a few days. 
Migalastat pharmacokinetics shows a moderate between-subject variability of about 25 – 35%. Intra-
subject variability was not evaluated. 
Migalastat pharmacokinetics between healthy subjects and Fabry patients are comparable. 
Dose and q.o.d. dosing scheme is recommended based on nonclinical studies demonstrating that, 
compared to daily administration, greater GL-3 reductions were observed using less-frequent dosing 
regimens, including an every other day regimen, and this was further confirmed in vivo (see clinical 
part).  
Distribution 
Migalastat does not bind to plasma proteins and as such, drug-drug interactions due to protein 
displacement are not expected with migalastat.  
Based upon limited animal data, migalastat is widely distributed to body tissues, it may cross the 
blood-brain barrier, and it may transfer over the placenta and may be excreted into milk.  
Patients with Fabry disease receiving migalastat showed increased α-gal A activity and/or substrate 
(GL-3) reduction in clinically relevant tissues, such as skin, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and 
kidney. The volume of distribution ( Vz ) of about 60 l indicates that it is larger than total body water 
(about 42 l for a 70 kg subject). 
Metabolism  
In vitro data show that migalastat is not a substrate of CYP enzymes. This is confirmed in vivo, 
showing that migalastat is not extensively metabolised.   
The major circulating component in plasma was migalastat, representing approximately 77% of the 
sample radioactivity. Other circulating components were formed by dehydrogenation followed by O-
glucuronidation (M1, M2 and M3). These metabolites were minor representing only approximately 5%, 
2% and 6% of the sample radioactivity, respectively. 
Elimination of migalastat in human following oral administration was mainly by direct renal excretion 
with approximately 55% of the administered dose detected as unchanged migalastat in urine. 
Metabolism via dehydrogenation and O-glucuronide conjugation was a minor route of elimination with 
metabolites representing approximately 4% of the dose in human urine. Total radioactivity recovery in 
urine was about 77%. A further 20% of the administered dose was detected as unchanged migalastat 
in faeces, which may represent unabsorbed migalastat or material either directly secreted in the bile or 
Galafold 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/669526/2015 
Page 33/110 
 
 
 
 
conjugated and then hydrolysed in the gastrointestinal tract. The total recovery of the radioactive dose 
was 97.6%. 
Urinary recovery of mainly the intact drug was confirmed in several other studies. 
Elimination 
The plasma elimination half-life of migalastat is about 3.5 – 4.5. CL after i.v. administration was about 
9.3 l/h. After oral administration at the 150 mg dose CL/F was about 11 – 14 l/h. Renal clearance was 
about 7 l/h, in line with the normal glomerular filtration rate of 6 l/h. 
Special patient groups 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis did not show a difference in migalastat clearance between male 
and female subjects and an effect of age on clearance. Further, based upon population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, no effect of race on the clearance of migalastat is observed. 
Body weight appeared to be a covariate for migalastat clearance. Patients with a low body weight are 
subject to a higher exposure, while patients with a large bodyweight are subject to a lower exposure 
(difference about 40%). This is considered however not clinically relevant. 
Migalastat is eliminated to a great extent renally as intact drug. As such, an impact of an impaired 
renal function on the pharmacokinetics of migalastat is expected. Indeed, a mild, moderate and severe 
impaired renal function increased systemic exposure 17%, 81% and 353%, respectively. 
Consequently, Galafold is not recommended for use in patients with Fabry disease who have estimated 
GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
No studies have been carried out in subjects with impaired hepatic function. From the metabolism and 
excretion pathways, it is not expected that a decreased hepatic function may affect the 
pharmacokinetics of migalastat.

PK Trials 
Interactions:  
In vitro, migalastat appeared not to be an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and 3A4.  
In vitro data show that migalastat is not a substrate of P-gp or CYP enzymes. Based upon in vivo data, 
migalastat is a substrate for uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), however this is only 
a minor elimination pathway. As such, it is not expected that migalastat inhibits UGT.  
In vitro, migalastat does not inhibit 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5 and appeared 
not to be an inhibitor of BCRP, MDR1 and BSEP human efflux transporters and OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K human uptake transporters. In vitro, migalastat is not 
a substrate of BCRP, MDR1, BSEP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K.  
In vitro migalastat appeared not to be an inhibitor of P-gp. 
Based upon the available in vitro data, no interactions are expected on CYP and transporters level.

In vivo, co-administration of migalastat with agalsidase resulted in increased exposures to agalsidase; 
at the 150 mg single dose level an increase of 2.0 to 4.2-fold is observed. Agalsidase did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of migalastat. This interaction is adequately described in the SmPC section 4.5.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of migalastat were investigated in five Phase II trials (see Table 
2). Results from the PD studies showed that migalastat increased α-Gal A activity in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and corresponding decreases in plasma GL-3 were observed in patients 
with migalastat-responsive mutations.  
Dose selection was based on findings from preclinical and PD studies, the optimal dosage was found to 
be 150 mg QOD. This was based on the optimal increase of α-Gal A activity in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and corresponding decreases in GL-3 (in urine, blood, skin etc.). Increases 
in PBMC α-Gal A activity and decreases in GL-3 observed with migalastat 150 mg QOD dose were not 
further enhanced when patients switched to higher, less frequent doses (250 and 500 mg, 3 days on/4 
days off; FAB-CL-205), supporting the selection of the 150 mg QOD regimen for study in Phase 3 
trials. Patients were selected based on GLA genotyping (by HEK analysis; discussed below) whether 
they had an amenable mutation or not.  
Fabry disease-causing GLA missense mutations, carboxyl-terminal nonsense mutations, small 
insertions and deletions that maintain reading frame, and complex mutations comprised of two or 
more of these types of mutations on a single GLA allele, generally qualify for in vitro testing. These 
types of mutations are generally associated with mutant forms that may be physically unstable, prone 
to inefficient or aberrant folding, have deficient lysosomal trafficking, and/or show increased levels in 
cultured cells upon binding and stabilization by migalastat (Lemansky et al., 1987; Ishii et al., 1993; 
Ishii, Kase et al., 1996; Ioannou et al., 1998;Fan 1999; Desnick et al., 2001; Garman and Garboczi 
2002; Bernier, Lagace et al., 2004; Desnick 2004; Garman and Garboczi 2004; Yam et al., 2005; Yam 
et al., 2006; Ishii et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2008; Benjamin et al., 2009). Thus, Fabry patients with 
these types of mutations may show increased total cellular α-Gal A activity after treatment with 
migalastat. This has been shown in the pivotal studies (AT1001-011 and AT1001-012) were increases 
in α-Gal A were observed after migalastat 150 mg QOD treatment. No changes in α-Gal A were 
observed after placebo treatment. In ERT treated patients α-Gal A could not be measured due to 
interference with the administered enzyme.GLA Genotype Testing used for Patient Identification 
The standard diagnostic for Fabry disease includes GLA genotyping to confirm the presence of a 
mutation. A GLA mutation that is predicted to be responsive to migalastat was a key eligibility criterion 
throughout the clinical development program. During Phase 2, an in vitro assay was developed in 
human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK) cells, which identifies mutant forms of α Gal A that are responsive 
to migalastat. In this assay, the mutant form of α-Gal A being tested is expressed in HEK cells, which 
are cultured in the absence and presence of migalastat. An increase in α-Gal A activity in the presence 
of migalastat indicates that the specific mutant form was stabilised by migalastat and trafficked into 
the lysosome. For Phase 3 enrolment, a preliminary HEK assay was used to identify patients with 
responsive mutations. The criteria for a mutation to be considered responsive were: a relative increase 
in α-Gal A activity ≥1.2-fold above baseline and an absolute increase in α Gal A activity ≥3% of wild-
type (WT) after incubation with 10 μM migalastat. The concentration of 10 µM is the approximate Cmax 
of migalastat in the plasma of patients with Fabry disease following a single oral dose of 150 mg 
Galafold

(Johnson et al., 2013). In patients with Fabry disease, α-Gal A increases of approximately 1 to 5% of 
normal activity in vivo are considered to be clinically meaningful (Desnick, 2004). A reference table 
that categorised GLA mutations, according to the preliminary HEK assay, was compiled and used to 
determine eligibility for the pivotal Phase 3 studies of migalastat.  
GLP HEK assay (a.k.a. migalastat amenability assay) 
During the conduct of the Phase 3 studies, the preliminary HEK assay (see above) was transferred to a 
qualified third-party laboratory, Cambridge Biomedical, for analytical and GLP validation. The GLP HEK 
assay was similar to the preliminary HEK assay, but included modifications to increase the level of 
quality control, rigor, precision, and consistency. After assay validation, the in vitro responses to 10 μM 
migalastat of the 531 known mutant forms of α-Gal A were re-tested in the GLP HEK assay, including 
those from all patients enrolled in the Phase 2 pharmacodynamic studies (FAB-CL-201 to FAB-CL-204) 
and the pivotal Phase 3 studies (AT1001-011 and AT1001-012). The criteria for amenability in this 
assay were the same as in the preliminary HEK assay (see above). 
For clinical validation of the GLP HEK assay, the mutant forms of α-Gal A categorised as amenable in 
the HEK assay were compared to the observed α-Gal A activity in PBMCs of male patients with Fabry 
disease (n=51) after migalastat treatment in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. These analyses showed a 
high degree of consistency between the two sets of results. The predictive values were estimated to 
be: 
  Sensitivity: 1.0 
  Specificity: 0.88 
  Positive predictive value: 0.95 
  Negative predictive value: 1.0 
Additional analyses of the Phase 3 clinical studies demonstrated that the GLP HEK assay results are 
highly predictive of changes in kidney IC GL-3 and plasma lyso-Gb3, which are considered biomarkers.  
The positive predictive value of the HEK assay on a patient level is 95% (i.e. some patients deteriorate 
during migalastat treatment due to non-amenability). This uncertainty necessitates a warning to be 
included in the SmPC with regards to the need of monitoring of treatment after 6 months and regularly 
thereafter. Further given a specificity of 88%, about 12% of the patients will be wrongly identified as 
non-amenable. It should be concluded that the HEK assay has its limitations in the identification of 
amenable and non-amenable patients. The HEK assay is acceptable as it identifies a population of 
amenable patients that would respond to migalastat treatment (see efficacy conclusions). 
The mutant forms of α-Gal A categorised as amenable in the HEK assay are also associated with 
corresponding changes in disease substrate in patients. High sensitivity and specificity were seen in the 
comparisons of α-Gal A activity in the HEK assay to reductions in male kidney IC GL-3 (sensitivity 1.0, 
specificity 1.0, positive predictive value 1.0, negative predictive value 1.0), male plasma lyso-Gb3 
(respectively: 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0), and male and female plasma lyso-Gb3 (respectively: 0.93, 0.69, 
0.84, 0.85).  
These results support the clinical validation of the GLP HEK assay and the utility of the 
pharmacogenetic reference table in identifying the target population for treatment with migalastat. 
The GLP HEK assay was based on the preliminary HEK assay, and included modifications to increase 
the level of quality control, rigor, precision, and consistency. Comparison of the results from the GLP 
HEK assay and the preliminary HEK assay showed that 475 of 531 (89%) mutations were maintained 
Galafold

in the same category, whereas 56 of 531 (11%) mutations changed categories after analytical 
validation. Mutations that do not meet the amenability criteria are referred to as non-amenable. 
Further the applicant considers mutations not tested non-amenable. To date, 850 GLA mutations have 
been categorised as either amenable (n=269) or non-amenable (n=581). Non-amenable mutations 
also include mutations that do not qualify for testing such as large deletions, insertions, truncations, 
frameshift mutations, and splice site mutations. These types of mutations often lead to the loss of 
entire protein domains that grossly alter the structure and function of the enzyme, and may even 
result in the complete loss of expression. Splice site mutations, in general, can lead to incorrect 
processing of mRNA precursors, including exon skipping or splicing at cryptic splice points, resulting in 
gross structural and functional alterations. Furthermore, splice site mutations are not testable in the 
GLP HEK assay because this assay uses recombinant GLA cDNA; thus, the mutant α-Gal A is expressed 
independent of pre-mRNA splicing. To date, 850 GLA mutations have been categorized as either 
amenable (n=269) or non-amenable (n=581). 
In the indication, it is stated that patients should be amenable to migalastat as follows: “Galafold is 
indicated for long-term treatment of adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older with a confirmed 
diagnosis of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency) and who have an amenable mutation (see list 
of mutations in section 5.1)” In section 5.1, two tables are included: one table including the GLA 
mutations that are amenable to migalastat and one table with the mutations that are considered not 
amenable to migalastat which include mutations not investigated yet. It is emphasized by the applicant 
that only mutations that were tested are included in one of the tables. 
Table 3 presents a summary of the patients in Phase 3 studies, overall and for those with amenable 
and non-amenable mutations.

a) ITT population; b) mITT population was defined as those patients having an amenable mutation to migalastat. 
The reference table (e.g. table with known mutations that are amenable or non-amenable to 
migalastat in vitro) will be updated by the applicant as new amenable mutations are identified. It is 
anticipated that on a yearly basis 30 to 40 new mutations will be identified. It is expected that as a 
result of registration this number will temporarily be higher and the SmPC will be updated regularly to 
reflect the scientific knowledge. 
Dose selection pharmacology studies 
  Study FAB-CL-201 
Study FAB-CL-201 was a dose-escalation study in which 9 adult male patients received oral migalastat 
25 mg BID, 100 mg BID, and 250 mg BID each for 2 weeks. At the end of the dose escalation phase, 
patients received 25 mg migalastat BID for 6 weeks after which they could enter an optional extension 
phase and receive 50 mg QD, giving a total treatment duration of up to 97 weeks in some patients. An 
additional 6 patients were dosed screen failures who received migalastat 150 mg QD for 2 weeks.  
  Study FAB-CL-202/ Study FAB-CL-203 
Galafold

In two other studies (FAB-CL-202 and FAB-CL-203) five and four male patients respectively were 
included to further investigate the optimal dosing regimen of migalastat 150 mg QOD. Patients 
received migalastat administered as a QOD regimen for either 12 or 24 weeks, followed by an optional 
extension phase, giving a cumulative treatment duration of 48 weeks. All male patients (18 to 65 
years) were hemizygous for Fabry and had to have residual α-Gal A activity. These patients are 
considered non-classic male Fabry patients.  
  Study FAB-CL-204 
Similar to study FAB-CL-201, nine female Fabry patients were enrolled in study FAB-CL-204. The 
female Fabry patients were heterozygous for Fabry and had to have residual α-Gal activity. Five of the 
9 female patients were amenable to migalastat. Additional post hoc analysis demonstrated that female 
subjects with amenable mutations demonstrate a response to migalastat in reduction of urine GL-3 and 
kidney IC GL-3, compared with subjects with non-amenable mutations. 
Patients in the PD studies were not stratified according to ERT exposure status. Post hoc analysis 
showed a consistent trend observed in patients with amenable mutations independent of the pre-
treatment with ERT. These results are in line with those reported in the phase 3 studies.  
In male Fabry patients, 25 mg, 100 mg, and 250 mg BID and 150 mg QOD migalastat increased 
leukocyte α-Gal A activity in almost all patients, even those with very low α-Gal A activity at baseline 
(studies FAB-CL-201 through FAB-CL-203). Decreases in urine GL-3 were seen in 3 male Fabry 
patients whose α-Gal A mutant forms were classified as amenable to migalastat based on the in vitro 
HEK assay (Study FAB-CL-202). Decreases in urine GL-3 were inconsistent in studies FAB-CL-201 and 
FAB-CL-203 in male Fabry patients. Renal interstitial capillary GL-3 in the last available biopsy (Week 
12, 24, or 48), scored histologically using the fully quantitative Barisoni method (Barisoni et al., 2012), 
tended to decrease relative to baseline in patients whose α-Gal A mutant forms were amenable to 
migalastat based on the in vitro HEK assay (Study FAB-CL-202 and FAB-CL-203). GFR, 24 hr urine 
protein excretion, 24 hr creatinine clearance was collected at baseline of all patients. All patients were 
considered having a (near) normal renal function. After treatment with migalastat no clinical 
meaningful differences were observed. Baseline cardiac MRIs were abnormal in most patients. After 
treatment some patients (16 had available data) showed improved LVEF and increase in LVESi. The 
data indicate that migalastat may have some beneficial effects on cardiac parameters. This should be 
confirmed in the phase III studies.  
In female Fabry patients treated with 50 mg (n=2), 150 mg (n=4), or 250 mg (n=3) migalastat 
QOD (Study FAB-CL-204), increases in leukocyte α-Gal A activity were seen in all patients by Week 24. 
At Week 48, eight of nine patients maintained this increase. Decreases in urine GL-3 were seen by 
Week 48 for seven of the nine patients. The earliest and most consistent declines in urine GL-3 were 
seen in the three patients who received 150 or 250 mg migalastat and whose α-Gal A mutant forms 
were amenable to migalastat based on the in vitro HEK assay. Renal interstitial capillary GL-3 in the 
last available biopsy (Week 48 or 12), scored histologically using the fully quantitative Barisoni method 
(Barisoni et al., 2012), decreased relative to baseline in six of the nine patients. Of the six female 
patients having an abnormal cardiac MRI three showed no improvement. The three others showed 
some improvement.  
  Study FAB-CL-205 
Study FAB-CL-205 is a Phase 2 open-label, non-comparative, long-term extension study in 23 
patients who transitioned from the completed studies FAB-CL-201 to FAB-CL-204. Depending on the 
protocol amendment in force at the time of enrolment, patients either started on migalastat 150 mg 
QOD then entered a dose-escalation period, or they directly entered the dose-escalation period. The 
dose-escalation period evaluated migalastat 250 mg and 500 mg given as a 3 days on/4 days off

regimen. Following safety and pharmacodynamic data review indicating that the 150 mg QOD regimen 
offered a more favourable benefit-risk profile, the protocol was amended and the majority of patients 
returned to migalastat 150 mg QOD. Data in male patients with an amenable mutation demonstrate 
that migalastat showed improvement in α-Gal A activity. In contrast in male patients with non-
amenable mutation no noteworthy increase in α-Gal A activity was observed. 
Of the 23 patients enrolled, 8 had paired kidney biopsy samples (baseline from their previous feeder 
study, Visit 8, and Visit 12) available for evaluation. For these 8 patients, a decline in IC GL-3 
inclusions was seen in the 5 patients in Visit 8 and 4 patients in Visit 12 with amenable mutations, and 
was variable in the 3 patients with non-amenable mutations.  
Due  to  the  limited  number  of  patients,  the  results  of  the  above  pharmacological  studies  lack  proper 
statistical  analysis.  No  clear  relationship  between  the  various  groups  (different  dosing  regimen, 
amenable/non-amenable patients) could therefore be demonstrated. However due to the nature of the 
disease this is acceptable. 
Based on the phase 2 studies, the 150 mg QOD dosing regimen was selected for the phase 3 studies. 
The  pharmacological  studies  showed  increases  in  α-Gal  A  activity  and  decreases  in  GL-3  with 
migalastat  150  mg  QOD.  These  parameters  were  not  further  enhanced  when  patients  switched  to 
higher, less frequent migalastat doses (250 mg and 500 mg, 3 days on/4 days off). Although the data 
are limited, clinical based justification was provided, concluding that the data support the selection of 
the 150 mg QOD regimen. 
Important biochemical parameters 
The focus of clinical assessment is based on the following of biochemical parameters as these that are 
considered of key importance for the efficacy outcome and clinically important to the Fabry patient. 
Alfa-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity 
Due to the mode of action of migalastat –(e.g. stabilization of the galactosidase enzyme) - increased 
activity  of the enzyme would confirm the mode of action. It should be noted that measurement of α-
Gal A activity is less relevant in women since  Fabry is a recessive X-linked disease. Women are 
heterozygotes, thus they have one intact gen copy left on X chromosome that expresses the α-Gal 
protein. 
Lyso-Gb3 
Lyso-Gb3 is a deacylated form of Gb3 which has been identified as a storage product in Fabry disease 
(Aerst, et al., 2008) and considered a sensitive marker (Rombach et al., 2010; Togawa et al., 2010). 
Of note, there are at least six other lyso-Gb3 analogues known at present. In plasma lyso-GB3 is the 
main isoform (Boutin et al., 2014). Plasma lyso-Gb3 in males is known to be higher than the plasma 
lyso-Gb3 concentrations in females Therefore, sensitive analysis is required to observe a small change 
of lyso-Gb3 in women.  
Based on plasma lyso-Gb3 concentration, Fabry patients can be divided in different Fabry phenotypes 
(Smid et al., 2015) as follows : Patients with classical Fabry disease (defined as males with lyso-Gb3 
about 50- 100 nmol/l) and females with  plasma lyso-Gb3 concentration about 0-20 nmol/l) (Lukas et 
al., 2013; Smid et al., 2015).  
At baseline, the patients in the placebo controlled study had a mean lyso-Gb3 level of 47.3 ± 62.2 
nmol/l in the treatment group and 41.9 ± 39.1 nmol/l in the placebo group. Given the large variation 
in the observed lyso-Gb3 levels, both individual and absolute (uncorrected) values are analysed to get 
complete information on the magnitude and of the effect and its variation. The results revealed that a 
Galafold 
Assessment report

considerable number of data points were not entered in the database but this was later corrected. 
Analysis of the data further support the observed decrease in lyso-Gb3 in patients treated with 
migalastat despite a considerable variability. 
GL-3 inclusions 
In Fabry disease, accumulation of GL-3 (also known as zebra-bodies) can be observed in all body 
tissues. In the placebo controlled study, renal biopsies are taken to investigate whether GL-3 inclusions 
are present in the interstitial capillaries to definitely confirm the diagnosis Fabry. At baseline, 30/34 
patients in the migalastat groups versus 30/33 patients in the placebo group had GL-3 inclusions in the 
kidney interstitial capillary (migalastat 0.922 ± 1.64 GL-3 inclusion per IC; placebo 0.645 ± 0.80 GL-3 
inclusions per IC). 7 patients were excluded since they did not have biopsies at both baseline and 
month 6. Additionally, a large variation in scoring GL-3 inclusions was observed between the different 
pathologists. Therefore, upon request, the applicant submitted intra- and inter-observer reliability 
data. However, when considering the intra- and inter-observer reliability, the applicant stated that 
most results are between 2SD. This is per definition true as ±2SD encompasses with 95.4% of the 
observations within the 2SD assuming a normal distribution. Further analysis applying Pearson’s 
correlation revealed an acceptable intra- and inter-observer reliability. 
eGFR 
In Fabry disease patients, renal function can deteriorate over time. Therefore, one of the treatment 
goals is the stabilization of renal function. GFR is used to estimate the renal function based on serum 
creatinine and depending on the formula used by weight or age and gender and race. The applicant 
used eGFRCKD-EPI and mGFRiohexol, and GFRmrd. eGFRCKD-EPI and mGFRiohexol are considered the best 
approach for calculation/estimation of GFR. 
eGFRCKD-EPI is calculated as GFR = 141 x min(Scr/κ, 1)α x max(Scr/κ, 1)-1.209 x 0.993Age x 
1.018 [if female] x 1.159 [if black], where Scr is serum creatinine, κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 
for males, α is -0.329 for females and - 0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/κ 
or 1, and max indicates the maximum of Scr/κ or 1. 
mGFRiohexol = measured glomerular filtration rate as assessed by plasma clearance of iohexol 
The eGFR is analyses in this assessment report, since it is currently considered the most sensitive 
estimation for the renal function. The above method however could provide  an over or under 
estimation of the GFR of about 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the ranges mentioned in the studies1.  
Baseline data from phase II and phase III studies indicate that the included Fabry patients (male and 
female) had a (near) normal renal function according to the stages of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). 
Patients had proteinuria to some extent, classifying them either stage 1 or 2.  
Cardiac parameters 
At baseline the majority of patients included in the study reported little cardiac problems in terms of 
LVMi which was considered to be in the upper normal ranges. However, some patients had abnormal 
LVMi and/or LVH at baseline.  
Repeated measurements of the LVMi in non Fabry patients showed a variability of about 0.3 g/m2 for 
the same investigator and the observed intra-reader variation is considered to be between 4.5 and 6.3 
g/m2 2.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In the four phase II studies FAB-CL-201 to FAB-CL-204 , 18 males and 9 female Fabry patients were 
included. Study FAB-CL-205 was an extended open label (OLE) study that included 23 patients (14 
males/9 females) from FAB-CL-201 to 204.  
Based on the inclusion criteria and baseline α-Gal A activity, the included patients are considered to be  
Fabry disease patients. All patients had residual α-GAL A activity, except for one patient in study FAB-
CL-201 who had zero activity. In addition all patients had lyso-Gb3 concentrations that where below 
the cut-off lyso-Gb3 value for classical Fabry disease (e.g. 50-100 nmol/L) for male patients and for 
classical female patients (0 - 20 nmol/L). The mean renal function was (near) normal renal function 
(for age), e.g. eGFR ≈90 ml/min/1.73 m2 on a group level. Notwithstanding the near normal mean 
value, some of the patients (9/27) included in the PD studies had mild to severe renal insufficiency 
(GFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2) andall patients had proteinuria. Most patients (10/18 males and 6/9 
females) had an abnormal cardiac MRI at baseline.  
In summary, this  indicated that, within the PD studies, a considerable number of patients had a 
disease burden considered to be in line with the disease spectrum observed in the general Fabry 
population. 
In general, protocol deviations were rather high and raised concerns. The high number of deviations 
were caused by the reporting of each missing lab value due to missed visits as a separate deviation. 
However, this type of deviation should not affect results of studies, which was considered reassuring 
and finally acceptable.  
Patients were selected to be responsive to migalastat in patient-derived lymphocytes (test for α-GAL A 
activity). If the HEK assay demonstrated increased α-Gal A activity (i.e. a relative increase in α-Gal A 
activity ≥1.2-fold above baseline and an absolute increase in α-Gal A activity ≥3% of wild-type (WT) 
after incubation with 10 µM migalastat), patients were considered to be responder (or defined as  
amenable) to migalastat and then included in the study.  
In the open label extension study FAB-CL-205, urine levels of GL-3 were decreasing for several weeks 
in treatment-responsive subjects. Nevertheless, the same trend as in previous studies was observed  
as  the GL-3 levels started to rise in final week of study. However, this was mainly driven by the value 
of one patient (GFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
A range of doses and regimens were explored in 27 subjects (18 males and 9 females): twice daily 
(25, 100, 250 mg), per day (50 mg), QOD (50,150, 250 mg), and 3 days on-4 days off (250, 500 mg). 
Generally, it appears that doses above 150 mg did not show any additional effect; however no formal 
analysis across studies was provided by the applicant. This approach could be acceptable considering 
the small number of patients included in phase II studies. In addition, results from Phase III studies 
further confirmed the efficacy and safety profile of 150 mg dose of migalastat. 
After treatment with migalastat, the majority of patients considered amenable to migalastat showed an 
increased α-Gal A activity and a decrease in urine GL-3 after 48 weeks of treatment. Some of the 
patients showed improved of cardiac anatomy (e.g. LVMi, LVH).  
In contrast, patients considered non-responders did not show any improvement of clinical significance 
for above parameters. No additional beneficial effects were observed when dosing migalastat in dosage 
of 250 or 500 mg.  
The applicant demonstrated that the GLP HEK assay results are predictive in selecting patients with 
amenable mutations (i.e. responder to migalastat), based on the data from the Phase 3 clinical 
studies. The mutant forms of α-Gal A categorised as amenable in the HEK assay are also associated 
Galafold 
Assessment report

with corresponding improvements in disease substrate in patients. High sensitivity and specificity were 
seen in the comparisons of α-Gal A activity in the HEK assay to reductions in male kidney IC GL-3 
(sensitivity 1.0, specificity 1.0, positive predictive value 1.0, negative predictive value 1.0), male 
plasma lyso-Gb3 (respectively: 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0), and male and female plasma lyso-Gb3 
(respectively: 0.93, 0.69, 0.84, 0.85).  
269 mutations are amenable to migalastat to date. The applicant agreed to include the reference 
tables listing all amenable and non amenable mutations tested and reviewed by the CHMP in SmPC 
section 5.1. The reference tables in SmPC section 5.1 will also be published on a specific website 
managed by the applicant. Considering the high number of mutations, from a clinical perspective, a 
reference to a website including a search tool is considered very helpful, in support of the SmPC 
information to allow Health Care Providers to search for the patient mutation and find out whether a 
specific GLA mutation has been classified as amenable to treatment with migalastat. From a legal and 
regulatory perspective, the principle of a website to provide the list of amenable and non amenable 
mutations listed in the latest approved SmPC with a search tool is considered to be acceptable, 
provided that the website will only duplicate information already present in the SmPC and that no 
promotional content should be provided in the website. (see discussion later in the report)  
As new mutations are tested, a variation will be submitted to CHMP for review and update of the tables 
listed in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Following approval, the website will be updated. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The mode of action of migalastat enabling galactosidase to be partially functional in the lysosome has 
been demonstrated. 
Patients included in the pharmacologic studies encompassed the whole spectrum of Fabry disease 
(classic and non-classical). Results from the PD studies showed that migalastat increased α-Gal A 
activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and corresponding decreases in plasma GL-3 
were observed in patients with migalastat-responsive mutations. 
Mean renal function was near normal at baseline with some patients suffering from mild to severe 
renal insufficiency. Migalastat did not show improvements of renal function expressed as an increase of 
eGFR.  
Based on the phase 2 studies migalastat 150 mg QOD was chosen as the optimum dosage for which an 
increase of α-GAL A activity and reduction of GL-3 was optimal and as such this dosage was considered 
to be an acceptable dose regimen to be evaluated in the phase 3 clinical program.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The phase 2 open label studies FAB-CL-201 to FAB-CL-204 were conducted in 27 patients (9 female 
and 18 male patients) with Fabry disease, all of whom received migalastat. In phase 2 study FAB-CL-
205 14 males and 9 females Fabry patients were included. These studies are discussed in the clinical 
pharmacology section. 
Based on these studies migalastat 150 mg QOD was chosen as the optimum dosage for which an 
increase of α-GAL A activity and reduction of GL-3 was optimal.  
One open-label Phase 2 study (AT1001-013) was performed in 20 patients with Fabry disease that 
received migalastat co-administered with agalsidase. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
interaction between migalastat and agalsidase. This study is discussed in the pharmacokinetic part of 
this report as clinical efficacy was not studied only the increase of enzyme activity in WBC. 
 It is noted that migalastat is not intended for concomitant use with ERT and the applicant is 
considering performing a phase 2 repeated dose study co-administering migalastat with ERT. This 
might be a valuable treatment option in patients that are considered non-amenable to migalastat and 
those that have a marginal response to ERT, therefore, such study is encouraged.  
Efficacy of migalastat was investigated in two pivotal studies (AT1001-011 and AT1001-012) in 124 
patients with Fabry disease, of whom 70 received migalastat, 24 received active comparator (15 of 
whom later received migalastat), and 33 received placebo (30 of whom later received migalastat). Two 
Phase 3, non-comparative, open-label, long-term extension studies (AT1001-041, AT1001-042), in 
which 67 patients received migalastat in AT1001-041 and 17 patients received migalastat in AT1001-
042 as of 13 October 2014. Study AT1001-042 is an ongoing study in which all patients will be enrolled 
from study AT1001-012 or AT1001-041. The last patient is expected to be enrolled into study AT1001-
042 in the first quarter of 2016. The study reports of AT1001-041 and AT1001-042 are not included in 
the dossier. However relevant safety data and data on renal and cardiac efficacy at 30-months were 
included in the application . This will be sufficient for further assessment of maintenance. However the 
final study reports should be submitted upon completion.

2.5.2.1.  Study AT1001-011 (Placebo controlled) 
Title : A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and 
Pharmacodynamics of migalastat in Patients with Fabry Disease and AT1001-Responsive GLA 
Mutations. 
Methods 
Study AT1001-011 consisted of two stages and a 12 month open-label extension (Figure 3). Stage 1 
consisted of Screening (up to 2 months) and a 6-month, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 
treatment period that compared the safety and PD of migalastat versus placebo in migalastat-
responsive patients with Fabry disease who were ERT-naïve or had not received ERT for at least the 
6 months before Screening. Patients were randomised in equal proportions to receive either oral 
migalastat (administered at 150 mg QOD) or matching placebo. Randomisation was stratified by sex.  
Figure 3: 
AT1001-011: Study Design 
• 
Study participants  
The most important inclusion criteria were: confirmed diagnosis of Fabry Disease, patients over 16 
years of age; naïve to ERT or had not received ERT for at least the 6 months before Screening; a 
confirmed GLA mutation shown to be responsive to migalastat in the HEK-assay; Urine GL-3 ≥4 times 
the upper limit of normal (ULN) at Screening. The diagnosis algorithm was not part of the study 
protocol therefore diagnosis should be further justified in some patients

Treatments 
Migalastat (150 mg QOD) taken orally in 150-mg capsules. 
Placebo QOD taken orally in matching capsules.  
Duration of Treatment 
Study AT1001-011 consisted of two stages (figure 2 above):  
  Stage 1: 6-month double-blind

  Stage 2: 6-months open label part  
  Open label extension part: 12 months  
• 
Objectives 
The primary objective in Stage 1 was to compare the effect of migalastat versus placebo on kidney GL-
3 inclusions assessed by histological scoring of the number of GL-3 inclusions per interstitial capillary 
(IC). 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients (ITT population) with a ≥50% reduction from 
baseline to month 6 in the average number of GL-3 inclusions per IC; secondary endpoints were the 
percent change from baseline in GL-3 inclusions per IC and percent ICs with zero GL-3 inclusions. 
Other secondary endpoints included urine GL-3; eGFRCKD-EPI, mGFRiohexol; eGFRMDRD; and 24-h urine 
protein, albumin, and creatinine. Cardiac parameters were assessed by echocardiography (ECHO). 
Patient-reported outcomes for quality of life, pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using 
the SF-36v2, the Brief Pain Inventory short form (severity component; BPI), and the Gastrointestinal 
Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS).  
In Stage 2, all patients received migalastat 150 mg QOD for up to 6 months. Patients who received 
placebo during Stage 1 were switched to migalastat (placebo-migalastat group) and patients who 
received migalastat during Stage 1 continued on migalastat (migalastat-migalastat group). Patients 
completing both Stage 1 and Stage 2 were eligible to participate in a 12-month, open-label migalastat 
extension phase (study AT1001-041). The efficacy endpoints evaluated for Stage 2 and the open-label 
extension included eGFRCKD-EPI, mGFRiohexol, eGFRMDRD, LVMi, SF-36v2, BPI short form, GSRS, mean 
number of GL-3 inclusions per IC (Stage 2), and plasma lyso-Gb3.  
  Sample size/randomisation 
A total of 180 patients consented to participate and 67 patients (ITT population) were randomised in 
study AT1001-011. Thirty-four patients were randomised to migalastat (12 males and 22 females; 
mean age of 40.0 ± 13.3 years) in Stage 1, and 33 were randomised to receive placebo (12 males and 
21 female patients; mean age of 44.5 ± 10.2 years).  
• 
Statistical methods 
The statistical analyses were based on the Stage 1 SAP, the Stage 2 SAP, and the Plasma Lyso-Gb3 
Exploratory Endpoint SAP. The Stage 2 SAP was finalized prior to receipt of the Stage 2 and open-label 
extension datasets. The Stage 2 SAP included post hoc analyses of Stage 1 data and prespecified 
analyses of Stage 2 and open-label extension data. 
Analysis Populations–Stage 1 SAP 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population included all randomized patients. The Modified Intent-to-Treat 
(mITT) Population included all randomized patients who had received at least 1 dose of study drug and 
underwent a renal biopsy at both Baseline (Visit 1) and Month 6 (Visit 4). The Per Protocol (PP) 
Population included all randomized patients who had received at least 1 dose of study drug, had both 
the Baseline (Visit 1) and Month 6 (Visit 4) kidney biopsy performed, and had no major protocol 
violations. The Safety Population included all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug. 
Analysis Populations–Stage 2 SAP 
In addition to the mITT, ITT, and Safety Populations, the analysis populations specified in the Stage 2 
SAP included the Stage 2 Population and the Open-Label Extension Population. The Stage 2 Population 
Galafold 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/669526/2015 
Page 45/110 
 
 
 
 
included all randomized patients who completed Stage 1 and continued in the study for Stage 2. The 
Open-Label Extension Population included all randomized patients who completed Stage 2 and 
continued in the open-label extension. 
The primary endpoint analysis for Stage 1 compared the proportion of successes (i.e., percentage of  
patients with a ≥ 50% reduction from Baseline [Visit 1] to Month 6 [Visit 4] in the average number of 
IC GL-3 inclusions) in each treatment group using the exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by 
sex. A p-value < 0.05 (2-sided) was required to conclude a statistically significant treatment effect. 
The frequency and percentage of successes for each group were calculated and presented. 
The superiority design is acceptable and based on results known from patients with “classical” Fabry 
disease this is acceptable. As the included patients are considered atypical patients the beneficial effect 
to be expected might be lower. As no formal study size calculation is made in these rare disease, there 
might be an increased risk of a type II error. 
  Results  
Baseline data/number analysed 
A total of 64 patients completed Stage 1: 34 in the migalastat group and 30 in the placebo group; 63 
of the 64 entered Stage 2 (33 patients in the migalastat-migalastat group and 30 patients in the 
placebo-migalastat group).  
A total of 31 patients in the migalastat-migalastat group and 29 patients in the placebo-migalastat 
group completed Stage 2. Of the patients who completed Stage 2, 29 in the migalastat-migalastat 
group and 28 in the placebo-migalastat group entered the open-label extension. Two patients in the 
migalastat-migalastat group discontinued during the open-label extension (one due to pregnancy, and 
one who was lost to follow-up); one patient in the placebo-migalastat group withdrew consent. Study 
drug compliance was high (98 to 99%) and similar between treatment groups in all stages of the 
study.  
The two groups were comparable with respect to baseline disease characteristics (seeTable 4). A total 
of 17/67 (25.4%) of patients had previously been treated with ERT and 19/67 were receiving ACEIs, 
ARBs, or RIs at baseline (6/34 of the migalastat group and 13/33 of the placebo group). An additional 
post hoc analysis was submitted further elucidating the baseline disease severity. Of the patients 
included in study 011 46 out of 67 patients (60%) had more than 2 organ systems involved at the 
start of treatment (i.e. migalastat).  
The  applicant  provided  the  individual  patient  data  (disease  symptoms,  lyso-Gb3,  LVMi,  eGFR,  GLA 
mutation  α-Gal  A  activity).  No  baseline  plasma  GL3  was  provided  by  the  applicant.  Baseline  α-Gal  A 
activity in males migalastat (n=9) 1.4 ± 3.1 nmol/h/mg and placebo (n=9) 0.5 ± 0.5 nmol/h/mg. The 
individual  patient  data  (amenable  patients  only)  was  used  to  confirm  the  diagnosis  and  treatment 
eligibility  conform  the  requirements  as  published  by  Biegstraaten  et  al.  (2015).  According  to  the 
publication of Smid3. the gold standard is a biopsy demonstrating GL-3 inclusions (zebra bodies) in the 
cell. In study 011, 60/67 patients in the ITT population (mITT 45/50 patients) had a renal biopsy and 
average  number  of  GL-3  inclusions  per  IC  varied  from  0.02  to  5.96  (min,  max),  confirming  the 
diagnosis of FD in these patients. For all patients the diagnosis could be confirmed. 
Analysis  of  the  database  for  study  011,showed  that  for  eGFR,  LVMi,  the  various  time  points  were 
adequately  entered.  For  lyso-Gb3,  the  data  points  were  less  complete.  This  is  due  to  the  addition  of 
lyso-Gb3 as important endpoint during the study and before data lock point.

The applicant diagnosed 14 male patients in this study as having classic Fabry disease. For further 
details, please refer to paragraph Clinical studies in special populations (subparagraph Male patients 
with classical FD).  
The mean eGFRCKD-EPI at baseline was 94.6 ml/min/1.73 m2 (95.4 in the migalastat group and 93.8 in 
the placebo group) which are considered to be normal GFR values. Based on urine protein:creatinine 
ratio (migalastat 31.9 ± 44.2 mg/mmol; placebo 41.4 ± 55.1 mg/mmol) it may be concluded that 
these patients are considered to have normal renal function but with proteinuria (CKD stage 1 or 2 
(The Renal Association)). This is also reflected by the fact that 19/67 patients received concomitant 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI); angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or a renin inhibitor 
(RI).

24-hour urine collection start and stop times were recorded. If collection times were less than or greater than 24 hours, urine 
parameters were standardized to a 24-hour collection period as per the SAP. 
Urine albumin:creatinine ratio is calculated as mg of albumin per 24-hour urine collection/mmol creatinine per 24-hour urine 
collection. 
  Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  in  Stage  1  (month  6)  was  the  kidney  IC  GL-3  responder  analysis  (defined  as 
≥50%  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  average  number  of  GL-3  inclusions  per  IC).  In  all  randomised 
patients (ITT), a response was seen in 13/34 of patients in the migalastat group and 9/33 of patients 
Galafold 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/669526/2015 
Page 47/110 
 
 
 
 
 
in the placebo group (p=0.3), indicating that most patients did not achieve the >50% reduction from 
baseline. Based on the responder analysis, it is concluded that the primary endpoint has not been met.   
The mean percent change in the average number of GL-3 inclusions per IC in the ITT population was -
8.0 ± 105.3 for migalastat versus 13.0 ± 90.5 for placebo (p=0.097). 
For measurement of GL-3 inclusions in the kidney interstitial capillaries each patient had a kidney 
biopsy performed at baseline, at month 6 and month 12. Two pathologists scored total GL-3 inclusions 
per 300 interstitial capillaries from which the mean was calculated. According to the MAH, reduction in 
kidney IC GL-3 is a recognised treatment outcome and was the basis for initial approval of Fabrazyme 
(Eng et al., 2001). It was noticed that there was high variability in scoring of GL-3 inclusions by the 
observers. Considering the intra and inter observer reliability, it was stated that most results are 
between 2SD. This is per definition true, as ±2SD encompasses 95.4% of the observations assuming a 
normal distribution. Based on this information, no conclusions on reproducibility can be drawn.  
  Secondary endpoints 
GL-3 Inclusions per Kidney Interstitial Capillary - Change from baseline. 
A post hoc analysis of Stage 1 results was performed in the 50/67 patients with amenable mutations. 
The change from baseline analysis demonstrated that 6 months treatment with migalastat was 
associated with a greater reduction in the average number of GL-3 inclusions per IC that was 
statistically significant compared to placebo: -0.250±0.103 versus +0.071±0.126, respectively; 
p=0.008; shown below in Figure 4. Based on literature, a qualitative correlation between GL-3 
inclusions and clinical outcome can be assumed. However, a quantitative relation cannot be 
established. Therefore, the GL-3 inclusions in renal tissue cannot be used for the prediction of the 
clinical benefit of migalastat. 
Figure 4: AT1001-011: Change from Baseline in the Mean Number of GL-3 Inclusions per 
Kidney Interstitial Capillary 
1 Data points (mean±SEM) are baseline-corrected data from mITT patients with amenable mutations (mITT-amenable population) 
and show the change in the mean number of GL-3 inclusions per interstitial capillary. The change is from baseline for the 
migalastat-migalastat group; the change is from Month 6 for the placebo-migalastat group.  
2 The statistical analysis of results at Month 6 used an ANCOVA model with covariate adjustment for baseline and factors for 
treatment group and treatment by baseline interaction. The p-value shown is for the least squares mean difference between the 
migalastat-migalastat group and the placebo-migalastat group. 
3 The analysis for the placebo-migalastat group of change from Month 6 to Month 12 used a mixed-models repeated measures 
analysis of the mITT-amenable population. Results are post hoc at Month 6 and pre-specified at Month 12. Changes from baseline to 
Month 6 and from Month 6 to Month 12 are based on paired readings.

In patients switching from placebo to migalastat in Stage 2 (the placebo-migalastat group, mITT), a 
statistically significant reduction in the mean number of GL 3 inclusions per IC (± SEM) was observed 
(0.330±0.152; p=0.014), thus replicating the IC GL-3 reduction seen in the cohort who received 
migalastat in Stage 1 (Figure 4). The reduction in the mean number of GL 3 inclusions per IC remained 
stable in the migalastat-migalastat group (patients who had received migalastat in Stage 1 followed by 
an additional 6-month treatment with migalastat in Stage 2). After 6 months of treatment with 
migalastat no further improvement of GL-3 inclusions could be observed.  
Though a tertiary endpoint the least squares mean difference for the change in percentage of kidney IC 
with zero GL-3 inclusions was 7.3%, in favour of migalastat versus placebo (p=0.042). In patients with 
non-amenable mutations, no difference between migalastat and placebo in the mean number of GL-3 
inclusions was observed.  
Plasma Lyso-Gb3 
Plasma lyso-Gb3 at baseline was 47.3 ± 62.2 nmol/l in the migalastat group and 41.8 ± 39.1 nmol/l in 
placebo group. After 6 months of treatment, the lyso-Gb3 concentration in the migalastat group was 
36.1 ± 45.9 nmol/l in the placebo group this was 42.2 ± 43.1 nmol/l (Figure 5). The reduction in 
plasma lyso-Gb3 was maintained when patients randomised to migalastat in Stage 1 continued for an 
additional 6 months of migalastat treatment in Stage 2. The patients switching from placebo to 
migalastat in Stage 2, followed a similar trend as observed for the patients on migalastat in stage 1.

included adjustment for baseline lyso-GB3 and factors for treatment group and treatment by baseline interactions. P-values 
correspond to least squares mean differences between migalastat and placebo. 
In study 011, male patients with multi-organ failure at baseline higher lyso-Gb3 levels (n=5; 136.6 ± 
50.15 nmol/l) compared to male patients who did not have multi-organ failure (n=13; 12.9 ± 5.71 
nmol/l) were observed. As expected the reduction of lyso-Gb3 level was more pronounced in male 
patients with multi-organ failure (-29.4% versus -8.1%). Similar trend was observed when patients 
previously on placebo were included in the analysis (open label part of study 011). 
Taking the renal severity into account, no conclusion can be drawn due to the limited numbers. 
Numerically, migalastat showed larger reduction of lyso-Gb3 over placebo. Similar results were seen

when stratified by male and female patients with baseline plasma lyso-Gb3 levels for Males > 51 
nmol/L + Females > 1.19 nmol/L versus Males < 51 nmol/L + Females < 1.19 nmol/L (thresholds for 
male classic FD and female FD patients (Smid et al., 2015)). 
Renal Function 
Baseline eGFRCKD-EPI values were migalastat group 95.4 ± 28.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 and placebo 93.8 ± 
20.6 ml/min/1.73 m2. These are considered normal values for age. 
After 6 months of treatment with migalastat 150 mg QOD eGFR values increased (1.8 ± 2.3 
ml/min/1.73 m2) whereas in the placebo treated group eGFR declined (-0.3 ± 7.5 (ml/min/1.73 m2).  
Analysis of the GFR results in Stage 2 of AT1001-011 showed that renal function remained stable over 
18 to 24 months of migalastat treatment (24 months in the patients treated with migalastat in Stage 
1, 18 months in the patients treated with placebo in Stage 1).  
These results, across all three methodologies used, demonstrate stabilisation of renal function in 
migalastat-treated patients. The change in renal function in migalastat-treated patients is comparable 
to the annual decline in renal function in healthy adults, [a change in eGFR of -1 mL/min/1.73 m2/year 
(Stevens et al., 2006)]. The data also suggests that renal function remains stable up to 36 months.  
A comprehensive survey of published reports of renal function in untreated patients with Fabry disease 
revealed annual changes in eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) between -2.2 and -12.2 (Eng et al., 2001; 
Schiffmann et al., 2001; Branton et al., 2002; Schwarting et al., 2006; Tahir et al., 2007; Tennankore 
et al., 2007; Schiffmann et al., 2009; West et al., 2009; Wanner et al., 2010).

The long-term effect of migalastat on renal function was assessed by evaluating annualised change in 
eGFRCKD-EPI in patients who continued from AT1001-011 into extension study AT1001-041. In these 
patients, eGFRCKD-EPI remained stable over an average of 38 months (minimum 18 months, maximum 
55 months (n=1)). The annualised rate of change over this period was -0.77 (95% CI: -1.94, 0.39) 
mL/min/1.73 m2/year. Post hoc data showed similar trend for the subgroups of patients with ≥2 organ 
systems (n=36; -0.8 ± 3.8) involved and patients with mutations associated with classic phenotype 
(n=24; -0.6 ± 4.5). Further analysis indicated also that the GFR remained stable independent of the 
renal function at baseline, age and gender.  
Cardiac parameters 
LVMi 
Baseline LVMi values in the migalastat group (n=30) was 91.7 ± 28.0 g/m2 and placebo (n=29) was 
97.7 ± 32.2 g/m2. These are considered normal values for age (Cain et al., 2009). The long-term 
Galafold 
Assessment report

effect of migalastat on cardiac parameters was assessed by evaluating LVMi in patients who continued 
from AT1001-011 into extension study AT1001-041 (36 months in the patients treated with migalastat 
in AT1001-011 Stage 1, and 30 months in the patients initially treated with placebo in AT1001-011 
Stage 1). These patients demonstrated further reductions in LVMi up to Month 30/36, beyond the 
effect seen at Month 18/24 (Table 6). This reduction was larger in patients with LVH at baseline.  Post 
hoc data showed similar trend for the subgroups of patients with ≥2 organ systems (n=4; -30.0 ± 
17.5) involved and patients with mutations associated with classic phenotype (n=2; -21.9 ± 4.2).  
Table 6: LVMi (g/m2) Change from Baseline up to Month 30/36 after Migalastat Treatment 
in Studies AT1001-011 and AT1001-041. 
Additional data were submitted for LVMi during the assessment and showed that mean changes from 
baseline after 42 to 48 months of migalastat treatment were -12.2 g/m2 (95% CI: -28.1, 3.6) (n=12) 
in all patients and -35.1g/m2 (95% CI: -86.8, 16.6) (n=3) in patients with LVH at baseline.  
Further, the descriptive statistics suggest a stronger effect in male patients compared to female, 
younger patients appear to be showing more improvement than elderly patients. However, there are 
largehe variability, prohibiting any definite conclusions. 
Other cardiac parameters 
Regarding other cardiac parameters based on echocardiography like in study AT1001-012, LV ejection 
fraction, fractional shortening, systolic and diastolic functional grades were generally normal at 
baseline and no clinical significant changes were noted.  
Gastrointestinal Symptoms (GSRS) 
The GSRS was assessed in AT1001-011 but not in AT1001-012. The GSRS outcomes in AT1001-011 
indicate the benefit of migalastat in improving the gastrointestinal symptoms in Fabry disease (

White blood cell α-Gal A Activity 
In AT1001-011, among males with amenable mutations, increases of ~2.6 nmol/h/mg in α-Gal A 
activity were maintained through Month 24. As expected, PBMC α-Gal A activity did not change for 
male patients with non-amenable mutations throughout the study. 
Patient-Reported Outcomes (SF-36v2 and BPI) 
In the AT1001-011, comparison of migalastat and placebo in the SF-36v2, for patients with amenable 
mutations and abnormal baseline values, numerical improvements were found across the study (24 
months of treatment for the migalastat-migalastat group and 18 months of treatment for the placebo-
migalastat group) for the vitality subscale (mean increase: 4.0) and the general health domain (mean 
increase: 4.5). 
2.5.2.2.  Study AT1001-012 
Title : A Randomized, Open-Label Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of migalastat and Enzyme 
Replacement Therapy (ERT) in Patients With Fabry Disease and migalastat-Responsive GLA Mutations, 
Who Were Previously Treated With ERT. 
Methods 
Study AT1001-012 is an active-controlled, randomised, open-label multinational study for which the 
applicant has received SA. The study was designed to only compare the efficacy and safety of oral 
migalastat to intravenous ERT in patients with Fabry disease who were receiving ERT prior to study 
entry and who had migalastat-responsive GLA mutations(.. The study was not powered to demonstrate 
non inferiority, e.g. normal statistics were used. Strictly spoken, the study is considered a “randomised

stop study” in which patients quit ERT treatment and start with a new intervention in this case oral 
migalastat.  
The applicant received SA on the conduct of the study (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/540686/2008). The CHMP 
agreed with the applicant that due to small number of available patients it would be difficult to recruit 
treatment naïve patients. The use of both Replagal (agalsidase α) and Fabrazyme (agalsidase ß) as 
comparative ERT was agreed upon. Although it would have been preferable to have only one active 
comparator, this would have reduced the number of patients to be included. The study was structured 
in two periods (Figure 6). The first period was an 18-month open-label treatment in which ERT-
experienced patients were randomised 1.5:1 to switch from ERT to migalastat (150 mg QOD) or 
continue with ERT. Randomisation was stratified by sex and proteinuria (<100 mg/24 h; 
≥100 mg/24 h). The second period is a 12-month open-label extension that is currently ongoing. 
Patients who received migalastat during the first period continued to receive migalastat in this 
extension. Patients who received ERT during the first period discontinued ERT and switched to 
migalastat.

• 
Study participants  
Most important inclusion criteria were: patients with confirmed Fabry disease over 16 years of age; 
ERT treatment initiated at least 12 months prior visit 2; a confirmed GLA mutation shown to be 
responsive to migalastat in the HEK-assay; Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73 
m2.Diagnosis was made by the treating physician and was considered plausible based on the available 
information in the dossier. In addition, it was demonstrated that that all patients were eligible for 
treatment in accordance with the recent treatment guideline (Biegstraaten et al., 2015).   
• 
Treatments/duration of treatment 
The ERT used as active controls were agalsidase alfa (Replagal) and agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme). 
Throughout the course of this study, commercially available agalsidase for intravenous infusions was 
prescribed by the patient’s treating physician and was administered in accordance with the approved 
prescribing information. 
 Patients were enrolled in period 1 of the study receiving either migalastat or ERT for 18 months. After 
finalising period 1, patients could continue in the extended phase (period 2) for an additional 12 
months.

• 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety migalastat to ERT in 
patients with Fabry disease who were currently receiving ERT and who had migalastat-responsive 
mutations in GLA, the gene that encodes α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). 
• 
Sample size 
Approximately 50 patients were planned to be enrolled. A total of 68 patients consented to participate, 
and 60 patients were randomized. Of these patients, 36 were randomized to the migalastat group, and 
24 were randomized to the ERT group. Efficacy was analysed in the modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) 
Population, which consisted of 52 patients; safety was analysed in the Safety Population (all patients 
who received at least 1 dose of study drug), which consisted of 57 patients. 
• 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomized in a 1.5:1 ration to either to ERT treatment and start treatment with 
migalastat or to continue on ERT. Randomization was stratified by sex and proteinuria (<100 mg/24 h; 
≥100 mg/24 h). 
• 
Statistical methods 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population included all randomized patients. The mITT Population included all 
randomized patients with mutations amenable to migalastat in the validated Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) HEK assay that received at least 1 dose of study drug and had both the baseline and a post 
baseline efficacy measure of mGFRiohexol and a post baseline measure of eGFRCKD-EPI. Efficacy analyses 
were performed using the mITT Population. Each patient was analysed according to his or her original 
randomized treatment group.  
The Per Protocol (PP) Population included all patients in the mITT Population who completed the 18-
month randomized treatment period and did not have the following protocol violation: change in the 
use of ACEIs, ARBs, or renin inhibitors (RIs) during the 18-month treatment period. Analyses using the 
PP Population analysed patients according to the actual treatment received. The Safety Population 
included all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of migalastat or ERT. All safety analyses 
were performed using the Safety Population and analysed patients according to the actual treatment 
received. 
The use of a non-inferiority design for the comparative study was discussed during  scientific advice 
(EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/540868/2008), CHMP was in the view that descriptive statistics could only be 
accepted if an active control and a historical comparison with placebo regarding clinical endpoints if the 
study duration would be sufficiently long. No historical control data in atypical Fabry patients was 
submitted. The proposed study is considered a “randomized stop-study”, in which patients are 
switched from ERT to migalastat without a period of being untreated. So it will be difficult by definition 
to demonstrate clinical significant differences between the two interventions. Due to the lack of a 
placebo arm in this study the through effect of migalastat on GFR, LVMi and other parameters cannot 
be concluded. The mITT Population included all randomized patients with mutations amenable to 
migalastat in the validated Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) HEK assay that received at least 1 dose of 
study drug and had both the baseline and a post baseline efficacy measure of mGFRiohexol and a post 
baseline measure of eGFRCKD-EPI. Efficacy analyses were performed using the mITT Population. 
Both treatments were declared comparable as a >50% overlap of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
and a difference of least squares (LS) mean annualized rate of change no greater than 2.2 
mL/min/1.73 m2 between the 2 treatment groups could be demonstrated.

Outcomes and estimation 
Annualized Change in GFR (Primary Efficacy Parameters) 
The primary efficacy parameters were the annualized rates of change in both eGFRCKD-EPI and 
mGFRiohexol. 
The CKD-EPI based on cystatin C alone underestimates GFR, whereas the CKD-EPI formula based on 
creatinine alone overestimates GFR in comparison to mGFR. The combination of the two markers into 
the same formula gives the most accurate estimate of mGFR. Therefore, the CHMP proposed to use the 
CKD-EPI formula based on creatinine and cystatin C serum markers as an additional secondary end 
point.  
Change from baseline to 18 months for eGFRCKD-EPI and mGFRiohexol were taken as secondary endpoints.  
Additional subgroup analysis was performed by the applicant.  
  Results 
Number analysed 
A total number of 68 patients were enrolled into the study and 60 patients were randomised. Out of 
these only 56 amenable patients were analysed as four (4) patients were post-hoc considered as non-
amenable.  
The original data files submitted by the applicant contain evaluable data for 57 patients (53 amenable 
and 4 non-amenable) as three patients did not receive the study drug. Thirty-six (36) patients received 
migalastat and twenty-one (21) received ERT. 
Analyses were performed on the mITT population (34 patients in the migalastat group and 18 patients 
in the ERT group) or Safety Population (36 patients in the migalastat group and 21 patients in the ERT 
group).  
All efficacy analyses were carried out using the mITT Population. The analyses of the primary efficacy 
parameters were also performed on the ITT and PP Populations as supportive analyses. 
No major protocol deviations were made. 
With respect to the HEK analysis this was considered GLP compliant after patients were already 
randomized. Four patients initially randomized to have amenable mutations were considered non-
amenable based on GLP-HEK assay. 
Baseline data 
Some patients had genetic mutations for which the relation with disease activity is disputed (for 
example A143T). 
The submitted individual patient data show that about all data points for eGRF were entered in the CRF 
in the controlled phase. For LVMi up to 22% of the data-points were not entered for a given time point 
in the controlled phase of the study, while for lyso-Gb3 up to 40% of the data-points was missing for a 
given time point in the controlled phase of the study. In the extension phase the percentage of data-
points not entered in the CRF varied from 8% (eGFR) to 52% (lyso-Gb3). 
Demographics were comparable in both treatment groups. Patients in the migalastat group (16 males 
and 20 females) were 50.5 ± 13.76 years and in the ERT group (9 males and 12 females) 46.3 ± 14.9 
years. Five patients were ≥65 years up to 72 years of age (migalastat n=3; ERT n=2). Most patients 
were receiving agalsidase α (37/57) at baseline; 19/57 patients received agalsidase ß. For one 
patient,ERT at baseline was not collected. A total of 27/57 of patients was receiving ACEIs, ARBs, or

RIs. Medical history and prior and concomitant medication were comparable between the groups. In 
this comparative study, about 70% of the patients had multiple organ involvement this suggests a 
reasonable disease burden for most patients. 
Additional post hoc analysis performed by the applicant showed that of the patients included in study 
012, 40 out of 56 patients (70%) had more than 2 organ systems involved prior the start of ERT.

Notes: Percentages are based on the number of patients in the Safety Population. 
The ERT at Baseline was not collected for 1 patient in the migalastat group. 
Baseline for the migalastat group was defined as the last non missing measurement taken prior to the first 
migalastat dose date (including unscheduled assessments). In the case where the last non missing measurement 
and the first dose date coincided, that measurement was considered pre-Baseline. For the ERT group, Baseline was 
defined as the last day prior to or equal to the first dose of ERT, where the first dose was defined as the dose of ERT 
after randomization date (on Visit 3). 
eGFRCKD-EPI is calculated as GFR = 141 x min(Scr/κ, 1)α x max(Scr/κ, 1)-1.209 x 0.993Age x 1.018 [if female] x 
1.159 [if black], where Scr is serum creatinine, κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, α is -0.329 for females and - 
0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/κ or 1, and max indicates the maximum of Scr/κ or 1. 
24-hour urine collection start and stop times were recorded. If collection times were less than or greater than 24 
hours, urine parameters were standardized to a 24-hour collection period. 
Amenable GLA mutations categorized by the GLP HEK assay.

Based on the original data files the total number of patients (amenable as well as non-amenable) available for 
analysis was 56 patients. 
The mean eGFRCKD-EPI at baseline was for migalastat: 89.6 ± 22.2 ml/min/1.73 m2, and 95.8 ± 19.2 
ml/min/1.73 m2 in the ERT group. Mean mGFRiohexol was 82.4 ± 18.1 ml/min/1.73 m2  for migalastat 
and 83.6 ± 23.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 for ERT.  
All patients had proteinuria at baseline based on the urine protein: creatinine ratio (migalastat group 
19.9 ± 21.5 mg/mmol; ERT group 12.8 ± 16.3 mg/mmol). Thus, these patients are considered having 
a near normal kidney function (normal renal function is defined as eGFR about 90 ml/min/1.73 m2) 
with proteinuria (CKD stage 1 or 2).  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy parameters were defined as follows: 
•  Annualized change in mGFRiohexol as assessed by plasma clearance of iohexol from Baseline 
through Month 18. 
•  Annualized change in estimated GFR (eGFR) assessed by the Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation (eGFRCKD-EPI) from Baseline through Month 
18. 
The pre-specified criteria for comparability between migalastat and ERT were:

Mean annualised rate of change in eGFRCKD-EPI was -0.40 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: -2.272, 1.478) in 
the migalstat group compared to -1.03 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI:  -3.636, 1.575) in the ERT group. 
Figure 7 depicts the difference in the mean annualised rate of change between migalastat and ERT 
from baseline to 18 months which was +0.63 for eGFRCKD-EPI and -1.11 for mGFRiohexol, and the overlap 
of the 95% CIs of the changes from baseline was 100%.  
This is within the pre-specified parameters as laid down by the applicant (above). The variance of the 
+0.63 for eGFRCKD-EPI is not known. As per definition the difference should be smaller than 2.2. 
Therefore the 95%CI of the given difference (+0.63) should not include the 2.2. The lower bounds of 
the 90% and 95% confidence intervals were -2.0348 and -2.5662, respectively. The lower bound of 
the 95% CI therefore exceeds the defined 2.2 difference. However this is considered less relevant and 
comparability might be assumed. Change from baseline to 18 months for eGFRCKD-EPI and mGFRiohexol 
were taken as secondary endpoints. For both these endpoints, there seem to be no difference between 
migalastat and ERT. Change from baseline to month 30 showed an annualised rate of -1.718 ± 2.55 
for eGFRCKD-EPI. (95% CI -2.653, -0.782). 
A post hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted to calculate the 90% and 95% confidence intervals of the 
difference in annualized rate of change in eGFRCKD-EPI and mGFRiohexol between migalastat and ERT. 
Based on this analysis, the lower bounds of the difference for mean eGFRCKD-EPI were -2.03 and -2.57, 
respectively. For mGFRiohexol the lower bounds were respectively -5.81 and -6.74, reflecting higher 
variability in determining mGFRiohexol.  
A subgroup analysis, based on eGFRCKD-EPI,  showed that patients with low baseline 24-hour urine 
protein (<100 mg/24 h) compared to patients with high baseline values (≥100 mg/24h) tend to 
benefit slightly more from migalastat treatment compared to ERT. The annualized rate of change <100 
mg/24h was 1.4 ± 5.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 and for ≥100 mg/24h -2.3 ± 2.8 ml/min/1.73 m2. The analysis 
of the results related to the seriousness of the renal insufficiency indicated that the magnitude of the 
effect in not related to the eGFR at baseline.  
Subgroup analysis based on mGFRiohexol only showed that patients with low baseline 24-hour urine 
protein (<100 mg/24 h) slightly benefit from migalastat over ERT.  
However overall, the numbers are too small to draw definite conclusions.  
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary endpoints of importance are urine GL-3, 24-hour urine protein, the composite endpoint 
(based on renal, cardiac, cerebrovascular events and death), LVMi, quality of life (SP-36 
questionnaire), and change in plasma lyso-GL-3 from baseline. 
Urine GL-3 
There was a trend for a greater decrease in urine GL-3 (normalised to creatinine in the same sample) 
from  baseline  to  Month  6  in  the  migalastat  group  (-361±878  ng/mg  creatinine),  compared  with  the 
placebo group (-147±969 ng/mg creatinine) in patients with amenable mutations. 
At  the  end  of  Stage  2,  for  patients  with  amenable  mutations,  after  12  months  of  treatment  with 
migalastat  the  mean  change  for  urine  GL-3  was  -304  ng/mg  creatinine  in  the  migalastat-migalastat 
group  (from  baseline)  and  -469  ng/mg  creatinine  for  the  placebo-migalastat  group  (change  from 
Month 6). 
These  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution,  as  the  significance  of  urinary  GL-3  has  not  been 
established yet. Furthermore, this parameter is not optimal in female patients, as a considerably high 
percentage of female Fabry patients do not have any elevations of urinary GL-3 before treatment.

24-hour urine protein 
At baseline, the mean 24-hour urine protein was 259.6 ± 422.22 mg/day in the migalastat group and 
417.4 ± 735.5 mg/day in the ERT group in the mITT population. The mean change from baseline to 
month 18 was: 49.2 ± 199.5 mg/day for the migalastat group and 194.5 ± 690.8 mg/day for the ERT 
group.  
Baseline 24-hours urine-albumin:creatinine ratio in the migalastat group was 13.55 ± 28.91 mg/mmol 
and in the ERT 21.89 ± 47.08 mg/mmol. Change from baseline to month 18 was for migalastat 5.78 ± 
19.66 mg/mmol and 14.34 ± 40.20 mg/mmol for ERT. As patients (27/57) also received concomitant 
ACEI, ARB or RI medication the results may be cofounded. However data indicate that proteinuria prior 
and after 18 months of treatment did not change in a clinically significant manner.  
LVMi and Other Cardiac Parameters 
Echocardiography (ECHO) was performed to measure parameters including LVMi, LV mass, LV 
fractional shortening, LV ejection fraction, and the systolic and diastolic functional grades. The mean 
baseline LVMi, was 95.3 ± 22.7 g/m2 in the migalastat group and 92.9 ± 25.7 g/m2 in the ERT group 
(mITT). In normal healthy patients of similar age (about 50 years),  the LVMi is 92 to 95 g/m2 (Cain et 
al., 2009) suggesting a near normal LVMi in the study patients. In the overall population, LVMi 
decreased from baseline to month 18 in the migalastat group (mean change, -6.6 ± 12.1 g/m2; 95% 
CI, -11.0, -2.1) and did not notably change from baseline in the ERT group (mean change, -2.0 ± 14.9 
g/m2; 95% CI, -11.0, 7.0). 
 Based on the additional data submitted, it was demonstrated that the effect could be maintained up to 
30 months of migalastat treatment. The change from baseline to 30 months was -3.77 ±13.15 g/m2 
(95% CI -8.873, 1.328) for patients with LVMi at baseline and -9.96 ± 9.33 g/m2 (95% CI -16.630, -
3.288) for patients with LVH at baseline. 
Subgroup analysis shows that LVMi decreased from baseline to month 18 (

g/m2; 18 females, -4.5 ± 11.6 g/m2). In the ERT group LVMi decreased from baseline to month 18 in 
females (n=7) as well (-7.2 ± 9.4 g/m2); in males (n=6) LVMi increased from baseline to month 18 
(4.1 ± 18.5 g/m2).

The baseline value had been modified as the value obtained at the last visit just prior to first dose of study drug. 
However, because the baseline visit could occur over multiple days, the ECHO assessment at Baseline sometimes 
occurred after first dose of study 
Subgroup analysis in 18 patients with abnormal baseline LVMi4 values showed that there was a trend 
for a greater decrease from baseline to month 18 in LVMi in the migalastat group (difference in LS 
means, -10.4 g/m2;

Table 9). This data suggests that migalastat can further normalize LVMi in patients with abnormal LVMi 
values.  
Post hoc analyses showed a similar trend for patients with multi-organ involvement at baseline and 
patients with mutations associated with the classic phenotype (Table 10). Post-hoc analysis further 
shows that the percent decreases from baseline were greatest for patients with baseline LVH (-7.1% 
for migalastat versus +3.2% for ERT-treated patients), and were also greater for patients in the upper 
half of the normal range compared to patients in the lower half of the normal range. However, there is 
a considerable variation due to the limited number of patients included and the missing values and no 
statistical significant difference could be demonstrated. Further, the descriptive statistics suggest a 
more pronounced effect in male patients compared to female, younger patients appear to be showing 
more improvement than elderly patients. Again the variation is large, prohibiting any statistical 
difference to be demonstrated.

Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) 
The mean baseline LVEF, was 64.0 ± 2.9% in the migalastat group and 61.1 ± 4.2% in the ERT group 
(mITT). According to Cain et al., (2009) mean values for LVEF in male is 64-65% and for females 
69%. The mean change from baseline to month 18 was comparable between the migalastat group (-
1.1 ± 3.0 %) and the ERT group (-0.5 ± 4.1%). One patient in each treatment group had an abnormal 
LVEF at baseline. At month 18, all patients had a normal LVEF with the exception of 1 patient in the 
migalastat group (who was also abnormal at baseline), and 3 patients in the ERT group (1 of whom 
was abnormal at baseline).   
Other cardiac parameters 
The left ventricular posterior wall thickness in diastole decreased in the migalastat group from baseline 
to month 18 (mean change, -0.035 cm) but not in the ERT group (mean change, 0.029 cm) in the 
mITT Population. No notable changes from baseline were noted for the migalastat group or the ERT 
group in the mITT population in functional diastolic grade, functional systolic grade, or intraventricular 
septum wall thickness. Most subjects in the mITT population were in the normal range for left 
ventricular fractional shortening, and there was no notable difference between treatment groups in 
mean percentage of left ventricular fractional shortening at any time point. 
Composite Clinical Outcomes 
Based on the number of patients in each treatment group who experienced death or one of the 
following specific renal, cardiac, or cerebrovascular events:  
Galafold 
Assessment report

• Renal events: a decrease in eGFRCKD-EPI ≥15 ml/min/1.73 m2, with the decreased eGFR <90 
ml/min/1.73 m2 relative to baseline; an increase in 24h urine protein ≥33%, with the 
increased protein ≥300 mg relative to baseline. 
• Cardiac events: myocardial infarction, unstable cardiac angina, new symptomatic arrhythmia 
(requiring anti-arrhythmic medication, direct current cardioversion, pacemaker, or defibrillator 
implantation), congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV). 
• Cerebrovascular events: stroke, transient ischemic attack. 
Analysis of the composite clinical outcome endpoint indicated some benefit of migalastat in the most 
important organ systems (kidney, heart, and brain) that contributed to the morbidity and mortality in 
Fabry disease (Table 11).

*Two ERT-experienced patients each had one cardiac and one renal event.  
Renal events included increased proteinuria and decreased GFR (migalastat and ERT treatment groups); cardiac events included 
arrhythmia (migalastat and ERT treatment groups) and cardiac failure (ERT treatment group only); cerebrovascular event was 
transient ischemic attack. 
When looking at a consistent effect on all disease manifestations (defined as beneficial effects on renal 
and cardiac function as well as in the pharmacodynamic (lyso-Gb3)) this can only be assessed in the 
classic male population. After analysis of males with the classical phenotype, it can be concluded that 
only complete data of 7 classic male patients were available (lyso-Gb3 at 6 months, LVMi and GFR at 
24 months) of these 5 (62.5%) showed a beneficial effect on all three parameters. The two remaining 
patients lacked a beneficial response in either lyso-Gb3 or LVMi. Further, one patient showed 
deterioration on all parameters. 
Patient-Reported Outcomes (SF-36v2 and BPI) 
The Short Form Health Survey with 36 questions, version 2 [SF-36 v2] and questions based on the 
Brief Pain Inventory short form, severity component (BPI) were used to collect patient-reported 
outcomes. For the BPI and the SF-36 v2, there were no notable changes from baseline at any time 
point for either the migalastat or the ERT group in study AT1001-012 
Disease Substrates 
Comparison of Migalastat and ERT on Plasma Lyso-Gb3 
Lyso-GB3 is a deacylated form of Gb3 which has been identified as a storage product in Fabry disease 
(Aerst, et al., 2008) and considered a sensitive marker (Rombach et al., 2010; Togawa et al., 2010).

Baseline plasma lyso-Gb3 levels are presented in Table 12. Mean baseline values for migalastat (9.1 ± 
10.8 nmol/l) and ERT (17.6 ± 20.7 nmol/l) suggest that these patients were atypical Fabry patients at 
diagnosis.

The data showed that plasma lyso-Gb3 levels remained low and stable for up to 18 months following 
switch from intravenous ERT to oral migalastat in patients with amenable mutations (Figure 8). ERT 
slightly favouring over migalastat.  
On a patient level, the results could be considered consistent (i.e. patient did not deteriorate). Plasma 
lyso-Gb3 was maintained or decreased in 10/18 patients (61%) on continued ERT and for migalastat 
this was 11/32 patients (34%). When accepting a variation of plasma lyso-Gb3 ≤-1.0 nmol/l5 , 22/32 
(69%) patients remained stable and in the ERT arm 12/18 (67%) patients. 
Of the four patients considered as non-amenable with the updated GLP HEK-assay, two patients (both 
male) showed increased plasma lyso-Gb3 concentrations after switching from ERT to migalastat. The 
two other patients (one male, one female) who remained on ERT had stable low plasma lyso-Gb3 
concentrations. As these patients have a non-amenable mutation, there is no effect to be expected of 
migalastat on lyso-Gb3.  
The observed differences in plasma lyso-Gb3 in patients with amenable versus non-amenable 
mutations further substantiate the accuracy of the GLP HEK assay in categorizing GLA mutations (see  
GLP HEK assay (a.k.a. migalastat amenability assay)

Non-Amenable Mutations (AT1001-012).

Periphenal Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) α-Gal A Activity 
Assessment of WBC α-Gal A activity is less relevant in females because females are mosaic (i.e., 
express both the mutant and wild type α-Gal A). Therefore, only the data on males are considered for 
the assessment. At baseline, the male patients had an α-Gal A activity of 2.9 ± 3.4 nmol/h/mg in the 
migalastat group and in the placebo group the α-Gal A activity was 1.1 ± 2.3 nmol/h/mg.  
The mean increase in PBMC α-Gal A activity from baseline to month 18 was 5.4 ± 4.6 nmol/h/mg in 
the migalastat group (Table 13). Results were consistent with the data from the PD studies. There was 
no change from baseline in the ERT group (mean change, -0.4 ± 1.4 nmol/h/mg). Based on the PD 
data from study AT1001-013, it was observed that α-Gal A activity after infusion with galactosidase-α 
or -ß also increased for a duration of2 hrs after which gradually the α-Gal A activity declined.   
The results demonstrated that the increased α-Gal A activity in the migalastat group is consistent with 
the mechanism of action of migalastat, which binds to and stabilises amenable mutant forms of the 
enzyme, facilitating their proper trafficking to lysosomes.  
5 Given a SD of 4.9 in the ERT treated population after 18 months this deterioration should be considered 
conservative.

months and are included in the SmPC. 
Male patients with classic FD (study 011 only) 
Male patients with the classical presentation were defined having multi-organ system involvement and 
α-Gal A activity <3%. In the medical literature, the classical phenotype has been described to males 
with undetectable to low α-Gal A activity, elevated levels of plasma lyso-Gb3, and early onset of multi- 
organ system involvement (Desnick, Brady et al., 2003; Wilcox, Oliveira et al., 2008; Rombach et al., 
2010). The threshold of <3% was agreed upon.

In study 011, 14 male patients were considered as classical Fabry patients.  
Effects of migalastat on eGFRCKD-EPI, LVMI, and lyso-Gb3 were found in both males with the classical 
presentation and the “other” subgroup consisting of non-classical male patients and female patients 
(Table 16). Due to the limited numbers of patients, no definite conclusions can be drawn. Numerically, 
larger effects in the classical male patients were associated with higher baseline values observed in 
these patients.  
The GFR after 18 or 24 months of treatment in classical male patients showed a decrease of -0.3 
ml/min/1.73 m2/yr (-95%CI 2.8, 2.3). This is in the range of the deterioration of the renal function 
seen in healthy subjects. For the “other” subgroup (study 012), the GFR deterioration was -2.4 ±3.3 
(mean±SD) after 18 months treatment.  
In study 012, the ERT treated patients showed a renal deterioration of -1.5 ± 7.6. After stabilisation 
obtained with ERT in the literature, results are reported to be between -2.2 and -3.0 (no variation of 
these figures could be obtained). In untreated patients, a deterioration between -2.6 and -3.0 is 
reported. The publications of Schwarting (2006) and Branton (2002) were not included because these 
populations included patients with ESRD, thus not considered relevant. Recent literature data suggests 
that in these patients deterioration of renal function is not affected by ERT. 
In the population of classical male patients, the LVMi after 18 or 24 months of treatment showed a 
decrease of -10.4 ± 11.8 g/m2 (mean±SD).  
In study 012, the LVMi decrease was -11.8 ± 12.2 after 18 months treatment.  The ERT treated 
patients showed a deterioration of +4.1±18.5. In the literature for patients with ERT, some 
improvement compared to baseline is reported as between -2.2 ± 8.3 and -3.2 ± 8.2, after about 3 
years of treatment.  Untreated patients showed a deterioration to be between 4.1±1.0 and 8.0 (no 
variation reported). 
Results for the classical male patients treated with migalastat were compared with those from ERT-
treated and untreated patients from Phase 3 studies with agalsidase alfa and beta, as well as with ERT 
registries and other literature for GFR (Table 17) and for LVMi (Table 18).

For study 011, the applicant performed additional analyses in male patients with classical presentation 
to compare GFR, LVMi, and GSRS-D results on placebo with results on migalastat (Table 19). Based on 
the data submitted by the applicant from the available limited number of patients that switched to 
migalastat after the 6 month placebo phase, improvement in mGFR, LVMi and GSRD-D was observed. 
However, no definite conclusion can be drawn due to the limited data.

Analysis of the consistency of effect on all disease manifestations (defined as beneficial effects on renal 
and cardiac function as well as in the pharmacodynamic (lyso-Gb3)) in classical male patients indicate 
that 62.5% showed a beneficial effect on all three parameters. Two patients lacked a beneficial 
response in either lyso-Gb3 or LVMi. andone patient showed deterioration on all parameters. 
Elderly, gender, age 
There were no effects of age, gender, baseline 24-h urine protein, or baseline renal function as 
evaluated by either eGFR or mGFR, on the efficacy of migalastat on renal function. Within the pivotal 
studies only 6 patients up to 72 years were included to date.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
The applicant performed pooled analysis for GFR and LVMi. Additional analyses were submitted from 
the two pivotal studies upon request from CHMP.  
Renal function 
The mean annualised rate of change in eGFRCKD-EPI in patients receiving migalastat was -0.40 (95% ± -
2.272, 1.478) ml/min/1.73 m2 in ERT-experienced patients in AT1001-012 (18 months) and -1.2 ± 14.4 
(ml/min/1.73 m2 in ERT-naïve patients in AT1001-011 after 6 months of placebo treatment, indicating 
stabilisation of renal function in both study populations. Similar results were obtained for mGFRiohexol. 
Additional post hoc analyses of Study AT1001-011 and the open-label extension study AT1001-041 
demonstrated that migalastat stabilised renal function in more severely affected patients (Table 20 and 
Table 21). Results are provided for eGFRCKD-EPI only, as mGFR was not assessed in the open-label 
extension study AT1001-041.

Post-hoc analysis further showed that the decreases from baseline were greater inpatients with 
baseline LVH (-7.1% for migalastat versus +3.2% for ERT-treated patients), and were also greater in 
patients in the upper half of the normal range (i.e. patients with greater but normal LVMi) compared to 
patients in the lower half of the normal range (i.e. patients with smaller but normal LVMi). Further, the 
descriptive statistics suggest a more beneficial effect in male patients compared to female, and

younger patients showed more improvement than elderly patients. However the high variability and 
limited numbers, prohibit any statistical difference to be demonstrated.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has performed two pivotal studies, one randomized, placebo-controlled blinded (AT1001-
011) and one comparative randomized trial (AT1001-012). Scientific Advice was received on the 
methodology of these trials that were in general taken into account by the applicant. 
All patients had a diagnosis of  Fabry Disease in the pivotal studies.  
The GLP-HEK assay is currently the best tool to identify patients with amenable mutations that are 
considered responsive to migalastat therapy. However given the positive predictive value of 95% for 
the HEK test, physicians should be alerted to monitor the clinical response of the patients periodically; 
this is reflected in SmPC section 4.4. 
The applicant presented the GLA mutations for the patients in both pivotal studies. It is however 
known from literature that in Fabry disease that the genotype is not fully expressed leading to variable 
disease expression (phenotype) in patients with the same genotype. For example, the relationship 
between the mutation A143T and the clinical phenotype is currently under discussion.   
Additional ad hoc analyses in Study 011 showed that 14 male patients had a classical phenotype.  
In the placebo-controlled study, either treatment naïve or ERT experienced patients were included. In 
study 012 patients previously treated with intravenous ERT were either switched to oral migalastat 150 
mg QOD or remained on their ERT.  
Demographics between the treatment groups were more or less comparable for baseline disease 
characteristics as for concomitant medication. The Fabry patients in the pivotal studies were about 45-
50 years, had a mean normal LVMi, mild to severe renal impairment (<90 ml/min/1.73 m2), and most 
had some proteinuria (24 hr urine ≥100 mg/24 hrs).  
Differences in age, residual -Gal A activity and plasma lyso-Gb3 values limit the comparability of the 
included patients with the patients treated with  oagalsidase α and agalsidase ß as mentioned in the 
respective EPARs or reported in the literature.  
In the placebo controlled study migalastat dose was either missed or taken more often frequently. This 
was not observed in the ERT comparative study. The applicant provided further clarification considered 
acceptable and sufficiently addressed this issue. Furthermore, in the marketing packaging, a push-out 
has  been  implemented, allowing a better compliance with the intended dosage regimen compared to 
clinical studies The patient will pushes-out the carton every day, including the days where no capsule is 
to be taken (refer to the PI for a mock-up).

Completeness of data 
For study 011, the results are based on a subgroup of patients  defined as amenable patients 
representing 75% of the randomised group of patients. It is assumed that the HEK assay used for the 
determination of amenability will not introduce bias in the results.  
The already limited number of patients available for efficacy analysis further decreases over time with 
94% of the patients being available after 6 months, 88% after one year and 82% after 18 months. 
Due to study design, the results for only 22 patients after 24 months are entered representing 44% of 
the patients.  
Fourteen (14)  male patients from study 011 could be considered as  classical Fabry disease patients. 
Of the 14 male patients, 7 patients had  a complete data set (i.e. all field were complete at 6 and 24 
months).  
In study 012, only 4 patients have been identified as being non-amenable patients; therefore the 
amenable subgroup represents 93% of the randomised group of patients.. In total, 91% of randomised 
amenable patients continued treatment after month 18. Up to month 30 of the study, only migalastat-
migalastat patients were included in the submitted data set and in total only three (3) patients did not 
continue up to month 30. 
Overall, the analysis of the original data files submitted during the assessment and discussed at the OE 
for both pivotal studies showed some minor deviations in patient numbers which were clarified at the 
completion of the assessment.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
GL-3 inclusion in the kidney interstitial capillaries  
The primary endpoint in the placebo controlled study was the IC GL-3 responder analysis (responder 
defined as % of patients with a ≥50% reduction from baseline in the average number of GL-3 
inclusions per kidney interstitial capillaries (IC)). This endpoint was not met in the ITT nor in the mITT. 
A post hoc analysis in the mITT (with only amenable patients ) showed a statistically significant 
reduction from baseline to month 6 in the average number of GL-3 inclusions per IC compared to 
placebo. In addition, the mean change in percentage of kidney IC with zero GL-3 inclusions was in 
favour of migalastat and was statistically significant.  
Plasma lyso-Gb3 
It has been demonstrated that migalastat, overall, reduces plasma lyso-Gb3 in patients with amenable 
mutations. No reduction of plasma lyso-Gb3 was observed in the patients on placebo. 
Due to the fact that Lyso-Gb3 was recognised as an important secondary end point after the start of 
the study in the placebo controlled study (Study 011), only 31 patients out of 51 patients with an 
amenable mutation had available measurements of Lyso-Gb3.  
In study 012, plasma lyso-Gb3 was maintained in 10/18 patients (61%) in the continued ERT group 
and  in 11/32 patients (34%) in the migalastat group. When considering a reduction of plasma lyso-
Gb3 ≤-1.0 nmol/l , being within the margins of the assay method and or biological variation, 22/32 
(69%) patient remained stable in the migalastat group and 12/18 (67%) patients in the ERT arm. The 
results can be considered comparable in both groups. 
Renal function 
After 18/24 months of migalastat treatment patients showed a stable renal function -0.30 ± 0.66 
mL/min/1.73 m2/year which is in line with normal decline in renal function for healthy persons.  
Galafold 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/669526/2015 
Page 80/110 
 
 
 
 
In the ERT comparative study, the applicant demonstrated that migalastat was comparable to ERT in 
maintaining stabilisation of eGFR. The primary endpoint as such was therefore considered achieved.  
An additional post hoc analysis performed in patients with ≥2 organ systems involved and in patients 
associated with the classic Fabry mutation, showed similar results as seen for the whole population.  
Further analysis showed that stabilization of renal function is observed with migalastat amenable 
patients independently of gender, age or seriousness of the renal insufficiency at baseline.  
Cardiac parameters 
In study 011, after 6 months, a comparable effect on LVMi  was observed in both migalastat and  
placebo groups. In study 012, the effect on LVMi after 18 months, was comparable in both migalastat 
and ERT groups. The mean effect on LVMi was maintained in both naïve (study 011) and ERT pre-
treated patients after 24, 30 and 36 months months of treatment. The magnitude of effect is related to 
the baseline LVMi. 
The beneficial effect observed in male patients and in  younger patients was more pronounced than the 
effect  observed in  females and elderly respectively.  
Composite clinical endpoint 
As indicated in the scientific advice by the CHMP (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/288057/2009), the analysis of 
the composite clinical outcome endpoint - indicated comparable effects in kidney and heart between 
migalastat and ERT groups.  
Male patients with classical FD 
Upon request from CHMP, the applicant performed additional analyses in male patients with classical 
Fabry disease.  
In classical male patients, after 24/30 months of treatment , the GFR showed a decrease of -0.3 
ml/min/1.73 m2/yr (95%CI -2.8, 2.3). This decrease is comparable with the  deterioration of the renal 
function as seen in healthy subjects (<-1.0 ml/min/1.73 m2/yr). Results between -2.2 and -3.0 (not 
SD available)  were reported in literature after stabilisation achieved with ERT therapy. In untreated 
fabry  male patients with classical phenotype, a deterioration of the renal function between -2.6 and -
3.0 (no SD available) is reported.  
In classical male patients, after 24/30 months of treatment, the LVMi values showed a decrease of -
10.4 ± 11.8 g/m2 (mean±SD). Literature reports some improvement in LVMi with changes compared 
to baseline observed between -2.2 ± 8.3 g/m2 and -3.2 ± 8.2 g/m2 after about 3 years of ERT therapy. 
In comparison, untreated patients showed a deterioration of LVMi values between +4.1±1.0 g/m2 and 
+8.0 g/m2 (no variation reported). 
With respect to plasma lyso-Gb3 ,a reduction was observed of -36.8 nmol/l (-69.9, -3.7) after 18/24 
months  of migalastat treatment in males with classic FD. This is considered clinically relevant.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Available data allow to conclude that in patients amenable for migalastat a pharmacodynamic and 
clinical effects have been demonstrated. This effect was assessed also in a subgroup of classical male 
Fabry patients with an amenable mutation.  
The diagnosis of FD for all patients in both pivotal studies was based on the physician expertise and 
local clinical guidelines.

Differences in age, residual -Gal A activity and plasma lyso-Gb3 values limit the comparability of the 
included patients with the patients treated with agalsidase α and agalsidase ß as mentioned in the 
respective EPARs or reported in the literature.  
In study 011, the primary endpoint in the ITT (or the mITT population has not been met. In the ERT 
comparative study (study 012), the applicant demonstrated that migalastat was comparable to ERT in 
maintaining stabilisation of eGFR values. Comparable effects were observed on lyso-Gb3 and LVMi 
between ERT and migalastat treated groups. 
Post-hoc analysis showed that  the results observed are independent of age, gender and disease 
burden at baseline, except for LVMi values. For LVMi, the response to migalastat depends on the 
cardiac mass at baseline,  with higher values at baseline resulting in a more pronounced response.  
For study 012, the assay sensitivity is accepted  based on results known from literature data. 
Tennankore et al. (2007) showed that statistical significant worsening occurred in eGFR, 24-hr urine 
protein, Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), and SF-36 nine (9) months after stopping ERT treatment. 
In another publication by Weidemann et al. (2014), after 12 months, statistical significant worsening 
was observed for eGFR, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, MSSI, pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms when 
patients were switch to half the normal dose of ERT treatment.  
Some significant effects on gastrointestinal symptoms, in particular diarrhoea, were observed with 
migalastat but the clinical relevance remains uncertain at present.  
Comparison of the identified classical male FD patients in study 011 with historical ERT data and 
comparison with literature on untreated patients, allows to conclude that in classical male patients the 
response pattern of migalastat on the GFR is comparable with the one observed with ERT therapy and 
is better than placebo. Considering the LVMi results of migalastat treated patients, they indicates the 
same stabilisation as reported for ERT therapy in comparison with  a deterioration of the LVMi reported 
for untreated patients.  
The applicant has clarified  that the data points entered for both pivotal studies was performed 
adequately, though some minor deviations in patient numbers were noticed. These differences 
however do not impact the conclusions  and the results observed in both studies are reliable. The 
clinical data set is considered acceptable for the purpose of assessment of efficacy and safety. The 
efficacy has been demonstrated for patients amenable to migalastat. Migalastat should not be used in 
patients with non amenable mutations. The list of mutations tested as being amenable and non 
amenable is provided in the SmPC. It is advised to monitor the patients to assess renal, cardiac 
functions and biochemical markers  every 6 months. 
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The clinical development program, presented data from 386 patients/healthy volunteers which have 
been exposed to migalastat. Of these, 168 patients with Fabry disease have been treated with 
migalastat in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. One-hundred and nineteen (119) patients have been 
treated for at least 1 year. The longest patient exposure as of 10 October 2014 is 8.8 years, and is 
ongoing. Most patients received the proposed regimen with 150 mg capsule. 
The number of patients exposed to the drug is limited both in time and number of patients. As Fabry is 
an orphan disease this is to be expected and acceptable.

Adverse events 
Phase I studies 
In the healthy volunteers studies, most reported adverse events were headache (N=12, 7.6%), 
dizziness (N=6, 3.8%) and abdominal pain (N=4, 4.3%). No SAEs were reported during any of the 
Phase 1 studies. In healthy volunteers, the reported safety profile was mild. All adverse events 
spontaneously resolved. 
Phase II studies 
In phase II studies, the most reported adverse events were headache (N=7, 20.0%), nausea (N=4, 
11.4%) and abdominal pain (N=4, 11.4%). No SAEs were reported during any of the Phase 2 studies. 
In phase 2 studies, the safety profile in patients was mild with all adverse events spontaneously 
resolvedThe most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10%) in patients treated with migalastat were 
nasopharyngitis, headache, dizziness, influenza, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, upper respiratory 
tract infection, urinary tract infection, and back pain.  
Phase III studies 
Placebo controlled study (AT1001-011) 
The overall frequency of TEAEs was generally similar for migalastat and placebo (31 (91%) in the 
migalastat group and 30 (91%) in the placebo group). The overall percentage of patients who 
experienced TEAEs reported as related to study drug (i.e. definitely, probably, or possibly related) was 
44% in the migalastat group and 27% in the placebo group. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10%) in the migalastat group during Stage 1 were headache, 
nasopharyngitis, nausea, fatigue, pyrexia, and paresthesia (Table 23). The TEAEs with a higher 
frequency (≥ 10% difference) in the migalastat group compared with the placebo group, were 
headache and nasopharyngitis.

Notes: Adverse Events are coded using the MedDRA dictionary (Version 15.0). 
Adverse events presented in this table are any AEs that start after first stage 1 study drug administration (treatment emergent) and before stage 2 first dose date. 
Patients experiencing the same adverse event multiple times are counted only once for the corresponding preferred term. Similarly, patients experiencing multiple adverse events within 
the same system organ class are counted only once for that system organ class. 
Adverse events are sorted alphabetically by system organ class and within each system organ class the preferred term is presented by decreasing order of total frequency. 
Percentages are based on the number of patients in the Safety Population. 
During Stage 2 , a lower percentage of patients reported TEAEs (all patients on migalastat) (79%), 
compared with Stage 1 (placebo-controlled, double-blind phase) (91%). The percentage of patients

who experienced TEAEs that were reported as related to study drug was 27% in the placebo-
migalastat group and 12% in the migalastat-migalastat group. 
Comparison with ERT (AT1001-012) 
Compared to ERT, more AEs were reported for migalastat (14% vs 39%, respectively). SAEs were 
reported more in the ERT arm as compared to the migalastat arm (33% vs 19% respectively). None of 
the patients discontinued due to adverse events.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥10%) in the migalastat group were nasopharyngitis, headache, 
dizziness, influenza, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract 
infection, and back pain. Upper respiratory tract infection and back pain were more reported in the 
migalastat group as compared to the ERT (see Table 24: TEAEs Occurring in ≥ 10% of Patients in 
Either Treatment Group (Safety Population).  
The term procedural pain is known in relation to invasive procedures and especially linked to children. 
The applicant defined the procedural pain as pain in relation to biopsies (kidney and heart).

AE = adverse event; ERT = enzyme replacement therapy; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse 
event. 
Adverse events presented in this table are any AEs that started after first study drug administration (treatment emergent) and before the open-label 
extension period first dose date. 
Patients experiencing the same AE multiple times were counted only once for the corresponding preferred term. Similarly, patients experiencing multiple 
AEs within the same system organ class were counted only once for that system organ class. 
Adverse events are sorted by frequency in the migalastat group. 
Percentages are based on the number of patients in the Safety Population. 
Special populations in the phase III studies. 
The limited information submitted suggests that women experience more AEs compared to men (both 
in frequency as discrete of AE’s).  
Only 3 patients in the migalastat group and 2 patients in the ERT group were older than 65 years of 
age, therefore no analysis for the elderly could be made. 
Although the results do not indicate an increased safety risk for patients with renal impairment, the 
number of patients with renal impairment is too limited to draw definite conclusions .  
No apparent gender or age dependent difference was observed for the percentage of patients 
experiencing AEs, or for the frequency of the various AEs.  
In the placebo controlled study, only one patient was older than 65 years of age, therefore no analysis 
for the elderly could be made. 
The number of patients with renal impairment is too limited to draw conclusions from. The results do 
not indicate an increased safety risk for patients with renal impairment. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
No SAEs were reported during any of the Phase 1 studies.  
In the Phase 2 studies, a total of 31 SAEs were reported (including during screening, on treatment and 
after treatment was discontinued), none of which were considered related to migalastat. These SAEs 
encompassed: TIA (n=3), acroparesthesia, (Fabry acute pain), AV-block (N=2), cardiac perforation 
(due to cardiac biopsy), pericardial haemorrhage (due to cardiac biopsy), arterial injury (due to cardiac 
biopsy), cardiac tamponade (due to cardiac biopsy), musculoskeletal chest pain, atrial fibrillation 
(n=3), Atrial flutter (n=1), Cardiac failure congestive (n=1), Ventricular fibrillation (n=1), 
Hyperthyroidism (n=1), Dyspepsia (n=1), Sensation of foreign body (n=1), Ankle fracture (n=1), Post 
procedural haemorrhage (n=1), Dehydration (n=1), Malnutrition (n=1), CVA (n=1), syncope (n=1), 
epistaxis (n=1), Pneumonia aspiration n=1).

In the Phase 3 studies, a total of 57 SAEs were reported (including during screening, on treatment and 
after treatment was discontinued), 2 of which were deemed related to migalastat. These 2 patients 
experienced fatigue and paraesthesia (one patient), and moderate proteinuria (one patient). 
Two deaths were reported during the clinical program. The events were deemed unrelated to study 
treatment. One patient deceased due to breast cancer after 2 years treatment with migalastat. The 
cause of death for the second patient is unknown. This patient was treated with migalastat for more 
than 2 years and reported various risk factors (transient ischemic attack, obesity, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cardiac stent placement, triple bypass surgery, and cardiac pacemaker 
insertion. The patient also smoked three packs of cigarettes per day for 10 years) that might have 
contributed to the death of the patient. 
Laboratory findings 
In  Phase 2 and 3 studies, no changes or trends of clinical significance were observed for any vital 
signs parameter. Some shifts to abnormal values occurred, but none were considered clinically 
significant. No dose-related trends were observed and there were also no differences between 
migalastat and comparator treatments (placebo or ERT). No trends of clinical significance were 
observed for any physical examination finding.  
In individual Phase 2 and 3 studies, there were no trends of clinical significance for any ECG 
parameter. Some ECG shifts to abnormal values occurred in individual studies, almost all of which were 
assessed as not clinically significant. None of the ECG changes were assessed as treatment-related 
TEAEs. 
Safety in special populations 
QT studiesA QT study was performed.The positive control (moxifloxacin) confirmed this study had 
adequate sensitivity to detect a change on the mean QTc interval of at least 5 msec. The lower bound 
of the 95% one-sided confidence interval of placebo-subtracted difference of QTc after administration 
of moxifloxacin was 9.26 msec at the 2.0 hour time point. 
At therapeutic (150 mg) and supra-therapeutic (1250 mg) doses of migalastat, the cardiodynamic ECG 
analysis showed there was not a statistically significant increase in the placebo-subtracted change in 
QTcI, as defined by the primary analysis measure of an upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence 
interval 10 msec. In addition, corroborative evidence was provided by confirmation of similar findings 
for QTcF, outlier analysis, tabulation of morphology changes, and concentration regression analysis. 
Based on the results of this thorough controlled QT study, migalastat does not cause QT prolongation. 
Age and gender 
No apparent age effect could be observed. However, only  very few patients over the age of 65 were 
included with no patient over the age of 75. Therefore the effect in the elderly population cannot be 
assessed. There are no apparent trends for an effect of gender on the safety of migalastat. 
Renal function 
Analysis suggests that the frequency and severity of TEAEs does not appear related to renal function. 
Race and Ethnicity 
A majority of the subject population in the Phase 3 studies of migalastat were Caucasian. The number 
of  non-Caucasian  subjects  with  Fabry  disease  was  too  small  to  assess  potential  differences  in 
migalastat safety by race/ethnicity.

Body Mass Index 
No data are available that demonstrate the effect of body mass index on the use of migalastat. 
Immunological events 
No immunologic events are reported during the clinical development. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Based upon the available in vitro data, no interactions are expected on CYP and transporters level. 
In vivo, co-administration of migalastat with agalsidase resulted in increased agalsidase activities but 
did not affect agalsidase protein pharmacokinetics; at the 150 mg single dose level an increase in 
agalsidase activity of 2.0 to 4.2-fold is observed. Agalsidase did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
migalastat. This interaction is sufficiently described in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Seven out of 168 patients (4.2%) discontinued due to SAE. The 7 AE encompassed vomiting, 
hypertension, CVA, proteinuria, diarrhoea and vomiting, ALS, lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma. 
Of these 4 were assessed to be treatment related (vomiting, hypertension, proteinuria, vomiting and 
diarrhoea). 
2.5.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical programme for Fabry disease comprised 20 studies in a total of 386 patients/healthy 
volunteers from ten Phase 1, six Phase 2, and four Phase 3 studies. In addition, one physician-initiated 
request program in one patient with Fabry disease and one investigator-initiated trial in one patient 
with Fabry disease have been conducted. Two of the studies are ongoing (AT1001-041, and AT1001-
042). 
In the 20 studies of the migalastat clinical development programme, 371 patients/healthy volunteers 
have been exposed to oral migalastat. Of these, 168 are patients with Fabry disease. One-hundred and 
nineteen (119) patients have been treated for at least 1 year. The longest patient exposure to date is 
8.8 years as of 10 October 2014. Due to the limited number of patients treated for about 18 month, 
only limited conclusions on the short term safety can be drawn. Safety information on chronic use over 
2 years is not submitted. The limited number of patient and the short term exposure are adequate  for 
registration due to the rarity of the disease but do not allow complete identification of the safety 
profile. Further safety characterisation is deemed necessary in the post registration phase and will be 
done through the registry as detailed in the RMP.  
The migalastat clinical development program included male and females patients, healthy volunteers, 
volunteers with renal impairment, patients with Fabry disease, and elderly patients (>65 years of age, 
n=6, and a range of doses and regimens (50 mg – 2000 mg). During the clinical trials exposure of 
three pregnant women has been noted. Appropriate wording is added in the SmPC.  
Phase 1 and 2 studies demonstrated that treatment with migalastat up to 2000 mg was found to be 
generally safe and well tolerated. 
In the phase 3 studies, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10%) in the migalastat group were 
headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, fatigue, pyrexia, and paresthesia. Compared to ERT, more 
patients on migalastat reported headache, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection. 
Patients switched on ERT reported more influenza, cough and sinusitis. TEAEs reported with the use of 
migalastat were mostly mild or moderate in nature, and required no intervention or were readily 
managed in standard clinical practice.  
Galafold 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/669526/2015 
Page 89/110 
 
 
 
 
Due to the limited number of patients, the safety profile need to be further characterised. However, no 
safety issue were identified from the safety database.  
In both phase 3 studies, the overall frequency of treatment related AEs decreased from 44% in the 
initial period to 21% in the open-label extension.  
In the Phase 3 studies, a total of 57 SAEs were reported, 2 of which were deemed related to 
migalastat. These 2 patients experienced fatigue and paraesthesia in one patient, and moderate 
proteinuria in the other patient. The frequency of SAE increased from 6% in the initial stage to 19% in 
the open label extension phase. Post hoc analysis showed that overall, the adverse events frequency is 
not increased over time. The observation seen after 18 months is probably linked to the study design 
in particular the change to an open uncontrolled design. 
There were no deaths related to migalastat. There were 2 deaths unrelated to migalastat (one from 
breast cancer, one from unknown cause). 
There were few discontinuations due to TEAEs, and most were related to underlying Fabry disease co-
morbidities. 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory values, physical examinations, vital signs, or 
ECGs. 
A four-arm, single dose, placebo-controlled thorough QT study (AT1001-010) including 52 healthy 
patients  demonstrated that migalastat at a therapeutic dose (150 mg) or supra-therapeutic dose 
(1250 mg) has no effect on QTc interval.  
In summary, the adverse events profile appears to be mild with mild or moderate adverse events 
which resolve spontaneously. The most reported adverse events were headache, proteinuria, 
bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, nausea, fatigue, pyrexia, and paresthesia.  The most common adverse 
reaction was headache, which was experienced by approximately 10% of patients who received 
Galafold.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.5.6.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data provided in the application asbased on the adverse event profile, laboratory 
evaluations, physical examinations, vital signs, and ECGs, demonstrate that migalastat 150 mg QOD is 
generally safe and well-tolerated in the treatment for patients with Fabry disease. 
The safety profile has been characterised in a limited number of patients in short term exposure. 
Although this considered adequate for registration, the safety profile of migalastat need to be further 
characterised overlong term. This will be done in a Post Authorisation Safety Study ( registry) as 
defined in the RMP.

An abstract protocol for the Prospective, Multi-Center, Multinational, Observational Disease Registry in 
Fabry Disease Patients Treated with Migalastat and Untreated Patients has been provided. The 
objectives of this study are to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of migalastat in Fabry 
disease patients in real-world setting. 
The study as planned is not built on the existing Fabry registry as requested but on a new parallel 
register. This raises several questions on the selection mechanism for recruitment of patients and a 
risk for substantial loss to follow-up. In addition there are uncertainties with regard to the choice of 
control group and with study dimension. The applicant should continue their efforts to get access to 
the existing register and should submit a full study protocol, as a Post-Authorisation Measure (PAM), 
for review by PRAC, within 6 months following CHMP positive opinion.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  Inclusion of a link to a website in the SmPC 
The applicant proposed to include a reference to a website in the SmPC which would provide a user-
friendly search function for amenable and non-amenable mutations already tested. From a clinical 
perspective and considering the high number of mutations tested at present (more than 800), such 
reference in the SmPC to a website including a search tool for amenable and non-amenable mutations 
is considered very helpful. This link will allow healthcare professionals to search for the patient’s 
mutation and find out whether a specific GLA mutation has been classified as amenable to treatment 
with migalastat or non amenable. The list of amenable and non amenable mutations currently tested is 
provided in the SmPC in section 5.1. Currently, the amenable mutations represent 269 mutations and 
the non amenable mutations represent 581 mutations out of the 850 mutations tested with the HEK 
GLP assay.  
It is estimated that about 30-40 new mutations per year will be discovered in the next years.  
The content of the above mentioned website must, however, comply at any time with the following 
conditions:  
2) The scientific content of the website, and in particular, the list of amenable and non-amenable 
mutations, can only duplicate information already present in the latest approved SmPC for the 
medicinal product.  
2) The website must not contain any information that is not compatible with the approved SmPC. 
3) No promotional content should be provided in the website.  
3) The CHMP review is limited to the scientific content of the website. The CHMP does not assess the 
compliance of the website with EU Member States’ national laws governing the advertising and 
promotion of medicinal product. 
Update of the website after initial approval  
As new mutations are tested, information concerning such new mutations may not be included in the 
website before this information is incorporated in the latest approved SmPC for the medicinal product 
through the appropriate variation procedure.   
In conclusion, the inclusion of a link to a website in the SmPC is exceptional but considered acceptable 
in this particular case provided that all of the above conditions are met. The applicant has signed a 
declaration to commit that the website content will reflect the latest approved SmPC for the medicinal 
product and will not contain information incompatible with this SmPC. The applicant also undertakes to 
ensure that the website will not contain promotional materials. 
2.8.2.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
Galafold 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/669526/2015 
Page 93/110 
 
 
 
 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.3.  Additional monitoring 
  Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Galafold (migalastat) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, 
was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Fabry disease is a rare, progressive X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, affecting both males and 
females.  The reduction in α-Gal A activity results in an accumulation of glycosphingolipids, including 
globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) and leads to the 
symptoms of Fabry disease. Fabry disease encompasses a spectrum of disease severity and age at 
onset, and can be divided into two main phenotypes, “classic” and “late-onset”. Classical Fabry disease 
can affect all 3 major organs (heart, kidney, central nervous system) and in end-stage disease trigger 
life-threatening events. In contrast, variant α-Gal A mutations may result in less aggressive clinical 
phenotypes, which are, leading to single organ involvement and late onset disease (Niemann et al., 
2014) or so called “atypical” Fabry patients. 
Migalastat HCl (migalastat) is an analogue of the terminal galactose of GL-3, the natural substrate of 
α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). Migalastat binds to the active site of GL-3 and physically stabilizes 
defective α-Gal A enzymes. This enables the enzyme to pass into the lysosome where migalastat is 
released and activated α-Gal A reduces the substrate levels involved in Fabry disease.  
Five pharmacodynamic studies in patients with Fabry disease were performed. Patients were selected 
for mutations based on a HEK-assay that were responsive to migalastat, thus defined as amenable 
mutations. The positive predictive value of the GLP HEK assay on a patient level is 95%. Further, given 
a specificity of 88%, about 12% of the patients will be wrongly identified. The HEK GLP assay despite 
its limitations in the identification of amenable and non-amenable patients is considered acceptable for 
the definition of amenability to migalastat therapy.  
The diagnosis of FD for all patients in both pivotal studies was based on the physician expertise and 
local clinical guidelines.  
The phase III program consisted of two pivotal studies. One open label active controlled study (012) 
compared oral migalastat versus intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). ERT experienced 
patients with an amenable mutation were either switched to oral migalastat 150 mg QOD or 
maintained their ERT for 18 months. The patients could participate in a 12-month open label 
extension. At the end of the study, the patients could participate in a long-term follow-up study 
currently ongoing (042).

Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/669526/2015 
Page 94/110 
 
 
 
 
 
The second pivotal study was a double blind, randomized placebo controlled study (study 011) in ERT 
naïve patients or in patients in whom ERT had been discontinued for at least 6 months. All patients 
received oral migalastat 150 mg QOD or matching placebo for 6 months. Thereafter, patients on 
placebo were switched to migalastat 150 mg QOD for 6 months, and patients already on migalastat 
continued for another 6 months. After the 12 months of the main study each patient could be enrolled 
in 12-months open label extension study. At the end of the study patients could participate in a long-
term follow-up study (041) currently ongoing. 
Increases in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) α-Gal A activity and decreases in GL-3 observed 
with migalastat 150 mg QOD were not further enhanced when patients switched to higher, less 
frequent doses (250 and 500 mg, 3 days on/4 days off), supporting the selection of the 150 mg QOD 
regimen for study in Phase III trials. 
In the pivotal placebo controlled study (011), patients with >50% reduction of GL-3 inclusion bodies in 
the interstitial capillaries of the kidney were considered responders as defined in the protocol. This 
responder analysis (primary endpoint) did not reach statistical significant effect neither in the ITT nor 
in the mITT-population. However, when excluding patients who are non-responsive to migalastat (non 
amenable patients), a post hoc analysis showed a statistical significant difference in the decrease of 
the percentage of GL-3 inclusions in patients with amenable mutations (mITT-population) compared to 
placebo. In addition, the mean change in percentage of kidney IC with zero GL-3 inclusions was in 
favour of migalastat and was statistically significant.  
It has been demonstrated that migalastat, overall, reduces plasma lyso-Gb3 in patients with amenable 
mutations. No reduction of plasma lyso-Gb3 was observed in the patients on placebo. Indeed, after 6 
months of treatment in the placebo study, lyso-Gb3 concentrations in the migalastat group decreased 
statistically significantly compared to placebo. Also in study 012, when considering a reduction of 
plasma lyso-Gb3 ≤-1.0 nmol/l , plasma lyso-Gb3 was maintained in 12/18 patients (61%) in the  ERT 
group as compared to 22/32 patients (69%) in the migalastat group . It was also demonstrated that  
in the patients included with a mutation subsequently qualified as non-amenable, and were switched 
from ERT to migalastat an increase in lyso-Gb3 was observed. 
eGFR was the primary endpoint in the ERT-comparative study and a secondary endpoint in the placebo 
controlled study. In the ERT comparative study, migalastat was comparable to ERT in maintaining 
stabilisation of eGFR. The mean annualised rate of change in eGFRCKD-EPI was -0.40 mL/min/1.73 m2 
(95% CI: -2.272, 1.478) in the Galafold group compared to -1.03 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: -3.636, 
1.575) in the ERT group. At 6 months, in the placebo-controlled study, changes in GFR were 
comparable in the placebo and migalastat treated groups. After an average of 36 months of treatment 
in the ERT naïve study, the mean annualised rate of change in eGFRCKD-EPI was -0.81 mL/min/1.73 m2 
(95% CI: -2.00, 0.37) for migalastat. When combining data from both pivotal studies, it was shown 
that GFR stabilised after 24 to 36 months of treatment with less variability. Additionally, post-hoc 
analysis indicated that GFR stabilisation is independent of age, gender or renal impairment at baseline. 
In the placebo study no clinical significant difference in LVMi values was observed after 6 months of 
treatment with migalastat compared to placebo. Long term efficacy data (24/30 months) from the 
extension study with migalastat showed a marginal decrease of the LVMi values in the migalastat 
group. In the ERT-comparative study, no statistical significant difference in reduction of LVMi was 
demonstrated. Notably, the mean baseline LVMi values in both pivotal studies were considered to be in 
the normal range for age and gender. Post hoc analyses showed that patients with ≥2 organ systems 
involved and patients with a classic Fabry associated mutation showed similar trends. In patients with 
LVH at baseline, a more pronounced effect was observed in favour of migalastat in individual cases, 
but variability in the response was noticed. The percent decreases from baseline were greater for 
patients in the upper half of the normal range (i.e. patients with greater but normal LVMi) compared to 
Galafold

patients in the lower half of the normal range (i.e. patients with smaller but normal LVMi). This also 
applied to male patients and younger patients. 
24 Hour urine protein was a secondary endpoint in both the comparative and placebo-controlled study. 
No significant differences with migalastat were observed in both studies with an increase in 24 hr urine 
protein observed in both the ERT and placebo groups.  
Some positive effects on the gastro-intestinal symptoms of the disease were observed in the placebo 
controlled study after 6 months, which were maintained up to 24 months in the follow-up studies. QoL 
questionnaire showed numerical improvements in the general health domain score. 
In the placebo controlled study, PBMC α-Gal A activity was measured in males only. There was no 
significant difference for the change from baseline to 6 months of treatment in both study arms. 
However, post hoc analysis in male patients showed that the increase in PBMC α-Gal A activity is more 
pronounced in patients with higher levels of α-Gal A activity at baseline. The clinical relevance of this 
observation needs however to be established. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
For all included patients in the pivotal studies, the diagnosis of FD was confirmed (study 011) or was 
made plausible based on the disease symptoms prior ERT treatment (study 012). However in the latter 
study, this could not be entirely confimed for all patients. 
The in vitro HEK assay was used to identify those patients with a genetic mutation that shows a 
relevant increased a-gal A activity in the presence of migalastat. Despite this increase of a-gal A 
activity in vitro, some mutations seem not to show an improvement in biochemical markers (i.e. lyso-
Gb3). This justifies the need to periodically monitor the patients and to reconsider the treatment in 
case of insufficient response after 6 months of treatment as mentioned in the SmPC section 4.4. 
During the assessment, an important proportion of data points was missing and questions were raised 
regarding the reliability of the data. Therefore, the original data files and CFRs were requested from 
the MAH and analysed. It was shown that the majority “non-assessable” data points were due to 
patients having discontinued the study and thus having no data available after that time. The 
remaining non-assessable data points were due to the fact that plasma lyso-Gb3 was added mid-study 
by protocol amendment where the additional consent or retained plasma samples where not available 
in all patients. Some slight inconsistencies were observed, however these are not considered to have 
impacted the overall results and conclusions. 
The patients included in the pivotal studies showed large heterogeneity in genotype, phenotype and 
clinical presentation. Sometimes patients have been included with a phenotype (A143T) that is not 
associated with disease activity, for example. It is still currently under debate in the scientific 
community on when to treat non-classical FD patients. Given their heterogeneity, the comparability of 
the migalastat data with the pivotal registration trials from agalsidase α or agalsidase ß or with the 
data described in the literature remains limited and thus caution should be considered. The post-hoc 
analysis performed in 14 male patients with classical Fabry disease showed , pharmacodynamic and 
clinical beneficial effects. These results are considered clinically relevant and are more or less 
comparable with the results reported in literature for ERT. Additionally, they compared favourably in 
the treated migalastat arm with the results obtained in untreated patients  (study 011).  
Although in study 012 response in treatment with migalastat was comparable to ERT, the study had its 
limitations because of the absence of a placebo group and the fact that no information of the course of 
the disease before inclusion is available.

In total 6 patients aged ≥ 65 to 72 years and one patient aged 16 years were treated to date, 
therefore, there is only limited experience in these populations. This is addressed in the RMP. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
In the 20 studies of the migalastat clinical development programme, 371 patients/healthy volunteers 
have been exposed to oral migalastat. Of these, 168 were patients with Fabry disease. One-hundred 
and nineteen (119) patients have been treated for at least 1 year.  
Phase 1 and 2 studies demonstrated that treatment with migalastat up to a 2000 mg single dose was 
found to be generally safe and well tolerated. 
Most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10%) in the phase 3 studies in the migalastat group were 
headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, fatigue, pyrexia, and paresthesia. Compared to ERT, more 
patients on migalastat reported headache, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection. 
Patients on ERT reported more influenza, cough and sinusitis. TEAEs reported with the use of 
migalastat were mostly mild or moderate in nature, and required no intervention or were readily 
managed in standard clinical practice. 
In the placebo controlled study, the overall frequency of treatment related AE decreased from 44% in 
the initial period to 21% in the open-label extension.  
In the Phase 3 studies, a total of 57 SAEs were reported, 2 of which were deemed related to 
migalastat. These 2 patients experienced fatigue and paraesthesia in one patient, and moderate 
proteinuria in the other patient.  
There were no deaths related to migalastat. There were 2 deaths unrelated to migalastat (one from 
breast cancer, one from unknown cause). 
There were few discontinuations due to TEAEs (n=7), and most were related to underlying Fabry 
disease co-morbidities. 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory values, physical examinations, vital signs, or 
ECGs. 
A thorough QT study demonstrated that migalastat at a therapeutic dose (150 mg) or supra-
therapeutic dose (1250 mg) has no effect on QTc interval.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Long term safety cannot be assessed as information on chronic use over 2 years is not submitted. The 
limited number of patients and the relatively short term exposure with migalastat do not allow 
complete identification of the safety profile. Further characterisation of the safety profile is deemed 
necessary in the post registration phase and will be done through the registry as detailed in the RMP. 
The frequency of SAE increases from 6% in the initial stage to 19% in the open label extension phase. 
Post hoc analysis and additional safety data showed that the adverse events frequency is not increased 
over time.  
The increase in SAEs observed after 18 months is probably linked to the study design in particular the 
change to an open uncontrolled design in the extension study. 
The  observed  male  infertility  in  the  preclinical  studies  was  not  studied  in  humans.  No  infertility  was 
reported  in  clinical  studies.  The  observation  that  one  of  the  partners  of  a  male  patient  became

pregnant is considered reassuring and during the clinical trials, exposure of three pregnant women has 
been noted. 
Overall,  there  has  been  no  apparent  effect  of  gender  and  age  on  the  safety  profile  of  migalastat. 
However, no analyses across studies were performed.

Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The current treatment in Fabry disease consists of ERT and is restricted to eligible patients only 
(Biegstraaten et al., 2015). ERT is hampered by its parenteral use, antibody formation and local side 
effects. Therefore, in Fabry disease, there remains an unmet medical need for additional therapies and 
the oral mode of administration of migalastat could be an advantage, at least for those patients 
defined with an amenable mutation.  
Pharmacological activity was demonstrated in particular in the placebo-controlled study in male 
patients with classic Fabry phenotype with a statistical significant reduction of lyso-Gb3 and statistical 
significant reduction in the average GL-3 inclusion bodies in the interstitial capillaries of the kidney. 
The clinical relevance of these pharmacodynamic effects in the currently claimed population was 
discussed, because the primary endpoint of responder analysis (patients with >50% reduction of GL-3 
inclusion bodies) did not reach a statistical significant effect in the overall study population (study 
011). Treatment naive patients showed stabilisation with respect to renal and cardiac function, in the 
first 6 months of the 011 study (blinded part). However no differences could be demonstrated 
compared to placebo. Improvements in GI symptoms did occur, but their clinical relevance remains 
difficult to interpret due to the limited number. 
The reason why the primary endpoint was not met can explained by the fact that a HEK assay has 
been GLP validated after enrolment of the study and some subjects where subsequently identified as 
non amenable patients. This has been  demonstrated by a post hoc analysis in amenable patients. This 
post hoc analysis showed a statistical significant difference with placebo in the decrease of % GL-3 
inclusions. Additionally, further analysis of the eGFR and LVMi in the classical male patients phenotype 
during open follow-up period indicated that 1) the stabilisation achieved with migalastat is in line with 
ERT treatment (based on historical comparison with agalsidase α and agalsidase β data) and 2) the 
results observed with migalastat are better than the results observed in untreated patients. The results 
observed in the male patients with classical phenotype are clinically relevant.  
These results are further supported by the data from the ERT comparative study, where changes in the 
primary endpoint of eGFR after 18 months of migalastat treatment were considered comparable with 
ERT. Beneficial effects on LVMI were also observed.  Of note, this study was hampered by some 
limitations as follows: The number of patients tested was small and the data >18 months are 
uncontrolled with no placebo arm and absence of information on the course of the disease before 
inclusion (assay sensitivity). However, the available literature data in non-classical FD patients indicate 
that when ERT treatment is stopped or when half the normal dose of ERT is administered, the 
deterioration of FD symptoms may occur already after 9 months, suggesting that in some patients 
treated with migalastat a true clinical effect can be concluded, considering the duration of the trial.  
Post-hoc analysis showed that the results observed are independent of age, gender and disease burden 
at baseline, except for LVMi values. For LVMi values, the response to migalastat depends on the 
cardiac mass at baseline (higher values at baseline will result in a more pronounced response). 
In both studies, the variability in the response was high, but data, although limited, seem to indicate 
that this variability would diminish over time after 24/30 months of treatment. Long term data (up to 
38 months) from the placebo study indicated that stabilisation of eGFR and/or a reduction of cardiac 
mass was achieved in some patients treated with migalastat. 
Nevertheless, the physician should closely monitor the patients on migalastat, and  re-evaluate the 
therapy after 6 months or stop migalastat treatment as necessary. This is addressed in the SmPC.

In the ERT-controlled study, all patients were diagnosed with Fabry disease by their treating physicians 
and in accordance with local treatment guidelines. Patients included in the pivotal studies were not 
always comparable with the patients mentioned in literature who are generally considered classical 
Fabry patients. The discussion when to treat non-classical FD patients pharmacologically is still ongoing 
and under debate, compared to classical Fabry patients. Therefore the decision to treat non clinical 
Fabry patients should be ultimately left to the treating physician and no further restrictions in the 
indication is necessary apart from the amenability of the patient mutation.  
The available adverse event profile, laboratory evaluations, physical examinations, vital signs and 
ECGs, demonstrated that migalastat 150 mg QOD is a generally safe and well-tolerated treatment for 
Fabry disease.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The diagnosis of FD for all patients in both pivotal studies was based on the physician expertise and 
local clinical guidelines.  
The available data showed that in patients amenable for migalastat, pharmacodynamic and clinical 
effects have been demonstrated.  
This clinical effect was assessed also in a subgroup of classical male Fabry patients with an amenable 
mutation.Comparison of the identified classical male FD patients in study 011 with historical ERT data 
and comparison with literature on untreated patients, allows to conclude that, in classical male 
patients,  the response pattern of migalastat on the GFR is comparable with the one observed with  
Enzyme replacement therapy and is better than placebo.  
The LVMi results of migalastat treated patients  indicate the same  favourable stabilisation as reported 
for ERT therapy compared to  a deterioration in untreated patients.  
Differences in age, residual -Gal A activity and plasma lyso-Gb3 values limit the comparability of the 
included patients with the patients treated with agalsidase α and agalsidase ß as mentioned in the 
respective EPARs or reported in the literature.  
Migalastat 150 mg QOD has a generally safe and well-tolerated safety profile, athough patient 
exposure remains limited. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The applicant has clarified  that the data points entered for both pivotal studies was performed 
adequately, though some minor deviations in patient numbers were noticed. These differences 
however do not impact the conclusions and the results observed in both studies are considered 
reliable. The clinical data set is considered acceptable for assessment of efficacy and safety. 
Uncertainties remain due to trial design, limited number of patients tested, variability in response and 
lack of long-term clinical data, but the level of evidence is considered sufficient and acceptable for such 
a rare disease. 
The efficacy has been demonstrated for patients amenable to migalastat based on the 
pharmacodynamic and clinical effects observed. Migalastat should not be used in patients with non 
amenable mutations. The list of mutations tested as being amenable and non amenable is provided in 
the SmPC.  
The oral administration could be an advantage in patients with Fabry disease compared to ERT. 
Treatment decisions will need to be made on an individual patient basis and adequate monitoring is 
necessary. It is advised to monitor the patients to assess renal, cardiac functions and biochemical 
markers every 6 months.

An acceptable safety profile has been demonstrated, it remains however limited over time based on 
the current data.  Further safety data will be provided after marketing authorisation to further 
characterise the safety profile of migalastat over long term in the clinical setting. 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The CHMP consider the overall B/R of migalastat to be positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Galafold for long-term treatment of adults and adolescents aged 16 
years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency) and who 
have an amenable mutation is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing 
authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for capecitabine, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
During this PSUR period, 4 fatal cases of drug-drug interaction between brivudine and capecitabine were 
reported. To further minimise the risk of this potentially fatal interaction, a warning regarding this 
interaction should be added to section 4.4 of the SmPC and the existing contra-indication and drug-drug 
interaction information should be amended in sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC. Furthermore, the 
information in the product information should focus on brivudine and any reference concerning the non EU 
authorised sorivudine should be deleted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for capecitabine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing capecitabine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

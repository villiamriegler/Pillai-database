Introduction 
Enbrel is indicated for: 
Enbrel can be used alone or in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of active rheumatoid 
arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate 
(unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. 
Enbrel is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults 
not previously treated with methotrexate. 
In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Enbrel used alone or in combination with methotrexate has been 
shown to slow the progression of disease-associated structural damage as measured by X-ray. 
Treatment of active polyarticular-course juvenile chronic arthritis in children aged 4 to 17 years who 
have had an inadequate response to, or who have  proved intolerant of,  methotrexate. Enbrel has not 
been studied in children aged less than 4 years. 
Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-
modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. 
Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to 
conventional therapy. 
Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a 
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including cyclosporine, methotrexate or 
PUVA. 
Enbrel  treatment  should  be  initiated  and  supervised  by  specialist  physicians  experienced  in  the 
diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or psoriasis. 
In adults the posology for Enbrel is:  
Rheumatoid arthritis 
25 mg Enbrel administered twice weekly is the recommended dose, alternatively, 50 mg administered 
once weekly  (as two 25  mg injections  given  at approximately the same time)  has  been  shown  to be 
safe and effective. 
Psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis 
25  mg  Enbrel  administered  twice  weekly  is  the  recommended  dose.    Doses  other  than  25  mg 
administered twice weekly have not been studied. 
Plaque psoriasis 
The  recommended dose  of Enbrel is 25  mg  administered twice  weekly.  Alternatively, 50 mg  given 
twice  weekly  may  be  used  for  up  to  12  weeks  followed,  if  necessary,  by  a  dose  of  25  mg  twice 
weekly.    Treatment  with  Enbrel  should  continue  until  remission  is  achieved,  for  up  to  24  weeks.  
Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. 
If re-treatment with Enbrel is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be followed.  
The dose should be 25 mg twice weekly.

In  children  and  adolescents  (≥  4  to  ≤ 18 years)  with  juvenile  chronic  arthritis,  the  posology  is  
0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose) given twice weekly as a subcutaneous injection with 
an interval of 3 – 4 days between doses.  
The  prevalence  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  is  approximately  0.5  –  1  %  of  the  population.  Overall  the 
disease is three times more common in women than in men.  The peak age of onset is between ages  
45 and 60. Diagnosis is based on a set of criteria, including signs of symmetrical joint inflammation, 
radiological  signs  of  joint  destruction  and  increased  levels  of  rheumatoid  factors.    Juvenile  chronic 
arthritis  (also  known  as  juvenile  rheumatoid  arthritis)  is  the  most  common  rheumatic  condition  in 
children, with an estimated prevalence of 1 per 1000.  
Enbrel is a recombinant human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75Fc fusion protein.  Tumor necrosis 
factor  (TNF)  is  a  dominant  cytokine  in  the  inflammatory  process  of  rheumatoid  arthritis:  TNF  has 
been  shown  to  be  present  in  the  synovial  fluid  and  tissue  of  inflamed  joints  of  rheumatoid  arthritis, 
and, both by itself and by stimulating the production of interleukin-1, to stimulate cartilage and bone 
to produce proteases which contribute to cell destruction.  TNF may therefore be an appropriate target 
for therapeutic intervention.  Enbrel is a competitive inhibitor of TNF that binds to and renders TNF 
biologically inactive by preventing the binding of TNF to its cellular receptors.  
Psoriasis  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  disorder  of  the  skin  characterised  by  increased  epidermal 
proliferation. Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis and its course may have 
flare-ups and remission. First line therapies are topical (i.e. emollients, tar, dithranol, steroids) and the 
second  line  treatments  include  phototherapy,  systemic  methotrexate,  cyclosporin  and  retinoids.  
The levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in serum and in psoriatic lesions are increased compared 
with  levels  in  uninvolved  skin  in  patients  and  in  normal  individuals.  TNF  levels  decrease  after 
effective  psoriasis  therapy,  correlating  with  clinical  improvement.  It  has  been  suggested  that 
interfering with the  pro-inflammatory effects of TNF may reduce the inflammation seen in  psoriatic 
lesions.

Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition 
The  finished  product  is  a  lyophilised  cake  containing  etanercept  (25  mg),  mannitol,  sucrose  and 
trometamol. No preservatives are added.   
The primary container/closer system consists of a 4 ml type I (Ph. Eur.) glass vial sealed with a butyl 
rubber lyophilisation stopper, aluminium seal and a flip-off plastic cap. 
The lyophilised cake is to be dissolved in 1.0 ml of water for injections.  The solvent, if provided, is 
supplied in pre-filled syringes containing 1 mL of water for injections.  The syringe is either a type I 
(Ph. Eur.) glass barrel with rubber stopper and a fixed stainless steel needle or a type I (Ph. Eur.) glass 
barrel with rubber stopper and Luer-Lok connector, a vial adapter for reconstitution and one stainless 
steel needle.  
During the development of the product, the level of excipients was selected to provide stability during 
lyophilisation, satisfactory appearance, shelf life and suitable osmolality of the reconstituted solution.  
Active substance 
Enbrel  is  a  novel  rDNA  product  containing  the  cloned  fusion  protein,  etanercept,  consisting  of  the 
extracellular ligand-binding portion of human tumor necrosis factor receptor (p75) linked to an analog 
human Fc portion of human IgG1.  The Fc component contains the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions, but 
not the CH1 region of IgG1.  Etanercept (TNFR:Fc) is synthesized by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) 
cells as  a dimeric, secreted,  soluble protein. Dimerisation of the Fc region via two disulphide bonds 
occurs post-translation. Etanercept contains 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of 
150  kDa.  The  active  substance  is  manufactured  at  Boehringer  Ingelheim  Pharma,  Germany,  or  at 
Amgen  Rhode Island, USA.

Gene construct and cell banks 
The  cDNA  for  the  p75  TNF  receptor  was  cloned  from  a  human  fibroblast  cell  line.  Human  IgG1 
cDNA  was  cloned  by  PCR  amplification  using  a  published  nucleotide  sequence.  Details  of  the 
preparation, storage and distribution of the master cell bank (MCB) have been provided. Description 
of preparation, storage and current distribution of the working cell bank (WCB) is also summarised. 
End  of  production  (EOP)  cells  have  been  prepared  from  the  WCB.  The  sterility,  freedom  from 
mycoplasma  and  viral  safety  of  the  MCB,  WCB  and  EOP  have  been  demonstrated.  The  genetic 
stability of the MCB, WCB and EOP has been established.  
Cell Culture 
Etanercept is produced by cell culture.  Assurance is given that raw materials from animal origin, used 
during the cell culture process, do not present a risk of BSE/TSE. In-process testing during cell culture 
includes tests for microbial growth, microscopic contamination, endotoxin, cell density, viability, pH, 
osmolality,  CO2,  glucose,  lactate  and  etanercept  production.  In-process  specifications  have  defined 
acceptance criteria.  
Purification 
The  downstream  processing  of  the  active  substance  is  a  sequence  of  validated  chromatographic  and 
ultrafiltration steps and viral filtration.  In-process controls and specifications are adequate to control 
the quality and consistency of production.  Maximum lifetimes for the columns and the ultrafiltration/ 
diafiltration systems have been set.  
Characterisation 
The  active  substance  has  been  characterised  using  a  combination  of  traditional  and  state  of  the  art 
physicochemical techniques.  
The  active  substance  is  adequately  controlled  by  a  combination  of  physico-chemical,  biological  and 
immunological  methods.    All  analytical  procedures  have  been  validated.  Batch  analysis  data 
demonstrate a consistent production of the active substance.  
Other ingredients 
All excipients and immediate packaging materials meet the requirements of the Ph. Eur. 
Product development and finished product 
Enbrel  is  manufactured  by  Boehringer  Ingelheim  Pharma  Germany,  and  Dutch  State  Mines,  USA.  
Assembly,  packaging,  labelling  and  final  release  will  be  done  by Wyeth  Laboratories  UK  or  Wyeth 
Medica,  Ireland.    The  manufacturing  processes  have  been  validated.  The  finished  product  is 
adequately controlled by a combination of physico-chemical, biological and immunological methods.  
All methods used for routine control have been described and validated. 
Stability of finished product 
The stability results show a good stability profile for the finished product when stored at 2 – 8 °C for a 
shelf life as indicated in the SPC. 
A  storage  period  after  reconstitution  of  6  hours  at  2  –  8  °C  is  acceptable  provided  reconstitution  is 
performed under aseptic conditions.  
Pre-filled syringes with water for injections 
There are two manufacturers for sterile water for injection in pre-filled syringes described: Schering-
Plough,  Puerto  Rico,  for  the  fixed  needle  diluent  syringe  and  Vetter  Pharma,  Ravensburg,  Germany 
for the  Luer-Lok diluent syringe with removable needles.  Manufacture and  control are satisfactory 
for both manufacturers.

Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
In vitro studies: In human myelomonocytic cells, etanercept had a 50-fold higher affinity for TNF than 
for  TNFR.    It  binds  to  both  human  TNFα  and  Lymphotoxin  (LTα).    In  vitro  in  murine  L929  cells, 
etanercept inhibited the cytolytic activities of rhuTNF, rmuTNF, native TNF and LTα.  Etanercept did 
not affect complement activity of human serum. 
In  vivo  studies:  Etanercept  has  been  examined  for  its  effects  in  various  animal  model  systems  of 
inflammation.  In various models of arthritis, it reduced the overall arthritis incidence and the severity 
of the joint disease. Etanercept slowed down or retarded the onset and reduced the severity of arthritic 
disease. The inhibitory effects of etanercept appeared to be specific to those mediated by TNF and/or 
LTα. 
Etanercept was also evaluated as a TNF antagonist in several other preclinical models of disease such 
as  septic  shock,  cachexia,  allergic  asthma,  allograft  rejection  ,  response  to  vascular  injury  and 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis.  
General  and  safety  pharmacology  programme:    The  effect  of  etanercept  was  evaluated  in  several 
animal models of disease.  A conventional package of safety pharmacology was not conducted, but the 
need  for  this  was  obviated  by  the  investigations  conducted  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies.   
Only cardiovascular safety was assessed, and no change in  mean blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG 
was detected.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Single-dose and repeat-dose pharmacokinetics 
Single-dose  data  were  obtained  in  mice,  whilst  single  and  repeat  dose  data  were  obtained  in  rats, 
rabbits  and  cynomolgus  monkeys.    The  dose  levels  used  spanned  those  used  in  the  toxicity  studies. 
Etanercept  serum  concentrations  were  determined  by  an  ELISA  method,  which  may  detect  ELISA-
reactive degradation products as well as the parent compound. 
Absorption and distribution 
Absorption  was  slow  after  s.c.  administration,  with  maximum  serum  concentration  in  mice  and 
monkey  occurring  at  12  and  23  hours  post-dose  respectively.  Following  a  single  s.c.  dose,  
the  systemic  availability  of  etanercept  was  approximately  58  %  in  mice  and  73  %  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
Distribution  was  evaluated  in:  blood,  kidney,  liver,  lung,  heart,  spleen.    Following  single  s.c.  or  i.v. 
administration of radiolabelled etanercept to mice, radioactivity was detected in all tissues examined, 
with the greatest amount detected in blood.  Following single s.c. administration the blood tmax was the 
same  as the tissue tmax at  720  minutes.   Drug-related radioactivity was eliminated  more slowly from 
the blood (t½ 19 hours) than from any other tissue (t½ 5 to 10 hours).  Placental transfer and secretion 
into the milk were not investigated. 
Metabolism and excretion 
Since  etanercept  is  a  fusion  glycoprotein,  consisting  entirely  of  human  protein  components,  it  is 
expected to undergo proteolysis.  Hence studies were not conducted. 
Drug interactions 
In the CIA murine model and the rat study, etanercept did not appear to interact with methotrexate. 
Toxicokinetics 
The kinetics of etanercept were determined in dose-range finding and definitive reproductive toxicity 
studies  in  rat  and  rabbit  and  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  the  monkey.    The  development  of 
antibodies  to  etanercept  and  neutralising  antibodies  was  investigated  during  these  studies.   
4/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  development  of  antibodies  following  repeated  s.c.  administration  in  rabbit  and  monkey  was 
associated  with  apparent  reduction  of  serum  etanercept  concentrations.    This  could  be  due  to  the 
possible  interference  of  the  antibodies  with  the  ELISA  used  to  measure  the  serum  etanercept 
concentrations. 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of etanercept was investigated in mice, rats and rabbits following twice weekly 
s.c. administration.  The majority of mice, rats and rabbits developed neutralising antibodies prior to 
week 4.  
Toxicology 
All pivotal toxicity studies were conducted according to GLP requirements. 
Single dose toxicity 
Studies were conducted using the s.c. or i.v. routes of administration in mice and rats.  
Etanercept has a low acute toxicity.  There were no deaths in either species at the top dose levels of 
1000  mg/kg  i.v.  or  2000  mg/kg  s.c.    The  overt  signs  of  toxicity  which  occurred  at  all  dose  levels  
(i.v. route) but only at the top dose level (s.c. route) included ataxia, decreased motor activity, ptosis, 
dyspnoea and low carriage.  These signs subsided by 1 hour (i.v. route) or 4 hours (s.c. route) post-
dose.  
Repeat-dose toxicity  
Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  due  to  the  formation  of 
neutralising  antibodies  in  other  species.    Neutralising  antibodies  were  not  found  in  the  majority  of 
monkeys even after 26 weeks of treatment.  Enbrel did not illicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity 
in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive 
weeks at a dose of 15 mg/kg.  In the 26 week study the only treatment related effects were an increase 
in incidence and/or severity of eosinophil and lymphocyte infiltrates at the injection site.  
Reproductive toxicity 
Conventional  fertility  and  general  reproductive  and  perinatal/postnatal  studies  in  rodents  were  not 
performed because the majority of mice and rats developed neutralising antibodies within 2 to 3 weeks 
following initiation of twice weekly sc administration of etanercept.  
The  results  of  the  repeated-dose  studies  in  monkeys  revealed  no  treatment  related  effects  on  the 
reproductive  and accessory organs.  The potential for developmental toxicity was assessed in range-
finding  and  definitive  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits,  while  potential  perinatal  and  early  postnatal  effect 
were evaluated in rats.  The perinatal and early postnatal assessment was conducted as a part of the 
definitive teratology study.  There was no maternal toxicity at the highest dose in the developmental 
toxicity studies and there was no evidence of harm to the foetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept.  
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
Etanercept was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies.  
Carcinogenicity  studies  in  rodents  were  not  conducted  because  of  the  majority  of  mice  and  rats 
developed  neutralising  antibodies  within  2  to  3  weeks  following  initiation  of  twice  weekly  
s.c. administration. 
The lack of carcinogenicity studies was a concern for the CHMP, but the CHMP concluded that there 
are probably no meaningful animal studies which can further evaluate the theoretical risk of increased 
malignancies resulting from chronic TNF inactivation; therefore the company will conduct long-term 
surveillance for tumours in man. 
Local tolerance 
Treatment-related  reactions  at  the  injection  site  occurred  only  in  a  26  week  study  in  monkeys  and 
consisted  of  increased  eosinophil  and  lymphocyte  infiltrates.    The  incidence  and/or  severity  of 
injection site reactions increased in a dose related manner.  These changes were reversible following a 
4-week recovery period.

Part IV: Clinical aspects 
Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Etanercept  binds  to,  and  neutralises  the  biological  activity  of  tumour  necrosis  factor  (TNF)  and 
lymphotoxin, competitively inhibiting the binding of both soluble and membrane bound TNF to cell 
surface  receptors  and  therefore  preventing  the  TNF-mediated  signal  transduction  which  requires  the 
cross-linking of cell surface receptors.  
Pharmacodynamic studies  
The dose is derived from the outcomes of controlled pivotal studies.  Enbrel 25 mg administered twice 
weekly  as  a  subcutaneous  injection,  is  the  recommended  dose  for  optimal  therapeutic  response  in 
rheumatoid  arthritis;  alternatively  50  mg  administered  once  weekly  was  been  shown  to  be  safe  and 
effective in a subsequent clinical study. 25 mg administered once weekly gives a slower response and 
maybe less effective. 
Pharmacokinetics 
General 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  etanercept  have  been  studied  in  more  than  300  healthy  volunteers  and 
patients.  Population pharmacokinetic analysis was also performed on the combined data set.  
Serum  drug  levels  were  determined  by  a  validated  ELISA  method.  Specificity  of  the  ELISA  was 
demonstrated against a panel of human cytokines and cytokine receptors.  
Studies in healthy subjects and adults with rheumatoid arthritis  
After  administration  of  radio-labelled  etanercept,  nuclear  imaging  showed  distribution  of  the 
radioactivity to bone, liver, spleen and kidney, with no delay in clearance from any of these organs. 
Radioactivity was observed in the urine (probably amino acids/polypeptide fragments). Measurements 
of etanercept concentration in synovial fluid (one week before and 4 weeks after treatment) showed a 
rise in etanercept concentration, suggesting that etanercept penetrates the synovium. 
After  s.c.  administration  of  25  mg,  the  maximum  plasma  concentration  was  reached  after  48  hours.  
Bioavailability after s.c. administration is 76 %.  The volume of distribution is small (Vss = 10.4 l for a 
70 kg subject). Enbrel is slowly cleared from the body (t1/2 = 70 hours).  Clearance was reduced in RA 
patients (0.066 l/h) compared to healthy volunteers (0.11 l/h). The data  collected  are consistent with 
the  hypothesis  that  after  binding  with  TNF,  the  etanercept-TNF  complex  is  broken  down  by 
proteolytic processes in the body in the same way as other proteins; the by-products are either recycled 
or eliminated via urine or bile.  
Studies in special populations 
Renal and hepatic failure:  Based on a study of patients with acute organ failure (n = 15 acute renal 
failure patients, n = 9 acute hepatic failure patients), no change in dosage has been recommended in 
the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.  
Elderly patients:  No impact of advanced age was apparent.  The impact of age on pharmacokinetics 
was studied as a part of population pharmacokinetic analysis.   
Gender and ethnic origin:  No effect of gender or ethnic origin has been detected.  
Patients with polyarticular-course juvenile chronic arthritis:  The results of pharmacokinetic studies in 
69 patients in a paediatric trial showed that the average steady-state concentration was 2.1 ± 0.8 µg/ml. 
In absolute terms, children with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) had a reduced clearance compared to 
adults with RA.  After normalisation for weight, clearance was increased compared to that of adults 
6/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(effect particularly seen in youngest children).  Simulation of dosing suggests that while older children 
(10-17 years) have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children may have appreciably 
lower serum levels. 
Patients with chronic heart failure:   
Eleven  patients  with  CHF  were  studied  for  pharmacokinetics  after  repeated  etanercept  doses  of  
12  mg/m2.    The  pharmacokinetics  results  in  patients  with  CHF  in  this  study  were  similar  to  those 
observed in healthy subjects and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
In a large scale study, the pharmacokinetics of serum etanercept were evaluated in patients with CHF 
following  dosing  regimens  of  25  mg  twice  weekly,  once  weekly,  or  placebo  treatments.  The  mean 
steady-state  etanercept  serum  concentrations  following  25  mg  twice  weekly  observed  in  this  study 
were  comparable  to  those  observed  in  patients  with  rheumatoid  arthritis  following  the  same  dosing 
regimen. After 12 weeks of 25 mg twice weekly etanercept, the mean steady-state serum concentration 
was found to be 2.0 µg/mL, which was considered to be in a range comparable to that observed in the 
previous study. 
Interaction studies 
No  formal  drug  interaction  studies  were  conducted.    It  was  found  that  co-administration  of 
methotrexate (MTX) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of etanercept.  Human pharmacokinetics data 
on  the  effects  of  etanercept  on  MTX  are  not  available.    No  effect  of  etanercept  on  the  MTX 
pharmacokinetics has been found in animal studies.  
The cytochrome P450 system and other commonly used metabolic pathways are not involved in the 
metabolism  of  etanercept,  so  there  is  little  potential  of  metabolic  drug  interactions.    There  is  no 
scientific nor pharmacological reason that commonly prescribed medications used in the treatment of 
RA should interact with etanercept.  
In  studies  when  patients  received  concurrent  treatment  with  Enbrel  plus  anakinra,  a  higher  rate  of 
serious  infections  compared  to  Enbrel  alone  was  observed  and  2%  of  patients  (3/139)  developed 
neutropenia  (absolute  neutrophil  count  <  1000  /  mm3).  While  neutropenic,  one  patient  developed 
cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation 
Bioequivalence studies 
Bioequivalence was demonstrated between clinical study supplies and commercial product. 
Clinical efficacy 
Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile Chronic Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
After  a  small  pilot  study  (Phase  I,  study  16.0002),  1694  patients  with  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA),  of 
whom 1218 received Enbrel, have been included from 5 controlled studies (studies 16.0004, 16.0009, 
16.0014, 300-EU, and 16.0012).  Patients with RA also received Enbrel in open-label studies (studies 
16.0008, 16.0018, 16.0019, 16.0023, and 301-EU).  Sixty-nine (69) children were treated in a Juvenile 
Chronic Arthritis study (study 16.0016).  A total of 265 patients with psoriatic arthritis were treated in 
studies 16.0612 and 16.0030. 
To be included in the RA studies, patients were required to have active disease and to have failed at 
least  1 disease  modifying  anti  rheumatic  drug  (DMARD),  except  for  study  16.0012.    The  previous 
DMARD treatment was withdrawn for at least one month before the start of the treatment with Enbrel.  
In  all  cases,  concomitant  treatment  with  NSAIDs  and  low-dose  steroids  (≤  10  mg  prednisone  or 
equivalent) was allowed.  
Data were analysed using the ACR (American College of Rheumatology) response criteria as standard 
validated composite endpoints.  The ACR 20 response criterion requires at least 20 % improvement in 
7/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tender joint count and swollen joint count, plus 20 % improvement in at least three of the following 
five parameters:

physician’s global assessment of disease activity 
patient’s  assessment  of  physical  function  using  the  disability  domain  of  the  HAQ  (standard 
health assessment questionnaire) index 
acute phase reactant value, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP). 
- 
The ACR 50 % and ACR 70 % require respectively 50 % and 70 % improvement in joint counts and 
at least 50 % and 70 % improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining criteria.

The results from the primary endpoints suggest that Enbrel reduced the joint pain and joint swelling 
associated with RA with a consistent dose response relationship.  The first significant responses were 
seen  at  2  weeks  of  therapy.    Maximum  effect  was  reached  by  1  –  3  months.    An  increase  in  joint 
counts  was  seen  1  –  2  months  after  cessation  of  Enbrel  therapy,  indicating  that  continued 
administration of Enbrel is necessary to maintain a therapeutic response.

The  response  was  obtained  earlier  with  the  higher  dose.  The  consistent  results  indicating 
improvements  in  primary  and  secondary  end-points,  in  terms  of  both  numbers  of  patients  with 
reductions  in  symptoms  and  in  mean  change  from  baseline  for  assessment  of  symptoms,  signs  and 
laboratory correlates, suggest that Enbrel is effective treatment for RA over a period of 6 months.  
Study 16.0014 (Phase II/III) 
This was a double-blind, randomised, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial.  Fixed doses of Enbrel 
of 25 mg twice weekly in combination with previously used methotrexate (MTX) were tested against 
placebo plus MTX.  
The primary endpoint is 20 % ACR at 6 months.

The addition of Enbrel to MTX produced better results than MTX alone  using the ACR 20, ACR 50 
and  ACR  70  response  criteria.  Consistent  improvements  were  seen  in  primary  and  secondary 
endpoints,  in  terms  of  both  numbers  of  patients  with  reductions  in  symptoms,  and  in  mean  change 
from baseline for assessments of symptoms, signs and laboratory correlates.  
Although  the  addition  of  Enbrel  improved  the  response  shown  by  the  group  that  received  MTX  in 
monotherapy,  the  results  obtained  did  not  provide  enough  efficacy  and  safety  data  to  reach 
conclusions about the risk benefit of etanercept in combination of MTX. 
Study 300-EU (Phase III) 
This  was  a  double-blind,  randomised,  parallel,  placebo-controlled  study  of  559  patients.    All  dosing 
regimens (10 mg once a week, 10 mg twice a week, 25 mg once a week, or 25 mg twice a week) were 
significantly  more  efficacious  than  placebo  in  relieving  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  RA.   
The  differences  were  detected  with  a  great  degree  of  consistency  in  the  primary  efficacy  variables 
(percent  improvement  in  tender  and  swollen  joints  at  3  months)  as  well  as  the  secondary  variables.  
Statistical  separation  between  each  active  dose  group  and  the  placebo  group  began  at  week  1.   
The  response  was  further  improved  during  the  trial  and  peaked  at  the  3-month  time  point.   
Of the patients who received Enbrel 25 mg twice a week, 70% achieved an ACR 20% response rate, 
while only 47% of the patients who received the 10 mg once a week treatment registered an ACR 20% 
response.

The two intermediate Enbrel dose regimens produced similar results as the high-dose group but were 
associated  with  slightly  lower  ACR  20%  response  rates.    The  10  mg  once  a  week  treatment  was 
significantly inferior to 25 mg twice a week in terms of the primary variables.  The optimal therapeutic 
dose was determined to be 25 mg twice weekly. 
Subgroup analysis: Using the pooled population of studies 16.0004, 16.0009 and 16.0014, subgroups 
were  examined  for  response  by  factors  including  age,  sex,  positive  or  negative  rheumatoid  factor  at 
baseline,  whether  or  not  the  patient  was  withdrawn  from  DMARDs  at  baseline,  disease  severity  at 
baseline and whether or not concomitants NSAIDs, corticosteroids or MTX were used.  
No correlation to clinical response was observed for any subgroup. 
Patient disposition:  The rate of study completion was also studied as a surrogate measure of efficacy, 
as the vast majority of discontinuations in all groups were due to a lack of efficacy.  A significantly 
greater  percentage  of  Enbrel-treated  patients  completed  the  trials  compared  with  placebo  treated 
patients. 
Study 16.0012 (Phase III) 
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  compare  the  ability  of  two  fixed  doses  of  etanercept  and 
methotrexate  (MTX)  to  produce  improvement  from  baseline  in  rheumatoid  arthritis  activity  and 
decrease the rate of radiographic progression of joint damage. 
Study  16.0012  was  a  randomised,  multicentre,  double-placebo,  active-control  Phase  III  study 
comparing the efficacy of etanercept and MTX in adult patients with early (≤ 3 years) active RA who 
had  not  previously  received  MTX.    The  first  year  of  the  study  was  a  double-blind  period  in  which  
632 patients received the study drug as follows: etanercept 10 mg twice weekly, n = 208; etanercept 
25  mg  twice  weekly,  n  =  207;  and  MTX  7.5  escalated  rapidly  to  20  mg  once  weekly,  n  =  217.   
The  study  remained  double-blinded  until  the  last  patient  enrolled  had  completed  12  months  of 
evaluation. 
Patients  still  receiving  MTX  or  etanercept  after  the  study  had  been  unblinded,  and  who  had  not 
experienced  adverse  events  thought  to  be  associated  with  the  study  drug,  could  continue  open-label 
treatment  with  the  study  drug  to  which  they  were  randomised.  Patients  who  discontinued  study 
medication  could  remain  in  the  study  and  received  standard  (non-study)  therapy,  except  etanercept. 
These patients were included in the statistical analysis. 
Patients were at least 18 years of age and fulfilled the 1987 American Rheumatism Association criteria 
for the classification of RA. 
Radiographic  progression  was  a  primary  endpoint  in  this  study.  Total  Sharp  score  (TSS)  was 
calculated  by  adding  each  patient’s  erosion  and  joint  space  narrowing  scores.    The  primary  clinical 
endpoint for  the double-blind  portion  of the trial  was based on the ACR-N response  criteria.  Study 
16.0012  was  designed  to  allow  testing  of  disability  and  quality  of  life  as  conditional  primary 
endpoints.  
Efficacy Results: 
Evaluation of radiographic results showed that the changes in joint space narrowing (JSN) scores from 
baseline  to  6,  12  and  24  months  of  treatment  did  not  differ  significantly  between  the  3  treatment 
groups. Significantly more patients in the etanercept 25mg group (72%) than in the MTX group (60%) 
had  unchanged  erosion  scores  at  12  months.    Enbrel  25mg  was  significantly  superior  to  MTX  for 
erosion  scores  at  both  12  and  24  months.  The  differences  in  TSS  and  JSN  were  not  statistically 
significant between MTX and Enbrel 25mg. (please refer to the graph below).

A  significantly  superior  effect  of  etanercept  25  mg  was  demonstrated  for  ACR-N  compared  with 
MTX; the mean ACR-N AUC at 6 months being 33% greater in etanercept 25 mg patients compared

Efficacy  and  safety  of  50  mg  etanercept  once  weekly  dosing  regimen  compared  to  25  mg  twice

Study16.0036 
Study 16.0036 was  a  double blind,  randomised, active- and placebo-controlled  study to evaluate the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  a  50  mg  etanercept  once  weekly  dosing  regimen  compared  to  the  initially 
approved regimen of 25 mg twice weekly.   
Patients  with  active  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  were  allowed  to  receive  concomitant  methotrexate 
during  the  study  provided  the  doses  were  stable  for  at  least  28  days  prior  to  study  start.  
Randomisation  was  stratified  by  usage  of  methotrexate  at  baseline  based  on  a  1:4:3  allocation  to 
receive either placebo, etanercept 50 mg once weekly, or etanercept 25 mg twice weekly, respectively. 
Treatment  was  administered  twice  weekly,  with  patients  receiving  2  injections  on  the  first 
administration  day  (dose  1)  and  1  injection  on  the  second  administration  day  (dose  2)  each  week  to 
maintain  blinding  (patients  treated  with  etanercept  also  received  1 injection  of  placebo  each  week).  
After  8  weeks  of  blinded  study  drug  treatment,  patients  in  the  placebo  group  received  etanercept  
25 mg twice weekly in a blinded fashion for the remaining 8 weeks of the study. 
Aim of the study 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate efficacy (ACR 20) and safety of etanercept 50 once 
weekly in comparison with placebo at Week 8. 
The  secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  etanercept  50  mg  once  weekly 
administered for 16 weeks, the comparative effectiveness of etanercept 50 mg once weekly and 25 mg 
twice  weekly  (ACR  20  response  after  8  weeks  of  treatment).In  addition,  ACR  20  response  after  
16  weeks  and  improvement  from  baseline  in  individual  ACR  criteria  after  8  and  16  weeks  were 
evaluated.

Patient population 
A total of 420 patients were randomised to receive one of the following treatments: etanercept 50 mg 
once  weekly  (214),  etanercept  25  mg  twice  weekly (153)  or  placebo  (53).Three  hundred  eighty  one 
(381) patients (91%) completed 16 weeks of study treatment 
Efficacy results 
The safety and efficacy profiles of the two Enbrel treatment regimens were comparable in their effect 
on signs and symptoms of RA. 
Use of etanercept in combination with methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of adult RA, including, 
the inhibition of the progression of disease-associated structural damage as measured by X-ray 
Study  308 
The  aim  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy,  including  radiographic  changes,  of 
etanercept alone, MTX alone, and the combination of etanercept and MTX in patients with active RA 
who have had inadequate response to at least one DMARD. 
In  addition,  this  study  evaluated  the  pharmacokinetics  of  etanercept  with  and  without  concomitant 
MTX. 
Study design 
This was a multicentre, double-blind study, which consisted of 2 periods.  
Period 1 was a 52-week, randomised, double-blind, parallel design with 3 treatment groups: etanercept 
only (25 mg twice weekly), MTX only (7.5-20 mg weekly), or etanercept and MTX in combination. 
Period 2 is a double-blind extension phase of variable duration (up to 88 weeks), during which patients 
continue  to  receive  the  same  treatment  as  in  Period  1  until  an  administrative  decision  is  made 
regarding closure of the study. 
Study population 
Six hundred and eighty six (686) patients with active RA (who failed previous DMARD therapy other 
than MTX) were randomised to receive one of the following treatments: 
etanercept 25 mg SC injections twice weekly or methotrexate 7.5 – 20 mg once weekly or  
etanercept 25 mg SC injections twice weekly + methotrexate 7.5-20 mg once weekly. 
In addition, all patients received folic acid supplementation of 5 mg twice per week. 
In  total,  682  patients  were  treated  and  analysed  for  safety  (four  patients  did  not  receive  study 
medication) and 522 patients (77% of 682 patients) completed Period 1 (approximately 52 weeks) of 
the study.  
Efficacy parameters 
The primary clinical endpoint was the ACR-N AUC over the first 24 weeks.  This was chosen as the 
primary endpoint for the purpose of comparison to study 16.0012. The AUC mean response over an 
interval  uses  all of the data in that interval rather than  any specific point and is claimed to  be  more 
sensitive to treatment differences than any single point estimate.  
Secondary measures of clinical efficacy were also included: ACR 20, 50 and 70 response rates, DAS 
index  (Disease  Activity  Score),  HAQ  (Health  Assessment  Questionnaire),  Components  of  ACR 
response (Painful and swollen joint counts, Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Physician and patient 
global  assessment  of  disease  activity,  HAQ,  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  (ESR)  (Westergren),  
C-reactive  protein  (CRP))  and  other  disease  activity  variables  (patient’s  general  health  on  a  VAS, 
EuroQoL  VAS,  rheumatoid  factor  (RF),  duration  of  morning  stiffness  in  minutes).The  primary 
radiographic  endpoint  was  the  change  from  baseline  in  total  Sharp  score  (TSS)  at  12  months. 
Radiographs of hands, wrists and forefeet were taken at baseline, week 24, and week 52, or the final 
study visit.

The modified Sharp and Van der Heijde method was used to evaluate radiographs. The evaluation of 
erosions  was  in  a  scale  from  0  to  10,  and  each  integer  increased  in  the  scale  approximated  a  10% 
increase in the area of each joint that is eroded. JSN was scored on a scale from 0 to 4. 
Secondary  radiographic  endpoints  included:  Change  from  baseline  in  TSS  at  6  months,  in  total 
erosions  at  6  and  12  months,  in  total  joint  space  narrowing  at  6  and  12  months,  number  of  eroded 
joints  at  6  and  12  months,  non-progression  (TSS  change  ≤0.5,  ≤3.0,  and  <SDD  [smallest  detectable 
difference]) at 6 and 12 months. Results 
 The  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  ACR-N  AUC  over  24 weeks,  was  greater  for  both  the  combination 
etanercept + MTX group and etanercept group compared with the MTX group (p<0.01).   
Additionally,  ACR-N  AUC  was  greater  for  the  combination  etanercept  +  MTX  group  versus  the 
etanercept group (p<0.01). The table below presents the mean ACR-N AUC at 24 weeks for the ITT 
population.  There  were  significant  differences  in  ACR-N  AUC  among  the  3 treatment  groups  at 
24 weeks.

Clinical Studies in Special Populations 
Study 16.0016: study in children with Juvenile Chronic Arthritis (JCA) 
In the first part of this study, 69 children with JCA received Enbrel subcutaneously twice weekly at a 
dose  of  0.4  mg/kg  (max.  25  mg).    The  inclusion  criteria  were  active  disease  with  at  least  5  swollen 
joints  and  at  least  3  tender/painful  joints,  and  disease  refractory  to  MTX  or  child  resistant  to  MTX.   
At the end of the 90 day open-label phase, 51 children who met pre-defined validated response criteria 
were randomised either to continue treatment with Enbrel or to receive matching injection of placebo 
for either 4 months or until disease flare occurred.  The response criteria were defined as a least 30 % 
improvement in at least 3 of the following criteria, and with a 30 % or greater worsening in not more 
than  1  of  these  criteria:  1.  Physician’s  global  assessment  ;  2.  Patient/parent’s  global  assessment  ;  
3. Number of active joints ; 4. Number of joints with limitation of movement with pain or tenderness ; 
5. Childhood health assessment questionnaire and 6. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.  At the end of the 
double-blind  trial,  28  %  (7/25)  of  children  randomised  to  Enbrel  had  suffered  a  disease  flare, 
compared to 81 % (21/26) of the children on placebo treatment.  Median time to flare was ≥ 116 days 
for children on Enbrel versus 28 days for children on placebo.  The response to the criteria described 
above was maintained in the children treated with Enbrel for 4 months, but worsening for all criteria 
was  seen  in  children  treated  with  placebo.    These  results  show  good  evidence  that  the  response  to 
Enbrel  in  JCA  is  maintained  with  continued  treatment.  Given  the  ethical  limitations  to  undertaking 
placebo-controlled  trials  with  Enbrel  in  children,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  this  provided  acceptable 
evidence for the efficacy of Enbrel in the indication Juvenile Chronic Arthritis.  
Studies in adults with Psoriatic Arthritis 
Two studies are discussed to consider efficacy for Enbrel in the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA) in adults. A brief description of the studies is presented below. 
14/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One Phase II study (16.0612) and one Phase III study (16.0030) have been presented as evidence of 
efficacy.  The Phase III study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study 
in  205  patients  with  active  PsA  or  plaque  psoriasis.    Randomisation  was  stratified  by  concomitant 
methotrexate (MTX) use. The double-blind phase of the trial lasted 24 weeks and was followed by an 
open-label extension (OLE) phase in which all eligible patients were treated with Enbrel.  The primary 
endpoint was ACR20 at Week 12.  A conditional primary endpoint, only to be tested if a statistically 
significant  effect  was  observed  on  ACR20,  was  Total  Sharp  score  (a  measure  of  radiographic 
progression)  after  12  months.    Effects  on  psoriasis  were  investigated  using  the  Psoriasis  Area  and 
Severity  Index  (PASI)  and  target  lesion  response  to  therapy.  The  ITT  population  was  used  for  the 
primary efficacy analysis.  The psoriasis endpoints were assessed in the subgroup of patients who had 
at least 3% body surface area affected by psoriasis at baseline 
The  Phase  II  study  was  of  similar  design.    However,  the  double-blind  period  was  only  of  12  weeks 
duration  and  the  primary  endpoint  was  PsA  response  criteria  (PsARC)  at  Week  12.    Sixty  patients 
were included in this Phase II study. 
Efficacy Results: 
Both  trials  achieved  their  primary  and  secondary  objectives,  showing  highly  statistically  significant 
differences compared with placebo on both PsA and psoriasis endpoints.  No treatment by MTX strata 
interactions  were  observed.    The  submitted  studies  demonstrated  that  etanercept  is  more  efficacious 
than placebo in improving clinical symptoms and signs of arthritis and psoriasis in patients with PsA 
over a period of 24 weeks.

During the 24-week open-label extension of study 16.0612, the PsARC response was maintained in  
26 (87%) patients who previously received etanercept. In 28 patients who received placebo in the 
double-blind phase, 21 (75%) achieved the PsARC at 36 weeks. 
Studies in adults with Ankylosing Spondylitis 
Study16.0037  
This study was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of etanercept in adult patients with AS as diagnosed by the Modified New York 
criteria. The planned enrolment was 200 patients, 100 patients in each treatment group.   
Adults  with  active  AS  were  eligible  for  participation.  Patients  who  met  the  eligibility  criteria  were 
randomly  assigned  to  receive  placebo  or  etanercept,  25 mg  administered  SC  twice  weekly,  for  
24 weeks.  The randomisation was stratified on the basis of concomitant DMARDs at baseline.  
Efficacy and safety evaluations were performed at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24. 
Study 311-EU  
This study was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of adult patients with AS. The planned enrolment

Adults  with  active  AS  were  eligible  for  participation.  Patients  who  met  the  eligibility  criteria  were 
randomly  assigned  to  receive  placebo  or  etanercept,  25 mg  administered  SC  twice  weekly,  for 
12 weeks.    The  randomisation  was  stratified  on  the  basis  of  concomitant  DMARDs  at  baseline.   
The  study  consisted  of  a  screening  period  of  up  to  4  weeks  followed  by  a  12-week  double-blind 
treatment period.   
Efficacy and safety evaluations were performed at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
In addition to these 2 multi-centre studies, there was an earlier single-centre study, 16.0626. 
Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the 2 phase 3 studies (16.0037 and 311-EU) was the proportion of 
patients who achieved ASAS 20% response criteria at 12 weeks (≥20% improvement in at least 3 of 
the 4 Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) domains patient global assessments, back pain, 
BASFI,  and  inflammation  and  absence  of  deterioration  in  the  remaining  domain.    ASAS  50  and  70 
responses used the same criteria with a 50% improvement or a 70% improvement, respectively. Study 
16.0037 also had a conditional primary endpoint of the ASAS 20% response criteria at 24 weeks if the 
primary endpoint established efficacy at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included: ASAS 20% at time 
points  other  than  the  final  visit,  ASAS  50%  and  70%  responses  at  all  time  points,  individual 
components  of  ASAS  response  criteria,  BASDAI  and  its  components,  physician  (assessor)  global 
assessment,  spinal  mobility,  peripheral  joint  counts,  acute-phase  reactants,  and  partial  remission  of 
AS. 
Efficacy Results 
Study 16.0037 
Compared  to  placebo,  treatment  with  Enbrel  resulted  in  significant  improvements  in  the  ASAS  20, 
ASAS 50 and ASAS 70 as early as 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy.

Among patients with ankylosing spondylitis who received Enbrel, the clinical responses were apparent 
at the time  of the first  visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months  of therapy. Responses 
were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant therapies at baseline. 
Similar results were obtained in the 2 smaller ankylosing spondylitis trials. The studies had different 
duration  of  treatment,  the  Phase  II  study  (16.0626)  being  for  16  weeks,  the  Phase  III  multi-national

study  (16.0037)  was  for  24  weeks  and  the  European  study  (308)  for  12  weeks.    Response  was 
maintained over all these periods. 
The  individual  components  of  the  ASAS  score  and  other  associated  subjective  endpoints  also  all 
showed a consistent and significant benefit for etanercept.  The only component which regularly failed 
to show any benefit was the swollen joints score.  This was considered to be due to the low score at 
baseline and the small number of patients who actually presented with swollen joints, which did not 
seem to be a common component in the patients chosen for these studies.

Clinical studies in Plaque Psoriasis 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics in patients with psoriasis have been evaluated in the Studies 20021632, 20021639, 
20021642, and in the ongoing open-label Study 20030115. 
Study 20021632: Serum samples for PK analysis were obtained from all patients before study start, at 
Weeks 12 and 24, and at the 30-day follow-up visit (for patients who discontinued early).  
The concentrations of Enbrel at Weeks 12 (1591 ± 885 ng/mL) and 24 (1634 ±1141 ng/mL) in patients 
with  psoriasis  were  similar  to  the  concentrations  found  in  patients  with  RA.  The  variability  in  the 
measured  concentrations  was  high.  The  Enbrel  concentrations  did  not  change  significantly  between 
Weeks 12 and 24, suggesting that Enbrel steady state was reached by Week 12. 
Study 20021639: Serum samples were obtained from all patients before study start and at Weeks 2, 4, 
8, 12, and 24. The concentration time profiles showed dose proportionality, with the concentrations in 
the  Enbrel  50  mg  twice  weekly  group  approximately  twice  as  high  as  the  values  measured  in  the 
Enbrel 25 mg twice weekly group and almost 6 times higher than the levels obtained after the 25 mg 
once  weekly  dose.  The  variability  in  the  measured  concentrations  in  the  present  study  was  high, 
resulting in coefficient of variation (CV) values well in excess of 50%. 
Study 20021642: Serum samples were obtained from patients before the study start and at Weeks 2, 4, 
8,  and  12.  The  concentration-time  profiles  of  the  active  treatment  groups  demonstrated  dose 
proportionality,  with  the  concentrations  in  the  50  mg  twice  weekly  group  approximately  twice  the 
values measured in the 25 mg twice weekly group. 
Conclusion:  The  pharmacokinetics  of  Enbrel  in  patients  with  psoriasis  were  comparable  across  the 
studies  and  showed  considerable  inter-  and  intra-  variability.  All  doses  produced  accumulation  after 
repeated administration, with accumulation ratios ranging from 1.06 to 2.61. 
There was a clear dose proportionality after single dose administration and at steady state for 25 mg 
twice weekly and 50 mg twice weekly dosage regimens.

Clinical Efficacy 
The  efficacy  data  were  obtained  from  the  results  of    3  placebo-controlled  studies:  200221632, 
20021639,  and  20021642.  The  three  studies  presented  are  similar  in  many  regards.    Each  was 
multicenter,  randomised,  double  blind  and  placebo-controlled.    No  active  controls  were  used  in  the 
trial programme.  Each trial had the same primary endpoint, proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 
and  analysed  the  data  using  a  modified  ITT  population,  including  only  those  patients  who  received 
study medication.  Sample sizes and other pertinent design features are presented in the table below.

Study 20021632 
Study design 
It was a double blind, randomised study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Enbrel in patients with 
chronic plaque psoriasis.  The study data was analysed at Week 12 and further treatment (Week 12 to 
Week 24) remained blinded to all patients and study personnel. Patients who completed 24 weeks of 
therapy  were  followed  up  (off  study  treatment)  until  their  PASI  returned  to  at  least  75%  of  their 
baseline PASI or other systemic psoriasis therapy was started. 
Efficacy parameters 
The primary endpoint was of the proportions of patients who achieved the Psoriasis Area and Severity 
Index (PASI) 75 response at Week 12 (at least a 75% improvement in the PASI score from baseline). 
The  secondary  endpoints  were:  PASI  at  Week  24,  target  lesion  response  to  study  treatment  at 
Weeks12  and  24,  Dermatologist  Static  Global  Assessment  of  target  lesion  score  distribution, 
Dermatologist Static Global Assessment of psoriasis score distribution. 
Additional  outcome  measures  were  quality  of  life  (QOL)  assessed  by  the  Medical  Outcomes  Study 
Short-Form  Health,  Survey-36  (SF-36),  Dermatology  QOL  assessed  by  Dermatology  Life  Quality 
Index (DLQI) at Week 12, Patient Global Assessment at Week 12. In addition, in a subset of patients, 
skin biopsies were to be performed at baseline and 12 weeks to measure epidermal thickness, Ki-67 
expression, and keratin 16 expression. 
Patient population 
All patients had chronic plaque psoriasis involving 10% of body surface area (BSA). Patientswho had 
received  at  least  one  previous  systemic  psoriasis  therapy  (psoralen  ultraviolet  A  phototherapy 
[PUVA],  ultraviolet  B  phototherapy  [UVB],  oral  retinoids,  cyclosporine,  or  methotrexate)  were 
randomised to receive placebo or Enbrel 25 mg twice weekly for 24 weeks. 
A  total  of  112  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment  (57  received  Enbrel  and  
55 received placebo) were evaluated for safety and efficacy. Fifty three patients (93%) in the Enbrel 
group completed 12 weeks of study treatment, compared to  40 (73%) patients  in the placebo group.  
At Week 24, 48/57 (84%) patients in the Enbrel group completed 24 weeks of study drug, compared to 
18/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12/55 (22%) of patients in the placebo group. The groups were well matched in most characteristics of 
demography and disease history. 
Efficacy results 
Primary  efficacy  endpoint:  At  Week  12,  17  (30%)  of  patients  in  the  Enbrel  group  achieved  an 
improvement in PASI 75, as compared with 1 (2%) patient in the placebo group. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: At Week 24, 32 patients (56%) in the Enbrel group achieved PASI 75, 
compared  to  3  patients  (5%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Differences  between  the  groups  were  also 
statistically significant from Week 4 for the PASI 50 and for the percent improvement from baseline 
in PASI responses, and in all comparisons by Week 12.  
Patients in the Enbrel group showed significantly greater improvements from baseline in all measures 
of target lesion response, compared to patients in the placebo group.  
Mean Patient Global Psoriasis assessments improved significantly more in the Enbrel group (62.2%) 
at  Week  24  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (6.7%).  Mean  Dermatologist  Global  Assessments  were 
also significantly better in patients in the Enbrel group than patients in the placebo group. Patients in 
the Enbrel group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in the DLQI score, compared to the 
placebo group. 
Skin  biopsies  performed  in  31  patients  (placebo-14,  Enbrel-17)  at  baseline  and  at  Week  12  showed 
improvements in skin pathology findings in the Enbrel group compared to the placebo group. 
Discontinuations due to lack of efficacy: At Week 24, 60% (33/55) of patients in the placebo group 
had discontinued due to lack of efficacy, compared to 5/57 (9%) of patients in the Enbrel group. 
Follow-up:  The  relapse  of  psoriasis  signs  and  symptoms  was  gradual.  Patients  in  the  Enbrel  group  
(n = 12) who achieved the PASI 75 at Week 24 in the controlled study and who entered the extended 
follow-up  observation  period  (off  study  treatment)  had  a  mean  (median)  of  22.6  (26.4)  weeks 
following their last dose of study treatment before they reached at least 75% of their baseline PASI or 
started other systemic therapy. 
Study 20021639 
Study design 
It was a dose-ranging study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Enbrel 50 mg twice weekly, 25 mg 
twice weekly and 25 mg once weekly in comparison with placebo. 
Part 1 was a 24-week double-blind treatment period (Day 1 to Week 24) and Part 2 was a treatment 
withdrawal, re-treatment and open-label follow-up period (from Week 24). 
Part 1 
Patients  were  randomised  to  one  of  the  following  treatments:  Enbrel  50  mg  twice  weekly,  Enbrel  
25 mg twice weekly, Enbrel 25 mg once weekly, placebo.  
At the end of the double-blind treatment period (Week 24), all patients who completed treatment were 
categorised  as  responders  (patients  having  an  improvement  of  >50%  from  baseline  PASI)  or 
incomplete responders.  
Part 2 
At Week 24, responders discontinued study treatment and were followed until they had a relapse (loss 
of 50% or more of the improvement in the PASI score between baseline and Week 24). After a relapse 
these  responders  started  re-treatment  with  Enbrel  at  the  same  dose  regimen  (50  mg  twice  weekly,  
25  mg  twice  weekly,  or  25  mg  once  weekly)  they  received  during  the  first  double-blind  treatment 
period. 
After 24 weeks of blinded re-treatment, all patients started an open-label Enbrel treatment with Enbrel 
25 mg twice weekly for the remainder of the study (up to 72 weeks). 
Incomplete responders started an open-label Enbrel 25 mg twice weekly from Week 24.  At Week 36, 
these patients were evaluated whether they had become responders (improvement from baseline PASI 
of >50%).  If they had not responded, patients were given the option to discontinue the study.  Patients 
who  responded  at  Week  36  continued  open-label  treatment  with  Enbrel  25mg  twice  weekly  up  to  
72 weeks.  
19/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
After  Week  72,  all  patients  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment  were  invited  to 
participate in a long-term, open-label Study 20030115 (Enbrel 50 mg once weekly). 
Efficacy parameters 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 
75 (at least a 75% improvement in the PASI score from baseline) at Week 12.  
Secondary endpoints included: the proportions of patients achieving the PASI 50, PASI 75, and PASI 
90,  and  the  mean  percent,  improvements  in  the  PASI  score  from  baseline  at  all  visits  at  which  the 
PASI  was  measured,  Dermatologist  Static  Global  Assessment,  DLQI,  Patient  Global  Assessment,  
EQ-5D-FT (visual analogue scale 0 to 100).  
Efficacy results 
Part 1  
Patient population: All patients had chronic plaque psoriasis involving at least 10% of body surface, 
with  a  minimal  PASI  score  of  10,  and  had  received  or  had  been  a  candidate  to  receive  systemic 
psoriasis therapy (in the opinion of the investigator).  
A  total  of  652  patients  were  randomised  and  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment. 
Demographics  and  disease  history  were  well  balanced  across  treatment  groups.  Seventy-six  percent 
(76%)  of  the  patients  had  received  prior  systemic  psoriasis  therapy  or  phototherapy.  Twenty  two 
percent (22%) of patients had psoriatic arthritis.  
Primary  efficacy  endpoint:  A  significantly  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  each  of  the  three  Enbrel 
groups achieved the PASI 75 response at Week 12, compared with the placebo group.   
At Week 4, the response rates between the Enbrel 50 mg twice weekly group and the placebo group 
were statistically significantly different.  At Week 8, the response rates were statistically significantly 
different for the Enbrel 25 mg twice weekly group, compared with the placebo group.    
At Week 12, the response rates for the PASI 75 were significantly different between the Enbrel 25 mg 
once weekly group (14%) and the Enbrel 25  mg twice weekly group (34%) and between the 25  mg 
twice weekly group (34%) and the 50 mg twice weekly group (49%). 
Secondary endpoints: From Week 2, statistically significant and dose dependent differences were seen 
between  each  Enbrel  group  and  placebo  for:  mean  percent  improvement  in  the  PASI  response, 
Dermatologist Static Global Assessment, Patient Global Assessment, and DLQI. 
In all three Enbrel groups, the proportions of patients achieving the PASI 50, PASI 75, and PASI 90 
responses increased over 24 weeks study duration.  
Patients  in  the  placebo  group  who  received  Enbrel  after  Week  12  had  similar  improvements  in  the 
PASI response at Week 24 as those achieved by the Enbrel 25 mg twice weekly group at Week 12.  
Patients  in  each  of  the  Enbrel  groups  continued  to  improve  from  week  12  to  week  24  for  all 
dermatologist and patient reported secondary endpoints. 
Discontinuations  due  to  lack  of  efficacy:  Eighteen  patients  discontinued  from  the  study  (Day  0  to 
Week 24) due to lack of efficacy (7 patients in the placebo group, 6 in the 25 mg once weekly group,  
2 in the 25 twice weekly group and 3 in the 50 mg twice weekly group). 
Subgroup  analyses:  The  subgroup  analyses  by  baseline  PASI  score,  previous  systemic  therapy  or 
phototherapy and presence of psoriatic arthritis confirmed the primary efficacy analysis. For patients 
above  the  median  BSA  at  baseline  and  in  patients  in  the  highest  quartiles  of  weight,  the  PASI  75 
response at Week 12 was lower, though still in favour of Enbrel. 
Part 2 
Patient population: Of the 652 patients who received at least one dose of study treatment, 573 patients 
completed  24  weeks  of  study  treatment.    Of  those,  409  patients  were  categorised  as  responders  and 
160  patients  were  classified  as  incomplete  responders.  Of  the  409  responders,  62  patients  withdrew 
from  the  study  before  relapse  of  their  psoriasis  (46  due  to  early  study  closure);  347  patients 
experienced a relapse (loss of >50% of PASI improvement obtained between baseline and Week 24) 
and entered the re-treatment period (5 patients withdrew before re-treatment).  Two hundred and three 
20/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
patients  (203) completed  24  weeks of  blinded  re-treatment and  139  patients discontinued  during the 
re-treatment  period  (118  due  to  early  study  closure).  One  hundred  and  sixty  (160)  of  incomplete 
responders  entered  the  open-label  period  (3  patients  discontinued  before  receiving  open-label  study 
drug).  Three (3) patients completed 48 weeks of open-label treatment.  
12 Weeks 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference between the PASI 75 score achieved after 12 weeks 
of re-treatment and the PASI score achieved after 12 weeks of initial treatment. 
A total of 297 patients completed 12 weeks of blinded re-treatment (87 patients in the Enbrel 50 mg 
twice weekly group, 73 in the 25 mg twice weekly group, 63 in the 25 mg once weekly group, and 74 
in the placebo/Enbrel 25 mg twice weekly group). The PASI 75 was achieved by 19%, 40%, and 45% 
in  the  25  mg  once  weekly,  25  mg  twice  weekly,  and  50  mg  twice  weekly  groups  respectively,  at  
Week 12 of re-treatment. The absolute mean difference between the initial Week 12 response and the 
re-treatment Week 12 response for all re-treatment groups was -0.5. 
The proportion of PASI 75 responders at Week 12 of re-treatment relative to re-treatment baseline was 
significantly lower: 22%, 13%, 19% and 24% for patients treated with placebo/25 mg twice weekly, 
25 mg once weekly, 25 mg twice weekly and 50 mg twice weekly, respectively. 
24 Weeks 
A total of 134 patients completed at least 24 weeks of blinded re-treatment (43 patients in the 25 mg 
once weekly group, 41 in the 25 mg twice weekly group, and 50 patients in the Enbrel 50 mg twice 
weekly group).  The difference mean in PASI scores was -1.5, indicating that most patients had PASI 
scores approximately 1 to 2 points worse at Week 24 of re-treatment relative to their PASI scores at 
Week 24 of the initial active treatment. Overall, 113 (84%) patients achieved a PASI 50 response at 
Week 24 of the re-treatment period. 
At  Week  24  of  re-treatment,  the  PASI  75  was  achieved  by  19%,  49%,  and  58%  in  the  25  mg  once 
weekly, 25 mg twice weekly, and 50 mg twice weekly groups respectively.  The results were similar 
to that observed after 24 weeks of blinded treatment. 
Open-label  period  for  incomplete  responders  One  hundred  and  fifty  seven  (157)  patients  who 
improved  <  50%  from  their  baseline  PASI  score  and  were  categorised  as  incomplete  responders  at 
Week  24  of  the  initial  double-blind  period  received  open-label  Enbrel  at  a  dose  of  25  mg  twice 
weekly. At the end of  12 weeks of open-label treatment, 62 out of  112  patients achieved a PASI 50 
response.  
Study 20021642 
Study design 
It  was  a  double  blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
Enbrel  in  patients  with  chronic  plaque  psoriasis.    The  study  consisted  of  2  parts:  a  double-blind 
treatment period (Day 1 to Week 12) and an open-label treatment period (Weeks 13 to 48). 
Part 1 
Patients  were  randomised  to  one  of  the  following  treatments:  Enbrel  50  mg  twice  weekly,  Enbrel  
25  mg  twice  weekly,  and  placebo  twice  weekly.    Patients  were  stratified  at  randomisation  into  two 
groups: patients who had previously received systemic therapy or phototherapy and patients who had 
received no systemic or phototherapy.  
Part 2 
From  Week  12  to  Week  48  visit,  all  patients  received  Enbrel  25  mg  twice  weekly  in  an  open-label 
fashion.  The study was closed early during the open-label period of the study to expedite enrolment to 
Study 20030115. All patients completed 36 weeks of treatment. 
Efficacy parameters 
The primary endpoint for this study was achievement of PASI 75 at Week 12.  
Secondary endpoints included PASI 50 and PASI 90, Dermatologist Static Global Assessment, DLQI, 
Patient Global Assessment. 
Other  endpoints  included:  Medical  Outcomes  Study  -  Short  Form-36  (SF-36)  Health  Survey,  and 
discontinuations from the study due to lack of efficacy.

Patient population 
All  patients  had  chronic  plaque  psoriasis  involving  at  least  10%  of  body  surface,  a  minimal  PASI 
score  of  10,  and  had  received  or  had  been  a  candidate  to  receive  systemic  psoriasis  therapy  (in  the 
opinion of the investigator). 
Of the 611 randomised patients, 28 patients withdrew or were excluded before receiving blinded study 
drug: 11 withdrew consent, 12 were determined ineligible for the study, and 5 were lost to follow-up. 
A total of 583 patients received at least one dose of study treatment and were analysed for safety and 
efficacy.  The  groups  were  well  matched  in  characteristics  of  demography  and  disease  history  at 
baseline; 89% of patients had received prior psoriasis therapy (58% received UVB, 91% used topical 
steroids,  28%  received  an  investigational  product,  25%  received  oral  retinoids,  16%  received 
cyclosporine, 34% received PUVA, and 38% received methotrexate). Twenty-six percent of patients 
had psoriatic arthritis.  
Efficacy results 
Part 1 
Of  the  583  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  blinded  study  treatment  559  patients  (96%) 
completed 12 weeks of the study. 
Primary  efficacy  endpoint:  The  PASI  75  response  was  achieved  in  each  of  the  Enbrel  groups 
compared  with  the  placebo  group  at  Week  12.    At  Week  4,  the  response  rates  were  statistically 
significantly different between the Enbrel 50 mg twice weekly group and the placebo group. At Week 
8, the response rates were statistically significantly different for the Enbrel 25 mg twice weekly group 
compared with the placebo. 
Response  to  Enbrel  therapy  was  dose-dependent.  At  Week  12,  the  response  rates  for  the  PASI  75 
response were statistically significantly different between the Enbrel 50 mg twice weekly group (49%) 
and the 25 mg twice weekly group (34%). 
Secondary  endpoints:  At  Week  12,  statistically  significant  improvements  were  seen  in  both  Enbrel 
groups  in  mean  percent  improvement  in  the  PASI  score,  in  the  Dermatologist  Static  Global 
Assessment,  in  the  DLQI  and  in  the  Patient  Global  Assessment  of  psoriasis,  compared  with  the 
placebo group.  The improvements in secondary endpoints were dose-dependent. 
Subgroup analyses: The subgroup results for the PASI 75 response at Week 12 by baseline age, and 
previous systemic therapy were similar to the primary analysis (except for the age group > 65 years).  
The results in the group of patients > 65 years old were difficult to interpret due to small number of 
patients. 
Part 2 
Five hundred and fifty seven (557) patients received at  least one  dose of Enbrel at a dose  of  25  mg 
twice weekly during the open-label period. 
The proportions of patients achieving the PASI 50, PASI 75, and PASI 90 responses increased during 
the  open-label  period  for  patients  in  the  original  placebo  and  Enbrel  25  mg twice  weekly  groups. 
Because of the early closure of the study, a majority of patients discontinued between weeks 36 and  
48 in the open-label period. The PASI 75 response rate remained relatively constant between weeks 12 
and 36 for the group of patients in whom the dose of Enbrel was decreased from 50 mg twice weekly 
to 25 twice weekly, while the PASI 75 response rate increased between weeks 12 and 36 for patients 
who  remained  on  Enbrel  at  a  dose  of  25  mg  twice  weekly.  Despite  a  dose  reduction  from  50  mg  
twice weekly to 25 twice weekly at week 12, the significant proportion of patients (68%) in the group 
that were PASI 75 responders at week 12 remained as responders at Week 36. During the open-label 
treatment, the percent improvement from baseline PASI, Dermatologist Static Global Assessment and 
percent improvement from baseline in DLQI total score continued to increase for patients originally in 
the  placebo  and  the  25  mg  twice  weekly  treatment  groups.  For  the  patients  originally  in  the  50  mg 
twice  weekly  group,  the  percent  improvement  from  baseline  PASI  and  DLQI  total  score  were 
maintained when the dose  was  reduced  to 25  mg twice  weekly,  but the Dermatologist Static Global 
Assessment decreased upon dose reduction.

Discussion on Clinical Efficacy – Rheumatoid Arthritis 
The results of 5 controlled studies in adults with RA show efficacy of Enbrel at the proposed optimal 
dose of 25 mg twice weekly using predefined endpoints in RA patients.  The same dose administered 
once weekly gives a slower response and may be less effective.  
The dose of 25 mg twice weekly is further supported by PK/PD evidence from study 300-EU, which 
showed  optimal response  with  Enbrel  concentrations  in  the range  of  1000-2000  ng/ml;  serum  levels 
approximating  the  upper  range  of  the  target  concentration  were  achieved  in  a  higher  proportion  of 
patients receiving 25 mg Enbrel twice weekly.  
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  50  mg  Enbrel  (two  25mg  SC  injections)  administered  once  weekly  were 
evaluated  in  a  double  blind,  placebo-controlled  study  of  420  patients  with  active  RA.  In  this  study,  
53  patients  received  placebo,  214  patients  received  50  mg  Enbrel  once  weekly,  and  153  patients 
received  25  mg  Enbrel  twice  weekly.  The  safety  and  efficacy  profiles  of  the  two  Enbrel  treatment 
regimens were comparable in their effect on signs and symptoms of RA. 
Beneficial effects were seen after 1-2 weeks of treatment with Enbrel, and maximum effects appeared 
to be reached after 1-3 months.  Following discontinuation of Enbrel treatment, the therapeutic effect 
did not persist.  Long-term open-label studies of up to 2 years have shown sustained efficacy.  
Analysis shows that concomitant use of NSAIDs or corticosteroids did not influence the outcome of 
the trials.  
Combination  treatment  of  Enbrel  with  methotrexate  has  been  investigated  in  two  controlled  studies 
(studies 16.0014 and 308).  The efficacy results were positive. A double blind clinical trial comparing 
the  efficacy  of  Enbrel  alone  to  Methotrexate  in  patients  who  never  received  treatment  with 
Methotrexate  (Study  16.0012)  showed  a  decrease  in  radiographic  progression  (erosion  scores)  at  
12 and 24 month for patients receiving Enbrel 25 mg twice weekly. The Study 308 results shows that 
treatment of RA with the combination of etanercept (25 mg subcutaneously 2x weekly) and MTX (up 
to 20 mg orally 1x weekly) was superior in reducing disease activity, improving functional disability, 
and retarding radiographic progression compared with MTX or Enbrel alone.   
The  clinical  trials  also  provide  convincing  evidence  of  activity  against  Juvenile  Chronic  Arthritis  in 
the patient age-group of 4 – 17 years.  The posology proposed for this population is supported by the 
population pharmacokinetic study. 
The  characteristics  of  the  patients  chosen  seem  appropriate.    The  endpoints  used  are  correct  for  an 
anti-rheumatic drug with anti-inflammatory, pain relieving, and disease–controlling actions. 
Discussion on Clinical Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics in Plaque Psoriasis 
Pharmacokinetics: 
The most commonly prescribed systemic medications for psoriasis are MTX, cyclosporine, acitretin, 
and  8-methoxypsoralen.  Based  on  the  known  metabolism  and  elimination  pathways  of  these 
compounds  and  etanercept,  there  is  no  overlap  between  the  metabolism/elimination  pathway  for 
thus,  no 
etanercept  and 
pharmacokinetic interactions between etanercept and these medications are anticipated. 
for  MTX,  cyclosporine,  acitretin,  or  8-methoxypsoralen; 
those 
The  results  from  study  308,  which  evaluated  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  pharmacokinetics  of  the 
combination of etanercept and MTX in patients with RA, demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of 
etanercept  was  not  altered  by  the  concurrent  administration  of  MTX  in  patients  with  RA.  
Furthermore, 2 years of treatment with the combination of Enbrel and MTX has been shown to be well 
tolerated  in  patients  with  RA  and  did  not  result  in  unexpected  safety  findings.    It  is  expected  that  a 
similar safety profile for the combination of Enbrel and MTX would be seen in patients with psoriasis.

However, the following sentence was added to Section 4.4, Special warnings and special precautions 
for use, under “Combination therapy” of the proposed SPC: 
‘The use of Enbrel in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment of 
psoriasis has not been studied.’ 
Efficacy 
Indication 
The efficacy data are based on 1347 patients participating in 3 clinical trials. 
The  efficacy  of  Enbrel  versus  other  systemic  therapies  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis 
(responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing Enbrel 
with  other  systemic  therapies.    Instead,  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  Enbrel  were  assessed  in  three 
randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  all  three 
studies was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least 
a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks. 
The  CHMP  Considered (1) the attributes of the therapies currently used in the treatment of psoriasis, 
(2)  the  substantial  number  of  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  who  have  already 
failed  current  therapies  due  to  a  loss  of  efficacy  or  the  occurrence  of  toxicity,  and  (3)  the  lack  of 
clinical trial data directly comparing Enbrel to the currently available systemic agents, (4) the MAH 
proposal  for  a  second  line  indication  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in 
whom conventional systemic therapy or phototherapy has been inadequate or is inappropriate. 
However,  the  proposed  wording  would  allow  inclusion  of  patients  who  have  had  some,  albeit 
“inadequate”, response to previous therapy.  It is preferable that it should be reserved for patients who 
have  failed  to  respond.    Secondly, “inappropriate”  is  open  to  interpretation  without  defining  exactly 
what  is  meant  by  the  term.    It  would  be  better  to  specify  only  certain  conditions  such  as 
“contraindications” and “intolerance” to the other treatments. The CHMP proposed that the indication 
read   as follows: 
‘Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a 
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including cyclosporine, methotrexate or 
PUVA. see section 5.1’ 
Moreover, it is considered that failure to respond should be defined under Section 5.1 both in terms of 
measurable criteria as well as sufficient length of treatment and adequacy of dosing with the ‘failed’ 
treatment 
as follows: 
Enbrel is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1.  Patients who “failed to respond 
to” in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI<50 or PGA less than good), or 
worsening of the disease while  on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a sufficiently long 
duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as available. 
Population 
The primary efficacy endpoint in all 3 studies was the proportion of patients who achieved the PASI 
75  at  12  weeks.  Physician  and  patient  global  assessments  were  included  as  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints.  
All patients had moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and had received or had been a candidate 
to receive systemic psoriasis therapy (in the opinion of the investigator). Overall among all 3 studies, 
83%  of  patients  had  received  prior  systemic  therapy  or  phototherapy,  and  89%  of  patients  had 
received  prior  therapy  with  topical  steroids,  46%  with  UVB,  29%  with  PUVA,  14%  with 
cyclosporine, and 36% with methotrexate. 
A subgroup analysis of PASI 75 response at 12 weeks by prior systemic therapy was presented for all 
3 studies. There was little difference in PASI 75 response between patients who had received previous 
systemic therapy and those who had not.  
25/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For  study  20021642  the  MAH  presented  a  subgroup  analysis  of  PASI  75  response  at  12 weeks  by 
failure  of  previous  systemic  therapy  or  phototherapy.  The  group  that  had  failed  prior  therapies 
represented  337  patients  (65%  of  the  total  clinical  trial  population).  Based  on  the  results  from  this 
subgroup  analysis  for  study  20021642,  patients  who  failed  previous  systemic  or  phototherapy 
responded well to Enbrel.  
Dosage and duration of treatment 
The primary endpoint, PASI 75, was achieved in all Enbrel groups at 12 weeks. The response rate was 
dose  dependent;  50  mg  twice  weekly  dosage  regimen  was  the  most  effective  with  rapid  and  a 
significantly better response than the 25 mg twice weekly dose regimen. The results for the secondary 
endpoints  were  also  dose  dependent  with  50  mg  twice  weekly  dosage  regimen  being  the  most 
effective.  Enbrel  25  mg  once  weekly  was  less  effective  than  25  mg  twice  weekly  and  50  mg  twice 
weekly regimen. 
Although the 50 mg twice weekly dose does provide a more rapid response, it is not recommend  toe 
use of the 50 mg twice weekly dose for longer than 12 weeks because of the  limited safety data for 
longer durations of therapy.  Thus, the  Posology reads:  
‘The recommended dose of Enbrel is 25 mg administered twice weekly.  Alternatively, 50 mg given 
twice  weekly  may  be  used  for  up  to  12  weeks  followed,  if  necessary,  by  a  dose  of  25  mg  twice 
weekly.’ 
The long-term duration and schedule of treatment have not been evaluated . 
Maximum response was observed after initial treatment between Weeks 16 to Week 20; a statement 
advising to stop treatment at week 12 if no response has been observed should be included in the SPC. 
the  safety  and 
Duration 
Both phase 3 studies provide long-term efficacy and safety data from open active periods with up to 
72  weeks  of  Enbrel  treatment.    Additional  design  features  provide  robust  qualitative  data  that  are 
relevant to the long-term clinical use of Enbrel in psoriasis, namely: the safety of Enbrel withdrawal, 
and 
the  efficacy  of  reintroduction  of  Enbrel  following  discontinuation.  
Overall,  1126  patients  in  the  psoriasis  program  received  Enbrel  treatment  for  at  least  6 months,  
455 patients received Enbrel treatment for at least 1 year, and 289 patients received at least 48 weeks 
of  continuous  treatment.  The  available  safety  database  for  patients  with  psoriasis  complies  with  the 
ICH  guidance  for  exposure  to  assess  safety  (ICH  Topic  E1A,  Population  Exposure:  The  Extent  of 
Population  Exposure  to  Assess  Clinical  Safety,  CPMP/ICH/375/95)  and  demonstrates  an  acceptable 
safety  profile.    Moreover,  the  safety  profile  of  Enbrel  has  been  well  established  during  extensive 
clinical  studies  and  post  marketing  experience  in  patients  with  RA  and  other  rheumatic  diseases.  
In summary, the available clinical trial data support continuous use of Enbrel in psoriasis.  However 
the CHMP noted that there remains a paucity of evidence on duration of treatment and for long-term 
treatment  schedules.  In  the  absence  of  such  data,  only  weaker  evidence  on  response  rates 
(uncontrolled)  and  the  effect  of  withdrawal  can  be  considered.  There  is  some  evidence  that  patients 
with  partial  response  at  Week  12  will  continue  to  improve  given  continued  treatment  and  some 
evidence that responders continuing treatment will remain in remission (compared with the effect of 
withdrawing  treatment).    Clearly,  it  is  appropriate  to  cease  treatment  in  patients  with  inadequate 
response. 
 therefore.  The following sentence was added to Section .2, Posology and method of administration, 
of the proposed SPC: 
‘Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks.’ 
The CHMP considers that there is sufficient evidence of benefit in some patients between Weeks 12 
and 24 and that treatment duration should not be limited to 12 weeks based on efficacy considerations.  
However, there is inadequate evidence of efficacy beyond 24 weeks of treatment therefore this period 
of  treatment  should  not  be  exceeded.    If  re-treatment  is  warranted,  the  same  principle  should  be 
applied.  Other  current  systemic  therapies  recommend  intermittent  courses  of  treatment  to  induce 
remission. In addition, there is no evidence of a positive benefit/risk of continuous versus intermittent 
treatment with Enbrel. Therefore, the posology section recommend that treatment should be stopped 
26/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
when  remission  is  achieved.    The  CHMP  considered  that  the  risk/benefit  ratio  would  be    accurately 
reflected if the SPC Section 4.2 and 5.1 read as follows:   
Section 5.1 
‘Patients who ‘failed to respond to’ in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI 
<50 or PGA less than good), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately 
dosed for a sufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic 
therapies as available.’ 
Section 4.2. 
‘Plaque psoriasis 
The  recommended dose  of Enbrel is 25  mg  administered twice  weekly.  Alternatively, 50 mg  given 
twice  weekly  may  be  used  for  up  to  12  weeks  followed,  if  necessary,  by  a  dose  of  25  mg  twice 
weekly.  Treatment  with  Enbrel  should  continue  until  remission  is  achieved,  for  up  to  24  weeks.  
Treatment should be discontinued in patients who shown no response after 12 weeks.  
Retreatment 
Retreatment with Enbrel for 12 and 24 weeks (compared with 12 and 24 weeks of initial  treatment) 
resulted  in  PASI  75  response  rates  similar  to  the  initial  treatment  for  all  active  treatment  groups. 
However,  the  assessments  did  not  take  into  account  differences  in  pre-treatment  PASI  scores.  
Once the re-treatment baselines were considered, there was no clear evidence that PASI 75 responses 
were similar following re-treatment.  Moreover, the results were based on small numbers of selected 
patients. The Enbrel psoriasis clinical trial data, which demonstrates a lack of rebound on withdrawal 
and the ability to recapture efficacy with retreatment, is particularly relevant to intermittent or episodic 
treatment, and should be available in the SPC to guide clinicians. Ultimately, the specific duration of 
treatment, appropriate length of time between treatment courses if any, and the appropriate number of 
courses of treatment should be determined on an individual patient basis by the prescriber. The issue 
of whether retreatment with Enbrel resulted in a return of psoriasis control to levels at or near those 
achieved during initial treatment with Enbrel was addressed in a subset of patients who had responded 
(achieved  ≥ PASI  50  response)  to  Enbrel  treatment  during  the  initial  double-blind  period  of  study 
20021639.  The mean difference between the initial treatment and retreatment 12-week PASI score for 
the overall retreatment group is neither clinically nor statistically significant. 
The CHMP agrees that there is some evidence for the benefit of re-treatment.  However, as the safety 
profile in the RA trials is reassuring, it is considered that there are sufficient data to allow treatment or 
retreatment up to 24 weeks with 25 mg twice weekly. 
It  is  difficult  to  determine  what  is  the  optimal  period  without  treatment  before  re-treatment  is 
instituted,  or  the  number  of  iterative  courses.    Provided  it  is  accepted  that  the  risk/benefit  ratio  is 
favourable for the proposed indication, the SPC could allow re-treatment for further 24 week periods 
if/when  a  patient,  who  benefited  from  the  initial  treatment,  relapses,  and  the  cumulative  treatment 
period  does  not  exceed  what  has  been  shown  to  be  acceptable  in  the  RA  studies.  The  CHMP 
considered that the risk/benefit ratio would be accurately reflected if the SPC Section 4.2 reads: 
If re-treatment with Enbrel is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be followed.  
The dose should be 25mg twice weekly.  
Clinical Safety 
Presented below are the clinical trial data that supported the initial RA and JCA approvals, as well as 
data from safety updates from US and European trials, more recent clinical trials, and postmarketing 
safety reports. 
Patient exposure 
For the initial approval for RA and JCA, safety information was collected from 849 individuals treated 
with  Enbrel  and  154  individuals  who  received  placebo  in  double-blind  and  open-label  studies.   
Of the 849 individuals, 531 were patients with arthritis (477 with RA, 54 with JCA) exposed to Enbrel 
for  a  total  of  3,936  patient  months,  130  were  individuals  without  RA  (72  healthy  volunteers,  
27/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
45 patients with Crohn’s disease, 13 patients with HIV) and 188 individuals participated in 8 studies 
with  different  groups  (including  108  patients  in  a  sepsis  trial).    In  addition,  safety  updates  were 
submitted  which  included  1952  rheumatoid  arthritis  patients  (representing  5832  patient-years).   
The  safety  assessments  were  based  on  reports  of  study  events,  results  of  routine  physical 
determinations, and vital signs.  
Adverse events and serious adverse events/deaths 
Safety data from healthy volunteers were obtained from 5 studies.  No deaths and no serious adverse 
events occurred in those studies.  Other adverse events reported included injection site reactions, flu 
syndrome, headache, pharyngitis and rhinitis.  
Safety data from RA or JCA patients were obtained from double-blind and open label trials.  
The most common adverse events associated with Enbrel treatment were injection site reactions and 
infections.    They  occurred  in  42%  and  58%  of  Enbrel-treated  patients.    Other  adverse  event  were: 
headache (17 % of all Enbrel-treated patients), rhinitis (13 %), rash (13 %), nausea (12 %), abdominal 
pain  (9  %),  diarrhoea  (8  %),  cough  increased  (8  %),  asthenia  (7  %),  pain  (7  %),  dizziness  (7  %), 
accidental  injury  (7  %),  pharyngitis  (7  %),  vomiting  (6  %),  back  pain  (5  %),  hypertension  (5  %), 
peripheral  oedema  (5  %).    The  rates  obtained  for  the  pool  of  placebo-treated  patients  were  not 
significantly different, except for the injection site reactions.  
Injection site reactions occurred early in the course of treatment (often on the first or second injection) 
and  occurred  1  to  2  days  after  the  injection,  lasting  for  approximately  3  to  5  days.    Injection  site 
reactions were grade 1 or 2 in severity (erythema and/or pain, swelling or pruritus) and rarely resulted 
in discontinuation of the treatment.  
Rates  of  infections  (the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  event)  were  related  to  the  duration  of 
treatment.    Upper  respiratory  tract  infections  were  the  most  commonly  reported  type  of  infection. 
Increased  cough  and  respiratory  disorders  (“colds”)  were  found  to  be  significantly  more  frequent 
(p<0.05) in the high dose group compared to placebo and to the mid dose group.  A trend (p< 0.10) 
toward association of fever with Enbrel treatment overall and with high dose treatment as compared to 
placebo  was  noted.    The  majority  of  fevers  were  associated  with  infections  or  other  inflammatory 
conditions.  
In  the  sepsis  clinical  trial,  108  patients  with  documented  sepsis  were  treated  with  Enbrel  and  
33  patients  received  placebo.    In  this  study,  the  patient  group  was  severely  immuno-compromised.   
A  higher  mortality  was  observed  in  the  Enbrel-treated  than  in  the  placebo-treated  group  when  the 
infection was caused by gram-positive or unknown microbes, and the mortality rate was raised in the 
groups  treated  with  high  doses  of  Enbrel.    The  increased  mortality  observed  with  increasing  dose 
could not be explained by imbalances at enrolment. Mortality was not related to an identifiable direct 
toxicity of Enbrel.  
The  susceptibility  to  infection  is  increased  in  RA  patients  in  general,  due  to  a  suppressed  immune 
system  either  occurring  within 
induced  by  a  concurrent 
immunosuppressive  medication.    In  the  light  of  post-marketing  experience  (serious  infections  and 
sepsis, including fatalities) with Enbrel in the USA, the text of the SPC has been strengthened to alert 
the prescriber to the risk of the use of Enbrel in RA patients who are known to have an increased risk 
of  serious  infections  (e.g.,  those  with  advanced  or  poorly  controlled  diabetes  or  active  infections, 
including chronic and localised infections).

Safety-related withdrawals 
Of  531  RA  and  JCA  patients  treated  with  Enbrel,  5  %  (29  patients)  withdrew  for  safety-related 
reasons.  For  the  placebo  patients,  the  rate  was  5  %  as  well.    Thirteen  (13)  of  the  29  safety-related 
withdrawals were for events considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study drug. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In  the  RA  group,  8  %  of  Enbrel-treated  patients  and  6  %  in  the  placebo  and  placebo/methotrexate 
patients  had  a  serious  event.    Investigators  considered  that  47  of  49  events  in  the  Enbrel-treated 
28/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients were unrelated to the study drug. The two remaining serious events were hospitalisation for 
pancreatitis and hypotension.  
In  the  RA  groups,  7  patients  with  Enbrel  (out  of  531)  and  one  patient  with  placebo  (out  of  154) 
developed  cancer  while  on  study.    All  cancers  appeared  in  patients  treated  with  the  high  dose  of 
Enbrel. The company has indicated that there is no difference in the malignancy rates between Enbrel 
and placebo when corrected for the different duration of exposure to Enbrel (0.021 per patient-year) as 
compared  to  placebo  (0.022  per  patient-year).    To  date  no  increase  in  incidence  of  malignancy  has 
been seen with duration of treatment in the group treated with Enbrel.  The observed malignancy rate 
was similar to that expected for a matched general population. 
Safety updates  
The safety updates from the US and European studies, double-blind and open label, are based on 1952 
RA and JCA patients; 1566  patients treated for  at least 12  months, 1375  patients treated for  at least  
24 months, 1166 patients treated for at least 36 months, and 828 patients treated for at least 48 months.  
The safety profile that results from the increased exposure data appears to be similar to that observed 
in the initial safety assessment (on a total of 531 patients).  
Laboratory findings 
In the placebo-controlled studies that supported the initial RA and JCA approvals, the most commonly 
occurring  laboratory  abnormalities  were  low  lymphocytes  (62  %)  and  low  albumin.    Low  albumin 
occurred  in  43  %  of  Enbrel-treated  patients  compared  with  55  %  in  placebo  patients,  and  low 
haemoglobin was 20 % in the Enbrel group and 30 % in the placebo group.  Differences were seen in 
elderly Enbrel-treated patients with respect to renal function.  In the etanercept group, 13 % of elderly 
patients  had  high  serum  creatinine  levels  compared  to  none  in  the  18-49  year  and  2  %  in  the  
50-64 year age groups; these differences were considered to be normal signs of aging.  No worsening 
of  renal  function  was  seen  over  time.    Low  sodium  was  also  seen  more  frequently  in  the  elderly.  
There were no serious (Grade 3 or 4) abnormalities in serum creatinine or sodium among the Enbrel-
treated patients. 
A  separate  analysis  of  the  laboratory  toxicity  in  RA  group  treated  with  Enbrel  plus  methotrexate  as 
compared  to  placebo  and  methotrexate  did  not  find  extra  toxicity  in  the  Enbrel  plus  methotrexate 
group. 
Autoantibodies 
To  investigate  whether  autoantibodies  develop  in  Enbrel-treated  subjects,  the  incidence  and  titres  of 
antinuclear  antibodies  (ANA),  anti-ds  DNA  antibodies  and  anti-cardiolipin  antibodies  (ACLA)  were 
measured. Anti-ds DNA antibodies occurred in about 3 % (Crithidia assay), and ANA in about 11 % 
(either  IgG  or  IgM  isotype).    Placebo-treated  subjects  did  not  have  any  anti-dsDNA  antibodies.  
Approximately 5% of placebo-treated patients developed ANA.  With regard to ACLA, IgG or IgM 
antibodies were demonstrated in up to 10 % of the Enbrel-treated patients (not different from placebo). 
Antibody  levels  which  initially  increased,  usually  returned  to  normal  during  continued  Enbrel 
treatment.  No overt systemic lupus erythematosus was recorded.  
There was no consistent pattern in changes of titres of any of the analysed autoantibodies over time, 
and  eventual  shift  in  occurrence  or  titres  were  not  associated  with  adverse  events  related  to  the 
development of signs or symptoms of any other autoimmune disease during the observation time.

Immunogenicity of etanercept 
Several  assay  methods  have  been  developed.    The  most  recent  optimised  assay  indicated  that 
approximately 4 % (4 of 96) of patients treated with Enbrel 25 mg twice a week in a RA trial for up to 
3  months  were  antibody-positive  in  the  screening  assays  on  one  or  several  occasions.    They  were, 
however,  negative  in  the  assay  for  neutralising  antibodies.    No  dose  effect  was  observed  for  the 
development of anti-etanercept antibodies.   
No  relationship  could  be  established  between  the  occurrence  of  antibodies  to  etanercept  and  any 
adverse event or increase or decrease in the efficacy of the drug.  
Safety from other RA studies 
Study 160012 
In this pivotal study, more patients in the MTX group than in the etanercept 25mg group discontinued 
the  study  treatment  over  a  period  of  2  years  due  to  adverse  events.  MTX  and  etanercept  have  a 
different mechanism of action and therefore their safety profile may differ.  Overall, the incidence of 
adverse events was similar in all 3 treatment groups, and there were no significant differences in the 
rates of malignancy and infections between MTX and etanercept. 
Enbrel and Anakinra 
Patients  treated  with  Enbrel  and  anakinra  were  observed  to  have  a  higher  rate  of  serious  infection 
when compared with historical controls that were treated with Enbrel.  In addition, in a double-blind 
placebo-controlled  trial  in  patients  receiving  background  methotrexate,  patients  treated  with  Enbrel 
and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections and neutropenia than patients 
treated with Enbrel (see section 4.4).  
The  MAH  has submitted  data from  clinical trials (20000125 and  20000223) an updated draft  SmPC 
and Clinical Expert report and copies of the CIOMS forms relating to the reports of serious infections. 
The study 20000223 was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, and active-controlled study with a 
duration of 24 weeks.  RA patients on a stable MTX dose of 10-25 mg/week with active disease were 
randomised to one of 3 treatment arms: 
Group 1: Etanercept 25 mg twice weekly 
Group 2: Etanercept 25 mg once weekly + anakinra 100mg daily  
Group 3: Etanercept 25 mg twice weekly + anakinra 100 mg daily 
Therapy  was  initiated  in  242  patients,  with  80  patients  in  Group  1,  and  81  patients  each  in  Groups  
2 and 3.   
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  improvements  of  50% 
according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria at 24 weeks (ACR-50). 
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  improvements  of  20% 
(ACR-20) and 70% (ACR-70) at 12 weeks and 24 weeks. 
Efficacy results 
The efficacy results showed that there was no benefit in patients receiving combination treatment with 
Enbrel and anakinra when compared to patients receiving Enbrel alone. Comparisons of the ACR-50 
response at week 24 demonstrated no significant differences between the 3 treatment groups, the result 
were 41%, 39% and 31% in group 1,2 and 3 respectively. 
Safety results 
Overall, 204 of the 242 patients enrolled in the study completed the study. 75 in group 1, 63 in group  
2  and  66  in  Group  3.    The  differences  in  withdrawal  rates  in  the  combined-therapy  groups  were 
attributed to occurrence of adverse effects. A total of 13 subjects in the combination groups withdrew 
due to adverse events, compared to no subjects in the Enbrel alone group. Injection site reactions were 
reported  in  69%  of  patients  receiving  combination  therapy  compared  to  40%  in  the  Enbrel  alone

group. Other frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infections (15%) and 
nausea (10%). 
A total of 26 patients reported serious adverse events. The proportion of patients in the combination 
treatment groups who reported serious adverse events (21/162, 13%) was twice the number seen in the 
Enbrel alone group (5/80, 6%). The most commonly reported serious adverse event were injection site 
pain (3), pneumonia (3) and cellulitis (3).  These were reported in patients taking combination therapy. 
Serious infections 
          Serious  infections  were  experienced  by  9/162  (6%)  of  patients  receiving  combination  therapy.  
No  patients  in  the  Enbrel  alone  group  (Group  1)  experienced  any  serious  infections.  The  reported 
infections  were:  Pneumonia  (3),  Cellulitis  (3),  Herpes  zoster,  Pyelonephritis,  Pneumonitis  (1  each).  
In  2  cases,  one  of  cellulitis  and  one  of  pneumonitis,  the  investigator  considered  the  infection  to  be 
unrelated  to  the  study  drugs.  Of  the  3  patients  with  cellulitis,  one  had  diabetes  requiring  insulin 
therapy, one had an antecedent wound, and all three patients were also being treated with prednisone. 
Of  the  three  patients  with  pneumonia,  one  had  asthma  and  the  diagnosis  of  pneumonia  was  not 
supported by laboratory investigations in another patient 
          One  patient  had  a  fatal  outcome.  This  was  a  70  year  old  female  who  was  on  concomitant  treatment 
with MTX (15mg/week) and rofecoxib (25mg twice daily). The patient developed a wound infection 
after  seven  weeks  of  therapy.  She  was  subsequently  hospitalised  with  antibiotic  associated 
gastroenteritis.  The  patient  died  of  acute  respiratory  failure,  which  was  attributed  to  pulmonary 
fibrosis. 
Long term safety update - Protocol 16.0023 
Protocol  16.0012  was initially designed to compare  Enbrel with rapidly dose-escalated  methotrexate 
(MTX) in preventing joint erosions in subjects who had not previously received MTX.  Year 1 of the 
study  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  multicenter,  double-dummy,  active-control,  phase  3  trial 
comparing  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  Enbrel  monotherapy  (10  or  25  mg  twice  weekly)  with  rapidly 
dose-escalated oral MTX (median of 20 mg/wk after dose escalation).   
Protocol  016.0023  was  designed  to  provide  all  subjects  who  had  participated  in  Protocol  016.0012 
with  the  opportunity  to  receive  Enbrel  treatment  in  a  long-term  trial.      All  subjects  were  to  receive  
25 mg Enbrel administered twice weekly. 
The  primary  objectives  of  Protocol  016.0023  are  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  long-term  Enbrel 
administration  in  subjects  with  early  RA  on  safety,  health-related  quality  of  life  and  prevention  of 
disability,  structural  damage  as  measured  by  radiographic  progression,  and  clinical  activity 
(improvement and maintenance of improvement in signs and symptoms of disease). 
Study population 
The  safety  data  set  available  for  review  comprises  558  patients.    Forty-nine  patients  (8.8%)  have 
discontinued  the  study  prematurely.  The  study  treatments  can  broadly  be  divided  into  two  groups; 
patients treated with Enbrel alone (n=415); and patients treated with methotrexate and Enbrel (n=143). 
There are proportionately fewer males than females (25% and 75%, respectively) and white (86%) in 
the population studied.  The average age of patients was 50 years. 
Safety information 
The 5-year safety report includes safety data for all subjects who initially received Enbrel in Protocol 
016.0012  and  for  all  subjects  in  Protocol  0116.0023.    A  total  of  558  subjects  with  early  RA  are 
included in the database, representing 1921 subject years of Enbrel exposure. 
Deaths: Six deaths have been reported, compared to 17 deaths that would be predicted for the general 
population.  Mortality rates remained the same despite increasing exposure to Enbrel. 
31/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious Adverse Events: One hundred and seventy eight serious adverse events in 115 patients have 
been reported up to the point at  which the  database  was locked.   The rate  of serious  adverse events  
has been stable over time and is comparable to those seen in the MTX and Enbrel treatment groups of 
the  initial  controlled  trial.    Serious  adverse  events  were  observed  most  commonly  in  the 
cardiovascular, body as a whole, and respiratory systems.  Rates of serious adverse events in specific 
body systems calculated for the 3-year and 5-year reports were comparable. 
Withdrawals Due to Adverse Events: Of the 558 subjects treated with Enbrel, 49 subjects (8.8%) have 
withdrawn  either  due  to  death  (6  subjects)  or  other  adverse  events.    Twenty-four  subjects  withdrew 
from Protocol 016.0012 and 25 subjects from Protocol 016.0023.   
Infections:  Approximately  7%  of  subjects  have  experienced  serious  infections.  The  rate  of  serious 
infections is comparable to rates observed for the MTX and Enbrel treatment groups of the controlled 
trial and similar to rates observed for 2 other cohorts of patients with RA (from the Olmsted County, 
Minnesota database and the Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System database).  
Rates and types of serious infections have been stable over time. 
Malignancies:  Eighteen  cancers  have  been  observed  in  16  subjects.  The  rates  and  types  of 
malignancies  observed  are  in  the  range  expected  for  patients  with  RA,  and  exposure-adjusted  event 
rates are stable over time. 
Demyelination Events: No neurologic events associated with demyelination have been reported in this 
cohort of subjects with early RA. 
Cardiovascular  events:  One  of  the  6  deaths  observed  in  the  long-term  database  was  attributed  to  a 
cardiovascular  event.    One  subject  reported  exacerbation  of  heart  failure.    Unfortunately,  other 
contributing factors were not collected in this study, therefore, this observation in difficult to interpret. 
 To date, 2 events of new-onset heart failure have been reported for subjects in the long-term database 
(subjects  3114  and  6106  in  Protocol  016.0023),  which,  compared  to  the  predicted  rate  of  5.764 
expected for the general population, indicates no increased risk of new-onset heart failure. 
Conclusion 
The MAH has provided interim safety data from a long-term open-label study of the use of Enbrel in 
adults.  The data set presented comprises 558 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis aged more than 
18  years.  In  general,  patients  entering  an  open  label  study  are  a  selected  subgroup  of  those  initially 
randomized.  Further, the data are uncontrolled and the impact of patient withdrawals/lost-to-follow-
ups  and  missing  data  are  difficult  to  ascertain.    Therefore,  it  is  difficult  to  distinguish  the  effect  of 
treatment  from  the  underlying  course  of  the  disease/the  open  label  assessment  of  symptoms. 
Nevertheless,  it  appears  safety  data  are  consistent  with  continued  positive  risk/benefit  profile.  
The data presented do not give grounds for safety concerns.  
Safety in Special Populations 
JCA patients 
In study 16.0016 (children with Juvenile Chronic Arthritis), infections were reported in 43/69 (62 %, 
0.38 events per month) of patients (first part of the trial) and 15/25 (60 %, 0.33 events per month) of 
the  patients  on  Enbrel  (second  part  of  trial)  versus  8/26  (31  %,  0.28  events  per  month)  of  patients 
receiving placebo. Injection site reactions appear to be a consistent finding following treatment with 
Enbrel. 
Severe adverse events reports included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis which 
resolved  without  sequelae,  gastroenteritis,  depression/personality  disorder,  cutaneous  ulcer, 
oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic shock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and 
post-operative wound infection.  Several adverse events were reported more commonly in 69 juvenile

chronic arthritis patients receiving 3 months of Enbrel compared to the 349 adult rheumatoid arthritis 
patients: headache , nausea , abdominal pain , and vomiting). 
PsA patients 
The most common adverse events in the Enbrel group in study 16.0030 were injection site reactions 
(36%),  injection  site  ecchymosis  (12%),  accidental  injury  (8%),  headache  (8%),  and  rash  (5%).  
Except  for  injection  site  reaction  (36%  Enbrel  versus  9%  placebo),  no  adverse  event  occurred  in  a 
significantly  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  the  Enbrel  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group.   
All  occurrences  of  injection  site  reactions  were  of  mild  or  moderate  (grade  1  or  2)  intensity.   
Most  other  adverse  events  were  also  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity.    The  most  commonly  reported 
infections were upper respiratory infection (21%) and urinary tract infection and sinusitis (6% each).  
One (1) serious adverse events that was considered possibly related to Enbrel treatment was reported 
in this study.  One (1) patient treated with Enbrel was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS).  During 
a follow-up evaluation, the condition was diagnosed as monosymptomatic demyelinating disease. 
CHF patients 
Two  (2)  studies  were  conducted  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Enbrel  in  patients  with 
NYHA  Class  II–IV  CHF  (studies  200-EU  and  016.0021).  The  studies  were  terminated  after  an 
independent analysis of the 2 studies by a Data Safety Monitoring Board showed that it was unlikely 
that  a  benefit  would  be  seen  with  continued  Enbrel  treatment.  There  were  no  unexpected  safety 
findings in either of these studies, and adverse events included those previously reported in the CHF 
population  or  those  previously  associated  with  Enbrel  therapy.  Most  of  the  reported  adverse  events 
(infectious and noninfectious) were mild to moderate in intensity. 
Safety in Plaque Psoriasis  
Patient exposure 
The  overview  of  safety  is  a  review  of  information  collected  from  the  1347  patients  with  chronic 
plaque psoriasis enrolled in studies 20021632, 20021639, and 20021642. 
in 
in 
the  25 mg 
the  25  mg  QW  group,  415 
Of these 1347 patients, 414 were assigned to the placebo group and 933 were assigned to the Enbrel 
twice  weekly  group,  and  
groups  (160 
358  in  the  50  mg  twice  weekly  group).    Of  the  414  patients  in  the  placebo  group,  151 ultimately 
received  Enbrel  25  mg  twice  weekly  from  weeks  13  to  24  of  study  20021639  and  177  ultimately 
received Enbrel 25 mg twice weekly during the open-label extension period (weeks 13 to 48) of study 
20021642.  Therefore, across the 3 studies, 1261 patients received at least 1 dose of Enbrel for a total 
of  933  patient-years  of  exposure  to  any  dose  level  of  Enbrel.    Furthermore,  1204  patients  were 
exposed to Enbrel for at least 3 months, 1126 patients for at least 6 months, 831 patients for at least  
9  months,  455 patients  for  at  least  12  months,  and  95  patients  for  at  least  15  months;  this  includes  
289 patients who received Enbrel continuously for at least 48 consecutive weeks.   
Safety concerns surrounding the use of the anti-TNF class of agents include opportunistic infections or 
tuberculosis (TB), malignancies, haematologic reactions including pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, 
demyelinating  disorders,  worsening  of  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF),  and  autoantibody  formation.   
In relation to Enbrel use in psoriasis, each of these concerns will be addressed separately.  
Adverse events  
Enbrel was well tolerated in all 3 studies, with no dose-related adverse events experienced during the 
initial 12-week, placebo-controlled portion.  Additionally, most events, including infections, occurred 
in similar proportions of patients in each active group compared with the placebo group.   
The percentages of patients that reported at least one adverse event in studies 632, 639 and 642 were 
51% for the patients that received placebo, 47.5% for patients that received Enbrel 25 mg QW, 56% 
for patients receiving Enbrel 25 mg twice weekly and 45,5% for patients that received Enbrel 50 mg 
twice weekly.  
The only event that occurred in higher proportions of patients in the Enbrel groups than in the placebo 
group  was  injection  site  reactions  (ISRs),  which  occurred  in  6%  of  placebo  patients  compared  with 
33/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
11% of patients in the Enbrel 25-mg QW group, 14% in the 25-mg twice weekly group, and 16% in 
the 50-mg twice weekly group.  All ISRs were of mild to moderate intensity (grade 1 or 2).  Only 2 
patients (1 in the 50-mg twice weekly group and 1 in the 25-mg twice weekly group) withdrew from 
study 20021642, and 1 patient (25-mg QW group) withdrew from study 20021639 because of an ISR.   
Discontinuations for adverse events were similar across treatment groups during the initial 12-week, 
placebo-controlled portion. 
Enbrel continued to be well tolerated during the extended blinded portion (weeks 13 to 24) of studies 
20021632  and  20021639.    The  proportions  of  patients  who  reported  noninfectious  and  infectious 
adverse events decreased when compared with the initial 12-week period.  In addition, the incidence 
of ISRs decreased with longer exposure to Enbrel.  During the extended blinded portion (weeks 13 to 
24) of studies 20021632 and 20021639, ISRs occurred in a total of 5% of all patients:  6% of patients 
in the Enbrel 50-mg twice weekly group, 4% of patients in the 25-mg twice weekly group, 5% in the 
25-mg QW group, and 7% in patients in the original placebo group who began receiving Enbrel 25 mg 
twice weekly. 
Exposure-adjusted  rates  of  adverse  events  and  infections  during  the  withdrawal/  retreatment/  open-
label period of study 20021639 and the long-term, open-label period of study 20021642 were similar 
to those observed in the initial 12-week double-blind portion of the respective studies. 
Serious adverse events and deaths  
Serious  adverse  events  ()  occurred  in  similar  proportions  of  patients  across  treatment  groups  during 
the  initial  12-week,  placebo-controlled  portion  and  in  each  active  group  compared  with  the  placebo 
group.    During  the  extended  blinded  portion  (weeks  13  to  24)  of  studies  20021632  and  20021639, 
events continued to occur in similar proportions of patients across treatment groups and in each active 
group compared with the placebo group.  Furthermore, the serious adverse events reported during the 
double-blind treatment period are consistent with those already associated with Enbrel treatment. 
Exposure-adjusted rates of serious adverse events during the withdrawal/retreatment/open-label period 
of study 20021639 were similar to those observed in the initial 12-week, placebo-controlled portion of 
the study.  Additionally, exposure-adjusted rates of serious adverse events during the long-term, open-
label  period  of  study  20021642  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  initial  12-week,  placebo-
controlled portion of the study. 
Drug-related serious adverse events reported in studies 20021632, 20021639, and 20021642 included 
CNS  demyelinating  disease,  cystitis,  gastroenteritis,  lymphadenopathy,  lymphoma,  pancreatitis, 
papillary  thyrocarcinoma,  pneumothorax,  psoriatic  arthritis,  pulmonary  emboli,  and  worsening  of 
psoriasis.    Of  these  serious  adverse  events,  pneumothorax  is  being  added  to  the  section  of  “Serious 
adverse events reported in clinical trials” (section 4.8) because it was not previously listed in the SPC.  
Psoriatic arthritis and worsening of psoriasis are not being included in the SPC because the patients in 
the  studies  had  a  prior  history  of  these  conditions.    CNS  demyelinating  disease,  gastroenteritis, 
lymphadenopathy,  lymphoma,  pancreatitis,  and  pulmonary  emboli  already  appear  in  the  SPC.  
Papillary  thyrocarcinoma  is  not  being  added  because  the  risk  of  malignancies  is  already  adequately 
addressed  in  the SPC.   Cystitis  is  not  being added  because it resulted from  an elective  procedure  to 
correct a pre-existing anatomic abnormality. 
Serious Infections 
Serious  infections  were  rare  and  occurred  in  similar  proportions  of  patients  across  treatment  groups 
during  the  initial  12-week,  placebo-controlled  portion  of  the  3  studies.    Only  1  serious  infection 
(pneumonia) occurred during the extended blinded portion (weeks 13 to 24) of studies 20021632 and 
20021639. Five (5) serious infections occurred during the withdrawal/retreatment/open-label period of 
study  20021639  and  2  serious  infections  occurred  during  the  long-term,  open-label  period  of  study 
20021642  (see  table).  Overall  for  serious  infections,  there  were  6  cases  of  cellulitis,  3  cases  of 
pneumonia,  2  cases  of  abscess,  and  1  case  each  of  furunculosis,  pharyngitis,  cholecystitis, 
osteomyelitis,  and  gastroenteritis  reported.  No  reports  of  opportunistic  infections  or  tuberculosis 
occurred in any study.

EMEA 2004 
 
The following serious infections that were reported in Enbrel-treated psoriasis patients are being added 
to  the  section  of  “Infections”  within  the  SPC  (section  4.8):  abscess,  cellulitis,  cholecystitis, 
gastroenteritis, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia. 
Malignancies 
Across all 3 studies 25 malignancies were reported, 23 of which occurred in patients who had received 
Enbrel  reported  in  21 patients  who  had  received  Enbrel  the  two  remaining  neoplasms  occurred  in 
patients that received placebo. All of these malignancies occurred in the phase 3 studies; there were no 
malignancies reported in Enbrel-treated patients in study 20021632.   
The phase 3 studies included 1038.7 patient-years of observation.  For technical reasons, patient-years 
of exposure accrued in study 20021632 could not be combined with the phase 3 studies and thus are 
not  included  in  the  calculation  of  patient-years  of  observation  from  the  psoriasis  studies.   
The  tabulations  of  patient-years  of  observation  for  calculating  malignancy  rates  included  time  on 
Enbrel as well as time periods when patients were not receiving Enbrel but were still being observed 
(e.g., during study drug withdrawal period). 
Because there is an increased risk of cutaneous malignancy in patients with psoriasis, due in large part 
to  the  high  prevalence  of  exposure  to  ultraviolet  phototherapy  and  to  cyclosporin,  cutaneous  and 
extracutaneous malignancies are presented separately below. 
Overall,  10  patients  were  diagnosed  with  extracutaneous  malignancies  during  the  2  phase  3  studies.  
These  10 cases  of  extracutaneous  malignancies  included:    3  cases  of  prostate  carcinoma,  1  bladder 
carcinoma,  1 pancreatic carcinoma, 2 breast carcinoma, 1  papillary thyroid carcinoma,  1 lymphoma, 
and 1 oligo dendroglioma.  All 10 of these patients were receiving Enbrel at the time of diagnosis of 
the malignancy, most likely resulting from the fact that patients received Enbrel for the vast duration 
of the trials.  Except for the case of lymphoma and thyroid carcinoma, all cases were considered by the 
investigator to be unrelated to study drug.  
Regarding  cutaneous  tumours,  overall,  12  patients  were  diagnosed  with  cutaneous  malignancies 
during the 2 phase 3 studies, however, 1 of these patients had not received Enbrel prior to the time of 
diagnosis.  Therefore,  in  patients  who  had  received  Enbrel,  there  were  13  cases  of  cutaneous 
malignancies  in  11  patients:  8  cases  of  basal  cell  carcinoma  (1  patient  had  2 events  of  basal  cell 
carcinoma)  and  5  cases  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (1 patient  had  2 events  of  squamous  cell 
carcinoma).  
No cases of melanoma were reported.  One (1) case of in situ lentigo maligna (a premalignant lesion) 
was  reported  during  the  open-label  period  of  study  20021642,  the  patient  was  withdrawn  from  the 
study because of a biopsy diagnosis of in situ lentigo maligna in a preexisting pigmented skin lesion. 
Plausible explanations for the higher incidence of skin cancers in Enbrel-treated patients are: (1) the 
number  of  patients  and  the  duration  of  time  that  patients  received  Enbrel  vastly  exceeded  that  for 
placebo  due  to  the  designs  of  the  trials;  and  (2) the  potential  for  underlying  skin  cancers  to  be 
unmasked  as  the  patient’s  psoriatic  plaques  clear.    Six (6)  of  these  patients  with  cutaneous 
malignancies  had  a  previous  history  of  the  event,  and  8  had  received  prior  phototherapy  before 
entering  the  study.    Except  for  2  cases  of  basal  cell  carcinoma,  all  cases  were  considered  by  the 
investigator to be unrelated to study drug.   
Analysis of the risk attributable to Enbrel of relatively rare events like malignancy can be assessed by 
comparing the rates observed in the 2 phase 3 studies to those of an appropriate historical population.  
The  observed number  of  extracutaneous cancers  in  the Enbrel psoriasis  database  (10 extracutaneous 
malignancies/1038.7  patient-years =  1.0 per  100 patient-years) is not  significantly different from  the 
expected  rate  based  on  calculations  using  the  general  population  database  from  the  National  Cancer 
Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (0.5 per 100 patient-years; 
95%  confidence  interval  [CI]  =  0.2-1.1).    The  SEER  database  does  not  include  non-melanoma  skin 
cancers.  Several studies have confirmed that the risk of malignancy in psoriasis patients exceeds that 
in the normal population, and standardised incidence ratios of 1.78 (95% CI 1.32-2.40), 1.3 (95% CI 
1.2-1.4), 1.37 (95% CI 1.28-1.47), and 1.35 (95% CI 1.22-1.49) have been reported.

A  comparison  of  the  overall  malignancy  rates  calculated  for  patients  with  severe  (defined  as  any 
patient  who  was  receiving  systemic  therapy)  and  less  severe  psoriasis  with  those  observed  in  the 
Enbrel  studies  demonstrates  that  the  overall  rates  of  malignancy  in  the  2  phase  3  studies  are  very 
similar  to  those  observed  in  a  large  US  psoriasis  database  with  a  similar  psoriasis  disease  severity.  
The overall, observed rate of 2.2 events per 100-patient years (23 malignancies/1038.7 patient-years; 
95%  CI  1.4-3.3)  in  the  Enbrel  phase  3  studies  was  slightly  lower  than  the  95%  CI  for  the  severe 
psoriasis population (2.3-3.6) and slightly above the 95% CI for the less  severe psoriasis  population 
(1.8-2.1), as reported by Margolis. 
The numbers of squamous cell and basal cell skin carcinomas observed in the Enbrel phase 3 studies 
also were compared to 2 databases of the general population.  The expected numbers of squamous cell 
and basal cell skin carcinomas were calculated using data from the Southeastern Arizona Skin Cancer 
Registry;  and  the  expected  number  of  squamous  cell  carcinomas  also  were  calculated  using  the 
Rochester Epidemiology Project.  The observed rates of cutaneous malignancies in the Enbrel phase  
3 studies are comparable to those expected in these general population studies.  Each of the 3 observed 
rates in the Enbrel phase 3 studies are within the 95% CIs for the expected rates from these studies.  
Psoriasis  patients  have  an  increased  risk  of  cutaneous  malignancy,  due  in  large  part  to  the  high 
prevalence  of  exposure  to  ultraviolet  phototherapy  and  to  cyclosporin,  with  standardised  incidence 
ratios  of  2.46  (95%  CI  1.82-3.27)  4.15  (95%  CI  2.52-6.84),  2.5  (95%  CI  2.0-3.0),  and  3.2  (95%  CI 
2.3-4.4).  Taking this into consideration, the rates of cutaneous malignancies from Enbrel clinical trials 
are less than what would be expected in a population of moderate to severe psoriasis patients.  
Demyelinating Disorders 
There  have  been  rare  reports  of  demyelinating  disorders  in  Enbrel-treated  patients.    This  issue  was 
reviewed  by  the  CHMP  on  2  occasions,  and  the  labeling  was  revised  to  include  warning  language 
regarding demyelination. For the psoriasis studies, the entire integrated safety database was reviewed 
to  identify  any  verbatim  or  preferred  terms  that  might  have  suggested  any  new  occurrences  of 
demyelinating disorders.  One (1) case of demyelination was reported.  Approximately 6 weeks after 
starting  blinded  retreatment  with  25  mg  QW,  this  43-year  old  patient  experienced  symptoms  of 
neuropathy involving both upper extremities.  A magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a solitary 
lesion  in  the  right  parietal  periventricular  white  matter  that  was  considered  to  be  characteristic  of  a 
demyelination  plaque,  in  general,  and  multiple  sclerosis,  in  particular.    The  patient  was  withdrawn 
from  the  study  at  week  36  because  of  this  adverse  event  of  demyelinating  neuropathy.    Follow-up 
visits on prednisone treatment revealed marked clinical improvement. 
Haematology 
Rare  cases  of  pancytopenia  and  very  rare  cases  of  aplastic  anaemia,  some  with  fatal  outcome,  have 
been reported in patients treated with Enbrel. There were no cases of aplastic anaemia or pancytopenia 
reported in these studies 
Congestive Heart Failure 
There  have  been  post  marketing  reports  of  worsening  of  CHF,  with  and  without  identifiable 
precipitating  factors,  in  patients  taking  Enbrel.  Therefore  the  integrated  safety  database  from  the  
3 psoriasis studies was reviewed and it was confirmed that there were no cases reported. 
Anti-Etanercept Antibodies 
In  study  20021632,  no  patients  tested  positive  for  anti-etanercept  antibodies.    In  study  20021639,  
40 patients had 1 or more samples that tested positive for non-neutralising anti-etanercept antibodies.  
Retreatment in study 20021639 was not associated with an increase in antigenicity or the formation of 
neutralising  antibodies  to  etanercept.    In  study  20021642,  32  patients  had  1  or  more  samples  that 
tested positive for non-neutralising anti-etanercept antibodies.  
Six percent (72/1200) of patients tested positive for non-neutralising anti-etanercept antibodies during 
at least one time point during the studies.  Historically, antibodies to etanercept have been detected at 
least  once  over  multiple  testing  points  in  approximately  3%  to  5%  of  patients  with  RA.    As  in  the 
studies  of  rheumatic  conditions,  the  presence  of  anti-etanercept  antibodies  in  these  patients  had  no 
demonstrable effects on the safety or efficacy of etanercept in any of the psoriasis studies.

EMEA 2004 
 
Deaths  
There were a total of 4 deaths in all of the studies.  None were drug related.  
Laboratory findings  
Most laboratory values were normal. Of the laboratory abnormalities that did occur, most were mild or 
moderate (grade 1 or grade 2) and were balanced across treatment groups.   
No grade 3 or grade 4 abnormalities were reported in study 20021632, and no grade 4 abnormalities 
were  reported  in  any  of  the  studies  in  the  psoriasis  program.  There  were  2  grade  3  laboratory 
abnormalities reported  during the double-blind  period  of study  20021642: 1 occurrence of increased 
alanine transaminase (ALT) in a patient in the etanercept 50 mg twice weekly group, who had a later 
diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, and 1 occurrence of grade 3 increased haemoglobin in a patient in the 
placebo group. 
During the study drug withdrawal, retreatment, open-label after retreatment, and open-label periods of 
study 20021639, 8 patients reported 9 grade 3 abnormal liver function results.  Five (5) patients had 
transient elevations of liver function test with laboratory values returning to normal during continuous 
therapy; 1 of these patients experienced non-infectious hepatitis secondary to simvastatin.  The other 3 
elevations  occurred  in  3  patients:  1  with  an  infectious  gastroenteritis  1  day  prior  to  the  elevation,  1 
with a positive hepatitis C serology, and 1 with an abnormal baseline value. One (1) patient withdrew 
from  study  20021642  during  the  long-term,  open-label  period  because  of  grade  2  elevated  liver 
enzymes associated with an adverse event of jaundice. 
Discussion on Clinical Safety - Rheumatoid Arthritis 
There are no significant differences in frequency of adverse events (other than injection site reactions) 
recorded either between the groups treated with different dosages of Enbrel or between Enbrel and the 
placebo-treated groups.  However, the incidence of most of adverse events described is slightly higher 
for Enbrel at the proposed dose than for placebo. 
In the clinical trials that supported the initial RA and JCA approvals, local injection site reactions were 
reported frequently (42 %), but rarely led to a withdrawal of Enbrel.   
Concerns also remain that patients receiving long-term treatment with Enbrel might develop an as yet 
unidentified  immune  defect,  rendering  them  at  increased  risk  of  malignancy  and  of  overwhelming 
sepsis. Long-term inhibition of TNF-alpha could lead to a serious impairment of defence mechanisms 
against infections (especially opportunistic infections) and against the development of neoplasms.  
Additional warnings are included in the SPC on the increased  susceptibility to  infections in patients 
who are at risk of developing infections.  These warnings were included as a result of post-marketing 
experience in the USA where serious infections and sepsis, including fatalities, have been reported in 
patients with or at risk of infection who had received Enbrel.  
There  is  no  difference  in  the  malignancy  rates  between  Enbrel  and  placebo  when  corrected  for  the 
different  duration  of  exposure.    To  date  no  increase  in  incidence  of  malignancy  has  been  seen  with 
duration of treatment in the group treated with Enbrel. 
The  detection  of  anti-etanercept  antibodies  was  also  a  concern.    None  of  the  etanercept  antibodies 
were  neutralising  antibodies.    It  seems  that  anti-etanercept  antibodies  may  be  a  transitory 
phenomenon.    No  dose  effect  was  observed  for  the  development  of  anti-etanercept  antibodies.   
No  relationship  could  be  established  between  the  occurrence  of  antibodies  to  etanercept  and  any 
adverse event or increase or decrease in the efficacy of the drug.  
Post-authorisation experience 
By September 2000, 10 cases of serious blood dyscrasias, some with a fatal outcome, in patients with 
rheumatoid  arthritis  treated  with  etanercept  have  been  reported.  These  10  reports  of  serious  blood 
37/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
dyscrasias,  from  worldwide  post  marketing  experience,  include  3  cases  of  aplastic  anaemia  and  
7 cases of pancytopenia. Five (5) of these 10 cases had a fatal outcome due to sepsis. In the majority 
of these cases, there was a close temporal relationship between the start of treatment with etanercept 
and the occurrence of haematological disorders (range 2 weeks to 5 months). Recent or concomitant 
exposure  to  other  anti-rheumatic  medicines  known  or  suspected  to  have  myelosuppressant  effects, 
such  as  methotrexate,  leflunomide,  6-mercaptopurine,  cyclophosphamide  and  azathioprine  was 
reported in some patients who subsequently developed pancytopenia; some patients had no clear past 
history  of  haematological  abnormalities.  As  an  urgent  measure,  the  prescribing  and  patient 
information has been modified through a rapid procedure at the request of the marketing authorisation 
holder.  
Following  the  availability  of  data  from  additional  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing  experience,  the 
following undesirable effects were added to the product labeling: Infections (including fatal infections 
and sepsis), blood dyscrasias (including sometimes  fatal aplastic anemia and pancytopenia), nervous 
system  disorders  (seizures  and  demyelinating  conditions),  malignancies  (affecting  various  sites), 
aggravation  of  heart  failure,  autoimmune  events  (development  of  autoantibodies  and  lupus-like 
syndrome),drug  interaction  with  anakinra  (resulting  in  increased  risk  of  serious  infections  and 
neutropenia), bronchospasm, urticaria, rash, several types of injection site reactions, tuberculosis and 
cutaneous vasculitis 
Following  the  availability  of  data  from  additional  clinical  trials  the  following  adverse  events  were 
added to the product labeling: 
Among rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients in 
placebo-controlled, active-controlled, and open-label trials of Enbrel, serious adverse events reported 
included malignancies (see below), asthma, infections, heart failure, myocardial infarction, myocardial 
ischaemia,  chest  pain,  syncope,  cerebral  ischaemia,  hypertension,  hypotension,  cholecystitis, 
pancreatitis,  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage,  bursitis,  confusion,  depression,  dyspnoea,  abnormal 
thrombosis,  pulmonary  embolism, 
healing,  renal 
membranous  glomerulonephropathy,  polymyositis,  thrombophlebitis,  liver  damage,  leucopenia, 
paresis, paresthesia, vertigo, allergic alveolitis, angioedema, scleritis, bone fracture, lymphadenopathy, 
ulcerative colitis and intestinal obstruction  
insufficiency,  kidney  calculus,  deep  vein 
Malignancies 
Thirty-eight  new  malignancies of  various  types were  observed in 2,680  rheumatoid  arthritis patients 
treated in clinical trials with Enbrel for up to 48 months, including 231 patients treated with Enbrel in 
combination  with  methotrexate  in  the  1-year  active-controlled  study.  The  observed  rates  and 
incidences  in  these  clinical  trials  were  similar  to  those  expected  for  the  population  studied.  
No  psoriatic  arthritis  patients  developed  malignancies  in  the  double-blind  placebo-controlled  studies 
of up to  6 months duration involving  131 Enbrel-treated patients.   Twenty-three malignancies were 
reported in plaque psoriasis patients treated with Enbrel in double-blind and open-label studies of up 
to 15 months involving 1,261 Enbrel-treated patients. 
Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been 
received in the post marketing period). 
Discussion on Clinical Safety - Psoriasis 
Injection Site Reactions 
The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  were  injection  site  reactions.  The  incidence  of  ISRs 
decreased with longer exposure to Enbrel. 
Infections 
There  were  no  reports  of  opportunistic  infections  or  tuberculosis.  During  the  first  12  weeks  of 
treatment  there  were  12  serious  infections  (cellulitis-7,  pneumonia,  furunculosis,  pharyngitis, 
cholecystitis,  and  gastroenteritis).  Exposure-adjusted  rates  of  infections  during  the  withdrawal/re-
treatment/open-label  periods  were  similar  to  those  observed  during  the  first  12  week  double  blind 
periods. 
38/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-cutaneous malignancies 
All malignancies except of lymphoma and thyroid carcinoma (both cases in the 50 mg twice weekly 
group) were considered by the investigators to be unrelated to the study treatment. 
The rate of non-cutaneous cancers in the submitted studies (1 per 100 patient-years) was higher than 
the  expected  rate  from  the  National  Cancer  Institute  (0.5  per  100  patient-years).  Published  data 
suggest  that  the  risk  of  malignancy  in  patients  with  psoriasis  is  higher  than  in  normal  population 
(standardised incidence ratios of 1.3-1.78). 
Cutaneous malignancies 
The overall observed rate of 1.3 cases per 100 patient-years in the submitted data is comparable to the 
Southeastern Arizona Skin Cancer Registry. However, the ratios for squamous cell skin cancers were 
higher  in  the  studied  population  (0.5  per  100  patient-years)  than  in  the  two  databases:  Southeastern 
Arizona Skin Cancer (0.3) and Rochester Epidemiology Project (0.1). 
An  increased  incidence  in  cutaneous  cancers  in  patients  with  psoriasis  can  be  due  to  the  effects  of 
phototherapy, local skin treatments or systemic therapy. However, it can not be ruled out that a higher 
incidence of squamous cell carcinoma is not treatment related. 
Autoantibodies 
Six  percent  of  patients  with  psoriasis  had  non-neutralising  antibodies  against  etanercept  during  the 
study  treatment.    This  compares  to  3%  to  5%  of  RA  patients  testing  positive  for  anti-etanercept 
antibodies.  There was no correlation between the presence of antibodies and efficacy/safety data.

Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Quality 
The application  was supported by a comprehensive pharmaceutical dossier.  The two specific issues 
requiring  attention  were  viral  safety  and  active  substance/finished  product  specifications,  including 
analytical methods validation.  
Answers  to  these  points  were  provided  as  answer  to  the  list  of  questions.  Follow-up  measures  / 
commitments are proposed by the company to answer, to an agreed timeframe, the outstanding points 
identified in the response assessment report.  
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence of etanercept acting as an 
antagonist of TNF  biological  activity.   The pharmacokinetics were studied in mice, rats, rabbits and 
monkeys.    Due  to  the  formation  of  anti-etanercept  antibodies  in  rodents,  the  pivotal  toxicity  studies 
were performed in cynomolgus monkeys.  Etanercept was well tolerated in monkeys following twice 
weekly  s.c.  administration  at  dose  levels  up  to  15  mg/kg  for  up  to  26  weeks.    There  were  no 
toxicological significant treatment related adverse events.  
In development toxicity studies in rat and rabbits, etanercept did not elicit maternal toxicity, embryo-
fetal  toxicity,  teratogenicity  or  peri-or  post-natal  toxicity  (rats).  Etanercept  was  not  genotoxic.   
The lack of carcinogenicity studies was a concern for the CHMP, but the CHMP concluded that there 
are probably no meaningful animal studies which can further evaluate the theoretical risk of increased 
malignancies resulting from chronic TNF inactivation; therefore the company will conduct long-term 
surveillance for tumours in man.  
Efficacy 
The activity of Enbrel has been demonstrated on disease activity measures.  The results of 5 controlled 
studies  support  the  recommendation  of  25  mg  Enbrel  twice  weekly  in  the  indication  for  RA 
(recommended dose for optimal therapeutic effect).  
Enbrel  has  been  shown  to  slow  progression  of  disease-associated  structural  damage  as  measured  by 
X-ray  in  adult  RA  patients  not  previously  treated  with  methotrexate.    Enbrel  was  also  shown  to  be 
effective treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous 
DMARD therapy has been inadequate. 
39/42 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beneficial effects were seen after 1-2 weeks of treatment with Enbrel, and maximum effect appeared 
to  be  reached  after  1-3  months.    Patients  have  reached  the  48  months  time  point  without  loss  of 
efficacy. 
Information has also been submitted on the use of Enbrel in Juvenile Chronic Arthritis.  The clinical 
trials  provide  convincing  evidence  of  activity  of  Enbrel  in  JCA  in  patient  age  group  of  4-17  years.  
The posology proposed appears to be appropriate. 
No  formal  drug  interaction  studies  were  conducted.  It  was  found  that  co-administration  of 
methotrexate did not alter the pharmacokinetics of Enbrel. There is no scientific nor pharmacological 
reason that commonly prescribed medications used in the treatment of RA should interact with Enbrel.  
Safety 
The  safety  profile  shows  a  reasonable  tolerance  for  Enbrel.  The  most  common  adverse  events 
associated with Enbrel treatment were injection site reactions and infections.  When the incidence of 
infections  was  related  to  the  time  on  drug,  this  was  not  statistically  significantly  different  from 
placebo.  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection  was  the  most  commonly  reported  type  of  infection.  
Additional warnings are included in the SPC on the increased  susceptibility to  infections in patients 
who are at risk of developing infections.  These warnings were included as a result of post-marketing 
experience in the USA where serious infections and sepsis, including fatalities, have been reported in 
patients with or at risk of  infections. 
Adverse  events  that  may  be  encountered  in  the  indication  Juvenile  Chronic  Arthritis  are  adequately 
described in the SPC. 
Antibodies to etanercept were detected in approximately 4 % of patients.  They were, however, non-
neutralising  antibodies.    No  relationship  could  be  established  between  the  occurrence  of  antibodies 
and any adverse event or the efficacy of the drug.  
There was no difference in the malignancy rates between Enbrel and placebo when corrected for the 
different  duration  of  exposure  to  Enbrel.    To  date,  no  increase  in  incidence  of  malignancy has  been 
seen  with  the  duration  of  treatment  or  in  relation  to  predicted  malignancy  rates  for  the  general 
population. 
Based  on  post  marketing  experience,  the  product  information  has  been  modified  to  include  cases  of 
serious  blood  dyscrasia  ,  autoimmune  phenomena,  allergic  reactions,  demyelinating  disorders  and 
worsening of congestive heart failure. 
Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been 
received in the postmarketing period. 
Concurrent administration of Enbrel and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of serious 
infections and neutropenia. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use 
is not recommended. 
Benefit/Risk Assessment 
It is the CHMP’s view that the quality of the product, including viral safety, has been demonstrated to 
be satisfactory.  
The CHMP judged the preclinical data on the product to be satisfactory.

Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Regarding the clinical efficacy and safety data for rheumatoid arthritis, the CHMP discussed several 
points of concern:  
- 
Updated  safety  information  provided  by  the  applicant,  with  particular  attention  to  a  possible 
increased risk of sepsis;  
The question whether or not to limit the indication to the treatment of active RA in adults when 
the  response  to  all  usual  disease  modifying  antirheumatic  drugs,  including  MTX,  has  proved 
inadequate;  
The question whether or not, given the safety concerns, the treatment should start with 10 mg 
twice weekly, 25 mg twice weekly being mentioned as the optimal dose; 
The  post-approval  comparative  studies  of  Enbrel  against  other  anti-rheumatic  treatments  as 
single agents; 
The proposed follow-up studies and further epidemiological surveillance studies for sepsis and 
malignancies.

The CHMP recognised that there might be an increased risk of sepsis and serious infection, but judged 
that  the  warnings  in  the  SPC  and  PL  were  sufficient  to  alert  the  prescriber.  The  CHMP  did  not 
consider it appropriate to restrict the use of Enbrel to patients in whom the response to all DMARDs 
had  proved  inadequate.  A  drafting  group  was  convened,  who  proposed  to  the  CHMP  the  following 
wording  :  “...when  the  response  to  disease  modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs,  including  methotrexate 
(unless contraindicated), has been inadequate.” Regarding the dose, it was agreed by the CHMP that 
the starting dose for use in adults should be 25 mg twice weekly, but that 25 mg once weekly can also 
be considered (although this  gives a slower response and  may be less effective). The CHMP agreed 
with the post marketing studies proposed by the company. 
The CHMP also required the applicant to include the indication for Juvenile Chronic Arthritis in the 
initial  authorisation,  as  it  was  felt  there  was  a  clinical  need  in  this  patient  population  for  this  new 
treatment  option.  In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  accepted  that  Enbrel  in  monotherapy  is  effective  in 
rheumatoid arthritis patients when the response to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, including 
methotrexate  (unless  contraindicated)  has  been  inadequate.    Its  activity  has  been  shown  on  disease 
activity  measures  but  no  results  on  structural  damage  have  been  presented.    The  CHMP  agreed  an 
extension  in  the  treatment  of  active  severe  rheumatoid  arthritis  in  adults  not  previously  treated  with 
methotrexate.  The CHMP also accepted the following indications: treatment of active polyarticular-
course juvenile chronic arthritis in children aged 4 to 17 years who have had an inadequate response 
to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate, and treatment of active and progressive psoriatic 
arthritis  in  adults  when  the  response  to  the  disease-modifying  antirheumatic  drugs  therapy  has  been 
inadequate.  
Infections  including  tuberculosis  remain  a  major  safety  issue  associated  with  anti-TNF  therapy.  
Following  review  of  post  marketing  reports,  the  company  has  strengthened  the  warnings  and 
precautions  in  the  Enbrel  product  information  to  reflect  both  clinical  trials  and  post  marketing 
experience:  Cases  of  serious  blood  dyscrasia,  autoimmune  phenomena,  allergic  reaction, 
demyelinating disorders, and worsening of congestive heart failure were added to the safety sections 
of the product information. Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and 
lymphoma) have also been received in the post-marketing period). 
Plaque Psoriasis 
The Evidence of efficacy compared with placebo has been clearly established and replicated. The data 
support the inclusion of  both  25mg twice weekly and 50mg twice weekly (for  up  to  12  weeks) in the 
posology,  though  there  was  evidence  of  superior  short-term  efficacy  for  the  higher  dose.    There  is 
some evidence to support re-treatment once a responder has relapsed. 
Evidence that some patients might benefit from treatment durations longer than 24 weeks is weak and 
the  optimal  duration  of  treatment  has  not  been  defined.    Maintenance  of  effect  and  prevention  of 
relapse  have  not  been  fully  investigated.  The  long-term  dosing  schedules  have  not  been  fully 
evaluated.

Overall, the safety profile in patients with psoriasis did not differ from the safety in other populations 
of  patients.  The  only  exception  was  an  incidence  of  cutaneous  cancers,  especially  squamous  cell 
carcinoma,  which  was  higher  in  psoriasis  patients  treated  with  Enbrel.  Incidence  of    injection  site 
reactions    was  dose-dependent  during  the  first  12  weeks  of  treatment.  Enbrel  clearly  demonstrated 
short-term  efficacy  in  patients  with  psoriasis;  the  safety  profile  was  acceptable  up  to  24  weeks  of 
treatment.    However,  long-term  risks  relative  to  the  established  systemic  therapies  are  unknown. 
Enbrel  should  therefore  be  reserved  for  patients  with  psoriasis  unresponsive  or  intolerant  to  other 
systemic therapy. As described in section 5.1. 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
benefit/risk profile of Enbrel was favourable in the following indications:  
Enbrel can be used alone or in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of active rheumatoid 
arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate 
(unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. 
Enbrel is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults 
not previously treated with methotrexate. 
In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Enbrel used alone or in combination with methotrexate has been 
shown to slow the progression of disease-associated structural damage as measured by X-ray. 
Treatment of active polyarticular-course juvenile chronic arthritis in children aged 4 to 17 years who 
have had an inadequate response to, or who have  proved intolerant of,  methotrexate. Enbrel has not 
been studied in children aged less than 4 years. 
Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-
modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. 
Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to 
conventional therapy. 
Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a 
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including cyclosporine, methotrexate or 
PUVA.

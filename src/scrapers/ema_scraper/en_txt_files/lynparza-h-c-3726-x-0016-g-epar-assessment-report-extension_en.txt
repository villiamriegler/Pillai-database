2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The capsule formulation of olaparib was approved on 16 December 2014 by the European Commission for 
the following indication: “Lynparza is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic) high-grade serous 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or 
partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy”. Platinum-sensitive is defined as disease progressing 
at least 6 months after completion of the penultimate platinum chemotherapy.This procedure concerns an 
extension application to add a new pharmaceutical form (film-coated tablets) associated with new 
strengths (100mg and 150mg). 
The tablet formulation was developed to provide advantages over the capsule formulation in terms of 
bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, strength, pharmaceutical form and consequently potentially higher 
patient adherence to treatment (reduction from 16 capsules per day to 4 tablets per day). 
In addition, the MAH applied for the following indication for the tablet formulation:  
Olaparib is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who 
are in response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The MAH also applied for amendments to the product information for the capsule formulation to ensure 
consistency between the product information of the two formulations. The previously approved indication 
for the capsule formulation was not amended. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The requested indication concerns patients who are platinum sensitive, without restriction to the BRCA 
mutated status. The proposed indication also mentions ‘high grade’ cancer regardless of histological type 
and thus including high grade serous, high grade endometrioid and other types of ovarian, fallopian tube, 
or primary peritoneal cancer.  
Data to support this application derive from two pivotal studies, the Phase III randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicentre study, SOLO2 (conducted with olaparib tablet formulation), and the 
Phase II randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, Study 19 (conducted with 
olaparib capsule formulation). 
Both SOLO2 and Study 19 included ovarian cancer patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed disease who 
were in response (complete [CR] or partial [PR]) to their final platinum regimen and who had received at 
least two previous lines of platinum-based therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers in Europe and remains difficult 
to diagnose at an early curable stage. The disease presents an important public health issue in Europe. In 
2012, ovarian cancer was estimated to be the fifth most common cause of cancer death (297,600 deaths) 
and the fifth most common newly diagnosed cancer (441,500 new cases) in the European Union (EU)-27

(Ferlay et al 2013). A total of 75% of patients present with advanced disease (Stage III or IV) (Hennessy 
et al 2009). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Epithelial ovarian cancer comprises the majority of malignant ovarian neoplasm (about 90%) (Chan JK et 
al 2006; Jelovac D et al. 2011). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of surface epithelial 
ovarian tumours includes six major histotypes - serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, transitional 
cell and epithelial-stromal. The serous subtype of ovarian carcinoma accounts for approximately 60-80% 
of ovarian cancer cases and is the most aggressive type of ovarian cancer.  
Grade is an additional prognostic determinant and a number of grading systems currently exist which are 
derived from reviewing the following tumour characteristics: architectural features, mitotic counts and 
nuclear atypia (ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines). Low grade (grade 1, well differentiated) serous 
ovarian carcinoma is considered a distinct type of disease compared with high grade (grade 2 and 3 – 
moderately and poorly differentiated) serous carcinoma based on a number of clinical and molecular 
features, thus forming a 2 tier classification of low and high grade disease widely accepted and used in 
clinical practice (Levanon et al 2008; Vang et al 2009). 
Despite the high sensitivity of ovarian cancer to initial treatment with platinum and taxane combination 
chemotherapy (following cytoreductive surgery), which is the standard of care in the front-line setting, 
the majority of women diagnosed with advanced-stage disease will have a recurrence of their cancer.  
Recurrent disease is classified as platinum resistant or platinum sensitive, depending on whether the 
disease recurred less than or greater than 6 months following previous platinum therapy, and this 
classification is highly prognostic and is important in determining optimal chemotherapeutic treatment 
options. 
Three subgroups of patients with relapsed ovarian cancer have been identified: 
- patients with platinum-refractory disease who progress during platinum treatment, 
- patients with platinum-resistant disease who develop recurrence <6 months from the completion of 
platinum chemotherapy, 
- patients with platinum-sensitive disease: partially platinum-sensitive and platinum-sensitive recurrence 
are currently considered as separate sub-groups and are respectively defined by a relapse-free period of 
6 to 12 months and >12 months following a response to the final dose of prior platinum treatment (NICE, 
technology Appraisal 91 May 2005; ESMO guidelines, Ledermann et al, 2013). 
Platinum predominantly causes large-scale DNA intra-strand cross-links which require a competent 
homologous recombination pathway for effective repair. Given that platinum sensitivity and PARP 
inhibitor sensitivity may converge at the homologous recombination pathway, it was possible that 
platinum responsiveness may be also enrich for PARP inhibitor sensitivity [Mukhopadhyay et al 2010].  
Clinical data support the hypothesis that platinum sensitive tumours are more sensitive to PARP inhibitors 
than platinum resistant tumours [Matulonis et al 2016]. Thus, while BRCA mutations and HRD might 
represent biological markers of sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, platinum responsiveness may be a clinical 
indicator of sensitivity to these compounds. 
New emerging data suggest that PARP inhibitor sensitivity is broader than BRCA1/2  and HRR deficiencies 
and may extend to non-HRR DNA damage response deficiencies and pathways as well [Postel-Vinay et al 
2013, Cerrato et al, 2016, Murata et al, 2016, Lu et al 2017]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a 
variation  
EMA/819800/2017 
Page 13/163 
 
 
 
 
 
51% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer have compromised homologous recombination-based repair 
(Cooke et al. 2011).  
It is assumed that somatic BRCA and homologous repair deficiency (HRD) status refer to samples at time 
of diagnosis/primary surgery. Advanced tumours are normally heterogeneous and may be so also for 
somatic BRCA mutations/HRD. The selective pressure of platinum therapy is at least partly reflected in 
time to recurrence so that late recurrences may increase the likelihood of positive findings with respect to 
sBRCA/HRD. In addition reversion of gBRCA mutations is a well described mechanism associated with 
resistance development.  
While Type I tumours are characterized by specific mutations in KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PTEN and PIK3CA 
but rarely TP53 and are relatively genetically stable, Type II tumours are characterised by nearly 
universal TP53, which makes them genetically highly unstable (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 
2011).  Moreover, recent evidence suggests that serous and endometrioid carcinomas arise from the 
tubal fimbrae, suggesting similar biology and origin for the high grade epithelial histologies (Jayson et al 
2014). Pennington et al reported in their study that contrary to the common belief of homologous 
recombination deficiencies being characteristic of high-grade serous ovarian cancer only, DNA repair 
deficiencies were found equally commonly in carcinomas with non-serous histology (Pennington et al 
2014). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Early stage ovarian cancer is often asymptomatic and therefore difficult to detect. For women who do 
experience symptoms in the early stages, ovarian cancer is sometimes misdiagnosed because the 
majority of symptoms are nonspecific. These symptoms may overlap those of gastrointestinal and other 
diseases, and as a result, many patients may be treated incorrectly for months or years.  
The definitive diagnosis and staging of ovarian cancer is by surgery, and cytological or histological 
examination of tissue samples.  
The Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) surgical staging system is used for epithelial ovarian 
cancer and primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma. Because the disease tends to be asymptomatic in early 
stages, or associated with vague, non-specific symptoms, the majority of patients are diagnosed with 
advanced stage disease.  
The advanced stage at which ovarian cancer is generally detected is reflected in the 5-year survival rates; 
46% across all stages and 29% for advanced stages (Siegel et al 2017). Even though, over 80% of 
patients respond to initial platinum-based chemotherapy treatment, the majority subsequently relapse 
(Colombo et al 2010). Recurrent disease is incurable, and the challenge is to balance aggressive 
treatment in an effort to prolong disease-free time, while maintaining a tolerable side-effect profile and 
quality of life (Lancet 2009). Most patients will die within 3 to 4 years of diagnosis [Coleman et al 2013]. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Platinum-sensitive recurrence is defined clinically by a response to platinum-based therapy and a 
relapse-free period of ≥ 6 months after the final dose of prior platinum treatment (Colombo et al 2010; 
Pfisterer and Ledermann 2006). There are three primary treatment options for platinum-sensitive 
recurrent ovarian cancer patients who are in response (complete response or partial response) to 
platinum-based chemotherapy: observation (also referred to as surveillance), bevacizumab monotherapy 
maintenance after bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for platinum-sensitive recurrent

disease, or maintenance therapy following response to platinum-based chemotherapy followed by PARPi 
maintenance therapy. Olaparib capsules is currently approved in this setting in adult patients with 
platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal 
cancer with a BRCA mutation (either germline or tumor) who are in response (complete response or 
partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy, while niraparib is approved in the same setting but 
irrespective of the BRCA mutation status. 
About the product 
Olaparib is a potent inhibitor of human poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase enzymes (PARP-1, PARP-2, and 
PARP-3), and has been shown to inhibit the growth of selected tumour cell lines in vitro and tumour 
growth in vivo either as a standalone treatment or in combination with established chemotherapies.  
PARP are required for the efficient repair of DNA single strand breaks and an important aspect of 
PARP-induced repair requires that after chromatin modification, PARP auto-modifies itself and dissociates 
from the DNA to facilitate access for base excision repair (BER) enzymes. When olaparib is bound to the 
active site of DNA-associated PARP it prevents the dissociation of PARP and traps it on the DNA, thus 
blocking repair. In replicating cells this also leads to the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 
when replication forks meet the PARP-DNA adducts. In normal cells, homologous recombination repair 
(HRR) pathway is effective at repairing these DNA DSBs. In cancers that lack functional components of 
HRR such as BRCA1 or 2, DNA DSBs cannot be repaired accurately or effectively. Instead, alternative and 
error-prone pathways are activated, such as the classical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, 
leading to increased genomic instability. After a number of rounds of replication, genomic instability can 
reach insupportable levels and result in cancer cell death, as cancer cells already have a high DNA damage 
load relative to normal cells. In the absence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, HRR pathway may be 
compromised by other mechanisms, although the causative aberrancy and penetrance are not fully 
elucidated. Absence of fully functional HRR pathway is one of the key determinants of platinum sensitivity 
in ovarian and other cancers. 
In BRCA-deficient in vivo models, olaparib given after platinum treatment resulted in a delay in tumour 
progression and an increase in overall survival compared to platinum treatment alone that correlated with 
the period of olaparib maintenance treatment. 
The capsule formulation of olaparib was approved on 16 December 2014 by the European Commission for 
the following indication: “Olaparib is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with platinum sensitive relapsed BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic) high grade serous 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or 
partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Platinum sensitive is defined as disease progressing at least 6 months after completion of the penultimate 
platinum chemotherapy.” 
For the tablet formulation, the MAH applied for the following indication, which was agreed by CHMP:  
Olaparib is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who 
are in response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Treatment with olaparib should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products.

The drug product is supplied as 50 mg hard capsules and as 100 mg and 150 mg tablets for oral use. 
The tablets and capsules are not to be substituted on a milligram-to-milligram basis due to differences in 
the dosing and bioavailability of each formulation. Therefore, the specific dosage recommendations for 
each formulation should be followed: 
•  Capsule formulation 
Patients must have confirmation of a breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation (either germline 
or tumour) before olaparib treatment is initiated. BRCA mutation status should be determined by an 
experienced laboratory using a validated test method. 
Genetic counselling for patients with BRCA mutations should be performed according to local regulations. 
The recommended dose is 400 mg (eight 50 mg capsules) taken twice daily, equivalent to a total daily 
dose of 800 mg. 
Patients should start treatment with olaparib no later than 8 weeks after completion of their final dose of 
the platinum containing regimen. It is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the 
underlying disease.  
The tablet formulation was developed to provide advantages over the capsule formulation in terms of 
bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, strength, pharmaceutical form and consequently potentially higher 
patient adherence to treatment (reduction from 16 capsules per day to 4 tablets per day). 
• 
Tablet formulation 
The recommended dose of Lynparza is 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) taken twice daily, equivalent to a 
total daily dose of 600 mg. The 100 mg tablet is available for dose reduction. 
Patients should start treatment with Lynparza no later than 8 weeks after completion of their final dose of 
the platinum containing regimen.  
It is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease. There are no 
data on retreatment with Lynparza following subsequent relapse.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This application is a line extension to the existing marketing authorisations for Lynparza hard capsule 50 
mg (EMEA/H/C/3726). Assessment of the active substance focused only on the main changes and 
reference to the already approved procedure was made in sections that are identical or essentially similar. 
The finished product is presented as film coated tablets containing 100 mg or 150 mg of olaparib as the 
active substance.  
Other ingredients in the tablet core are: copovidone, colloidal anhydrous silica, mannitol and sodium 
stearyl fumarate. Excipients in the coating are: hypromellose, Macrogol 400, titanium dioxide (E171), 
iron oxide yellow (E172) and iron oxide black (E172) (150 mg tablets only), as described in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC.  
The product is available in Alu/Alu non-perforated blister, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The manufacturing process of olaparib for the tablet product is very similar to the current process used for 
capsule product starting from the same regulatory starting materials and using the same raw materials at 
each step (reagents, solvents and catalyst) within the same process parameters ranges.  
The main differences between both processes are in the purification/seeding step and the removal of the 
micronisation step. Some further minor adjustments have been satisfactorily justified and can be 
accepted. The introduced changes are considered acceptable since the polymorphic form and particle size 
distribution of the active substance are not considered critical quality attributes for the tablet formulation 
since the active substance undergoes a hot melt extrusion process and is rendered amorphous during the 
finished product manufacturing process.  
The current specifications for olaparib active substance are appropriate for the manufacture of the 
tablets. Olaparib for tablet formulation is routinely tested for appearance, identification by IR or NMR 
spectrometry, assay by LC, organic impurities by LC, residual solvents by NMR spectrometry or GC, water 
content by KF and sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.). Compared to the original capsule application, analytical 
methods and their validation remain unchanged except for the identification tests. Impurities detected in 
olaparib development batches remain unchanged, however given the reduction of the maximum daily 
dose (from 800 mg to 600 mg), the limits for specified impurities  have been slightly increased in line with 
the ICH Q3A qualification threshold. The analytical methods for olaparib active substance have already 
been previously validated according to ICH Q2 (R1) requirements and assessed in the capsule application.  
The packaging material for the active substance remains the same as the original submission i.e. double 
low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, within a rigid outer container/drum, which complies with EC 
regulation 10/2011 (as amended by EC regulation 1183/2012). 
Stability data from three production scale batches stored in the proposed packaging under long term 
conditions for up to 36 months (25 °C / 60% RH) and under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) for 
6 months according to the ICH guidelines was provided.

The parameters assessed during stability studies are appearance, assay by HPLC, related substances by 
HPLC, water content by KF, polymorphic form by NIR method and particle size distribution by laser 
diffraction method. The specification limits and analytical procedures for parameters tested during 
stability are identical to those employed during release testing except for polymorphism and particle size 
distribution which are tested only for information. Details on laser diffraction method and NIR method 
have been provided along with validation data. The 36 month data show no significant change with 
regards to the description, assay, organic impurities, polymorphic form, water content or particles size 
distribution for the samples stored at 25 °C/60% RH, nor after 6 months at 40 °C/75% RH and 6 months 
at 50 °C/ambient humidity. 
In addition, stability data under stress conditions under light has been provided. No significant change 
was observed for description, assay, organic impurities, polymorphic form or water content for the 
sample stored under ICH light conditions. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed retest period of 48 months for olaparib when stored in 
LDPE bags at or below 30°C was considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Olaparib film-coated tablets are intended for immediate release and are available in two strengths: 100 
mg which is yellow to dark yellow film-coated tablets, oval, bi-convex, 14.5 x 7.25 mm, debossed with 
“OP100” on one side and plain on the reverse, and 150 mg is green-grey film-coated tablets, oval, 
bi-convex, 14.5 x 7.25 mm, debossed with “OP150” on one side and plain on the other side. The two 
dosage strengths are differentiated by colour and engraving. 
Olaparib film-coated tablets are composed of milled olaparib extrudate blended with post-extrusion 
excipients. The final tablet strength is obtained using different compression weight of a common blend. 
Olaparib is already authorised as a 50 mg capsule. However, since the posology of the capsule product is 
not ideal (8 size 0 capsules taken twice daily) in terms of convenience for the patient, an improved 
product is desirable to reduce the burden of a large number of dosage units for administration. The 
pharmaceutical form is adapted to the target population (adults) and to the posology: two 150mg tablets 
taken twice daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 600 mg. The 100mg tablet is available for dose 
reduction. Both the 100 and 150 mg tablet strengths used the green film-coat during the early and pivotal 
clinical trials. The quality target product profile (QTPP) has been defined as shown in Table 1: 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a 
variation  
EMA/819800/2017 
Page 19/163 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1. Quality target product profile (QTPP) of Lynparza 100 mg and 150 mg film-coated tablets. 
Attempts to develop a standard disintegrating tablet using crystalline olaparib were unsuccessful due to 
solubility-limited release from this type of dosage form, even when using micronised crystalline olaparib. 
Evaluation of alternative technologies was undertaken to deliver an acceptable oral solid dosage form that 
was capable of delivering a 300 to 400 mg dose in two dosage units per administration, enabling the 
maximum predicted daily clinical dose of up to 800 mg to be delivered in as few as four dosage units. 
The results of the investigation with several different enhanced formulations demonstrate that the 
amorphous solid dispersions of olaparib by melt extrusion have significantly enhanced bioavailability over 
the other formulation types (i.e. using lauryl macrogol glycerides (LMG) capsule formulation. 
Since olaparib has low solubility in aqueous media (≤0.1 mg/mL), the development of dosage forms has 
been directed towards solubility enhancing technologies. The capsule formulation was developed as a 
semi-solid surfactant-based formulation (LMG capsule formulation), which was demonstrated to enhance 
the solubility of the active substance in simple aqueous media. However this formulation was limited by 
low bioavailability. 
Therefore a different approach has been taken for the tablet formulation. This was based on generating an 
amorphous solid dispersion of olaparib stabilised in a polymer carrier matrix, which allows an increase in 
the active substance loading possible in a single dosage unit, thus reducing the number of units required 
to deliver the required dose. Due to the solubility enhancement achieved with the amorphous solid 
dispersion, the bioavailability is also increased, leading to a lower required dose for the tablet compared 
to the capsule formulation. 
The formulation development was realized in two stages: first to define the composition of the amorphous 
solid dispersion (extrudate), and then to determine the composition of the final compression blend. 
Numerous extrudate formulations of olaparib containing different matrix polymers, surfactants and drug 
loadings were assessed against the following criteria: formation of degradation products of olaparib, drug

variation

release profile. The data generated for this study led to definition of the optimal matrix polymer carrier. 
The impact of storage on product performance was then assessed. It was concluded that olaparib 
extrudate at relatively high drug loading in the lead formulation can be stored and that moisture does not 
impact physical stability, unless high temperatures and high relative humidity are encountered. The use 
of appropriate packaging materials for long-term storage mitigates the risk of exposure to such 
conditions.  
During the hot melt extrusion process used to manufacture the tablet product, olaparib is converted to the 
amorphous form. The solubility of the amorphous form is significantly higher than that of the crystalline 
form, as it has been shown by the solubility data. Caco-2 permeability investigations have shown olaparib 
to be moderately permeable. Based on its solubility and permeability data olaparib drug substance is a 
BCS Class IV. 
Small amounts of residual crystalline content have the potential to seed further recrystallization on 
storage. In order to further understand this risk and to evaluate the suitability of the formulation 
developed, a study was performed to assess the potential for the presence of residual crystalline content, 
in both extrudate and tablets, to seed additional crystalline material during the proposed shelf life of the 
product. Data presented showed no significant change in the crystalline content and no significant change 
in dissolution performance. This data demonstrates that the propensity for recrystallization in extrudate 
and tablets is very low, even when the initial residual crystalline content is high (a scenario which is 
excluded by the control strategy). 
Potential direct compression tablet formulations were explored with dissolution properties evaluated as 
the decision criteria. Numerous different variants were processed (varying % extrudate, nature and % 
filler, nature and % lubricant, nature and % disintegrant).  
Based on assessment of the dissolution, a post-extrusion tablet formulation with a good compressibility 
and with high extrudate loading has been defined. The dissolution performance of this variant gave the 
highest mean dissolution. In order to confirm that the in vivo performance of the chosen tablet gave an 
acceptable bioavailability increase, this formulation was dosed at 100 mg in a fasted beagle dog 
pharmacokinetic study. The data derived from this study were compared against the previously 
generated LMG capsule data and demonstrated that the melt extruded tablet prototype formulation 
delivered a significant enhancement in the bioavailability in dog compared to the clinically dosed LMG 
capsule. 
For the tablet coating a standard non-functional film coat was selected based on known, standard 
commercially available hypromellose-based composition types. The tablet prototype formulation 
composition was subsequently developed into a range of tablet strengths for clinical use. 
All excipients of the formulation are standard functional materials used in pharmaceutical direct 
compression tabletting processes and comply with Ph. Eur. or other relevant standards (e.g., food 
additives Regulation). Olaparib has been tested for compatibility with excipients in the formulation and no 
incompatibilities have been found. The largest single excipient by weight is the polymeric carrier for the 
extrudate. The use of matrix polymer is well established as a standard functional material in melt 
extrusion processes. The well-established function of this material enable melt extrusion processing and 
provide a medium in which olaparib is able to remain amorphous during storage and dissolution. The 
polymer is hygroscopic:  in contact with humid air it can absorb water which has the potential to impair 
the physical stability. Therefore olaparib film-coated tablets and extrudate intermediate are stored in 
appropriately protective packs.

The development of the dissolution method has been described in sufficient detail taking into 
consideration the physicochemical properties of the active substance. The discriminatory power of the 
method has been investigated. Results obtained suggest that changes to the manufacturing process have 
little to no impact on product release characteristics both in vitro and in vivo. Overall the demonstration 
of discrimination power of the QC dissolution method is considered satisfactory. 
Olaparib tablets do not disintegrate. The tablet erodes as the active substance and soluble excipients 
dissolve at the interface between tablet surface and the dissolution medium. As expected for a rapid 
erosion-based dissolution mechanism, the larger, higher strength, 150 mg tablet demonstrates a slightly 
slower rate of dissolution than the lower 100 mg strength tablet. As a consequence the dissolution 
specifications have been set accordingly. 
Holding time studies were successfully finalized for for extrudate intermediate and based on the stability 
results a holding time of 12 months was established. Specifications for extrudate intermediate have been 
suitably justified. Olaparib extrudate intermediate is stored in a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bag, 
within a rigid outer container/drum. It is stated that the primary packaging component is a food grade 
LDPE bag in compliance with EC regulation 10/2011 (as amended by EC regulation 1183/2012). A holding 
time of 24 months for bulk tablets has been also established and is supported by stability data on one 
batch of each strength.  
Bulk olaparib film-coated tablets are packed in a sealed aluminium foil bag. The tablets may also be stored 
in a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bag within the sealed aluminium foil bag. The bulk bag is stored 
within a rigid outer container/drum which provides physical protection. The polyethylene bags are food 
grade and comply with the Ph. Eur requirements.  
Lynparza finished product 100 mg and 150 mg film-coated tablets are packaged in Alu/Alu 
non-perforated push-through type blister pack made from a base web of aluminium laminate, PVC, 
polyamide and sealed to a hard temper aluminium foil coated with heat seal lacquer. The packaging 
material in direct contact with the product complies with current legislation (EC 10/2011).  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The main steps of the olaparib 100 and 150 mg film-coated tablets manufacturing process are: mixing, 
hot melt extrusion, milling, compression, film coating and packing processes.] 
The in-process controls (IPCs) during the manufacturing process have been presented and are 
adequately justified. The control strategy ensures that the manufacturing process consistently delivers a 
product that meets the defined criteria for all release specifications.  
The manufacturing process for olaparib extrudate and the film-coated tablets has been validated on three 
commercial batches from each strength. Process validation data complies with set acceptance criteria. 
In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is sufficiently robust to provide 
assurance that film-coated tablets of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification, are 
produced. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for 
description (visual), identification of olaparib (LC-UV), assay (LC), degradation products of olaparib (LC), 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a

dissolution of olaparib (LC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF)  and microbiological 
quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used in the routine analysis of finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from a large number (>140) of production scale batches, most of which have been 
entirely manufactured at the proposed site for commercial supply have been presented. All data is within 
specification except for description. The results show that the finished product can be manufactured with 
consistent quality and meeting its specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Three batches of each strength of Lynparza film-coated tablets (100 and 150 mg), manufactured at 
commercial scale in the commercial manufacturing facility, have been placed on stability under long-term 
(25 °C/60% RH), intermediate (30 °C/75% RH), accelerated (40 °C/75% RH), and 50°C/ambient 
according to the ICH guidelines. Results are available after 24 months of storage at 25 °C/60% RH and 30 
°C/75% RH, 6 months of storage at 40 °C/75% RH and 3 months at 50°C. The stability batches are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, water content, dissolution, hardness 
and microbiological quality. The methods used for assay and degradation products were stability 
indicating. The specification limits and analytical procedures for parameters tested during stability are 
identical to those employed during release testing .  
The results of stability batches show little change over time and a good physical and chemical stability at 
all conditions tested. The only trend at 50°C/ambient RH is a very slight increase in total degradation 
products observed for the 100 mg tablets. 
A photostability study was carried out according to ICH Q1B Guideline. The result of the photostability 
testing indicates that olaparib film-coated tablets (100 and 150 mg) present little or no change for the 
tested parameters (description, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content and hardness).  
Forced degradation / stress studies were carried out on 100 and 150 mg olaparib film-coated tablets and 
excipient blends. Samples were subjected to stress conditions comprising thermal degradation, acid/base 
hydrolysis, oxidation and light. For each of these conditions low level degradation was observed and 
which indicates that olaparib film-coated tablets are extremely stable. 
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 36 months stored in the original package 
in order to protect from moisture and without any special temperature storage condition, as stated in the 
SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the materials used in the manufacture of olaparib tablets are derived from human or animal 
sources.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of 
the active substance and finished product manufacturing processes. However, no design spaces were 
claimed for the manufacturing process of the active substance nor for the finished product. The results of 
tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and 
these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance 
in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
New non-clinical data were submitted to support this application, including two new toxicology studies, a 
non-GLP compliant 1 month repeat dose toxicity study in rats, and a GLP-compliant 3 months repeat-dose 
toxicity study also in rats, performed in compliance with GLP. Focus is hereby made on the data provided, 
not previously assessed as part of the initial MAA.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
New pharmacology data were provided as part of this application  
•  Activity of PARP inhibitors AZD2281 (olaparib) and AZD2461 against PARP-3: 
AZD2461 is a potent inhibitor of PARP-1 and PARP-2, developed as a follow-up to olaparib (AZD2281) that 
represented a poorer substrate for P-glycoprotein than olaparib. Published data (Rulten et al., 2011) 
demonstrated a role for PARP-3 in Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) DNA double strand break (DSB) 
repair. As part of the characterization of AZD2461, PARP-3 activity was determined for both AZD2281 
(olaparib) and AZD2461. These studies have demonstrated that while olaparib effectively inhibits PARP-3, 
AZD2461 does not. Together, the data demonstrating that AZD2461 is not an effective inhibitor of PARP-3 
and NHEJ, while maintaining anti-tumour activity in BRCAm tumour models (Jaspers et al., 2013),

suggest that PARP-3 is not required for the synthetic lethality and anti-tumour activity of olaparib in BRCA 
deficient tumours. 
•  PK, PD and efficacy study using Different Olaparib Doses in the TNBC PDX in vivo 
model HBCx-10 
To build a preclinical PKPD/efficacy relationship model, an olaparib sensitive PDX model (HBCx-10) has 
been used. This model is derived from a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient, carries a 
homozygous BRCA2 mutation and has been shown to respond to single agent olaparib given orally, once 
per day at 100 mg/kg. This model is also very sensitive to platinum treatment. A number of different 
continuous doses were tested in the HBCx-10 PDX model ranging from 2.5 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg. There 
was an initial period of tumour growth for both 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg treatments prior to tumour 
regression. This was consistent with the known mechanism of action for olaparib where cell death results 
from insupportable genomic instability that follows replication in a situation where both PARP-1 is 
inhibited and homologous recombination repair is deficient due to BRCA2 mutation (Farmer et al, 2005). 
For the 50 mg/kg dose treatment, the time taken to induce tumour regression was extended (from ~17 
to ~28 days) compared to the 100 mg/ kg dose. In addition, the average Day 30 tumour volume for the 
50mg/kg dose was 8.6% of the starting volume vs 1.4% with the 100 mg/kg dose. For doses below 50 
mg/kg, no tumour regression was seen by Day 30. 
Both tumour pharmacodynamics (PAR inhibition) and plasma pharmacokinetics were determined 1 hour 
after dosing on Days 7 and 14 of continuous dosing for both vehicle control and olaparib treated tumours. 
There was a clear correlation between dose of olaparib, free levels of olaparib in the plasma and the level 
of PAR inhibition in the tumour. Together, this information has been used to determine the predicted time 
above both the tumour PAR IC50 and IC90 for each of the doses tested and is shown in the table below.

•  Activity of olaparib metabolites in terms of PAR inhibition and anti-proliferation in 
sensitive cell line models 
Three olaparib metabolites (M15, M12 and M18) that each constitute approximately 10% of the total 
circulating drug-related material were tested for target (PAR) inhibition and antiproliferative potency 
against the BRCA mutant breast cancer cell line MDA-MB436 using clonogenic assays. 
Olaparib was a more potent inhibitor of PARP-1 PARylation than the three olaparib metabolites, M15, M12 
and M18 as determined by PAR ELISA with olaparib being approximately 7-fold more potent that M18 and 
20-fold more potent than M12 and M15. 
Olaparib was also more potent at inhibiting the growth of BRCA1 mutant cells (MDA-MB- 436) than the 
three olaparib metabolites, with approximately 4-fold greater potency than M18 and 30-fold greater 
potency than M12 and M15 and therefore are not considered to contribute significantly to efficacy.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No additional pharmacokinetic drug interactions and pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The full nonclinical safety profile of olaparib was previously assessed at time of the initial marketing 
authorisation application.

Single dose toxicity 
No additional single dose toxicity studies were conducted. Previous studies showed that the highest 
non-lethal oral dose in rats was 240 mg/kg and that the highest non-lethal IV dose in mice and rats was 
70 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In the pivotal repeat dose rat studies reported in the original MAA, olaparib was formulated in DMSO 
diluted 1:10 with 10% hydroxylpropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβC) in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). In an 
attempt to explore higher dose levels for possible future carcinogenicity studies, two dose setting studies 
of 1 and 3 months duration in Han Wistar rats were conducted since the original MAA submission. A 
suspension formulation of milled olaparib in 0.5% hydroxylpropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and 0.1% 
Tween 80 was used in these dose setting studies. 
Whilst not required to support this current advanced cancer indication, these studies were submitted by 
the MAH as the administered doses and exposures in these studies were higher than those achieved on 
the pivotal rat repeat dose studies.

These studies are summarized in Table 1. 
•  1 Month Oral (Gavage) Toxicity Study in the Rat (8000589) 
The objectives of this study were to determine the potential toxicity and toxicokinetic characteristics of 
AZD2281 (olaparib), when given by daily oral gavage for 1 month to rats, and to provide data to set a 
suitable high dose level for use in a subsequent 3 month oral toxicity study in rats. 
Groups of 10 male and 10 female Wistar Hannover rats were dosed once daily with olaparib at dose levels 
of 0, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day (males) or 0, 25, 50, 100 and 250 mg/kg/day (females) for one 
month. This study used suspensions of milled drug substance in 0.5% HPMC and 0.1% Tween 80. 
After a single dose, exposure to olaparib increased in a less than proportional manner between the low 
and high doses, a trend more marked in males than females. Following repeat dosing, there was a trend 
to a decrease in exposure in males. In females, systemic exposure to olaparib was comparable with 
repeat dosing. Where both sexes received the same dose level, exposure was greater in females than in 
males. A summary of the TK data is provided in Table 2.

Oral administration of olaparib at dose levels of up to 1000 mg/kg/day in males and 250 mg/kg/day in 
females was tolerated, with no compound-related deaths, but was associated with clinical signs in females 
at > 100 mg/kg/day, and reduced bodyweight gain, food consumption and decreased plasma alkaline 
phosphatase and/or triglycerides in both sexes at all dose levels. Haematological changes, including 
decreases in red blood cell parameters (red blood cell count, haemoglobin and haematocrit), leukocyte 
counts (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), reticulocytes and/or increases in 
platelets, were seen for males at ≥ 500 mg/kg/day and for females at ≥ 25 mg/kg/day. 
Treatment-related histopathological findings were seen in the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, mesenteric 
lymph node and caecum. Decreased hematopoietic cellularity in the bone marrow and atrophy of the red 
pulp in the spleen was seen in males dosed at 1000 mg/kg/day and in females at > 100 mg/kg/day. 
Lymphoid depletion was seen in the thymus of males dosed at > 250 mg/kg/day and in females at > 50 
mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of sinusal histiocytosis in the mesenteric lymph node in 
males at > 100 mg/kg/day and in females at 250 mg/kg/day. Epithelial erosion (characterised by a 
thinned, basophilic surface epithelium with occasional single epithelial cell necrosis, and with regenerative 
glandular epithelial hyperplasia and mucosal infiltrates of mixed inflammatory cells) was noted in the 
caecum in some males at > 100 mg/kg/day but was not present in females at any dose level. 
The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in this study was considered to be 500 mg/kg/day for males 
and 50 mg/kg/day for females. 
•  3 Month Oral (Gavage) Toxicity Study in the Rat (526803) 
The objective of this study was to determine the potential toxicity of AZD2281 (olaparib) when given by 
oral gavage once daily for 3 months to rats. The dose response for toxicity was explored and a 
no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was determined. Plasma samples were analysed in order to 
assess exposure to the test compound and to verify absence of test compound in control animals. 
Groups of 10 male and 10 female Wistar Hannover rats were dosed once daily with olaparib at dose levels 
of 0, 100, 250 and 1000 mg/kg/day (males) or 0, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day (females) for at least 91 
days. This study used suspensions of milled drug substance in 0.5% HPMC and 0.1% Tween 80. 
Systemic exposure to olaparib was demonstrated at all dose levels. In males systemic exposure to 
olaparib increased generally dose-proportionally between the low and mid doses and less than 
proportionally between mid and high doses. In females, Cmax increased in a generally dose-proportional 
manner between the low and mid doses and less than proportionally between the mid and high doses, 
with AUC(0-t) increasing generally proportionally across the dose range. Following repeat daily dosing, 
systemic exposure was comparable to that on Day 1 across the dose range in females, although an 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a 
variation

appreciable decrease in exposure in males was noted at Week 13. Where both sexes received a 
comparable dose, systemic exposure to olaparib was consistently greater in females than in males. 
A summary of toxicokinetic data is provided in Table 3. 
Oral administration of olaparib at dose levels of up to 1000 mg/kg/day in males and 100 mg/kg/day in 
females was tolerated, with no compound-related deaths. Throughout the dosing period, bodyweight gain 
and food consumption were reduced in both sexes at all dose levels. 
Haematological changes, including decreases in red blood cell parameters (red blood cell count, 
haemoglobin and haematocrit), leukocyte counts (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils 
and/or basophils), and reticulocytes, were seen for males at 1000 mg/kg/day and for females at 50 or 100 
mg/kg/day. In addition increases in mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, red blood 
cell distribution width and platelet count were seen for females at 100 mg/kg/day. Plasma chemistry 
changes, including decreases in creatinine, cholesterol and total protein levels in males at 250 and/or 
1000 mg/kg/day and triglycerides and total protein in females at dose levels up to 100 mg/kg/day. 
Glucose levels were higher in both males and females at all dose levels. 
Oral administration of olaparib to rats for 3 months was associated with findings in lympho-haemopoietic 
organs and small intestine. There were dose-related lower group mean thymus weights in females at ≥ 25 
mg/kg/day and in males at 1000 mg/kg/day. 
Treatment-related histopathological findings were present in the bone marrow (decreased 
haematopoietic cellularity), lymphoid organs (lymphoid depletion: thymus, GALT, mesenteric lymph 
node), spleen/ liver (increased extramedullary haematopoiesis, females only), spleen (decreased 
incidence of extramedullary haemopoiesis, males, only) and/or small intestine (epithelial degeneration in 
duodenum, jejunum, ileum, males only) for males at 1000 mg/kg/day and/or females at 50 or 100 
mg/kg/day. Regenerative erythropoiesis was seen in the liver, spleen, and femoral and sternal bone 
marrow of females at 100 mg/kg/day, which was considered to be secondary to the anaemia seen in 
these animals. 
Based on the effects on bodyweight gain, a no effect dose level (NOEL) was not determined. However, 
based on haematology and pathology findings, the no-adverse-effect dose level (NOAEL) for this study 
was considered to be 25 mg/kg/day for females and 250 mg/kg/day for males.

Genotoxicity 
No additional genotoxicity studies were conducted. Olaparib previously showed no mutagenic potential, 
but was clastogenic in mammalian cells in vitro. When dosed orally to rats, olaparib induced micronuclei 
in bone marrow. This clastogenicity is consistent with the known pharmacology of olaparib and indicates 
potential for genotoxicity in man.

Carcinogenicity 
No additional carcinogenicity studies were conducted. 
Reproduction toxicity 
No additional fertility, early embryonic and embryo-fœtal development studies were conducted.  
As seen previously in a female fertility study, rats were dosed until implantation. Although extended 
oestrus was observed in some animals, mating performance and pregnancy rate was not affected. 
However, there was a slight reduction in embryofoetal survival. In previous rat embryofoetal 
development studies, and at dose levels that did not induce significant maternal toxicity, olaparib caused 
reduced embryofoetal survival, reduced foetal weight and foetal developmental abnormalities, including 
major eye malformations (e.g. anophthalmia, microphthalmia), vertebral/rib malformation, and visceral 
and skeletal abnormalities. 
Other toxicity studies 
No juvenile and prenatal or postnatal development studies were conducted nor required 
Olaparib will be administered via the same oral route so no local tolerance studies are required. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
This extension is not expected to change the usage of the product in such a way that a new environmental 
risk assessment is necessary. Since the environmental risk assessment was previously evaluated on the 
substance and not on the pharmaceutical form, no further studies were required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Olaparib was first indicated as monotherapy for deleterious or suspected deleterious germline 
BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have been treated with ≥3 prior lines of 
chemotherapy. PARP inhibitor sensitivity is broader than BRCA and HRR deficiencies and may extend to 
non-HRR DNA damage response deficiencies and pathways as well (Postel-Vinay et al 2013, Cerrato et al, 
2016, Murata et al, 2016, Lu et al 2017). Moreover, the extension to high-grade serous ovarian cancer is 
plausible because 51% of these cancers have compromised HRR and also that 5–7% of ovarian cancer 
cases will have somatic HRD (Cooke et al. 2011; Fray et al. 2017). 
However, from a pharmacological perspective, high levels of continuous dosing of olaparib are still best in 
a maintenance setting and while intermittent breaks or reductions in dose are still capable of keeping the 
regressed tumours under control as long as the initial treatment resulted in little or no detectable (<2% 
in this tumour model) residual disease, there is an increase in likelihood of tumour progression on 
treatment with lower or intermittent dosing. 
To build a preclinical PKPD/efficacy relationship model, an olaparib sensitive PDX model (HBCx-10) has 
been used. The data obtained suggest that for efficacy in the HBCx-10 preclinical model either the IC50 
of PARP-1 (56.5 nM for tumour PAR) needs to be exceeded for more than 13 hours or the IC90 (382 nM 
for tumour PAR) for more than 6 hours. 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a 
variation  
EMA/819800/2017 
Page 31/163 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanistic modelling has been performed of the PKPD relationship and the binding kinetics of PARP-1, 
NAD, DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) and a PARP inhibitor (PARPi). This model has been used to gain 
insight into the relationship between tumour pharmacodynamics as measured by PAR concentration 
reduction and the resulting efficacy as measured by tumour growth inhibition in the HBCx-10 patient 
derived xenograft model. The results of the mechanistic model simulations suggest that as expected, 
there is an inverse relationship between PAR and SSB. However, importantly, there are only significant 
increases in SSB numbers when PAR is reduced by more than 90%. This model predicts that only by 
maintaining significant (>90%) inhibition of PAR levels can a large increase in SSB be generated that 
would translate into tumour cell death, for example those lacking homologous recombination repair 
(HRR) functionality. 
Furthermore, the clinical activity of olaparib appears to be associated with doses that maintain the 
unbound steady state trough concentration above the IC90 for PARP inhibition. In previously published 
clinical trials with olaparib in breast and ovarian cancer patients carrying germ line BRCA mutations (Tutt 
et al, 2010; Audeh et al, 2010), an olaparib capsule dose of 400 mg bd was shown to be more clinically 
effective than a 100 mg bd capsule dose. The overlay of PK data from multiple clinical capsule doses of 
olaparib, where outcome data are available, support the idea that consistent inhibition of the target to 
achieve >90% inhibition of PAR in tumours is likely to be required for single agent monotherapy in 
sensitive tumour backgrounds. For the tablet formulation it can be seen that the 300 mg bd dose provides 
coverage well above this preclinical IC90 value. 
Additional work using the HBCx-10 BRCAm PDX model provides preclinical evidence for olaparib 
maintenance treatment following initial tumour shrinkage (this time after 100 mg/kg continuous dosing 
for 35 days). The data demonstrate that in a maintenance setting, lower doses of continuous treatment 
(50 mg/kg od) dosing as well as high intermittent (100 mg/kg od1 week on/ 1 week off) dosing can 
maintain tumour regression if continued day 35 day. If tumours are left to progress after cessation of 
olaparib dosing at day 35, then high continuous dosing (100 mg/kg od) has the best chance to regress the 
tumours a second time. 
The full non-clinical safety profile of olaparib was previously assessed at time of the initial marketing 
authorisation application. Additional non-pivotal dose setting toxicology studies of up to 3 months 
duration have been conducted in rats to support dose selection for future carcinogenicity studies in this 
species, to support earlier disease indications. Whilst not required to support this current advanced 
cancer indication, data from these studies were provided by the applicant because the administered doses 
and exposures in these studies were higher than those achieved on the pivotal rat repeat dose studies. 
Systemic exposure to olaparib was demonstrated at all dose levels. In males systemic exposure to 
olaparib increased generally dose-proportionally between the low and mid doses and less than 
proportionally between mid and high doses. In females, Cmax increased in a generally dose-proportional 
manner between the low and mid doses and less than proportionally between the mid and high doses, 
with AUC(0-t) increasing generally proportionally across the dose range. Following repeat daily dosing, 
systemic exposure was comparable to that on Day 1 across the dose range in females, although an 
appreciable decrease in exposure in males was noted at Week 13. Where both sexes received a 
comparable dose, systemic exposure to olaparib was consistently greater in females than in males. 
Olaparib toxicokinetics were also explored in male and female rats when the agent was formulated in 
0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in 0.1% Tween 80 in water. These data are exemplified by studies 
8000589 (28 days) and 526803 (13 weeks) (Table 7). In both studies, female rats were dosed at lower 
levels than male rats reflecting previous data that demonstrated higher clearance in male rats. 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a 
variation  
EMA/819800/2017 
Page 32/163 
 
 
 
 
 
In both studies, on day 1 exposure (Cmax and AUC(0-t)) in male rats increased less than in proportion to 
dose over the dose range. Similar observations were made on the last day of dosing but exposures were 
markedly lower after multiple doses, which suggested either induction of clearance pathways or decrease 
absorption had occurred. On day 1, female animals also exhibited a less than proportional increase in 
exposure but this was much less pronounced than in male rats. There was no consistent evidence of 
decreased exposure in female rats after multiple doses. 
Where male and female rats received the same dose, the exposure in male animals was much lower on 
the first day of dosing in both studies. This effect was more obvious on the last day of dosing. 
No new target organs of toxicity were identified. These data confirm that the principal target organ for 
toxicity is the bone marrow, with associated changes in peripheral haematology parameters. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity has been observed in the new repeat-dose toxicity studies performed in rats (1 
month non-GLP & 3 months GLP). Olaparib related histopathological findings were observed within the 
intestinal tract in male animals following 4 or 13 weeks daily oral dosing with the compound formulated 
in 0.5% hydroxylpropyl methyl cellulose and 0.1% Tween 80. Reversibility was not assessed in these 
studies.  Olaparib is recognized as having an effect on bone marrow and peripheral blood, the mechanism 
of which may be related to the pharmacology and mechanism of action of olaparib as an inhibitor of 
PARP-1 and PARP-2. PARP-2 appears to play a key role in the survival of haematopoietic stem/progenitor 
cells under steady-state conditions and in response to stress (Farrés 2013). The degenerative changes 
observed within the intestines were characterised by the presence of scattered, shrunken, pyknotic 
nuclear cell debris located within the base of the intestinal crypts. This pattern of change is considered 
consistent with an effect on the proliferative tissue compartment and it is not unreasonable to assume 
that PARP-2 may similarly affect survival of intestinal stem/progenitor cells in this highly proliferative 
tissue. This finding was not accompanied by any inflammatory changes or concomitant downstream 
structural loss of integrity (e.g. villous atrophy). Given the minimal severity of the changes and the 
breadth of experience with other agents that induce similar degenerative changes in the crypt epithelium, 
the weight of evidence suggests that full recovery would occur upon cessation of dosing. These findings 
are now reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC of both Lynparza capsule and tablet. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted are considered appropriate and supportive of the potential efficacy of the 
clinical dose for the 300mg tablet formulation and of the changes introduced to section 5.3 of the SmPC 
of capsule formulation. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns the introduction of new 150 and 100 mg tablets with a claimed indication: 
“monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed 
high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete 
response or partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy”.  
The claimed posology is reduced to 300 mg b.i.d comparatively to approved dose for capsules: 400 mg 
b.i.d in the BRCA mutated patients.

In addition, the MAH has applied for a modification of the product information of the capsule formulation 
in line with the proposed product information for the tablets. 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The claimed indication for olaparib is, as monotherapy, for the maintenance treatment of adult patients 
with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube or primary 
peritoneal) who are in response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based 
chemotherapy. 
The indication claimed by this extension concerns olaparib tablet. SOLO2 study, which is limited to 
germline BRCA mutated patients, is the only clinical trial provided in support of this application with this 
formulation.  
Study 19 was supportive for the initial Olaparib capsule application. Updated results are provided here to 
support extension in non BRCA mutated population. Additional PK studies are provided to support 
extrapolation of capsule data to tablet form.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The olaparib clinical pharmacology programme was designed to characterise the PK and investigate the key 
factors that could potentially contribute to variability in exposure to olaparib in the target ovarian cancer 
population. The PK and PD of olaparib following dosing with the tablet formulation have been characterised in 
patients with advanced solid tumours and in the proposed target patient population.  
The tablet formulation has been investigated and characterized in numerous formal PK studies (Studies 01, 04, 
05, 06, 07, 08 and 024). These studies were part of the initial submission and have been assessed in the context 
of the initial application of the capsules. In general, appropriate and validated bioanalytical methods were used 
to determine concentrations of olaparib.  
The pivotal phase 3 Efficacy/Safety study (SOLO2) submitted as a support to this extension application 
investigated only the tablet formulation. In this study, sparse samples were collected in a sub-group of patients 
in order to characterize the PKs of the tablets and identify the covariates influencing it in the target population 
using a population PK approach (PPK). In addition, the comparability of systemic exposure to olaparib with both 
modalities of treatment (capsules 400 mg b.i.d versus Tablets 300 mg bid) was reviewed in order to elicit the 
findings of the phase 2 study to the claimed tablets.

Relevant data could be obtained from formal study 024 already reviewed but also from studies D0810C00001 
and D081BC00001 conducted in Japanese patients (Study D0810C00001 investigated olaparib PK of capsules 
while study D081BC00001 investigated the tablets). For clarity purpose the findings of these studies are 
compiled and presented below in a tabulated format:

Following oral administration of olaparib via the tablet formulation (2 x 150 mg), absorption is rapid with median 
peak plasma concentrations typically achieved 1.5 hours after dosing. 
Food effect 
Table 3: Relative bioavailability of olaparib 300 mg tablet dose in fed and fasted states 
Co-administration with food slowed the rate (tmax delayed by 2.5 hours and Cmax reduced by approximately 
21%) but did not significantly affect the extent of absorption of olaparib (AUC increased 8%). Consequently, 
Lynparza may be taken without regard to food. 
Distribution 
As requested in the original procedure, a new study, Study BS001884-14, has been carried out to determine the 
in vitro binding of olaparib metabolites (AZ14102299, AZ14102296 and AZ14102567) to plasma proteins in the 
mouse and human.

The objective of this study was to determine the plasma protein binding of olaparib metabolites (AZ14102299, 
AZ14102296 and AZ14102567) in the male mouse and mixed human plasma. The animal species chosen 
reflects the species to be used in the pharmacological and safety assessment of AZ14102299, AZ14102296 and 
AZ14102567 during the pharmaceutical development of the compound. 
The in vitro binding of AZ14102299, AZ14102296 and AZ14102567 to plasma protein from the male mouse and 
mixed human has been measured over a concentration range of 0.1 to 100 μmol/L AZ14102299, AZ14102296 
and AZ14102567.

For AZ14102299, the percentage unbound was not concentration dependent in the mouse over the range 0. 1 
to 100 μmol/L, and the percentage unbound was ranging from 44.0 % at 0.1 μmol/L to 45.0 % at 100 μmol/L. 
There was a trend for higher percentage unbound at higher AZ14102299 concentrations in the human, and the 
percentage unbound was concentration dependent ranging from 6.82 % at 0.1 μmol/L to 47.1 % at 100 μmol/L. 
For AZ14102296, the percentage unbound was not concentration dependent in the mouse and human over the 
range 0. 1 to 100 μmol/L. The percentage unbound was ranging from 60.1 % at 0.1 μmol/L to 57.1 % at 100 
μmol/L in the mouse and ranging from 56.8 % at 0.1 μmol/L to 60.3 % at 100 μmol/L in the human. 
For AZ14102567, there was a trend for higher percentage unbound at higher AZ14102567 concentrations in the 
mouse and human. The percentage unbound was concentration dependent ranging from 24.6 % at 0.1 μmol/L 
to 31.5 % at 100 μmol/L in the mouse and ranging from 11.6 % at 0.1 μmol/L to 23.4 % at 100 μmol/L in the 
human 
Metabolism and elimination 
The metabolism of olaparib is extensive and the data from Studies KMX009 and KMX041 submitted in the 
original dossier indicated that the metabolism of olaparib was predominantly via CYP3A4. 
The 3 main metabolites were M12 (ring-open hydroxyl-cyclopropyl: 12.3%), M15 (monooxygenated: 9.4%) and 
M18 (dehydrogenated piperazine: 7.9%).  
The following new studies were conducted to further characterise these metabolites: 
Study BE000726-40 
The objectives of this study were to structurally characterise M12 and M18 and confirm the identity of M12, M15 
and M18 using authentic reference standards where possible. In study BE001071-20, M15 could be 
unambiguously identified as the 4- fluorophenol (hydroxy)methyl metabolite, whilst M18 was only detected as 
the chemical decomposition product, the dehydrogenated piperizine, and M12 could only be confirmed as 
a+H2O metabolite having the aromatic signals intact. 
This study has enabled the structural characterisation of Codexis generated metabolite M12 as the ring open 
piperazin-3-ol. M18 could not be fully characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy or 2D 1H-13C NMR experiments, 
however in combination with mass spectrometry and semicarbazide trapping it was possible to infer the 
structure to be a monooxygeneated piperazine (piperazin-ol) metabolite in either the 2 or 3 position. It is 
proposed that M12 was derived from the corresponding Piperazin-ol. Further analysis the H-ADME plasma 
samples with the synthetic standards of M12 (M12a and M12b) and M15 by co-chromatography and MS 
confirmed that M12b was the M12 metabolite reported in the H-ADME study (KMX032) as the ring open 
piperazin-3-ol, the M12a metabolite/isomer as the ring open piperazin-2-ol and M15 as the 4-fluorophenol 
(hydroxy)methyl metabolite. 
Study BE001071-20 
The objectives of this study were to characterise the three major metabolites (M12, M15 and M18) of AZD2281 
in human plasma from the human ADME metabolite identification study (KMX032) using UHPLC-UV-MS mass

spectrometry and NMR. The samples used in this study were from the single oral dose to man study 
(D0816C00006). Cross-subject pooled urine and plasma samples were analysed spanning 0-24 h. 
UHPLC-UV-MS was used for the detection and identification of M12, M15 and M18 from study D0816C00006. LC 
fractionation of these metabolites followed by 1H NMR analysis was used to define their structures. 
The three major metabolites identified from study D0816C00006, M12, M15 and M18 were isolated using 
fraction collection and analysed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. These metabolites were identified as M12 (a +H2O 
metabolite, structure as yet unidentified by 1H NMR spectroscopy), M15 [4-fluorophenol(hydroxy)methyl] and 
M18 (+O metabolite) that degraded to a single -H2O product prior to NMR analysis. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The PK of olaparib following dosing with the tablet formulation have been characterised in patients with 
advanced solid tumours and in the proposed target patient population. In addition to the information collected 
in phase I studies, PK data are available from study SOLO2 and a population PK analysis has been performed:   
Study D0816C00002 (SOLO 2) 
This study is a Phase III Randomised, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled, Multicentre Study of Olaparib 
Maintenance Monotherapy in Platinum Sensitive Relapsed BRCA Mutated Ovarian Cancer Patients who are in 
Complete or Partial Response Following Platinum based Chemotherapy 
The PK analysis set (93 patients) comprised all patients who received study treatment as per protocol, did not 
violate or deviate from the protocol in ways that would significantly affect the PK analyses and had valid PK data. 
The majority of the patients who were excluded from the PK analysis set were not included due to having no 
analysable PK data (no PK sample was collected). 
The plasma concentration-time data were analysed by nonlinear mixed effects modelling using NONMEM 
software in order to characterise the PK and exposure-response of olaparib for relevant efficacy and safety 
endpoints (see population PK analysis below). 
Population PK analysis  
Two separate reports were submitted for tablet formulation in addition to the report submitted for capsule 
formulation, reflecting the sequential approach taken by the applicant during the modelling exercise. 
A.  Pooled population PKPD analysis of olaparib tablet (olaparib-MS-02) 
The objectives of the analysis were to: 1) develop a population PK model that could describe the time course of 
olaparib in cancer patients including exploring the impact of covariates on relevant PK parameters, and further, 
to generate individual PK parameter estimates for each individual included in the analysis; and 2) develop an 
exposure/safety response model(s) if they are supported by exploratory analyses. 
A population PK model was developed using plasma concentration data obtained after single and multiple doses 
of olaparib tablet (ranging from 100 to 450 mg) in 5 Phase I studies in patients with solid tumours 
(D081BC00001[01], D0816C00004 [04], D0816C00007 [07], D0816C00008 [08], D0816C00024 [24]). In 
total, 7020 observations from a total of 296 patients were included in the population PK model development. Of

296 patients, the majority were female (85%), and Caucasian (90%) or Asian (7.8%). The mean (range) of age, 
and body weight were 57 (19 to 85) years and 72 (34 to 147) kg, respectively. 
Olaparib tablet plasma concentration-time data were analysed using a nonlinear mixed effects modelling 
approach. After identification of the base model, covariates were evaluated using a stepwise covariate model 
(SCM) search process The final population PK structure model was described by a linear 2- compartment model 
with sequential zero- and first-order absorption rates (Ka) and first-order elimination. The olaparib elimination 
was described by 2 distinct clearances (CL) between single and multiple dose administrations. The predicted 
population mean estimates of CL are 6.2 L/h and 5.0 L/h, for single and multiple dose administrations, 
respectively. The population mean estimates for volume of distribution of the central compartment (V2), 
intercompartment clearance (Q), volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment (V3), duration of the 
zero-order absorption (D1), and Ka were 4.4 L, 1.49 L/h, 23.6 L, 0.432 hours and 0.211 1/h respectively. The 
estimated inter-individual variability (IIV) (coefficient of variation, CV%) for CL at steady-state, V2, Q, V3, D1 
and Ka were 45%, 70%,57%, 73%, 88%, and 27%, respectively. Covariates including age, body weight, 
gender, race, tablet strength, hepatic and renal function markers were evaluated in the population analysis, and 
the only significant covariate impacting olaparib PK in the final model was the olaparib tablet strength, which 
affected Ka.  
Final model parameters, goodness of fit plots and visual predictive check plots are displayed below.

Figure 2: Visual predictive check for the final olaparib PK model  
Olaparib Ka increased by 74% with a 100 mg strength tablet compared to a 150 mg strength tablet. However, 
the model predicted olaparib area under the plasma concentration-time curve at steady state (AUCss) was 
similar, and the maximum plasma concentration at steady state (Cmax,ss) was slightly higher for the 300 mg 
dose twice daily (bd) given as 3x100 mg tablets compared with 2x150 mg tablets bd; the geometric mean ratios 
of 3x300 mg tablet strength over 2x150 mg tablet strength were 0.98 and 1.28 for AUCss and Cmax,ss, 
respectively. The primary tablet strength used in clinical studies was 150 mg, while 100 mg tablet strength was 
available for dose reduction. 
The final population PK model was used to obtain individual empirical Bayes estimates of PK parameters and 
exposure estimates of area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity after single dose 
administration (AUC) or AUCss (referred as AUC for both subsequently), maximum plasma concentration after 
single olaparib dose administration (Cmax) or Cmax,ss (referred as Cmax for both subsequently), and minimum 
plasma concentration at state-state (Cmin,ss) for patients included in the final dataset for the population PK 
analysis. The estimated geometric mean AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss for the proposed therapeutic dose, 300 
mg dose bd were 59.7 (50 CV%) μg.h/mL, 9.1 (39 CV%) μg/mL, and 1.95 (87 CV%) μg/mL, respectively. 
The relationships between exposure and adverse events (AEs) were analysed by graphical exploratory analysis 
first and subsequently modelled if an apparent relationship was supported by the exploratory analysis. The 
exposure and response analysis was focused on the assessment of the impact of olaparib tablet exposure on 
typical safety events that occurred within the longest time period of olaparib treatment observed in the data (85 
days). The safety analyses used data from the patient Studies 01, 04, 07 and 08. A total of 151 patients were 
included in the safety analysis dataset. Most patients (82%) were treated with 300 mg, bd, during the multiple 
dosing period. There was no evidence to suggest that measures of exposure were predictive of anaemia, 
nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain, dysgeusia, constipation, headache, diarrhoea, 
neutrophil and platelet count, or decreased appetite. A trend was observed for decreased haemoglobin with 
increasing olaparib exposure. Therefore, exposure response modelling was conducted for AUC and haemoglobin 
measurements to quantify the potential relationship. An indirect response model with olaparib AUC inhibiting the 
haemoglobin synthesis rate in a linear relationship adequately described the relationship between olaparib 
exposure in AUC and haemoglobin response. The model estimated a mean slope to olaparib AUC of 0.002 
(g/dL)/(μg.h/mL). For a baseline haemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dL, the predicted mean haemoglobin 
concentrations on Day 85 were 8.7, 8.4 and 8 g/dL, respectively, for the predicted geometric mean AUCss (59.7 
μg.h/mL) after olaparib 300 mg bd (GMAUCss,300mgbd), 1.5x GMAUCss,300mgbd, and 2x 
GMAUCss,300mgbd. For a baseline haemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL, the predictions were 12.3, 11.6 and 
10.8 g/dL, respectively. 
B.  Population analysis of SOLO2 (Olaparib-MS-03) 
This report describes the data, methods and results for the analysis of olaparib population pharmacokinetics 
(PopPK), exposure measured as average concentration during a dosing interval (Cav) or area under the 
concentration vs. time curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax) and minimum concentration (Cmin), 
exploratory analysis or simulation for safety and efficacy response to olaparib exposure for the SOLO2 study.

Variations of these metrics were calculated to represent patients' overall exposure given their actual dosing 
history and the multiple dose nature of the study (e.g. average cumulative which took the average of the metrics 
over time for each patient, and a daily version which took the average within each day considering olaparib's 
twice-daily dosing regimen). The objectives of this analysis were: 
- To evaluate predictability of the previously-developed olaparib PopPK model to olaparib pharmacokinetics (PK) 
from the SOLO2 study, and to develop a PopPK model for olaparib for study SOLO2 if needed. 
- To obtain individual empirical Bayes estimates (EBE) of olaparib compartment PK parameters and exposure 
measured by Cav and AUC (both daily and average cumulative throughout treatment); Cmax; and Cmin in 
SOLO2 study for subjects with plasma concentrations available. 
- To explore and model (if feasible) the relationship between olaparib plasma exposure (as represented by a 
metric such as Cav) and selected efficacy and safety variables. 
When applying the previously developed Phase I Tablet Analysis PopPK model with all the parameters  fixed, to 
SOLO2 data the model showed an overall over-prediction of the data. Hence, the previously developed model 
was refined and most parameters were re-estimated. The random effects model was refined to include inter 
individual variability (IIV) on CL/F, apparent central volume of distribution (Vc/F) and duration of zero order 
absorption (D1) only and the additive residual variability was removed. Due to only one PK sample per patient 
on Day 1 the single dose CL/F was restrained to the ratio of single dose to multiple dose CL/F from the previous 
model. In addition, the e 
effect of tablet strength on absorption rate constant (ka) for 100 mg and the combination of 100 mg and 150 mg 
tablet was  fixed to the value estimated from the previous model. Of the primary covariates including WT, age, 
race (white vs Asian), creatinine clearance (CLcr), albumin, and hepatic impairment based on the NCI criteria 
(HINC) none were found to be statistically significant. The population mean estimates for multiple dose CL/F, 
Vc/F and ka for the 150 mg tablet were 7.40 L/h (relative standard error (RSE): 4.21 %), 7.92 L (RSE: 14.6 %) 
and 3.22 h�1 (RSE: 20.6 %), respectively. IIV for CL/F, Vc/F and D1 were estimated to 36.5 coefficient of 
variation (CV)% (RSE: 17.6 %), 39.2 CV% (RSE: 38.5 %) and 84.1 CV% (RSE: 37.1 %), respectively. 
Final model parameters, goodness of fit plots and visual predictive check plots are displayed below.

The estimate of the multiple dose CL/F in this analysis was somewhat higher as compared to the Phase I Tablet 
Analysis where the multiple dose CL/F was estimated to 5.04 L/h. This corresponds to an estimated geometric 
mean area under the concentration vs. time curve at steady-state (AUCss) of 40.7 µg*h/mL compared to 59.7 
µg*h/mL following multiple dosing of 300 mg bid for SOLO2 and Phase I Tablet Analysis respectively, suggesting 
approximately 30% lower exposure in SOLO2 as compared to previous Phase I Tablet Analysis. This was not due 
to differences in the patient population datasets used for the analyses. The patient population datasets included 
in the Phase I Tablet Analysis and the SOLO2 had similar renal and hepatic function and demographic data. Age, 
WT and ethnicity were not significant covariates in the Phase I Tablet Analysis nor the current analysis and are 
therefore unlikely to have affected exposure to olaparib.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
•  Single dose 
The exposure data (Cmax and AUC0-12) for Study 04 (300 mg), Study 07 (100 mg), Study 08 (300 mg) and Study 
24 (25 mg to 450 mg) have been combined and analysed using a power model. The graphical results show that 
for AUC0-12 a 100% increase in dose would be predicted to give a 103% increase in AUC0-12 and 90% CI 92%, 
115% and for Cmax a 100% increase in dose would be predicted to give a 78% increase in Cmax, 90% CI 71%, 
86%. Therefore, exposure appears to increase proportionally with dose for AUC0-12 and slightly less than 
proportionally with dose for Cmax, a doubling in dose is predicted to give an 80% increase in Cmax. 
Table 9: Olaparib tablet dose proportionality: single dose AUC(0-12) in Studies 04 (300 mg), 07 (100 mg), 08 
(300 mg) and 24 (25 mg to 450 mg)

•  Multiple dose 
Similarly, the population PK analysis Olaparib-MS-02 did not show any deviation from dose proportionality 
based on the dose-adjusted observations after single dose or multiple doses. Following the dosing of the tablet 
formulation, the AUC for the tablet formulation was shown to increase proportionally with dose for the dose 
range 25 to 450 mg.  
• 
Time dependency 
Based on its single dose half-life, it would be expected that steady state exposure would be achieved within 3 
days after commencing dosing with olaparib. Study 04 has shown that for the olaparib tablet formulation 
time-dependent PK was observed. In study 2, with the capsule formulation, comparison of the Day 14 AUC0-24 
with the Day 1 AUC for the patients, showed that for 8 of the 12 patients where the comparison was possible, the 
Day 14 AUC0-24 was within 30% of the Day 1 AUC value, suggesting there was no marked time dependency in the 
pharmacokinetics of olaparib. 
Special populations 
Investigation of olaparib PK in subjects with renal insufficiency has been requested by the CHMP during the initial 
evaluation of the MA for the capsule formulation and was due by the MAH as a post-authorisation measure.  
Study D0816C00006 was a 2-part, Phase I, multicentre study in patients with advanced solid tumours. Part A 
was an open-label, parallel group, single dose study comparing the PK of olaparib in patients with moderate or 
mild renal impairment to patients with normal renal function. Each patient received a single oral dose of olaparib 
(300 mg) given via the tablet formulation on Day 1. In Part B, patients were allowed continued access to olaparib 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation

(300 mg bd) for 12 months. During and after Part B, patients could continue to take olaparib, if they and the 
investigator deemed it appropriate, until such time as their disease progressed, the investigator believed they 
were no longer deriving clinical benefit, or they stopped taking olaparib for any other reason 
A total of 44 patients (15 patients with normal renal function, 15 patients with mild renal impairment and 14 
patients with moderate impairment) were assigned to Part A treatment and received 1 dose of olaparib. The 
majority of patients assigned to treatment completed Part A of the study (43 patients [97.7%]), with 1 patient 
being discontinued from the study due to an AE. All of the remaining 43 (97.7%) patients continued to Part B of 
the study. The population was half female (19 males and 25 females), aged between 32 and 76 years and the 
most common primary tumour locations were ovary, renal and breast. All patients had an ECOG performance 
status ≤1. 
In patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] 51 to 80 mL/min), there was a small 
increase in mean olaparib exposure, 15% for Cmax and 24% for AUC. This was not considered to be clinically 
relevant and no olaparib dose adjustment is warranted in patients with mild renal impairment. In patients with 
moderate renal impairment (CrCL 31 to 50 mL/min), Cmax and AUC increased 26% and 44% compared to 
patients with normal renal function. Patients with moderate renal impairment are recommended to take a 
starting dose of olaparib of 200 mg bd (equivalent to a total daily dose of 400 mg) and olaparib is not 
recommended for patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (CrCL ≤30 mL/min) since 
there are no data in such patients. 
Table 11: Treatment ratio of mild renal impairment to normal renal function of olaparib 
Sections 4.2 and 5.2 were updated with the recommendations for patients with renal impairment based on the 
results of the study D0816C00006 (MEA 006). 
The study D0816C00005 in hepatic impaired patients has been completed. In the study, 52 patients were 
enrolled and 31 patients (13 patients with normal hepatic function, 10 patients with mild hepatic impairment and 
8 patients with moderate hepatic impairment) were assigned to treatment. All patients assigned to treatment 
completed Part A (PK assessment) of the study and all continued to Part B (continued access and safety 
monitoring) of the study (31 patients). All 31 (100%) patients discontinued treatment during Part B of the study.

Table 12: Treatment ratio of mild and moderate hepatic impairment compared to normal 
Results from Part A of the study for patients with normal hepatic function and for patients with mild hepatic 
impairments were provided as part of this extension application. The results were used to support dosing 
recommendation for patients with mild hepatic impairment in the prescribing information for the capsule 
formulation. In this extension application were provided the results from the moderate hepatic impairment 
cohort in Part A and all patients in Part B. 
From the results obtained in study D0816C00005 Part B, a slight 13% decrease in Cmax (mean ratio 0.87; 90% 
CI: 0.63, 1.22) and a slight 8% increase in AUC (mean ratio 1.08; 90% CI: 0.66, 1.73) were observed in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. No additional 
safety signals were identified in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In this context, it can be concluded 
that no dose-adjustment is needed in this subpopulation.  
The population PK analysis in Olaparib-MS-002 report did not identify body weight, age and gender as having a 
significant impact on olaparib PK after a single dose or at steady state. There are insufficient data to evaluate the 
potential effect of race on olaparib pharmacokinetics as clinical experience is mainly collected in Whites (94% of 
patients were Caucasian). In the limited data available, there was no evidence of any marked ethnic difference 
in the PK of olaparib between Japanese and Caucasian patients. In the same way, the population PK analysis did 
not identify race as having an impact on olaparib PK. 
Interactions 
The effects of olaparib on the main CYP450 enzymes and on the main efflux/uptake transporters, as a substrate, 
inhibitor and/or inducer, have been investigated and previously assessed in previous applications. New data 
were provided as part of this extension application: an UGT in vitro study and PBPK modelling and simulations. 
In vitro data showed that olaparib may have the potential to cause CYP3A reversible inhibition, CYP3A time 
dependent inhibition, CYP3A induction as well as UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1 inhibition. The effect of 
olaparib on a sensitive CYP3A or UGT1A1 substrate has not been tested in clinical studies but PBPK simulations 
predicted olaparib to be a weak CYP3A inhibitor in vivo and predicted no effect on UGT1A1.

Study 8305966   
In this study, the inhibitory potential of AZD2281 on UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 was determined in vitro by using 
pooled human hepatic microsomes and selective substrates.  
AZD2281 showed concentration-dependent inhibition of UGT1A1 at 30 and 100 μM, but not at lower 
concentrations (0.243, 0.81, 2.7, and 9 μM). At 30 and 100 μM of AZD2281, the mean activity remaining was 
81.3 and 48.1% of the vehicle control, corresponding to 18.7 and 51.9% inhibition, respectively. The IC50 value 
of UGT1A1 inhibition was calculated to be 96.7 μM. Under the same experimental conditions, troglitazone (a 
known inhibitor of UGT1A1) at 25 μM demonstrated significant inhibition of UGT1A1 (74.7%). 
Inhibition of UGT2B7 by AZD2281 was also conducted and the data are presented (up to 100 μM) showed no 
inhibition of UGT2B7. The mean activity remaining was ≥87.3% of the vehicle control. Under the same 
experimental conditions, mefenamic acid (a known inhibitor of UGT2B7) at 50 μM demonstrated potent 
inhibition of UGT2B7 (91.2%). 
Induction of CYP1A2 and 2B6 has been shown in vitro, with CYP2B6 being the most likely to be induced to a 
clinically relevant extent. Even if the importance of the effect on CYP2B6 was lower that elicited by the positive 
control phenobarbital, small but notable increases in bupropion hydroxylation in hepatocytes treated with 
olaparib at 30 µM were observed as specified by the applicant.  The applicant states that it is unlikely that 
administration of olaparib in vivo would result in a clinically significant induction effect. Based on evaluation 
using enzyme activity, olaparib was not considered an inducer of CYP2C9 and 2C19. 
In vitro, olaparib has been shown to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2K. 
PBPK modeling and simulations 
New simulations have been provided assessing the effect of olaparib as a victim and perpetrator. PBPK 
simulations and modeling is qualified only for enzyme inhibitions (CYP, UGT) and if the input parameters are 
reliable and sensitive analysis performed. The assessment of this study was limited to CYP and UGT inhibition.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Olaparib is an inhibitor of human poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase enzymes (PARP-1, PARP-2 and PARP-3), which 
are multifunctional proteins involved in multiple cellular processes (Gibson and Kraus, 2012). 
Besides inhibiting enzymatic activity, cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors is due to PARP trapping at DNA and leading 
to obstructed replication folk, but could also interfere in the PARP function in replication folk protection and 
restart (Bryant et al, 2009; Schlacher et al, 2011). 
The recent profiling of PARP inhibitors revealed that olaparib is a potent inhibitor of PARP1 but is less selective. 
It inhibited full length PARP1 with 10-fold higher potency than its catalytic fragment and full length PARP2 with 
20-fold higher potency than its catalytic fragment (Thorsell et al, 2017).

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Inhibition of PARP-1 activity has been explored as a pharmacodynamic endpoint in tumour and surrogate tissue 
(peripheral blood mononuclear cells - PBMCs) collected primarily from the patients dosed in Studies 02 and 07. 
These studies were assessed as part of this initial marketing authorisation application. 
Study 24 
The secondary objective of this study described in the PK part was to compare the extent of PARP inhibition 
achieved in PBMCs following dosing of both the Melt-extrusion (tablet) formulation and existing Gelucire 44/14 
(capsule) formulation. 
To compare the extent of PARP inhibition achieved in PBMCs following dosing of both the tablet and capsule 
formulation, PBMC samples were obtained from the 18 patients dosed in the PKP phase, prior to and at 3, 10 and 
24 hours after single dosing with the capsule and the tablet formulation. The PARP inhibition data obtained are 
summarised in the tale below: 
Table 5 Mean % inhibition of PARP-1 from baseline (± SE) in PBMC samples following administration of single 
oral doses of the tablet or capsule formulation (n=6 per cohort) 
The PARP inhibition data showed high variability and an average extent of inhibition from baseline which 
generally fell between 20 and 80%.  
Genetic differences in PD response 
Based on the main mechanism of action, HRD tumours would be the most sensitive to PARP inhibitors and to 
platinum agents. Therefore, biomarkers of HRD would be predictive of response to both classes of agents.  
In addition to initially provided genomic analysis data from the Study 19 using germline testing in blood (via a 
local test or the Myriad CLIA Integrated BRACAnalysis® test) or from testing a tumour sample (using a test 
performed by Foundation Medicine), exploratory diagnostic testing and retrospective analysis were conducted 
based on tumour samples with an aim to further explore homologous recombination deficiency biomarkers. 
Analyses were performed on archival tumour samples (blocks or sections) for which provision was mandatory 
for participation in Study 19. 
Two types of tests have been used for analysis: Myriad myChoice HRD scores test and Foundation Medicine test 
(FMI) for detection tBRCA1/2 mutations and mutations in HRR genes.

The results in different subgroups are provided below. 
1) Myriad myChoice HRD scores were determined using an assay that calculates whole genome tumour 
loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), telomeric allelic imbalance and large-scale state transition scores (Timms et al 
2014). The HRD score is the sum of the three scores and a threshold of ≥ 42 is considered positive. Analyses 
were performed blind to previous gBRCAm and tBRCAm data. 
The overview of efficacy data in subgroups per HRD score is provided below: 
- tBRCAwt and HRD score 42 and more 
- tBRCAwt and HRD score less than 42

By Myriad HRD testing from the SOLO2  trial (246/295 patients) of the 219 samples evaluable for the HRD score 
(89% pass), the majority (209 samples) had HRD scores of 42 or more and 10 samples had a score <42 (4.6%; 
5 were BRCA2; 4 were BRCA1 and 1 was classed by Myriad as a VUS [BRCA2 c.517-2A>G]). The only patient in 
SOLO2 for whom gene specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was called as absent (E4102507) had an HRD score 
of 53. 
The results of the both Study 19 and SOLO-2 point to the higher potential for HR deficiency in patients with BRCA 
mutations than in tBRCAwt patients, as expected. By Myriad HRD test in the Study 19, among 139 patients with 
higher HRD score (42 or more), 101 patients had tBRCA mutations, while among 60 patients with lower HRD 
score (<42), 51 patients were tBRCAwt. 
2) Tumour mutation status in BRCA1, BRCA2 and other key HRR related genes (HRRm) status was established 
using massively parallel DNA sequencing analysis at Foundation Medicine (Frampton et al 2013). Tumour 
analysis was performed on coded tumour samples, and results were returned blind to previous gBRCAm and 
tBRCAm data. The classification of variants was based on the American College of Medical Genetics 
recommendations (Richards et al 2008, Richards et al 2015). A total of 95 patients were classified as having 
tBRCAwt tumours. 
Patients in the tBRCAwt group were further subdivided into three groups: 
- HRRm: 21 patients (22%) whose tumours had at least one LOF mutation in a high confidence HRR gene with 
the HRR mutations identified as: BRIP1, CDK12, RAD54L, RAD51B, RAD54L rearr, ATM rearr, FANCA rearr, 
FANCD2, FANCI rearr, FANCL, RAD51C, RAD52 del, and XRCC3 rearr. 
- HRRunk: 16 patients with a potential LOF mutation in any gene associated with DNA repair (eg, MSH2, 
MUTYH), or in genes where a postulated role in DNA repair has been the subject of significant controversy (eg, 
EMSY) 
- HRRwt: 58 patients (61%) with no potential LOF mutations in any of the 13 genes tested that are involved in 
DNA repair.

Somatic BRCA1/2 mutations 
Further re-analysis of samples in Study 19 determined that 10% (20/209) of tumour sequenced patients have 
sBRCAm (Dougherty et al 2017).  Ten patients were treated with olaparib and 10 with placebo.  Data are 
consistent with gBRCAm patients in this smaller group of patients identified as sBRCAm in Study 19 (PFS HR 
0.23 95% CI [0.04 to 1.12]) 
Analysis by TP53 disruptive vs non-disruptive status 
The MAH provided an analysis of Study 19 based on the sub-classification of TP53 mutations according to their 
functional effects “TP53 disruptive vs non-disruptive status”. This analysis was exploratory and performed 
post-hoc in a subgroup of the full analysis set for patients that were able to be assigned a TP53 status (209/265, 
78.9%). Patients with TP53 disruptive mutations in the BRCA wild-type group treated with olaparib 
demonstrated median OS of 35.0 months compared to 25.5 months for similar patients on placebo (n=47, HR 
0.80 [95% CI 0.40, 1.52]). The mutational subgroup of 40 patients with BRCA wild-type and TP53 
non-disruptive mutation did not derive benefit from olaparib treatment, HR 1.58 (95% CI 0.77, 3.35). 
Large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1/2 genes 
Large rearrangements in the BRCA1/2 genes were detected in 4.7% (14/295) and in 7.4% (10/136) of the 
randomised patients in SOLO2 and Study 19, respectively. 
Genetic analysis in patients with long-term non-progressive disease 
Among patients with long-term non-progressive disease, 15 patients have received olaparib for more than 6 
years, 9 of which have been reported to have a BRCA mutation (5 in BRCA2, 3 in BRCA1 and 1 in both BRCA2 and 
BRCA1) in their tumour or blood sample, with 3/9 being a somatic mutation. One of the remaining 6 patients was 
not evaluable for tBRCA status testing at either Myriad or Foundation Medicine; hence 5/15 patients treated with 
olaparib for more than 6 years had no detectable BRCA mutation. Three out of these 5 patients had Myriad HRD 
scores available (2 were HRD positive and 1 was HRD negative) and 5 out of these 5 patients had HRRm status 
available (1 was HRRm, 2 were HRR uncertain and 2 were HRRwt). Of the 2 HRRwt tumours, 1 was Myriad HRD 
negative and the other was Myriad HRD status unknown.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
As part of a modelling exercise using data from Phase I studies conducted with the tablet formulation, the 
relationships between exposure and adverse events (AEs) were analysed by graphical exploratory analysis first 
and subsequently modelled if an apparent relationship was supported by the exploratory analysis. In this 
analysis, data from studies 01, 04, 07 and 08 were used. A total of 151 patients were therefore included in the 
safety analysis dataset. 
The exposure and response analysis was focused on the assessment of the impact of PK exposure of tablet 
formulation on typical safety events that occurred within the longest time period of olaparib treatment observed 
in the data (85 days). There was no evidence to suggest that measures of exposure were predictive of anaemia, 
nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain, dysgeusia, constipation, headache, diarrhoea, 
neutrophil and platelet count, or decreased appetite. A trend was observed for decreased haemoglobin with

increasing olaparib exposure. Therefore, exposure response modelling was only conducted for AUC and 
haemoglobin measurements to quantify the potential relationship. An indirect response model with olaparib AUC 
inhibiting the haemoglobin synthesis rate in a linear relationship adequately described the relationship between 
olaparib exposure in AUC and haemoglobin response. The model estimated a mean slope to olaparib AUC of 
0.002 (g/dL)/(μg.h/mL).  
The GOF and VPC displayed acceptable fitting as shown below for VPC. 
Figure 6: Visual predictive check of haemoglobin model 
For a baseline haemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dL, the predicted mean haemoglobin concentrations on Day 
85 were 8.7, 8.4 and 8 g/dL, respectively, for the predicted geometric mean AUCss (59.7 μg.h/mL) after 
olaparib 300 mg bd (GMAUCss,300mgbd), 1.5x GMAUCss, 300mgbd, and 2x GMAUCss,300mgbd. For a baseline 
haemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL, the predictions were 12.3, 11.6 and 10.8 g/dL, respectively. 
In addition to this, data from SOLO2 study were separately used to develop PK/PD models for both efficacy and 
safety endpoints using the same approach as described below. 
For efficacy, the graphical exploration of PFS, PFS2 and OS indicated no signs of potential ER. Kaplan Meier plots 
stratifying the results by tertiles of exposure (average cumulative Cav; and daily Cmax and Cmin; all at time of 
progression) showed no pattern that would suggest exposure-response relationship at the exposures analyzed 
in this study. Additionally, stratification based on baseline disease status as measured by Eastern cooperative 
oncology group (ECOG) yielded no clear ER, perhaps limited by low sample sizes in some strata. Thus, no 
modeling of ER for efficacy was performed.

For safety, haemoglobin was modelled based on previous finding of a significant ER relationship in the Phase I 
Tablet Analysis. Haemoglobin levels appeared to change over time in placebo patients, and thus time dependent 
models were evaluated. This resulted in a placebo model that considered how this effect appeared to saturate 
over time and was described by an Emax type of relationship. An indirect response model with olaparib average 
cumulative AUC inhibiting the production of haemoglobin adequately described the relationship of olaparib 
exposure and haemoglobin response. Baseline haemoglobin at start of treatment was estimated to 11.6 g/dL 
(RSE: 11.7 %). The time to reach half of maximum level in haemoglobin levels in placebo was estimated as 42.4 
days, and its Emax was estimated as 1.39 g/dL. The model estimated a linear effect of olaparib average 
cumulative AUC on the rate of synthesis of haemoglobin with a mean slope of 0.00287 (g/dL/h)/(µg*h/mL) 
(RSE: 11.7 %). At a baseline haemoglobin concentration of 11.6 g/dL, haemoglobin is predicted to decrease to 
10.3 g/dL (95% CI: 9.98-10.6 g/dL) at predicted steady-state median olaparib exposure (assuming 300 mg bid 
dosing), while if the exposure is doubled, haemoglobin is predicted to decrease to 8.93 g/dL (95% CI: 8.33-9.52 
g/dL). Final model displayed acceptable fitting as shown by VPC below. 
Figure 7: VPC of haemoglobin concentration 
The latter results were consistent with the Phase I Tablet Analysis model which predict haemoglobin 
concentrations to decrease on average to 8.7 and 9.3 g/dL for baseline haemoglobin concentrations of 11.0 and 
12.0 g/dL, respectively, when AUC is doubled.  
The graphical exploration of safety indicated an ER for fatigue and this endpoint was further explored by 
modeling. Fatigue was modelled using daily observations of graded fatigue events. A significant ER was found 
between olaparib daily Cav and the probability of observing higher grade fatigue. However, this relationship was 
relatively weak as the increased probability of fatigue when olaparib exposure is increased, are minor.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The proposed tablet formulation is clearly beneficial to the patients and represents a clear advantage over the 
capsules. The tablet formulation is designed to deliver the therapeutic dose of olaparib in fewer and smaller dose 
units, to improve bioavailability, to reduce PK variability and to have food-independent exposure. Given that the 
capsules are not bioequivalent to the tablets with respect to rate and extent of absorption, and given that dose 
adjustment could not lead to similar exposure, the two formulations should not be substituted on a 
milligram-to-milligram basis. 
ADME properties have been extensively described and have been adequately reflected in the SmPC. Olaparib is 
rapidly absorbed following oral dosing in fasting conditions, with peak plasma concentrations observed typically 
after 1.5 hours post-dose. Olaparib tablets may be taken without regard to meals. The pooled population PK 
analysis characterised the absorption phase of olaparib as a sequential zero and first-order absorption and 
showed a significant impact of olaparib tablet strength on the absorption rate constant. 
The in vitro plasma protein binding is approximately 82%. The pharmacokinetics of olaparib at the 300 mg tablet 
dose are characterised by an apparent volume of distribution of ~158 L. 
CYP3A4/5 were shown to be the enzymes primarily responsible for the metabolism of olaparib. Following a single 
dose of 14C-olaparib, ~86% of the dosed radioactivity was recovered within a 7-day collection period, ~44% via 
the urine and ~42% via the faeces. Majority of the material was excreted as metabolites. Olaparib at the 300 mg 
tablet dose is characterised by an apparent plasma clearance of ~7 L/h and a terminal half-life of 15 hours. 
Patients with moderate renal impairment are recommended to take a starting dose of olaparib of 200 mg bd 
(equivalent to a total daily dose of 400 mg). Olaparib is not recommended for patients with severe renal 
impairment or end-stage renal disease (CrCL ≤ 30 mL/min) since there are no data in such patients. 
Additional information was provided on the completion of study D0816C00005. In this context, the SmPC 
recommendations in section 4.2 concerning the moderate hepatic impaired patients and the PK properties in 
section 5.2 have been updated taking the results obtained in study D0816C00005 part B: a slight 13% decrease 
in Cmax (mean ratio 0.87; 90% CI: 0.63, 1.22) and a slight 8% increase in AUC (mean ratio 1.08; 90% CI: 
0.66, 1.73) are observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal 
hepatic function. No additional safety signals were identified in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In 
this context, it can be concluded that no dose-adjustment is needed in this subpopulation.  
The population PK analysis in Olaparib-MS-002 report did not identify body weight, age and gender as having a 
significant impact on olaparib PK after a single dose or at steady state. The population PK analysis did not 
identify race as having an impact on olaparib PK and in the limited data available, there was no evidence of any 
marked ethnic difference in the PK of olaparib between Japanese and Caucasian patients.  
The MAH provided several exploratory post-hoc analyses based on genetic analysis of tumour samples from the 
Study 19. In SOLO2 study, patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations were identified either from germline 
testing in blood via a local test or the Myriad CLIA Integrated BRACAnalysis® test or from testing a tumour 
sample using a local test. In addition, initial exploratory analysis of data from the SOLO2 for HR deficiency based 
on Myriad myChoice HRD scores has been provided. The final analysis of Myriad HRD scores testing of tumour 
samples from the SOLO2 trial will be submitted in Q1 2018.  
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation  
EMA/228768/2018 
Page 60/163 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The results of the both Study 19 and SOLO-2 point to the higher potential for HR deficiency in patients with 
BRCA1/2 mutations than in tBRCAwt patients, as expected. It is noted that there is no clear overlap between 
patients considered as having HRDneg tumours and patients with tumours not harbouring mutations in 
HRD-related genes. Other mechanisms than genetic alteration would result in functional HR deficiency. A 
substantial proportion of patients harbours tumours that are HRDneg and do not harbour mutations in 
HR-related genes. The magnitude of benefit is such patients needs further investigation. In the OPINION study 
requested to be conducted post-approval, Myriad myChoice HRD test will be used.   With the aim to define the 
subgroup of patients that would not benefit from olaparib maintenance treatment, the MAH is encouraged to 
pursue testing for the TP53 mutational status. 
Accumulating evidence starts to dissect the differential implications of BRCA1 versus BRCA2 mutations with 
regard to sensitivity to PARPi and anti-tumour response to olaparib may be different in patients harbouring 
germline BRCA1 versus BRCA2 mutations (Liu et al, 2012; Hollis et al, 2017). Clinical evidence supporting 
differential effect in patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations starts to accumulates as well (see efficacy part).  
Nevertheless, less is known about the implications of the exact mutation site within each of the two genes and 
differential impact for different BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations has been recently reviewed (Hollis et al, 2017). An 
analysis in a limited number of patients from Study 19 and SOLO2 that harboured mutations in exon 11 or RING 
domain did not allow to make definitive conclusions on differential effect. 
While the majority of germline inactivating mutations in BRCA1/2 are small-scale mutations, BRCA genes are 
prone to large rearrangements. The prevalence of large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) observed in ‘BRCA 
mutated’ group of patients (4.7% and 7.4% of BRCAm cases in SOLO2 and Study 19 respectively), is in line with 
reported prevalence. Numerous types of LGRs have been found in different populations, with variable 
frequencies (approximately 0–27% of all pathogenic variants) probably due to both ethnic diversity and 
technical approach employed (Minucci et al, 2017). Among pathogenic variants that are reported on ClinVar 
database, at least 81 BRCA1 and 17 BRCA2 variants (accounting for 8%–27% and 0%–11% of all BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 mutations, respectively) are LGRs, which account for at least 10% of the mutations in BRCA1 and 5% of 
BRCA2 mutations in outbred hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) families. High prevalence of LGRs in 
BRCA1 have been demonstrated in several European populations. The identification of LGRs has increased the 
number of informative patients who could benefit from molecular screening and associated targeted therapy 
with PARPi. Such patients would also benefit from olaparib treatment and the available data are consistent with 
data in overall population. Since BRCA1/2 genes rearrangements are representing substantial proportion of 
‘BRCA mutations’, information on the proportion of patients enrolled in studies was included in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of olaparib tablets were appropriately investigated.  
The pharmacodynamics of olaparib was investigated in studies with the capsule formulation and some additional 
data is available from studies conducted with the tablet formulation. Exploratory genetic analysis of tumour 
samples from the study 19 was provided and biomarkers of HRD will be further studied in planned and ongoing 
studies, including the requested OPINION study and ongoing ORZORA and LIGHT study. Further, the MAH is 
recommended to submit the final analysis of Myriad HRD testing of tumour samples from the SOLO2 in Q1 2018.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This application of olaparib 300 mg bd tablet formulation is based on two pivotal studies, the Phase III 
randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study, SOLO2 (conducted with the olaparib tablet 
formulation) and the Phase II randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, Study 19 
(conducted with olaparib capsule formulation). 
The claimed indication for the tablet formulation of olaparib is as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of 
adult patients with platinum sensitive relapsed (PSR) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary 
peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based 
chemotherapy. 
The recommended dose for the tablet formulation of olaparib maintenance monotherapy in patient 
platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer is 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) taken twice daily, equivalent to a 
total daily dose of 600 mg.  
The tablet formulation of olaparib has been developed to deliver a clinically therapeutic dose of olaparib in fewer 
dose units than that required for the capsule formulation. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The clinical dose taken into the pivotal Phase III SOLO2 study was determined in Study 24.   
Study 24 was originally intended to establish the comparative bioavailability of the olaparib tablet to the olaparib 
capsule. The PK Phase of the study was designed as a randomised, two-period, two-sequence, cross-over 
single-dose study under fasting conditions in cancer patients with advances solid tumours. Even if this study was 
not powered as a bioequivalence study, data showed that the 200 mg bd tablet dose failed to meet the criteria 
to be considered similar to 400 mg bd capsule based on one-sided 80% upper CI above the predefined 20% 
threshold for non-inferiority. Therefore, it was concluded that 200 mg bd tablet was inferior to 400 mg bd 
capsule. 
Next  to  the  initial  PK  phase,  the  study  comprised  successive  phases  (continued  supply  expansion, 
dose-escalation  and  two  final  randomised  expansion)  in  order  to  identify  a  tablet  dose  which  provided 
comparable clinical activity to the 400 mg capsule dose and was well-tolerated.  
The 300 mg bd tablet dose and the 400 mg bd capsule dose resulted in a similar decrease in tumour size with 
a LS mean treatment difference of 1.8% and the one-sided 80% UCL of the difference was less than 15% 
indicating that the 300 mg bd dose had similar efficacy to the 400 mg bd capsule dose. The percentage change 
in tumour size for the 400 mg bd tablet dose was observed to be numerically greater than the 400 mg bd capsule 
dose, however, the tolerability profile was less favourable with higher level of myelotoxicity. Additionally, PK 
data showed that steady state exposure with olaparib tablet dose of 300 mg or higher matched or exceeded that 
of olaparib 400 mg bd capsule. 
Radiological objective response rate at the 300 mg bd and 400 mg bd tablet dose was similar to 400 mg bd 
capsule dose and higher as compared to 200 mg bd tablet dose in ovarian cancer gBRCAm patients.

The incidence of anaemia as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or higher was 
22% at the 300 mg bd tablet dose level and 400 mg bd capsule dose level and 29% at the 400 mg bd tablet dose 
level (Group 6). The incidence of anaemia as CTCAE Grade 3 for the 200 mg bd tablet cohort in Group 1 (n=13) 
was 0%. However the efficacy of the 200 mg bd tablet dose was deemed not equivalent to the 400 mg bd 
capsule dose cohort in the same group (Group 1). 
Overall based on PK, efficacy and safety data from Study 24, the 300 mg bd tablet dose was chosen as the 
recommended dose for the entire olaparib Phase III clinical development programme (over 7 confirmatory 
clinical trials) across multiple tumour type including ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic.

Sample size 
In total 192 events were required to give sufficient precision of the HR. If a HR of 0.2 (similar to the Phase II 
study D0810C00019) was observed, the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) would be 0.15-0.27; if a HR of 0.3 was 
observed the 95% CI would be 0.22-0.40; if a HR of 0.4 was observed the 95% CI would be 0.30-0.54; and if 
a HR of 0.5 was observed the 95% CI would be 0.37-0.67. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was stratified by: 
•  Response to last platinum chemotherapy (CR or PR) 
• 
Time to disease progression in the penultimate platinum based chemotherapy prior to enrolment (>6 to 
≤ 12 months and >12 months) 
Blinding (masking) 
Olaparib and placebo treatment were be blinded.   
Statistical methods 
PFS was analysed using a log-rank test stratified by response to previous platinum chemotherapy (CR or PR), 
and time to disease progression (>6 to 12 months and >12 months) in the penultimate platinum-based 
chemotherapy prior to enrolment and using the Breslow approach for handling ties. The HR and CI was 
estimated from a Cox Proportional Hazards model (with ties = Efron and the stratification variables as 
covariates) and the CI was calculated using a profile likelihood approach. The HR (olaparib vs placebo) together 
with its corresponding 95% CI and p-value was presented (an HR less than 1 represented the reduction in risk 
for those patients allocated olaparib).  Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots of PFS were presented by treatment group.  
Where the observed p-value for treatment difference was <0.025 (1 sided), the result was regarded as 
statistically significant.  As censoring rules in the primary analysis, PFS was defined as the time from 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation  
EMA/228768/2018

randomisation until the date of objective radiological disease progression according to RECIST or death (by any 
cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient discontinues randomised therapy or 
receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression (i.e. date of RECIST progression/death or censoring – 
date of randomisation + 1). Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis, or who progress 
or die after two or more missed visits, are censored at the latest evaluable RECIST assessment, or day 1 if there 
are no evaluable visits. If the patient has no evaluable visits or does not have a baseline assessment they will be 
censored at day 1 unless they die within two visits of baseline (25 weeks allowing for visit window) 
An initial analysis of PFS2 and OS was performed at the same time as the primary analysis of PFS, and the same 
methodology and model was used.  As PFS2 reached statistical significance at the interim analyses, a further 
analysis of OS will be performed when the OS data are approximately 60% mature (177 OS events); this is 
anticipated to occur approximately 72 months (6 years) after the first patient was enrolled.  A further analysis 
of PFS2 was to be performed at the time of the OS analysis if PFS2 was not statistically significant at the primary 
PFS analysis.   
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 602 subjects who enrolled for this study, 295 were randomized to receive maintenance treatment: 196 
were allocated to olaparib and 99 to placebo.  
The data cut-off for the primary analysis of PFS presented in this CSR (19 September 2016) took place when 187 
progression events had occurred (~63.4% maturity), approximately 36 months after the first patient was 
enrolled.  At this DCO, all efficacy, QoL and safety variables were analysed, as appropriate, based on the amount 
of data available at that time.  The bioanalytical DCO was 27 May 2015 for PK samples received and all PK data 
were analysed, as appropriate.

Conduct of the study 
Almost half of the patients enrolled in the study were not randomized, mainly because of the unfilled selection 
criteria (293 / 307 patients not randomised). 
A notable number of patients in both olaparib (46 out of 195) and placebo (40 out of 99) groups were unblinded 
at the time of primary PFS analysis. The reason of unblinding of the patient was to determine the optimal 
subsequent therapy. 
At the time of data cut-off for the analysis (19 September 2016), 96 patients were ongoing in the study 
(32.7%): 83 (42.6%) patients and 13 (13.1%) patients in the Olaparib arm and placebo arm, respectively. 
A greater number of patients discontinued study treatment in the placebo group than in the olaparib group 
(86.9% versus 57.4%).  However, more patients in olaparib arm stopped their treatment due to AEs than in the 
placebo arm (11.3% versus 2.0%).

Key deviations before the start of treatment and during treatment. 
A patient had a deleterious gBRCA mutation identified using the Myriad CLIA test but was classified as gBRCAwt by the Myriad CDx test 
due to a technical issue.  A patient was reported as gBRCAwt by both Myriad tests but reported as carrying a suspected deleterious 
mutation by local testing; subsequently, the local test has been confirmed as reporting a gBRCA VUS variant. 
Note that the same patient may have had more than 1 key protocol deviation. 
15.6% of patients had a protocol deviation, of which 17.3% were in olaparib arm and 12.1% in placebo arm. The 
most common key deviations were related to pre-treatment CA-125 levels. Key protocol deviations were 
generally balanced between the treatment groups.

One of the patients in the placebo group received olaparib as a subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer but was erroneously reported as 
receiving post-progression olaparib for breast cancer. 
When considering only the patients who had disease progression, in both treatment groups, the majority of 
patients received a subsequent anticancer therapy (89/106 [84.0%] olaparib-treated patients vs 77/80 
[96.3%] placebo-treated patients). A total of 31.6% [62/196] and 34.3% [34/99] of patients in the olaparib and 
placebo groups received a platinum containing regimen as a subsequent therapy and other chemotherapies 
(excluding platinum or bevacizumab) was received by 21.9% [43/196] and 40.4% [40/99] of patients in the 
olaparib and placebo groups, respectively (a platinum followed by olaparib maintenance was classified as a PARP 
regimen, even though it contained platinum).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: PFS 
The PFS analysis was conducted using data cut-off on 19 September 2016. 
PFS investigator-assessed was statistically significant longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group 
((HR: 0.30; 95%CI 0.22-0.41; p<0.0001; median 19.1 vs 5.5 months).  Analysis of PFS by BICR confirmed the 
robustness of the primary PFS result (HR: 0.25; 95% CI 0.18-0.35; p<0.0001).

Secondary endpoints 
Overall survival 
At interim OS analysis (24% maturity), the results showed a non-statistically significant numerical advantage 
overall survival; the HR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.50-1.31; p=0.4267). Median OS was not reached in either 
treatment group.

Analyses of the intermediate clinical endpoints of TDT, TFST and TSST, each demonstrated a nominally 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of discontinuation of study treatment or 
death, delays in time until the first and the second subsequent therapies or death, respectively, in 
olaparib-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. 
PFS2 met statistical significance (HR:0.50; 95% CI 0.34-0.72; p=0.0002; median not reached vs 18.4 months).

Study 19 (capsule formulation) 
This study was a Phase II, randomised, double blind, multicentre placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy 
of olaparib (capsule formulation) in the treatment of patients with platinum-sensitive (defined clinically as 
progression >6 months after previous platinum-based therapy) relapsed high-grade serous ovarian cancer, who 
had received ≥2 previous platinum regimens and were in partial response or complete response following their 
last platinum-containing regimen.

Treatments 
Patients were administered olaparib or matching placebo (capsule formulation) orally at 400 mg bd, continually 
throughout a 28 day cycle. Eight 50 mg olaparib or matching placebo capsules were to be taken at the same 
times each day, with approximately 240 mL of water. 
Patients continued taking olaparib or matching placebo capsules until objective disease progression (determined 
by RECIST) provided that, in the Investigator’s opinion, they were benefiting from treatment and they did not 
meet any other discontinuation criteria.

Sample size 
The study was planned on the basis that there would be 2 co-primary analysis populations: the first comprising 
all patients, the second comprising a subset of patients defined to be HRD. 
However, the HRD status of patients could not be established at present due to the lack of diagnostic test to 
identify patients with HRD tumours. The analysis of efficacy in the HRD sub-population formed an exploratory 
objective of the study.  
The following information refers to the HRD population in order to provide a clear understanding of the original 
sample size calculation. 
The primary analysis was to be performed when a total of 137 PFS events had been observed in the overall 
population: this was reported in full in the CSR dated 26 July 2011 with 153 progression events. If the true HR 
was 0.75 (likely to correspond to a 33% increase in median PFS from 9 to 12 months) and the overall type I error 
rate was 20% (1-sided), there would be approximately 80% power to demonstrate a promising difference in 
favour of olaparib (ie, p<0.2, 1-sided). 
The second co-primary analysis, in the HRD population, was to be performed at the time of the first co-primary 
analysis. If the true HR was equal to 0.62 (likely to correspond to a 61% increase in median PFS from 9 to 14 
months) and the overall type I error rate was 20% (1-sided), there was approximately 80% power to 
demonstrate a promising difference in favour of olaparib (p<0.2, 1-sided) in the HRD group when 50 events 
were expected to have occurred.

The calculation for the overall population assumed that the HR for the non-HRD group was 0.9. Statistical 
significance at conventional levels, in favour of olaparib, was to be declared in the overall population for PFS if 
the observed p-value was <0.025 (1-sided). 
It was prospectively defined to perform an initial analysis of OS at the time of the PFS DCO only if there were 
sufficient events (at least 20) to make it meaningful, with a final analysis of OS at a later point with more mature 
data. Statistical significance, in favour of olaparib, was to be declared in the overall population for OS if the 
observed p-value at the first OS analysis was <0.0125 (1-sided). The corresponding level of significance at the 
second OS analysis was to be calculated at the time of analysis. The overall Type I error rate for OS was to be 
controlled at the 2.5% level (1-sided) by accounting for the correlation between the 2 analyses. 
It was intended that a total of 250 patients (125 patients in the olaparib group and 125 in the placebo group) 
would be randomised to the study. Assuming an HRD prevalence of 50% and a 25% attrition of samples, 94 
patients would be included in the HRD group. If patients were recruited over 15 months according to a non-linear 
cumulative recruitment function of (t/15)2, and if the median PFS for the placebo group was 9 months, it was 
predicted that 137 PFS events overall (50 in the HRD group) would occur at 23 months after the first patient had 
entered the study. 
•  Data and safety monitoring board 
An external IDMC was appointed to review key safety parameters when 100 patients had completed 2 cycles of 
treatment. The recommendation of the IDMC following this review was that the study should proceed 
unchanged. 
Randomisation 
Patients were to be randomised within 8 weeks after their last dose of the platinum containing regimen in a 1:1 
ratio to one of 2 arms: 
1.  olaparib 400 mg bd 
2.  olaparib matching placebo bd 
The randomisation scheme was stratified based on: 
1.  The time to disease progression from the completion of the penultimate platinum-containing therapy 
(last dose) prior to enrolment on the study(>6 to ≤12 months and >12 months). 
2.  Objective response to the last platinum-containing regimen prior to enrolment on the study (CR (defined 
as normal radiological findings and CA-125 within the normal range)/PR (defined as a RECIST PR and/or 
GCIG CA-125 response) 
3.  The ethnic descent of the patient (Jewish/Non Jewish) 
Crossover to olaparib was not permitted within the design of the study, but patients were able to access PARP 
inhibitors outside of the study, and subsequent PARP inhibitor use was documented.

Blinding (masking) 
Olaparib and placebo matched olaparib treatments were blinded. The active and placebo capsules were identical 
and presented in the same packaging to ensure blinding of the study medication.  
Patients were not to be unblinded prior to the final PFS analysis, unless knowledge of the treatment assignment 
was necessary for the management of medical emergencies, or the patient was considered for enrolment into a 
study in which prior PARP therapy was not allowed. 
Statistical methods 
The study tested the hypothesis that olaparib 400 mg bd, given as maintenance therapy after a stable 
maintained objective response obtained upon completion of platinum-containing therapy, improves progression 
free survival (PFS) compared with placebo. 
PFS was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for the following factors (using 
source-verified CRF data); ethnic descent, platinum sensitivity and response to final platinum therapy.  All 
efficacy analyses were adjusted according to the true levels of the covariates, regardless of the levels declared 
at randomisation in the IVRS.  The primary analysis of PFS did not censor patients who started subsequent 
therapy prior to progression.  The effect of treatment was estimated by the adjusted HR together with its 
corresponding 80% and 95% CIs calculated using the profile likelihood approach.  KM plots of PFS were 
presented by treatment group.  If the observed p-value for the treatment difference was <0.025 (1 sided) then 
the result was regarded as statistically significant.   
The analysis of OS used the same methodology and model as described for the primary analysis.  Multiplicity 
adjustment for OS was pre-specified in the Study 19 CSP.  Due to the interim analyses that were performed 
during the study, in order to declare statistical significance at the final OS analysis the observed p-value would 
need to have been <0.0095 (two-sided).   
Interim Analysis 
It was initially planned that the IDMC would conduct a single interim analysis of PFS when approximately 80 PFS 
events had occurred. The objective of this interim analysis was to determine whether there was sufficient 
efficacy to trigger a Phase III study in the overall population as per the IDMC charter. There was no intention to 
stop the study early on the basis of good efficacy results from the interim analysis. However, from emerging 
information in the ongoing olaparib programme, AstraZeneca determined in February 2010 that the interim 
analysis was not required to trigger Phase III studies and the interim analysis was not to be performed. 
As only 1 analysis of PFS took place no adjustments were required to control the Type I error. 
Consideration was to be given to formally analysing OS twice, depending on sufficient numbers of death events 
at the time of the primary analysis of PFS. If this was the case, the overall type I error for the OS analyses would 
be controlled at the 2.5% level (1-sided) by accounting for the correlation between the analyses. As part of CSP 
amendments, the AstraZeneca clinical project team added an interim analysis of OS, to be performed when 
there were approximately 100 deaths (~40% maturity) and then the final OS analysis was to be performed at 
approximately 85% maturity (~222 deaths).

Final analysis 
The CSR addendum 3 presents descriptive results from the final analysis of OS at a DCO of 09 May 2016.  Whilst 
p-values have been calculated, these are considered nominal only, with the multiple testing strategy only 
pre-specified for OS in the overall study population and not in the BRCA subgroup analyses. 
Control of type I error for the exploratory endpoints of time to discontinuation of treatment or death (TDT), time 
to first subsequent therapy or death (TFST) and time to second subsequent therapy or death (TSST) were not 
defined in this Phase II study.  Where p-values <0.05 are observed for these endpoints (meeting nominal 
significance), statistical significance is stated since they are interpreted in the context of a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS. 
Multiplicity adjustment for OS was pre-specified in the Clinical Study Protocol.  The testing strategy states that 
statistical significance, for OS in favour of olaparib, will be declared in the overall study population if the 
observed p-value is <0.001 (2-sided) at the first interim analysis, <0.03 (2-sided) at the second analysis with 
each subsequent analysis testing at half of the remaining alpha, unless it is the final analysis where all the 
remaining alpha will be spent.  This allows the overall alpha to be controlled at 5% (2-sided). 
This is the fourth and final analysis. The p-value required to declare statistical significance in the overall 
population is detailed below.

Determination of BRCA status 
BRCA mutation testing was not mandatory for patients to participate in the study. However, BRCA mutation 
status data were obtained by three routes, as summarised below. Each route involved determination of gene 
sequence variants present within a patient’s sample and classification of the sequence variant as to whether it 
could be regarded as causal of an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer when inherited. 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation  
EMA/228768/2018 
Page 91/163 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Route (i) for patients with pre-existing BRCA test results, the sequence variants (as determined on a blood 
sample) and local testing laboratory classification were captured in CRFs. This was pre-specified in the CSP. 
Route (ii) blood samples from patients who consented to the optional genetic analysis were analysed and 
classified at Myriad in March 2012. This was retrospectively performed. 
Route (iii) archival tumour samples in patients who consented to genetic analysis were analysed at Foundation 
Medicine for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2: the sequence variants were classified, by AstraZeneca Personnel, 
using the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database on 6 December and 7 December 2012. This was 
retrospectively performed. 
The MAH combined available data for germline BRCA mutation status and tumour BRCA mutation status 
provided from the various sources and re-classified the data into the categories listed below to define the 
subgroups for analysis. Data obtained via the CRF did not provide information on BRCA mutations variants of 
unknown significance (VUS) so no CRF data were reported for the “BRCA Unknown” category. 
1. BRCA mutated 
- 
- 
patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation identified via germline testing (by Myriad 
and/or local test), or 
patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation identified in the tumour. 
2. BRCA wildtype/BRCA unknown (variant of unknown significance; VUS): patients who were not BRCA mutated 
as defined above and at least one of the following: 
-  Germline data from Myriad indicated a genetic variant of unknown significance, or 
- 
- 
- 
patients who have undergone complete Myriad germline BRCA testing but with no deleterious or 
suspected deleterious mutation documented, or 
patients who have previously undergone testing at a local site and have no deleterious or suspected 
deleterious mutation documented, or 
tumour data showed either a BRCA variant of unknown significance or wild type. 
3. BRCA missing 
- 
- 
patients who were not classified as BRCA mutated, BRCA wildtype/BRCA unknown (VUS) as defined 
above, and 
patients either did not have complete Myriad BRCA test reported and did not have BRCA result recorded 
from tumour analysis or a BRCA result recorded in the CRF.

Results 
Participant flow 
At the time of data cut-off for the final analysis (09 May 2016), 39 patients were ongoing in the study, of which 
14 are still being treated by Olaparib and one by placebo. 
The data cut-off (DCO) for the primary analysis was 30 June 2010 and the original CSR for the primary analysis 
was dated 26 July 2011. The CSR was revised to present data for the subpopulation of patients with breast 
cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation detected in blood (germline) and/or tumour samples as well as the 
overall population; this CSR was based on a DCO of 26 November 2012, and included interim overall survival 
(OS) analysis at 58% maturity; the CSR was dated 31 July 2013 and replaced the original CSR. Following the 
completion of this CSR, a number of data corrections were made and a CSR erratum was issued dated 
27 September 2013.  Subsequent to this, an addendum dated 25 November 2013, which was also based on the 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation

DCO of 26 November 2012, presented results from a subgroup analysis based on classification of the patient 
population by the germline Myriad Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) accredited Integrated 
BRACAnalysis test. 
An interim OS addendum was produced on 16 May 2016 at 77% data maturity, based on a DCO of 30 September 
2015 and the addendum was issued. The current final addendum presents descriptive results from the final 
analysis of OS at 79% maturity with a DCO of 09 May 2016.

•  BRCA mutation status 
When the assessment of tBRCA mutation status was combined with the assessment of gBRCA mutation status, 
the BRCA mutation status was known for 254/265 patients (96% of the study population).

**BRCAwt: or uncertain significance dataset: defined as wild type or variant of uncertain significance by either germline or tumour (and not 
BRCAm) (total n=118). 
Knowledge of gBRCA mutation status was documented in 98/265 patients (37% of the study population); based 
on local laboratory testing.  The tumour and/or gBRCA mutation status of all patients who had provided tumour 
and blood samples (prior to randomisation) with appropriate consent was determined, for germline BRCA 
mutations, using the Myriad Genetic Laboratories Inc diagnostic assay (Integrated BRACAnalysis) and by 
Foundation Medicine testing for tumour BRCA mutations.  This resulted in the BRCAm status being known in 
254/265 patients (96% of the study population) and the gBRCA mutation status being known for 210/265 
patients (79% of the study population).  In total, 136 patients had a BRCA mutation (either germline and/or 
tumour) and 118 were BRCAwt/VUS. 
Overall, of the patients with a BRCA mutation, 68% of patients had a mutation in BRCA1 and 32% of patients 
had a mutation in BRCA2.  These proportions are consistent with published literature (Alsop et al 2012a and 
Alsop et al 2012b).

The majority of patients in each treatment group were randomised to study treatment ≤8 weeks after 
completing their last platinum-containing therapy. Eight patients were not randomised within 8 weeks of 
completion of platinum (4 were randomised within 9 weeks). 
Patients were randomised into the study a median of 40 days after completing their final platinum 
chemotherapy. They received an average of 3 previous chemotherapy regimens (range 2-11) and 2.6 previous 
platinum-containing chemotherapies (range 2-8).

•  Subsequent therapies 
There was a high prevalence of subsequent therapy use following randomised treatment. Although crossover to 
olaparib was not permitted within the design of the study, patients were able to access PARP inhibitors outside 
of the study, through other clinical studies.  Subsequent therapy use was reported by the investigators for 
patients ongoing in the study and so subsequent PARP inhibitor use was documented.  
Of the 130 patients in the olaparib group of the FAS eligible to receive subsequent therapy (defined as having 
discontinued treatment without immediately terminating from the study [including death]), 91 (70%) received

≥1 subsequent therapy and 22 (17%) received ≥5 subsequent therapies. None went on to receive a PARP 
inhibitor 
Of the 126 patients in the placebo group of the FAS eligible to receive subsequent therapy, 111 (88%) received 
≥1 subsequent therapy and 24 (19%) received ≥5 subsequent therapies.  Seventeen (14%) of these patients 
are known to have gone on to receive a PARP inhibitor (Table 11.2.6.6.1).  No additional patients have received 
a PARP inhibitor since the 30 September 2015 DCO (1 additional patient had received a PARP inhibitor between 
the 26 November 2012 and 30 September 2015 DCOs). 
Compared with the FAS, in the BRCA mutated subgroups the percentage of patients who received placebo and 
went on to receive a PARP inhibitor was higher: 14/61 (23%) patients in the BRCA mutated subgroup, 
13/42 (31% patients in the gBRCA mutated subgroup, and 6/27 (22%) Myriad CLIA gBRCA mutated subgroup.

Numbers analysed 
The analysis sets and the number of patients in each analysis set are summarised in Table below. 
Table 29: Summary of analysis sets: All patients 
a All randomised patients analysed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis. 
b All patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
c Three patients received the incorrect study treatment for a short period due to a dispensing error. Patient E1002007 (olaparib group) received 
1 bottle of placebo between Cycle 3 and Cycle 4 resulting in an olaparib dose interruption of approximately 1 week. No new AEs were reported 
for this patient between the Cycle 3 and Cycle 4. Patient E1810002 (olaparib group) received 2 bottles of placebo between Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 
resulting in an olaparib dose interruption of approximately 2 weeks. Between Cycle 2 and Cycle 3, the patient had an SAE of Grade 3 syncope 
(Day 48) whilst potentially receiving placebo. This AE was counted in the olaparib safety analysis set. Patient E1810001 (placebo group) received 
2 bottles of olaparib between Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 and, therefore, took the equivalent of olaparib 400 mg bd for approximately 2 weeks. Between 
Cycle 2 and Cycle 3, the patient had a non-serious AE of CTCAE Grade 3 fatigue (Day 56) while potentially receiving olaparib. This AE was 
counted in the placebo safety analysis set but the possibility that it was attributable to olaparib cannot be excluded. 
d One patient (Patient E1805004) was randomised to the placebo group but voluntarily withdrew her consent (and completely withdrew from the 
study) without receiving treatment. 
e A subset of the full analysis set which includes patients with measurable disease at baseline. 
f A subset of the full analysis set which includes patients evaluable for CA-125 response at baseline (CA-125 levels below the 2X ULN threshold 
at baseline). 
g A subset of the full analysis set which includes patients who have Evaluable HRQL/Symptom Endpoints at baseline. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary variable: Progression free survival in the overall study population 
The primary endpoint PFS was only analysed at the initial DCO (June 2010) and RECIST scans were not collected 
beyond this time point.

The analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model with factors for treatment (olaparib vs. 
placebo), time to disease progression (>6-12 months and >12 months, in the penultimate platinum therapy 
prior to enrolment), objective response (CR or PR, in the last platinum therapy prior to enrolment), and Jewish 
descent (yes or no).

In the original analysis, the primary variable of 
PFS was derived based on investigator 
assessments recorded on the CRFs. The study 
protocol required radiological examinations to 
be retained at the study sites in order to allow 
a blinded independent central review if 
required. 
A retrospective blinded independent central 
review of scans was performed as a sensitivity

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted an extension application to the current marketing authorisation to register the tablet 
formulation of olaparib (300 mg orally bd, tablets containing 150 mg, 4 tablets per day starting dose and 100mg 
strength to be used for dose reductions) which will progressively replace the capsule formulation (400 mg orally 
bd, capsules containing 50 mg of olaparib, 16 capsules per day).

The indication for capsule formulation remains the same, while indication for tablet formulation is as 
monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive relapsed (PSR) high-grade 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or partial 
response) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The Phase III study ‘SOLO2’ and the updated analysis of the Phase II study ‘Study 19’ have been submitted to 
support this extension application. Given that only patients with germline BRCA mutations have been included 
in the pivotal Phase III SOLO-2 study with tablet formulation, the updated results of the Phase II Study 19 
conducted with capsule formulation were provided to support an enlarged indication regardless of BRCA1/2 
status.  
The proposed indication also refers to high-grade ovarian cancer. The study population for SOLO2 was patients 
with PSR high-grade serous or high-grade endometrioid ovarian cancer, while for Study 19 the study population 
was patients with PSR high grade serous ovarian cancer. 
Recent evidence suggests that serous and endometrioid carcinomas arise from the tubal fimbrae, suggesting 
similar biology and origin for the high grade epithelial histologies (Jayson et al 2014). Pennington et al reported 
in their study that contrary to the common belief of homologous recombination deficiencies being characteristic 
of high-grade serous ovarian cancer only, DNA repair deficiencies were found equally commonly in carcinomas 
with non-serous histology (Pennington et al 2014). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Besides differences in the pharmaceutical formulation and the study population (selected vs unselected 
patients), SOLO2 and Study 19 were designed to be fundamentally alike in terms of outcome measures, conduct 
and geographical spread of patients.  
The pivotal study SOLO2 of this application was a Phase III randomised, double-blind study of maintenance 
therapy with olaparib or placebo in platinum sensitive relapsed BRCA mutated ovarian cancer patients who are 
in complete or partial response following platinum containing chemotherapy. This study already started at the 
time of the initial marketing authorization approval of olaparib in both germline and somatic BRCAm patients in 
order to provide confirmatory efficacy and safety data. All patients were documented to have a 
deleterious/suspected deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation prior to randomisation. Eligibility for 
randomisation was based on either local testing (germline or tumour) or Myriad CLIA testing.  All patients were 
also subsequently tested using the Myriad CDx. Prior to receiving maintenance therapy, patients were required 
to have received at least 2 previous lines of platinum-containing therapy and completed their 
platinum-containing regimen as per normal clinical practice prior to enrolment, with a minimum of 4 cycles 
required.  Patients could have received bevacizumab in conjunction with the penultimate but not during the 
chemotherapy course immediately prior to randomisation. Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to received 
olaparib or placebo as maintenance therapy at a dose of 300 mg twice daily. The treatment was provided until 
progression. Two tablet strengths were available in order to manage dose reductions: tablet of 150 mg and 100 
mg.  
Study 19 conducted with the capsule form of Lynparza (400mg bd), was a Phase II, randomised, double-blind, 
multicentre placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of olaparib (capsule formulation) in the treatment of 
patients with platinum-sensitive (defined clinically as progression >6 months after previous platinum-based

therapy) relapsed high-grade serous ovarian cancer, who had received ≥2 previous platinum regimens and 
were in partial response or complete response following their last platinum-containing regimen. The population 
is solely targeted on patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer whereas the proposed indication is 
extended to high grade ovarian cancer (deletion of “serous”). The study was performed in platinum-sensitive 
serous ovarian cancer patients who had received 2 or more previous platinum-containing regimens. The Study 
19 protocol did not require the 2 prior platinum regimens determining eligibility to be sequential (eg, patients 
could have received a non-platinum regimen between the penultimate and the last platinum chemotherapy).  
Patients included in Study 19 were not selected for the presence of a BRCA mutation. Patients were administered 
olaparib or matching placebo (capsule formulation) orally at 400 mg bd, continually throughout a 28 day cycle.  
Both trials were a placebo-controlled study. At the time these studies were commenced, there was no 
therapeutic option approved for the maintenance treatment of ovarian cancer after a response following a 
platinum-based chemotherapy. Therefore, the use of placebo as comparator was considered to be appropriate 
in order to determine the efficacy of olaparib as maintenance treatment of ovarian cancer after a response to 
platinum-containing regimens. In the study ‘SOLO2’ eligible patients must have a BRCA mutation.  
In study 19, knowledge of the BRCA mutation status was not a requirement for entry but was documented at 
study entry in approximately one third of the study population based on local laboratory testing. Following this, 
retrospective BRCA mutation status testing was performed by Myriad Genetic Laboratories Inc using diagnostic 
assay ‘Integrated BRACAnalysis’ for germline BRCA mutations and by Foundation Medicine for tumour BRCA 
mutations. This resulted in the BRCA mutation status being known in 254 out of 265 patients (96% of the study 
population) and of which 136 patients had a BRCA mutation (either germline and/or tumour) and 118 were 
BRCAwt/VUS. 
In  both  SOLO2  and  Study  19,  randomisation  was  stratified  by  response  and  sensitivity  to  platinum 
chemotherapy. In Study 19, ethnic descent of the patient was an additional stratification factor. However, a 
more  global  stratification  based  on  the  BRCA  mutation  in  the  overall  population  would  have  been  more 
appropriate. The method for the random assignment of subjects to treatment groups in SOLO2 has not been 
reported.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses  
Dose-response studies  
The selection of the Phase III olaparib tablet dose/regimen of 300 mg bd (as two 150 mg tablets two times per 
day [total daily dose 600 mg]) was based on data from the completed Phase I bioavailability study, Study 24. 
In this study, higher exposures of olaparib were observed with the tablet formulation compared with the capsule 
formulation. However, based on data from PK/PD modelling it could not be concluded that higher exposure 
would result in higher efficacy.  Based on the totality of data and intra-study comparability of PK, efficacy and 
safety data of Study 24, the tablet dose/schedule of 300 mg bd was considered to meet pre-defined efficacy 
criteria, demonstrating a similar magnitude of tumour shrinkage to the 400 mg bd capsule with a similar 
tolerability profile. Therefore, the proposed dose with the tablet formulation of 300 mg bd was considered 
acceptable.

Pivotal studies 
In SOLO2, the efficacy endpoints and their priority were in line with recommendations from EMA ‘Guideline on 
the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man’ EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.5). The use of PFS as primary 
endpoint for maintenance therapy in ovarian cancer is supported if being statistically compelling with no 
detrimental effect on OS. In addition, secondary objectives are of interest in a maintenance setting and repeated 
platinum-based treatment in ovarian cancer patients (PFS2, TFST, TSST and TDT). 
PFS assessment was initially by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to modified RECIST 1.1 
criteria. Per protocol amendment 3 (issued April 2016) a change in the assessment of primary endpoint PFS from 
BICR to investigator assessment, with BICR assessment retained as a sensitivity analysis, was implemented. 
Although assessment by investigator might introduce bias, robustness of PFS assessment is ensured by the 
double-blind design and well balanced timing of radiologic assessments between treatment groups and 
minimisation of unscheduled radiological assessments. The change in the assessment of primary endpoint PFS 
from BICR to investigator assessment is acceptable.  
FAS on an ITT basis was the main set used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints. Adjustments were made for 
multiplicity introduced by analysing multiple endpoints (excluding TDT, TFST and TSST). A hierarchical testing 
strategy was employed where PFS was tested first using the full test mass (full test mass = alpha) and key 
secondary endpoints of PFS2 and OS were then tested using a multiple testing procedure (MTP) with a recycling 
strategy (ie, the MTP will recycle the test mass to the endpoint not yet rejected in the hierarchy). PFS2 (with the 
test mass split between interim and final PFS2 analyses) was tested at the time of the primary analyses of PFS 
because statistical significance was shown for PFS. At the interim analysis PFS2 was statistically significant, and 
so the full test mass (alpha) was carried forward to OS. 
In Study 19, PFS by investigator assessment of scans according to RECIST 1.0 was the primary efficacy 
endpoint. Retrospective blinded independent central review of scans was performed as a sensitivity analysis to 
confirm the robustness of the original primary PFS analysis. OS, BoR (RECIST), ORR, DCR, DoR, change in 
tumour size, CA-125 response, time to progression by CA 125 or RECIST, and HRQoL were secondary efficacy 
endpoints. TDT, TFST and TSST were exploratory endpoints analysed retrospectively. 
•  Study SOLO2 
In the pivotal study SOLO2, a total of 295 patients out of the 602 patients enrolled were randomly assigned to 
either the olaparib arm (196 patients) or matching placebo arm (99 patients). All except one olaparib patient 
(195) and all placebo patients (99) received study treatment.  
At the time of the DCO, a total of 83 patients (43 and 40 patients in the olaparib and placebo groups, 
respectively) were un-blinded to randomised study treatment on the IVRS. Of the 43 patients unblinded to 
treatment in the olaparib group, 3 patients were unblinded prior to investigator-assessed modified RECIST 1.1 
progression. Of the 40 patients un-blinded to treatment in the placebo group, 2 patients were un-blinded prior 
to investigator-assessed modified RECIST 1.1 progression. No cross over was planned in the protocol. However 
unblinding of patients could for example, occur in order to determine if olaparib or another PARP inhibitor may 
be administered as subsequent therapy.    
In the overall population of SOLO2 study, demographic and baseline characteristics were generally well 
balanced between treatment groups.  
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation  
EMA/228768/2018 
Page 120/163 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the olaparib and placebo arms. 
Median age was 56 years in both arms. Ovarian cancer was the primary tumour in > 80% of the patients. The 
most common histological type was serous (> 90%), endometrioid histology was reported in 6% of the patients. 
In the olaparib arm 55% of the patients had only 2 prior lines of treatment with 45% receiving 3 or more prior 
lines of treatment. In the placebo arm 61% of patients had received only 2 prior lines with 39% receiving 3 or 
more prior lines of treatment. Most patients were ECOG performance status 0 (81%). Platinum free interval was 
> 12 months in 60% and > 6-12 months in 40% of the patients. Response to prior platinum chemotherapy was 
complete in 47% and partial in 53% of the patients. In the olaparib and placebo arms, 17% and 20% of patients 
had prior bevacizumab, respectively. 
In the FAS, 6 patients were identified as having a germline BRCA mutation by local testing in whom Myriad 
testing did not confirm a germline BRCA mutation. Furthermore, no patient with somatic BRCA1/2 mutation has 
been enrolled. For the 5 patients (among 295) randomized with a known somatic BRCA mutation, a gBRCA 
mutation was subsequently confirmed by the Myriad CLIA Integrated BRAC analysis test. 
The study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in investigator 
assessed PFS for olaparib compared with placebo with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.30 (95% CI 0.22 0.41; 
p<0.0001; median 19.1 months olaparib vs 5.5 months placebo). The investigator assessment of PFS was 
supported with a blinded independent central radiological review of PFS (HR 0.25; 95% CI 0.18 0.35; p<0.0001; 
median 30.2 months for olaparib and 5.5 months placebo). At 2 years, 43% olaparib treated patients remained 
progression free compared with only 15% placebo treated patients. 
Overall, all analyses of PFS, including sensitivities (eg, evaluation time bias, attrition bias and deviation bias) 
demonstrated a consistent and favourable treatment benefit for olaparib in maintenance therapy for high grade 
serous ovarian cancer with germline BRCA mutation. 
Among the patients entering the trial with measurable disease (target lesions at baseline), an objective 
response rate of 41% was achieved in the Lynparza arm versus 17% on placebo. Of patients treated with 
Lynparza, who entered the study with evidence of disease (target or non target lesions at baseline), 15.0% 
experienced complete response compared with 9.1% of patients on placebo. 
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data indicate no difference for the olaparib-treated patients as compared to 
placebo as assessed by the change from baseline in the Trial Outcome Index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment 
of Cancer Therapy – Ovarian (FACT O). 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analysis of PFS across various particular subgroups did not reveal an obvious differential benefit 
across pre-defined subgroups compared with the overall population. The benefit of olaparib over placebo was 
maintained across all pre-defined subgroups, with different magnitude. 
An assessment of PFS and OS (DCO 19 September 2016) in patients by gBRCA1m versus gBRCA2m status was 
performed. The results indicated that the treatment effect in patients with gBRCA1 mutation as well as with 
gBRCA2 mutation was consistent with that seen in the FAS population.  
The results of the exploratory analysis of OS by gBRCA1m and gBRCA2m status suggest a potential differential 
survival benefit between gBRCA1 mutated patients and gBRCA2 mutated patients, with patients with gBRCA2

mutations appearing to benefit more. Further analyses and additional data from new studies may be more 
informative in this regard.  A final OS analysis for SOLO2, scheduled to take place at ~60% maturity, is expected 
to provide more informative data on any differences in OS by BRCA1m and BRCA2m status as well as the rest

The results of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) testing (using Myriad myChoice HRD scores) are now 
available and a preliminary review has been provided (see PD part). A full manuscript is currently in preparation 
and the MAH is recommended to submit it by 1Q2018. 
•  Study 19 
Of the 265 patients randomised into the study, all patients randomised to olaparib (n=136) and 128 of the 129 
patients randomised to placebo received study treatment. Of the 264 patients who received study treatment, 
136 patients were classified as having a BRCA mutation (either germline and/or tumour; 74 received olaparib 
and 62 received placebo) and 118 patients were BRCAwt/VUS (57 received olaparib and 61 received placebo). 
At the final DCO (09 May 2016) 39 patients were still in the study; of these, 14 were still receiving olaparib 
treatment (7 patients with BRCAm and 7 with BRCAwt/VUS) and 1 was still receiving placebo (BRCAm). 
Of the 265 patients who enrolled for study 19, 62 (23.4%) were unblinded during the course of the study: 19 
(14%) patients and 43 (33.3%) patients in the olaparib arm and placebo arm, respectively. The rate of patients 
unblinded prior progression is high (9.8%) but it is difficult to draw conclusions as the reasons for unblinding 
were not collected.   
Study 19 data are presented according to the BRCA mutation status (BRCAm vs BRCAwt/VUS) whereas this 
stratification criterion was not initially pre-planned.  
In the overall population of study 19, demographic and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced 
between treatment groups. The majority of patients were White (>94% in each arm), and no Jewish descent 
(>77%  in  each  arm).  The  age  distribution  of  the  BRCA  population  was  a  little  younger  than  the  non-BRCA 
population,  and  consequently  than  the  overall  population  (age  <50  years:  25.7%  versus  9.3%  and  18.9%, 
BRCAm versus non-BRCAm and FAS, respectively). 
Like in SOLO2 study, there was a slight imbalance between groups in the number of patients with ECOG PS 0 and 
1, with mainly patients with an  ECOG PS of 1  whatever the subgroup, and most patients had their primary 
tumour in the ovary, and it is stated in the study 19 that had in majority a poorly differentiated G3 tumour. 
More than half of the patients had a >12 months progression-free interval since the penultimate platinum based 
chemotherapy, platinum free interval of more than 12 months and had a PR to the last chemotherapy regimen 
in the Study 19. Further, patients in this could have another treatment than platinum-containing therapy before 
the most recent platinum-containing treatment.  
Due to the fact that study 19 protocol did not require the 2 prior platinum regimens determining eligibility to be 
sequential,  the  median  number  of  prior  platinum  regimens  was  lower  than  the  median  number  of  prior 
chemotherapy  regimens.  Indeed,  patients  in  each  treatment  group  had  received  a  median  of  3  previous 
chemotherapy regimens (range: 2 to 11, and 2 to 8 regimens for olaparib and placebo, respectively) and a 
median of 2 prior platinum containing chemotherapies (range: 2 to 7, and 2 to 8 platinum-containing regimens 
for both olaparib and placebo respectively).

Study  19  patients  received  more  treatment  lines  than  SOLO2  study  patients  (median  of  3  vs  2  previous 
chemotherapy regimens respectively).  
The SmPC of the capsule formulation has been updated to reflect the analysis of the data of the mutated BRCA 
sub-group. 
Retrospective analyses of samples have been conducted by the MAH. The mutational status of BRCA was known 
for 254 out of 265 patients. In total, 136 patients had a BRCA1/2 mutation (either germline and/or tumour), 
including 71 being mutated in both the germline and tumour. Of these 136 patients, 96 had a germline mutation 
of which 65 were determined by Myriad CLIA gBRCA test. The Applicant provided some explanations for 
discrepancies between germline and tumour status when only one of them was mutated.  
In addition, 118 patients were defined as BRCAwt/variant of unknown significance. The pooling of these two 
subpopulations is questionable, even if out of these 118 patients defined as BRCA wild type or VUS, only 12 were 
defined by a BRCA mutation status unknown/VUS by either germline or tumour. 
The PFS analysis was conducted using data cut-off on 30 June 2010. These data supported the initial marketing 
authorization for the capsule formulation, based on PFS results in the BRCA1/2 mutated population. In this 
application, the FAS efficacy data are supportive of the broad indication claimed by the MAH and long-term 
efficacy outcomes have been provided to support the initially observed PFS benefit in FAS population and in 
subgroups.  
Study 19 met its primary objective of statistically significantly improved investigator-assessed PFS (by RECIST) 
in the overall population treated with olaparib compared with placebo (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.25-0.49; p<0.00001; 
median 8.4 vs 4.8 months), which was confirmed by a blinded independent central radiological review (HR 0.39; 
95% CI: 0.28, 0.56; p<0.00001). 
As initially assessed, the main benefit in the mutated BRCA population was a prolongation of median PFS from 
4.3 to 11.2 months (HR 0.18; CI 0.10-0.31, p<0.00001). 
For the non-mutated BRCA population, 32 (56%) subjects in the olaparib arm and 44 (72%) in the placebo arm 
had a PFS event. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34 to 0.85). The Kaplan-Meier 
(KM) median PFS from randomization was 7.4 months (95%CI 5.5, 10.3) in the olaparib arm and 5.5 months 
(95%CI 3.7, 5.6) in the placebo arm, resulting in an improvement of the median PFS of 1.9 months.  
This PFS improvement in the overall population was clinically relevant and observed regardless the sub-groups 
(BRCAm and non-mutated BRCA population). All analyses of PFS, including sensitivities (eg, evaluation time 
bias, attrition bias, and those adjusted for ECOG PS) demonstrated a consistent and favourable treatment 
benefit for olaparib.   
However, magnitude of PFS improvement was distinct depending on the BRCA mutation status (HR of 0.18 in 
BRCAm and HR of 0.54 in non-BRCAm). This difference explains why the HR of the overall population is pulled 
upward (HR 0.39; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.56; p<0.00001). In order to better estimate the magnitude of benefit in 
patients without germline BRCA1/2 mutations, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of the OPINION 
study, a phase IIIb single-arm, open-label, multicentre study of maintenance therapy in PSR non-germline 
BRCA mutated ovarian cancer patients who are in complete or partial response following platinum based 
chemotherapy.

The Study 19 was not powered and designed to show OS benefit. The descriptive final analysis (DCO: 09 May 
2016) was performed at 79% maturity in the FAS (210 deaths out of 265 patients). Even if statistical 
significance was not reached, OS data were numerically in favour of the olaparib arm in terms of reduced risk of 
death (HR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.95; p=0.02138).  
In the BRCAwt/VUS group, the estimate for the median OS was 24.5 months in the olaparib arm and 26.6 
months in the placebo arm, with 95%CI for HR exceeding 1 (HR 0.84 95%CI 0.57-1.25, p=0.3975), but as 
highlighted previously this patient population is highly heterogeneous and a larger sample size or analysis in 
specific subgroups would be more informative. Further analyses addressing subgroups by HRD status in 
gBRCAwt patients in a larger study are required as based on main mechanism of action, patients without HRD 
would not benefit from PARPi, and although platinum sensitivity would allow enriching patient population in HRD 
deficient tumours, this clinical marker will not optimally select the patient population. To identify patients who 
are likely to benefit to a greater extent, the MAH should investigate predictive biomarkers within this patient 
group in the context of the OPINION study. 
Analysis of exploratory efficacy endpoints showed a reduction in the risk of discontinuation of study treatment or 
death,  in the olaparib group, compared with the placebo group in overall population (FAS): HR of 0.39, 95% CI 
0.30 to 0.51, p<0.00001, and a lengthening of time until the first subsequent anti-cancer therapy and the 
second subsequent therapy or death, compared with placebo: HR of 0.39, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.52, p<0.00001 and 
HR of 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.69, p<0.00001 for TFST and TSST respectively. 
These exploratory efficacy outcomes support the PFS results, by showing that the treatment benefit of olaparib 
is maintained beyond the treatment period. This beneficial effect of maintenance therapy was found whatever 
the subgroup. However, it was more pronounced in BRCA mutated patients.  
No PFS2 data has been reported for the Study 19 and TSST was used. Although the clinical relevance of TSST is 
acknowledged, PFS2 by independent review is a more unbiased measure of long-term term benefit. 
Using descriptive statistics, there was no indication of impact on the quality of life, as measured by TOI and total 
FACT-O scores. However, the robustness of data is questioned and does not allow definitive conclusions to be 
made. 
The  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  the  efficacy  outcomes  in  the  subgroup  of  20  patients  defined  as  patients 
harbouring somatic BRCA mutations based on the most recent analysis of genomic data and to discuss current 
knowledge on the incidence of somatic BRCA 1/2 mutations and their predictive value for PARPi therapy. In 
Study 19, sBRCA mutations represented 18% of tBRCA cases with confirmed s/g status (20/114). In this smaller 
group of patients identified as sBRCAm in Study 19, a PFS HR = 0.23 (95% CI [0.04 to 1.12]), with a median PFS 
not reached in the olaparib group and of 4.7 months in the placebo group.  No data in new patients are available 
to date.  
Interpretation of the results in the overall population of the Study 19 should be done with caution given that the 
prevalence rate of BRCAm (germline and somatic) may not reflect the real world prevalence, since only about 
10-15% of cases would occur in patients with germline BRCA mutation plus about 5-6% of patients with tumours 
harbouring somatic BRCA mutations. However, about half of patients in the Study 19 had BRCA mutations. To 
date, no larger prospective studies have been reported to allow a more precise estimation of the proportion of 
patients with BRCAwt tumours, but this patient population represents a majority of patients with HGSOC.

The Cancer Atlas Genome has shown that 96% of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma have TP53 somatic 
mutations, thus suggesting that mutation of this gene is a virtually path gnomic, defining feature of this cancer. 
The histologic analysis of the few wild-type TP53 showed that the large majority of these tumours have 
morphologic features not typical of HGSOC or are not pure HGSOC; furthermore, the analysis of the molecular 
features indicate that these tumours are not HGS-OvCas (Testa et al, 2018). Therefore, the conclusion was that 
100% of HGSOC are TP53-mutate. The large majority of these TP53 mutants exhibit a loss of- the function of 
normal TP53. The TP53 mutation is the first genetic somatic mutation occurring during HGS-OvCa development, 
as supported by the observation that TP53 mutations are observed in early tumor precursor lesions. Seagle and 
coworkers analyzed the impact of the location of TP53 mutation within the TP53 protein on overall survival: 
patients with missense mutations located in the minor groove of the DNA binding domain of TP53 have a clearly 
better OS than those with missense mutations at the level of the major groove of the DNA binding domain (Testa 
et al, 2018). 
With the aim to define the subgroup of patients that would not benefit from olaparib maintenance treatment, the 
MAH committed to further characterise TP53 mutational status in ongoing and planned olaparib trials. 
Finally, recent evidence suggests that serous and endometrioid carcinomas arise from the tubal fimbrae, 
suggesting similar biology and origin for the high grade epithelial histologies (Jayson et al 2014). Pennington et 
al reported in their study that contrary to the common belief of homologous recombination deficiencies being 
characteristic of high-grade serous ovarian cancer only, DNA repair deficiencies were found equally commonly in 
carcinomas with non-serous histology (Pennington et al 2014). This supports the extension of the indication to 
other histological types. 
Study D0816C00020 (“OPINION”)  
The MAH proposed a single-arm study in 250 patients to investigate the efficacy and safety of olaparib in the 
non-gBRCA population with post-enrolment analysis of HRD status. To ensure that the study is truly 
representative of this population, prospective testing was not deemed appropriate by the MAH. Collection of 
tumour tissue is mandatory for all enrolled patients in order to conduct the Myriad HRD testing. As the HRD 
status of the subjects enrolled is mutually exclusive, the population will consist entirely of HRD scar positive and 
HRD scar negative patients. The natural prevalence would allow for a representation of both groups (54 to 59% 
HRD scar negative and 41 to 46% HRD scar positive). HRD testing will be conducted when approximately 25%, 
50%, 75% and 100% of patients have been enrolled on to the study and the proportion of HRD scar positive and 
HRD scar negative patients be assessed at these timepoints. Should these numbers not align with the 
anticipated natural prevalence, steps will be taken to modify the protocol accordingly, to ensure an appropriate 
distribution between the two groups for conducting the analyses.  
The MAH committed to revise the protocol and upgrade OS to a secondary endpoint. OS data will highly depend 
on the rate with which patients will be included in the study. Therefore, the collection of OS data should not be 
limited to a particular time point. This study is requested in accordance with the PAES delegated act c) 
(uncertainties with respect to the efficacy of a medicinal product in certain sub-populations that could not be 
resolved prior to marketing authorisation and require further clinical evidence). The MAH will submit the results 
by June 2021 (see Annex II).

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Extrapolation of efficacy results obtained with capsule formulation to tablet formulation is reasonably supported 
by PK data.  
PFS benefit has been confirmed in patients with germline BRCA mutated high grade serious PSR ovarian cancer 
in the Study SOLO2 conducted with tablet formulation and further long-term data have been provided in 
patients with high grade serous PSR ovarian cancer regardless the BRCA mutation status in the Study 19 
conducted with the capsule formulation. Study 19 data support the indication in patients including patients 
beyond gBRCA mutated tumours.  
Efficacy in non-mutated BRCA patients has only been provided based on Study 19 results, for patients with high 
grade serous ovarian cancer. However, consistent results have been reported in the SOLO2 study for patients 
with high grade serous or endometrioid cancer. In addition, the mechanism of action of olaparib and recent 
evidence on the biologic features of high grade epithelial ovarian tumors support an extension of the indication 
from “serous” to other histological types. 
Given an existing uncertainty in regard to magnitude of benefit in patients with gBRCAwt which should be 
balanced against known toxicity, and a potential for reduced benefit in subset of patients without HRD, the MAH 
should provide additional evidence specifically in this group of patients. Moreover, further investigation of 
biomarkers of HRD, such as TP53 disruptive status, that would allow to identify patients that benefit the most 
and optimise the target population. The OPINON study is expected to provide additional data (see Annex II).  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Across the entire clinical programme, as of 15 December 2016, an estimated 6558 patients with ovarian, breast, 
pancreatic, prostate, gastric or a variety of other solid tumours have received treatment with olaparib (tablet or 
capsule formulations) in AstraZeneca-sponsored studies.

Main phase III study: SOLO2 
The SOLO2 study provides the main safety data for the use of olaparib 300 mg bd tablet.  
SOLO2 was a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study of olaparib (300 mg bd 
tablet) as a maintenance treatment in PSR BRCA mutated ovarian cancer patients who were in complete or 
partial response following platinum-based chemotherapy. A total of 295 patients were randomised (196 were 
randomised to olaparib and 99 to placebo). The data cut off of safety data presented in this study is 19 
September 2016. The SOLO2 data are supported by safety data from an additional 7 studies, with a total of 482 
patients with advanced solid tumours 271 of whom were documented to have ovarian cancer.  
The 300 mg bd tablet pool is made up of the SOLO2 study along with these 7 other supportive studies. 
Supportive study: Study 19 (phase II) 
Data from Study 19 provide a comparative dataset of the capsule formulation of olaparib in the PSR ovarian 
cancer maintenance treatment setting. Study 19 was a Phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicentre study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of olaparib 400 mg bd capsules as a maintenance 
treatment in patients with PSR ovarian cancer who were in response to platinum-based chemotherapy. A total

of 264 patients received treatment (136 received olaparib and 128 received placebo). The data cut off of safety 
data presented in this study is 09 may 2016. 
An additional 11 studies provide supportive safety data for the use of olaparib 400 mg bd capsule, with a total 
of 766 patients with advanced solid tumours. The capsule pool includes 398 patients who were documented to 
have BRCAm ovarian cancer. 
Patient exposure  
•  SOLO2 
A total of 295 patients were randomised in SOLO2; 196 patients randomised to olaparib and 99 patients 
randomised to placebo received study treatment. All 295 patients had gBRCA mutations as this was a 
requirement for study entry. The data cut off of safety data presented in this study is 19 september 2016.

Dose modifications 
The number of patients with an interruption of the treatment was 54% in the olaparib group and 23% in the 
placebo group. The reason for interruption of the treatment is the occurrence of adverse event for 43.6% of 
patients in the olaparib group and 18.2% of patients in the placebo group.  
The number of patients with dose reduction was 30% in the olaparib group and 6% in the placebo group. The 
reason for dose reduction is the occurrence of adverse event for 27% of patients in the olaparib group and 3% 
of patients in the placebo group. 
Overall extent of exposure: Olaparib 300 mg bd tablet pool 
Other than SOLO2, most of the additional exposure is in Phase I clinical pharmacology studies with intended 
short durations of exposure.  Of the 482 patients, 231 (47.9%) had 6 months exposure and 145 (30.1%) had 12 
months exposure.  The number of patients in the tablet pool with olaparib exposure beyond 12 months was 
similar to that for SOLO2.

Duration of treatment was collected in days. An approximation of treatment duration in months was made by dividing the time 
points in days by 30.42 (based on 365 days/12 months) and selecting the one that was closest to (but not longer than) the 
treatment month. 
Rows are cumulative and patients are included if they have taken treatment beyond the treatment day stated in the 
parenthesis. DCO Data cut-off; SAS Safety analysis set.

Overall extent of exposure: Olaparib 400 mg bd capsule pool 
Of the 766 patients, 325 (42.4%) had 6 months exposure and 140 (18.3%) had 12 months exposure.  The 
number of patients in the capsule pool with olaparib exposure beyond 4 years was the same as that for Study 19. 
Adverse events – Pooled dataset 
Adverse events were analysed following the pooling strategy In SOLO2 study, the majority of patients (98.5%) 
had at least 1 AE reported with olaparib but also with placebo (97.8%). However, AE of CTCAE grade 3 or higher 
and SAE were more frequently reported with olaparib (respectively 37.9% and 17.9%), which is understood. 
Serious and CTCAE Grade 3 or above adverse events did not always lead to treatment discontinuation (10.8%). 
Proportion of patients with any AE, AE of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher and SAE are similar between SOLO2 study and 
the tablet pool and also between Study 19 and the capsule pool. 
Proportion of patients with AE of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher and SAE are higher in the capsule pool than in the 
tablet pool (respectively 45.3% and 26.4% vs. 36.1% and 19.7%).

Data derived from Study 19 CSR, Table 11.1.4, and Table 11.1.15 (DCO 18 December 2013) 
In SOLO2 study, the most common SOCs for reported AEs were: Gastrointestinal disorders (90.3% of patients 
in the olaparib group vs. 75.8% of patients in the placebo group), General disorders and administration site 
conditions (77.9% vs. 48.5%), Nervous system disorders (56.9% vs. 32.3%), Infections and infestations 
(54.9% vs. 40.4%), and Blood and lymphatic system disorders (48.7% vs. 12.1%). The most common AEs 
(reported by >30% patients) in the olaparib arm were nausea, anaemia, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhoea and 
asthenia. 
Haematological toxicity was reported at an increased frequency with the tablet formulation, compared with the 
capsule formulation; however, anaemia remained manageable by interrupting or reducing the olaparib dose or 
giving blood transfusions, when indicated; treatment discontinuation was rarely required.  Reports of 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia remained at low frequency with the tablet formulation; these events were 
primarily low grade and rarely required treatment discontinuation.   
In general, the onset of AEs by treatment period was similar for SOLO2 and Study 19.  The majority of AEs 
occurred within the first 3 months of treatment 
In SOLO2 study, there was a higher percentage of patients with AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥3 in the olaparib group 
(36.2%) compared with the placebo group (18.2%), which is understood. The most common AE of CTCAE Grade

≥3 reported on olaparib treatment was anaemia (19.5%). The overall percentage of CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs for 
the other individual PTs, (ie, other than anaemia) was much lower (maximum of 3.1%).

Two cases of gastric cancer occurred among 1248 patients included in tablet and capsule pool studies. No 
relationship has been established between the occurrence of gastric cancer and the treatment with olaparib.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  Serious adverse event 
During SOLO2 study, a higher proportion of patients reported SAEs in the olaparib group (17.9%) compared 
with the placebo group (8.1%), either during treatment (median time in study was approximately 3 times longer 
in the olaparib group than in the placebo group) or in the 30-day follow-up period.

Most SAE PTs were reported in only one patient each.  The most common SAE was anaemia; the only other SAEs 
reported in ≥2 patients in the olaparib treatment group were abdominal pain, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 
gastric cancer and intestinal obstruction.  A total of 52 SAEs were reported by patients in the olaparib group, 
with only SAEs of anaemia (12 SAEs in 7 patients), intestinal obstruction (4 SAEs in 3 patients) and peripheral 
oedema (2 SAEs in 1 patient) being reported more than once by any patient.  SAEs reported in only 1 patient 
included an event of anaphylactic reaction and an event of hypersensitivity, both of which were reported to be 
related to administration of contrast media. In the olaparib group, a low proportion of patients (18 patients 
[9.2%]) had SAEs reported that were considered by the investigator to be causally related to study treatment; 
the only SAE considered treatment-related by the Investigators occurring in more than 1 patient was anaemia 
(6 patients [3.1%]).  There were no SAEs in the placebo group that were considered to be causally related to 
study treatment. 
In the olaparib arm, the majority of the 52 SAEs reported occurred whilst on treatment, with 10 SAEs having a 
date of onset during the safety follow-up.  AEs of MDS/AML and new primary malignancies are collected beyond 
the 30-day follow-up period. Only 8 SAEs in the olaparib arm were not resolved/recovered at the cut-off date for 
this analysis (anaemia, abdominal pain, back pain, blood creatinine increased, DVT, MDS and muscular 
weakness); the majority had resolved with either no action taken or following a temporary dose 
interruption/dose change. 
Deaths 
In SOLO2 study, 72 patients (24.4%) died during the study; 45 (23.0%) and 27 (27.3%) in the olaparib and 
placebo groups, respectively. All patients had death related to the disease under investigation only, apart from 
one patient in the olaparib arm who developed AML and died 177 days after her last dose of olaparib and one 
patient in the placebo arm with subsequent olaparib exposure who developed AML and died 442 days after her 
last dose of placebo and approximately 3 months after her last dose of post-study olaparib treatment. 
In all 4 datasets, the vast majority of deaths were due to disease under study, with few patients reporting AEs 
leading to death. 
Other significant events 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia, pneumonitis and new primary malignancies have been 
classified in the Risk Management Plan as important potential risks. 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) /acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) 
The overall reporting incidence rate of MDS/AML in olaparib treated patients to date (data cut off 15 December 
2016) across the programme is 0.49%, with 32 reports being received in 6558 patients treated with olaparib 
across the clinical programme. The 32 reports of MDS/AML comprise of the 21 reports from the olaparib 
monotherapy all doses pool. Seventeen of the 21 patients died (13 due to MDS/AML as either a primary or 
secondary cause of death and 4 due to other causes). 
Where a placebo comparison is available, the incidence in the olaparib and placebo arms is similar, and when 
larger populations of olaparib treated patients are considered the incidence remains below 1.5%. The incidence 
rates calculated all remain within the range observed in the literature where reported incidence of secondary 
MDS/AML in ovarian cancer patients ranges from 0.15% to 1.8%. There was a similar broad range of time to 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation

onset of MDS/AML in both the olaparib- and placebo-treated patients, with no obvious difference in the median 
time to onset of events. 
A causal relationship between olaparib treatment and the development or acceleration of MDS/AML has not been 
established. 
All patients had potential contributing factors for the development of MDS/AML. All patients had received 
previous chemotherapy with DNA damaging agents, with many patients having previous chemotherapy with 
multiple treatment regimens over multiple years including carboplatin, taxanes, anthracyclines, other alkylating 
and DNA damaging agents and radiotherapy. 
Data provides in SOLO2 are reassuring since the incidence of MDS/AML in olaparib-treated patients is similar to 
that with placebo. However, the time of follow-up in this study is too short to bring any conclusion. 
Post-authorisation studies need to be conducted for a better assessment of this potential risks. 
Other new primary malignancies 
In SOLO2, the data show that where a placebo comparison is available, the incidence in the olaparib (0.51%) 
and placebo (1.01%) arms was similar. 
In study 19 (DCO = 09 May 2016), the incidence was lower in the placebo-treated patients (0.78%) compared 
with olaparib-treated patients (2.94%). 4 patients developed a new primary malignancies on olaparib at the 
DCO 09 May 2016, whereas, it has occurred in only 2 patients at the DCO 26 November 2012.  
When larger populations of olaparib treated patients are considered the incidence remains below 2%. 
Patients enrolled into the olaparib clinical studies had already received prior chemotherapy with multiple cycles 
of platinum containing chemotherapy.  Time from cancer diagnosis, onset of secondary cancers was generally 
several years and was overlapping with time when patients were receiving olaparib. Whilst it is not possible to 
exclude a contribution of olaparib, a causal relationship between olaparib treatment and the development of new 
primary malignancies has not been established. 
Pneumonitis 
Three pneumonitis (grade 1) occurred in the olaparib arm of SOLO2 (none in the placebo group) and one (also 
grade 1) in study 19.  Overall 8 AEs occurred in the monotherapy group (0.48%) and 35 in the entire clinical 
program (0.53%). The frequency of pneumonitis events observed within the olaparib clinical trial programme 
continues to appear consistent with expected rates for cancer patients based on published data for patients with 
lung cancer.  
Adverse drug reactions 
SOLO2 study 
92.3% of olaparib-treated patients and 62.6% placebo-treated patients had AEs were considered by the 
investigator to be causally-related to study treatment. Nausea and fatigue were the most frequently reported 
AEs considered by the investigator to be causally related to study treatment.

Most of the patients who had AEs considered causally-related to treatment had CTCAE Grade ≤2 events, with 
29.7% olaparib-treated patients and 7.1% placebo-treated patients having related events of CTCAE Grade ≥3 
severity.  The most common high-grade, treatment-related event in the olaparib-treated group was anaemia 
(18.5% patients); asthenia, nausea and neutrophil count decreased each occurred in 2.6% olaparib-treated 
patients, neutropenia and vomiting each occurred in 2.1% patients and all other events occurred in ≤3 patients.

associated with olaparib treatment 
Laboratory findings 
In clinical studies with Lynparza the incidence of CTCAE grade ≥2 shifts (elevations) from baseline in blood 
creatinine was approximately 15%. Data from a double-blind placebo-controlled study showed median increase 
up to 23% from baseline remaining consistent over time and returning to baseline after treatment 
discontinuation, with no apparent clinical sequelae. 90% of patients had creatinine values of CTCAE grade 0 at 
baseline and 10% were CTCAE grade 1 at baseline.

Safety in special populations 
Age: A similar proportion of patients had AEs, AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥3 and SAEs in all age categories. A higher 
proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs in the 75 to 84 years age category (10.7%), compared 
with <65 years (7.2%) and 65 to 74 years categories (7.5%). One AE (of AML) with an outcome of death (death 
occurring >30 days after last treatment dose) was reported in a patient in the 65 to 74 years age category.

There is no major difference in the safety profile of patients treated with olaparib aged <65 years versus ≥ 65 
years, nor within the age categories of 65 to 74 years and 75 to 84 years.  No patients were aged ≥ 85 years.

Race: Overall, there is no evidence of a difference in olaparib safety for White and non-White patients, but 
patient numbers are small in the non-White patient population.  
Hepatic impairment: A formal study (D0816C00005) to evaluate the impact of hepatic impairment on olaparib 
PK has been initiated and completed for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). Olaparib is not 
recommended for use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; however, no olaparib dose 
adjustment is considered warranted for patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment: A formal study (D0816C00006) was conducted to evaluate the impact of renal impairment 
on the overall clearance of olaparib with patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 51 mL/min to 80 mL/min) and 
moderate renal impairment (CrCl 31 mL/min to 50 mL/min). 
Olaparib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment; the dosage should be reduced to 
200 mg bd in patients with moderate renal impairment, however, no olaparib dose adjustment is considered 
warranted for patients with mild renal impairment. 
Effect of Food: Study D0816C00004 has evaluated the effect of food (a high fat meal) on the PK of the olaparib 
tablet formulation in 60 patients. Data show that food does not significantly affect the extent of exposure to 
olaparib. Olaparib may be taken with or without regard to meals. 
Safety in long-term use 
There are limited data available for patients treated with olaparib therapy beyond 2 years. 
At the DCO of 19 September 2016, 62.1% of patients in SOLO2 have received olaparib treatment for ≥12 
months and 30.3% of patients have received olaparib for ≥24 months. 23.5% of patients (32 patients) in Study 
19 have received treatment beyond 2 years. Other completed studies with olaparib have treated later line 
patients with relapsed disease.

Post marketing experience 
The capsule formulation of olaparib is currently approved in the 52 countries worldwide for the treatment of 
patients with ovarian cancer.  As of 15 December 2016, a total of 676 patients have been dosed with olaparib 
capsules in the following Global Access Programmes: Named Patient Supply Scheme, French Authorisation of 
Temporary Use, Turkish Compassionate Use Programme, UK Early Access to Medicines Scheme, UK 
Compassionate Use Programme, German Compassionate Use Programme, Dutch Compassionate Use 
Programme, and USA early Access programme.  In addition, there are a number of ongoing clinical studies in 
which patients have been dosed with either olaparib tablets or a blinded comparator agent.   
No new or important safety information resulting in changes to the safety profile of olaparib has been identified 
from the ongoing studies or patient access programme. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety results with olaparib 300 mg bd tablet are mainly coming from the phase III SOLO2 study. Pooled safety 
data from additional 7 studies in patients with advanced solid tumours (271 of whom were documented to have 
ovarian cancer) were also submitted by the MAH. 
Data from the phase II Study 19 and an additional 11 studies provide a comparative dataset of the capsule 
formulation of olaparib in the PSR ovarian cancer maintenance treatment setting. 
Overall, the safety profile is based on pooled data from 1248 patients treated with Lynparza monotherapy in 
clinical trials in the therapeutic indication at the 300mg bid and 400mg bid doses. 
In SOLO2 study, the most common AEs (reported by >30% patients) in the olaparib arm were nausea, anaemia, 
fatigue, vomiting, diarrhoea and asthenia. 
For a number of events reported at a higher (≥ 5%) frequency on olaparib compared with placebo, the 
exposure-adjusted event rates appear higher for placebo treated patients or similar between the arms 
(decreased appetite, diarrhoea, headache and pyrexia).  This suggests that the difference in treatment duration 
between the arms may explain the differences in reporting frequencies observed in this study.   
Reporting AEs in terms of exposure-adjusted event rates indicates that for many of the most common events 
reported at a higher (≥ 5%) frequency on olaparib compared with placebo, the rate remains higher for 
olaparib-treated patients when adjusted for exposure: anaemia; dizziness; dysgeusia; dyspnoea; fatigue; 
leukopenia; nausea; neutropenia and vomiting.  Of these, anaemia, cough, dizziness, dysgeusia, fatigue, 
nausea, neutropenia and vomiting were considered as ADRs for olaparib by the MAH and reflected as such in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. Based on these new data, leukopenia and cough was also considered as ADR and the 
SmPC was amended accordingly. 
In studies pool, the most common AE was nausea, and this was consistently reported across SOLO2, Study 19, 
and the tablet and capsule pools. Other common events (≥ 30%) that were consistently reported (≤ 5% 
difference between SOLO2 and Study 19) were vomiting, diarrhoea and asthenia/fatigue. 
Nausea was generally reported very early, with first onset within the first month of Lynparza treatment in the 
majority of patients. Vomiting was reported early, with first onset within the first two months of Lynparza 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation  
EMA/228768/2018 
Page 144/163 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
treatment in the majority of patients. Both nausea and vomiting were reported to be intermittent for the 
majority of patients and could be managed by dose interruption, dose reduction and/or antiemetic therapy. 
Antiemetic prophylaxis is not required. 
In general, the onset of AEs by treatment period was similar for SOLO2 and Study 19.  The majority of AEs 
occurred within the first 3 months of treatment.  In the first 3 months of treatment, AEs of anaemia, asthenia, 
dysgeusia and hypomagnesaemia occurred at a higher frequency (≥ 5% difference) in SOLO2 compared with 
Study 19; whereas events of abdominal distension, dyspepsia and fatigue occurred at a higher frequency in 
Study 19. 
Proportions of patients with AE of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher and SAE are lower in the tablet pool than in the 
capsule pool (respectively 45.3% and 26.4% vs. 36.1% and 19.7%). 
The most commonly reported event of CTCAE Grade ≥3 was anaemia in all 4 populations; the proportion of 
patients with Grade ≥3 anaemia was higher in SOLO2 (19.5%) than in Study 19 (5.9%).However anaemia 
remained manageable by interrupting or reducing the olaparib dose or giving blood transfusions, when indicated 
and treatment discontinuation was rarely required. 
The incidence of elevations in mean corpuscular volume from low or normal at baseline to above the ULN was 
approximately 55%. Levels appeared to return to normal after treatment discontinuation and did not appear to 
have any clinical consequences. 
Baseline testing, followed by monthly monitoring of complete blood counts is recommended for the first 12 
months of treatment and periodically after this time to monitor for clinically significant changes in any parameter 
during treatment which may require dose interruption or reduction and/or further treatment (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4). 
In clinical studies with Lynparza the incidence of CTCAE grade ≥  2 shifts (elevations) from baseline in blood 
creatinine was approximately 15%. Data from a double blind placebo controlled study showed median increase 
up to 23% from baseline remaining consistent over time and returning to baseline after treatment 
discontinuation, with no apparent clinical sequelae. 90% of patients had creatinine values of CTCAE grade 0 at 
baseline and 10% were CTCAE grade 1 at baseline. 
The proportion of patients who permanently discontinued olaparib due to AEs was low. The only AE leading to 
discontinuation that occurred at ≥2% difference between any of the treatment groups was anaemia, which led 
to discontinuation in 3.1% patients in SOLO2 compared with no patients in Study 19. Discontinuations due to 
anaemia was also higher in the tablet pool than in the capsule pool but the difference was <2%. 
A lower proportion of patients reported SAEs in tablet pool than in capsule pool. Most SAEs were reported as 
single PTs in SOLO2 and Study 19. The most common SAE was anaemia and the SOCs where SAEs were most 
commonly reported were gastrointestinal disorders and blood and lymphatic system disorders. Proportions of 
SAEs reported in blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC were similar between tablet pool and capsule pool 
whereas gastrointestinal disorders SOC were reported with higher frequency in the capsule pooled studies. 
Although, the safety dataset contributing to long-term exposure to olaparib in SOLO2 study are limited, the 
long-term exposure was demonstrated in Study 19 with olaparib 400mg bd capsule. In this study, only two 
patients received olaparib 400mg tablets beyond 7 years of treatment is however limited. 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation  
EMA/228768/2018 
Page 145/163 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
In SOLO study, proportion of patients reported SAEs in the olaparib group was 17.9%. A total of 52 SAEs were 
reported in the olaparib group, with only SAEs of anaemia (12 SAEs in 7 patients), intestinal obstruction (4 SAEs 
in 3 patients) and peripheral oedema (2 SAEs in 1 patient) being reported more than once by any patient. 
The overall reporting incidence rate of MDS/AML in olaparib treated patients to date across the programme is 
0.49%, with 32 reports being received in 6558 patients treated with olaparib across the clinical programme. The 
32 reports of MDS/AML comprise of the 21 reports from the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool. Seventeen of 
the 21 patients died (13 due to MDS/AML as either a primary or secondary cause of death and 4 due to other 
causes). 
The causality relationship with prior olaparib exposure might not be dismissed in the occurrence of AML and 
death of one patient due to exposure of this patient, initially treated in the placebo group, to olaparib during 3 
months in the post treatment phase at progression. This patient died 6 months after the first dose of olaparib. 
The time frame is compatible with this aggressive disease.  
Where a placebo comparison was available, the incidence in the olaparib and placebo arms was similar, and 
when larger populations of olaparib treated patients were considered, the incidence remained below 1.5%. The 
incidence rates calculated remained within the range observed in the literature where reported incidence of 
secondary MDS/AML in ovarian cancer patients ranges from 0.15% to 1.8%. 
There was a similar broad range of time to onset of MDS/AML in both the olaparib- and placebo-treated patients, 
with no obvious difference in the median time to onset of events. It is acknowledge that all patients had received 
previous chemotherapy with DNA damaging agents, with many patients having previous chemotherapy with 
multiple treatment regimens over multiple years including carboplatin, taxanes, anthracyclines, other alkylating 
and DNA damaging agents and radiotherapy. 
Data provided in SOLO2 are reassuring since the incidence of MDS/AML in olaparib-treated patients is similar to 
that with placebo. However, because of the relatively short exposure and follow-up in this study no conclusion 
can be drawn. Periodic reviews via the collection and assessment of data emerging from the ongoing clinical 
program are foreseen in the RMP to further characterise these events (see RMP section). 
In SOLO2, the data show that the incidence of other new primary malignancies in the olaparib (0.51%) and 
placebo (1.01%) arms was similar. In study 19, the incidence was lower in the placebo-treated patients (0.78%) 
compared with olaparib-treated patients (2.94%) as of 09 May 2016. When larger populations of olaparib 
treated patients are considered, the incidence remains below 2%. 
Whilst it is not possible to exclude a contribution of olaparib, a causal relationship between olaparib treatment 
and the development of new primary malignancies has not been established. No routine risk minimisation 
measures are planned in the risk management plan to address this potential risk, which is considered 
acceptable.

Special populations 
A similar proportion of patients had AEs, AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥3 and SAEs in all age categories. A slightly higher 
proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs in the 75 to 84 years age category (10.7%), compared 
with <65 years (7.2%) and 65 to 74 years categories (7.5%). However, the safety data in patients aged 75 or 
over are limited.  
There is no evidence of a difference in olaparib safety for White and non-White patients, but patient numbers are 
small in the non-White patient population.   
Olaparib is not recommended for use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; however, no 
olaparib dose adjustment is considered warranted for patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
Olaparib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment; the dosage should be reduced to 
200 mg bd in patients with moderate renal impairment, however, no olaparib dose adjustment is considered 
warranted for patients with mild renal impairment. 
Overdose 
There is limited experience of overdose with olaparib. Data derived from 5 patients from the SOLO2 study who 
took a daily dose of up to 900 mg of olaparib tablets over two days reported no unexpected adverse reactions. 
Symptoms of overdose are not established and there is no specific treatment in the event of Lynparza overdose. 
In the event of an overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and should treat the patient 
symptomatically. This is reflected in the product information. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of both capsule and tablet formulations are comparable. From the safety database all 
the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the SmPC. 
There is risk of medication error due to availability of capsule and tablet form on the market that cannot be 
substituted on a milligram-to-milligram basis. This could lead to possible overdoses if the capsule posology is 
used for the tablets and it was therefore agreed that a DHPC should be circulated at time of the launch of the 
tablet formulation in each Member State to raise awareness amongst healthcare professionals. In addition, 
separate SmPCs and PL for the capsule and the tablet formulations have been agreed, which all include clear 
statement informing that olaparib tablets and capsules are not to be substituted on a milligram-to-milligram 
basis due to differences in the dosing and bioavailability of each formulation. Distinct differences in the 
appearance of medication and packaging for tablets vs capsules (presentation, colour scheme, label design, and 
dosing statements on the packaging) have also been proposed and agreed. The CHMP considers that the 
measures adopted to minimise the risks of medication errors are satisfactory. It is important to minimise as 
much as possible the time where both the tablet and the capsule formulations will be available on the market 
and that the withdrawal of the capsules from the market is carefully managed.

2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list).  
2.6.4.  Direct healthcare professional communication 
A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) is considered necessary in order to communicate that 
the tablet and capsule formulations cannot be substituted on a milligram-to-milligram basis due to differences 
in the dosing and bioavailability of each formulation, and the potential risk of medication errors associated with 
the availability of these two presentations on the market. 
The DHPC is provided in Appendix 2 together with the communication plan. 
The MAH should agree the translations and local specificities of the DHPC with national competent authorities. 
The DHPC should be sent at time of the launch of the tablet formulation in each Member State to oncologists who 
are prescribers or potential prescribers of olaparib and pharmacists involved in dispensing olaparib.

2.9.  Product information 
As a consequence of the line-extension, a new SmPC was agreed for the new 100mg and 150mg film-coated 
tablets based on the SmPC of the capsule formulation. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.2 for the tablet 
formulation include information specific to the tablet formulation and relevant to the agreed indication and 
posology for Lynparza tablet which differ from the indication and posology of Lynparza capsule. 
In addition, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC of Lynparza capsule have been 
aligned with the updates proposed for the tablet formulation, as appropriate.  
A combined package leaflet has been agreed and updated accordingly. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the MAH 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initial authorization of the capsule formulation of Olaparib for the maintenance treatment of adult patients 
with platinum sensitive relapsed BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic) high grade serous epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (CR or PR) to platinum based chemotherapy 
was granted on December 2014. 
The proposed indication for tablet formulation of olaparib is, as monotherapy, the maintenance treatment of 
adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube or 
primary peritoneal) who are in response (CR or PR) to platinum-based chemotherapy (irrespective of the BRAC 
mutation and histological type). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are 3 primary treatment options for platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer patients:  
Platinum-based Chemotherapy Followed by Observation Only  
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation  
EMA/228768/2018 
Page 152/163 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Following response to second-line chemotherapy, per NCCN and ESMO guidelines, one of the options for ovarian 
cancer patients is to monitor until disease progression while managing the patient’s symptoms but not provide 
active anti-cancer treatment.  
Bevacizumab in Combination with Chemotherapy Followed by Bevacizumab Maintenance 
Bevacizumab is approved in Europe for use in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer in combination with 
platinum-based chemotherapy with continuation beyond chemotherapy in the maintenance setting; although 
this is not an option for patients who received bevacizumab in front line.  
Maintenance Therapy following response to platinum-based chemotherapy  
Olaparib (capsule formulation) is approved in Europe as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer with a BRCA mutation (either germline or tumour) who are in response (CR or PR) to 
platinum-based chemotherapy.  
On 14 September 2017, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending the granting of a marketing 
authorisation for Zejula (niraparib) as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer 
who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Results are mainly coming from two clinical studies: Study SOLO2 (using the tablet formulation), and Study 19 
(using the capsule formulation). 
SOLO2 study was a phase 3 randomised, double-blind study of maintenance therapy with olaparib tablet or 
placebo in platinum sensitive relapsed BRCA mutated ovarian cancer patients who are in complete or partial 
response following platinum containing chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study was PFS or death 
regardless of whether the patient discontinued randomised therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy 
prior to progression. Secondary objectives notably included PFS2, TFST, TSST and TDT.  
Study 19 was a phase II, randomised, double blind, multicentre placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy 
of olaparib capsule in the treatment of patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade serous ovarian 
cancer, who had received ≥2 previous platinum regimens and were in partial response or complete response 
following their last platinum-containing regimen. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate PFS. Main 
secondary objectives were OS, best overall response, disease control rate, duration of response, or change in 
tumour size. 
Long-term results have been provided in addition to those submitted for initial MAA with capsule formulation. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At the time of study SOLO2 data cut-off, 107 (54.6%) subjects in the Olaparib arm and 80 (80.8%) in the 
placebo arm had a PFS event. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.41), 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation  
EMA/228768/2018 
Page 153/163 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
indicating a 70% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for subjects in the Olaparib arm compared 
with those in the placebo arm. The median PFS from randomization was 19.1 months in the Olaparib arm and 
5.5 months in the placebo arm. At 24 months, 43% of patients in the olaparib group remained progression-free 
vs 15% of placebo patients. This PFS improvement is clinically relevant. 
PFS results were supported by other endpoints: Time to discontinuation of treatment or death (TDT), Time to 
first subsequent therapy or death (TFST, Time to second subsequent therapy or death (TSST). 
Study 19 data supported the initial marketing authorization, based solely on efficacy results in the BRCA 
mutated population. Results confirmed that patients with wt/VUS BRCA might benefit from olaparib. 
Consequently, only the FAS efficacy data were supportive of the broad indication without any mutation status 
restriction. Study 19 met its primary objective of statistically significantly improved investigator-assessed PFS 
(by RECIST) in the overall population treated with olaparib compared with placebo (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.25-0.49; 
p<0.00001; median 8.4 vs 4.8 months). 
A descriptive OS final analysis was performed at 79% maturity in the FAS. Even if statistical significance was not 
reached at the time of the analysis, survival data were numerically in favour of the Olaparib arm in terms of 
reduced risk of death (HR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.95; p=0.02138).  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints (TDT, TFST, TSST) support the PFS results, by indicating that the treatment 
benefit of olaparib is maintained beyond the treatment period.  
BRCAm subgroup 
At  the  DCO  of  30  June  2010,  PFS  outcomes  were  HR  0.18;  95%  CI  0.10  to  0.31;  median  PFS  11.2  vs  4.3 
months; p<0.00001. At the final analysis of OS (DCO 09 May 2016, 79% maturity), the HR for OS was 0.62 
(95% CI 0.42 to 0.93; median OS 34.9 vs 30.2 months; p=0.02140). Exploratory analyses of the intermediate 
clinical endpoints of TDT, TFST and TSST are in line with primary analysis. 
BRCA wt/VUS subgroup 
At the DCO of 30 June 2010, PFS outcomes were HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.85; median PFS 7.4 vs 5.5 months; 
p=0.00745. At the final analysis of OS (DCO 09 May 2016, 79% maturity), the HR for OS was 0.84 (95% CI 0.57 
to  1.25;  median  OS  24.5  vs  26.6  months;  p=0.39749).  Exploratory  analyses  of  the  intermediate  clinical 
endpoints of TDT, TFST and TSST are in line with primary analysis. 
The availability of the tablet formulation will also provide benefits in terms of fewer and smaller dose units and 
food-independent exposure. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Uncertainties remain with regard to the magnitude of benefit of Lynparza in gBRCAwt patients due to the 
heterogeneity of this patient population and since data in this subgroup of patients are limited. In order to 
further define the efficacy of olaparib in patients with platinum sensitive relapsed (PSR) non-germline BRCA 
mutated high grade ovarian cancer in the maintenance setting and investigate predictive biomarkers within this 
patient group, the MAH should submit the results of study D0816C00020 (OPINION), a phase IIIb single-arm, 
open-label, multicentre study of maintenance therapy in PSR non-germline BRCA mutated ovarian cancer 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation  
EMA/228768/2018 
Page 154/163 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
patients who are in complete or partial response following platinum based chemotherapy (Annex II). In addition, 
as patients without HRD would not benefit from PARPi due to their mechanism of action, the MAH should 
investigate predictive biomarkers within this patient group in the context of the OPINION study, to identify 
patients who are more likely to benefit to a greater extent. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the most common AEs reported for both tablet and capsule pool were nausea, asthenia/fatigue, 
vomiting, diarrhoea and anaemia. Proportions of patients with AE of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher and SAE were 
lower in the tablet pool than in the capsule pool (respectively 45.3% and 26.4% vs. 36.1% and 19.7%). 
Anaemia was reported at an increased frequency with the tablet formulation as compared to the capsule 
formulation. However, anaemia remained manageable by interrupting or reducing the olaparib dose or giving 
blood transfusions, when indicated; treatment discontinuation was rarely required. 
Proportion of patients reporting events of CTCAE Grade ≥3 was lower in the tablet pool (36.1%) compared to the 
capsule pool (45.3%). The most commonly reported event of CTCAE Grade ≥3 was anaemia in all 4 populations; 
the proportion of patients with Grade ≥3 anaemia was higher in SOLO2 (19.5%) than in Study 19 (5.9%). 
The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of olaparib was low. The only AE leading to discontinuation that 
occurred at ≥2% difference between any of the treatment groups was anaemia, which led to discontinuation in 
3.1% patients in SOLO2 compared with no patients in Study 19. Discontinuations due to anaemia was also 
higher in the tablet pool than in the capsule pool, the difference was <2%). 
There was a similar broad range of time to onset of MDS/AML in both the olaparib- and placebo-treated patients, 
with no obvious difference in the median time to onset of events.  
Data from SOLO2 are reassuring since the incidence of MDS/AML in olaparib-treated patients is similar to that 
with placebo. Data also show that the incidence of other new primary malignancies in the olaparib (0.51%) and 
placebo (1.01%) arms was similar.  
In study 19, the incidence was lower in the placebo-treated patients (0.78%) compared with olaparib-treated 
patients (2.94%) as the date of 09 May 2016. 4 patients developed new primary malignancies on olaparib.  
In all 4 datasets, the vast majority of deaths were due to the disease under study, with few patients reporting 
AEs leading to death. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In the SOLO2 study, grade ≥3 anaemia was reported at an increased frequency with the tablet formulation as 
compared to the capsule formulation used in study 19 (19.5% versus 5.9%, respectively). If, supposedly, this 
increased frequency could be linked to the tablet bioavailability that was shown to be approximately twice the 
capsule bioavailability, such a result was not observed for other events. Although anaemia remained usually 
manageable by interrupting or reducing olaparib dose, or giving blood transfusions when indicated, treatment 
discontinuation was nevertheless required in a minority of patients. Warning and recommendations have been 
included in the product information. 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation grouped with a variation  
EMA/228768/2018 
Page 155/163 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Data provided in SOLO2 are reassuring since the incidence of MDS/AML in olaparib-treated patients is similar to 
that with placebo. However, because of the relatively short exposure and follow-up in this study no firm 
conclusion can be drawn. To further characterise the potential risk of MDS/AML, the MAH will continue collecting 
data emerging from the ongoing clinical program. 
It should be noted that the patient population was more fit in SOLO-2 than in Study 19 in later lines of therapy. 
Hence the extent of difference in terms of toxicity between the 2 formulations is difficult to establish. Further 
safety data with the tablet formulation will be collected in the planned and ongoing studies described above. 
The posology and bioavailability for tablets and capsules are different and the two formulations should not be 
substituted on a milligram-to-milligram basis; there is a risk of overdose and increased adverse events if the 
capsule posology is used for the tablets or lack of efficacy if the tablet posology is used for the capsules. Relevant 
information is provided in the SmPC, labelling and package leaflet. In addition, a DHPC was agreed to raise 
awareness and minimise the risks associated with medication errors. The MAH also committed to minimise the 
time during which the two formulations will be available on the market. The CHMP considers that the agreed 
measures to minimise the risks of medication errors are satisfactory.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Demonstration of olaparib capacity to delay disease progression in patients who are in response to 
platinum-based chemotherapy was mainly based on PFS results from two randomised studies in patients with 
platinum-sensitive tumours. The use of PFS as primary endpoint is supported provided that there is no detriment 
on OS.  Whereas OS data from the SOLO2 study are still immature, newly provided data from the Study 19 do 
not indicate detrimental effect in overall ‘all-comers’ population regardless of the BRCA1/2 status. For patients 
with germline BRCA1/2 mutations, the magnitude of PFS benefit reported in SOLO2 and Study 19 is clinically 
relevant and supported by sensitivity analyses and secondary endpoints. 
The key issue for this application was the extrapolation of the results obtained with the capsule formulation to 
the tablet formulation.  
Overall, based on the available data, the safety and efficacy profile of both capsule and tablet formulations are 
comparable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Clinical data were provided in patients with BRCA germline mutated high grade PSR ovarian cancer for tablet 
formulation (SOLO2) and in patients with high grade serous PSR ovarian cancer irrespective of the BRCA 
mutation status (Study 19). 
Efficacy in non-mutated BRCA patients has only been provided based on Study 19 results, for patients with high 
grade serous ovarian cancer. However, in view of (i) consistent results in the SOLO2 study for patients with high 
grade endometrioid cancer; (ii) the olaparib mechanism of action and biological rationale suggesting benefit in 
high grade tumours; (iii) and in order to provide treatment option for patients with rare conditions that would 
benefit from treatment, indication is not restricted to “serous” histological type. 
Further data is requested to provide evidence of efficacy and better estimate the magnitude of benefit in BRCAwt 
subgroup, and to prospectively investigate biomarkers that would allow to define patients that benefit the most 
and optimise the target populations. This will be addressed in the OPINION study where post-enrolment analysis 
of HRD status will be done. 
A potential higher incidence of hemato-toxicity (≥ 3 grade anaemia) observed with the tablet formulation is 
outweighed by the demonstrated benefits in this patient population. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lynparza is positive. 
In order to further define the efficacy of olaparib in patients with platinum sensitive relapsed (PSR) non-germline 
BRCA mutated high grade ovarian cancer in the maintenance setting and investigate predictive biomarkers

within this patient group, the MAH should submit the results of study D0816C00020 (OPINION), a phase IIIb 
single-arm, open-label, multicentre study of maintenance therapy in PSR non-germline BRCA mutated ovarian 
cancer patients who are in complete or partial response following platinum based chemotherapy.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Lynparza is not similar to Yondelis and Zejula within the meaning 
of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of, Lynparza 100 mg and 150 mg tablet is favourable in the following indication: 
as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Lynparza subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Due date 
PAES: In order to further define the efficacy of olaparib in patients with platinum 
sensitive relapsed (PSR) non-germline BRCA mutated high grade ovarian cancer in the 
maintenance setting and investigate predictive biomarkers within this patient group, the 
MAH should submit the results of study D0816C00020 (OPINION), a phase IIIb 
single-arm, open-label, multicentre study of maintenance therapy in PSR non-germline 
BRCA mutated ovarian cancer patients who are in complete or partial response following 
platinum based chemotherapy.  
The clinical study report should be submitted by: 
June 2021 
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation(s) requested 
C.I.4 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, 
preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Type 
II 
The extension application is grouped with a type II variation to align the PI for the currently authorised capsule 
presentation with the safety updates proposed for the tablet formulation.

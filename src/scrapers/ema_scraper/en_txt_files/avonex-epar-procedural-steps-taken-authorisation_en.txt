Evaluation  of  Medicinal  Products  (EMEA)  an  application  to  obtain  marketing  authorisation  for  the

The  CPMP  in  its  meetings  of  7-8  June  1995  discussed  the  issue  of  the  proposed  tradename 
AVONEX.  
The company submitted a proposal for a modified trade name on the 7 July 1995. 
The  CPMP  in  its  meeting  of  11-13  July  1995  discussed  the  new  proposal  submitted  by  the 
company on the 7t July 1995, for a modified trade name. The new proposal was not accepted in 
principle because of its possible confusion with other existing medicinal products. It was  also 
requested  that  the  biotechnology  issues  be  discussed  at  the  Biotechnology  Working  Party 
(BWP) on 7 September 1995. 
The  Rapporteur’s  initial  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  members  of  the  CPMP  on24 
July 1995. 
The Co-Rapporteur’s initial assessment report was circulated to all members of the CPMP on 20 
July 1995. 
The  Biotechnology  Working  Party  during  its  meeting  on  8  September  1995,  discussed  the 
outstanding biotechnology issues and prepared a list of comments and a recommendation to the 
CPMP. 
The  CPMP  in  its  meeting  of  12-13  September  1995  considered  the  major  objections  to  the 
dossier and agreed on a consolidated list of substantial objections. During this pre-authorisation 
discussion it was decided that the inspection planned to take place in the non-EU manufacturing 
site should be postponed until the company had addressed the more fundamental issues. 
The CPMP consolidated List of Questions was sent to the company on 18 September 1995.  
During a meeting with the Rapporteur, Co-Rapporteur, the company and their individual expert 
teams  on  18  October  1995,  the  list  of  objections  was  clarified,  in  particular  in  relation  to  the 
issue of bioequivalence of the two relevant substances in the clinical data and also to the lack of 
pharmacokinetic data. 
On 3 November 1995 the company was reminded by the EMEA about two issues related to the 
postponed inspection and to the suitability of the trade name, to be resolved before the CPMP 
opinion could be granted.

On  5  February  1996,  a  meeting  was  held  with  the  company  experts,  the  Rapporteur,  Co-
Rapporteur and their respective assessor teams as well as additional BWP experts. During this 
meeting  the  company  gave  an  overview  of  their  intended  responses.  The  purpose  of  this 
meeting  was  to  advise  the  company  on  the  preparation  of  their  responses  to  the  consolidated 
List of Questions. 
The CPMP in its meeting of 13-15 February 1996 agreed the conduction of the postponed pre-
authorisation inspections of the manufacturing sites of the active substance and dosage form. 
On 1 March 1996, a meeting was held with the company during which advice on administrative 
and regulatory issues was sought. 
The  company  submitted  their  responses  to  the  CPMP  consolidated  list  of  questions  on 
14 March 1996. 
On 15-16 April 1996, the Dutch Inspectorate and an expert of the Rapporteur’s team inspected 
the  manufacturing  site  of  the  dosage  form,  Ben  Venue  Laboratories  in  the  United  States  of 
America.  Three  deficiencies  were  observed  which  were  required  to  be  resolved  before  a  pre-
authorisation approval. 
On 17-19 April 1996, a positive recommendation was made by the Dutch Inspectorate regarding 
the  manufacturing  site  of  the  active  ingredient,  Biogen  Inc.,  in  the  United  States  of  America, 
despite some minor objections in relation to Ben Venue Laboratories. 
The Rapporteur’s responses assessment report was circulated on 19 April 1996. 
The Co-Rapporteur’s responses assessment report was circulated on 15 April 1996. 
The CPMP in its meeting of 16-18 April 1996, discussed the possibility of finalising an opinion 
in May following an in-depth discussion and an oral presentation by the company. 
The Biotechnology Working Party in its meeting of 7-8 May 1996, was presented with an oral 
explanation  by  the  company  on  8  May  1996.  Following  this  hearing  a  BWP  Report  to  the 
CPMP recommending a positive opinion with regard to the quality issues, including a proposal 
for the pharmaceutical follow-up measures was drafted. 
The CPMP during its meeting of 21-23 May 1996, was presented with an oral explanation by 
the  company  on  21  May 1996.  The  CPMP,  having  considered  the  BWP  recommendation  and 
the  discussion  following  the  oral  explanation,  concluded  that  further  data  was  required  to 
resolve  the  remaining  issues,  particularly  on  neutralising  activity  in  patients  treated  with 
AVONEX. On 22 May 1996, the CPMP agreed on the conclusions drawn following the hearing 
(CPMP/456/96) and the clock was stopped. 
The CPMP conclusion on the remaining issues to be resolved (CPMP/456/96) was sent to the 
company on 24 May 1996. 
On  9 September  1996, a  meeting was  held with the company experts,  the  Rapporteur  and  the 
Co-Rapporteur.  During  this  meeting  the  company  presented  an  overview  of  the  proposed 
responses to the remaining antigenicity issues raised at the CPMP meeting of 21-23 May 1996. 
The  proposed  responses  were  discussed  and  suggestions  were  put  forward  to  aid  in  the 
preparation of the responses. On 4 October 1996, the company submitted their responses to the 
CPMP  conclusion  of  May  1996,  as  well  as  four  reports  addressing  pharmaceutical  points 
identified as follow-up measures during the BWP meeting in May 1996. 
On 15 October 1996, the Dutch Inspectorate informed the manufacturer of the dosage form in 
the  United  States  of  America  that  there  were  no  outstanding  pre-authorisation  issues  arising 
from the inspection of Ben Venue Laboratories performed on 15-16 April 1996, following their 
five follow-up responses on the deficiencies. 
The  Rapporteurs  assessment  report  and  recommendation  to  the  CPMP  on  the  company’s 
responses to the CPMP conclusions following the oral hearing in May 1996 was circulated on 
21 October 1996. 
The  Rapporteur’s  assessment  report  on  the  additional  pharmaceutical  data  was  circulated  on 
22 October 1996.

The CPMP, during its November meeting, considered and discussed the additional information 
provided  by  the  Applicant.  A  favourable  opinion  was  unanimously  adopted  recommending  a 
marketing authorisation for AVONEX to be granted under exceptional circumstances. 
The tradename issue was considered to be resolved, provided that no changes intervened with 
the current pharmaceutical forms of AVONEX (powder and solvent for solution for injection) 
and of Daivonex (ointment).  
The  specific obligations to be fulfilled by the Marketing Authorisation Holder  were discussed 
and  agreed and the information will be reviewed by the EMEA in the annual reassessment of 
the risk/benefit balance.

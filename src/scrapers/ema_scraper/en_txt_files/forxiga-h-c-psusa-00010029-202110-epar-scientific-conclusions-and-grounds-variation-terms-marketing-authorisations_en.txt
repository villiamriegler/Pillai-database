Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dapagliflozin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
In view of available data on two post-marketing cases of tubulointerstitial  nephritis from spontaneous 
reports, and given that  tubulointerstitial  nephritis is already labelled for other SGLT2 inhibitor  products, 
the PRAC considers a causal relationship between dapagliflozin and tubulointerstitial  nephritis is at 
least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing 
dapagliflozin should be amended accordingly. 
In view of available data on mechanistic study and in  view of a plausible mechanism of action, 
suggestive of a possible increase in lithium  clearance by dapagliflozin, the PRAC considers a drug-drug 
interaction between dapagliflozin and lithium is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded 
that  the product information of products containing  dapagliflozin should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for dapagliflozin the  CHMP is of the opinion that  the benefit-
risk balance of the  medicinal product(s) containing  dapagliflozin is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to  the product information 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

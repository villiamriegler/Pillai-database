Intrarosa (prasterone) is removed from the additional 
EMEA/H/C/PSR/S/0044 – Variation
II and PL
monitoring list as the condition to the marketing 
authorisation has been fulfilled. This relates to the non-
interventional PASS - Drug Utilisation Study (DUS) to 
describe the baseline characteristics, utilisation patterns of 
EU postmenopausal women initiating treatment with 
Intrarosa and to assess whether EU prescribers abide by 
the contraindications stated in the EU SmPC.
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures.
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

1.  Introduction 
On December 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Simbrinza®, eye drops, 
suspension, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the study CQVJ499A2001, “Post-marketing surveillance to observe the safety 
and efficacy of Simbrinza Eye Drops®” is a stand alone study. 
The study is not conducted in compliance with any agreed paediatric investigation plan. 
The MAH does not propose an update to the product information based on the results of this study.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Commercial  formulation  of  Simbrinza®,  eye  drops,  suspension  (Brinzolamide  10  mg/mL/ 
Brimonidine tartrate 2 mg/mL) was used in this study.  
As per Company Core Data Sheet and Korea prescription information, Simbrinza is indicated for the 
reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular 
hypertension. 
Simbrinza  is  administered  in  adults  as  one  drop  in  the  affected  eye(s)  two  or  three  times  daily. 
Simbrinza is contraindicated in children less than 2 years of age and not recommended in children 
or adolescents aged 2 to 17 years because of the potential for CNS depression due to the brimonidine 
tartrate component. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for study CQVJ499A2001: “Post-marketing surveillance to observe 
the safety and efficacy of Simbrinza Eye Drops®” 
2.3.2.  Clinical study CQVJ499A2001 
Description 
This  was  a  multicenter,  prospective,  observational, post-marketing  surveillance  study to  evaluate 
the  safety  and  efficacy  of  Simbrinza  in  Korean  patients  with  open  angle  glaucoma  or  ocular 
hypertension. 
Surveillance data from total of 693 patients were collected during the study period (from June 10, 
2015 to June 9, 2021) and the study was completed on 09-Jun-2021. 
This post-marketing surveillance will collect and evaluate the safety/ efficacy data in Korean patients 
while using Simbrinza Eye Drops or related information as a condition for approval of the new drug.

Methods 
Objective 
This post-marketing surveillance (PMS) aims to collect and evaluate the following events or relevant 
information during the use of Simbrinza Eye Drops on condition of new drug approval. 
•  Serious adverse events/adverse drug reactions 
•  Unexpected adverse events/ adverse drug reactions 
•  Known adverse drug reactions 
•  Mild adverse events 
•  Other safety information 
• 
Efficacy (effects on IOP) 
Study design 
This  study  was  designed  as  a  prospective,  observational,  multicenter,  non-interventional,  post-
marketing surveillance (PMS) study. The method used to obtain the safety and effectiveness data of 
Simbrinza Eye Drops was a total surveillance method, where the investigators included all patients, 
without  exception,  who  received  Simbrinza  Eye  Drops  until  the  number  of  patients  reached  the 
requested number and completed Case Report Forms (CRF) for all patients included. 
Study population /Sample size 
This  PMS  aims  to  recruit  at  least  600  patients  diagnosed  with  open-angle  glaucoma  or  ocular 
hypertension who 
•  Confirmed incomplete decrease in IOP with monotherapy 
•  Have been prescribed Simbrinza for the first time in the study eye 
Treatments 
Simbrinza  was  treated  based  on  local  approved  label.  The  recommended  dose  is  one  drop  of 
Simbrinza in the affected eye(s) two times daily. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
•  Safety endpoint: Incidence rates of adverse events after Visit 1 
• 
Efficacy endpoint: IOP at Week 12 and Week 24 or additional visits after 24 weeks 
Statistical Methods 
In this study, data was collected using CRF as per data collection schedule defined in protocol. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed/ Baseline data 
The analysis of baseline characteristics of the 679 patients who received Simbrinza eye drops and 
were assessed for safety during this study period, revealed that their age (mean ± SD) was 61.72 
± 13.09 years. There was only one patient (0.15%) of age < 18 years old.

This overview provides details on this one pediatric patient. This patient had ocular hypertension. 
The  patient  had  no  past  medical  history/  history  of  present  illness  at  the  time  of  enrolment.  The 
patient  received  a  daily  dosage  of  Simbrinza  between  2019  and  2020  (treatment  period  was  9 
months).  The  patient  continued  the treatment  of  Simbrinza  at  the  end of  study  and  the  IOP  was 
evaluated as improved. No AE was reported during the study period. 
The patient was included in both safety and efficacy analysis sets.

Efficacy results 
IOP reduction from baseline was 23.8% in the pediatric patient at week 12. It was interpreted as 
'improved' and categorized as 'effective' based on the protocol definition. 
Safety results 
No adverse event was reported in the pediatric patient. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Simbrinza in patients with open angle 
glaucoma  or  ocular  hypertension.  The  study  enrolled  only  one  paediatric  patient.  There  are 
insufficient data to allow any discussion on paediatric aspects. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
No  efficacy  or  safety  conclusion  can  be  made  from  the  single  paediatric  patient  enrolled  in  this 
observational study. The result of this study does not change the favourable benefit-risk profile of 
Simbrinza.  
 Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder that accounts for 
approximately 30% of adult leukemias and 25% of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL). The incidence of 
CLL decreases from West to East; in Caucasian males the incidence is 4.3/100,000, whereas in Asian 
males it is 0.7/100,000. There are about 8,500 new cases annually in the Unites States of America and 
numbers are similar in the European Union (EU).  
The World Health Organization classification scheme considers B-cell CLL and small lymphocytic 
lymphoma (SLL) in an aggregate category (CLL/SLL) because of shared clinical-pathological features. Of 
the hematological malignancies diagnosed between 2000 and 2002 in 44 European cancer registries as 
part of the HAEMACARE project, SLL/CLL was the most common subtype with 11,019 new cases and with 
a crude incidence rate of 4.92 per 100,000. Over the same period, the sex specific incidence rates were 
5.87 and 4.01 per 100,000, for males and females respectively. The incidence rates showed a close 
similarity across European registries. The estimated prevalence of CLL in the EU in 2012 was 2.83 per 
10,000 and in 2013 is 2.91 per 10,000. 
The incidence rate of CLL increases with age.  Over the period 2005 to 2009, the median age at diagnosis 
of CLL in the US was 72 years of age. Approximately 0.0% were diagnosed under the age of 20; 0.2% 
between 20 and 34; 1.6% between 35 and 44; 9.0% between 45 and 54; 20.9% between 55 and 64; 
26.5% between 65 and 74; 27.8% between 75 and 84; and 14.0% were aged 85 years or more. There 
are no estimates in the literature of the total number of CLL deaths in Europe.  There were approximately 
54,000 deaths from leukemia of all kinds in 2008. 
Approximately 95% of CLL has a B-cell origin with a characteristic immunophenotype (CD5+, CD23+, 
weak surface expression of CD19, CD20, CD79b and IgM or IgD) and blood smear morphology 
(mature-looking lymphocytes, Gumprecht’s shadows). CLL is an indolent disease with a variable patient 
survival time, from less than 2 years to 20 years or more. Many CLL patients initially present with 
lymphocytosis only and no other symptoms. Advanced disease stages are characterized by the 
appearance of lymphadenopathy, either hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, and bone marrow failure.

B−symptoms (i.e., fever, night sweats, and weight loss), general fatigue and recurrent infections are 
common in patients with late stage CLL, but may also be found earlier in the course of the disease. 
Asymptomatic patients with early-stage CLL (Rai Stage I/II or Binet Stage A or B) are usually monitored 
until they meet the criteria for treatment, since there is no survival benefit associated with early 
intervention.  
Available treatments generally induce remission, although nearly all patients relapse, and CLL remains an 
incurable disease, with the possible exception of the rare option of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, 
which due to its toxicity and intensity and the need for a donor is available only to a very small fraction of 
younger patients. None of the available treatment options is adequate for all CLL patients. 
Age is one of the most important prognostic factors in CLL. Another important prognostic factor in the 
elderly is the burden of comorbidity (such as cardiopulmonary or vascular disease, diabetes or a second 
cancer other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer). Survival is significantly impaired in CLL patients with 
multiple comorbidities (≥2) or with severe comorbidity. Both age and the incidence and burden of 
comorbidity should influence the choice of treatment strategy for individual patients. Adequate supportive 
treatment is necessary for the prevention of toxicities as well as for the improvement of health-related 
quality of life in elderly CLL patients. Treatment decisions in elderly CLL patients needs to be made 
carefully in each patient taking into consideration not only the stage and risk factors of the disease but 
also the patients’ physical condition and social environment. 
Currently, immunochemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is the 
standard of care for previously untreated patients with CLL who require treatment and are able to tolerate 
intense chemotherapy (European Society of Medical Oncology Guidelines 2011; National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network Guidelines, 2013). As demonstrated in a large randomized Phase III trial (CLL8), a 
complete remission rate of 44%, a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 52 months, and a 3-year 
overall survival of 87% can be expected with FCR treatment in previously untreated patients with CLL 
(Hallek et al. 2010). However immunochemotherapy with FCR is often withheld from medically unfit 
patients because comorbid conditions and age-related changes of organ function may increase the 
occurrence of sustained cytopenia, T-cell depletion, and opportunistic infections. 
If considered ineligible for fludarabine-based immunochemotherapy because of comorbidity or other 
age-related problems, CLL patients are frequently treated with the alkylating drug chlorambucil (Clb) or 
bendamustine. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) treatment guidelines for this patient 
population refer to Clb as the treatment standard. Although Clb is generally well tolerated, complete 
responses are rare, and the duration of remissions is usually shorter than 1.5 years 
About the product 
Obinutuzumab is a recombinant monoclonal humanised and glycoengineered Type II anti-CD20 antibody 
of the IgG1 isotype. It specifically targets the extracellular loop of the CD20 transmembrane antigen on 
the surface of non-malignant and malignant pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes, but not on haematopoietic 
stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. Glycoengineering of the Fc part of 
obinutuzumab results in higher affinity for FcɣRIII receptors on immune effector cells such as natural 
killer (NK) cells, macrophages and monocytes as compared to non-glycoengineered antibodies (SmPC, 
section 5.1; see Non-clinical aspects). 
Obinutuzumab is being developed for the treatment of various hematological malignancies. This 
application was seeking approval for obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil for previously 
untreated patients with CLL.

The sponsor applied for the following indication: Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is indicated 
for the treatment of patients with previously untreated CLL. The recommended indication for approval is: 
Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously 
untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and with comorbidities making them unsuitable for 
full-dose fludarabine based therapy (see SmPC, section 5.1). 
Gazyvaro should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced physician and in an 
environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see SmPC, section 4.2). 
Gazyvaro is for intravenous use. It should be given as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated line 
after dilution (see SmPC, section 6.6). Gazyvaro infusions should not be administered as an intravenous 
push or bolus.  
The duration of treatment is six treatment cycles, each of 28 day duration. The recommended dose of 
Gazyvaro is shown in Table 1.

Rate of infusion  
Administer at 25 mg/hr over 4 hours. Do not 
increase the infusion rate. 
Administer at 50 mg/hr.  
The rate of the infusion can be escalated in 
increments of 50 mg/hr every 30 minutes to a 
maximum rate of 400 mg/hr. 
Infusions can be started at a rate of 100 mg/hr and 
increased by 100 mg/hr increments every 
30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr. 
Management of IRRs may require temporary interruption, reduction in the rate of infusion, or treatment 
discontinuations of Gazyvaro as outlined below (SmPC, section 4.2; see also section 4.4). 
•  Grade 4 (life threatening): Infusion must be stopped and therapy must be permanently discontinued. 
•  Grade 3 (severe): Infusion must be temporarily stopped and symptoms treated. Upon resolution of 
symptoms, the infusion can be restarted at no more than half the previous rate (the rate being used 
at the time that the IRR occurred) and, if the patient does not experience any IRR symptoms, the 
infusion rate escalation can resume at the increments and intervals as appropriate for the treatment 
dose (see Table 2). The Day 1 (Cycle 1) infusion rate may be increased back up to 25 mg/hr after 1 
hour, but not increased further. The infusion must be stopped and therapy permanently discontinued 
if the patient experiences a second occurrence of a Grade 3 IRR.

•  Grade 1 2 (mild to moderate): The infusion rate must be reduced and symptoms treated. Infusion can 
be continued upon resolution of symptoms and, if the patient does not experience any IRR symptoms, 
the infusion rate escalation can resume at the increments and intervals as appropriate for the 
treatment dose (see Table 2). The Day 1 (Cycle 1) infusion rate may be increased back up to 25 mg/hr 
after 1 hour, but not increased further. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Legal basis 
The application for marketing authorisation through the centralised procedure for Gazyvaro 
(obinutuzumab) concentrate for solution for infusion, was submitted according to Article 8.3 of Directive 
2001/83/EC. The application is a complete and independent application, for a new active substance. 
Prior to initiating the Phase III program in CLL, Scientific Advice on the proposed design of study 
BO21004/CLL11 and the development plans to support registration of obinutuzumab was sought in 2009 
and follow-up in 2010 from CHMP. Overall consensus was reached on: 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
Design of Pivotal BO21004/CLL11 study. 
Overall design as a three-arm study with three primary pairwise comparisons 
Chlorambucil as an active control 
The use of investigator-assessed PFS as the primary endpoint in the BO21004/CLL11 protocol but 
Independent review Committee (IRC)-assessed PFS as the primary endpoint for registration 
purposes in the US 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for the BO21004/CLL three arm analysis and filing plan. 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indications: 
Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously 
untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (see section 5.1). 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is:  
Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously 
untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and with comorbidities making them unsuitable for 
full-dose fludarabine based therapy (see section 5.1). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Obinutuzumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody based on a human IgG1 (κ) framework directed 
against CD20 found on most malignant and benign B cells.  
The mechanism of action of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies involves a combination of (1) 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and phagocytosis (ADCC and ADCP) (2) 
caspase-independent apoptosis or direct cell death induction and (3) complement-dependent cytotoxicity 
(CDC) to different degrees. 
Therapeutic CD20 antibodies can be divided in two subclasses (Type I and Type II) based on the different 
mechanisms of depleting B-cells. Both subtypes recruit immune effector cells and mediate ADCC. Type I 
antibodies mediate potent CDC. In contrast, Type II antibodies such as obinutuzumab induce enhanced 
direct cell death while CDC activity is strongly reduced. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014

The recombinant antibody is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and consists of two heavy 
chains and two light chains with inter- and intra-chain disulfide bonds that are typical of IgG1 antibodies. 
The calculated molecular mass of intact obinutuzumab is 146 kDa (peptide chains only, with heavy chain 
C-terminal lysine residue, with heavy chain N-terminal glutamines). 
The CH2 domain of each heavy chain also has a single conserved glycosylation site predominantly with 
biantennary complex- and hybrid-type N-glycans with reduced levels of core-fucosylation. The production 
cell line for obinutuzumab is glycoengineered in order to obtain this modified glycosylation pattern with 
reduced levels of core-fucosylation. 
Obinutuzumab was derived by humanisation of the parental B-Ly1 mouse antibody and subsequent 
glycoengineering leading to a significantly increased FcγRIIIa binding mediated by a modified 
glycosylation pattern, which is related to enhanced ADCC.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Manufacture 
The active substance is manufactured at Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Nonnenwald 2, D-82377, Penzberg, 
Germany. 
Cell culture process 
Obinutuzumab is produced in a fed-batch process using a WCB as starting material. The antibody is 
secreted into the cell culture medium. 
For production of obinutuzumab, a vial of the WCB is thawed. The cells are then cultivated in shake flasks 
and bioreactors of increasing volumes.  
The production culture is harvested and filtered prior to purification of obinutuzumab. 
Cell culture conditions and in-process controls (IPCs) have been sufficiently described and are considered 
appropriate. 
Purification process 
The obinutuzumab purification process consists of a series of chromatography, viral inactivation, filtration 
and ultrafiltration/diafiltration steps. 
 Raw materials 
Development genetics 
The monoclonal IgG1 antibody obinutuzumab was derived and humanised from the original murine 
version B-Ly1. The antibody is expressed in CHO cells. The antibody genes were co-transfected together 
with genes encoding glycosylation modifying enzymes in order to engineer the oligosaccharide structure 
attached to the antibody. 
Cell banking system 
A two-tiered cell banking system of Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) was developed 
and maintained in accordance to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and ICH guidelines.  
Procedures followed for the preparation of the MCB and WCB were described. An extensive range of tests 
was performed for their characterisation, in accordance to ICH guidelines, including identity, viability, 
stability, presence of adventitious agents. 
Raw materials used in manufacture 
Raw materials used throughout the manufacture of obinutuzumab are carefully addressed.  
Process validation 
Development, evaluation, and verification of the obinutuzumab process were built upon a comprehensive 
science- and risk-based approach. This incorporates process and product understanding developed from 
obinutuzumab-specific  studies  as  well  as  platform  knowledge  gained  from  similar  molecules  and 
processes. 
Manufacturing process development 
During pharmaceutical development, three different active substance manufacturing processes were 
established for obinutuzumab.

Characterisation 
Physicochemical characterisation: 
Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (ESI-MS) analysis confirmed that the molecular mass is in 
accordance with the predicted mass from the amino acid sequence of obinutuzumab. The mass for 
deglycosylated non-reduced obinutuzumab is approximately 146 kDa.  
Tryptic peptide mapping confirmed the primary structure. 
The N-termini of the light chain and heavy chain were confirmed by peptide map analysis.  
All disulfide linked peptides were identified by liquid chromatography − mass spectrometry (LC-MS) 
analysis of non-reduced obinutuzumab.  
Free sulfhydryl groups were measured using a reduced LC-MS peptide map from tryptic digests after 
derivatisation of free sulfhydryl groups in native obinutuzumab.  
The extent of glycation was assessed using ESI-MS.  
Oxidation was assessed using a tryptic peptide map.  
Deamidation products were assessed using a tryptic peptide map with MS detection.  
Obinutuzumab was analysed by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) to 
determine the amount of high-molecular weight species (HMWS) and low-molecular weight species 
(LMWS).  
Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) was performed for both reduced 
and non-reduced samples.  
Ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (IE-HPLC) was performed to investigate charge 
variants.  
The higher order structure of obinutuzumab was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 
spectroscopy. 
Biological characterisation: 
Biological characterisation of obinutuzumab included: 
• Potency by bioassay (ADCC) 
• FcRn Binding 
• Direct Cell Death Assay 
Variants and impurities 
The impurities of obinutuzumab active substance are controlled either by the process or by release testing 
and relevant IPCs. The process- and product-related impurities of obinutuzumab active substance are: 
- Product variants: size-related variants, charge-related variants, acidic variants, glycosylation variants; 
- Adventitious agents: endotoxins, bacteria and fungi, mycoplasma, adventitious viruses, mouse minute 
virus (MMV); 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 15/123 
 
 
 
 
 
• Process related impurities such as Protein A, CHO host cell proteins (CHOP), host cell DNA and various 
raw materials.  
It was found that for all obinutuzumab active substance batches tested, the level of these impurities was 
within the acceptable limits. 
Specification 
The release specifications for obinutuzumab active substance have been suitably justified and are 
supported by consistent data from multiple lots. The specifications contain test for pharmacopoeial 
methods as well as specific methods to ensure sufficient safety and quality with respect to identity, purity, 
quantity and potency. 
Stability 
The design of the stability program, including the testing intervals and temperature storage conditions, 
are in accordance to current guidelines. The tests chosen are a subset of tests from the release 
specifications selected for stability-indicating properties.  
On the basis of the stability data provided, a shelf life of 36 months is claimed and is found acceptable. 
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  a  liquid,  clear  to  opalescent,  colourless  to  slightly  brownish  aqueous  solution 
composed of 25 mg/mL obinutuzumab, with the following excipients:  
- L-histidine/L-histidine hydrochloride buffer; 
- Trehalose dihydrate; 
- Poloxamer 188.  
Gazyvaro does not contain antimicrobial preservatives. 
Each  50  mL  vial  contains  1000  mg  obinutuzumab.  The  concentrate  is  diluted  in  0.9%  (w/v)  sodium 
chloride solution prior to administration. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process of the finished product includes the following steps: 
- Thawing the active substance;  
- The thawed bulk is transferred through a sterilised 0.22 μm membrane filter into a steam-sterilised 
stainless steel storage vessel.  
- From the storage vessel, the filtered finished product solution is sterile filtered (0.22 μm) in-line within 
a closed system directly into the filler. 
- The finished product solution is filled into the sterilised, depyrogenated vials by means of sterilised filling 
equipment under laminar flow in a Grade A environment. The filled vials are conveyed to the stoppering 
unit where they are stoppered with sterilised stoppers. 
- Filled and stoppered vials are crimped with aluminium seals fitted with plastic flip-off cap. 
Capped vials are stored at 2°C - 8°C. 
CHMP assessment report

- Filled and capped vials are 100% visually inspected by means of manual or automatic inspection. After 
the inspection process, the vials are quarantined and stored at 2°C - 8°C. 
Product specification 
Appropriate specifications for obinutuzumab finished product have been developed. The specifications 
contain tests for pharmacopoeial methods as well as specific methods. 
Stability of the product 
Real-time and accelerated stability studies were initiated in accordance to ICH guidelines and per protocol 
to monitor the time-temperature stability of cGMP lots of finished product. On the basis of the data 
provided, the claimed shelf life for the finished product is 36 months at 2-8°C. 
Adventitious agents 
Safety in relation to non-viral and viral adventitious agents has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Acceptable virus removal and inactivation capacity of the obinutuzumab active substance manufacturing 
process have been demonstrated.  
Post-Approval Lifecycle Management Plan 
The post-approval lifecycle management (PALM) plan described in the dossier specifies how the Applicant 
will: 
•  Monitor  the  obinutuzumab  process  and  product  quality  attributes  to  ensure  that  both  remain 
within a controlled state post-approval; 
•  Update  the  obinutuzumab  control  system  as  necessary  based  on  further  process  and  product 
knowledge; 
•  Manage changes to process parameter targets within the design space. 
2.2.4.  Overview of the Quality by Design approach 
The standard elements in Modules 2 and 3 supporting a recombinant antibody filing are present in the 
obinutuzumab dossier. In addition, the use of risk assessments and decision tools is described, providing 
transparency into the definition of Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs), Critical Process Parameters (CPPs), 
acceptable process parameter ranges, the active substance and finished product control systems and 
process monitoring. These tools have been developed as part of an integrated risk management system 
building on concepts expressed in ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10, and key decision criteria were calibrated using 
information from the Applicant's approved products. This systematic approach to risk assessment is 
based on an understanding of the connections between the product quality and the manufacturing 
process and rests strongly on platform knowledge for recombinant antibody products manufactured by 
the Applicant.  
The decision-making framework for identification of obinutuzumab CQAs and CPPs, as well as the 
development of an overall control strategy, are depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Approach to Implementing Quality by Design for obinutuzumab 
Quality Target Product Profile 
Obinutuzumab is an IgG1 antibody made in a manner typical of the Applicant's platform monoclonal 
antibody process, using IgG1 frameworks, cell culture production host cells, process conditions, 
operational strategies, and the number and sequence of downstream unit operations similar to those used 
for several of the Applicant's licensed antibodies. Knowledge derived from this process and product 
platform experience, along with other relevant process development knowledge, obinutuzumab product 
understanding (product characterisation based on prior knowledge), and relevant scientific literature, 
informed the Risk Ranking and Filtering (RRF) assessments that guided the identification of a Quality 
Target Product Profile (QTTP) and CQAs and the design of process characterisation studies. 
Quality Attributes 
Quality attributes are divided into the following assessment categories: product variants, process-related 
impurities, raw materials, leachables, adventitious agents, composition and strength and other attributes 
specific to the finished product (table 3). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 18/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3: Categories of Obinutuzumab Quality Attributes 
Product Variants and Process-Related Impurities 
Criticality of product variants and process-related impurities was assessed using an RRF approach and 
acceptance criteria were established for CQAs as applicable. The CQA RRF approach involved assigning 
both impact and uncertainty scores to each quality attribute.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 19/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Impact  Scores  were  assigned  based  on  the  magnitude  or  severity  of  the  effect  on  four  components: 
biological activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity and safety. 
Uncertainty  scores  were  based  on  the  level  of  knowledge  of  the  particular  quality  attribute.  Product 
variants were assessed on a product-specific basis to account for the unique modifications, mechanism of 
action, route of administration, non-clinical and clinical experience, in vitro studies and other factors that 
influence potential risk to patients. Prior knowledge was applied as applicable; in part to assess risk for 
process-related impurities in products manufactured using this same platform process. 
The relative risk score for each attribute is obtained by multiplying the impact and uncertainty scores  
Raw materials and leachables 
For raw materials, a comparison of each estimated daily intake before downstream clearance (EDI0) with 
its corresponding acceptable daily exposure (ADE) was used to identify obinutuzumab raw material that 
pose a potential toxicity risk. ADE are based on toxicology data and EDIs are based on the assumption 
that no clearance occurs downstream of where the raw material is introduced. 
Raw materials with EDI0 > ADE are considered as CQAs. They required further assessment which 
demonstrated downstream clearance in the obinutuzumab manufacturing process.  
Leachables are related to compounds that leach into the active substance or finished product from 
elastomeric or plastic components of process equipment or the container and closure system. The 
approach for identification of specific leachables as CQAs was dependent on whether a specific compound 
can be detected. No leachables were detected for obinutuzumab. Based on these results, leachables were 
not classified as CQAs for obinutuzumab. 
Other CQAs 
The attributes adventitious agents (viral purity, microbiological purity, and endotoxins) and active 
substance and finished product composition and strength (protein content, osmolality, pH, appearance 
(colour, opalescence, clarity), L-histidine content, trehalose content, and poloxamer 188 content as well 
as the finished product specific attributes (subvisible particles, visible particles, extractable volume and 
sterility) were classified as CQAs without further assessment.  
CQA acceptance criteria 
Acceptance criteria are established for attributes which have been identified as “critical”, have been 
observed at quantifiable levels, and exhibit values outside the range of the reference material. The 
acceptance criteria for CQAs that have an impact on safety or immunogenicity were based on the 
information available from the obinutuzumab clinical studies or information on other clinical or marketed 
products considering indication, treatment regime and patient population. General information on safety 
and immunogenicity from literature was also considered when setting acceptance criteria for 
obinutuzumab variants that potentially can impact safety/immunogenicity.  
Site- and Scale-Independent Process Validation 
Overview 
Site- and scale-independent process evaluation and verification studies were performed for the active 
substance in a stepwise approach. Process understanding developed during process and product 
development, platform knowledge, and scientific and engineering principles were initially brought 
together using a risk assessment tool.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 20/123 
 
 
 
 
 
For each unit operation, process parameters potentially impacting CQAs (potential CPPs [pCPPs]) or KPIs 
were investigated in univariate and/or multivariate studies.  
Subsequently, linkage studies were performed to understand the behaviour of the overall process under 
worst-case conditions in order to assess the cumulative, process-wide impact on the CQAs. 
The objective of this progression of studies was to formally identify CPPs and non-CPPs, further refine 
process parameter acceptable ranges, referred to as multivariate acceptable ranges (MARs) and define a 
process-wide design space.  
Statistical modelling 
Generally, process data was described using means, sample standard deviations and coefficients of 
variation. Means and standard deviations were interpreted in relation to the CQA target ranges or 
practically significant difference (PSD) limits. Furthermore, the impact of different process parameters on 
each CQA was analysed.  
Qualification of scale-down models 
Qualified scale-down models of the cell culture and purification unit operations were used for process 
evaluation studies in order to predict performance at manufacturing scale.  
Linkage studies 
Linkage studies were performed for CQAs that are affected by more than one unit operation. From the 
multivariate regression models, worst-case conditions were calculated to identify the parameter settings 
leading to the worst-case CQA value. These worst-case conditions of the unit operations were used for the 
linkage studies.  
Identification of critical process parameters 
A parameter is identified as a CPP when its variation has a relevant impact on at least one CQA. The 
Applicant expressed criticality as a quantitative metric, the impact ratio. 
Based on the impact ratio, the process parameters are classified as follows: 
• Non-CPP: 
Process parameters with a low impact ratio are considered to be non-CPPs.  
• Low-impact CPP: 
 Process parameters with a medium impact ratio were categorised as low-impact CPP. 
• High-impact CPP: 
 Process parameters with a high impact ratio were categorised as high-impact CPPs. 
Design Space 
Based on the outcomes of the process evaluation studies and the linkage studies the process-wide design 
space for the active substance was defined. It includes all the unit operations, the process parameters 
describing  operation  of  each  of  the  unit  operations,  and  the  raw  materials  used.  The  design  space  is 
limited by the multivariate acceptable ranges (MAR) for all process parameters (CPPs and non-CPPs).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 21/123 
 
 
 
 
 
Changes  to  the  target/set  point  for  all  process  parameters  within  their  MARs  are  considered  to  be 
movement within the design space. Changes to the MARs of CPPs or non-CPPs would be considered to be 
movement outside the design space. 
Control Strategy 
Overview 
The approach to defining the control strategy for the active substance and finished product is based on the 
enhanced process knowledge and product understanding enabled by the QbD approach. For identified 
quality attributes, several risk assessments were performed to enable development of a suitable control 
system, including: 
• Determination of acceptance criteria for CQAs, if applicable (see above); 
• Evaluation of the ratio of the estimated daily intake (EDI0) to the acceptable daily exposure (ADE) for 
raw materials (see above); 
• Evaluation of the appropriate attribute testing strategy (ATS), taking into account process impact and 
stability impact (see below); 
• Robustness assessment of the proposed testing strategy (see below). 
These  risk  assessments  were  performed  for  all  quality  attributes,  including  those  determined  to  be 
non-critical and those that require testing to meet compendial requirements. 
The integral part of the overall control system is the ATS, which comprises the elements of batch release, 
release-relevant in-process control, stability testing, and the monitoring program. 
Process impact score 
The process impact score is used, in combination with the CQA impact score to generate an ATS score for 
the active substance and finished product manufacturing processes, which is used to define the overall 
attribute testing strategy for each CQA (see below). 
The process impact score represents an estimation of the residual risk that a CQA could exceed its 
acceptable production range defined as CQA-TR when the process is operated within its acceptable 
ranges. 
A procedure was developed for determining the process impact score reflecting increasing criticality.  
Stability impact score 
The stability impact score is used in combination with the CQA impact score to generate an ATS score for 
active substance and finished product that assesses whether or not testing of an attribute should be 
performed as part of the stability program. The overall process flow for determining the stability impact 
score is summarised in the form of a decision tree.   
The stability impact score is determined for each quality attribute.  
Attribute testing strategy risk assessment 
The ATS RRF tool multiplies, for all quality attributes, the CQA impact score with either the process impact 
score or the stability impact score. The highest impact score is used for each CQA. 
 The scoring results in a recommendation of the following testing strategies: 
• 
For high ATS scores: Control system testing for the attribute is required.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 22/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
For medium ATS scores: Monitoring testing (periodic or continual) is required for these attributes. For 
low ATS scores: No testing is required.  
The ATS RRF assessment is performed four times: for active substance manufacture, active substance 
storage, finished product manufacture, and finished product storage. 
Robustness assessment of the attribute testing strategy 
Once the attribute testing strategy has been proposed for each attribute, and the appropriate test 
methods and limits have been defined, a robustness assessment is performed on this testing strategy. 
This assessment is performed for all quality attributes in order to evaluate the proper control of the 
attribute in the defined ATS. The assessment ensures evaluation of the application of the ATS to molecule 
and process-specific attributes, and adds evaluation of the capability and suitability of the available 
analytical methods.  
Post-Approval Lifecycle Management Plan 
The post-approval lifecycle management (PALM) plan described in the dossier specifies how the Applicant 
will: 
•  Monitor  the  obinutuzumab  process  and  product  quality  attributes  to  ensure  that  both  remain 
within a controlled state post-approval; 
•  Update  the  obinutuzumab  control  system  as  necessary  based  on  further  process  and  product 
knowledge; 
•  Manage changes to process parameter targets within the design space. 
Monitoring program  
The obinutuzumab monitoring program can be adapted during the product lifecycle. 
Monitoring activities for obinutuzumab comprise routine elements and additional elements which are 
required by the QbD approach used for the development of the control system. 
Management of process parameters within the design space 
Changes within the design space will be managed in the Applicant’s quality system.  
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
ACTIVE SUBSTANCE 
Raw materials 
Raw materials used throughout the manufacture of obinutuzumab are carefully addressed in relation to 
their possible impact. Objections concerning raw material variability were well addressed with the 
Applicant´s Day 120 and Day 180 responses.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Appropriate in-process controls (IPCs) are in place for the obinutuzumab active substance manufacturing 
process. 
Process validation and/or Evaluation  
Process verification was conducted on full-scale and at site consecutive batches. All acceptance criteria 
were met. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 23/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consistency for all obinutuzumab active substance batches manufactured by the commercial scale has 
been verified by manufacturing scale data at commercial site. All batches were produced in accordance 
with the acceptance ranges stated in the dossier. All acceptance criteria were met, supporting that the 
manufacturing process is robust and consistent. 
Data for the removal of raw materials qualified as CQAs were provided and consistent removal has been 
demonstrated.  
Hold times of intermediates have been carefully studied and supported by several multivariate studies.  
The data provided by the Applicant support the conclusion that the obinutuzumab cell culture, harvest 
and purification process, covered by the proposed design space, is capable of producing product of 
acceptable and consistent quality.  
Design Space 
Quality by Design (QbD) principles have been applied during the development of obinutuzumab. The 
design space of obinutuzumab includes all the unit operations, the process parameters describing the 
operation of each of the unit operations, and the raw materials used. The design   space is limited by the 
Multivariate Acceptable Ranges (MARs) for all process parameters (CPPs and non-CPPs) described in the 
dossier. Changes to the targets for all process parameters within their MARs are considered to be 
movement within the design space. Changes to the MARs of CPPs or non-CPPs would be considered to be 
movement outside the design space. 
Even though a huge quantity of data was provided by the Applicant, a sum of uncertainties at all steps of 
the building of the design space led to doubts, at Day 120, on its suitability.  
Following the Applicant´s Day 120 and Day 180 responses, the management of remaining uncertainties 
was sufficiently addressed.  
Especially the final proposed control strategy, which does take into account remaining uncertainties led to 
the overall conclusion that the claimed design space is considered acceptable.  
Manufacturing process development 
The changes introduced to the obinutuzumab manufacturing process during its development are 
sufficiently detailed in the dossier. Three processes have been used in the non-clinical and clinical studies. 
Pivotal clinical studies have used material produced by the final process. Overall, comparability has been 
demonstrated.  
Characterisation 
Obinutuzumab is considered thoroughly characterised in relation to structural, physicochemical- and 
biological properties. The methods used are considered state of the art.  
Obinutuzumab is a Type II CD20 monoclonal antibody, whereas rituximab is a Type 1 monoclonal 
antibody. The two subtypes differ in their mechanism of depleting B-cells. The mechanism of action of 
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies including rituximab and obinutuzumab involves a combination of (1) 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and phagocytosis (ADCC and ADCP) (2) 
caspase-independent apoptosis or direct cell death induction and (3) complement-dependent cytotoxicity 
(CDC) to different degrees. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 24/123 
 
 
 
 
 
Both subtypes (Type I and II) recruit immune effector cells and mediate ADCC. Type I antibodies such as 
rituximab mediate potent CDC. In contrast, Type II antibodies such as obinutuzumab induce enhanced 
direct cell death while CDC activity is strongly reduced. The latter statement has been further justified by 
the Applicant in their Day 120 responses. The conclusion drawn by the Applicant, that the obinutuzumab 
bioactivity is considered not to rely on CDC, is endorsed. 
CQA assessment 
Detailed information and careful explanations are provided on the Risk Ranking and Filtering (RRF) tool 
used to define quality attributes of obinutuzumab as critical or not. 
The RRF tool used for the attribute criticality designation is acceptable. It is considered that a 
conservative approach has been taken by the Applicant in the criticality assessment of product-related 
variants and process-related impurities. Raw materials and leachables as well as so-called “obligatory” 
CQAs have all been sufficiently addressed.  
The overall approach applied for identification of CQAs is generally acceptable. Most CQAs for 
obinutuzumab are typical of monoclonal antibodies produced in CHO cells.  
Control of active substance 
The test methods and acceptance criteria included in the obinutuzumab active substance release 
specification and the release-relevant in-process controls are in general acceptable. Concerns raised at 
Day 120 and Day 180 were considered resolved. 
The control strategy for obinutuzumab active substance is well described and justified. Like the process 
development, characterisation and validation, the control strategy is also developed by a systematic QbD 
approach. Attributes to be tested are identified by an Attribute Testing Strategy (ATS) tool.  
Development of the attribute testing strategy is a consecutive process comprising the following key steps: 
CQA identification, establishment of CQA-ACs, outcomes of the process evaluation studies as well as 
stability studies against predefined limits, the probability to exceed the CQA-TRs leading to the definition 
of a proposed attribute testing strategy, and finally a robustness assessment on the proposed testing 
strategy, thereby generating the final attribute testing strategy.  
The control strategy does not only take into account the influence that a single CQA may have on the 
bioactivity, PK, safety and immunogenicity, it also defines a total acceptable change for the product as a 
whole: the specification for the individual CQAs also takes into account the total “sum of change”.  
The proposed control strategy is considered conservative and following the additional information 
provided in the Day 120 responses, it is considered acceptable.  
The CQAs identified for inclusion in the specification are considered acceptable as well as their acceptance 
criteria. For some CQAs, the acceptance criteria are slightly above the clinical experience. However, it is 
sufficiently justified, for example by experience with other relevant monoclonal antibody products or by 
the WHO recommendation.  
Finally a number of CQAs are tested, without further control strategy assessment, due to their nature, by 
which regulatory testing is obligatory (for example Ph. Eur. requirements). This is acceptable and did not 
call for comments. 
CHMP assessment report

Stability 
On the basis of the primary stability data derived from registration batches and representative data, a 
shelf life of 36 months is considered acceptable for the commercial obinutuzumab active substance. 
FINISHED PRODUCT 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Thorough manufacturing process development has been conducted for each of the steps in the process. 
Development studies were conducted using worst-case process parameter settings, i.e. beyond normal 
operation ranges, or based on scientific principles and/or platform knowledge. Studies were either full 
scale studies and / or small-scale studies. 
Control of finished product 
The specification, including the acceptance criteria, were developed using the enhanced understanding 
that QbD offers. A QbD approach has been applied to develop the control strategy for obinutuzumab. The 
general assessment of quality attributes for the finished product control system is performed identically to 
that performed for the active substance. 
Stability 
The proposed shelf life of Gazyvaro finished product is 36 months at 2-8°C. On the basis of the stability 
data provided, this shelf life is considered acceptable. The proposed in-use shelf life is also acceptable. 
Adventitious agents safety evaluation 
Safety in relation to non-viral and viral adventitious agents has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Acceptable virus removal and inactivation capacity of the obinutuzumab active substance manufacturing 
process have been demonstrated.  
Post-Approval Lifecycle Management (PALM) Plan 
The PALM plan is described in the dossier which specifies how the obinutuzumab process and product 
quality attributes will be monitored, how changes within the design space will be handled, and how update 
of the control system will be implemented based on further process and product knowledge. 
Overall, the PALM plan is considered acceptable.  
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Overall, the quality of Gazyvaro is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance are adequately 
described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its 
physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described 
and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been 
sufficiently assured.

The overall Quality of Gazyvaro is considered acceptable. 
2.2.7.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended two points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical testing strategy was designed to demonstrate and characterize the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics, and toxicology of obinutuzumab. All pivotal toxicology studies were 
conducted using IV administration. Obinutuzumab binds to Cynomolgus monkey (but not rodent) CD20 
with an affinity and ADCC potency similar to that of human CD20; consequently, the Cynomolgus monkey 
was considered the only appropriate species in which to assess the safety of obinutuzumab. Pivotal 
toxicology/toxicokinetics studies were performed according to the GLP principles. 
EMA Scientific Advice was sought to confirm the acceptability of assessing safety pharmacology as part of 
the repeat dose toxicity studies, of avoiding standard genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies, on the 
6-month duration of repeat-dose toxicity studies, and to agree on the design of reproductive toxicity 
studies.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Epitope mapping and crystal structure analysis of the CD20-obinutuzumab complex showed that 
obinutuzumab binds CD20 in a different orientation than rituximab. While the epitopes for rituximab and 
obinutuzumab are not identical they overlap (Niederfellner et al. 2011). In vitro, obinutuzumab and 
rituximab competed for binding to CD20 (Report 1025130, 1025238). Obinutuzumab exhibited bivalent 
binding to the CD20 epitope (Report 1043641). Obinutuzumab and rituximab had comparable affinity to 
CD20 expressed on the surface of a panel of B-cell lymphoma cell lines (Report 1025238). 
In contrast to rituximab and ofatumumab, which carry a human wildtype and non-glycoengineered and 
thus fucosylated IgG1 Fc portion, obinutuzumab has been glycoengineered to produce an afucosylated Fc 
region that substantially enhances the affinity of this antibody for both the FcγRIIIA-158F and 
FcγRIIIA-158V variants.

Figure 2: The structure and topology of CD20 and the epitopes recognized by ofatumumab, rituximab and 
obinutuzumab (GA101) (From Klein et al. 2013). 
Most existing anti-CD20 antibodies, including rituximab, veltuzumab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab, are 
Type I anti-CD20 antibodies. Type I antibodies induce a translocation of CD20 into large lipid 
microdomains or ‘lipid rafts’ within the plasma membrane upon binding, leading to 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).  
Obinutuzumab, like tositumomab, can be classified as a type II CD20 antibody. Obinutuzumab did not 
induce accumulation of CD20 upon antibody binding (Report 1025127) and was more potent than Type I 
antibodies in inducing homotypic adhesion and direct cell death (Report 1038406).  
Obinutuzumab displayed reduced CDC relative to rituximab, in particular, in the presence of physiological 
levels of human immunoglobulins (Report 1025235). Obinutuzumab had a diminished binding capacity 
for C1q compared to rituximab (Report 1053171) and ofatumumab (Report 1043692). While complement 
in serum blocked Natural Killer cell (NK) activation induced by rituximab, it had no effect on NK cell 
activation induced by obinutuzumab (Report 1053171).  
Obinutuzumab (1, 10 µg/mL) was superior to rituximab in inducing early-stage (Annexin V positive) and 
late-stage (Annexin V/propidium iodide positive) apoptosis in a panel of CD20 expressing B-cell 
lymphoma cell lines (Report 1025131) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patient 
samples (Report 1025237). Cell-death induction by obinutuzumab required bivalent binding and is 
independent of both the Fc region and the glycoengineering of the Fc region (Reports 1025131, 1025240, 
1043691, 1038406 and 1043692). Obinutuzumab-induced cell death was dependent on actin 
reorganization and lysosome disruption, could be abrogated by inhibitors of actin polymerization, and was 
independent of Bcl-2 overexpression and caspase activation (Alduaij et al. 2011). 
The efficacy of rituximab was higher in patients homozygous for the “high-affinity” allele of FcγRIIIa, that 
is characterized by a valine at position 158 (FcγRIIIa[V158]), than in patients heterozygous or 
homozygous for the “low-affinity” allele of FcγRIIIa, which has a phenylalanine residue at this position 
(FcγRIIIa[F158]) and a lower affinity for IgG (Koene et al., 1997). Obinutuzumab binding (K D of 55.5 nM) 
to the high-affinity FcγRIIIa[V158] receptor was around 12-fold stronger than for rituximab (K D of 666 
nM). Moreover, obinutuzumab displayed 4.5-fold higher affinity towards the low affinity FcγRIIIa[F158] 
receptor than rituximab (KD (obinutuzumab) 457 nM, KD (rituximab) 2070 nM) (Report 1025340).  
Obinutuzumab and rituximab displayed comparable affinity for the FcγIIIb receptor (Report 1053422), 
the FcγIIb receptor (Report 1034799), and the FcRn receptor (Report 1053425).

Obinutuzumab was associated with a significantly enhanced potency in ADCC assays using NK cells as 
compared to rituximab. Overall, obinutuzumab exhibited approximately 5- to 100-fold enhanced ADCC 
potency against a panel of B cell lymphoma cell lines in comparison to rituximab (Reports 1043692 and 
1025241). However, in Study 1038388, no evidence of obinutuzumab- or rituximab-mediated ADCC with 
either resting or M-CSF-activated monocytes was seen in a special 3D co-culture model. In subsequent 
studies, it was investigated whether obinutuzumab triggers macrophage-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) 
and cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Report 1053079). In the Cell ELISA assays, the observed superiority of 
obinutuzumab over rituximab and ofatumumab in monocyte- or macrophage-mediated elimination of 
tumor cells was primarily due to a contribution of antibody-mediated direct effects and ADCP, but only to 
a minor extent due to ADCC (1053079, Herter et al., submitted, 2013b).  
Follow up experiments using both monocyte and macrophage populations showed that monocyte or 
macrophage-mediated ADCC is an inefficient process, whereas phagocytosis occurs rapidly and is more 
efficient (Herter et al., submitted, 2013b).  
While obinutuzumab, non-glycoengineered obinutuzumab and rituximab displayed comparable binding to 
monocyte-derived M1 and M2c macrophage subsets in the absence of competing endogenous IgGs, 
obinutuzumab displayed superior binding in the presence of competing immunoglobulins. Moreover, the 
phagocytic activity and nitric oxide release of M1 and in particular M2c macrophage subsets treated with 
glycoengineered obinutuzumab was superior to that of its wild-type non-glycoengineered counterpart in 
the presence of competing immunoglobulins. 
Obinutuzumab was associated with superior depletion of normal B cells from blood of healthy volunteers 
as well as of malignant B cells from blood in comparison to rituximab (Report 1049394; Report 1049395; 
Report 1025239). At concentrations above 1 µg/mL, obinutuzumab was superior to rituximab as well as 
alemtuzumab in depleting CLL cells in patient whole blood samples (n=23, Report 1053423). The 
maximal effect obtained was a 55% reduction in CD19+ cells following 8 hours incubation with 10 µg/mL 
obinutuzumab. The effect of different degree of non-fucosylation (5-50%) in the IgGs heavy chain has on 
B cell depletion was evaluated in whole blood of healthy human donors. A stepwise improvement of B cell 
depleting potency was observed with increasing non-fucosylation which reached a plateau at around 20% 
non-fucosylation. The level of N-glycans lacking core-fucose ranges from 42.0−48.4% in the 
obinutuzumab registration batches. V 
The Cynomolgus monkey was considered an appropriate species for the toxicologic assessment of 
obinutuzumab. CD20 expression on Cynomolgus monkey B cells was found to be about 2-fold higher than 
on human B cells (Report 1025343). The determination of relative binding affinity showed that 
obinutuzumab bound with comparable nanomolar affinity to human CD20 on normal B cells and to CD20 
on B cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Cynomolgus monkeys (Reports 
1025242 and 1025343). 
The anti-tumour efficacy of obinutuzumab was evaluated in numerous xenograft studies performed in 
female SCID beige mice. IV Q7D obinutuzumab displayed superior anti-tumour efficacy in SCID mice 
carrying tumours derived from SUDHL-4 DLBCL, OCI-Ly-18 NHL, Z138 MCL, RL NHL and WSU-DLCL2 B 
cell lymphoma cell lines when compared to rituximab. Comparable anti-tumour efficacy was seen in the 
Raji NHL xenograft model. A significant effect was observed in small as well as large tumours and 
following other treatment schedules.

Second line treatment with obinutuzumab of advanced xenografts was able to control SU-DHL-4 
progression in the presence of residual amounts of rituximab whereas rituximab treated tumours were 
refractory and did not respond to rituximab therapy alone any longer (Report 1029348). The anti-tumour 
activity of obinutuzumab as second line treatment to rituximab was observed in other studies in the 
SU-DHL-4 xenograft model (Reports 1038394, 1051515) but not in a mouse xenograft model with RL NHL 
tumours resistant to rituximab (Report 1049396). 
In Cynomolgus monkeys, obinutuzumab appeared to be more active at depleting B-cells than rituximab 
(Report 10301398; Report 1030199 Report 1035992). Vaccination studies in huCD20 mice and 
Cynomolgus monkeys showed that the enhanced efficacy in terms of B-cell depletion of obinutuzumab 
translated into stronger suppression of de novo antibody responses, but left the protective humoral 
memory responses intact (Report 1053638). 
No specific secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted. In vitro tissue cross reactivity 
studies were conducted with obinutuzumab using a full panel of human and Cynomolgus monkey tissues 
(Reports 1024158, 1024159). Expected obinutuzumab-specific membrane staining was present in 
resident lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues (mammary gland, GALT in the small intestine and stomach, 
lymph node, spleen, thymus, and tonsil), lymphocytes or hematopoietic cells in bone marrow, and 
trafficking lymphocytes in other tissues (thyroid). Similar binding patterns were seen with obinutuzumab 
in the Cynomolgus monkey tissue study. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No specific secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted. In vitro tissue cross reactivity 
studies were conducted with obinutuzumab using a full panel of human and Cynomolgus monkey tissues 
(Reports 1024158, 1024159). Expected obinutuzumab-specific membrane staining was present in 
resident lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues (mammary gland, GALT in the small intestine and stomach, 
lymph node, spleen, thymus, and tonsil), lymphocytes or hematopoietic cells in bone marrow, and 
trafficking lymphocytes in other tissues (thyroid). Similar binding patterns were seen with obinutuzumab 
in the Cynomolgus monkey tissue study. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The potential effect of obinutuzumab on CNS, respiratory and cardiovascular systems was evaluated as 
part of the IV 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys (Report 1036190). No 
treatment-related effects on neurobehavioral parameters, respiration rate or blood pressure were noted 
during the scheduled dosing or recovery phase assessments. No rhythm abnormalities or qualitative ECG 
changes attributed to obinutuzumab were observed on Day 78 or 169 of the dosing phase or Day 254 of 
the recovery phase as part of the qualitative assessment of the ECGs. IV administration of obinutuzumab 
was not associated with electrocardiographic evidence of cardiotoxicity or arrhythmogenesis or effects on 
blood pressure when evaluated as part of the 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys (Report 1024830).  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Using isolated human PBMCs pre-incubated with 5 nM or 5 μM chlorambucil, no impact on the ADCC 
function of obinutuzumab was observed (Report 1050168). In the Z138 xenograft tumour model, 
obinutuzumab (1 mg/kg) in combination with chlorambucil (4 mg/kg) resulted in superior efficacy 
compared with obinutuzumab monotherapy or the combination of rituximab and chlorambucil (Report 
1043607).

The applicant also submitted a number of studies addressing the anti-tumour activity of obinutuzumab in 
combination with various regimens in SCID mice tumour xenograft models  Including cyclophosphamide, 
cyclophosphamide/vincristine, doxorubicin, bendamustine, fludarabine, rituximab (Reports 1029351, 
1029347, 1034644, 1036132, 1025317; data not shown). In vitro prednisolone (1-100 µg/mL) 
decreased ADCC and NK activity (Report 1027588).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Validated ELISA assays with colorimetric detection were applied for the quantification of obinutuzumab 
and anti-obinutuzumab antibodies (ADAs) in Cynomolgus monkey serum. The performance of the assays 
is considered adequate. 
Single dose studies were conducted in male mice and Cynomolgus monkeys. Following IV administration, 
obinutuzumab half-life was 5 and 12 days in mice administered 1 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. In 
Cynomolgus monkeys, the half-life varied from 7 to 8 days following IV treatment with 1 and 10 mg/kg 
obinutuzumab while the half-life was 2-3 days after SC treatment with 20 mg/kg obinutuzumab. The 
volume of distribution in mice and monkeys were small and approximately equal to the vascular volume. 
After repeated dosing (4-week SC, 13- and 26-week IV) to monkeys, the systemic exposures generally 
increased in a dose-proportional manner. The drug accumulation ranged from 2- to 3-fold at the end of 
the studies. No gender differences were apparent. Formation of ADAs was confirmed in all three studies 
and was associated with a more rapid clearance of obinutuzumab (Reports 1024838, 1024830, and 
1036190). 
The in vivo distribution of obinutuzumab has not been studied (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
The Vss values indicated limited tissue distribution of obinutuzumab in animals and were consistent with 
the value (Vss of 6.62 L/person, 94.6 mL/kg for a 70-kg person) reported for rituximab in humans (Dirks 
and Meibohm 2010). Monkeys were the only relevant non-clinical responder species tested. 
Obinutuzumab can cross the blood-placental barrier in monkeys as shown in an enhanced pre- and 
post-natal development study (ePPND) (Report 1045612).  
No specific metabolism studies were performed for obinutuzumab. The expected consequence of 
metabolism of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals is the degradation to small peptides and individual 
amino acids (ICH S6). In the disposition of mAbs, the FcRn receptor serves as a salvage receptor 
regulating mAb and/or endogenous IgGs catabolism. Obinutuzumab was shown to have similar binding 
affinity to the human and cynomolgus FcRn. FcRn could recycle a certain amount of obinutuzumab back 
to circulation, resulting in long terminal t1/2 in both monkeys and humans. 
No specific excretion studies were performed for obinutuzumab in accordance with ICH S6 guideline. 
Secretion of obinutuzumab in milk appeared to be very limited in monkeys based on the result from the 
ePPND study (Report 1045612). 
No dedicated nonclinical drug interaction study has been performed with obinutuzumab (see discussion 
on non-clinical aspects).

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No dedicated single-dose toxicity studies were performed with obinutuzumab (see discussion on 
non-clinical aspects).  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies applying weekly dosing were conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys (Table 6). 
The route of application was IV (9, 13 and 26-weeks duration) and SC (4-week), thus reflecting the 
clinical route of administration in the pivotal 26-week study. A 37-week treatment free period was 
included after the 13 week and 26 week IV studies, respectively.   
No off-target toxicity was observed in Cynomolgus monkeys following IV and SC administration of 
obinutuzumab at AUC exposures up to 6-fold those observed in humans following administration of the 
maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg. 
Obinutuzumab at doses ≥1 mg/kg induced B cell depletion in peripheral blood, lymph nodes and spleen. 
By the end of a 37-week recovery period, the level of peripheral B cells varied among the treated animals 
and represented from 7% to 152% of baseline values. Following initiation of treatment, a transient 
decrease in NK cell levels was observed.  
In two cases an anaphylactoid response was observed post-dose and in one of the cases, the incident was 
lethal. Mortality due to infections secondary to B cell depletion was also observed in two cases.

Major findings 
immediately after dosing) 
Physical examination: increased incidence of gingivitis in males 
Haematology: B cell values in peripheral blood, spleen and lymph nodes 
were undetectable or close to zero throughout the dosing phase, with the 
exception of individual animals that developed anti-obinutuzumab 
antibodies. A transient marginal decrease in natural killer cell numbers was 
noted on Day 3. 
Microscopy: lack of germinal centers in lymph nodes due to B cell depletion, 
immune-complex induced arteritis/periarteritis, and an increased incidence 
and/or severity of mononuclear infiltrates/inflammation in many tissues and 
organs.  
≥25 mg/kg Mortality: 2♂ & 1♀ during recovery phase (all due to chronic 
hypersensitivity reactions i.e. immune-complex glomerulonephritis and/or 
inflammation of other tissues, including serosa/adventitia). 
Clinical signs: 1♀ had an anaphylactoid response post-dose which was 
successfully treated  
Microscopy: immune-complex glomerulonephritis and kidney inflammation. 
IHC staining revealed glomerular, tubular epithelial cell, interstitial and/or 
peritubular capillary granular deposits containing monkey IgG, IgM, and/or 
C3. Electron microscopy showed electron dense deposits in the glomerular 
basement membrane of animals with glomerulonephritis. 
50 mg/kg Mortality: 1♀ prior to necropsy, 1♀ during recovery phase (both 
due to chronic hypersensitivity reactions i.e. immune-complex 
glomerulonephritis and/or inflammation of other tissues, including 
serosa/adventitia). 
Recovery B cell depletion (blood and lymphoid tissues) was completely 
reversed at the end of the recovery phase, except for 1 animal given 5 
mg/kg/dose that exhibited only a partial recovery. Partial recovery of the 
inflammatory changes. 
NOAEL<5mg/kg 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies with obinutuzumab were not performed (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with obinutuzumab (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
No adverse effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed via organ weight 
measurements and histopathological analysis conducted as part of the 26-week repeat-dose toxicity 
study in Cynomolgus monkeys. No treatment-related effect on menstrual cyclicity, sperm count, sperm 
morphology/motility, and reproductive hormone levels were observed.  
No direct maternal toxicity, embryo-foetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed following treatment of 
cynomolgus monkey dams with obinutuzumab at dose levels of 25 or 50 mg/kg/week from Day 20 post 
coitum until birth (table 7). Still, six dams were euthanized during the gestation period due to secondary 
opportunistic infections and hypersensitivity to obinutuzumab. With regard to the offspring, a complete 
depletion of B-lymphocytes was observed at both tested dose-levels. B-lymphocyte counts and 
immunologic function (TDAR) in the infants returned to almost normal levels within 6 months following 
birth.

The mean infant serum levels represented around 76 and 244% of the maternal obinutuzumab serum 
level at post-partum day 28 showing that obinutuzumab crosses the blood-placental barrier. The 
concentration of obinutuzumab in the milk was extremely low compared to the corresponding maternal 
serum concentration. Specifically the milk-to-maternal serum ratios were all less than 0.5% from all 
animals in both dose groups. The maximal dose tested in the enhanced pre- and post-natal development 
study gave rise to a plasma exposure level approximately 2.4-fold higher than obtained clinically at the 
recommended maximal dose of 1000 mg. Chlorambucil is considered a probable genotoxicant and can 
cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women.

Local Tolerance  
Dedicated studies of local tolerance have not been submitted (see discussion on Non-clinical aspects).  
Other toxicity studies 
Obinutuzumab (in concentrations up to 5 mg/mL) was compatible with human whole blood samples and 
plasma samples, as assessed by lack of haemolysis (whole blood) and no plasma flocculation or changes 
in plasma turbidity (Report 1025140; data not shown).  
In vitro studies showed that obinutuzumab has the potential to cause first infusion related cytokine 
release (Reports 1025124, 1045703), following 2 and 24 hours treatment of samples with up to 200 or 
100 μg/ml obinutuzumab, respectively. Following obinutuzumab treatment of human whole blood 
samples for 2 hours, no signs of a potential to cause cytokine release similar to the positive controls were 
observed. However, following 24 hours incubation of the samples (Study 104703), obinutuzumab in 
concentrations 1-10 μg/ml showed similar potential as the positive controls to induce cytokine release. 
The results from the samples treated with obinutuzumab showed a bell-shaped curve, with the maximum 
cytokine release in the interval 1-10 μg/ml, whereas at higher doses of obinutuzumab, lower levels of 
cytokines were seen.  
The tissue cross-reactivity observed in human tissues was similar to the Cynomolgus monkey tissues 
(Reports 1024158, 1024159; data not shown).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Obinutuzumab is a recombinant monoclonal humanised and glycoengineered Type II anti-CD20 antibody 
of the IgG1 isotype. It specifically targeted the extracellular loop of the CD20 transmembrane antigen on 
the surface of non-malignant and malignant pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes, but not on haematopoietic 
stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. Glycoengineering of the Fc part of 
obinutuzumab resulted in higher affinity for FcɣRIII receptors on immune effector cells such as natural 
killer (NK) cells, macrophages and monocytes as compared to non-glycoengineered antibodies (SmPC, 
section 5.1). 
The exact mechanism of action of obinutuzumab remains to be confirmed. At least three different effector 
mechanisms may be involved: 1) cell death (also described as direct cell death or apoptosis), 2) antibody 
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and 3) 
complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).   
ADCC/ADCP is considered as the most important mechanism of action of rituximab in patients, with CDC 
and cell death playing a less important role. In nonclinical studies, obinutuzumab induced direct cell death 
and mediated ADCC and ADCP through recruitment of FcɣRIII positive immune effector cells. In addition, 
in vivo, obinutuzumab mediated only a low degree of CDC. In animal models obinutuzumab mediated 
potent B-cell depletion and antitumour efficacy. Obinutuzumab was characterised by enhanced ADCC as 
a consequence of the glycoengineering (SmPC, section 5.1).  
The contribution of CDC activity of obinutuzumab mechanism of action seemed to be low as the 
neutralization of complement did not impact its efficacy in an in vivo xenograft study and no activation of 
complement was observed in patients. CDC activity does not seem to be a major mechanism of action of 
rituximab either (Alduaij and Illidge 2011; Beers et al. 2010; Glennie et al. 2007; Lim et al. 2010) 
The mechanism of direct cell death induction has not been clearly elucidated. Cell death induction by 
obinutuzumab coincided with homotypic aggregation but was not dependent on mechanical disruption 
(Cragg et al. 2010, Herter et al. 2013a). Obinutuzumab could induce an immunogenic cell death that may 
lead to a secondary immune response against lymphoma/leukemia cells in vivo and in patients (Cheadle 
et al., 2013). Ex vivo studies with CLL patient samples showed that cell death induction in peripheral 
slowly-proliferating CLL cells was lower than for example in proliferating DLBCL cell lines (data not 
shown).   
During the review, the applicant submitted two new studies investigating the contribution of direct cell 
death induction to obinutuzumab mechanism of action and using a variant of obinutuzumab with strongly 
reduced FcgR and effector function (obinutuzumab N297D; data not shown). The variant of 
obinutuzumab lacked FcgR binding by removal of the N-glycosylation site by introduction of a N297D 
mutation resulting in complete absence of the carbohydrate moiety of the antibody. As a consequence 
FcgR binding and C1q binding was strongly reduced rendering the mutated antibody effector dead. In 
vitro, the variant of obinutuzumab showed comparable direct cell death induction as compared to 
obinutuzumab and non-glycoengineered (GE) obinutuzumab; a residual ADCC activity; no CDC activity. 
In a B cell depletion assay, obinutuzumab N297D induced an inferior cell depletion compared to 
obinutuzumab and to non-GE obinutuzumab to a lesser extent but a greater cell depletion than rituximab 
or ofatumumab. In an in vivo study in sc SU-DHL4 xenograft model, obinutuzumab N297D induced tumor 
stasis but not complete tumor remission as seen with obinutuzumab and non-GE obinutuzumab. These 
data indicated that direct cell death induction significantly contributed to obinutuzumab mechanism of 
action but that both cell death induction and ADCC were necessary to achieve maximal efficacy.

The validations of the bioanalysis methods used for quantification of obinutuzumab in Cynomolgus 
monkey serum were not performed according to GLP. However, the analytical method was validated 
according to the guidance valid at the time of study performance, which was consistent with the FDA 
Guidance on Bioanalytical Method Validation and best industry practices (Kelley M et al. 2007, 
Viswanathan CT et al. 2007) with regards to the tested validation parameters and pre-defined acceptance 
criteria; thus, the lack of GLP compliance of the bioanalysis validation was considered acceptable. 
The in vivo distribution of obinutuzumab has not been studied. This is deemed acceptable due to 1) the 
fact that obinutuzumab is specific for CD20 whose tissue expression is characterized 2) the fact that 
pharmacokinetic data indicate limited distribution beyond the plasma compartment and 3) the human 
cross-reactivity study indicates no potential for off-target binding. In accordance with the ICH S6 
guideline, it is also acceptable that the metabolism and excretion of obinutuzumab has not been studied. 
No dedicated nonclinical drug interaction study has been performed with obinutuzumab. Due to its nature 
as an antibody, obinutuzumab is not expected to have direct effect on the activity or expression of 
cytochrome P450 enzymes or drug transporters.  
Information on potential acute effects of obinutuzumab was obtained from the repeat-dose safety studies 
in Cynomolgus monkeys, which included detailed assessments of clinical pathology, cytokine release, 
immunophenotyping, and/or cardiovascular safety after the first dose. Results showed no overt toxicity 
after the first dose. According to ICH guidance M3(R2), the results of these studies are considered 
appropriate to address acute toxicity aspects. Therefore, the lack of dedicated single-dose toxicity studies 
was considered acceptable. 
In a 26 week cynomolgus monkey study, hypersensitivity reactions were noted and attributed to the 
foreign recognition of the humanised antibody in cynomolgus monkeys (0.7-6 times the clinical exposure 
based on Cmax and AUC at steady state after weekly administration of 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg). Findings 
included acute anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions and an increased prevalence of systemic 
inflammation and infiltrates consistent with immune complex mediated hypersensitivity reactions, such 
as arteritis/periarteritis, glomerulonephritis, and serosal/adventitial inflammation. These reactions led to 
unscheduled termination of 6/36 animals treated with obinutuzumab during dosing and recovery phases; 
these changes were partially reversible. No renal toxicity with a causal relationship to obinutuzumab has 
been observed in humans. 
The lack of genotoxicity studies with obinutuzumab is acceptable because antibodies do not have the 
potential to cross the cell membrane.  
No studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of obinutuzumab (SmPC, section 
5.3). The lack of carcinogenicity studies is considered acceptable based ICH S6 guidance. It should be 
noted that the present application concerns obinutuzumab co-treatment with chlorambucil, which is a 
human carcinogen.  
An enhanced pre and postnatal development (ePPND) toxicity study in pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys 
showed no evidence of teratogenic effects. However, weekly obinutuzumab dosing from post-coitum day 
20 to delivery resulted in complete depletion of B cells in infants at weekly intravenous obinutuzumab 
doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg (2-5 times the clinical exposure based on Cmax and AUC). Offspring exposure 
on day 28 post-partum suggested that obinutuzumab can cross the blood-placenta -barrier. 
Concentrations in infant serum on day 28 post-partum, were in the range of concentrations in maternal 
serum, whereas concentrations in milk on the same day were very low (less than 0.5% of the 
corresponding maternal serum levels) suggesting that exposure of infants must have occurred in utero. 
The B- cell counts returned to normal levels, and immunologic function was restored within 6 months 
post-partum  (SmPC, section 5.3 and 4.6).

There are no data from the use of obinutuzumab in pregnant women. Obinutuzumab should not be 
administered to pregnant women unless the possible benefit outweighs the potential risk (SmPC, section 
4.6). 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for 18 months after 
treatment with obinutuzumab (SmPC, section 4.6). 
In case of exposure during pregnancy, depletion of B cells may be expected in newborns due to the 
pharmacological properties of the product. Consequently, newborns should be monitored for B cell 
depletion and vaccinations with live virus vaccines should be postponed until the infant’s B cell count has 
recovered (SmPC, sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Animal studies have shown excretion of obinutuzumab in breast milk (SmPC, section 4.6). Because 
human immunoglobulin G (IgG) is excreted in human milk and the potential for absorption and harm to 
the infant is unknown, women should be advised to discontinue breast-feeding during obinutuzumab 
therapy and for 18 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab (SmPC, section 4.6). 
Due to the potential depletion of B cells in newborns following exposure to obinutuzumab during 
pregnancy, virus vaccines should be postponed until the infant’s B cell count has recovered (SmPC, 
section 4.4, see discussion on clinical safety). 
No specific studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of obinutuzumab on fertility. In 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys obinutuzumab had no adverse effects on male and 
female reproductive organs (SmPC, section 5.3). The same conclusion has been reached for other CD20 
antibodies, i.e., rituximab and ofatumumab. However, in the clinical setting obinutuzumab will be 
co-administered with chlorambucil which has induced reversible and permanent sterility in men and 
women. 
Obinutuzumab is not indicated for treatment of the paediatric population and Obinutuzumab has been 
granted a waiver for paediatric development. The lack of studies in juvenile animals is considered 
acceptable. 
Since the clinically intended route of administration (IV) was also applied in the pivotal toxicity studies, 
the lack of dedicated studies of local tolerance is considered acceptable. 
Renal changes have been observed with obinutuzumab in intravenous toxicity studies in Cynomolgus 
monkeys. Based on light microscopic evaluations, the main kidney findings were glomerulonephritis, 
interstitial inflammation and tubular degeneration/regeneration. Glomerulonephritis was considered to 
be immune-complex mediated, as confirmed by immunofluorescence detection of IgG deposits and the 
observation of sub-epithelial and intra-membranous electron dense regions in the glomeruli by electron 
microscopy. These findings are considered specific to non-human primates. No evidence for an 
association between obinutuzumab treatment and renal toxicity was identified. A few patients showed 
>grade 2 shift in creatinine, however, this appeared to be transient as mean creatinine values remained 
stable during treatment. 
Antibodies, as other peptides and proteins, are exempted from environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
based on the EMA 2006 Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for Non-GMO Human 
Medicinal Products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical documentation submitted was considered adequate. The relevant information 
has been included in the SmPC (sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.1, 5.3).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Plasma samples were collected for PK investigation purposes in five clinical studies. In three studies 
(Phase I/II BO20999, Phase I/II BO21003, and Phase I JO21900 studies), obinutuzumab was 
administered as a single agent. In two others studies (Phase Ib BO21000 and Phase III pivotal 
BO21004/CLL11 studies) obinutuzumab was administered in combination with chemotherapy in 
CD20-positive malignant disease patients.  
A population pharmacokinetic model was developed to analyse the PK data in 678 NHL and CLL patients 
from Phase I, Phase II and Phase III studies who received obinutuzumab. This population PK model was 
used to describe the PK characteristics of obinutuzumab in patients with CLL. 
Absorption  
Obinutuzumab is administered intravenously, therefore absorption is not applicable. There have been no 
clinical PK studies performed with other routes of administration. From the population PK model, after the 
Cycle 6 Day 1 infusion in CLL patients, the estimated median Cmax value was 473.2 μg/mL and AUC(τ) 
value was 9516 μg•d/mL (SmPC section 5.2). 
Tables 10-11 present the PK exposure data for obinutuzumab following first dose and at the end of 
treatment for studies BO20999 and BO21000 and the end of induction for study BO21003.

BO21003 at the End of Treatment/Induction 
Distribution 
There are no data on protein binding of obinutuzumab. Following intravenous administration, the volume 
of distribution of the central compartment (2.76 L), approximated serum volume, which indicates that 
distribution, is largely restricted to plasma and interstitial fluid (SmPC section 5.2). 
Elimination 
The metabolism of obinutuzumab has not been directly studied. Antibodies are mostly cleared by 
catabolism (SmPC section 5.2).  
Obinutuzumab elimination comprised a time varying clearance model with two parallel pathways which 
described clearance, a linear clearance pathway and a non-linear clearance pathway which changed as a 
function of time. During the initiation of treatment, the non-linear time-varying clearance pathway was 
dominant and accounted for the major clearance pathway. As treatment progressed, the impact of this 
pathway diminished and the linear clearance pathway predominated. This was indicative of target 
mediated drug disposition (TMDD), where the initial abundance of CD20 cells caused a rapid depletion of 
obinutuzumab. However, once the majority of CD20 cells were bound to obinutuzumab, there was 
reduced impact of TMDD on PK (SmPC section 5.2). 
For a female patient with CLL weighing 75 kg and with baseline tumor size less than 1750 mm2, the time 
varying clearance (CLT = 0.231 L/day) was estimated to be 2.8-times higher than steady-state clearance 
(CLinf = 0.0828 L/day).  Time-dependent clearance declined with a half-life of 17 days, and 
concentrations approached steady-state levels after approximately 4 months of dosing (for Study 
BO21004/CLL). Median elimination t½ was 30.3 days.  
Obinutuzumab steady-state clearance and central volume increased with body weight as power functions 
with the power coefficients of 0.602 (95% CI: 0.404−0.800) and 0.403 (95% CI: 0.307−0.499), 
respectively. Obinutuzumab steady-state clearance and central volume were respectively 23% (95% CI: 
14−32%) and 18% (95% CI: 13−22%) higher in males (see special populations). Initial time-dependent 
clearance was 52% (95% CI: 23−87%) higher in males.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 42/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Decline of time-dependent clearance was 87% (95% CI: 44−125%) faster in NHL compared to CLL 
patients, and 148% (95% CI: 93−219%) faster in patients with low baseline tumor size (below 1750 
mm2). At the same dose, patients with high baseline tumor size generally had lower exposure. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies

BO20999, BO21000 and BO21003. 
Special populations  
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender was found to be a covariate which explained some of 
the inter-patient variability, with a 22% greater steady state clearance (CLss) and an 18% greater 
volume of distribution (V) in males. However, results from the population analysis have shown that the 
differences in exposure were not significant (with an estimated median AUC and Cmax of 11282 µg•d/ml 
and 578.9 µg/ml in females and 8451 µg•d/mL and 432.5 µg/mL in males, respectively at Cycle 6), 
indicating that there is no need to dose adjust based on gender (SmPC section 5.2). 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis of obinutuzumab showed that age did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab. No significant difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of 
obinutuzumab among patients < 65 years (n=265), patients between 65-75 years (n=197) and patients 
> 75 years (n=128) (SmPC section 5.2). No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 
4.2). 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab in paediatric 
patients (SmPC section 5.2). The safety and efficacy of Gazyvaro in children and adolescents aged below 
18 years has not been established. No data are available (SmPC, section 4.2). 
No difference in AUC exposure between Caucasians and Japanese subjects was apparent.

The population pharmacokinetic analysis of obinutuzumab showed that creatinine clearance did not affect 
pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab. Pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab in patients with mild creatinine 
clearance (CrCl 50-89 mL/min, n=306) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 49 mL/min, n=72) renal impairment 
were similar to those in patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥90 mL/min, n=207). Pharmacokinetic 
data in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-29 mL/min) is limited (n=5), therefore no dose 
recommendations can be made  (SmPC section 5.2; see Risk Management Plan). 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
[CrCl] 30-89 mL/min) (see SmPC section 5.2). The safety and efficacy of Gazyvaro has not been 
established in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). 
No formal pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment  (SmPC section 
5.2; see Risk Management Plan). The safety and efficacy of Gazyvaro in patients with impaired hepatic 
function has not been established. No specific dose recommendations can be made (SmPC, section 4.2). 
Nine patients in the PK database had obinutuzumab human anti-human antibody (HAHA) detected after 
treatment initiation, all from the pivotal phase III study BO21004/CLL11 during the follow-up period. The 
PK of these patients was similar to the PK of the other patients during treatment. The most recent analysis 
of immunogenicity data for study BO21004/CLL11 was performed at the data cut-off for the Stage 2 
analysis; the incidence of HAHA-positive patients was 2% at 6 months follow-up, 3% at 9 months 
follow-up, and 6% at 12 months follow-up. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies/ Pharmacokinetics using human 
biomaterials 
No in vitro or in vivo studies on pharmacokinetic drug interactions have been submitted. 
No differences in obinutuzumab PK behaviour were observed between study BO21004/CLL in which 
obinutuzumab was administered in combination with chlorambucil and those studies in which 
chlorambucil was not used.   
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies were submitted. In the pivotal clinical study BO21004/CLL11, 91% 
(40 out of 44) of evaluable patients treated with obinutuzumab were B- cell depleted (defined as CD19+ 
B -cell counts < 0.07 x 109/L) at the end of treatment period and remained depleted during the first 6 
months of follow up. Recovery of B- cells was observed within 12-18 months of follow up in 35% (14  out 
of 40) of patients without progressive disease and 13% (5 out of 40) with progressive disease (SmPC, 
section 5.1).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
PD data supportive to the suggested mechanism of action have been submitted (data not shown). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the PK profile is best described by a two-compartment model with two different clearance 
mechanisms: one time dependent (suggesting a target-mediated mechanism) and one linear. The 
time-varying target mediated component inherently suggests lack of dose-proportionality.

Data from phase I/II studies are from different study populations with in fact most data from patients 
suffering from follicular/indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Based on simulations (data not shown) 
predicted clearance was about 19% lower in patients with BCL/DLBCL compared to patients with CLL, and 
AUC (tau) was 27% (BCL) and 39% (DLBCL) higher than in patients with CLL. These differences are 
unlikely to be of clinical relevance.  
A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed to analyse the PK data in 678 non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL) and CLL patients from Phase I, Phase II and Phase III studies who received 
obinutuzumab. This population PK model was used to describe the PK characteristics of obinutuzumab in 
patients with CLL (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Estimates of PK parameters from the population PK model were a central volume of distribution of around 
2.76 L; initial clearance values (for a female patient with CLL weighing 75 kg and with baseline tumor size 
less than 1750 mm2) of around 0.23 L/day and steady-state clearance 0.083 L/day. The relevance of the 
population PK models with respect to differences in the target expression among the different diseases 
was investigated.  
In accordance with current guideline on therapeutic proteins, no studies on metabolism have been 
submitted. 
From population PK model with a target-specific clearance component, a lack of dose-proportionality and 
time-dependency is expected to some extent. This model suggested moderate effects of gender, low- and 
high weight on PK parameters with an order of magnitude of about 30%. This is unlikely to be of clinical 
relevance. No effects of impaired renal function, age or race were apparent.  
Interindividual variability appeared to be high with CV% around 100.  No covariable was identified as a 
key element explaining the large inter-individual variability of obinutuzumab PK, and so no 
recommendations can be drawn for the dosage adjustment by the PK population modelling. The need for 
individualization of dose or drug monitoring has been considered. Whilst clinical efficacy has been 
observed at 1000 mg in the pivotal study BO21004/CLL11, there was no evidence from the phase I/II 
studies that a lower dose would have been equally effective. An exploratory graphical analysis in the 
Population PK Report did not indicate that there was any relationship between obinutuzumab exposure 
and adverse events such as infusion-related reactions and neutropenia. Thus, dose individualization and 
drug monitoring are not necessary. 
No formal drug - drug interaction (DDI) studies were undertaken with obinutuzumab. Specific drug 
interaction studies are generally not required for this type of drug. Due to the fact that it is an antibody, 
obinutuzumab is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP450), uridine diphosphate 
glucuronyltransferase (UGT) enzymes and transporters such as P-glycoprotein. Therefore, no 
pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with drugs known to be metabolised by these enzyme systems 
(SmPC, section 4.5). 
The effect of a co-treatement with chlorambucil on the PK of obinutuzumab has been investigated in the 
population PK model. Chlorambucil seemed to have no clinically relevant effect on the PK of 
obinutuzumab (data not shown). 
Cytokine modulation as an indirect mechanism appears unlikely given the transient nature of these 
changes (data not shown). Data from clinical trials do not suggest that concomitant chemotherapy has 
clinically relevant effect on obinutuzumab pharmacokinetics (data not shown). Data from ongoing trials 
are elucidating the possible effect of obinutuzumab on the PK of concomitant chemotherapeutic 
treatment, including CHOP (study GAO4915g) and bendamustine (study GAO4753g). The applicant will 
submit these data when available (see Risk Management Plan). Potential interaction between 
obinutuzumab and chlorambucil linked to metabolization / excretion pathways is unlikely.

Anti-CD20 antibodies are not considered to be cardiotoxic, and there is no plausible mechanism of direct 
cardiotoxicity for these drugs as cardiac cells do not express the CD20 antigen. Obinutuzumab is not 
expected to induce QT prolongation. The co administration of obinutuzumab with drugs known to prolong 
QTc and inducing Torsades de Pointes was discussed. As obinutuzumab is a monoclonal antibody, it would 
not be capable of interacting directly with ion channels, including the hERG channel. See also discussion 
on clinical safety (worsening of pre-existing cardiac conditions). 
Likewise, obinutuzumab induced serious neutropenia and knowing the safety profile of chlorambucil 
towards blood cells, the mention of a risk of hematologic adverse effects potentiation was included in the 
product information (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended during treatment and until B cell recovery 
because of the immunosuppressive effect of obinutuzumab (SmPC, sections 4.4 and 4.5, see discussion 
on non-clinical safety). 
The suggested mechanism of action appears biologically plausible based on in vitro- and animal studies. 
No additional clinical pharmacodynamic studies are considered necessary. 
Immunogenicity of obinutuzumab did not appear to present a clinically relevant issue from the data 
available. However the amount of data available on this subject is limited and does not allow for definite 
conclusions. From a visual inspection of data of exposure (Cmean) against efficacy outcomes, it is not 
possible to draw clinically meaningful conclusions on an association between exposure and outcome. 
Immunogenicity has been categorized as a potential risk (see discussion on clinical safety and Risk 
Management Plan). 
During development, three different manufacturing processes were established for obinutuzumab: the 
first generation (G1/DP1), the second generation (G2/DP2), and the third generation (G3/DP3) process. 
The applicant has demonstrated comparability between the different drug product DS/DP generations in 
vitro and in the population-PK analysis (data not shown). 
Limited data are available on the effect of Fc gamma receptor polymorphisms on the efficacy of 
obinutuzumab (Risk Management Plan). In Study BO21004, subgroup analysis confirmed no difference in 
PFS, the primary endpoint of the study, between patients with the low affinity and high affinity variants 
FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa. For rituximab, no clear dependency of response or outcome according to the 
FcγRIIIA/IIA polymorphism has been established in CLL, follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of obinutuzumab has been reasonably well investigated and generally in accordance with the 
current guideline on therapeutic proteins. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Thirteen (13) patients received obinutuzumab at doses of 400 mg up to and including 2000 mg (given as 
a flat dose) in study BO20999. There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and no requirement for dose 
reductions. Five patients experienced CTC Grade 4 neutropenia as the maximum severity and four 
patients experienced NCICTC Grade 3 neutropenia as the maximum severity. The overall response rate 
with obinutuzumab monotherapy as assessed by the International Workshop on CLL criteria observed was 
in the region of 60-70%. There was no clear dose-response relationship.

The Phase I study together with modelling and simulation indicated that the same levels of obinutuzumab 
exposure and saturation of target could be achieved with a more practical schedule of 1000 mg used 
throughout a treatment course and an additional dose given at Day 15 of the first cycle for the CLL 
patients. In the phase II trial BO20999 a dose of 1000 mg of GA101 to be administered on Days 1, 8 and 
15 of the first cycle and then on Day 1 of Cycles 2 - 8 for a maximum of eight cycles (10 infusions in total). 
Based on the combined Phase I and II results, modelling and simulation, the Phase III dose of 1000 mg 
has been selected to take forward in both CLL and NHL. All patients randomized to the GClb treatment 
arm were to receive 1000 mg of obinutuzumab as an IV infusion on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of the first 
treatment cycle (Cycle 1). For each subsequent cycle, patients received obinutuzumab (1000 mg) as an 
IV infusion on Day 1 only (Cycle 2−6).

Treatments 
Prior to randomization, 6 eligible patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria entered an 
open−label, safety run−in phase with GClb. After review of the safety data from these 6 patients by the 
DSMB, the randomized phase was opened. 
Obinutuzumab 
Prior to treatment, all patients received pre-medication. All 6 patients entering the safety run-in and all 
patients randomized to the GClb treatment arm received 1000 mg of obinutuzumab as an IV infusion on 
Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of the first treatment cycle (Cycle 1, see also discussion on clinical safety on 
amendments introducing the splitting of the Day 1 dose). For each subsequent cycle, patients received 
obinutuzumab (1000 mg) as an IV infusion on Day 1 only (Cycle 2−6). 
Obinutuzumab was administered with full emergency resuscitation facilities immediately available and 
patients were closely supervised by the investigator at all times. 
Originally, for patients with a high white blood cell (WBC) count, the infusion could be given extremely 
slowly over a longer period of time, or the dose could be split (2 × 500 mg) and given over two 
consecutive days.

Rituximab 
Prior to treatment, all patients received pre-medication. Rituximab was administered according to 
standard institutional practice. 
All patients randomized to the RClb arm received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as an IV infusion on Day 1 of 
the first treatment cycle (Cycle 1). 
For each subsequent cycle, patients received rituximab (500 mg/m2) as an IV infusion on Day 1 (Cycles 
2−6). Thus, the licensed dose of rituximab for use in B-CLL was used. 
Rituximab was administered with full emergency resuscitation facilities immediately available and 
patients were closely supervised by the investigator at all times. 
Chlorambucil 
The rationale for the Clb dosing is primarily based on the findings from the German GCLLSG CLL5 trial. All 
patients received 0.5 mg/kg body weight of Clb given orally on Day 1 and Day 15 of all treatment cycles 
(Cycles 1−6). The interval between each cycle was 28 days. In patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) 
>35 (Grade 2 obesity) the dose of Clb was capped at a maximum limit associated with a BMI of 35. 
Anti-pyretic and Anti-histaminic Prophylaxis 
Because some patients may develop hypersensitivity or other IRRs to obinutuzumab or rituximab, 
premedication with oral acetaminophen/paracetamol (650 mg to 1000 mg) and an anti−histamine such 
as diphenhydramine (50 mg to 100 mg) was administered to all patients approximately 30 minutes prior 
to the start of the first infusion (unless contraindicated). For subsequent obinutuzumab infusions, 
pre−medication with oral acetaminophen/paracetamol was administered. If the previously administered 
obinutuzumab infusion did not result in an IRR greater than an NCI CTCAE Grade 1 adverse event (i.e., no 
medication was required to treat the IRR and there was no interruption to the infusion), the 
anti−histamine pre−medication could be omitted. Pre−medication with an antipyretic and an 
antihistaminic was administered before each infusion of rituximab. 
Corticosteroid Premedication 
Initially, the protocol outlined that pre−medication with corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg IV prednisolone or 
equivalent) could be given to obinutuzumab−treated patients who were considered at high risk for a 
severe IRR (e.g., high circulating lymphocyte count). 
Pre−medication with corticosteroids (e.g. 100 mg IV prednisolone or equivalent) was also recommended 
for rituximab patients whose lymphocyte counts are > 25 × 109/L. The option of pre−medication with 
corticosteroids was later amended making it mandatory that all obinutuzumab- and rituximab−treated 
patients received corticosteroids at least 1 hour prior to the first infusion and that an equivalent dose of 
dexamethasone (20 mg) or methylprednisolone (80 mg) was permitted but hydrocortisone was not used. 
For subsequent infusions with obinutuzumab and rituximab, corticosteroid premedication was given to 
patients who experienced a Grade 3 IRR with the previous infusion, patients with lymphocyte counts >25 
× 109/L, and at the investigator’s discretion. 
Concomitant Anti-hypertensive Medications 
Originally in the protocol under the warning and precautions section for both ritixumab and obinutuzumab 
the recommendation was given that since hypotension could occur as a result of an IRR, consideration 
was to be given to withholding anti−hypertensive medications for 12 hours prior to the infusion. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 49/123 
 
 
 
 
 
In protocol amendment G, this guidance was moved to the concomitant medications section to emphasize 
the importance and the wording for obinutuzumab was slightly amended: Anti−hypertensive drugs used 
to control underlying hypertension were not given on the morning of, and throughout the first infusion of, 
obinutuzumab. Of note, anti−hypertensive treatment could still be used to treat IRR−triggered 
hypertension, if required. 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Patients with a high tumor burden (WBC >25 × 109/L or bulky lymphadenopathy) received prophylaxis 
for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) prior to the initiation of treatment. These patients were to be well 
hydrated. It was requested that a fluid intake of approximately 3 liters per day was maintained, 1−2 days 
before the first dose of obinutuzumab or rituximab. All patients with high tumor burden were treated with 
allopurinol, or a suitable alternative treatment, starting 12−24 hours prior to the first infusion. Patients 
continued to receive repeated prophylaxis with allopurinol and adequate hydration prior to each 
subsequent infusion, if deemed appropriate by the investigator. 
Infection Prophylaxis 
In patients with neutropenia, or at risk of neutropenia, it was strongly recommended to give antibiotic 
prophylaxis (e.g., co−trimoxazole) throughout the treatment period.  
Choice of antibiotic, dose and schedule was according to standard institutional practice. 
Antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis was given at the discretion of the investigator.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of study BO21004 (also known as study CLL11) was to demonstrate clinically 
relevant statistical superiority in PFS with obinutuzumab + Clb (GClb) compared to rituximab + Clb (RClb) 
and Clb alone and RClb compared to Clb (GClb vs. Clb; GClb vs. RClb; RClb vs. Clb) in previously 
untreated CLL patients with comorbidities. The Clinical Study Report (CSR) initially submitted reports the 
primary analysis of GClb versus Clb (Stage 1a). Subsequently the applicant also submitted the CSR for 
the primary analysis of GClb versus RClb (Stage 2). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was PFS. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of 
progression, relapse, or death from any cause as assessed by the investigator. Data for patients without 
disease progression or death will be censored at the time of the last response assessment, or, if no 
response assessments were performed after the baseline visit, at the time of randomization plus one day. 
PFS based on IRC assessments was also analyzed to support the primary analysis. Disease progression 
was to be assessed by the investigators assessed according to the IWCLL guidelines. 
Secondary endpoints 
Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time between date of randomization and the date of disease 
progression/relapse,  death,  or  start  of  a  new  anti-leukemic  therapy.  If  the  specified  event  (disease 
progression/relapse, death, start of a new anti-leukemic treatment) did not occur, patients were censored 
at the date of last tumor assessment. In cases where no tumor assessment is available, patients were 
conservatively censored at the date of randomization plus one day. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 50/123 
 
 
 
 
 
Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined for all patients with complete response at any time from 56 days 
after end of treatment onwards. DFS extends from the date the complete response was first recorded to 
the date on which progressive disease (PD) is first noted or the date of death due to any cause. 
Only assessments from 56 days after end of treatment onwards were taken into account. Patients with no 
documented progression after CR/CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi) were censored at the 
last date at which they are known to have been in CR/CRi. 
Duration of response (DOR) was defined similarly for complete and partial responders at any time from 56 
days after end of treatment onwards. DOR starts at the date the response (either CR or PR) was first 
recorded until the date on which PD is first noted or the date of death due to any cause. 
Only assessments from 56 days after end of treatment onwards were taken into account. Patients with no 
documented progression after CR/CRi or PR were censored at the last date at which they are known to 
have had the CR/CRi or PR. 
Time to re-treatment/new anti-leukemic therapy was defined as time between the date of randomization 
and the date of first intake of re-treatment or new anti-leukemic therapy. Patients who were reported as 
not having started re-treatment or new anti−leukemic therapy were censored at the last visit date they 
were assessed with regard to start of new treatment or the date of death. 
Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death 
due to any cause. Patients who were not reported as having died at the time of the analysis were censored 
at the date when they were last known to be alive. 
End  of  treatment  response  was  defined  as  the  response  occurring  at  the  end  of  treatment  (first 
assessment  that  occurred  more  than  56  days  after  the  end  of  treatment)  before  start  of  new 
anti−leukemia treatment. If the only response assessment after treatment end is PD, it was included 
irrespective of when it occurred (i.e., even if earlier than 56 days after the end of treatment). Overall 
response rate for end of treatment response (end of treatment response rate) is defined as percentage of 
patients  with  CR,  incomplete  CR  (CRi),  nodular  partial  response  (nPR),  or  PR  at  end  of  treatment 
response. Patients with no post-baseline response assessment (due to whatever reason) and patients 
with post-baseline response assessments (excluding PD) but with no end of treatment response available 
as well as patients with stable disease (SD) or PD as of the end of treatment response were considered 
non-responders for end of treatment response. 
However,  if  at  any  time  the  only  response  assessment  reported  for  a  patient  is  PD,  it  was  included 
irrespective of the time point it occurred. 
Best overall response was defined as the best response recorded from 56 days after end of treatment 
onwards before start of  new anti-leukemic treatment. Overall response rate for best overall response 
(best overall response rate) is defined as percentage of patients with CR, CRi, PR, or nPR as best overall 
response. Patients with no post-baseline response assessment (due to whatever reason) were 
considered non-responders for best overall response as well as patients with SD or PD. 
Best overall response within 1 year of start of study treatment was defined as the best response recorded 
from 56 days after end of treatment onwards until disease progression, death, or 6 months (190 days) 
after last administration of last component of study drug, whichever occurs first. Overall response rate for 
best overall response (best overall response rate within 1 year of start of study treatment) is defined as 
percentage of patients with CR, CRi, PR, or nPR as best overall response. Patients with no post-baseline 
response assessment (due to whatever reason) and patients with post-baseline response assessments 
but no response assessments up to 6 months after last administration of last component of study drug 
were considered non-responders for best overall response as well as patients with SD or PD. 
Molecular remission was defined as an MRD-negative result at the end of treatment (assessment that 
occurred between 56 days and 6 months of last treatment).

Sample size 
The primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS was used to determine the sample size for the study. 
The median PFS for Clb in this patient population was estimated to be 14 months. At the time the protocol 
was written, there were no published Phase III data for patients treated with RClb. 
However, according to expert opinions, patients treated with RClb would be expected to progress at least 
8 to 10 months later than patients treated with Clb alone. Therefore, a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.6 for a RClb 
versus Clb comparison seemed reasonable. For the comparison of GClb versus RClb, an HR of 0.74 is 
assumed as a possible treatment effect. Both of these estimated HRs result in an assumed HR of 0.44 for 
GClb versus Clb alone. 
This led to the following assumptions on the treatment effects: 
• Median PFS for Clb alone = 12 months 
• Effect of RClb versus Clb alone: HR = 0.6 (corresponding to a median PFS for RClb of 20 months) 
• Effect of GClb versus RClb: HR = 0.74 (corresponding to a median PFS for GClb of 27 months) 
Statistical assumptions for the comparison of GClb versus RClb: 
• α= 5% (two-sided test level, for the entire closed-test procedure) 
• Power = 80% 
• Dropout rate = 10% per year 
Thus, 780 patients in total have to be recruited within approximately 36 months assuming non-linear 
recruitment with the following study start ramp up: 
• Months 1−3: 4 patients each 
• Month 4: 8 patients 
• Month 5: 12 patients 
• Month 6: 16 patients 
• Month 7: 20 patients 
• After Month 7: 24.5 patients until recruitment end 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the three 
treatment  arms  via  a  block  stratified  randomization  procedure  using  an  interactive  voice/web-based 
system  (IVRS).  Patients  were  stratified  by  Binet  stage  and  country/region.  The  country/regions  were 
classified as: 
•  Asia and Oceania: Hong Kong, China, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand;

Statistical methods 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the following three hypotheses: 
• 
• 
• 
PFS of GClb versus Clb alone: H0: GClb = Clb versus H1: GClb ≠ Clb (Stage 1a) 
PFS of RClb versus Clb alone: H0: RClb = Clb versus H1: RClb ≠ Clb (Stage 1b) 
PFS of GClb versus RClb: H0: GClb = RClb versus H1: GClb ≠ RClb (Stage 2)

Adjustments for multiplicity were to be done using a three arm closed test procedure. The first test was 
for any difference between the three treatment groups at an alpha level of 5%. If the null hypothesis of 
equal PFS distributions for all 3 groups was rejected, pairwise tests for each of the three above mentioned 
hypotheses were enabled at the 5% alpha level. 
Details on sample size and timing of the analysis are provided in Table 14.

Analysis Populations 
Four different patient populations were defined. 
CHMP assessment report

Stage 1: Patients randomized in parallel to all three treatment groups (approximately 590 patients). This 
set of patients was used for the global test of any difference between any of the three treatment groups. 
For all comparisons of GClb or RClb against Clb, only Stage 1 patients are used. 
Stage 1 + 2: Patients randomized at any time during the trial (approximately 780 patients). The patients 
randomized to GClb and RClb arms (approximately 662 patients) will be used for the Stage 2 analyses of 
comparison of GClb versus RClb and reported at a later date. 
Data for the 6 safety run-in patients administered GClb and the data collected for the 22 patients who 
crossed over from Clb to GClb by the clinical cutoff were analyzed and reported. 
The primary analysis population for efficacy was the ITT population, defined as all randomized patients. 
Patients were assigned to treatment groups as randomized.  
In addition, a per protocol (PP) population was defined for a sensitivity analysis of PFS. The PP population 
comprised all patients who completed study therapy (defined as having received at least three cycles of 
study  therapy)  and  patients  who  terminated  treatment  before  three  cycles  because  of  disease 
progression  or  death.  Patients  in  this  analysis  population  fulfilled  all  the  inclusion  criteria  and  had  no 
major protocol violations. Patients were assigned to treatment groups as treated. The purpose of the PP 
population was to assess the robustness of the primary analysis (based on the ITT population) and to 
quantify  more  precisely  the  magnitude  of  the  potential  clinical  benefit  of  the  treatment  in  the  target 
population.

Conduct of the study 
The initial protocol, dated 21 July 2009, has been amended 7 times.  This included: 
• 
• 
• 
The dose of chlorambucil was capped at a maximum dose associated with a body mass index of 
35, antibiotic prophylaxis was strongly recommended (Amendment 3);  
Premedication requirements were modified to include corticosteroids (100 mg prednisolone or 20 
mg dexamethasone or 80 mg methylprednisolone) for all patients during the first infusion in an 
effort to reduce the risk of IRRs (Amendment 5). 
To further reduce the risk and severity of IRRs and on the recommendation of the DSMB, the first 
infusion of obinutuzumab was to be given over two days (100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 
2) with a reduced rate of infusion during the first day (Amendment 6; see discussion on clinical 
safety). 
Baseline data 
Overall, the majority of patients in the Stage 1a analysis were male (60%), less than 75 years of age 
(58%) but 65 years or above (81%); the median age of patients was 73.0 years (range: 39 to 88 years, 
Table 15). Baseline disease information is summarized in tables 16-17. The distribution of prognostic 
factors at baseline was balanced between the treatment arms; 61% of patients had unmutated IgVh gene 
(Clb arm: 59% patients vs. GClb arm: 61% patients) and 46% patients were ZAP-70 positive (Clb arm: 
49% patients vs. GClb arm: 44% patients) (Table 18).  
The treatment groups were balanced with respect to cytogenic abnormalities at baseline, although 82% 
of patients in the Clb arm and 74% of patients in the GClb arm who were tested did not have normal 
karyotype at baseline. The treatment groups were balanced with respect to the hierarchical model of 
polymorphisms, apart from the lower percentage of patients with a normal karyotype in the Clb arm 
(15%) compared to the GClb arm (23%). 
Fcγ receptor polymorphism results were available for 330 of 356 patients (93%).The treatment arms 
were balanced with respect to FcγRIIa and FCγRIIIa polymorphisms with the majority of patients having 
the 131 HR variant of FCγRIIa (47%) and the 158 FV or FF variant of FCγRIIIa (47% and 42%, 
respectively). Eight percent of patients in the Clb group and 7% of patients in the GClb group had the 
158VV mutation. 
The criteria for initiating treatment based on IWCLL criteria were fulfilled by 100% of patients included in 
the ITT population. According to these criteria a patient who was categorized as Binet C Stage required 
therapy, while those with Binet Stage A or B required evidence of active or progressive disease. 
The treatment groups were balanced with respect to the percentage of patients with Binet Stage C at 
baseline (Clb arm: 37% patients vs. GClb arm: 36% patients). The treatment arms were also balanced 
with respect to the reasons why the remaining 74 patients in the Clb group and 153 patients in the GClb 
group who were not Binet Stage C at baseline, initiated treatment and included severe B symptoms (Clb 
arm: 47% patients vs. GClb arm: 46% patients), massive symptoms of lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly 
(45% in each treatment arm), lymphocyte doubling time < 6 months (Clb arm: 43% patients, GClb arm: 
38% patients). Additionally, 12% patients in the Clb arm and 18% patients in the GClb arm initiated 
treatment for reasons other than those above.

Most patients in each treatment arm had comorbidities in four to eight organ systems (Clb arm: 90/118 
patients [76%] vs. GClb arm: 192/238 patients [81%]). The majority of patients in each treatment arm 
had organ system severity scores of < 3 (as assessed by the CIRS definition), 88/118 patients (75%) Clb 
versus 181/238 (76%) GClb. Overall, 31/118 patients (26%) in the Clb arm and 57/238 (24%) in the 
GClb arm had comorbidities in all three of the most common organ systems (Hypertension, 
Endocrine/Metabolic and Cardiac), and most patients in each study arm (Clb arm: 105/118 patients 
[89%] vs. GClb: 209/238 patients [88%]) had one of the three most common comorbidities.

Numbers analysed 
The primary population for the Stage 1a analyses was the ITT population which comprised all patients 
randomized to the Clb and GClb arms, regardless of whether they received treatment or not, and included 
118 patients in the Clb arm and 238 patients in the GClb arm. 
The primary population for the Stage 1b analyses was the ITT population which comprised all patients 
randomized to the Clb and RClb arms, regardless of whether they received treatment or not, and included 
118 patients in the Clb arm and 233 patients in the RClb arm. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The efficacy results for Stage 1a are summarized in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 61/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 19 and Figure 5 (investigator’s assessment; cut-off 11 July 2012),  
Table 20 and 6 (independent review committee).  
The overall median observation time (randomization to last available assessment), at the time of data 
cutoff was 14.2 months overall; 13.6 months (range: 0.2-26.8 months) for patients in the Clb arm and 
14.5 months (range: 0.1-26.7 months) for patients in the GClb arm. There were 65/118 patients (55%) 
in the Clb arm and 141/238 patients (59%) in the GClb arm who had been followed for at least 12 months. 
At data cutoff, a total of 16/356 patients (4%) had been followed for more than 2 years.  
Closed Test Procedure 
At the time of the Stage 1a analysis, a global test was conducted by the independent Data Coordinating 
Center (iDCC), and the p-value was communicated to the Sponsor through the DSMB in order to protect 
the integrity of the trial (i.e., the Sponsor did not have access to RClb data at the time of the Stage 1a 
analysis). 
The  p-value  of  the  global  test  for  any  difference  between  the  three  treatment  arms,  via  a  three-arm 
log-rank test was <0.0001. According to the closed test principle, the adjusted p-value for the pairwise 
comparison is defined as the maximum of the p-value of the global test and the p-value of the pairwise 
comparison. In this case, both p-values are <0.0001 which means that the adjusted p-value is <0.0001. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
All pre-specified sensitivity analyses conducted were supportive of the results from the primary analysis 
of PFS (data not shown); the HRs for the sensitivity analyses ranged from 0.12 to 0.26. 
Progression-Free Survival Subgroup Analyses 
A summary of efficacy subgroup analyses is presented in Figures 7-8. 
In order to assess the impact of potential prognostic factors on the treatment effect, pre−defined baseline 
characteristics and prognostic factors were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses 
for PFS confirmed the advantage of GClb over Clb. The HR was 0.14 in a multivariate Cox regression 
including all covariates listed in Fig. 6 and ranged from 0.13−0.16 for the univariate Cox regressions 
(including each covariate and treatment, no interaction term).  
Updated results 
Updated  Stage  1a  results  (ITT;  cut-off  9  May  2013,  22.8  months  median  observation  time)  are 
summarized in Table 21 and Figure 9.

Note: The most common reason for disease progression based on investigator assessment was increasing lymphocyte 
count (Clb: 45%; GClb: 40%); increasing/new lymphadenopathy (Clb: 25%; GClb: 37%) was also a common reason. 
Other reasons of disease progression experienced by less than 10% of the patients were increasing new hepatomegaly 
or splenomegaly and progressive cytopenia. No disease progressions were due to transformation to new histology.

Stage 1a (ITT; cut-off 11 July 2012, Study BO21004/CLL11) 
Note: Molecular remission at end of treatment was to be assessed for all patients using a blood sample. Additionally, a bone marrow 
sample was obtained from patients whom the investigator assumed to have a complete response, consistent with the IWCLL guidelines. 
A combined analysis of blood and bone marrow results was conducted and an MRD-positive patient was defined as a patient who was 
positive in either blood or bone marrow. MRD was considered negative if result was less than 1 CLL cell in 10000 leukocytes (MRD value 
< 0.0001) based on the method of allele specific polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR). Patients for whom no end of treatment MRD 
result was available but who had progressed or died before end of treatment were counted as positive. Patients with a missing result but 
who had not experienced PD or death, were not included in the MRD-positive patients; they were excluded from the analysis (26/118 
patients [22%] in the Clb arm and 70/238 patients [29%] in the GClb arm). The reasons for missing samples included early 
discontinuation/withdrawal of therapy or consent, samples not taken or analyzed due to issues with a particular sample or assay. In 
addition, 12/118 patients (10%) in the Clb arm and 26/238 patients (11%) in GClb arm were excluded from the analyses of response 
rates and MRD due to not reaching the end of treatment response assessment at the time of clinical cutoff.

Figure 10: Kaplan-Meier plot of overall survival - Stage 1a (ITT; cut-off 11 July 2012, Study 
BO21004/CLL11) 
Note: In the updated analysis at the clinical data cut-off date, a total of 46 randomized patients had died; 24/118 patients (20.3%) in 
the Clb arm and 22/238 patients (9.2%) in the GClb arm. The median survival time was not reached in either treatment arm and the 
overall survival data are therefore still preliminary due to the low number of events. The stratified hazard ratio was 0.41 (95% CI 
[0.23; 0.74], stratified log-rank test p-value 0.0022).

Note: In the Clb arm, 79/118 patients (66.9%) had experienced an EFS event (PD, death or start of new anti-leukemic treatment) 
compared to 64/238 patients (26.9%) in the GClb arm). HR: 0.18 [CI: 0.13, 0.26]. The median EFS was 23.0 months in the GClb arm 
compared to 10.6 months in the Clb arm.

Note: The disease-free survival was assessed in patients with a best response of CR/Cri at anytime from 56 days after end of treatment. 
Two out of 118 patients in the Clb arm and 59 out of 238 patients in the GClb arm were included in the DFS analysis. In the Clb arm, 
one patient out of 2 and in the GClb arm, 3 out of 59 patients (5.1%) had progressed by the clinical cutoff date.

Table 31: Time to new anti-leukemic treatment (ITT; Stage 1a update, cut-off 9 May, 2013, Study 
BO21004/CLL11) 
Note: At the time of the primary efficay analysis (cut-off 11 July 2012), 41/118 patients (34.7%) in the Clb arm and 29/238 patients (12.2%) in the GClb arm 
had started a new anti-leukemia treatment. The risk of receiving a new anti-leukemia therapy was significantly reduced in the GClb arm compared to the Clb 
arm (stratified HR = 0.26 [95% CI: 0.16, 0.42]; p-value < 0.0001, logrank test). The median time to new anti-leukemia treatment could not be estimated in 
the GClb arm. In the Clb arm, it was 14.8 months. After disease progression, 30/118 patients (25%) in the Clb arm and 12/238 patients (5%) in the GClb arm 
received new anti-leukemic treatments, mainly monoclonal antibodies (Clb arm: 19% patients vs. GClb arm: 2% patients), alkylating agents (Clb arm: 10% 
patients vs. GClb arm: 3% patients) and anti-neoplastic agents (including combination therapies of treatments in these classes) (Clb arm: 7% patients vs. 
GClb arm: <1% patients).  Eleven of the 118 patients (9%) in the Clb arm and 17/238 patients (7%) in the GClb arm received new anti-leukemic treatments 
before progression, mainly alkylating agents (Clb arm: 7% patients vs. GClb arm: 6% patients) and monoclonal antibodies (Clb arm: 3% patients vs. GClb 
arm: 2% patients), including combination therapies of treatments in these classes. 
Patient reported outcomes 
In the EORTC QLQC30 and QLQ-CLL-16 questionnaires conducted during the treatment period, no 
substantial difference in any of the subscales was observed (data not shown). Data during follow up, 
especially for the chlorambucil alone arm, were limited. However, no notable differences in quality of life 
during follow up have been identified to date (SmPC, section 5.1). Health-related quality of life 
assessments, specific to fatigue through treatment period, showed no statistically significant difference 
suggesting that the addition of obinutuzumab to a chlorambucil regimen did not increase the experience 
of fatigue for patients (SmPC, section 5.1). Immunogenicity Patients in the pivotal study BO21004/CLL11 
were tested at multiple time-points for anti therapeutic antibodies (ATA) to obinutuzumab. In patients 
treated with obinutuzumab 8 out of 140 patients in the randomized phase and 2 out of 6 in the run in 
phase tested positive for ATA at 12 months of follow up. Of these patients, none experienced anaphylactic 
or hypersensitivity reactions that were considered related to ATA, nor was clinical response affected 
(SmPC, section 5.1). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 77/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and 
specificity, assay methodology, assay robustness to quantities of obinutuzumab in the circulation, sample 
handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medicines and underlying disease. For these reasons, 
comparison of incidence of antibodies to obinutuzumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products 
may be misleading (SmPC, section 5.1).

Supportive Phase I/II Studies (BO20999, BO21003, BO21000, JO21900) 
Supportive clinical safety, PK and pharmacodynamic data come from the pivotal BO21004/CLL11 study in 
CLL and from four other Phase I/II studies of obinutuzumab in CD20-positive hematological malignancies, 
as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Study BO20999: an open-label dose-escalating Phase I/randomized Phase II study of obinutuzumab 
as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CD20-positive malignancies. The objective of 
the Phase II part was to compare the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab in  relapsed/refractory 
iNHL/aNHL (2 doses) or relapsed/refractory CLL (1 dose). 
Study BO21003: an open-label dose-escalating Phase I/randomized Phase II study of obinutuzumab 
as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CD20-positive malignant disease. The objective 
of  the  Phase II  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  obinutuzumab  versus  rituximab  in  patients  with 
CD20-positive relapsed iNHL. 
Study BO21000:  an  open-label  Phase Ib  study  of  obinutuzumab 
in  combination  with 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (CHOP) or FC as treatment for patients 
with  CD20-positive  B-cell  relapsed/refractory  follicular  lymphoma  and  the  combination  of 
obinutuzumab  with  CHOP  or  bendamustine  in  patients  with  previously  untreated  follicular 
lymphoma. 
Study JO21900:  a  Phase I  study  conducted  in  Japan  by  Chugai  Pharmaceutical  Co.  Ltd  of 
obinutuzumab as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CD20-positive B-cell NHL only 
(design similar to Phase I part of study BO20999).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A Phase III international, multicentre, open label, randomiszed, two-stage, three-arm clinical study 
(BO21004/CLL11) investigating the efficacy and safety of Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil (GClb) compared to 
rituximab plus chlorambucil (RClb) or chlorambucil (Clb) alone was conducted in patients with previously 
untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with comorbidities (SmPC, section 5.1).  
A total of 781 patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil, rituximab plus 
chlorambucil or chlorambucil alone. Stage 1a compared Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil to chlorambucil alone 
in 356 patients and Stage 2 compared Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil to rituximab plus chlorambucil in 663 
patients (SmPC, section 5.1). 
Stratification was performed based on the most important factors that were considered to have the 
potential to impact the safety and efficacy analyses i.e. Binet stage (A, B or C), which is acknowledged as 
the most important prognostic factor for CLL patients and region to ensure a balance across the treatment 
arms with respect to clinical practice. With only 118 patients randomized to the Chlorambucil arm, it 
would not have been efficient to include additional stratification factors (e.g., CIRS > 6 and ClCr <70 
ml/min versus CIRS > 6 or ClCr <70 ml/min). Nevertheless, important imbalances in prognostic factors 
were not observed and adjusted analyses showed no important differnces in the estimation of the 
treatment effect. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 86/123 
 
 
 
 
 
There was a difference of 5% between the treatment arms in the proportion of patients with ZAP 70 
positive disease. This small imbalance of a negative prognostic factor (ZAP 70 positivity) in Clb-treated 
patients was considered unlikely have biased the results in favour of obinutuzumab. Updated PFS results 
for ZAP 70 positive and ZAP 70 negative subgroups of patients were consistent with the ITT population 
(data not shown). In the ZAP 70 positive subgroup (i.e. prognostically potentially worse), there was a 
trend in favor of GClb, (HR=0.81; 95% CI: 0.33; 1.99, stratified log-rank test p-value 0.6448). The CHMP 
considered that a possible benefit in OS should be confirmed and that the mature data should be 
submitted when available (see conclusions on clinical efficacy).  
For the positioning of obinutuzumab a comparison with rituximab was necessary since it is now widely 
recognized that the addition of rituximab to any effective chemotherapy for CLL will improve PFS, ORR 
(and in some settings also OS). In that respect the comparator arm with chlorambucil was considered of 
reduced clinical interest.  
In the majority of patients, Gazyvaro was given intravenously as a 1,000 mg initial dose administered on 
Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of the first treatment cycle. In order to reduce the rate of infusion reactions in 
patients, an amendment was implemented and 140 patients received the first Gazyvaro dose 
administered over 2 days ([Day 1 [(100 mg]) and Day 2 [(900 mg]))] (see section 4.2 and 4.4). For each 
subsequent treatment cycle (Cycles 2 to 6), patients received Gazyvaro 1,000 mg on Day 1 only. 
Chlorambucil was given orally at 0.5 mg/kg body weight on Day 1 and Day 15 of all treatment cycles (1 
to 6). 
The demographics data and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups. 
The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and male (61%). The median age was 73 years, with 44% 
being 75 years or older. At baseline, 22% of patients had Binet Stage A, 42% had Binet Stage B and 36% 
had Binet Stage C. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Part 1a of study BO21004 has provided convincing evidence of efficacy of obinutuzumab with a clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint PFS, compared to 
chlorambucil alone, in previously untreated CLL patients with coexisting medical conditions and/or renal 
impairment. The risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 86% when obinutuzumab was given 
with chlorambucil (HR = 0.18, 95% CI [0.13; 0.24]; log-rank p-value < 0.0001).  There was a good 
concordance between investigator and IRC assessment of PFS, and the finding of primary analysis was 
supported by all relevant sensitivity analyses. Thus, the efficacy results were considered robust.  
All secondary endpoints with mature data, including EFS, overall response rates, CR rates, achievement 
of MRD-negative status, duration of response and time to new treatment, supported the primary efficacy 
endpoint and favored the GClb arm compared to the Clb arm. 
OS data were still immature but the stratified hazard ratio was 0.41 (95% CI [0.23; 0.74], stratified 
log-rank test p-value 0.0022). 
Overall, the baseline demographics and prognostic factors were well balanced although some imbalances 
were noted. It seems unlikely that such imbalances should influence the overall very convincing efficacy 
results.

The BO21004/CLL11 study population included patients with varying coexisting medical conditions with 
one defining common characteristic; the patients were physically fit enough to tolerate an anti-CD20 
antibody infusion but they were not fit enough to tolerate the toxicity associated with full dose 
fludarabine. Prior to enrolment, patients had to have documented CD20+ CLL, and one or both of the 
following measures of coexisting medical conditions: comorbidity score (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale 
(CIRS)) of greater than 6 or reduced renal function as measured by CrCl <70 mL/min. Patients with 
inadequate liver function (National Cancer Institute – Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
Grade 3 liver function tests (AST, ALT > 5 x ULN for > 2 weeks; Bbilirubin > 3 x ULN) and renal function 
(CrCl < 30 mL/min) were excluded. Patients with one or more individual organ/system impairment score 
of 4 as assessed by the CIRS definition, excluding Eeyes, Eears, nose, throat and larynx organ system, 
were excluded. The median comorbidity score was 8 and 76% of the patients enrolled had a comorbidity 
score above 6. The median estimated CrCl was 62 mL/min and 66% of all patients had a CrCl < 70 
mLl/min. Forty-two percent of patients enrolled had both a CrCl < 70 mLl/min and a comorbidity score of 
> 6. Thirty-four percent of patients were enrolled on comorbidity score alone, and 23% of patients were 
enrolled with only impaired renal function.  
The most frequently reported coexisting medical conditions (using a cut off of 30% or higher), in the 
MedDRA body systems were: vascular disorders (73%), cardiac disorders (46%), gastrointestinal 
disorders (38%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (40%), renal and urinary disorders (38%), 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (33%)(SmPC, section 5.1). To reflect this, the indication 
(SmPC, section 4.1) has been restricted to treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and with co morbidities making them unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine 
based therapy. A cross reference to the SmPC section 5.1 has been included in the indication to describe 
the key inclusion criteria of the pivotal study.  
During the initial evaluation, the CHMP raised a major objection about the indication needing to be further 
discussed, with reference to “frail” patients (CIRS score >6 and CrCl <70 ml/min) and “unfit” patients 
(CIRS score >6 or CrCl <70 ml/min; these patients could, according to the some treatment guidelines, 
have received a more aggressive treatment than Cbl alone, in particular RCbl, or other drugs, like 
bendamustine or reduced dose RFC). However, it was also acknowledged that Clb was an acceptable 
comparator treatment for these patients since there was no phase III evidence that the addition of an 
anti-CD20 antibody to Clb would improve outcome. Based on further subgroup analyses in the “frail” and 
“unfit” patients, a strongly positive effect was observed with GClb against Cbl alone and RCbl throughout 
a number of efficacy analyses and endpoints without major differences in toxicity.  
To further support this, the Applicant will submit the OS mature data when available in order to confirm 
the benefit of GClb over RClb for this endpoint (see conclusions on clinical efficacy). 
Results of the PFS subgroup analysis (i.e. sex, age, Binet stages, CrCl, CIRS score, beta2-microglobulin, 
IGVH status, chromosomal abnormalities, lymphocyte count at baseline) were consistent with the results 
seen in the overall Intent-to-Treat population. The risk of disease progression or death was reduced in the 
GClb arm compared to the RClb arm and Clb alone arm in all subgroups except for the subgroup of 
patients with deletion 17p, for which no benefit was observed compared to RClb. For subgroups, reduction 
of the risk of disease progression or death ranged from 92% to 58% for GClb versus Clb and 72% to 29% 
for GClb versus RClb (SmPC, section 5.1). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 88/123 
 
 
 
 
 
There were strict criteria for crossing over to the GClb arm and cross over was at the Investigator’s 
discretion. At the cutoff date for the primary Stage 1a analysis (11 July, 2012), 22/118 patients (19%) 
had crossed over from Clb to receive GClb. At the cutoff date for the updated Stage 1a analysis (9 May, 
2013), a further 8 patients had crossed over from Clb to GClb, increasing the final number of patients who 
crossed over from Clb to GClb to 30/118 patients (25%). There were 27 patients (23% patients overall) 
who, despite fulfilling the criteria, did not cross over to receive GClb of which 16 received alternative 
treatments like bendamustine and rituximab.  
Although only 26 patients with del17p were included in the stage 1 a study (10 in Clb arm and 16 in GClb 
arm) the results indicate that GClb has limited activity in that subpopulation (SmPC, section 5.1). The 
availability of newer agents with reported high activity in del(17p) CLL such as ibrutinib and idelalisib 
further strengthen the need for information on the activity of obinutuzumab in that particular subset.   
The chlorambucil dose in BO 21004 trial was relatively low (0.5 mg/kg body weight of Clb given orally on 
Day 1 and Day 15 of all treatment cycles, Cycle 1 – 6). Dose escalation could have been medically 
indicated in 4 of the 9 patients who experienced PD prior to receiving 6 cycles of chlorambucil and in 7 
patients with stable disease. Although dosing could have been suboptimal in these patients, this is not 
expected to lead to significant over-estimation of the treatment effect associated with obinutuzumab. 
HRQoL data are of limited value due to the open-label design of the study. Blinding was considered 
impractical due to the different regimens for obinituzumab (given three times in Cycle 1 at a flat dose of 
1000 mg and on Day 1 of subsequent cycles) and rituximab (given once per cycle at 375 mg/m²). Despite 
their limited value the HRQoL data can still be a useful part of the overall benefit-risk estimation. While 
certain safety events occurred in a higher incidence in the ‘frail’ population, thus potentially impacting 
QoL, these safety events are well-known and therefore manageable. Together with the maintenance of 
the HRQoL outcomes one could conclude that treatment with Obinutuzumab did not negatively impact 
QoL. However, an improvement of QOL in the study population has not been established. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study BO21004 has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of obinutuzumab in terms of the 
primary endpoint PFS, compared to chlorambucil alone, in previously untreated CLL patients with 
coexisting medical conditions and/or renal impairment. The addition of obinutuzumab to Clb resulted in a 
clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of PFS compared to 
RClb.   
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
The applicant will submit by 31 January 2016, the OS mature data of stage 2 in order to confirm the 
benefit of GClb for this endpoint. Subgroup OS analyses in the frail and unfit subsets will also be provided. 
The Applicant will submit by 31 January 2016 the OS mature data of stage 1a in the ITT population, in the 
subgroups of ZAP70 positive patients and ZAP70 negative patients (see section 4). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data from stage 1 of this pivotal study, BO21004/CLL11, comparing the efficacy and safety of 
obinutuzumab + chlorambucil (GClb), rituximab + chlorambucil (RClb), or chlorambucil alone (Clb) in 
previously untreated CLL patients with comorbidities, have been submitted. Four additional supporting 
studies provided additional safety data using a different treatment approach in a somewhat different 
population i.e. obinutuzumab as monotherapy in relapsed/refractory CLL patients and relapsed/refractory 
NHL patients and obinutuzumab + chemotherapy (G-CHOP or G-FC) in follicular lymphoma patients.

Patient exposure 
All patients in the pivotal study in the GClb arm were treated with the proposed dose of 1000 mg 
obinutuzumab and 0.5 mg/kg body weight of Clb. More than 75% of the patients received the 
recommended 8 cycles of treatment with obinutuzumab i.e. approximately 6 months of treatment. A 
greater percentage of patients in the GClb arm received all 6 cycles of planned treatment compared to the 
Clb arm (Clb arm: 67% patients vs. GClb arm: 81% patients) (SmPC, section 4.8). The treatment arms 
were similar with respect to the percentage of patients who received only one cycle of treatment (Clb 
arm: 10% patients vs. GClb arm: 11% patients). However, a greater proportion of patients in the Clb arm 
withdrew, particularly at Cycles 2, 3 and 4).  
The median cumulative dose of Clb in each treatment arm was similar with 384.0 mg in the Clb arm 
(range: 28.0−672.0 mg) and 370.0 mg in the GClb arm (range: 22.0 mg−1440.0 mg). The median 
cumulative dose of obinutuzumab in the GClb arm was 8000.0 mg (range: 2.0−26000.0 mg). The highest 
reported dose of 26000 mg was a data entry error; this patient was confirmed to have received 8 × 1000 
mg infusion rather than 6 × 1000mg plus 2 × 10,000mg. The median exposure time was 6.0 months in 
the Clb arm (range: 1.0−7.4 months) and 5.6 months in the GClb arm (range: 1.0−9.0 months).

GClb = obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil 
Adverse events  
The intensity of all adverse events was graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. 
Almost all patients in the pivotal study experienced adverse events, 82% in the Clb arm vs. 93% in the 
GClb arm. The differences in frequency of adverse events between the two arm were mainly due to 
differences in infusion related adverse events (IRRs), neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. 
These adverse events were also the most common adverse events along with infections and 
gastrointestinal disorders. This is not unexpected knowing the safety profile of chlorambucil and 
anti-CD20 antibodies. Grade 3-5 adverse events occurred more frequently in the GClb arm (69%) vs. Clb 
arm (47%) and were primarily due to IRRs, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. However, In 
study BO21004 Stage 1a, 21% (51/240) patients received prophylactic treatment with anti-infective 
medications and G-CSF in GClb arm compared to 11% (13/116) in Clb arm. From study Day 1 onwards, 
a higher proportion of patients in the GClb arm were treated with anti-infective medications and G CSF 
(74%; 178/240) compared to the Clb arm (56%; 65/116). 
The difference in the percentage of patients having received prophylactic treatment with anti-infective 
medications and G-CSF is the most plausible explanation for infections and febrile neutropenia to have 
occurred more frequently in the Clb arm, though the fact that GClb is more efficient could also have 
attributed.  
A summary of stage 1a and stage 1b of the pivotal study key safety findings is presented in Table 39.

The adverse events occurring with a ≥2% increased incidence in the GClb arm compared with the Clb arm 
are shown in Table 40.  
In Stage 2 of the pivotal study (GClb vs. RClb) the incidence of all grade adverse events (RClb arm: 89%  
patients vs. GClb arm: 94% patients), adverse events leading to withdrawal from any study medication 
(RClb arm: 8% patients vs. GClb arm: 13% patients), serious adverse events (RClb arm: 32% patients 
vs. GClb arm: 39% patients) and Grade 3-5 adverse events (RClb arm: 55% patients vs. GClb arm: 70% 
patient) were all higher in the GClb arm. This imbalance was mainly due to IRRs (38% in RClb versus 66% 
in GClb), neutropenia (32% versus 38%), thrombocytopenia (7% versus 14%), and TLS (0% versus 
4%).  The majority of IRRs were Grade 1 or 2 and there were no Grade 5 IRRs in this study.  The 
difference in the incidence of neutropenic adverse events between the treatment arms (33% versus 42%) 
was driven by Grade 4 events (11% versus 18%).  No Grade 5 neutropenic events occurred in either arm. 
The incidence of infection in patients with neutropenic adverse events was comparable in the RClb 
[48/106 (45%)] and GClb arms [68/141 (48%)]. More patients in the GClb arm (21% or 72/336) 
received prophylactic treatment with anti-infective medications and G-CSF in GClb arm as compared to 
the RClb arm (19% or 62/321). The adverse events occurring with a ≥2% increased incidence in the GClb 
arm compared with the RClb arm are shown in Table 41. 
In the supportive studies, the pattern and frequency of Grade 3-5 adverse events in the CLL population 
was almost identical to that of the CLL population in the pivotal study. In the other populations, 
monotherapy NHL and chemocombination therapy populations, the frequency of the most common 
adverse events were different, typically lower. An overview of the safety profile in the supportive studies 
is shown in table 40.

Adverse drug reactions  
The most frequently observed ADRs in patients receiving obinutuzumab were IRRs, which occurred in the 
majority of patients during the first cycle. The incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased 
substantially from 65% with the infusion of the first 1,000 mg of Gazyvaro to less than 3% with 
subsequent infusions (SmPC, see section 4.8).

with the comparator in either all grade or grade 3-5 AEs. All AEs that were observed at least 2% higher 
incidence in at least one of the four comparisons were included as ADRs in the SmPC. Table 4 in the SmPC 
includes the information of the frequency always for all grade and grade 3-5; overall frequency 
assessment is based on the highest frequency of Stage 1a or Stage 2.

Note: For a history of the amendments, see discussion on clinical safety. 
Based on the mode of action of obinutuzumab and the established safety profiles of other anti-CD20 mAbs 
including rituximab, the adverse events of neutropenia, infection, IRRs and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) 
were  defined  as  events  of  particular  interest  in  the  obinutuzumab  clinical  development  program. 
Thrombocytopenia and secondary malignancies occurring within 6 months after first drug intake were 
considered as additional events to monitor.

Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS) 
A higher incidence of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) was observed in the GClb arm (10 patients [4%]; 4 
Grade 3-4, 3 serious) than in the Clb arm (1 patient, 1%; Grade 2). Stage 2 results confirmed the higher 
incidence of TLS observed in the GClb arm during the stage 1. In pooled obinutuzumab monotherapy 
studies  (BO20999  and  BO21003)  in  relapsed/refractory  patients,  four  serious  events  of  TLS  were 
reported; 3 (1%) in the NHL population and 1 (3%) in the CLL population. One serious event of TLS was 
reported in each of the two Phase III blinded studies BO21223 and BO21005 in the NHL population and in 
Study GAO4779g in the CLL population. Most TLS events were either Grade 3 or Grade 4. There were no 
Grade 5 events of TLS (Risk Management Plan). 
Neutropenia, late onset and prolonged neutropenia  
Severe and life-threatening neutropenia including febrile neutropenia has been reported during treatment 
with obintuzumab. The incidence of neutropenia was higher in the obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil arm 
compared to the rituximab plus chlorambucil arm with the neutropenia resolving spontaneously or with 
use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors. The incidence of infection was 38% in the obinutuzumab 
plus chlorambucil arm and 37% in the rituximab plus chlorambucil arm (with Grade 3-5 events reported 
in 12% and 14%, respectively and fatal events reported in < 1% in both treatment arms).  
Late onset neutropenia was reported in 37 patients (17%) in the GClb arm and 10 patients (11%) in the 
Clb arm in Stage 1a of Study BO21004. The median time to recovery was 71 days in the GClb and 55 days 
in the Clb arm. The maximum time to recovery was 183 days in the GClb arm and 196 days in the Clb arm. 
By the cut-off date of the Stage 2 analysis, late onset neutropenia had been reported in 47/366 patients 
(16%) in the GClb arm and 35/321 patients in the RClb arm (12%) (SmPC, section 4.8). The median time 
to recovery in the patients in the Glb arm was 71 days, while the maximum time to recovery was 183 days. 
In the RClb arm, the median time to recovery was 63 days, and the maximum time to recovery was 400 
days (Risk Management Plan). 
Infections and B-cell depletion  
Infections were not more frequent in the GClb arm (10%) than in the Clb arm (14%) and there were no 
deaths in the GClb arm due to infection.  
In Study BO21004, fatal infections were reported in 5% of the population receiving Clb. Two cases of 
infection with a fatal outcome (in 1% of patients) had been reported in the obinutuzumab arm in this 
study  at  the  time  of  the  Stage  2  analysis.  Neutropenic  patients  in  the  GClb  arm  (21%)  received 
prophylaxis and treatment with anti-infective medications and G-CSF more frequently than patients in the 
Clb  (11%)  or  RClb  (19%)  arms.  Two  fatal  cases  were  reported  in  the  pooled  monotherapy  studies 
BO20999 and BO21003; one in the CLL (3%) and one in the NHL ( < 1%) cohort. In the first line NHL 
population receiving concomitant bendamustine (GAO4753g, all population, blinded data), 4 out of 188 
patients (2.1%) experienced fatal infections. There were two other fatal cases reported in blinded Phase 
III studies, one in Study BO21005 and one in Study BO21223 (Risk Management Plan). 
B-cell depletion, if prolonged, may theoretically increase the risk of infection, including serious infections. 
In Study BO21004 (Stage 2 analysis), B-cell depletion data was analyzed for all patients in the GClb arm 
who had B-cell assessments during follow-up. Within 12-18 months after the end of treatment, 52 of 80 
GClb patients with available assessments during this period were still depleted. Five patients experienced 
serious infections and 18 of these 52 patients experienced nonserious infections. However, none started 
more than 12 months after the end of treatment. The onset date was before this timepoint for all events. 
Within 18-24 months after the end of treatment, 21 of 29 GClb patients with available assessments during 
this period were still depleted. One patient had experienced a serious infection (this case was reported 
within the 12-18 month period) and 8 patients had experienced non-serious infections. Beyond 24 
months, 6 of 9 GClb patients with available assessments during this period were still depleted. No serious 
infections were reported in these patients. Two of these 9 patients experienced non-serious infections 
(Risk Management Plan).

One case of PML occurred in Study BO21000 (relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma). B cell depletion 
could have contributed to this event. B cell depletion could contribute to hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
reactivation. In the obinutuzumab programme two patients in trial BO21005 exposed to obinutuzumab 
experienced laboratory hepatitis B reactivation without any signs or symptoms of clinical hepatitis or any 
liver function test abnormalities.  
Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently and the incidence of Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was 
higher in the GClb arm than the Clb arm. However, this did result in an increased risk of bleeding.  
Thrombocytopenia was asymptomatic and resolved spontaneously in the majority of patients. A small 
number of patients (≤4 patients per study, ≤3%) experienced serious thrombocytopenia across all 
obinutuzumab trials irrespective of the population and indication (Risk Management Plan). The incidence 
of serious acute thrombocytopenia (i.e., thrombocytopenia occurring within 24 hours of obinutuzumab 
infusion) was ≤1% in all studies (Risk Management Plan). Three fatal thrombocytopenia events have been 
reported, all in patients enrolled in Study BO21005 who received obinutuzumab with concomitant CHOP 
chemotherapy. All three cases developed during the first cycle (Risk Management Plan). The overall 
incidence of hemorrhagic adverse events was 7% RClb vs. 8% GClb with the majority of events being of 
Grade 1 or 2 severity. The number of Grade 5 hemorrhagic events was 3 RClb vs 4 GClb (Risk 
Management Plan). 
Secondary malignancies  
Secondary malignancies occurred in all treatment groups in both the pivotal and supportive studies. 
Meylodysplastic syndrome occurred in almost all treatment groups. Secondary malignancies, in the 
pivotal study, were diagnosed in 2 patients (2%, lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma) in the 
Clb arm, and in 7 patients (3%) with 9 second malignancies in the GClb arm: rectal cancer, prostate 
cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome, keratocanthoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of 
skin (2 events) and squamous cell carcinoma (2 events). In the supporting studies, the total incidence of 
second malignancies was 5% in the monotherapy CLL and NHL populations, and 4% in the 
chemo-combination therapy population.  
By the cut-off date for the Stage 2 analysis of Study BO21004 (GClb vs. RClb), the incidence of second 
malignancies was 4% in the GClb arm, with 17 events reported in 13 patients. The proportion of patients 
who experienced second malignancies 6 months after starting treatment or later was identical in the GClb 
and RClb arms (4%), however, more skin cancers were seen in the GClb arm. Of the 8 patients with skin 
cancers in the GClb arm, 5 had squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, 2 had basal cell carcinoma and 1 
patient had keratoacanthoma. Of the 8 patients, three had a medical history of skin cancer. All 8 patients 
were over 70 years of age and the majority were from countries with a high incidence of skin cancers. 
Most of the skin lesions were reported in sun-exposed body parts such as ears, forearms, forehead and 
periocular regions. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the pivotal study, more patients died in the Clb arm (8%) than in the GClb arm (5%) overall.   5% in 
the Clb arm and 2% in the GClb arm died because of an adverse event. Of these, 3 cases in the Clb arm 
vs. 1 in the GClb arm were believed to be related to the trial treatment. In the supportive studies only one 
death was considered related to the study drug.

Serious adverse events (SAEs) were experienced by 32% patients (Clb arm) vs. 37% patients (GClb arm) 
in the pivotal study. These were as could be expected: infections, neutropenia incl. febrile neutropenia 
and for the GClb arm, IRRs and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). The same pattern of SAEs was evident in the 
supportive studies, most pronounced for the monotherapy CLL population. 
61% patients in the GClb arm experienced adverse events leading to dose modification of any study 
medication compared to 20% in the Clb arm. The most common reason for the differences was more 
cases of IRRs and neutropenia in the GClb arm. In the supportive studies IRRs were the most common 
reason for dose modification.

In Stage 2 of the pivotal study (GClb vs. RClb) the incidence of death was lower in the GClb arm (RClb 
arm: 12% patients vs. GClb arm: 8% patients and the incidence of fatal adverse events was lower in the 
GClb arm (RClb arm: 6% patients vs. GClb arm: 4% patients).

most frequently reported serious event in each treatment arm (45/321 patients [14%] RClb vs. 42/336

Table 48: Grade 3-5 adverse events that occurred with ≥2% difference between treatment groups (Stage 
1a, study BO21004/CLL11) 
Laboratory findings 
The change in hematology parameters was similar except for a larger decrease in neutrophils and WBC in 
the GClb arm in the pivotal study. In the pivotal study, almost 25% of the GClb patients remained B-cell 
depleted after 18 months. The incidence of B cell depletion at the end of treatment was higher in the GClb 
arm (91%) compared to the RClb arm (24%) in the pivotal study, Stage 2. Thirty-four (34)% of the 
patients exposed to GClb had recovered B cells without PD up to Month 24 after end of treatment. The IgG 
levels were affected in some patients and more so in the GClb arm than in the RClb arm though it did not 
result in an increase in infections.  
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 41% and 15% of patients, respectively, in the pivotal 
study, with the incidence of Grade 3 5 infection being 16% in the obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil arm 
(SmPC, section 4.8). 
In the chemistry laboratory parameter, no notable differences was evident except for ALAT/ASAT and 
alkaline phosphatase where more patients in the GClb arm had a slight increase from baseline compared 
to the Clb arm in the pivotal study  (data not shown). In the supportive studies, increased ALAT/ASAT was 
also seen. However, the increase in ALAT/ASAT was only transient or related to co-morbidity or 
concomitant administered hepatotoxic medicines.

Renal function was affected more in the GClb arm where 6% of the patients had a shift to Grade 3/4 in low 
corrected creatinine clearance compared to 3% of the patients in the Clb arm (data not shown).  Some 
adverse effect on corrected creatinine clearance was also seen in the supportive studies.  With the 
updated data submitted it was shown that two patients treated with GClb had proteinuria but in both 
cases it was unlikely caused by the GClb treatment. Furthermore, patients who had a shift of at least 2 
grades in creatinine from baseline to worst value during treatment in the GClb arm all returned to baseline 
or near baseline creatinine. Obinutuzumab does not seem to cause irreversible changes in creatinine 
levels and thus presumably in creatinine clearance. With the presented data there is nothing to indicate 
that obinutuzumab causes glomerulonephritis.      
Safety in special populations 
Adverse events increased with age and more elderly patients in the GClb arm in the pivotal study 
experienced AE compared with the Clb but a similar proportion experienced serious AEs and AE that lead 
to discontinuation. Patients with a creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min experienced a higher frequency of 
AEs. These were mainly IRRs, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.    
In frail patients (i.e. patients with CIRS > 6 and ClCr <70 mL/min) data form stage 2 of the pivotal study 
(GClb vs. RClb) showed a higher incidence of IRRs in the GClb arm compared with the RClb and 14% vs. 
2% had a serious IRRs.  Additionally, the incidence and severity of infections GClb arm was higher in the 
GClb arm than in the RClb arm (46% vs 39% had an infection and 17% vs 13% had a serious infection). 
Furthermore, 17% in the GClb arm had an unresolved infection vs. 8% in the RClb arm. 
Immunological events 
Human Anti-Human Antibodies (HAHA) can develop even if obinutuzumab is a fully humanized antibody. 
All supportive studies have used a method (first generation assay) for analyzing for HAHAs that was not 
optimal. A second generation assay was used to detect HAHAs in the pivotal study.  Few patients in the 
supportive studies were positive for HAHAs compared with pivotal study (using the second generation 
assay) where 9 of 70 patients (13%) had positive HAHA results. The incidence and severity of the IRRs 
were similar in patients who tested positive for HAHAs and those that did not (data not shown). In stage 
2 of the pivotal study 4/243 patients (2%) tested positive at 6 months, 5/183 patients (3%) tested 
positive at 9 months and 8/140 patients (6%) tested positive at 12 months. 
The effect of immunogenicity to an anti-CD20 mAB on re-exposure to the same antibody or other 
anti-CD20 mAB in patients being treated for hematologic malignancies is unknown but cross-reactivity of 
HAHA developed for one anti-CD20 mAB towards other anti-CD20 mABs is expected to be very low 
because of distinct sequences of CDR regions of different anti-CD20 mABs. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific safety issues related to possible drug-drug interaction were identified (see also discussion on 
clinical pharmacology). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Fifteen (15)% of patients in the Clb arm and 20% in the GClb arm in the pivotal study experienced at least 
one adverse event that led to the withdrawal of any study medication. Thirteen (13)% experienced 
adverse events that led to withdrawal of obinutuzumab. The withdrawals were mainly due to IRRs.  A 
major contributing factor to the difference in withdrawals between the treatment arms was the 
occurrence IRRs of in the GClb arm which led to the withdrawal of 19/240 patients (8%).

In stage 2 of the pivotal study 47/336 patients [14%]in the GClb arm  compared with the RClb arm 
(24/321 patients [7%] withdrew from treatment. . This imbalance was primarily due to the proportion of 
patients in the GClb who were withdrawn because of IRRs (25/336 patients [7%]) compared with the 
RClb arm (3/321 patients [< 1%]).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  obinutuzumab  was  not  unexpected,  as  it  is  an  anti-CD20  antibody,  with 
infusion-related  reactions  (IRRs),  neutropenia  and  infections  being  the  most  common  adverse  events 
including SEAs and Grade 3-5 AEs. However, most AEs were manageable.   
From the safety database a summary of ADRs reported with a higher incidence (difference of ≥2%) in 
patients receiving obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil as compared to chlorambucil alone or rituximab plus 
chlorambucil (Study BO21004/CLL11), have been included in the SmPC (see SmPC, section 4.8). 
Obinutuzumab + Chlorambucil (GClb) vs. Chlorambucil (Clb) resulted in more adverse events in the GClb 
treated population but there was almost the same frequency of SAEs in the two arms and fewer patients 
died due to AE in the GClb arm.  
Infusion Related Reactions (IRRs), hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis 
The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving obinutuzumab were 
IRRs, which occurred predominantly during infusion of the first 1,000 mg (SmPC, section 4.4). Most cases 
of IRRs occurred within the first 5 hours of infusion. The incidence of IRRs was 65% with the infusion of 
the first 1,000 mg of obinutuzumab (20% of patients experiencing a Grade 3 5 IRR, with no fatal events 
reported). Overall, 7% of patients experienced an IRR leading to discontinuation of obinutuzumab. The 
incidence of IRRs with subsequent infusions was 3% with the second 1,000 mg dose and 1% thereafter. 
No Grade 3 5 IRRs were reported beyond the first 1,000 mg infusions of Cycle 1 (SmPC, section 4.8). 
In the majority of patients, IRRs were mild to moderate and could be managed by the slowing or 
temporary halting of the first infusion, but severe and life threatening IRRs requiring symptomatic 
treatment have also been reported. IRRs may be clinically indistinguishable from immunoglobulin E (IgE) 
mediated allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis) (SmPC, section 4.4).  
Most frequently reported symptoms associated with an IRR were nausea, chills, hypotension, pyrexia, 
vomiting, dyspnoea, flushing, hypertension, headache, tachycardia, and diarrhoea. Respiratory and 
cardiac symptoms such as bronchospasm, larynx and throat irritation, wheezing, laryngeal oedema and 
atrial fibrillation have also been reported (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Anaphylaxis has been reported in patients treated with obintuzumab. Hypersensitivity may be difficult to 
distinguish from IRRs. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected during infusion (e.g. symptoms typically 
occurring after previous exposure and very rarely with the first infusion), the infusion must be stopped 
and treatment permanently discontinued. Patients with known IgE mediated hypersensitivity to 
obinutuzumab must not be treated (SmPC, section 4.4). Gazyvaro is contraindicated in case of 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 of the SmPC 
(SmPC, section 4.3).

Several protocol amendments have been made in an attempt to decrease the incidence and severity of 
IRRs and to also decrease the number of discontinuations due to IRRs. Protocol version G (dated 9 
December 2011) was introduced after an amendment to further reduce IRRs. The advice from the DSMB 
had been that the first obinutuzumab infusion should be administered very slowly. To accommodate the 
recommendation for a slow initial rate of infusion of the 1000-mg dose on Cycle 1, Day 1, it was decided 
that the infusion would now be given over two days. Thus, it became mandatory to split the first infusion 
of obinutuzumab over two days for all patients (100 mg on Day1 and 900 mg on Day 2). The amendment 
was implemented through a “Dear Healthcare Professional Letter” dated 18 October 2011. Following the 
introduction of slow infusion rate and mandatory split of the first dose (in addition to other measures 
previously taken: patients with high circulating lymphocyte count >25 x 109/L received corticosteroids as 
premedication; premedication requirements were modified to include corticosteroids for all patients 
during the first infusion; antihypertensive drugs had to be paused, other guidance and optional split 
dose), the incidence of all grade IRRs decreased. The overall incidence of IRRs in Stage 2 was 52.9% in 
patients receiving the split dose infusion on C1D1 compared with 61.1% in patients enrolled before this 
amendment. The incidence of serious IRRs also decreased after this amendment (8.3% vs. 6.4%). In 
patients who received the combined measures for prevention of IRRs (adequate glucocorticoid, oral 
analgesic/anti-histamine, omission of antihypertensive medicine in the morning of the first infusion, and 
the Cycle 1 Day 1 dose administered over 2 days) as described in section 4.2 of the SmPC, a decreased 
incidence of all Grades IRRs was observed (SmPC, section 4.4).  
The rates of Grade 3 4 IRRs (which were based on a relatively small number of patients) were similar 
before and after mitigation measures were implemented (SmPC, section 4.4). The proportion of patients 
experiencing Grade 3-4 IRRs was 13.9% vs. 17.1%, before and after implementation of these 
amendments, respectively; the proportion of patients experiencing IRRs leading to treatment 
discontinuation was 5.6% vs. 7.1%. 
Mitigation measures to reduce IRRs should be followed (see section SmPC, 4.2). The incidence and 
severity of infusion related symptoms decreased substantially after the first 1,000 mg was infused, with 
most patients having no IRRs during subsequent administrations of obinutuzumab (see SmPC, section 
4.8). 
As it is expected to be more convenient for patients to retain the possibility of administering the initial 
1000 mg dose of obinutuzumab within one day, section 4.2 of the SmPC under the subheading Dose in 
Cycle 1 on Day 2 allows the 900 mg dose to be administered on Day 2 or Day 1 continued, provided that 
the patient does not experience an IRR during infusion of the first 100 mg. This is considered adequate, 
based on the slow initial infusion rate (25mg/h over 4 hours); the clear recommendation to split the first 
dose over two days in the event that any modification and/or interruption of the infusion is required within 
the infusion of the initial 100mg; the recommendation to increase of the rate of infusion for the 
subsequent 900mg in a stepwise manner; the guidance on how to monitor and treat the patient during 
the first infusion. 
Patients with a high tumour burden (i.e. high peripheral lymphocyte count in CLL [> 25 x 109/L] may be 
at increased risk of severe IRRs. Patients with renal impairment (CrCl < 50 mL/min) and patients with 
both Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) > 6 and CrCl < 70 mL/min are more at risk of IRRs, including 
severe IRRs (see SmPC, section 4.4 and 4.8).  
Cases of cytokine release syndrome have also been reported with Gazyvaro. For information on 
prophylaxis see SmPC, section 4.2.  
If the patient experiences an IRR, the infusion should be managed according to the grade of the reaction. 
For Grade 4 IRRs, the infusion must be stopped and therapy permanently discontinued. For Grade 3 IRRs, 
the infusion must be temporarily interrupted and appropriate medicine administered to treat the 
CHMP assessment report

symptoms. For Grade 1 or 2 IRRs, the infusion must be slowed down and symptoms treated as 
appropriate. Upon resolution of symptoms, the infusion can be restarted, except following Grade 4 IRRs, 
at no more than half the previous rate and, if the patient does not experience the same adverse event 
with the same severity, the infusion rate escalation may resume at the increments and intervals as 
appropriate for the treatment dose. If the previous infusion rate was not well tolerated, instructions for 
the Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 2 infusion rate should be used (see Table 3 in the SmPC, section 4.2).  
Patients must not receive further obinutuzumab infusions if they experience:  
•  Acute life-threatening respiratory symptoms;  
•  A Grade 4 (i.e. life threatening) IRR or;  
•  A  second  occurrence  of  a  Grade  3  (prolonged/recurrent)  IRR  (after  resuming  the  first  infusion  or 
during a subsequent infusion). 
Patients who have pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions should be monitored carefully throughout 
the infusion and the post-infusion period. Hypotension may occur during obinutuzumab intravenous 
infusions. Therefore, withholding of antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours prior 
to and throughout each obinutuzumab infusion and for the first hour after administration. Patients at 
acute risk of hypertensive crisis should be evaluated for the benefits and risks of withholding their 
anti-hypertensive medicine (SmPC, section 4.4). 
From the presented data of Stage 2 of the pivotal study it is evident that obinutuzumab + Clb cause more 
IRRs and more severe IRRs than rituximab + Clb. This is not unexpected due to the formulation of 
obinutuzumab, i.e., reduced levels of core-fucosylations leading to increased ADCC. The incidence of IRRs 
was highest in cycle 1 day 1 and decreased to ≤1% in subsequent cycles.  
The mechanism by which IRRs are triggered is not clearly understood, however, IRRs may be linked to the 
release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators from B-cells targeted by obinutuzumab (Wing et al. 
1996; Winkler et al. 1999; Dillman and Hendrix 2003; Wing 2008). This seems to be a class effect of 
monoclonal antibodies in general and those targeting CD20 in particular. Cases of cytokine release 
syndrome have also been reported with obinutuzumab SmPC, section 4.4). Anaphylactic or 
hypersensitivity reactions to the intravenous administration of protein may also play a part in some 
patients. Overall, in studies BO21000, BO21003 and BO20999, increases in IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α 
occurred mainly during the first infusion of the first cycle of obinutuzumab; subsequent infusions did not 
notably increase the levels of these cytokines. On average, the cytokine levels returned to baseline 
values, suggesting the transient and non-persistent nature of cytokine increases following exposure to 
obinutuzumab (Risk Management Plan). 
Obinutuzumab should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced physician and in an 
environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (SmPC, section 4.2).  
In order to minimise the potential for medication errors, 100 mL and 250 mL infusion bags should be used 
for the 100 mg and 900 mg dose, respectively (SmPC, section 6.6). 
A standard list of MedDRA preferred terms will be used to monitor the identified risk of IRR in the 
applicant’s Global Safety Database as part of the Risk Management Plan.

overwhelm the body’s normal homeostatic mechanisms, causing life threatening metabolic 
derangements and renal failure (Risk Management Plan). 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS) has been reported with obinutuzumab. Patients who are considered to be 
at risk of TLS, e.g. patients with a high tumour burden or a high circulating lymphocyte count (> 25 x 
109/L), should receive adequate tumour lysis prophylaxis with uricostatics (e.g. allopurinol) and 
hydration starting 12-24 hours prior to the infusion of obinutuzumab (see SmPC section 4.2). For 
treatment of TLS, correct electrolyte abnormalities, renal function and fluid balance should be monitored, 
and supportive care administered, including dialysis as indicated (SmPC, section 4.4). TLS has been 
classified as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan.  
Neutropenia, late onset and prolonged neutropenia  
Severe and life-threatening neutropenia including febrile neutropenia has been reported during treatment 
with obinutuzumab (SmPC, section 4.4). Neutropenia in patients with CLL is a known risk with anti-CD20 
therapies and is a complex clinical phenomenon to which several distinct mechanisms may contribute 
(Boxer et al. 2012; Golay et al. 2013). Neutropenia observed during treatment with obinutuzumab may 
be due to the fact that afucosylated IgG1 binds very strongly to neutrophil FcγRIIIb receptors leading to 
their activation and, potentially, to activation-induced neutrophil death. In addition, activated PMNs may 
become re-distributed to the microvasculature of tissues such as the lung (Chopra et al. 2009 [10862]) 
and thereby disappear from the peripheral circulation (Risk Management Plan).  
The mechanism of prolonged neutropenia and late onset neutropenia is not well understood but appears 
to be different from that of early acute neutropenia. Data from on-going phase III clinical trials with 
obinutuzumab in patients with both non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and CLL will provide information to 
further characterise and manage the risk of neutropenia, including prolonged and late onset neutropenia 
(Risk Management Plan).  
Patients who experience neutropenia should be closely monitored with regular laboratory tests until 
resolution. If treatment is necessary it should be administered in accordance with local guidelines and the 
administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors should be considered. Any signs of concomitant 
infection should be treated as appropriate. Dose delays should be considered in case of severe or 
life-threatening neutropenia. Cases of late onset neutropenia (occurring 28 days after the end of 
treatment) or prolonged neutropenia (lasting more than 28 days after treatment has been 
completed/stopped) have also been reported. Patients with renal impairment (CrCl < 50 mL/min) are 
more at risk of neutropenia (SmPC, section 4.4).  
The combination of obinutuzumab with chlorambucil may increase neutropenia (SmPC, section 4.5). 
Neutropenia, late onset and prolonged neutropenia are identified risks in the Risk Management Plan. 
Infections and B-cell depletion  
Obinutuzumab should not be administered in the presence of an active infection and caution should be 
exercised when considering the use of obinutuzumab in patients with a history of recurring or chronic 
infections. Serious bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections can occur during and following 
the completion of obinutuzumab therapy. Fatal infections have been reported (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Patients with both CIRS > 6 and CrCl < 70 mL/min are more at risk of infections, including severe 
infections (SmPC, section 4.4).  
Prolonged B-cell depletion and infections are identified risks in the Risk Management Plan. Although 
obinutuzumab had a potent and prolonged effect on B cell depletion and possibly a minor effect on IgG 
levels during follow up, the adverse events observed in studies BO21004/CLL11, GAO4768g and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 109/123 
 
 
 
 
 
GAO4779g did not suggest any clinically relevant effect. The risk will continue to be analyzed in clinical 
trials (patients are followed for B-cell status for up to 2 years after the last dose of obinutuzumab or until 
a new anti-cancer therapy is initiated, see Risk Management Plan). 
Thrombocytopenia 
Severe and life-threatening thrombocytopenia including acute thrombocytopenia (occurring within 24 
hours after the infusion) has been observed during treatment with obinutuzumab (SmPC, section 4.4). 
The incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher in the obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil arm compared to 
the rituximab plus chlorambucil arm especially during the first cycle. Four (4)% of patients treated with 
obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil experienced acute thrombocytopenia (occurring within 24 hours after 
the obinutuzumab infusion).  
The overall incidence of haemorrhagic events was similar in the obinutuzumab treated arm and in the 
rituximab treated arm in Study BO21004/CLL11. The number of fatal haemorrhagic events was balanced 
between the treatment arms; however, all of the events in patients treated with obinutuzumab were 
reported in Cycle 1.  
Patients with renal impairment (CrCl < 50 mL/min) are more at risk of thrombocytopenia (see section 
4.8). Fatal haemorrhagic events have also been reported in Cycle 1 in patients treated with 
obinutuzumab. A clear relationship between thrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic events has not been 
established.  
Patients should be closely monitored for thrombocytopenia, especially during the first cycle; regular 
laboratory tests should be performed until the event resolves, and dose delays should be considered in 
case of severe or life-threatening thrombocytopenia. Transfusion of blood products (i.e. platelet 
transfusion) according to institutional practice is at the discretion of the treating physician. Use of all 
concomitant therapies which could possibly worsen thrombocytopenia-related events, such as platelet 
inhibitors and anticoagulants, should also be taken into consideration, especially during the first cycle. 
Thrombocytopenia is considered an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. In this context, the 
applicant will monitor the risk of haemorrhagic events including the review of unblinded data from clinical 
trials BO21005, BO21223 and GAO4753g (Risk Management Plan). 
Worsening of pre-existing cardiac conditions 
In patients with underlying cardiac disease, arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation and tachyarrhythmia), 
angina pectoris, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction and heart failure have occurred when 
treated with obinutuzumab. These events may have occurred as part of an IRR and could be fatal.  
In Stage 1a of Study BO21004, a higher incidence of serious cardiac events was found in patients treated 
with obinutuzumab and chlorambucil (18/241 patients; 7%) compared with those treated with 
chlorambucil alone (4/116 patients; 3%). This difference in incidence was partly driven by symptoms of 
IRRs. One of the 18 patients who experienced a serious cardiac event in the GClb arm was actually 
randomized to Clb treatment and inadvertently received one dose of obinutuzumab. The events reported 
in the other 17 patients in the GClb arm included tachycardia (6), cardiac failure and cardiac failure 
congestive (5), MI (3), atrial fibrillation (2), acute coronary syndrome (1), atrial thrombosis (1), cyanosis 
(1) and nodal rhythm (1). Two of the events of MI had a fatal outcome. Seven of the events in the 
obinutuzumab-treated patients occurred on Day 1; these vents were considered related to study 
treatment, which was subsequently discontinued. Among these events, a clinical pattern was observed: 
6 out of 7 events were tachycardia events. The remaining nine events occurred in patients over 70 years 
old with underlying cardiac conditions that predisposed them to such cardiac events (ischemic conditions, 
atrial fibrillation and cardiac failure). In the Clb arm of Study BO21004, 5 patients experienced six events: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 110/123 
 
 
 
 
 
cardiac failure (2), MI (2), angina pectoris (1) and tachyarrhythmia (1). In the Stage 2 data analysis 
(GClb vs. RClb), a comparable incidence of serious cardiac events was observed in the GClb arm (6%) and 
the RClb arm (4%) (Risk Management Plan). Patients with a history of cardiac disease should be 
monitored closely. In addition these patients should be hydrated with caution in order to prevent a 
potential fluid overload (SmPC, section 4.4).  Worsening of pre-existing cardiac conditions is considered 
an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Hepatitis B reactivation  
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and 
death, can occur in patients treated with anti CD20 antibodies including obinutuzumab. At the cut-off date 
of the Risk Management Plan ver. 1.2 (April 2014), two cases of hepatitis B reactivation had been 
reported in clinical trials with obinutuzumab, both from Study BO21005 in DLBCL. These patients were 
found to have raised serum HBV DNA after obinutuzumab therapy, but no clinical manifestations of 
hepatitis. One patient is reported to have received antiviral therapy. HBV DNA was undetectable in both 
patients in subsequent tests. Hepatitis B virus screening should be performed in all patients before 
initiation of treatment with obinutuzumab. At a minimum this should include hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg)- status and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) status. These can be complemented with other 
appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not be treated 
with obinutuzumab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology should consult liver disease experts before 
start of treatment and should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent 
hepatitis reactivation (SmPC, section 4.4). Hepatitis B reactivation is considered an identified risk in the 
Risk Management Plan. 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
PML is caused by reactivation of the DNA JC virus, a human polyomavirus that resides in latent form in 
70-90% of the adult population worldwide. Long-lasting immunosuppression induced by anti-CD20 
antibody treatment, associated chemotherapies and the underlying disease itself are associated with an 
increased risk of reactivation of this virus. PML is a disease that is always serious, and that is fatal or 
severely debilitating in the large majority of patients. There is a potential risk that B-cell depletion may 
have an impact on the incidence and severity of infections. Rituximab has been associated with serious 
viral infections including PML. As obinutuzumab is more potent in terms of B-cell depletion than rituximab, 
there may be an increased risk of infections with obinutuzumab compared to rituximab. One case of PML  
with confirmed presence of JC virus in cerebro-spinal fluid has been reported in Study BO21000 (follicular 
NHL, obinutuzumab in combination with CHOP, FC or bendamustine) (Risk Management Plan). At the time 
of this case, the total exposure to obinutuzumab was over 1200 patients. It is not possible to draw any 
conclusions about the incidence of PML in obinutuzumab treated patients at this time. Progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported in patients treated with obinutuzumab. The 
diagnosis of PML should be considered in any patient presenting with new-onset or changes to 
pre-existing neurologic manifestations. The symptoms of PML are unspecific and can vary depending on 
the affected region of the brain. Motor symptoms with corticospinal tract findings (e.g. muscular 
weakness, paralysis and sensory disturbances), sensory abnormalities, cerebellar symptoms, and visual 
field defects are common. Some signs/symptoms regarded as “cortical” (e.g. aphasia or visual-spatial 
disorientation) may occur. Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a 
neurologist, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture (cerebrospinal fluid testing 
for John Cunningham viral DNA). Therapy with obinutuzumab should be withheld during the investigation 
of potential PML and permanently discontinued in case of confirmed PML. Discontinuation or reduction of 
any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should also be considered. The patient 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 111/123 
 
 
 
 
 
should be referred to a neurologist for the evaluation and treatment of PML (SmPC, section 4.4).PML is an 
identified risk that will be followed through post-marketing surveillance (see Risk Management Plan). 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Transient elevation in liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, AST; alanine aminotransferase, ALT; 
alkaline phosphatase) has been observed shortly after the first infusion of obinutuzumab.  
Special populations 
Elderly: In the pivotal study, 46% (156 out of 336) of patients with CLL treated with obinutuzumab plus 
chlorambucil were 75 years old or older (median age was 74 years). These patients experienced more 
serious  adverse  events  and  adverse  events  leading  to  death  than  those  patients  < 75 years  of  age 
(SmPC, section 4.8).  
Renal  impairment:  In  the  pivotal  study,  27%  (90 out  of 336)  of  patients  with  CLL  treated  with 
obinutuzumab  plus  chlorambucil  had  moderate  renal  impairment  (CrCl  < 50 mL/min).  These  patients 
experienced  more  serious  adverse  events  and  adverse  events  leading  to  death  than  those  with  CrCl 
≥50 mL/min.  
Potential risks 
Impaired immunization response: The safety of immunisation with live or attenuated viral vaccines 
following obinutuzumab therapy has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not 
recommended during treatment and until B cell recovery (SmPC, section 4.4). Due to the potential 
depletion of B cells in newborns following exposure to obinutuzumab during pregnancy, newborns should 
be monitored for B cell depletion and vaccinations with live virus vaccines should be postponed until the 
infant’s B cell count has recovered (see SmPC section 4.4). In case of exposure during pregnancy, 
depletion of B cells may be expected in newborns due to the pharmacological properties of the product. 
Consequently, newborns should be monitored for B cell depletion and vaccinations with live virus vaccines 
should be postponed until the infant’s B cell count has recovered (SmPC, section 4.6). 
Immunogenicity: The incidence and severity of the IRRs were similar in patients who tested positive for 
HAHAs and those that did not. A literature review did not reveal  any relevant publications describing the 
effect of immunogenicity to an anti-CD20 mAB on re-exposure to the same antibody or other anti-CD20 
mAB in patients being treated for hematologic malignancies. Cross-reactivity of HAHA developed for one 
anti-CD20 mAB towards other anti-CD20 mABs is expected to be very low because of distinct sequences 
of CDR regions of different anti-CD20 mABs. So far there is nothing to indicate cross-reactivity even if this 
risk cannot be ruled out. Immunogenicity has been categorized as a potential risk (see Risk Management 
Plan). The Applicant will assess the influence of HAHAs on pharmacokinetics, clinical response, and overall 
safety (including allergic reactions/hypersensitivity events) through analysis of HAHA-positive patients in 
Phase III studies BO21004, BO21005 and BO21223 (Risk Management Plan). 
Secondary malignancies: Secondary malignancies are known to occur with the use immunomodulators 
and it is well known that myelodysplastic cancer/syndrome is associated with the use of chlorambucil. No 
specific pattern regarding other secondary malignancies was evident except for non-melanoma skin 
cancers that occurred in almost all treatment groups. The incidence of second malignancies in the GClb 
arm was lower than reported in the literature for CLL patients; however, the mean observation time in 
Study BO21004 is too short for definitive conclusions to be drawn. However, it is uncertain if 
non-melanoma skin cancers occurred more frequently than what could be expected for this population.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 112/123 
 
 
 
 
 
Second malignancies occurring 6 months after the start of therapy will be considered for monitoring this 
risk in the post-marketing setting. Second malignancy has been categorized as a potential risk (see Risk 
Management Plan).  
Gastrointestinal perforation: No cases of GI perforation have been reported in CLL patients treated with 
obinutuzumab. The incidence of GI perforation events reported from studies with obinutuzumab in NHL 
was 1% or less. A history of GI lymphoma and co-medication with chemotherapy and prednisolone have 
been identified as risk factors for developing GI perforation. The most common causes of perforation in 
cancer patients are spontaneous perforation secondary to tumor (either primary or metastatic), 
iatrogenic perforation secondary to instrumentation (endoscopy) or cancer treatment. Perforation 
secondary to tumor is mainly relevant in NHL patients, as GI tract involvement is much more frequent in 
this patient population than in CLL patients; GI tract involvement is rare in CLL patients. Gastrointestinal 
perforation has been categorized as a potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Immune-mediated glomerulonephritis: Although immune-mediated glomerulonephritis has been 
observed in monkeys, this finding appeared to be species-specific and not relevant in terms of predicting 
the potential immunogenicity of obinutuzumab in humans. Nevertheless, in line with the EMA guideline on 
Good Pharmacovigilance Practices, immune-mediated glomerulonephritis has been categorized as a 
potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Gazyvaro has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. IRRs are very common 
during the first infusion of Gazyvaro, and patients experiencing infusion related symptoms should be 
advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate. (SmPC, section 4.7). 
Overdose 
No experience with overdose is available from human clinical studies. In clinical studies with 
obinutuzumab, doses ranging from 50 mg up to and including 2,000 mg per infusion have been 
administered. The incidence and intensity of adverse reactions reported in these studies did not appear to 
be dose dependent. Patients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption or reduction of 
their infusion and be closely supervised. Consideration should be given to the need for regular monitoring 
of blood cell count and for increased risk of infections while patients are B cell depleted (SmPC, section 
4.9). 
Additional expert consultations 
Not applicable. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of obinutuzumab was in accordance with what would be expected for an anti-CD20 
antibody with infusion-related reactions (IRRs), neutropenia and infections being the most common 
adverse events.

In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should take the following minor points into 
consideration when an update of the Risk management Plan is submitted: 
• 
Part V, Risk Minimisation Measures, does not currently include the section on “Effectiveness of risk 
minimisation measures”. The applicant should ensure that this is incorporated into table V.1, Risk 
minimisation measures by safety concern, at the time of the next RMP update. 
2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Study BO21004 has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of obinutuzumab in terms of the 
primary endpoint PFS, compared to chlorambucil alone, in previously untreated CLL patients with 
coexisting medical conditions and/or renal impairment. At the initial submission, the risk of disease 
progression or death was reduced by 86% when obinutuzumab was given with chlorambucil (HR=0.14, 
95% CI: 0.09, 0.21; log-rank p value = 0.0001).  The updated efficacy results from Stage 1a with longer 
follow-up, now available, support the conclusion drawn from the primary analysis. The Kaplan-Meier 
estimated median duration of PFS was 11.1 months vs. 26.7 months in the Clb arm and GClb arm, 
respectively. The proportion of responders at the end of treatment in the GClb arm was more than double 
that in the Clb arm (77% vs. 31%).  A complete response was reported in 22% of patients in the GClb arm 
versus none in the Clb arm.  Forty-five of 168 GClb patients (27%) assessed for molecular remission 
(blood and bone marrow combined) at the end of treatment were minimal residual disease (MRD) 
negative. The secondary endpoints with mature data, including EFS, overall response rates (Clb: 30.0% 
vs. GClb: 75.5%), CR rates (Clb: 0% vs. GClb: 22.2%), time to new treatment, supported the primary 
efficacy endpoint and favored the GClb arm compared to the Clb arm. 
OS data are still immature. However, there is evidence of a survival benefit for patients in the GClb arm 
compared to the Clb arm with a stratified hazard ratio of 0.41 (95% CI [0.23; 0.74], stratified log-rank 
test p-value 0.0022).  
Meanwhile, stage 2 data where obinutuzumab is directly compared to rituximab (GClb vs RClb), are 
available. The addition of obinutuzumab to Clb resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically 
significant improvement in the primary endpoint of PFS compared to RClb.  Statistically significant 
improvements were observed in all of the secondary efficacy endpoints apart from OS for which the data 
are immature.  In addition, the results were consistent across the pre-specified subgroups for 
investigator-assessed PFS.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
A number of uncertainties were identified during the assessment, including the specific population 
included in the pivotal trial (co-existing medical conditions and / or renal impairment) and the initially 
proposed indication, the posology of Clb and its use in ‘unfit’ patients, the efficacy in the subset of patients 
with CLL with 17p deletion, and the open label design of the pivotal study; all of these uncertainties were 
satisfactorily addressed (see discussion on clinical efficacy). 
One remaining uncertainty is the treatment effect in terms of OS associated with GClb. The OS data are 
still immature although it is possible to exclude a detrimental effect. Additional follow-up will further 
quantify the OS benefit of GClb over Clb and RClb (see discussion on clinical efficacy).  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/231450/2014  
Page 119/123 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety profile of obinutuzumab is not unexpected, with infusion-related reactions (IRRs), neutropenia 
and infections being the most common adverse events including SEAs and Grade 3-5 AEs. However, most 
AEs were manageable.  Obinutuzumab + Chlorambucil (GClb) vs. Chlorambucil (Clb) resulted in more 
adverse events in the GClb treated population but there was almost the same frequency of SAEs in the 
two arms and fewer died due to AE in the GClb arm. Twenty (20)% of patients withdrew from treatment 
due to AE in the GClb. Infusion related reactions (IRRs) were the main contributor to this.  
In Step 2 of the pivotal trial, the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events of 
Grade 3-5, and adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment was higher in the GClb arm 
compared with the RClb arm.  This difference was mainly due to IRRs and a slightly more cases of 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and TLS. More importantly, fewer patients died overall and fewer patients 
had fatal adverse events in the GClb arm compared to the RClb arm. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are currently limited data to assess the influence of HAHAs on safety. Based on the available data, 
however, the incidence and severity of the IRRs were similar in patients who tested positive for HAHAs 
and those that did not. So far there is nothing to indicate cross-reactivity even if this risk cannot be ruled 
out (see discussion on clinical safety). Immunogenicity has been categorised as a potential risk as 
evidence to date is based on laboratory data without any clinical signs of immunogenicity (see Risk 
Management Plan). 
CLL occurs almost exclusively in the adult population, with the median age at diagnosis in the USA being 
72 years, and has an extremely low incidence in children and adolescents (ages 0-18 years). The 
incidence of CLL per 100,000 population in the US is < 0.1 in those aged ≤ 29 years and 0.1-1.8 in those 
aged 30-49 years (Howlader et al. 2013). Thus, data about use of GClb in CLL in children and use in 
pregnancy and lactation are missing. These have been adequately reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.2, 
4.6, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3) and are reflected in the Risk Management Plan. 
The evidence available on the effectiveness of minimising the risk of IRR by dividing the first dose appears 
limited. The Applicant will continue to assess the effectiveness of minimising the risk of IRRs in the 
on-going CLL clinical study M028543 (see Risk Management Plan) 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The clinical efficacy results observed for GClb vs. Clb and RClb are considered of a magnitude that is of 
clear clinical relevance both in absolute (difference in median PFS in the order of one year) and relative 
terms (hazard ratios in the order of .14 to .39 in favour of GClb), in delaying progression of the disease. 
This can be assumed to be delaying worsening of symptoms to a significant extent, and, although data are 
still immature, possible prolonging of OS. Thus, the observed effects are clearly of importance for the 
patients. The toxicity associated with GClb, although expected based on the mechanism of action, was 
also important, including severe, life-threatening or fatal adverse events that occurred more frequently in 
the GClb arm (69%) vs. Clb arm (47%) and were primarily due to IRRs, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia 
and leucopenia.

The safety profile of obinutuzumab included infusion-related reactions (IRRs), neutropenia and infections 
being the most common adverse events. In view of the large effect in terms of PFS, the lack of a detriment 
in OS and possibly an improvement in OS, the coherent evidence from secondary efficacy endpoints, the 
lack of significant uncertainty in terms of efficacy or safety, the toxicity profile is considered acceptable. 
Therefore, the benefit-risk balance for GClb in the proposed indication is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
From a regulatory perspective, a submission with only one pivotal study can be accepted but generally 
requires demonstration of efficacy at levels beyond standard criteria for statistical significance 
(CHMP/EWP/2330/99). The efficacy data submitted for obinutuzumab were clearly statistically and 
clinically convincing, and there was enough corroborating evidence from secondary endpoints and 
non-clinical pharmacodynamic studies to show that the observed results were robust.  
Initially, the benefit-risk balance was uncertain in unfit and frail patients. Indeed, at the time of stage 1 
cut-off, no direct comparison between GClb and RClb (the standard treatment for unfit patients) was 
available in terms of efficacy or safety. Similarly, Clb alone was considered an acceptable comparator only 
in the frailest patients of the pivotal study and the benefit of GClb in a larger set of frail patients was 
uncertain. Following submission of high-level results from Stage 2 showing a strongly positive effect of 
GClb against RCbl without major differences in toxicity, and acknowledging that Clb alone was an 
acceptable comparator at the time the studies were conducted, these uncertainties have been 
satisfactorily addressed.  
There have been major advances in the treatment of CLL over the past decade with the introduction of 
rituximab, ofatumumab, alemtuzumab, purine analogs, bendamustine and combined 
chemoimmunotherapy with regimens such as FCR. However, the disease remains incurable and a 
significant number of patients die of CLL every year. Recently, there have been an increasing number of 
new compounds in clinical development, including new anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as 
obinutuzumab, agents targeting BCR signalling (e.g., idelalisib, ibrutinib), etc. Given the high number of 
new agents, the challenge will be to identify and clinically validate the best combinations and sequences 
of treatments to achieve the long-term control of CLL with optimal quality of life (Hallek 2013).  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Gazyvaro is not similar to Arzerra within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Derogation of market exclusivity 
Not applicable.

Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Gazyvaro, in combination with chlorambucil for the treatment of adult patients 
with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and with comorbidities making them 
unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine based therapy (see section 5.1.), is favourable and therefore 
recommends  the granting of the  marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
• 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 8 months following authorisation. Subsequently, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit 
periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of 
Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the

• 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required  pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same 
time. 
Additional risk minimisation measures   
• 
Not applicable. 
• 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures  
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

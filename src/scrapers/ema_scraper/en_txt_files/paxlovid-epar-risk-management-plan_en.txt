Brief description of the product: 
Chemical class 
Antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors 
Summary of mode of action 
Nirmatrelvir is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the coronavirus 
SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), also referred to as 3C-like 
protease (3CLpro) or nsp5 protease. Inhibition of the SARS-
CoV-2 Mpro renders the protein incapable of processing 
polyprotein precursors which leads to the prevention of viral 
replication. Nirmatrelvir was shown to be a potent inhibitor of 
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Ki=0.00311 μM, or IC50=0.0192 µM) in a 
biochemical enzymatic assay.  
Nirmatrelvir had a median EC50 value of 83 nM (range: 39-146 
nM) against the Omicron sub-variants, reflecting EC50 value 
fold-changes ≤1.5 relative to the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. 
In addition, the antiviral activity of nirmatrelvir against the 
SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Mu, and 
Omicron BA.1 variants was assessed in Vero E6 P-gp knockout 
cells. Nirmatrelvir had a median EC50 value of 25 nM (range: 
16-141 nM). The Beta variant was the least susceptible variant 
tested with an EC50 value fold-change of 3.7 relative to the 
USA-WA1/2020. The other variants had EC50 value fold-
changes ≤1.1 relative to USA-WA1/2020. 
Ritonavir is not active against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Ritonavir 
inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir, 
thereby providing increased plasma concentrations of 
nirmatrelvir.

PART II. SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Module SI. Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population (s) 
Indication: 
Treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults who do not require 
supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk for progressing to severe COVID-19. 
Incidence:  
The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus labelled as 
SARS-CoV-2.  The disease first emerged in December 2019, when a cluster of patients with 
pneumonia of unknown cause was recognised in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.1  The 
number of infected cases rapidly increased and spread beyond China throughout the world.   
On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern and thus a pandemic.2 
Estimates of SARS-CoV-2 incidence change rapidly.  The MAA obtained incidence and 
prevalence estimates using data from Worldometer, a trusted independent organisation that 
collects COVID-19 data from official reports and publishes current global and 
country-specific statistics online.3 
As of 03 January 2023, the overall number of people who had been infected with 
SARS-CoV-2 was over 665 million worldwide.4   
Table 1 shows the incidence and prevalence as of 03 January 2023 for the US, UK, and EU-
27 countries.  In the EU and the UK, by 03 January 2023 the total number of confirmed cases 
had accumulated over 204 million people, or 39,879 per 100,000 people.  Across countries in 
the EU, the number of confirmed cases ranged from 16,877 to 63,005 cases per 100,000 
people.  Poland and Romania reported the lowest incidence rates while France, Slovenia, and 
Austria reported the highest.4 
In the US, the number of confirmed cases had reached over 102 million cases (30,671 per 
100,000 people) by 03 January 2023.4

The reported numbers refer to cases that have been tested and confirmed to be carrying the 
virus and sometimes, depending upon the country, also presumptive, suspect, or probable 
cases of detected infection.  There are large geographic variations in the proportion of the 
population tested as well as in the quality of reporting across countries.  People who carry the 
virus but remain asymptomatic are less likely to be tested and therefore mild cases are likely 
underreported.5 Further, as at-home rapid testing kits have become more readily available6 
and formal testing resources reach capacity due to the Omicron variant, the true estimate of 
cases is estimated to be larger than formally reported counts.   The numbers should therefore 
be interpreted with caution.7  The variants from all SARS-CoV-2 specimens sequenced by the 
CDC during the week ending 31 December 2022 can be found in Figure 1 below, along with 
the variant proportions identified from the week ending 01 October through the week ending 
31 December 2022.7 Figure 2 shows the variant proportions of all EU countries from Weeks 
38-49 20228.

Prevalence: 
The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is defined as active cases per 100,000 people 
including confirmed cases in people who have not recovered or died.  On 03 January 2023, 
the overall prevalence estimates for the EU and UK were 669 and 119 active cases per 
100,000, respectively.4   The range of reported prevalence for EU-27 was 0 to 6,398 per 
100,000: Greece, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic reported the lowest prevalence while 
Luxembourg, Poland, and Estonia reported the highest (Table 1). It should be noted that 
Greece reported 0 active cases on 03 January 2023, leading to a prevalence estimate of 0 per 
100,000 population. 
In the US, the prevalence on 03 January 2023 was 584 active cases per 100,000.4   
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication and risk factors for the 
disease:  
Since the beginning of the pandemic, the ECDC has collected COVID-19 information from 
all countries who are members of the EU/EEA.  In the ECDC’s TESSy database COVID-19 
case-based data, including age and gender are available for over 80% of the official number 
of cases reported by ECDC epidemic intelligence,9 enabling estimates of age and gender 
distribution representative of the European population.  The ECDC website posted a notice 
that the 04 November 2021 edition of the COVID-19 surveillance report would be the last 
and that it would not be updated in that form in the future.  Henceforth, surveillance data 
would be reported in a weekly “Country Overview Report” that provides less age-based 
information and no gender-based information.  Relevant age- and gender-based data from the 
final edition of the more comprehensive COVID-19 surveillance report on 04 November 
2021, as well as available age-based data from the most recent edition (23 December 2021)

COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) performs 
population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-associated 
hospitalizations in the US. Cases are identified by reviewing hospital, laboratory, and 
admission database and infection control logs for patients who are hospitalized and have 
documented positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Based on data from COVID-NET, COVID-19 
associated US hospitalizations, by age, for the period 07 March 2020 through 10 December 
2022 are shown in Figure 4.12

Figure 5.  COVID-19-Associated US Hospital Admissions by Sex, March 2020 – 
August 2022 
Published studies have provided demographics of patients affected by COVID-19. In a study 
that analyzed data from 1,164 symptomatic, molecularly confirmed hospitalized (admitted 
between 05 May 2020 and 19 March 2021) adult COVID-19 patients from 20 different 
hospitals across the US, the median age was 59.0 years (intra-quartile range 20 years) and 
61% of the patients were male.  The racial/ethnic distribution of the patients was 48% white, 
22% black, 5% Asian, 31% Hispanic and 65% non-hispanic.14    
An observational, retrospective study examined 1,436 patients ≥18 year-old with confirmed 
COVID-19 presenting to the Emergency Departments of 10 hospitals in the United Kingdom, 
Italy, Spain and Switzerland, predominantly during the first wave of the pandemic.  Those 
who were not admitted to hospital were a mean age of 51.6 (+/- 12.8) years old and 51.9% of 
them were male.  Those admitted to hospital were analyzed separately according to whether 
they survived or not.  The mean ages of those admitted were 62.5 (+/- 15.3) years and 62.6% 
were males for those who survived. For those who did not survive, mean age was 71.3 (+/-
12) years and 70.6% were male.15 
Another study used data from the Primary Care Sentinel Cohort of the Oxford Royal College 
of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre database, which is considered to 
be nationally representative of the English population, to identify COVID-19 cases from 01 
March 2020 to 01 April 2021.  Overall, the investigators identified 395,680 persons with 
COVID-19 among the 7,382,775 persons registered in the database. The mean (SD) age of 
those infected was 44.56 (21.75) years; 55.6% of them were female; the racial distribution 
was 65.1% white, 2.8% black, 8.7% Asian, 2.3% other and 21.1% unknown; and 57% of 
them were from the “most deprived” socio-economic category.16

An analysis of US data from 2020 showed that disease has been much less severe among 
ages 0-24 years compared to ages ≥25 years, with 2.5% hospitalised, 0.8% admitted to an 
intensive care unit, and <0.1% dying among ages 0-24, versus 16.6% hospitalised, 8.6% 
intensive care, and 5% dying among ages ≥25 years.17  Early in the pandemic, approximately 
90% of hospitalised cases were over 40 years old and the majority had been male, although 
currently there is an approximately equal distribution in sex.18-22    
African American COVID-19 patients have been reported to have an increased risk of 
hospitalisation,19,23 and mortality,24 compared to white patients in the United States.  A CDC 
report examined demographic trends among US COVID-19 deaths from May to August of 
2020.25  During the observation period, the percentage of US COVID-19 deaths that were 
Hispanic increased from 16.3% in May to 26.4% in August, the only racial or ethnic group 
among whom the percentage of deaths increased during that time.   
An earlier CDC report on excess deaths covering 26 January 2020 through 03 October 2020 
broke down excess deaths by demographics.26 By age during that period, the largest increase 
in deaths compared to average expected deaths occurred among adults aged 25-44 (26.5% 
increase) while deaths among people <25 years was 2.0% below average during this period.  
By race, increases in deaths compared to expectation were largest among Hispanics (53.6% 
increase), Asian Americans (36.6% increase), African Americans (32.9% increase). 
In a 2021 report, the CDC data on Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19 reported that 
deaths in age groups 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75-84, and ≥85 years exceeded historical numbers 
from 2015-2019.27  
While research earlier in the pandemic tended to focus on adults, more recent data have given 
greater attention to children and adolescents.  For the period January 1-March 31 2021 across 
14 states (the most recently available data), the CDC’s Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-
19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) database recorded 204 
adolescents aged 12-17 who were hospitalized for likely primarily COVID-19-related 
reasons.28  The 204 adolescents were 47.5% male—consistent with the COVID case sex 
distribution across all ages—and disproportionately from minorities, with 31.4% Hispanic 
and 35.8% non-Hispanic African Americans.28 For the period 07 March 2020 –24 
December 2022, the CDC’s COVID-NET database recorded that 6,434 children aged 0-4 had 
a positive COVID test proximal to hospitalization and 6,239 children aged 5-17 had a 
positive COVID test proximal to hospitalization.29 
Another CDC report described demographic trends in US COVID-19 incidence among 
15,068 cases aged 0-24 years across 16 jurisdictions during the period 01 January 2020 
through 31 December 2020.30  The report broke down incidence by age groups and 2020 sub-
periods that are presented in Table 4.  The table shows that early in 2020, 5-9 year olds were 
experiencing less COVID-19 than 0-4 year olds, but by the end of the year this pattern had 
reversed.  Compared to 5-9 year olds, the age categories 10-14, 15-19, and 20-24 years old 
showed progressively greater incidence rates, a pattern that held throughout 2020.

summarizes demographic results for a retrospective cohort of 135,794 individuals under the 
age of 25 who were tested for COVID-19 by 08 September 2020 within the PEDSnet 
network of US paediatric health systems.31 The table shows that, among the paediatric 
population, children age 12-17 were more frequently infected than those under age 12.  
African Americans and Hispanics had elevated frequencies of testing positive relative to their 
proportion of the cohort.

A study of 1,945,831 individuals aged 0-18 recorded in the Premier Healthcare Database 
between March and October 2020 included 20,714 paediatric cases of COVID-19; the 
authors reported similar patterns to what is shown in Table 5 with the additional observation 
that COVID-19 cases aged 0-1 and 12-18 years were more likely to develop serious illness 
than those aged 2-11.32 
A retrospective study of public health surveillance data in Denver, Colorado identified 9,815 
children and adolescents who had COVID-19 from 1 March 2020, through 30 September 
2021. The age distribution of those infected was as follows: <1 yr 4.9%, 1-4 yrs 16.3%, 5-10 
yrs 29.6%, 11-13 yrs 18.4%, and 14-17 yrs 30.8%. The cases were 50% male and 50% 
female.  The racial/ethnic distribution was Hispanic / Latino 57.3%, non-Hispanic White 
29.0%, non-Hispanic Black 7.1%, and non-Hispanic other 6.5% from a base population that 
was Hispanic / Latino 46.2%, non-Hispanic White 36.9%, non-Hispanic Black 12.0%, and 
non-Hispanic other 4.9%.33 
Risk Factors 
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily through respiratory 
droplets and direct contact.34 Thus the risk of initial infection increases through spending 
time in close physical proximity to others, especially in indoor spaces with poor ventilation.35  
People living in long-term care facilities or high-density apartment homes, or working in 
occupations with close proximity to others (eg, healthcare, transportation), have a higher risk 
of infection.35,36 Among children, the primary source of infection is an infected adult living in 
the same household,37 but age is not associated with risk of initial infection among people 
aged 5 and older based on current data from the CDC (Table 6).38  
According to the CDC, some ethnic minority groups have a higher risk of infection 
(Table 6).39  Male sex is also a significant risk factor for severe disease and mortality due to 
COVID-19.40  In addition, there is evidence that high-risk human leukocyte antigen 
haplotypes, higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphisms, and several 
genes of cellular proteases increase the risk of susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.41,42  
Lastly, recent narrative reviews and meta-analyses indicate that Blood type O is associated 
with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection; whereas type A is frequently described as a risk 
factor and is most often associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality.43,44

Risk for severe or fatal COVID-19 disease has been shown to increase with older age, male 
sex, or ethnic minority status.27,38-41,45-51 Among adults, these risks increase for every 10-year 
age group above age 39 (Table 6).27,38,39,45-49,52  Table 6 also gives estimated rate ratios for 
COVID-19 hospitalisation and death by race/ethnicity relative to white, non-Hispanic 
persons in the US.  Based on regularly updated data from the CDC, the highest risks of 
hospitalisation and death occurred in those who were American Indian or Alaska native

persons (RR = 2.5 for hospitalisation and 2.1 for death), when compared to those who were 
non-Hispanic white.  These differences in risk among ethnic groups may be attributed to 
differences in underlying factors that are correlated with race/ethnicity including 
socioeconomic status, access to health care, and occupation-related virus exposure.53 
Children aged 5-17 typically experience a milder disease course and have lower risk of 
hospitalization or death.  Further, among a cohort of children hospitalized with COVID-19 in 
the United States from March 2020 to May 2021, children 6 months – 4 years of age had a 
similar risk of severe disease as children ages 12 – 17 years.54 
Risk of severe or fatal COVID-19 disease is higher among persons who are current or former 
smokers, have lower socioeconomic status, have no or public insurance, or live in 
neighbourhoods with higher rates of limited English proficiency.27,45,52,34,50,55,56 The CDC has 
also recognised other socio-demographic groups who may need to take extra precautions 
against COVID-19 due to increased risk for severe illness: pregnant women; breastfeeding 
mothers; people with disabilities or those who are clinically frail; people with developmental, 
behavioural, or substance abuse disorders and newly resettled refugee populations.57 
Among adults, risk for severe or fatal COVID-19 disease increases with the presence of 
chronic medical conditions, including obesity, chronic lung diseases (eg, COPD or asthma), 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, liver disease, neurological diseases (eg, stroke or 
dementia), chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, immunosuppression, HIV, higher 
scores on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale and Charlson Comorbidity Index.27,45,46,50,52,58-
72  Table 7 shows the estimated hazard ratios of COVID-19 mortality associated with these 
chronic conditions and socio-demographics from a cohort study of 17 million adults (with 
17,000 COVID-19-related deaths) in England.52

Risk Management Plan 
19 April 2023 
A recent prospective observational study sought to better understand the association between 
characteristics of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the US and the risk of clinical 
outcomes and post-acute clinical sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC).14  A total of 1,164 patients 
symptomatic patients admitted to 20 hospitals (affiliated with 15 academic institutions) 
across the US were enrolled.  Admission-specific data elements were acquired via review of 
electronic medical records at 5 separate time-points over a 28-day period. The patients’ 
disease severity was assessed at each time-point using a 7-point ordinal scale (ranging from 
not hospitalized/no limitations to death) based on World Health Organization and US 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease severity scales.  Data lock on the survey 
data was performed on 07 April 2022.  The median age was 59 years (interquartile range 20); 
711 (61%) were men; the overall mortality was 14%, and 228 (20%) of the patients required 
invasive mechanical ventilation.  The authors report that risk factors associated with 
prolonged hospitalization or death by day 28 included age ≥65 years, Hispanic ethnicity, 
elevated baseline creatinine or troponin, baseline lymphopenia, presence of infiltrate by chest 
imaging, and high SARS-CoV2 viral load.  Survivors
were prospectively surveyed for 1 year 
after discharge through quarterly surveys.  Of these 589 completed at least one survey at 
follow-up.  Three hundred five (52%) of those completing at least one survey had at least one 
symptom consistent with PASC, most commonly dyspnea. Female sex was the only 
associated risk factor for PASC.14 
Another recent study by Tsai et al was conducted with the aim to estimate the global risk and 
risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome among patients with COVID-
19.  The authors performed a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of 
published studies from of patients in hospitals or nursing homes with ARDS after COVID-
19. Study inclusion criteria were: (1) the study provided primary data on the prevalence of 
ARDS using validated assessment tools or coded medical report data within a population-
based study after COVID-19 occurred; (2) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19; and (3) 
the studies were observational, such as cohort and cross-sectional studies, and were published 
from 2019 to 2022. A total of 12 studies, conducted in 7 countries (including the US, China, 
Korea, India, Germany, Poland and Greece) were included. Six studies were retrospective, 
three were cross-sectional, two were cohort studies, and one was a prospective study. All 12 
studies were conducted with hospitalized patients. A total of 148,080 patients (50.8% male) 
were studied. The prevalence of ARDS among the studies ranged from 3.6% to 76.4%; the 
overall pooled risk was 23% (95% CI 14.3–34.7%) with significant heterogeneity within the 
12 studies.  Based on the meta-analysis results, significant heterogeneity was identified 
among the studies for the risk of ARDS.  Therefore, a meta-regression analysis was 
conducted to identify factors affecting heterogeneity through the subgroups.  Meta-regression 
revealed that statistically significant risk factors for ARDS included: age ≥41 to 64 years, 
fever, multi-lobe involvement on chest X-ray, lymphopenia, mechanical ventilation with 
oxygen therapy, European region, and study sample size less than or equal to 500 patients.73 
The presence of one or more underlying medical conditions also increases risk of severe or 
fatal disease among children aged 5-17.74-77 In particular, childhood obesity has been 
consistently associated with two to three times the risk of severe disease or 
hospitalisation74,77-79 and among hospitalised children with COVID-19 diabetes has been 
shown to increase the risk of death two-fold compared with those without diabetes.80 In 
addition, Children and adolescents with obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiencies,

malignancies, chronic respiratory diseases (cystic fibrosis, severe asthma etc.), and other 
chronic diseases are more susceptible to developing severe disease.81  For many other 
individual comorbid conditions, pediatric sample sizes are very small and different studies 
produce conflicting results, so it is difficult to estimate precise risk ratios based on current 
literature.37,75  
The main existing treatment options:  
EMA has authorised remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and paediatric 
patients (at least 4 weeks of age and weighing at least 3 kg) with pneumonia requiring 
supplemental oxygen and in adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg) who do 
not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe 
COVID-19.  
Tocilizumab received an authorization for the treatment of adults with COVID-19 who are 
receiving systemic treatment with corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen or 
mechanical ventilation.  
In November 2021, Ronapreve (casirivimab/imdevimab) received EMA authorisation for 
treating COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 
kilograms) who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of their 
disease becoming severe. The medicine can also be used to prevent COVID-19 in people 
aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kilograms. Ronapreve contains two active 
substances, casirivimab and imdevimab. 
The monoclonal antibody sotrovimab and regdanvimab and the combined 
tixagevimab/cilgavimab have been also authorised in EU for treating COVID-19 in patients 
who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of the disease 
becoming severe.  
On 16 December 2021, CHMP issued advice on the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the 
treatment of COVID-19; on 28 January 2022, CMA was granted in EU and then switched to 
a full marketing authorisation on 24 February 2023.

fatal.82-85 The most common symptoms for symptomatic infected persons are fever, dry 
cough, and fatigue; upper respiratory tract symptoms can include pharyngalgia, headaches, 
and myalgia.34  Current data indicate that about 80% of COVID-19 patients are 
asymptomatic or have mild-to-moderate symptoms, while about 15% develop more severe 
disease requiring hospitalisation and about 5% require ventilation  support.34 In addition, 10–
20% of COVID-19-infected persons experience persistent or new symptoms for periods of 
weeks to years.34 
The rate of asymptomatic infection decreases with increasing age and long-term care 
facilities are associated with a lower rate of asymptomatic infection when compared to

household transmission or other healthcare facilities.85 The most common symptoms of 
COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath for both children and adults 
(Table 8).86,87 However, it has been noted that in older people, COVID-19 clinical 
presentation is extremely heterogeneous and atypical signs and symptoms such as 
hyporexia/apyrexia, confusion, delirium, and pre-syncope / syncope are more common than 
in middle-aged and younger persons.88 
A recent meta-analysis has estimated that 46.7% of infections in children are asymptomatic85, 
while a recent systematic review that examined 1,140 cases of COVID-19 in children from 
23 published studies found that 11% of cases were asymptomatic. Among symptoms, fever 
was reported in 48%, cough 37%, any nasopharyngeal symptom 22%.89  In a more recent 
meta-analysis of 32 studies that provided information about COVID-19 infection in pediatric 
patients the proportions with specific symptoms were as follows: fever 33%, cough 25%, 
rhinorrhea 13%, fatigue 9%, dyspnea 9%, diarrhea 6%, headache 9%, sore throat 7% and 
vomiting 7%.90

Progression and Timeline of Mild to Moderate Disease 
Mild to moderate disease is defined as the absence of viral pneumonia and hypoxia. For those 
who develop symptoms, the incubation period is usually 4 to 5 days, with 97.5% 
experiencing symptoms within 11 days of exposure.91,92 Those with mild COVID-19 recover 
at home with supportive care and guidance to self-isolate.  Those with moderate disease are 
monitored at home and are sometimes recommended to be hospitalised if conditions worsen 
92  Data on rates of re-infection are limited but variants that are not neutralized by immune 
antisera, such as the South African beta, delta, and omicron variants, may lead to increased 
risk of re-infection in the future.91,93

Progression and Timeline of Severe Disease Requiring Hospitalisation 
Those with severe disease will require hospitalisation to manage their illness. Based on data 
that have been systematically collected for the US by the CDC between 01 August 2020 and 
02 January 2023, there were 5,797,928 new hospital admissions for patients with confirmed 
COVID-19 in the US.94  For the 50th week of 2022, 7.6 patients per 100,000 population 
(country range: 1.3-19.5) were hospitalised due to COVID-19 in 14 countries of the EU/EEA 
with available data.95
175,603 total hospital admissions for patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the US for those 
0-17 years of age.94  
  Between 01 August 2020 and 02 January 2023, the CDC reports 
Studies early in the pandemic demonstrated that time from onset of illness to ARDS was 
8-12 days and time from onset of illness to ICU admission was 9.5–12 days.91  In 9 countries 
of the EU/EEA with available data, 0.5 patients per 100,000 population (country range 0.1-1-
3) were in the ICU due to COVID-19 for the week 49 2022.95 A recent meta-analysis found 
that, of patients <19 years of age, 11% went to the ICU, non-invasive ventilation was 
administered among 12%, and 4% required mechanical ventilation.83 A study of 82 cases in 
three pediatric hospitals noted that older children and those with higher body mass index or 
multiple comorbidities were more likely to receive respiratory support.96 
A large number of patient characteristics (demographic / personal, comorbid conditions, 
complications of COVID) have been identified as being risk factors of severe COVID or 
death from COVID (Table 9):

Mortality 
Mortality data are presented from Worldometer, an independent organisation that publishes 
current, reliable COVID-19 statistics online.3  The mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 
defined as the cumulative number of deaths among detected cases.  
As of 03 January 2023, the overall SARS-CoV-2 mortality for the EU27 + UK was 
1,390,809 deaths, or 271 per 100,000 people.  Reported mortality among EU countries and 
the UK ranged from 103 to 557 deaths per 100,000 (Table 2). Cyprus and Netherlands 
reported the lowest mortality; Croatia, Hungary, and Bulgaria reported the highest.4  
In the US, as of 03 January 2023, the mortality was 1,118,484 deaths (334 per 100,000 
people).  Mortality in the US was higher than that of the UK (290 per 100,000).4 
Overall reported mortality among hospitalised COVID-19 patients varies from 12.8% to 26% 
in the EU, UK, and US.23,25,105,106 Mortality rates are declining over time, presumably due to 
an improved understanding of COVID-19 and its management.107  
Work has been done to try and predict mortality using data from patients hospitalized with 
COVID-19. Two recent publications describe efforts to develop models to predict mortality. 
The first, by Vagliano et al, described and validated a predictive model, using data from 
electronic health records, for in-hospital mortality of 972 COVID-19 patients admitted 
between 15 February 2020 and 01 January 2021 to the intensive care units of 19 hospitals 
during two different waves of the pandemic. In total 322 patients (33.1 %) died during their 
hospital stay. Survivors were significantly younger (61.0 vs 68.2 years) and were less often 
males (69.8 % vs 77.6 %) than non-survivors.  The strongest risk factors for mortality in the 
final model were older age, higher average fraction of inspired oxygen in the first 24 hours of 
admission, and higher maximum glucose in the first 24 hours of admission. A lower 
estimated glomerular filtration rate in first 24 hours of admission and higher neutrophil count 
in the first 24 hours of admission were other important risk factors for death.108   
The second, by Sozio et al, was an observational, retrospective study that examined patients 
≥18 years old with confirmed (by real-time reverse-transcription PCR) (COVID-19 
presenting to the Emergency Departments of 10 hospitals in the United Kingdom, Italy, 
Spain and Switzerland, predominantly during the first wave of the pandemic.  The individual 
probability of being discharged directly from ED or of being admitted to hospital, with or 
without risk of mortality due to COVID-19, was estimated with several different 
implementations of machine learning models based on multiclass random forest classifiers.

Analysis of Variance testing was performed according to admission and outcome status (not 
admitted, admitted and survived, admitted and died).  Those patients who were admitted and 
died were older, more likely male, had higher serum creatinine levels, had lower platelet 
counts, had higher levels of mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM; an 
inflammatory biomarker that improves the prognostic assessment of patients with sepsis, 
septic shock and organ failure), higher white blood cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts, 
higher LDH, Procalcitonin, CRP and D-dimer levels, and more often had comorbidities 
including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, 
hypertension, and malignancy.  The most important predictors of admission and death were 
in order of strength: MR-proADM, age, LDH level CRP level, WBC count and platelet 
count. The authors presented a decision tree to facilitate interpretation of the most important 
interactions captured by the random forest classifier, in which age represents the predominant 
risk factor in determining the need for hospitalization, which is further enhanced by the 
patient’s levels of MR-proADM and CRP.15 
Complications of COVID-19 and Long-COVID 
Complications of COVID-19 include impaired function of the heart/cardiovascular system109-
112, brain/neurological system113,114, lung, gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary system115, 
kidney116,117, metabolic / endocrine systems118, and coagulation system119,120.18,21,121  
Complications affecting the heart / cardiovascular system that have been observed include 
acute myocardial injury, acute coronary syndromes, venous and arterial thrombosis, 
cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, myocarditis, pericarditis, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, 
and right ventricular dysfunction.109,110.  One recent review reports that the proportions of 
patients experiencing some of these complications are as follows: cardiac dysrhythmias in 17 
to 44%, cardiac injury with increases in blood troponin in 22 to 40%, myocarditis in 2 to 7%, 
heart failure in 4 to 21%, and thromboembolic events in 15 to 39%.111  Another recent review 
indicates that injury to the myocardium has been reported in up to 30% of hospitalized 
COVID-19 patients and up to 55% in those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.112  In 
addition, it has been reported that long-term follow-up of Covid-19 patients has revealed 
increased incidence of arrhythmia, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, right ventricular 
dysfunction, and myocardial fibrosis.110  
Neurologic complications of COVID-19 infection have also been extensively studied.   
Dimitriadis et al examined neurologic manifestations in critically ill COVID-19 patients in a 
prospective, multicenter, observational registry study of such patients admitted to 19 German 
ICUs between April 2020 and September 2021. During the study period, among the 15 ICUs 
that reported a total of 2681 admissions, 340 patients (12.7%) developed neurologic 
manifestations, the most common being encephalopathy (including delirium, disorder of 
consciousness, hypoxic encephalopathy, encephalopathy not further described), 
cerebrovascular disorders (including ischemic stroke, intra-cerebral hemorrhage, 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, reversible cerebral 
vasoconstriction syndrome, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cerebral microbleeds, subdural 
hematoma) and neuromuscular disorders (including polyneuropathy or myopathy, Guillain–
Barré syndrome, myasthenia, myositis).113  A meta-analysis on the incidence of seizures 
among COVID-19 patients by Hussaini et al included a total of 11,526 patients from 21 
published articles. A total of 255 (2.2%; 95% CI 0.05-0.24, p < 0.01) patients presented with 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
Risk Management Plan 
19 April 2023 
seizures as the first manifestation of COVID-19.  Only 71 of the 255 patients had previously 
been diagnosed with epilepsy.114  
There are also psychological complications of COVID-19 infection.  Khraisat et al conducted 
a meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of mental disorders among COVID-19 
survivors.  The analysis included 27 studies with a total sample size of 9605 Covid-19 
survivors. The prevalence rates (95% CI) for psychological complications were as follows: 
overall psychological distress 36% (22–51%), post-traumatic stress disorder 20% (16–24%), 
anxiety 22% (18–27%), psychological distress 36% (22–51%), depression 21% (16–28%), 
and sleeping disorders 35% (29–41%).122  Also, a recent narrative review of the literature on 
postacute neurologic sequelae of COVID-19 indicates that commonly conditions include 
persistent fatigue, headaches, “brain fog”, depression, and anxiety.123 
Shih et al report that patients with COVID-19 can have GI and hepatobiliary manifestations, 
which are often mild and transient, although they can occasionally be severe. The most 
common consequential GI manifestation is ischemic enterocolitis.  Abnormal liver 
chemistries occur in 14-53% of Covid-19 patients, both at admission and during 
hospitalization. Typically, liver function test elevations are mild and that recover without 
specific treatment.  Rarely patients with COVID-19 may present with acute liver failure,  
develop primary liver disease during their illness, or develop post- COVID-19 
cholangiopathy (a form of secondary sclerosing cholangitis).115    
Mallhi et al performed a review of 42 published systematic reviews on CAKI.  They found 
that the incidence of CAKI ranged from 4.3% to 36.4% overall among COVID-19 patients, 
36%–50% in KTRs, and up to 53% in patients with severe or critical illness.116  Matsumoto 
and Prowle (2022), in their review of the literature on CAKI report that large observational 
studies and meta-analyses report an AKI incidence of 28--34% in all inpatients and 46--77% 
in patients admitted to the ICU. The majority of survivors recovered their kidney function by 
hospital discharge; however, they remained at increased risk of future AKI, a decline in 
estimated eGFR, and chronic kidney disease. Moreover, even in the absence of overt AKI a 
significant proportion of survivors of COVID-19 hospitalisation had reduced eGFR on 
follow-up.117  
The risk of new onset diabetes mellitus was reported to be 66% (95% CI 1.38; 2.00) higher 
among survivors of COVID-19 compared with controls in a meta-analysis of eight studies 
consisting of 4,270,747 COVID-19 patients and 43,203,759 controls.118 
Other complications of COVID-19 include hemolytic anemia124, endocrine disorders 
(including the thyroid, pancreas, adrenal, neuroendocrine, gonadal, and parathyroid 
glands)125,126, musculoskeletal disorders including persisting or new-onset fatigue, myalgia, 
arthralgia, arthritis, muscle weakness127, opportunistic infections72, and adverse pregnancy 
outcomes including preterm labor and cesarean delivery without any intrauterine infection, 
and severe neonatal asphyxia.128 
A recent narrative review of coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 infection indicates 
thrombosis occurs as a result of the virus invading endothelial cells causing local 
complement activation and inflammation which leads to microvascular thrombi (both venous 
and arterial), which may eventually lead to widespread macrovascular thrombotic injury and 
in some cases end-organ failure.120

Based on a meta-analysis of 42 studies, the risk of thromboembolism was 21% overall and 
31% in the ICU, with the pooled odds of mortality being 74% higher among those who 
experienced thromboembolism compared to those who did not.129  
Complications of Long-Covid 
COVID-19 symptoms can persist weeks or months beyond the acute infection.130,131 The 
NICE guideline scope published on 30 October 2020 defined “Long COVID” signs and 
symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID‑19.  It includes both ongoing 
symptomatic COVID‑19 (from 4 to 12 weeks) and post‑COVID‑19 syndrome (12 weeks or 
more and for which signs and symptoms are not explained by an alternative diagnosis).132 
A meta-analysis of 31 studies published until 17 September 2020 prior to the emergence of 
the omicron variant among patients between 18 to 49 years of age found that COVID-19 
symptoms were experienced for 14 days to 3 months post-infection, including persistent 
fatigue (39–73%), breathlessness (39–74%), decrease in quality of life (44–69%), impaired 
pulmonary function, abnormal CT findings including pulmonary fibrosis (39–83%), evidence 
of peri-/perimyo-/myocarditis (3–26%), changes in microstructural and functional brain 
integrity with persistent neurological symptoms (55%), increased incidence of psychiatric 
diagnoses (5.8% versus 2.5–3.4% in controls), and incomplete recovery of olfactory and 
gustatory dysfunction (33–36%).133  
Yang et al conducted a meta-analysis of 72 studies with a total of 88,769 patients to examine 
the occurrence of different symptoms up to one year of follow-up for previously hospitalised 
patients with COVID-19. A total of 167 sequelae related to COVID-19 were identified, the 
more common ones being fatigue 27.5%, somnipathy 20.1%, anxiety 18.0%, dyspnea 15.5%, 
PTSD 14.6%, hypomnesia 13.4%, arthralgia 12.9%, depression 12.7%, alopecia 11.2%. The 
prevalence of most symptoms declined after > 9 months of follow-up, but fatigue and 
somnipathy persisted in 26.2% and 15.1% of patients, respectively.134  
The incidence of Long COVID is progressively greater among non-hospitalised to 
hospitalised to those hospitalised and treated in the ICU.  It varies from 16 and 53% of 
patients and occurs more frequently in patients after infection with the Alpha or Delta 
variants in comparison with patients infected with the Omicron variant.111 Major organ 
damage post-discharge among adults hospitalised for COVID-19, including incident cardiac, 
pulmonary, liver, acute and chronic kidney, stroke, diabetes, and coagulation disorders were 
consistently greater in adults hospitalised for COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-
controls in a meta-analysis of nine studies with follow-up of patients ranging from 4 to 22 
weeks post-discharge.135   
Cardiovascular sequelae in post-acute COVID-19 include dyspnea, chest pain, sinus 
bradycardia / dysrhythmias, palpitations and/or tachycardia, cerebrovascular disorders, 
pericarditis, myocarditis, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, thromboembolic events, right 
ventricular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, and hypertension.109-111 
Pulmonary symptoms and complications seen in long COVID include dyspnoea (occurring in 
15% of non-hospitalized patients and up to 81% of previously hospitalised patients), cough, 
chest pain, or decreased exercise tolerance.136

A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the long-term neurocognitive effects of 
COVID-19 in three studies comprised of 3,304 post-COVID-19 patients. Persistent 
neurological / cognitive sequelae of COVID-19 infection included headache 27.8%, fatigue 
26.7%, myalgia 23.14%, anosmia 22.8%, dysgeusia 12.1%, sleep disturbance 63.1%, 
confusion 32.6%, difficulty concentrating 22%, and psychiatric symptoms like PTSD 31%, 
feeling depressed 20%, and suicidality 2%.137 Dangayach et al. reports in a narrative review 
of the literature that neurologic complications in post-acute COVID-19 range from persistent 
fatigue, headaches, “brain fog”, depression, anxiety, and postural orthostatic tachycardia 
even in patients with mild disease.123  
Musculoskeletal disorders with long COVID, including persisting or new-onset fatigue, 
myalgia, arthralgia, arthritis, and muscle weakness, were noted in review of systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses that included 24 studies.127 
Important co-morbidities: 
As mentioned previously, there are a number of common comorbidities in patients with 
COVID-19; many of these conditions are also associated with more severe disease or 
progression of disease.   
Important comorbidities in those with more severe disease/hospitalised COVID-19 patients 
include hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, 
chronic pulmonary disease or asthma, chronic kidney disease, cancer, chronic liver disease, 
and autoimmune disease.14,19-21,34,50,60-68,97,99,138-140  Prevalence of these conditions have been 
reported to be lower in mild cases and higher among fatal cases, as shown for EU/EEA 
countries in Table 10 below using TESSy data posted on 04 November 2021.141

Table 11 below summarises comorbidities among US COVID-19 patients in a retrospective 
cohort study conducted among 629,953 individuals tested for COVID-19 in a large health 
system in the US Northwest between 01 March and 31 December 2020.27  The most common 
comorbidities were similar in the full cohort and among those who tested positive: obesity, 
hypertension, diabetes, and asthma.  Among those hospitalised for COVID-19, a large 
number of comorbidities had elevated prevalence compared to the full cohort and those who 
tested positive: obesity, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, congestive heart failure, 
coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In a retrospective cohort of 135,794 individuals under the age of 25 who were tested for 
COVID-19 by 08 September 2020 within the PEDSnet network of US paediatric health 
systems, the proportion of obese individuals was similar among those who tested negative 
(18%) and among mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (19%), but clearly elevated among 
severe COVID-19 cases (37%).31  Those with severe cases of COVID-19 more commonly 
had chronic conditions in at least two body systems, with 25% of COVID-19 negative 
individuals, 17% mild or asymptomatic cases, and 38% of severe cases having multiple 
chronic conditions. More recent data provide insight into comorbidities among the paediatric 
population.  For the period 01 January – 31 March 2021 across 14 states, the CDC’s COVID-

NET database recorded 204 adolescents aged 12-17 who were hospitalized for likely 
primarily COVID-related reasons.28  Among the 204 adolescents, 70.6% had at least one 
major underlying medical condition, the most common conditions being obesity (35.8%), 
chronic lung diseases including asthma (30.9%), and neurologic disorders (14.2%).28 A 
recent systematic review and meta-analysis using published reports through August 25, 2021 
revealed that prematurity in young infants (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.63–2.46), obesity (RR, 1.43; 
95% CI, 1.24–1.64), diabetes (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.95–2.62), chronic lung disease (RR, 2.62; 
95% CI, 1.71–4.00), heart disease (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.58–2.09), neurologic disease (RR, 
1.18; 95% CI, 1.05–1.33), and immunocompromised status (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01–2.04) 
were significant comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 (intensive care unit 
admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and/or death) in children.142 
Crossfield et al performed a population-based prospective study linking individual genetic, 
biomarker, survey and electronic health record data from >500 000 UK participants, aged 
40–69 years at recruitment (2006– 2010). The study used individual patient-level data from 
the UK BioBank database, linked to COVID-19 data sets from laboratories, hospitals, and 
death certificates. The study population included those who provided baseline assessment 
data, were alive at the start of the study period and had not withdrawn consent.  All subjects 
had a COVID-19 diagnosis by a positive laboratory test result or an ICD-10 code U071 or 
U072 recorded in hospital or death certificate data.  A cohort of 9560 patients with COVID-
19 of whom 50.8% (n=4,860) were women and 7,274 (76.1%) were White European were 
included.  The most common comorbidities of the study population included cardiovascular 
disease (12.8%), chronic respiratory disease (15.5%), chronic kidney disease (0.8), diabetes 
(7.1%), hypertension (28.6%), chronic liver disease (0.3%), and neurological disease (2.3%).  
The total number of comorbidities per subject was 0: 52.7%; 1: 31.7%; and  ≥2: 15.6%.50  
Alharbi et al conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional observational of patients in a COVID-
19-designated specialty hospital in Saudi Arabia. Over an 11-month period from March 2020 
to January 2021, corresponding to the first wave of infection in the country when therapeutic 
interventions had limited options and were mostly dependent on a given patient’s condition.  
A total of 619 patients’ records (non-ICU = 369 and ICU = 250 patients, 61.4% male, 6.3% 
age 0-20 yrs, 16.8% age 21-40, 27.9% age 41-60, and 48.9% age >60) with confirmed 
COVID-19 diagnosed with a real-time PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 were included.  The 
most common comorbidities of the study population included hypertension (59.8%), diabetes 
(47.2%), chronic pulmonary disease (43.1%), heart failure (13.2%), coronary artery disease 
(4.5%), and cancer (2.7%).97 
A prospective observational study of hospitalised patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and treated with advanced 
respiratory support (including high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, 
or invasive mechanical ventilation) during the first two years of the pandemic was conducted 
by Reyes et al.  Included were a total of 66,565 patients from five continents (63.5% male, 
82.6% hospitalised and treated in high-income countries, 78.2% hospitalised and treated in 
Europe, 44.0% between 60 and 80 years old) were included.  The most common 
comorbidities of the study population included arterial hypertension (41.3), diabetes mellitus 
(30.3%), chronic cardiac disease (not hypertension; 22.1%), asthma (12.2%), chronic kidney 
disease 11.3%), obesity (16.2%), chronic pulmonary disease (not asthma; 13.3%),

Ozonoff et al conducted a prospective, observational study of hospitalised patients with 
COVID-19 from 20 hospitals (affiliated with 15 academic institutions) across the US.   
Symptomatic patients ≥18 with confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were enrolled within 
48 hour of hospital admission.  Hospital admission data collected up to 11 November 2021 
was analyzed.  Between 05 May 2020 and 19 March 2021, 1,164 patients enrolled in the 
study and who met eligibility criteria were included in the final analysis.  The median age of 
the study population was 59 years (interquartile range 20), 61% were men, and 32% smoked 
or used vaporised nicotine products. The most common comorbid conditions included 
hypertension 58%, diabetes 37%, chronic lung disease (not asthma) 20%, asthma 15%, 
chronic cardiac disease 27%, chronic kidney disease 15%, chronic liver disease 5%, chronic 
neurologic disorder 12%, organ transplantation 5%, malignancy 10%, drug, or alcohol abuse 
8%, class 1-2 obesity (BMI=30-39.9) 41%, class 3 obesity (BMI=40+) 14%.14  
Lastly, an observational study of all COVID-19 patients admitted to 19 Dutch ICUs 
participating in both the national quality registry National Intensive Care Evaluation and the 
EHR-based Dutch Data Warehouse as conducted by Vagliano et al. A total of 1,533 patients 
from the EHR and 1,563 from the registry were included.  Subjects were ≥18 years old and 
were admitted between 15 February 2020 and 01 January 2021 with confirmed COVID-19 
by positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2 
or, in the early phase of the pandemic, with a Computed Tomography-scan consistent with 
COVID-19. The authors developed multiple models on data from the first 24 hours of ICU 
admissions from February to June 2020 (first wave) and validated the models on prospective 
patients admitted to the same ICUs between July and December 2020 (second wave). The 
authors reported the prevalence of the following comorbidities during the first and second 
waves, respectively, as follows: acute renal failure (9.5% and 9.3%), chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease failure (9.5% and 9.1%), chronic respiratory insufficiency (3.2% and 
2.0%), diabetes (21.5% and 26.9%).108

Module SII. Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification 
In December 2019, COVID-19 was identified as a new, potentially fatal, respiratory infection 
caused by SARS-CoV-2.144 SARS-CoV-2 infects cells through the ACE2 receptors with the 
lung and bronchial epithelial cells as the primary sites of infection.145  Like other 
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 encodes a main protease (Mpro), also referred to as 3C-like 
protease (3CLpro),146,147 which is a virally encoded enzyme essential for viral replication.148 
Mpro digests the virus P1a and P1ab polyproteins at multiple junctions to generate a series of 
proteins critical for virus replication and transcription, including RdRp, the helicase, and the 
Mpro itself.149 No close human analogs of the coronavirus Mpro are known.150 The essential 
functional importance in virus replication together with the absence of closely related 
homologs in humans, identify the Mpro as an attractive antiviral drug target.151 
Nirmatrelvir is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, exhibiting a 
broad-spectrum activity across the Coronaviridae family of Main proteases demonstrating its 
potential for antiviral efficacy. The critical amino acid residues involved in enzyme-inhibitor 
binding interactions are particularly well conserved within this family of viruses.152 
Inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro renders the protein incapable of processing polyprotein 
precursors which leads to the prevention of viral replication. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A-
mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir, thereby providing increased plasma concentrations of 
nirmatrelvir. 
The mechanism of action of nirmatrelvir has been demonstrated by various biochemical, 
crystallographic, and cell-based methods. Nirmatrelvir inhibited the full-length enzyme 
activity of SARS‑CoV-2 Mpro with a geomean IC50 of 0.0192 µM and a Ki of 0.00311 µM.  
In vitro antiviral activity of nirmatrelvir has been evaluated in VeroE6 derived, A549-ACE2, 
MRC-5, and dNHBE cells. In all cellular systems tested, nirmatrelvir demonstrated potent 
antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and pan-coronavirus antiviral efficacy against 
SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-229E . This activity is selective to the coronavirus 
family. Nirmatrelvir is inactive against enterovirus 71 and human rhinovirus B.153 
The antiviral activity of nirmatrelvir against the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, 
Lambda, Mu, and Omicron BA.1 variants was assessed in Vero E6 P-gp knockout cells. 
Nirmatrelvir had a median EC50 value of 25 nM (range: 16-141 nM). The Beta variant was 
the least susceptible variant tested, with an EC50 value fold-change of 3.7 relative to 
USA-WA1/2020. The other variants had EC50 value fold-changes ≤1.1 relative to USA-
WA1/2020. 
The antiviral activity of nirmatrelvir against the Omicron sub-variants BA.2, BA.2.12.1, 
BA.4, BA.4.6, BA.5, BF.7 (P252L+F294L), BF.7 (T243I), BQ.1.11, BQ.1, and XBB.1.5 was 
assessed in Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of a P-gp inhibitor. Nirmatrelvir had a 
median EC50 value of 83 nM (range: 39-146 nM) against the Omicron sub-variants, reflecting 
EC50 value fold-changes ≤1.5 relative to the USA-WA1/2020 isolate.   Nirmatrelvir also 
demonstrated cell culture antiviral activity in the Vero E6 TMPRSS cells against four clinical 
isolates of Delta variant with EC50 values approximately ≤2x compared to the SARS-COV-2 
USA-WA1/2020 strain.

Risk Management Plan 
19 April 2023 
The antiviral testing strategy for nirmatrelvir has followed the FDA Guidance on Antiviral 
Drug Development154 as well as the COVID 19 Guidance on Developing Drug and 
Biological Product155.  Different in vitro approaches were undertaken to evaluate potential 
nirmatrelvir resistance pathways, specifically:  
1.  Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro mutant enzyme activity in the presence of 
nirmatrelvir 
2.  Virus resistance selection in Vero E6 P-gp KO and A549-ACE2 cells with the same 
or increasing concentrations of nirmatrelvir (internal Pfizer laboratory) or in the 
literature.156,157 Resistance studies have also provided evidence for cross resistance to 
nirmatrelvir by other protease inhibitors.157,158 
A limited number of the putative resistance substitutions identified from the above assays, 
dominant Mpro mutations from Variants of Concern, mutations at contact resides, mutations 
identified from EPIC HR, and mutations circulating in GISAID (at a residue identified in 
resistance assay) were then tested for susceptibility to nirmatrelvir using reverse genetics.  
Viruses that had mutations in the Mpro gene were isolated from resistance selection under 
nirmatrelvir drug pressure or reverse engineered.  
•  Several mutant Mpro viruses were not viable and could not be evaluated in the reverse 
engineered recombinant SAR-CoV-2 assay: Y54A, F140A, F140I, F140S, S144E, 
S144L, S144P, S144T, E166V, H172Y, A173T, and A191V.

ND=no data (mutation emerged from nirmatrelvir resistance-selection but has not been tested for EC50 determination in 
an antiviral assay). 
Most single Mpro mutations and some double mutations identified which reduced the 
susceptibility of SARS CoV-2 to nirmatelvir resulted in an EC50 shift of less than ~5-fold 
compared to wild type SARS-CoV-2.  Virus containing E166V appears to have replication 
defect since it either could not be generated or had a very low virus titer.156 In general, triple 
mutations and some double mutations led to EC50 changes of greater than 5-fold compared to 
that of wild type.  The clinical significance of these mutations needs to be further understood 
particularly in the context of high nirmatrelvir clinical exposure (>5x EC90).  Thus far these 
mutations have not been identified as treatment-emergent mutations associated with

hospitalization in the EPIC clinical studies. Additionally, the sponsor has reviewed data 
submitted to GISAID. As of 31 December 2022, E166V as a single Mpro mutation did not 
occur in any of the ~13 million isolates and was only found in 16 out of ~13 million isolates 
when in combination with other Mpro mutations. 
Nirmatrelvir showed antiviral activity in BALB/c and AG-129 mice infected with mouse-
adapted SARS-CoV-2. Oral administration of nirmatrelvir at 300 mg/kg or 1,000 mg/kg 
twice daily initiated 4 hours post-inoculation or 1,000 mg/kg twice daily initiated 12 hours 
post-inoculation resulted in reduction of lung viral titers and ameliorated indicators of disease 
(weight loss and lung pathology) compared to vehicle-treated animals.  Additionally, 
nirmatrelvir as a single agent (300 mg/kg BID), ritonavir as a single agent (50 mg/kg BID) 
and in combination (50 mg/kg ritonavir + 300 mg/kg nirmatrelvir BID) were evaluated for 
antiviral efficacy in the BALB/c mouse SARS-CoV-2-MA-10 model. Ritonavir alone did not 
demonstrate antiviral activity against in vivo virus replication and did not contribute to 
amelioration of disease pathology, however, the combination of ritonavir and nirmatrelvir 
showed improved lung tissue protection compared to nirmatrelvir or ritonavir alone. This is 
most likely due to the increased plasma exposure levels of nirmatrelvir due to the inhibition 
of CYP3A-mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir by ritonavir. 
Studies on the secondary pharmacology evaluated in vitro activity of nirmatrelvir against a 
wide panel of receptors, transporters, ion channels and enzyme assays, and the results 
indicated no significant inhibition (>50%) of functional or enzyme activity, with the 
exception of submicromolar activity against cathepsin K (IC50 = 231 nM compared to 
activity against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro IC50 = 4 nM) as reported in the literature from a panel of 
20 cysteine proteases.159  
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted to assess potential pharmacodynamic effects on 
vital organ systems (central nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory). Oral administration of 
up to 1000 mg/kg of nirmatrelvir to male Wistar Han rats produced no test article-related 
effects on FOB parameters, but at 1000 mg/kg there were test article-related lower number of 
mean vertical movement counts during the first 5-minute period and a higher number of 
mean horizontal and vertical movement counts during the last 30-minute period of the 
quantitative locomotor assessment compared with vehicle control. Translatability of these 
findings to humans is uncertain. Administration of 1000 mg/kg also resulted in transient test 
article-related higher respiratory rate and minute volume compared with vehicle control. 
Nirmatrelvir administered at 150 (75 BID) mg/kg/day to cynomolgus monkeys produced 
minor and transient effects such as increased systolic, diastolic and mean BP, HR decreases, 
and associated RR, PR, and QT interval increases. When the QT interval was corrected for 
HR (QTc), there was a test article-related decrease. No arrhythmias were noted. Nirmatrelvir 
at 150 (75 BID) mg/kg/day also produced decreases in LV +dP/dt max. All measures 
returned to vehicle control levels within 24 HPD, and there was no clinically meaningful 
effect of nirmatrelvir on hERG, isolated guinea pig heart or isolated rat aorta assays. 
The potential effects on safety pharmacology parameters were monitored in the clinic (eg, 
ECG) and had no correlating clinical signs or histopathological findings in the 4 repeat-dose 
GLP toxicity studies up to 1 month in duration in rats or monkeys. ECG data were also 
collected in the 15-day and 1-month GLP monkey studies and there were no test article-

related changes in ECG parameters (HR, RR-, PR-, QRS-, QT-, QTc-intervals) or ECG 
morphology in those studies. 
The ADME profile of nirmatrelvir has been extensively studied in various in vitro and in 
vivo studies. In the pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, mean systemic 
exposure of nirmatrelvir increased with increasing dose and there were no consistent sex-
related differences. 
Nirmatrelvir exhibited low passive permeability and was moderately bound to plasma 
proteins in rat, monkey and human and preferentially partitioned into plasma relative to red 
blood cells. Concentration-dependent protein binding was observed in rabbit plasma but not 
in rat, monkey, and human. [14C]Nirmatrelvir-derived radioactivity did not cross the 
blood:brain barrier to a quantifiable extent in rats consistent with it being a substrate for 
P-gp.  
CYP3A4 was the major contributor (fm=0.99) to the oxidative metabolism of nirmatrelvir. In 
clinical studies, ritonavir was co-administered with nirmatrelvir to inhibit CYP3A4 and 
increase plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir. In vivo, unchanged nirmatrelvir was the most 
prevalent drug-related entity in circulation in rat, monkey, and human plasma, with M4 
(PF-07329268) as a primary circulating metabolite in monkey. In a human mass-balance 
study of nirmatrelvir coadministered with ritonavir, the majority of nirmatrelvir-related 
material was excreted as unchanged parent (55% in urine and 28% in feces). 
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir demonstrated clinical DDI as a perpetrator with substrates of CYP3A4 
and P-gp, but nirmatrelvir/ritonavir had little to no incremental effect on the DDI beyond that 
produced by ritonavir alone. The risk of other transporter DDI is not considered significant. 
The toxicity of nirmatrelvir was evaluated in 4 GLP repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 
1 month in duration in Wistar Han rats and cynomolgus monkeys. There were no adverse 
findings in any of the studies. The NOAELs were the highest dose administered in each study 
and represented 13x/9x (Cmax/AUC24) and 26x/16x (Cmax/AUC24) in the 1-month rat and 
monkey studies, respectively, over the human total nirmatrelvir Cmax and AUC24 at a dose of 
300/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir BID. Nonadverse, nirmatrelvir-related clinical findings 
included sporadic reports of salivation and soft feces in the 1-month rat study, and sporadic 
occurrence of emesis with slight body weight decreases in monkeys. In rats, nonadverse, 
monitorable and reversible clinical pathology findings included those suggestive of low-
grade inflammation or alterations in the coagulation pathways without clinical or 
microscopic correlates. In monkeys, nonadverse, monitorable and generally reversible 
clinical pathology findings included increases in ALT and/or AST and increases in 
fibrinogen at the high dose in the 1-month study without clinical or microscopic correlates. 
Changes consistent with a rat-specific response to hepatic enzyme induction resulting in 
increased thyroxine catabolism, raised serum thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid 
follicular cell hypertrophy and anterior pituitary vacuolation were observed relative to 
controls in both 14-day and 1-month rat toxicity studies.160-162 This mechanism is considered 
to have little to no relevance to humans mostly because of the marked differences in plasma 
half-life of thyroid hormones and in binding to transport proteins between rodents and 
humans.162.

Nirmatrelvir had no adverse effects on male or female fertility in rats, fetal morphology or 
embryo-fetal viability in rats and rabbits, or PPND in rats when evaluated at doses up to 
1000 mg/kg/day. The exposure margins at 1000 mg/kg/day were 5x, 9x, 11x, and 9x in the 
fertility, EFD rat, EFD rabbit, and PPND study, respectively, based on AUC24 over the total 
clinical exposure of nirmatrelvir. In the rat fertility and EFD studies, there were no adverse 
effects from nirmatrelvir. In the rabbit EFD study, there were no nirmatrelvir-related effects 
on fetal morphology or embryo-fetal viability, although adverse nirmatrelvir-related lower 
fetal body weights were observed at 1000 mg/kg/day in the presence of low magnitude 
effects on maternal body weight change and food consumption at this dose. In the PPND 
study, there were no adverse effects of nirmatrelvir on the F0 and F1 generation. Therefore, 
nirmatrelvir presents little risk to reproductive and developmental function of humans.  
Nirmatrelvir was not mutagenic or clastogenic in in vitro genetic toxicity studies and was 
negative in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay incorporated into the 14-day GLP repeat-dose 
rat toxicity study. Nirmatrelvir does not present a photo toxicity risk based on UV-Vis 
absorbance evaluation. 
In a 14-day impurity qualification rat study, administration of 200 mg/kg/day nirmatrelvir 
with increased amounts of multiple impurities (PF-07336592, PF-07801198, PF-07832587, 
and PF-07800841 or PF-07863403, PF-07328615, and PF-07858529) did not alter the safety 
profile of nirmatrelvir. 
The non-clinical studies performed adequately support the oral administration of nirmatrelvir 
in the clinic. 
In summary, the non-clinical safety findings related to nirmatrelvir primarily represent 
monitorable and reversible clinical pathology findings included those suggestive of low-
grade inflammation or alterations in the coagulation pathways in rats, or increases in ALT,

Safety pharmacology: 
•  Nirmatrelvir administered at 
150 (75 BID) mg/kg/day to cynomolgus 
monkeys produced minor and transient effects 
such as increased BP, HR decreases, and 
associated RR, PR, and QT interval 
increases. When the QT interval was corrected 
for HR (QTc), there was a test article-related 
decrease. No arrhythmias were noted. 
Nirmatrelvir at 150 (75 BID) mg/kg/day also 
produced decreases in LV +dP/dt max.  There 
was no clinically meaningful effect of 
nirmatrelvir on hERG, isolated guinea pig 
heart or isolated rat aorta assays. 
No adverse changes in ECG parameters, BP or 
HR have been observed in the clinical setting.

and C4671006 (refer to Table 19).  
Data from the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in pregnant 
women are limited. 
SmPC warns on the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in 
pregnant and breastfeeding women.  
Breastfeeding women were excluded from the

and C4671006 (refer to Table 19). 
Data are not available to assess the effects of 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on the breastfed infant or on milk 
production/excretion. It is unknown whether nirmatrelvir 
is excreted in human or animal milk. There is no 
information on the effects of ritonavir on the breast-fed 
newborns/infants or the effects of the medicinal product on 
milk production. Therefore, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is not 
recommended during breastfeeding. 
Participants with active liver diseases or acute liver failure 
were excluded from the pivotal studies C4671002, 
C4671005 and C4671006 (refer to Table 19). For available 
exposure of hepatic impaired participants (in the pivotal 
studies said above), please refer to Table 18. 
Participants with moderate and severe renal impairment 
were excluded from the pivotal study C4671002, 
C4671005 and C4671006 as they require dose 
adjustments.  
For available exposure of renal impaired participants (in

SV.1. Post-Authorisation Exposure 
19 April 2023 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the number of individuals who received 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.  The estimated exposure and the method used to calculate it are 
included in Section SV.1.2 and Section SV.1.1, respectively. 
SV.1.1. Method Used to Calculate Exposure 
Based on the estimated exposure in USb, data made publicly available by Competent 
Authorities in some countries (ie, UKc, Italyd, Austriae, Japanf and Thailandg) and the 
number of Company’s shipped packs in the above said 6 countries, an “Average percentage 
of use” is calculated:  
approximately 20.6% of the total shipped packs have been estimated to be administered to 
the patients from data in these 6 countries.  
This percentage is applied to the shipments to the other countries worldwide. 
To provide an estimation of exposure by gender and age group, available datah (percentage of 
written prescriptions) provided by IQVIA Health Prescribing Insights Medical are used.  
SV.1.2. Exposure 
With the methodology above (refer to Section SV.1.1)i, it has been estimated that 11,646,361 
patients have been exposed cumulatively to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir from the first EUA in US 
(on 22 December 2021) up to 31 December 2022.  
b In US the estimation of the patient’s exposure is calculated based on the number of packages shipped by 
US Wholesaler to the US POCs (approximately 10,950,698 packs up to 03 January 2023) and the number of 
packs still available in US POCs (based on the published data on COVID-19 Public Therapeutic Locator as of

Module SVI. Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification 
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir does not have characteristics that would make it attractive for use for 
illegal purposes; therefore, no potential for drug abuse or dependence with 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is expected. 
Module SVII. Identified and Potential Risks 
The safety data available indicates that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has a favorable safety profile in 
the studied population. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was well tolerated for 5 days of dosing in high-
risk individuals with COVID-19 as well as individuals with standard risk. The safety profile 
remained generally consistent when nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was used for either 5 or 10 days 
Based on this, no important risks have been determined for inclusion in the RMP.  
The “Safety in patients with hepatic impairment”, “Safety in patients with renal impairment” 
and the “Safety during use in pregnancy and lactation” are determined to be missing 
information for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir due to the exclusion of these populations from the 
pivotal studies C4671002, C4671005 and C4671006. Please refer to the Risk-Benefit impact 
summarized below in Section SVII.1.2 for each safety concern. 
- different time required to distribute packs in different countries; 
- the incidence of COVID-19 infection; 
- despite MAH’s shipments, in some countries the product could not be available yet on the market.

SVII.1.1. Risks not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP 
Not all potential or identified risks for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are considered to meet the level 
of importance necessitating inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. 
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP: 
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but associated with longer 
treatment duration and/or occurring with a low frequency and considered to be acceptable in 
relation to the severity of the indication treated:  
Hepatotoxicity  
Hypertension 
Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for 
which the risk minimisation measures in the product information are adhered by prescribers 
(eg, actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member state where the 
product is authorised): 
•  Allergic reactions/Hypersensitivity  
•  Drug-drug interactions (with CYP3A substrates and CYP3A inducers) 
The risks of Hypersensitivity, Hepatotoxicity and Drug-drug interactions (with CYP3A 
substrates and CYP3A inducers) are described in the SmPC and PL. It is anticipated that 
these risks can be adequately minimised by routine risk minimisation and will not require 
additional risk minimisation measures. These risks will also be characterised through routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
To further support the risk minimisation of drug-drug interactions, a QR code and website 
link have been included on the PL and the outer carton. They link to the MAH product 
website that includes a drug interaction tool, which provides another mechanism to 
communicate the drug interactions listed in the SmPC, in a searchable format.

the RMP 
Important Identified Risk: None 
Important Potential Risk: None. 
Missing information 1: Safety in patients with hepatic impairment 
Risk-benefit impact: Participants with known medical history of active liver disease (other 
than nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis), including chronic or active hepatitis B or C infection, 
primary biliary cirrhosis, Child-Pugh Class B or C, or acute liver failure, have been excluded 
from the pivotal studies C4671005, C4671002 and C4671006.  
Characterisation of the effect of moderate hepatic impairment on the plasma and urine PK of 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has been investigated within a Phase I study (C4671010). No data are 
currently available in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Ritonavir is principally 
metabolised and eliminated by the liver, and hepatic adverse events (including hepatic 
transaminase elevations exceeding five times the upper limit or normal, clinical hepatitis, and 
jaundice) have been reported to have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir, at higher dose 
and longer duration as an antiretroviral agent. An increased risk for severe and potentially 
fatal hepatic adverse reactions in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with 
combined antiretroviral therapy has been also reported for ritonavir.  
Further characterisation of the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in the hepatic impaired patients 
is needed to identify specific higher risks of clinically negative outcomes in this population. 
Missing information 2: Safety in patients with renal impairment 
Risk-benefit impact: When dosed with ritonavir, the primary clearance mechanism of 
nirmatrelvir is via renal excretion of unchanged drug. Significant increases in plasma 
concentrations of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients who were moderately or severely impaired 
can occur.  Based on PK-derived analysis (from study C4671011), dosing recommendations 
of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 150 mg/100 mg for patients with moderate renal impairment have 
been included in SmPC. No data are available yet in patients with severe renal impairment.  
Further characterization of the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in the renal impaired patients is 
required to identify specific risks or difference in the safety profile in this patient population. 
Missing information 3: Safety during use in pregnancy and lactation 
Risk-benefit impact: Pregnant women are excluded from the pivotal clinical studies.  
Considering the serious consequences of COVID-19 in pregnant people and that pregnant 
people at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19 disease may need to be treated with 
antiviral medication based on an overall benefit-risk judgement, it is important to 
characterise the safety profile of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in this population and the effect on 
foetal development, as well as on babies exposed via breastfeeding.

PART III. PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST-
AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES) 
III.1. Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities 
Routine pharmacovigilance for the lifecycle of a product is a critical component to the 
detection, assessment, understanding and mitigation of AEs.  Objectives of routine 
pharmacovigilance includes having processes in place to assure the ongoing and timely 
collection, processing, follow-up, and analysis of individual AE reports and aggregate data 
globally, following global safety Standard Operating Procedures and regulatory guidance.  
Pfizer monitors the safety profile of its products, evaluates issues potentially impacting 
product benefit-risk profiles in a timely manner, and ensures that appropriate communication 
of relevant safety information is conveyed in a timely manner to regulatory authorities and 
other interested parties as appropriate and in accordance with international principles and 
prevailing regulations.     
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal 
detection: 
•  Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires:  
Pregnancy follow-up questionnaires (Exposure During Pregnancy Follow-up Questionnaire 
for non-study cases and Exposure During Pregnancy Supplemental Form for study cases 
attached in Annex 4) are also utilized to collect further data on pregnancy outcome and 
reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
A Data Capture Aid has been created to gather data about the safety during use in lactation 
(refer to Annex 4). 
Two further DCAs, for lack of efficacy (including fields to request information on the 
COVID-19 variant) and for hypertension are in Annex 4. 
•  Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities: 
As part of the enhanced signal detection activities for the duration of the COVID-19 
pandemic, monitoring of data on treatment failure due to emerging variants from all 
available data sources, will include (not limited to): 
•  Spontaneous cases (using a targeted follow-up questionnaire for lack of efficacy as 
stated above) 
•  Clinical trial data  
•  Literature  
•  Studies conducted by public health authorities 
If the review of the data leads to an impact on the benefit risk of the product, a benefit-risk 
discussion and any warranted product information updates will be submitted within 1 month 
from assessment via appropriate variation procedure. Additionally, the interval and 
cumulative data will be summarised in a dedicated section in the PSUR.

PART V. RISK MINIMISATION MEASURES (INCLUDING EVALUATION OF 
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES) 
Risk Minimisation Plan 
V.1. Routine Risk Minimisation Measures 
No safety concerns have been identified for which actions other than routine risk 
minimisation activities are necessary.  
Beyond SmPC and PL, the routine risk minimization activities for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
include the pack size and medicine’s legal status.  
To support the risk minimisation of drug-drug interactions beyond the label, a QR code and 
website link have been included on the PL and the outer carton. They link to the MAH 
product website that includes a drug interaction tool, which provides another mechanism to 
communicate the drug interactions listed in the SmPC, in a searchable format.   
Table 29 and Table 30 present the planned risk minimisation activities for the missing 
information “Safety in patients with hepatic impairment”, “Safety in patients with renal 
impairment” and “Safety during use in pregnancy and lactation”.

Risk Management Plan 
19 April 2023 
PART VI. SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN  
Summary of risk management plan for Paxlovid (Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Paxlovid. The RMP details 
important risks of Paxlovid, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Paxlovid's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Paxlovid's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Paxlovid should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Paxlovid should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Paxlovid's RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Paxlovid is authorised for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults 
who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased high risk for progressing 
to severe COVID-19 (see SmPC for full indication). It contains nirmatrelvir in combination 
with ritonavir as the active substances and it is given by oral route.  
Further information about the evaluation of Paxlovid’s benefits can be found in Paxlovid’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/paxlovid. 
II. Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Paxlovid, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Paxlovid's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 68 
 
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
Risk Management Plan 
19 April 2023 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Paxlovid is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Paxlovid are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there 
is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Paxlovid. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

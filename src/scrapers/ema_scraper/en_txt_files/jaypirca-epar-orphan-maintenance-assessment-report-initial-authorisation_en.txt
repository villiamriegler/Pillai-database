2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2021 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing (S)-5-amino-3-(4-((5-
fluoro-2-methoxybenzamido)methyl)phenyl)-1-(1,1,1-trifluoropropane-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-
carboxamide was considered justified based on durable and high overall response rates in late line 
treatment of mantle cell lymphoma patients, who were treated with the product as monotherapy; 
the condition is life-threatening with a median survival of 3 to 5 years and chronically debilitating 
due to lymphadenopathy, night sweats, fever, and weight loss; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.6 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, the 
sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing (S)-5-amino-3-(4-((5-fluoro-2-methoxybenzamido)methyl)phenyl)-1-(1,1,1-
trifluoropropane-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide will be of significant benefit to those affected by 
the condition. The sponsor has provided clinical data that show responses in a heavily pre-treated 
relapsed/refractory population. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). It 
constitutes 5–7% of malignant lymphoma in Western Europe (Dreyling et al., 2017). The entity is 
divided in two major subgroups with distinct clinical and molecular features, specifically nodal MCL and 
leukaemic non-nodal MCL according to the 5th edition of the World Health Organisation (WHO) 
classification of haematological malignancies (WHO-HAEM5) of the type lymphoid neoplasms from 
2022 (Alaggio et al., 2022). It is a B-cell malignancy with a broad spectrum of clinical, pathological, 
and biological features, affecting men and women with a ratio of around 3:1. Patients with MCL are 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000124200 
Page 4/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
often diagnosed with advanced disease (Stage III/IV), characterized by an aggressive clinical course, 
and the median age at diagnosis is 68 years. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Jaypirca as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have been previously treated 
with a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor” falls within the scope of the designated orphan 
condition “Treatment of mantle cell lymphoma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility is confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There is no change of the severity of the condition since the orphan designation was granted in 2021 
that has been identified by the sponsor. The COMP has previously accepted that MCL is life-threatening 
with a median survival of 3 to 5 years and chronically debilitating due to lymphadenopathy, night 
sweats, fever, fatigue, and weight loss in the untreated state. The majority of patients will relapse, 
with median OS of around 10-13 months in patients who have progressed after chemotherapy and 
treatment with approved targeted agents. The severe nature of the condition earlier acknowledged by 
the COMP remains acceptable for this maintenance procedure. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of the orphan designation in 2021, the COMP concluded that the condition was estimated 
to be affecting approximately 0.6 in 10,000 persons in the European Union (EU). 
The sponsor conducted an updated literature and database search to determine the current prevalence 
of MCL in the European community. Published data from global and regional population-based cancer 
registries and other relevant sources including Global Cancer Incidence and Mortality (GLOBOCAN; 
2020), European Cancer Information System (ECIS; 2022) and Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Prevalence 
and Survival in the Nordic Countries (NORDCAN; 2012-2016) were searched. In addition, literature 
searches on PubMed/Medline (1950 to present) and Embase (1988 to present) for peer-reviewed 
articles reporting relevant data for a prevalence estimate of MCL in Europe were conducted. The 
Eurostat database (EC; 2020) was used as the source of total population data. 
Both direct and indirect methods were applied to estimate the prevalence of MCL. For the direct 
methods, direct reporting of prevalence of MCL in peer-reviewed literature as well as web-based 
databases and registries was extracted. For the indirect methods, estimation of the prevalence for MCL 
was established indirectly using the standard formula P (point prevalence) = I (incidence) × D (mean 
duration), under the assumption of stable incidence and duration of the condition. Table 1 below 
recapitulates the different methodologies used as well as respective results.

The 48 cancer registries operated in Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, England, Northern Ireland, 
Based on the results from the 3 different approaches applied and the epidemiological data found, the 
sponsor proposed a range for a 5-year prevalence estimate of 0.27-1.12 per 10,000 persons with a 
final estimate of 0.61 per 10,000 people in the EU. The proposed prevalence is based on an estimated 
5-year prevalence for NHL in the 27 EU member states (EU27; GLOBOCAN and Eurostat, 2020 data) 
and the upper end of the reported proportion of MCL cases within all NHL cases in Europe and North 
America of 2-10% (Sant et al., 2010; Dreyling et al., 2017; Jain and Wang 2019). The data used for 
the estimates are representative of data available from the ECIS database. 
The proposed prevalence is the same estimate as was concluded on at the time of the orphan 
designation and in line with the value accepted for MCL in the orphan maintenance procedure for 
Tecartus at the time of marketing authorisation (MA) in 2020 (EU/1/20/1492). The COMP concluded 
that no significant changes have occurred since then in the prevalence of MCL, and a final prevalence 
estimate of 0.6 per 10,000 persons in the EU was therefore considered acceptable.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor described several EU approved therapies commonly used for treatment of MCL. Targeted 
therapies currently authorized in the community for treatment of MCL include bortezomib (Velcade and 
generics) for newly diagnosed patients not candidates for stem cell transplantation (SCT), and ibrutinib 
(Imbruvica), lenalidomide (Revlimid and generics), temsirolimus (Torisel), and the anti-CD19 chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T-cell product brexucabtagene autoleucel (Tecartus; hereinafter 
referred to as brexu-cel) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) disease. Several 
other medicinal products are also authorised either centrally or nationally in the community for the 
treatment of the proposed condition, including cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, 
bendamustine, fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone, methotrexate, cytarabine, carmustine, 
chlorambucil, bleomycin, etoposide, epirubicin, ifosfamide, melphalan, pixantrone, and vinblastin. 
The latest ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of newly diagnosed 
and relapsed MCL describe the recommended treatment options available for these patients (Dreyling, 
Ann Oncol. 2017; 28(S4): iv62-71). In the r/r disease setting, where the sponsor’s product will be 
used, an optimal sequence of treatments has not been established. The selection of a proper regimen 
in this setting is influenced by response duration to prior therapy, co-morbidities, tumour chemo-
sensitivity, and overall risk-benefit evaluations. Both ibrutinib (Imbruvica), lenalidomide (Revlimid and 
generics), and temsirolimus (Torisel) are specifically authorised for patients with r/r MCL. Furthermore, 
brexu-cel (Tecartus) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with r/r MCL after two or more 
lines of systemic therapy including a BTK inhibitor. 
The sponsor’s product Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib) is intended to treat adult patients with r/r MCL who have 
previously been treated with a BTK inhibitor. Since the therapeutic indication pertains explicitly to 
patients who had been previously treated with a BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib (Imbruvica) is not considered a 
satisfactory method. Additionally, it should be considered that ibrutinib is already at least a second-line 
treatment, as it is intended for patients with r/r MCL. This makes pirtobrutinib a treatment option in 
the third- and later lines setting. Considering this, lenalidomide, temsirolimus, and brexu-cel are the 
medicinal products considered satisfactory methods for the purpose of this orphan review procedure 
and relevant for a discussion on the significant benefit of pirtobrutinib in MCL. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor did not seek any protocol assistance from EMA regarding the evidence needed to justify 
significant benefit of pirtobrutinib over existing methods of treatment for patients with r/r MCL who 
had received prior treatment with a BTK inhibitor. 
The sponsor argued that pirtobrutinib is of significant benefit based on a clinically relevant advantage 
in terms of improved efficacy and safety in comparison to existing therapies for patients with r/r MCL 
in the post-BTK inhibitor setting. Ibrutinib is the only BTK inhibitor currently authorised in the EU for 
the treatment of MCL and is the preferred treatment option in the second line setting. Moreover, the 
sponsor claimed that pirtobrutinib also provides a significant benefit to MCL patients who have already 
received treatment with brexu-cel and for whom no approved therapy is available.

Pirtobrutinib (also called LOXO-305 or LY3527727) is a small molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-
competitive and reversible non-covalent inhibitor of BTK. BTK, which is a member of the TEC family of 
non-receptor tyrosine kinases, is predominantly expressed in B-cells. The kinase is an important B-cell 
receptor (BCR) signalling molecule and highly implicated in the development of lymphoproliferative 
disorders (Seiler and Dreyling, 2017). Pirtobrutinib has therefore the potential to prevent B-cell 
development and survival by targeting BTK and its underlying signalling. 
The primary data supporting efficacy and safety of pirtobrutinib in r/r MCL in the conditional MA (CMA) 
application were obtained from the ongoing global multicentre, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-
expansion first-in-human (FIH) phase 1/2 study 18001 (also called BRUIN). The study was designed to 
evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of oral pirtobrutinib in adult 
patients with r/r B-cell NHL or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) 
who have failed or are intolerant to standard of care. Patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of 
MCL from the phase 1 and phase 2 parts, irrespective of starting dose, were pooled together to form 
the primary analysis set (PAS) of MCL patients who had previously been treated with a BTK inhibitor-
containing regimen and received at least one dose of pirtobrutinib as monotherapy (N=90). The data 
cut-off (DCO) date for the efficacy and safety analyses provided was 29-Jul-2022. 
The primary objective for the phase 1 dose escalation and expansion was to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oral pirtobrutinib, which was established 
at 200 mg once daily (QD) and no MTD was reached. The primary objective of the phase 2 part is to 
assess the preliminary antitumour activity of pirtobrutinib based on overall response rate (ORR) as 
assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) as per the IWG Lugano classification criteria 
(Cheson et al., 2014). Secondary efficacy endpoints included ORR by investigator assessment, best 
overall response (BOR), duration of response (DOR), time to any and best response, and progression-
free survival (PFS) by IRC and investigator assessment, and overall survival (OS). 
The median age of the patients with MCL in the PAS was 70.0 years (range: 46-87). In line with the 
usual distribution between men and women with MCL, a marked male predominance (80.0%; 72/90) 
relative to females (20.0%; 18/92) was observed. The majority of patients were white (84.4%) and 
had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of either 0 (67.8%) or 
1 (31.1%). Only one patient (1.1%) had an ECOG score of 2. The median number of prior therapies 
was 3 (range: 1-8). All patients had received a prior BTK inhibitor-based regimen, 95.6% (86/90) had 
received prior anti-CD20 therapy, and 87.8% (79/90) had previously been treated with chemotherapy. 
A total of 82.2% (74/90) of the patients had discontinued treatment with any prior BTK inhibitor due to 
progression, whereas 21.1% (19/90) of the patients had progressed following prior autologous- and/or 
allogeneic SCT. Only 4.4% (4/90) of the patients had previously received CAR-T cell therapy. 
The median study follow-up time in the PAS at the DCO was 10.45 months (range: 0.5-34.4) and the 
median time on treatment for all patients in this cohort was 5.24 months (range: 0.2-33.7). The ORR 
by IRC assessment in the PAS was 56.7% (51/90; 95% CI: 45.8, 67.1), where 18.9% (17/90) of the 
patients achieved a complete response (CR) and 37.8% (34/90) obtained a partial response (PR). The 
responses to pirtobrutinib occurred rather quickly after initiation of treatment with a median time to 
response (TTR) among responding patients of 1.8 months by IRC assessment and they were durable 
with a median DOR of 17.6 months (95% CI: 7.3, 27.2) by IRC assessment. By KM analysis of the IRC 
assessment, an estimated 61.1% (95% CI: 44.1, 74.3) of the responders remained event-free (from 
disease progression or death) at 9 months and 58.0% (95% CI: 41.0, 71.7) remained event-free at 12 
months. The median PFS and OS were 7.4 months (95% CI: 5.3, 13.3) by IRC assessment and 23.5 
months (95% CI: 15.9, NE), respectively.

The efficacy of pirtobrutinib was evaluated in the PAS based on analyses of subgroups. Forest plots of 
ORR observed in relevant subgroups for the PAS based on the IRC assessment are shown in Figure 1.

Significant benefit over existing non-CAR-T cell therapies 
It was noted that the response rates to chemo-immunotherapy given as post-ibrutinib salvage therapy 
are as low as 27% (Jain et al., 2018). The regimen of rituximab-bendamustine-cytarabine (R-BAC) has 
been recently reported to have a promising ORR of 83% in relapsed MCL population, albeit in a small 
retrospective study of 36 patients who had not received a prior bendamustine-containing regimen. In 
current clinical practice, bendamustine-containing regimens, including R-BAC, are more commonly 
utilized in first line consistent with guidelines (McCulloch et al., 2020; NCCN 2022), and prospective 
studies of outcomes with R-BAC in relapsed patients previously exposed to bendamustine have not 
been reported or undertaken. Furthermore, R-BAC is associated with significant toxicities, such as high 
grade cytopenia, a high proportion of patients requiring dose reductions for toxicity (56% overall, 90% 
for patients aged at least 70 years) or blood transfusion support (68%), and a considerable number of 
patients requiring unplanned hospital admissions (50%, McCulloch et al., 2020). Overall R-BAC has 
limited utility and is not commonly used (Tisi et al., 2018; Bega et al., 2021). 
The sponsor highlighted that available data from the pivotal study have shown that treatment with 
pirtobrutinib resulted in a clinically meaningful ORR with the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of 
45.8%, which exceeded that of 20 to 30% reported for the available monotherapy salvage therapies of 
lenalidomide, temsirolimus, and bortezomib, whose ORR results were generated in a BTK inhibitor-
naive population. In addition, a DOR of 17.6 months by IRC assessment in response to pirtobrutinib 
compared favourably with the reported historical median DOR of 3 to 5.8 months with other commonly 
available approaches following prior ibrutinib therapy (Cheah et al. 2015; Epperla et al. 2017). Even 
when limiting evaluation of the efficacy of pirtobrutinib to patients with MCL who progressed on their 
most recent BTK inhibitor, the ORR of 48.6% (36/74; 95% CI: 36.9, 60.6) remained robust. 
Consistent with the limited efficacy seen for targeted agents or chemo-immunotherapy following 
progression on BTK inhibitors, the survival of MCL patients who were pre-treated with a BTK inhibitor 
has been reported to be very poor, with median OS ranging from 2.5 to 8.4 months (Cheah et al., 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000124200 
Page 9/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2015; Martin et al., 2016; Epperla et al., 2017). The OS observed for pirtobrutinib thus compared 
favourably to the OS results in the real-world patient populations in the post-BTK inhibitor setting. 
According to the sponsor, the data are particularly noteworthy in this heavily pre-treated patient 
population that received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (including BTK inhibitors, anti-CD20 
therapy, chemotherapy, immunomodulators, transplant, BCL2 inhibitor, and CAR-T cells), and that 
included patients with poor prognostic characteristics such as intermediate and high sMIPI, bulky 
disease, and blastoid/pleomorphic. 
The COMP noted that the descriptive data presented indicated an improvement in ORR and DOR in 
patients with r/r MCL who were treated with pirtobrutinib in study 18001 compared to the 
monotherapy salvage therapies lenalidomide, temsirolimus, and bortezomib. Nevertheless, significant 
benefit based on improved efficacy of pirtobrutinib over lenalidomide and temsirolimus could not be 
established, since no methodologically sound indirect comparisons of the efficacy of pirtobrutinib 
versus lenalidomide and temsirolimus were provided by the sponsor to establish a clinically relevant 
advantage. Furthermore, no efficacy analyses for pirtobrutinib in relevant subgroups of patients with 
r/r MCL from the pivotal study who had progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with lenalidomide 
and temsirolimus has been presented by the sponsor. 
The sponsor further argued that although results in study 18001 are not directly comparable to other 
studies, the safety profile of pirtobrutinib is arguably better than those reported for currently available 
therapies in the target patient population, including R-BAC, which as discussed above in the previous 
paragraphs, has unfavourable, life-threatening, and potentially fatal toxicities (McCulloch et al., 2020). 
This argument is not considered valid because of the lack of comparability between the clinical studies 
and based on immature data with the new product from a single-arm study with limited follow-up. 
Significant benefit over the approved CAR-T-cell product 
The CD19-directed CAR-T cell product brexu-cel (Tecartus) is the only medicinal product that has 
demonstrated efficacy in a BTK inhibitor pre-treated MCL population comparable to the one studied in 
study 18001. Tecartus was recently approved in the EU (CMA: 14/12/2020) based on data from an 
open-label, multicenter, single-arm phase 2 study called ZUMA-2, which was conducted in patients 
with MCL who had relapsed on a BTK inhibitor (N=74 ITT/68 mITT). Despite an impressive ORR of 
93% (56/60) with a CR rate of 67%, this therapy is associated with significant toxicities with Grade ≥3 
AEs occurring in 99% of the patients studied (Tecartus SmPC; Wang et al., 2020a). 
The sponsor argued that CAR-T cell therapy carries significant logistical challenges as well as the 
potential severe toxicities of the therapy, which limits this treatment modality to those being fit and 
have slowly progressing disease to make it through the treatment. Successful leukapheresis, product 
manufacture, potential bridging chemotherapy, and conditioning therapy prior to cell infusion are all 
required to prescribe CAR-T cell therapy. In the single-arm study leading to approval of brexu-cel, 4% 
of the patients could not receive cell infusion due to complications and the product manufacture failed 
in another 4% of the patients (Wang et al., 2020a). In a community practice environment, where 
expertise may be lacking, CAR-T cell therapy may therefore be more challenging than described. 
Safety concerns associated with CAR-T cell therapy, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 
neurological toxicity, have not been observed as safety risks for pirtobrutinib. Additionally, pirtobrutinib 
does not require the intensive logistical processes associated with CAR-T cell products, such as cell 
collection and processing, patient conditioning, and bridging chemotherapy for which 8% of clinical trial 
participants could not receive prescribed treatment as described. While CAR-T cell therapy is an option

patients with MCL who have been pre-treated with a BTK inhibitor, including those unable to receive 
CAR-T cell therapy or for whom CAR-T cell therapy has been unsuccessful. 
In study 18001, 13 patients with MCL were enrolled and treated following prior CAR-T cell therapy. A 
summary of the patient demographics from the DCO of 31-Jan-2022 showed that all 13 patients had 
received previous BTK inhibitor therapy, with a median number of prior lines of systemic therapy 
ranging from 5 to 6 (range: 4-8) across the analysis sets presented. A pooled ORR for patients with 
prior CAR-T cell therapy and prior BTK inhibitor therapy was 46.2% (6/13; all PR), which is clinically 
meaningful and generally comparable to the observed ORR in the overall PAS. In addition, 3 patients 
had a best response of stable disease (SD). 
The claim of a better safety profile of pirtobrutinib over brexu-cel is difficult to conclude on based on 
immature data from a phase 1/2 study with a new product with limited follow-up, and without a head-
to-head comparison. Nevertheless, the observation that 46.2% of the MCL patients who progressed 
after prior CAR-T cell therapy responded to pirtobrutinib in study 18001 may be considered a clinically 
relevant advantage if the patients who responded in the pooled population had received brexu-cel as 
prior CAR-T cell therapy and the responses in these patients were durable. No information on the pre-
treatment history of those patients who had progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with brexu-
cel before study entry in the pivotal study and their response data to pirtobrutinib has been provided, 
to further substantiate the claim of a significant benefit as compared to brexu-cel for patients with r/r 
MCL in the post-BTK inhibitor setting. Moreover, no indirect comparison of the efficacy outcomes of 
pirtobrutinib compared to brexu-cel has been provided to establish a clinically relevant advantage or a 
major contribution to patient care. 
The argument that pirtobrutinib will confer a benefit to patients with r/r MCL who are unable or unfit to 
receive the approved CAR-T cell product due to selected eligibility criteria has not been sufficiently 
substantiated with relevant data. Efficacy data for pirtobrutinib from the subset of patients in the 
pivotal study 18001 who would be considered ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy, specifically brexu-cel, 
may be relevant for the COMP to evaluate such a claim. 
Overall, the claim of significant benefit for pirtobrutinib over the satisfactory methods of treatment 
lenalidomide (Revlimid and generics), temsirolimus (Torisel), and brexu-cel (Tecartus) in patients with 
r/r MCL after failure with a BTK inhibitor was not considered established by the COMP based on the 
data provided. A list of questions on significant benefit has been adopted by the COMP. 
4.  COMP list of issues 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor is invited to detail the pre-treatment history and present an efficacy analysis for 
pirtobrutinib in relevant subgroups of patients from the pivotal study who had progressed or relapsed 
after prior treatment with each of the authorised satisfactory methods, specifically lenalidomide, 
temsirolimus, and brexucabtagene autoleucel. 
In addition, a methodologically sound indirect comparison to the authorised satisfactory methods 
should be provided to establish a clinically relevant advantage or a major contribution to patient care. 
Furthermore, efficacy data should be provided to support the argument that pirtobrutinib will confer a 
benefit to patients who would be considered ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy.

Comments on sponsor’s response to the COMP list of issues 
The sponsor further justified the claim of significant benefit for pirtobrutinib over the satisfactory 
methods lenalidomide, temsirolimus, and brexu-cel for the target MCL population in the post-BTK 
inhibitor setting based on efficacy data from the latest DCO of the pivotal study 18001 as requested. 
Efficacy in patients previously treated with lenalidomide, temsirolimus, and brexu-cel 
The sponsor presented the pre-treatment history and efficacy analyses of enrolled patients treated 
with pirtobrutinib in the pivotal study who have progressed or relapsed after previous therapy with 
lenalidomide, temsirolimus, or brexu-cel using the latest DCO date of 29-Jul-2022 (Table 2).

The analyses in the two supportive supplemental analysis sets (SAS1 and SAS2) were defined to 
investigate MCL patients pre-treated with covalent BTK inhibitor with either shorter follow-up time 
compared to the PAS (SAS1; N=48) or for those who did not meet the PAS criteria (such as CNS 
involvement and non-measurable disease at baseline; SAS2; N=14). While not part of the primary 
population, these SASs are supportive in the assessment of the benefit and increase the number of 
assessable patients who may have received one of the authorised satisfactory methods.

The 19 patients from the PAS who had previously been treated with lenalidomide, had received a 
median number of 5 (range: 2-8) prior lines of therapy and a median number of 1 (range: 1-3) prior 
lines of BTK inhibitors. The ORR by IRC assessment for patients in the PAS who had already received 
lenalidomide was 68.4% (95% CI: 43.4, 87.4), which was numerically higher than that reported for 
the overall population (56.7%; 95% CI: 45.8, 67.1). The median DOR among the responders was 25.3 
months (95% CI: 6.47, NE), which was also longer than that observed in the full PAS (17.6 months; 
95% CI: 7.3, 27.2). The sponsor noted there is uncertainty in the point estimates for DOR and minor 
data changes can be influential due to the limited number of responders, as shown by wide 95% CIs. 
Among the 152 patients with MCL who were pre-treated with a BTK inhibitor in study 18001, only two 
patients had received prior treatment with temsirolimus. Both patients were in the PAS and responded 
to pirtobrutinib treatment. One patient received 6 lines of prior therapy including acalabrutinib and had 
a BOR of CR when treated with pirtobrutinib, which lasted for 17.7 months. The other patient received 
7 lines of prior therapy including ibrutinib and obtained a PR when treated with pirtobrutinib that lasted 
for 7.3 months. The sponsor emphasised that the limited number of patients with prior treatment with 
temsirolimus reflects the limited use of this intravenously administered treatment option in clinical 
practice, which is largely due to tolerability issues, limited efficacy, and decrements to quality of life 
(Hess et al., 2017; Rule et al., 2018). 
Among the 13 patients who received prior CAR-T cell therapy in study 18001, 7 of them specifically 
received brexu-cel, and none of these patients were in the PAS. One patient who received brexu-cel 
had also previously received a CAR-natural killer cell product. Of the remaining 6 patients, 2 patients 
had received an unknown CAR-T cell product type, 2 patients had prior axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-
cel), and other 2 patients had lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel). The 13 patients who had already 
received CAR-T cell treatment had received a median number of 5 (range: 4-8) prior lines of therapy 
and a median number of 1 (range: 1-3) prior lines of BTK inhibitors. Efficacy data for the 7 patients 
who received brexu-cel are listed in Table 3. Three of the patients (42.9%) who had previously been 
treated with brexu-cel achieved a response (2 CR, 1 PR). The two patients who achieved a CR were 
still in response at 9.4 and 5.5 months from date of first response. The patient who achieved a PR to 
pirtobrutinib subsequently died 3.2 months from date of first response.

censored observation 
The COMP was of the opinion that due to the limited patient numbers in the subgroup of patients 
previously treated with brexu-cel or temsirolimus, a conclusion on a clinically meaningful benefit could

Page 13/33 
 
 
 
 
 
only be derived in the subgroup of patients who have progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with 
lenalidomide for adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who have been 
previously treated with a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  
In particular, the COMP pointed out that the efficacy data with Jaypirca in individual patients who have 
progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with brexu-cel before study entry were considered 
inconclusive in view of the low number of patients in this subset who responded to Jaypirca and the 
limited follow-up time in these patients, so that the clinical relevance of the responses observed could 
not be established.    
Relative efficacy of pirtobrutinib versus lenalidomide, temsirolimus, and brexu-cel 
The sponsor has conducted, as requested, indirect comparisons on the clinical benefit of pirtobrutinib 
compared to lenalidomide, temsirolimus, and brexu-cel based on a naïve (unadjusted) side-by-side 
comparison versus results from the registration studies. To further supplement this approach and 
investigate the benefit of pirtobrutinib in the post-BTK inhibitor population, methodologically sound 
adjusted comparative analyses were conducted of patients in study 18001 versus patient-level real-
world data from the ConcertAI database and versus published data from SCHOLAR-2 (Hess G et al., 
2022). However, the COMP is of the opinion that the real-world analyses are not considered relevant 
for evaluating significant benefit for pirtobrutinib in MCL because patients that had received CAR-T cell 
therapy were excluded and the outcome data for the individual therapies of lenalidomide and 
temsirolimus were insufficient to perform separate therapy-specific subgroup analyses. 
The sponsor underscored that the pivotal studies for lenalidomide and temsirolimus reflected a 
different target patient population than that enrolled in study 18001 as they were conducted prior to 
the availability of covalent BTK inhibitors and had considerable differences in the studies regarding the 
outcome assessment (the pivotal study for temsirolimus utilized RECIST criteria from solid tumours to 
assess response/progression, whereas the others utilized hematologic criteria). “Unanchored” indirect 
comparisons to these products were thus not considered feasible to conduct since an assumption that 
all effect modifiers and prognostic factors could be accounted for was impossible to meet, and failure of 
this assumption would lead to an unknown amount of bias in the estimate (Phillippo et al., 2016). 
In addition to the registration studies for lenalidomide and temsirolimus, a literature search and review 
of published studies in the MCL post-covalent BTK inhibitor setting was conducted. Five studies were 
identified for lenalidomide and no studies for temsirolimus. The feasibility assessment determined that 
none of the studies provided sufficient data for naïve side-by-side comparisons, unadjusted analyses, 
or adjusted comparative analyses given the small sample sizes of the three studies reporting outcomes 
related to lenalidomide (n=3, n=6, and n=30, respectively) and that no outcome data were reported 
specific to lenalidomide in the two remaining studies. 
A summary of the registration studies and efficacy results for lenalidomide, temsirolimus, and brexu-
cel for r/r MCL patients alongside that for the pivotal study for pirtobrutinib is presented in Table 4 and 
Table 5. Overall, these studies are relatively similar in terms of selected patient baseline characteristics 
(for example, sex and age) and were all conducted in the setting of r/r MCL. However, as noted above 
the temsirolimus and lenalidomide studies were quite different in several important aspects.

Based on the naïve comparison both lenalidomide and temsirolimus have substantially lower ORR and 
overall lower DOR reported in their registrational studies in a covalent BTK inhibitor naïve population 
than that observed with pirtobrutinib in the post-covalent BTK inhibitor setting. The reported ORR for 
pirtobrutinib was 56.7% (95% CI: 45.8, 67.1) and its lower bound of 45.8% far exceeded not only the 
point estimate, but even the upper bound of the confidence intervals for ORR for temsirolimus (ORR 
22.2% [95% CI: 11.1, 33.3]) or lenalidomide (ORR 28% [95% CI: 20, 36]), highlighting the strength 
and confidence in efficacy of pirtobrutinib compared to these therapies. From the naïve comparison, 
CAR-T cell therapy demonstrated superior efficacy in terms of ORR and durability to that observed for 
pirtobrutinib, which was expected, and a further matched comparison was therefore not pursued.

The COMP was of the opinion that the clinical study data (descriptive side-by-side comparison) showed 
improved efficacy of Jaypirca, with sustained overall responses, as compared to lenalidomide and 
temsirolimus but suggested inferior efficacy of Jaypirca in comparison to Tecartus. 
Efficacy of pirtobrutinib in subset of patients who would be ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy 
To evaluate the efficacy of pirtobrutinib in patients that would be considered ineligible for CAR-T cell 
therapy, the sponsor compared the eligibility criteria and available baseline characteristic data of 
patients enrolled in the registration study ZUMA-2 for brexu-cel versus those enrolled in study 18001. 
Based on this assessment, the criteria outlined in Table 6 were used to identify patients potentially 
ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy among MCL patients pre-treated with a BTK inhibitor in study 18001. 
The sponsor stressed that the ineligibility criteria used were expected guides and ultimately whether a 
patient would be selected in the real world setting for CAR-T cell therapy would depend on the overall 
benefit-risk assessment made by the treating healthcare professional (HCP).

be likely ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy at the time on enrolment into study 18001, with 16 patients 
specifically from the PAS. A summary of pirtobrutinib efficacy for these patients are given in Table 7. 
Patients enrolled in study 18001 who would be considered ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy across all 
analysis sets had received a median number of 4 (range: 1-8) prior lines of therapy and a median 
number of 1 (range: 1-3) prior lines of BTK inhibitors. This subgroup thus appeared to have similar 
prior treatment history and obtained similar benefit as the overall MCL population pre-treated with a 
BTK inhibitor. The sponsor pointed out that the potential CAR-T cell ineligible population from study 
18001 constitute a significant proportion of patients enrolled in the study, representing over 25% of 
the overall MCL population which was pre-treated with a BTK inhibitor. According to the sponsor, this is 
likely an underestimate of the true proportion of patients in clinical practice that would be ineligible for

CAR-T cell therapy but would still be appropriate for pirtobrutinib. Furthermore, retrospective analyses 
support a higher proportion with 35-58% of patients being considered ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy 
(Smith et al., 2019; Puckrin et al., 2022).

Overall, the sponsor has provided supplementary data as requested to further substantiate the claim of 
significant benefit for pirtobrutinib over the satisfactory methods lenalidomide, temsirolimus, and 
brexu-cel for the target MCL population in the post-BTK inhibitor setting. 
The efficacy analyses in the subsets of patients in the pivotal study 18001 who had previously received 
lenalidomide, temsirolimus, or brexu-cel before study entry showed that pirtobrutinib offered a benefit 
for patients who had previously been treated with lenalidomide as those patients in the PAS who had 
progressed following this therapy achieved an ORR of 68.4% (13/19; 95% CI: 43.4, 87.4), which was 
numerically higher than that reported for the overall PAS population (56.7%; 95% CI: 45.8, 67.1). The 
median DOR among the responders previously treated with lenalidomide was 25.3 months (95% CI: 
6.47, NE), which was also somewhat longer than that observed in the full PAS (17.6 months; 95% CI: 
7.3, 27.2). The responses observed in the subgroup of patients who had failed prior treatment with 
lenalidomide is hence considered to constitute a clinically relevant advantage for patients with r/r MCL 
in the post-BTK inhibitor setting although data on the time-dependent endpoints were immature. 
The anti-tumour responses observed in patients who had previously been treated with temsirolimus 
(n=2) or brexu-cel (n=7) could in principle also be considered to constitute a clinically relevant 
advantage for patients with r/r MCL. However, the numbers of patients recorded to have been exposed 
to these two products prior to enrolment in the pivotal study for pirtobrutinib were very limited and the 
data also immature. In addition, only three of the patients (3/7; 42.9%) who had previously been 
treated with brexu-cel were reported to have achieved a response to pirtobrutinib. The two patients 
who achieved a CR were still in response at 5.5 and 9.4 months from date of first response, while the

patient who obtained a PR subsequently died 3.2 months from date of first response. Both patients 
who had received prior treatment with temsirolimus in the PAS responded to pirtobrutinib. One of the 
two patients had received prior acalabrutinib and obtained a CR when treated with pirtobrutinib, which 
lasted for 17.7 months, whereas the other patient had previously been treated with ibrutinib and 
obtained a PR to pirtobrutinib that lasted for 7.3 months. 
The justification provided by the sponsor as to why "unanchored" indirect comparisons of the clinical 
benefit of pirtobrutinib compared to lenalidomide, temsirolimus, and brexu-cel were not considered 
feasible are endorsed. The sponsor has therefore conducted indirect comparisons to these products 
based on a descriptive (unadjusted) side-by-side comparison versus results from the registration 
studies. The efficacy outcomes reported in the naive comparison indicated that more r/r MCL patients 
in study 18001 achieved a sustained ORR to pirtobrutinib in the post-covalent BTK inhibitor setting 
compared to those treated with lenalidomide or temsirolimus in a covalent BTK inhibitor naïve setting. 
Specifically, the ORR for pirtobrutinib in study 18001 was >2 times higher than that reported for both 
temsirolimus and lenalidomide in OPTIMAL and EMERGE (56.7% vs. 22.2% and 28%, respectively). In 
addition, the lower bound of the 95% CI for ORR of 45.8% far exceeded not only the point estimate, 
but even the upper bound of the CIs for temsirolimus (95% CI: 11.1, 33.3) and lenalidomide (95% CI: 
20, 36). As expected, brexu-cel showed superior efficacy in terms of ORR (84% vs. 56.7%) and 
durability (median DOR: 28.2 months vs. 17.6 months) to that observed for pirtobrutinib in study 
18001, and matched comparison was therefore not pursued. 
The descriptive indirect side-by-side comparison of results from the pivotal studies for temsirolimus 
and lenalidomide versus that for pirtobrutinib provided adequate evidence to support the claim of a 
clinically relevant advantage of pirtobrutinib based on improved efficacy in terms of higher and 
sustained ORR compared to that obtained with temsirolimus and lenalidomide in r/r MCL patients. 
The efficacy results from the analyses conducted in the subset of patients who would be considered 
ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy based on eligibility criteria and available baseline characteristic data 
from patients enrolled in the comparator study ZUMA-2 for brexu-cel versus the pivotal study 18001 
for pirtobrutinib were not taken into consideration because none of the sponsor-defined ineligibility 
criteria are reflected in the therapeutic indication wording or are contraindications for the treatment 
with Tecartus. Furthermore, there are currently no published consensus guidelines defining specific 
(in)eligibility criteria for CAR-T cell therapy. 
The COMP did not consider the efficacy results with Jaypirca from this subgroup analysis in selected 
patients deemed potentially ineligible for treatment with Tecartus as none of the sponsor-defined 
ineligibility criteria are reflected in the therapeutic indication wording of Tecartus and none of these 
ineligibility criteria are contraindications for the treatment with Tecartus. Furthermore, there are 
currently no published consensus guidelines defining specific (in)eligibility criteria for CAR-T cell 
therapy. 
COMP conclusion 
The claim of significant benefit for pirtobrutinib compared to lenalidomide and temsirolimus for the 
target MCL population in the post-BTK inhibitor setting can be considered established based on the 
data provided. However, the sponsor failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate significant 
benefit for pirtobrutinib over brexu-cel (Tecartus). The data provided are consequently not considered 
satisfactory to support the maintenance of the orphan designation.

5.  COMP position adopted on 17 May 2023 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated orphan medicinal product; 
the prevalence of mantle cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated 
to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.6 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening with a median survival of 3 to 5 years and chronically debilitating 
due to lymphadenopathy, night sweats, fever, fatigue, and weight loss in the untreated state; 
the sponsor’s claim that pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca) is of significant benefit to those affected by the 
orphan condition does not hold since the sponsor could only establish the existence of a clinically 
relevant advantage over two of the authorised satisfactory methods of treatment, specifically 
lenalidomide (Revlimid and generics) and temsirolimus (Torisel), but not over the third authorised 
satisfactory method brexucabtagene autololeucel (Tecartus). 
-  Clinical study data showed improved and sustained overall responses with Jaypirca as 
compared to lenalidomide and temsirolimus and a clinically meaningful benefit in a 
subgroup of patients who have progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with 
lenalidomide for adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who have 
been previously treated with a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  
-  A descriptive side-by-side comparison of the efficacy outcomes from the pivotal studies for 
Jaypirca and Tecartus suggested inferior efficacy of Jaypirca in comparison to Tecartus. 
- 
The efficacy data with Jaypirca in individual patients who have progressed or relapsed after 
prior treatment with Tecartus before study entry were considered inconclusive in view of 
the low number of patients in this subset who responded to Jaypirca and the limited follow-
up time in these patients, so that the clinical relevance of the responses observed could 
not be established.    
- 
The efficacy results with Jaypirca from the subgroup analysis in selected patients 
considered potentially ineligible for treatment with Tecartus were not taken into 
consideration because a) none of the sponsor-defined ineligibility criteria are reflected in 
the therapeutic indication wording of Tecartus and b) none of these ineligibility criteria are 
contraindications for the treatment with Tecartus. Furthermore, there are currently no 
published consensus guidelines defining specific (in)eligibility criteria for CAR-T cell 
therapy. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are not satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Jaypirca, (S)-5-amino-3-(4-((5-
fluoro-2-methoxybenzamido)methyl)phenyl)-1-(1,1,1-trifluoropropane-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-
carboxamide, pirtobrutinib for treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (EU/3/21/2450) is removed from the 
Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

6.  Appeal to the negative opinion adopted on 17 May 2023 
Grounds for appeal 
The sponsor presented detailed grounds for appeal on 15 August 2023.  
Please refer to the sponsor’s appeal documents in the case Input from Industry folder. 
Ground 1. Pirtobrutinib offers a significant therapeutic benefit by offering a clinically relevant 
advantage to patients who are ineligible for brexucabtagene autololeucel or who have progressed after 
receiving brexucabtagene autololeucel 
According to the sponsor, based upon the CHMP-endorsed indication of pirtobrutinib, a patient with 
relapsed or refractory MCL is eligible for treatment with pirtobrutinib if previously treated with a BTKi. 
Thus, pirtobrutinib offers a treatment for those patients that received a BTKi in the first line. In 
contrast, brexucabtagene autololeucel is not available in the second line, as it is only authorised for 
those patients who have received at least 2 lines of prior therapy. According to the sponsor, 
pirtobrutinib will be authorised for the subset of patients that received brexucabtagene autololeucel 
and progressed; therefore, this represents a patient population with a significant unmet medical need 
where no realistic treatment options remain.  
Thus, pirtobrutinib offers a clinically relevant advantage in at least 2 specific subsets of patients with 
MCL, namely patients:  
1.  treated in the first line with a BTKi and requiring further treatment, and  
2.  patients previously treated with a BTKi and brexucabtagene autololeucel and who have 
subsequently progressed. 
The sponsor concludes on a line independent anti-MCL activity and provided updated overall response 
rate and duration of response by number of prior lines of therapy primary analysis set (Table 8).

Ground 2: Pirtobrutinib delivers significant therapeutic benefit by offering a major contribution to 
patient care  
The sponsor argued that pirtobrutinib offers an alternate efficacy and superior safety profile to 
brexucabtagene autololeucel that reflects a similar benefit-risk profile to brexucabtagene autololeucel. 
In significant contrast to brexucabtagene autololeucel, pirtobrutinib offers an oral, non-hospital self-
administered treatment that can be initiated immediately upon diagnosis. Pirtobrutinib, through ease 
of oral administration, provides a major contribution to the care of patients with MCL that cannot be 
addressed by brexucabtagene autololeucel.  
Regarding the claim on alternate efficacy, the sponsor argued on the durability of PR induced by 
pirtobrutinib (ORR 56.7%, CR 18.9%; 37.8 PR) which contrasts to a very short duration of partial 
response induced by brexucabtagene autololeucel (ORR was 91%, including 68% of patients with an 
observed CR and 24% with an observed PR) which is also associated with prolonged survival. There is 
also a scientific rationale for the difference of the prognosis of a partial response for an immune-
mediated treatment (non-recognised clones continue to grow) vs a signalling interfering agent (not 
sufficient to eliminate bulk tumour).

7.  Scientific Advisory Group consultation of 30 August 2023 
1.  The SAG is invited to comment on the following grounds for negative opinion on the 
orphan medicinal product designation: 
−  A descriptive side-by-side comparison of the efficacy outcomes from the pivotal 
studies for Jaypirca and Tecartus suggested inferior efficacy of Jaypirca in 
comparison to Tecartus. 
Both trials are small non-randomized controlled trials, and any conclusions are difficult from such 
indirect comparison. In particular, it is difficult to ascertain whether the populations are comparable. 
Furthermore, patient selection and delays prior to CAR-T treatment start may favor CAR-T group in 
indirect comparisons from start of treatment due to the long lead time to receive treatment. Thus, the 
apparent suggested inferior efficacy cannot be confirmed.  
The suggested inferior efficacy of Jaypirca in comparison to Tecartus remains an interesting clinical 
question that is open and warrants further investigation.  
On a different note, CAR-T treatment is a good option with frequent long remissions in patients with 
mantle-cell lymphoma who are eligible for treatment, but the treatment is complex and severe toxicity 
is frequent. About 40% to 50% are not eligible for CAR-T therapy mainly due to disease and patient 
characteristics based on current practice (see below). There is currently an unmet medical need in this 
population as there are few established options with limited activity. 
−  The efficacy data with Jaypirca in individual patients who have progressed or 
relapsed after prior treatment with Tecartus before study entry were considered 
inconclusive in view of the low number of patients in this subset who responded to 
Jaypirca and the limited follow-up time in these patients, so that the clinical 
relevance of the responses observed could not be established (data cut-off July 
2022).    
The SAG agreed that it is difficult to draw strong conclusions about the objective response rate in the 
data in patients whose disease progressed after CAR-T therapy, due to the small data set. However, 
responses were observed, and the results should be confirmed in a larger data set with sufficient 
follow-up to assess duration of response.  
−  The efficacy results with Jaypirca from the subgroup analysis in selected patients 
considered potentially ineligible for treatment with Tecartus were not taken into 
consideration because a) none of the sponsor-defined ineligibility criteria are 
reflected in the therapeutic indication wording of Tecartus and b) none of these 
ineligibility criteria are contraindications for the treatment with Tecartus. 
Furthermore, there are currently no published consensus guidelines defining specific 
(in)eligibility criteria for CAR-T cell therapy. 
The SAG considered that there is a clear unmet medical need in the population of patients that are not 
eligible for CAR-T therapy, and that the activity of Jaypirca consisting of high durable objective 
response rate in patients not eligible for CAR-T therapy is of high clinical importance given the limited 
available options. 
•  The population of patients with mainly rapid progression, important co-morbidities, older age 
(>80), is currently not indicated for CAR-T treatment and corresponds to about 40%-50% of 
patients based on current practice, despite these options being available. Although published 
international guidelines are currently lacking, there is a wide consensus based on expert opinion 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000124200 
Page 27/33 
 
 
 
 
 
and published series, fully acknowledging that the field of optimising CAR-T treatment continues to 
progress. 
•  Available alternative treatment options that are established consist of lenalidomide and 
temsirolimus and the activity is considered to be less than 20%-25% objective response rate.  
•  The available data for Jaypirca (study 18001) indicate a much higher activity in terms of durable 
objective response rate (ORR: 56.7%; median duration of response: 17.6 months), compared to 
available established options.  
•  The activity has been observed consistently across different subgroups and it is reasonable to 
assume it will apply to the population of patients not eligible for CAR-T therapy. The activity is of 
such magnitude that it is likely that it will translate in a favourable effect in terms of clinical 
endpoints such as progression-free survival, health-related quality of life (QOL), and possibly 
overall survival. QOL data presented at the meeting looked promising in this respect. 
•  The safety profile is considered acceptable in this setting, where patients ineligible for CAR-T 
therapy may be of older age and have multiple co-morbidities, not to mention the convenience of 
oral treatment.  
• 
In summary, Jaypirca is a clinically important therapeutic option in patients not eligible for CAR-T 
therapy, and the benefits of Jaypirca against available treatment are high activity, oral 
administration, and acceptable toxicity. Given the magnitude of effects, the differences compared to 
available established treatments are clear. 
2.  Are there patients who are refractory to or relapse after Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) 
treatment that would not be eligible to be treated with conditioning and Tecartus in 
clinical practice, despite these options being available? Please describe the extent and 
characteristics of such patient population. Please also describe the benefits of 
pirtobrutinib against available treatment options in this population, also taking into 
account the toxicity profile of other treatment options and the impact of partial response 
on overall outcome. 
The SAG considered that there is a clear unmet medical need in the population of patients that are not 
eligible for CAR-T therapy, and that the activity of Jaypirca consisting of high durable objective 
responses in patients not eligible for CAR-T therapy is of high clinical importance given the current 
limited use of CAR-T therapy (see answer to the previous question).

8.  Comments on the grounds of appeal 
COMP position on Ground #1   
The COMP took note of the sponsor’s argument that Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib) is intended to treat adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have previously been 
treated with a BTK inhibitor. Ibrutinib is the only BTK inhibitor which is authorised in the EU for the 
treatment of MCL patients; it should be noted that ibrutinib is authorised in the EU only in the r/r 
setting. This means that no BTK inhibitor (including ibrutinib) is authorised in the EU for use as first-
line treatment in MCL patients.  
In view of the fact that treatment for MCL patients with a BTK inhibitor is authorised in the EU as a 
second line treatment, and in view of the fact that Jaypirca is authorised in the EU for use after (failed) 
treatment with a BTK inhibitor, this would qualify Jaypirca as a third line treatment for MCL patients.  
For completeness, Tecartus is also authorised in the EU as a third line treatment for MCL patients.  
On balance, Jaypirca and Tecartus are authorised in the EU for the same line of treatment in patients 
with MCL.  
Further to the above, the sponsor’s claim that the r/r MCL population after first line BTK treatment may 
only benefit from Jaypirca, and not from Tecartus, is not valid from a regulatory perspective; and 
should therefore be rejected. 
In addition, the sponsor claimed that Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib) is intended to treat adult patients who 
have progressed after previous treatment with a BTK inhibitor and Tecartus. In connection to this 
claim, the COMP assessed all data submitted by the sponsor, including the data after the adoption of 
the opinion of 17 April 2023 (namely, including data with a cut-off point of 5 May 2023).  
The COMP maintained its position that efficacy of Jaypirca could not be established in the subgroup of 
patients who have progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with Tecartus due to the very limited 
number of studied patients (7 patients were followed; with only 2 of them having complete responses). 
The duration of the responses was prolonged by 9 months with the new data cut-off point, but the 
clinical relevance of the limited responses in this small subgroup remains unclear. In this respect, the 
COMP agrees with the SAG conclusion ‘‘that it is difficult to draw strong conclusions about the objective 
response rate in the data in patients whose disease progressed after CAR-T therapy, due to the small 
data set. However, responses were observed, and the results should be confirmed in a larger data set 
with sufficient follow-up to assess duration of response’’. 
On balance, COMP maintains its position that there is no conclusive evidence of a clinically relevant 
advantage of Jaypirca over Tecartus in the subset of patients that have progressed after treatment 
with Tecartus due to the limited responses of this small subset of patients.   
In relation to the first ground of appeal, the COMP considers that the presented data is not sufficient to 
establish that Jaypirca offers a clinically relevant advantage in the following two specific subsets: 1) in 
adult patients with r/r MCL who have previously been treated with a BTK inhibitor in the first line 
setting; and 2) in patients that are r/r to Tecartus. 
COMP position on Ground #2   
Under the second ground of appeal, the sponsor essentially claims that Jaypirca offers an alternate 
efficacy and superior safety profile to that of Tecartus that ultimately results in a similar risk-benefit 
balance. On the basis of that claim, the sponsor proceeds to claim that Jaypirca should qualify as a 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000124200 
Page 29/33 
 
 
 
 
 
major contribution to patient care on that basis that Jaypirca “offers an oral, non-hospital self-
administered treatment that can be initiated immediately upon diagnosis”.  
Regarding the claim of an alternate efficacy profile, the COMP agreed with the SAG that ‘‘available 
alternative treatment options that are established consist of lenalidomide and temsirolimus and the 
activity is considered to be less than 20%-25% objective response rate. The available data for Jaypirca 
(BRUIN study) indicate a much higher activity in terms of durable objective response rate (ORR: 
56.7%; median duration of response: 17.6 months), compared to available established options’’. 
However, in the most recent update of ZUMA-2 (Wang et al. 2023), among all the patients who 
received Tecartus (n = 68), the ORR was 91% with a median duration of response of 28.2 months. The 
secondary endpoint, duration of response, is also considered of importance, in order to confirm the 
clinical benefit of a response rate.  
The COMP took note of the sponsor’s argument regarding the difference between Jaypirca and Tecartus 
in terms of partial responses (37.8% versus 24% respectively) and the impact of partial responses on 
PFS and OS. However, the COMP considered the primary efficacy endpoint of overall response rate (for 
the studies submitted for both Tecartus and Jaypirca) as the most relevant and highlighted the 
considerable difference between Jaypirca and Tecartus in that respect (56.7% versus 91%, 
respectively). This difference was driven by the much higher proportion of patients on Tecartus with 
complete responses (68% versus 18.9 % in Tecartus and Jaypirca, respectively). The single arm 
design of the pivotal studies and the lack of a comparator leads in uncertainties especially in relation to 
interpretation of time to event endpoints such as PFS and OS.  
The sponsor also provided MAIC analyses on OS. However, the effective sample size after weighting is 
44.2 (approximately 50%). In addition, the 95% CIs of the hazard ratios from the MAIC analysis 
comparing pirtobrutinib to brexucabtagene autololeucel did not demonstrate a statistically significant 
difference; the hazard ratios and 95% CIs are 1.29 (0.809, 2.057) for the unweighted pirtobrutinib 
group and 1.35 (0.777, 2.340) for the weighted pirtobrutinib group.  
Regarding the claim of a superior safety profile of Jaypirca over Tecartus, this cannot be established 
due to the limitations of the submitted data. In particular, the submitted data comes from a small 
single-arm study, with limited follow-up, and cannot substantiate in any conclusive way the claimed 
better safety of Jaypirca over Tecartus, also in view of the major difference in their respective 
treatment schedules (continuous vs unique administration). 
During the SAG meeting and at the oral explanation, the sponsor argued that Jaypirca will address an 
unmet medical need in patients with rapid disease progression as it is an “off-the-shelf” medicinal 
product for immediate administration. The COMP took note of these arguments but highlighted that 
there are no specific criteria at present which would allow to predefine a specific patient population not 
benefiting from CAR-T cell therapy but benefitting instead from Jaypirca; and that choice of treatment 
is at the individual discretion of the treating physician. In addition, as it is mentioned above, the 
efficacy of Jaypirca in patients with rapid disease progression and/or who cannot receive CAR-T cell 
therapy has not been demonstrated. 
The responder analysis also showed that early progression occurred in the BRUIN study in a relevant 
subgroup of patients. 
The sponsor was asked to provide more data on patients with rapidly progressing disease in their 
pivotal trial; however, this data was not presented before and during the oral explanation at the COMP. 
Currently, no robust data on the efficacy of Jaypirca as bridging therapy to CAR-T or allogeneic SCT are 
available. In addition, it is not known whether the activity of Jaypirca as observed in the phase 1/2 trial 
(including the durable responses in 2 patients failing CAR-T therapy) can be extrapolated to the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000124200 
Page 30/33 
 
 
 
 
 
subgroup of patients considered ineligible for CAR-T treatment either due to unfavourable baseline or 
disease characteristics.   
The COMP agreed with the SAG that ‘‘the activity has been observed consistently across different 
subgroups and it is reasonable to assume it will apply to the population of patients not eligible for CAR-
T therapy’’. However, this argument cannot be taken into consideration as none of the factors 
identified to representing ineligibility for CAR-T cell therapy are contraindications for this class of 
products and, as also recognised by the sponsor and the SAG, that eligibility criteria for CAR-Ts 
therapy are still developing and published international guidelines are currently lacking.  
During the SAG and at the oral explanation, the sponsor also provided an analysis of QoL data in MCL 
patients in which QoL appears to have been maintained over time. The COMP agreed with the SAG that 
‘‘the data looked promising’’ but highlighted the limitations of an unblinded assessment in a single-arm 
study.  
However, it should be recalled that a claim of major contribution to patient care may only be assessed 
once the equivalence of the candidate orphan product and the authorised product under comparison 
has been established in terms of efficacy, safety and benefit/risk balance. To that effect, reference is 
made to the “Commission notice on the application of Articles 3, 5 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 on orphan medicinal products” (available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:JOC 2016 424 R 0003&from=EN).    
On balance, the COMP considers that the presented data is insufficient to establish that Jaypirca has 
equivalent efficacy (and risk-benefit balance) when compared with Tecartus. In the absence of such 
demonstration, it is not possible to accept a claim of major contribution to patient care.  
Based on the above, and after taking note of the SAG advice, the COMP considered that for the 
purpose of the European orphan designation, the arguments presented were not sufficient to establish 
the existence of a significant benefit of Jaypirca over Tecartus. 
In relation to the first and second grounds of appeal, the COMP considers that the presented data is 
not sufficiently robust to conclude that Jaypirca provides a clinically relevant advantage or a major 
contribution to patient care for any (subsets of) r/r MCL patients vis-à-vis the authorised CAR-T cell 
product Tecartus.

9.  COMP final position on review of criteria for orphan 
designation adopted on 7 September 2023 
Based on the assessment of the detailed grounds for appeal and the argumentations presented by the 
sponsor during the oral explanation, the COMP concluded that: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated orphan medicinal product; 
the prevalence of mantle cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated 
to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.6 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening with a median survival of 3 to 5 years and chronically debilitating 
due to lymphadenopathy, night sweats, fever, fatigue, and weight loss in the untreated state; 
in the context of the first opinion, the COMP concluded that the data the sponsor’s claim that 
pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca) is of significant benefit to those affected by the orphan condition does not 
hold since the sponsor could only establish the existence of a clinically relevant advantage over two 
of the authorised satisfactory methods of treatment, specifically lenalidomide (Revlimid and 
generics) and temsirolimus (Torisel), but not over the third authorised satisfactory method 
brexucabtagene autololeucel (Tecartus). 
Clinical study data showed improved and sustained overall responses with Jaypirca as compared to 
lenalidomide and temsirolimus and a clinically meaningful benefit in a subgroup of patients who 
have progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with lenalidomide for adult patients with relapsed 
or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who have been previously treated with a Bruton’s tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor.  
-   A descriptive side-by-side comparison of the efficacy outcomes from the pivotal studies for 
Jaypirca and Tecartus suggested inferior efficacy of Jaypirca in comparison to Tecartus. 
-   The efficacy data with Jaypirca in individual patients who have progressed or relapsed after prior 
treatment with Tecartus before study entry were considered inconclusive in view of the low 
number of patients in this subset who responded to Jaypirca and the limited follow-up time in 
these patients, so that the clinical relevance of the responses observed could not be established.    
-   The efficacy results with Jaypirca from the subgroup analysis in selected patients considered 
potentially ineligible for treatment with Tecartus were not taken into consideration because a) 
none of the sponsor-defined ineligibility criteria are reflected in the therapeutic indication 
wording of Tecartus and b) none of these ineligibility criteria are contraindications for the 
treatment with Tecartus. Furthermore, there are currently no published consensus guidelines 
defining specific (in)eligibility criteria for CAR-T cell therapy. 
• 
In the context of the appeal, the sponsor presented evidence and arguments to the COMP to 
substantiate the claim of the existence of significant benefit of Jaypirca over Tecartus. The appeal 
comprises two grounds. Under the first ground of appeal, the sponsor claims that Jaypirca offers a 
clinically relevant advantage to patients who are ineligible for Tecartus or who have progressed 
after receiving Tecartus. Under the second ground of appeal, the sponsor claims that Jaypirca 
qualifies as a major contribution to patient care in view of its ease of administration. 
• 
In relation to the first ground of appeal, the COMP considers that the presented data remains 
insufficient to establish that Jaypirca offers a clinically relevant advantage over Tecartus. In 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000124200 
Page 32/33 
 
 
 
 
 
particular, the sponsor’s claim that the population who failed after first line ibrutinib treatment may 
only benefit from Jaypirca and not from Tecartus, which is specifically authorised in more than 2 
prior lines of treatments, is not valid from a regulatory perspective as ibrutinib is currently 
authorised as second line treatment. In addition, the COMP maintained its position that the efficacy 
data with Jaypirca in individual patients who have progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with 
Tecartus before study entry were considered inconclusive in view of the limited number of patients 
who responded to Jaypirca. 
• 
In relation to the second ground of appeal, the COMP considers that the presented data is 
insufficient to establish that Jaypirca has equivalent efficacy (and risk-benefit balance) when 
compared with Tecartus. In the absence of such demonstration, it is not possible to accept a claim 
of major contribution to patient care.  
Therefore, the sponsor has not established that Jaypirca is of significant benefit to those affected by 
the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the detailed grounds for appeal submitted by the sponsor and all the 
supporting data on the basis of Article 5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are not satisfied. 
The COMP recommends that Jaypirca, (S)-5-amino-3-(4-((5-fluoro-2-
methoxybenzamido)methyl)phenyl)-1-(1,1,1-trifluoropropane-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide, 
pirtobrutinib for treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (EU/3/21/2450) is removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

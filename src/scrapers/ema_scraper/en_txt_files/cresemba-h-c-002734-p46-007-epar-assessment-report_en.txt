1.  Introduction 
On 26 May 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (Study 9766-CL-0107) for 
Cresemba (isavuconazonium sulfate), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, 
as amended.  
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s) P46. The study is part of 
the agreed paediatric investigation plan EMEA-001301-PIP02-12-M04. A short critical expert overview 
(4 pages, dated 17-05-2023) was also provided.  
1.1.  Information on the product 
Isavuconazonium sulfate is a water-soluble triazole antifungal agent and the prodrug of the active 
moiety isavuconazole. Isavuconazole demonstrates a fungicidal effect by blocking the synthesis of 
ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 
dependent enzyme lanosterol 14 alpha demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to 
ergosterol. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of 
ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell 
membrane. 
Isavuconazonium sulfate is indicated in adults for the treatment of  
• 
invasive aspergillosis 
•  mucormycosis in patients for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate  
The current adult posology:  
Loading dose 
The recommended loading dose is one vial after reconstitution and dilution (equivalent to 200 mg of 
isavuconazole) every 8 hours for the first 48 hours (6 administrations in total). 
Maintenance dose 
The recommended maintenance dose is one vial after reconstitution and dilution (equivalent to 200 mg 
of isavuconazole) once daily, starting 12 to 24 hours after the last loading dose.  
Duration of therapy should be determined by the clinical response. For long-term treatment beyond 6 
months, the benefit-risk balance should be carefully considered.  
Switch to oral isavuconazole 
CRESEMBA is also available as hard capsules containing 100 mg isavuconazole, equivalent to 186 mg 
isavuconazonium sulfate. On the basis of the high oral bioavailability (98%), switching between 
intravenous and oral administration is appropriate when clinically indicated.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Study 9766-CL-0107, a phase 2, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter study to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of isavuconazonium sulfate for the treatment of 
invasive aspergillosis (IA) or invasive mucormycosis (IM) in paediatric subjects, is part of the agreed 
paediatric investigation plan (PIP) EMEA-001301-PIP02-12-M04. 
A line listing of all the concerned studies is shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Overview of concerned studies 
The primary objective of study 9766-CL-0107 was to assess the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety 
of isavuconazonium sulfate for the treatment of IA or IM in pediatric participants.  
On the basis of these studies the MAH regards all elements of the agreed PIP now as completed but 
does not seek an update of the isavuconazole product information with this submission.  
The MAH rather proposes to discuss label updates in a planned application to obtain approval for the 
use of isavuconazole in paediatric patients from 1 to < 18 years of age, and to obtain marketing 
authorisation approval of a new capsule formulation (corresponding to 40 mg isavuconazole) 
specifically developed for use in paediatric patients. Expected submission of the relevant application is 
September 2023. The application will comprise the full relevant data package containing quality, 
nonclinical and clinical data.

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulations used in the study 
In study 9766-CL-0107 all participants were assigned to open-label treatment via intravenous and/or 
oral administration with isavuconazole. 
Intravenous isavuconazonium sulfate for injection was supplied in a single-dose vial as a sterile 
lyophilized white to yellow powder containing 372.6 mg isavuconazonium sulfate (corresponding to 200 
mg isavuconazole) as currently marketed for adult patients.  
Oral isavuconazonium sulfate was supplied as oral capsules (size 3) containing 74.5 mg of 
isavuconazonium sulfate (corresponding to 40 mg isavuconazole). These size 3 capsules [smaller than 
the size 0 elongated capsule containing 186.3 mg isavuconazonium sulfate corresponding to 100 mg 
isavuconazole as being used in adults] were developed specifically for paediatric use following the 
agreed PIP and evaluated in PIP study 2, 9766-CL-0046, assessed under EMA/H/C/002734/P46/006. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted the final study report for Study 9766-CL-0107 (dated 09-05-2023). 
2.3.2.  Clinical study (9766-CL-0107) 
This paediatric study was a phase 2, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter study to assess the 
safety and tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of isavuconazonium sulphate in paediatric 
participants aged 1 to <18 years in the treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis or Invasive mucormycosis.  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Pharmacokinetics 
The objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole by monitoring the plasma 
concentrations in paediatric participants during treatment with isavuconazonium sulfate.  
Efficacy 
The efficacy objective was to assess the efficacy of isavuconazonium sulfate for the treatment of IA or 
IM in pediatric participants.  
Safety 
The safety objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of isavuconazonium sulfate in pediatric 
participants.  
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 6/31 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Palatability 
To assess the initial experience with the new oral formulation after receiving the first dose of oral 
capsules.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic endpoints included plasma trough (predose) levels on days 7, 14, 21, 42 and 84 or 
end of treatment.  
Efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint was “All-cause mortality through day 42”.  
Note: Any death that occurred after first dose of study drug through day 42 was included. Participants 
who died on or before day 42, as well as those who were lost to follow-up before day 42 were counted 
as deaths. The crude all-cause mortality rate was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the 
number of FAS subjects, and a 2-sided exact 95% CI was calculated. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints were “all-cause mortality through day 84 and EOT” and “Overall, 
clinical, radiological and mycological response through days 42 and 84 and EOT”. Response was 
assessed by the investigator using the criteria in Table 1.  
Table 1.  
Investigator Guidance for Successful Outcome 
An Adjudication Committee (AC) was set up to confirm the diagnosis and overall, clinical, mycological 
and radiological response. 
Safety 
Safety outcomes include AEs, vital signs, ECGs and laboratory parameters. 
Study design 
The study activated 30 centers in Belgium, Spain, United Kingdom, Germany and the US, from which 
10 centers enrolled participants from the US, Spain, and Belgium. 
All participants were diagnosed with at least possible IFD requiring systemic antifungal therapy, and 
entered into screening anytime between days -5 to 1 (predose). All participants were assigned to 
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 7/31 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
open-label treatment via IV or oral administration at the discretion of the investigator. The oral 
formulation could only be given to participants aged 6 to < 18 years and with a body weight of at least 
12 kg. The route of administration could change at the investigator’s discretion as needed for 
treatment purposes since the resulting exposure from the 2 routes of administration is considered 
equivalent on a mg:mg basis. 
Treatment began on day 1, and participants were followed for up to 60 days post-last dose for safety.  
Treatment was administered until the participant had a successful outcome as judged by the 
investigator or for a maximum duration of 84 days (IA) or 180 days (IM), whichever occurred first. 
Participants who were discharged from the hospital with oral capsules for at-home administration were 
required to return weekly for study drug accountability and to receive new oral dosing supplies. 
Participants who began oral administration were to complete the oral dosing acceptability assessment 
after ingesting their first oral dose. Isavuconazonium sulfate oral capsules could be administered with 
or without food. 
Pharmacokinetic endpoints included plasma trough (predose) levels on days 7, 14, 21, 42 and 84 or 
EOT. In addition, 24-hour PK samples were obtained on any 1 day between days 14 and 42 while the 
participant was still receiving study drug. The 24-hour PK samples were obtained for IV dosing as 
follows: 1 hour prior to start of infusion, within 5 minutes after the end of infusion, 4 to 10 hours and 
16 to 24 hours after start of infusion. The 24-hour PK samples were obtained for oral dosing as 
follows: a sample 1 hour prior to next oral dose, and a sample at 1, 3, 4, hours, between 6 to 8 hours 
and at 24 hours post-dosing. No samples were to be taken from IM participants after day 84. 
Throughout the study, safety and tolerability were assessed by the continuous recording of AEs, vital 
signs, ECGs and safety laboratory evaluations. 
Study participants 
Thirty pediatric participants aged 1 to < 18 years who met the following criteria were planned to be 
enrolled into the study. 
Key inclusion criteria were: 
- 
Proven, probable, or possible IFI per the [EORTC/MSG 2008] criteria. 
Note 1: Subjects with “possible” IFI were eligible for enrolment; however, diagnostic tests to 
confirm the invasive fungal disease as “probable” or “proven” according to the EORTC/MSG 
criteria were to be completed within 10 calendar days after the first dose of study drug. 
Note 2: In addition to the criteria set for mycological criteria by the EORTC/MSG in 2008, and 
only for subjects with an underlying hematologic malignancy or recipients of HSCT who also 
have clinical and radiologic features consistent with invasive fungal infection, the following are 
acceptable: 
Galactomannan (GM) levels (optical density index) meeting the below criteria are acceptable 
mycological evidence for enrolment or upgrading the diagnosis to probable IA: 
1. A single value for serum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of ≥ 1.0 or 
2. Two serum GM values of ≥ 0.5 from 2 separate samples 
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 8/31 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Key exclusion criteria were: 
- 
- 
- 
Participant had another IFD other than possible, probable or proven IA or IM. 
Participant had chronic aspergillosis, aspergilloma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. 
Participant had received mold-active systemic antifungal therapy, effective against the primary 
IMI, for more than 4 days during the 7 days preceding the first dose. 
Note: Prior use of prophylactic antifungal therapy was considered acceptable. 
- 
Participant was unlikely to survive 30 days in the investigator’s opinion 
Treatments 
Intravenous Dosing: 
Subjects weighing ≤ 37 kg: 
• 
Loading regimen of 10.0 mg/kg isavuconazonium sulfate infusions every 8 hours (± 2) for 6 doses 
(days 1 and 2) 
•  Maintenance dose of 10.0 mg/kg isavuconazonium sulfate administered once daily starting 12 to 
24 hours after the last loading dose 
Subjects weighing > 37 kg: 
• 
Loading regimen of 372 mg isavuconazonium sulfate infusions (1 vial) every 8 hours (± 2) for 6 
doses (days 1 and 2) 
•  Maintenance dose of 372 mg isavuconazonium sulfate (1 vial) administered once daily starting 12 
to 24 hours after the last loading dose 
The maximum loading and daily maintenance doses to be administered to any subject are 372 mg per 
individual dose. 
The first maintenance dose started 12 to 24 hours after the administration of the last loading dose. 
Subsequent maintenance doses were administered once daily (24 hours ± 2 hours from the previous 
maintenance dose). 
Oral dosing: 
Oral administration is only for subjects aged 6 to < 18 years and with a body weight of at least 12 kg. 
The daily dose is based on body weight and intended to deliver a dose approximately equal to 10 
mg/kg. The oral and intravenous formulations are equivalent on a mg:mg basis (see Table 2): 
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 9/31 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Table 2.   Oral Dosing Regimen by Body Weight 
The first maintenance dose started 12 to 24 hours after the administration of the last loading dose. 
Subsequent maintenance doses were administered once daily (24 hours ± 2 hours from the previous 
maintenance dose). 
Due to the similarity in exposure (AUC) between IV and oral in paediatric participants established in 
Study 9766-CL-0046, the investigator could change dosing between the 2 routes (IV vs oral) 
throughout treatment as needed for treatment purposes.  
Prohibited therapies: 
Treatments with concomitant drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and use of other 
systemic antifungals was prohibited during study drug administration.  
Note: Subjects taking prohibited medications who were willing to discontinue these medications, as 
clinically indicated and based upon the investigator’s recommendation, were allowed to washout over a 
period of 5 half-lives on a schedule determined by the investigator. 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculation was performed. A sample size of approximately 30 participants was 
planned, including at least 5 evaluable participants per age cohort: 1 to <12 years of age and 12 to 
<18 years of age. Evaluable subjects are subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Study 9766-CL-0107 was a phase 2, open-label, non-comparative study. 
Statistical Methods 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKAS) consists of all subjects who took at least 1 dose of study drug 
and who have at least 1 plasma concentration. Sampling times along with plasma concentrations of 
isavuconazonium sulfate levels will be displayed in listings. Descriptive statistics (e.g. n, mean, SD, 
minimum, median, maximum, coefficient of variation (CV), geometric mean and geometric CV will be 
provided for plasma concentrations of isavuconazole. 
EMA/492925/2023

Plasma concentration data from this study will be used to support a population pharmacokinetic (PK) 
model developed for Isavuconazonium sulfate.  
Bioanalysis 
Serum concentrations in study 9766-CL-0107 were determined using a validated LC/MS/MS method 
(method validation report: P1131.02). This method was validated within study for within- and 
between-run bias and precision. Long term stability of samples was confirmed up to 1077 days at 
-80 °C in K3EDTA and 1022 days in K2EDTA. A total of 166 plasma samples were analysed and 
maximum duration of sample storage from collection was 984 days at -80°C. A total of 17 samples 
(9.94% of total number of human plasma samples) was reanalysed for the incurred sample reanalysis. 
Of which 100% of the samples passed the incurred sample reanalysis criteria.  
Clinical 
Analysis sets 
•

Results 
Participant flow / Number analysed / Recruitment 
Thirty-one (31) participants with at least possible invasive fungal disease requiring systemic mold-
active antifungal therapy were enrolled to receive treatment. All enrolled participants received study 
drug. Therefore, 31 (100.0%) participants were included in the safety analysis and in the full analysis 
set (FAS), 13 (41.9%) participants were included in the in the modified FAS (mFAS) and 28 (90.3%) in 
the pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKAS).  
Treatment Discontinuation 
Nineteen (61.3%) of participants completed treatment by either achieving the maximum treatment 
duration (12; 38.7%) or achieving a successful outcome before maximum treatment duration was 
reached (7; 22.6%). The proportion of participants who prematurely discontinued treatment was 
38.7% (12 of 31). The 3 most common reasons for discontinuation of treatment, based on the 
investigator’s categorization, were lack of efficacy 12.9% (4 of 31), adverse event 9.7% (3 of 31), and 
other 16.1% (5 of 31). Of the participants that discontinued due to “not having the fungus intended for 
the study or not having a definitive diagnosis of IA or IM”, all met the possible IMI criteria at study 
entry. Of the 4 participants who discontinued as a result of lack of efficacy, 1 died as a result of 
progressive IFD disease 4 days after treatment discontinuation. 
Twenty-eight (28; 90.3%) participants completed both the 30-day and 60-day follow-up visits (SAF). 
Three (3; 9.7%) participants prematurely discontinued the study due to death (all unrelated to study 
treatment) and thus did not complete either the EOT + 30-day or EOT + 60-day follow-up visit.

Baseline data 
In the FAS population, the mean age of participants was 9.7 years, and the majority of participants 
were White (61.3%), 1 to < 12 years of age (61.3%) and female (80.6%), see Table 3.

Primary Underlying Disease or Condition 
The primary underlying condition of malignancy was reported in the majority (19; 61.3%) of 
participants (Table 4).  
Table 4. Overview of underlying disease or condition 
The most common malignancies were acute lymphocytic leukemia (9 participants) and acute 
myelogenous leukemia/relapse acute myelogenous leukemia (5 participants). Nearly two-thirds of 
participants (64.5%) had recently resolved or ongoing neutropenia, approximately half (45.2%) were 
on other recognized T-cell immunosuppressants and approximately one-third (32.3%) were on 
prolonged use of corticosteroids. Additional medical history often included anemia (58.1%), pyrexia 
(58.1%), hypoalbuminemia (41.9%), hypertension (32.3%) and sepsis (29.0%).

Prior and concomitant used antifungal agents 
The 3 most commonly used prior antifungal medications for the SAF population were fluconazole 
(32.3%, 10/31), liposomal amphotericin B (29.0%, 9/31) and micafungin (19.4%, 6/31), (Table 5.)  
Table 5. Prior Antifungal Therapy 
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 15/31 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The 3 most commonly used antifungal medications during the study including during the follow-up 
period were voriconazole (35.5%, 11/31), liposomal amphotericin B (29.0%, 9/31) and micafungin 
(19.4%, 6/31), Table 6. 
Table 6. Antifungal medications during the study 
According to study protocol concomitant use of other systemic antifungal agents was be avoided. 
However, other systemic antifungal agents were used in a significant number of patients with proven 
or probable IA or IM [8 of 13, (61.5%)]. The medication included agents like posaconazole, 
voriconazole and amphotericin B that are known to be active against Aspergillus infections, while 
amphotericin B is the preferred first-line treatment for invasive mucormycosis. Although there may 
have been good clinical reasons for adding these agents to the study drug, the exact contribution of 
isavuconazole to the clinical success of treatment is therefore difficult to determine. 
Mucormycosis 
The use of isavuconazole in mucormycosis is currently only approved for “adult patients for whom 
amphotericin B is inappropriate”.  
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 16/31 
 
  
 
 
 
The only pediatric patient diagnosed with proven or probable IM was treated with intravenous 
isavuconazole for 15 days, however failed on therapy and even showed progression of the disease. 
Inferred from the sparse available data, this patient received micafungin and fluconazole as prior 
systemic antifungal treatment (not mold-active agents) and as concomitant systemic antifungal 
therapy liposomal amphotericin B, micafungin and voriconazole (only amphotericin B has anti-mold 
activity). It is not clear whether this patient received isavuconazole as the initial therapy and liposomal 
amphotericin B was added to isavuconazole at a later stage or the other way around. It is also not 
clear why treatment with micafungin was continued and voriconazole was added. Did the patient have 
a mixed infection? This issue was not pursued in the context of this P46 procedure. However, the MAH 
was asked to provide details on the chosen drug regimen and its policy as part of a separate 
application.  
Pharmacokinetic results 
Isavuconazole trough concentrations were relatively lower in the 1 to < 6 years age group compared to 
the 6 to < 12 years and 12 to < 18 years age groups on days 7 and 14 (Table 7). 
Table 7. Isavuconazole Trough Plasma Concentrations 
Plasma concentration data from this study has been evaluated in combination with data from other 
paediatric studies in a population-based pharmacokinetic model (Study 9766-PK-0009). 
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 17/31 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Duration of Exposure to study drug 
The mean total study drug duration (IV and oral ) was 57.7 days. The median duration of study drug 
administration was 55 days (range 2-181 days) for total dosing, 13 days for intravenous dosing and 64 
days for oral dosing. Twenty-four (77.4%) of participants received ≥ 14 days of isavuconazonium 
sulfate treatment and 19 (61.3%) had ≥ 42 days of treatment. 
The median duration of study drug administration was slightly longer but not inconsistent with what 
was observed in the adult phase 3 controlled study ([9766-CL-0104]: 45 days for total dosing, 5 days 
for IV dosing and 56 days for oral dosing). The exposure data in this pediatric population were 
consistent with what was observed in the adult phase 3 controlled study (9766-CL-0104). 
Efficacy results 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint - All-cause Mortality Through Day 42 (FAS) 
Two participants of 31 total (6.5%) died during the first 42 days. In the subset of proven or probable 
IA or IM, one (8.3%) participant died. The cause of death was related to the IA infection. [Table 8].  
Table 8.  
All-cause Mortality Through Day 42 (FAS) 
One additional participant died between days 42 and 84 (as a result of pre-existing atypical Griscelli 
syndrome). None of the 3 deaths was considered related to study treatment by the investigator. 
No participants died while on study drug treatment (all deaths occurred during the follow-up period).

Key Secondary efficacy endpoint - AC-assessed Overall Response at days 42 and 84 and at EOT 
The AC-assessed overall response rates for the FAS set were 29.0%, 25.8% and 54.8% at days 42 and 
84 and EOT, respectively [Table 9]. 
Table 9.  
AC-assessed Overall Response (FAS) 
Of the participants with proven or probable IA or IM, 8 participants were assessed by the AC as having 
a successful overall response at the EOT (8/13, 61.5% [IA+IM]).  
The only patient diagnosed with proven or probable IM failed on isavuconazole therapy and showed 
progression of the disease.

Other secondary efficacy endpoints 
In the FAS, at EOT, 8 of 12 (66.7%) participants with proven or probable IA and of the participants 
with possible IFD 11 of 16 (68.8%) were judged by the investigator to have had a successful clinical 
response to treatment.  
In the FAS, successful mycological response (presumed eradication) at EOT occurred in 9 of 12 
(75.0%) participants with proven or probable IA and in 2 of 16 (12.5%) participants with possible IFD.  
No further details were provided on the mycological parameters (species, MICs etc). These details will 
be part of a separate application. This issue was not pursued in the context of this P46 procedure.  
In the FAS, successful radiological response (complete or partial disappearance of radiological findings 
indicative of IFD at baseline) at EOT occurred in 8 of 12 (66.7%) participants with proven or probable 
IA and in 8 of 16 (50.0%) participants with possible IFD. 
Safety results 
Adverse events (Table 10)  
Table 10.   Overview of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events and Deaths (SAF) 
Overall, a total of 29 (93.5%) participants experienced 415 treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), 24 of which were considered treatment-related. The most common TEAEs (occurring in ≥5% 
of participants) were pyrexia (29.0%), diarrhea (25.8%), vomiting (22.6%), non-cardiac chest pain 
(16.1%), stomatitis (16.1%), nausea (12.9%) and aphthous ulcer (12.9%) [for details see CSR 9766-
CL-0107 Table 11 pages 35-37].  
The MAH is asked to provide more details on TEAEs chest pain, stomatitis and aphthous ulcers:  
When did these events emerge during isavuconazole treatment and what was their course during 
treatment (or thereafter)? Are these events considered to be exposure related and/or age related? Are 
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 20/31 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
these events mainly related to oral or intravenous treatment with isavuconazole (for instance infusion 
time related)? The MAH is asked for further clarification (OC). 
Consistent with the phase 3 study in adults, more than half (58.1%) of all participants experienced a 
Serious TEAE, with a total of 42 such events. The most common SAEs were septic shock (3 [9.7%] 
participants), febrile neutropenia (3 [9.7%] participants), and stomatitis (2 [6.5%] participants). Four 
of these events were considered to be treatment-related. These 4 events all occurred in a single 
participant and comprised infusion site pain, infusion site pruritus, injection site reaction and infusion 
related reaction. One of these, injection site reaction on day 2, led to withdrawal of study treatment on 
the same day. In this pediatric population, febrile neutropenia, septic shock and stomatitis were the 
most frequently observed SAEs, similar to those in the adult population. 
Discontinuation of study drug 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported in 3 (9.7%) participants, and consisted of 
injection site reaction, hypotension, and hemoptysis in 1 participant each.  
• 
Injection site reaction occurred in a 13-year-old male on day 2 and led to discontinuation on 
the same day. The episode was moderate in severity, categorized as serious and considered 
related to study drug. 
•  Hypotension occurred in a 16-year-old female on day 1 and was ongoing, leading to 
discontinuation on day 6. The episode was severe in severity, categorized as non-serious and 
considered related to study drug. Of note, this participant died on day 26 due to ongoing 
history of septic shock. 
•  Hemoptysis occurred in a 16-year-old female on day 16 and study drug was discontinued on 
the same day. The episode was severe in severity, categorized as serious and considered 
unrelated to study drug. 
Deaths 
There were 3 deaths during the study 
•  A 15-year-old female with probable IA and a medical history of atypical Griscelli syndrome, 
type II, died on day 61 as a result of cardiovascular collapse. The last day of study drug dosing 
was day 38; drug had been withdrawn due to worsening of clinical condition related to 
comorbidities. 
•  A second participant, a 16-year-old female with possible IFD and relevant medical history of 
ongoing sepsis, died as a result of septic shock on day 26. Study drug had been withdrawn on 
day 6 due to ongoing severe drug-related TEAE of hypotension. 
•  A third participant, a 16-year-old female with proven IA and relevant medical history of 
ongoing acute humoral rejection of lung transplant, died as a result of progressive IFD on day 
15. Study drug had been withdrawn on day 10 due to lack of efficacy. 
None of the deaths were considered treatment-related by the investigator. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations, 
Hematology and chemistry  
EMA/492925/2023

No clinically significant changes from baseline were observed in any of the hematology or chemistry 
parameters  
Potentially clinically significant values for liver enzymes 
Three participants had concurrent ALT and/or AST > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN. These were 
considered by the MAH unlikely to be related to study drug and more likely to be related to the 
participants’ complex medical conditions, underlying comorbidities, and multiple concomitant 
medications. The MAH did not discuss whether these changes are related to the degree of exposure to 
isavuconazole (see also OC2). 
Vital signs, or 12-lead ECGs 
Overall, there were no clinically significant results or trends in vital signs, or 12-lead ECGs in this 
study. 
Palatability 
Overall, the majority of the participants had a neutral or positive response (“not bad, not good”, 
“good”, or “really good”) to how the oral capsule tasted, how it was to swallow, and how they would 
feel if they took the medication again. Only 1 participant had a negative response (“bad"). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetics 
In the previous P46 procedure, where study 9766-CL-0046 was assessed, paediatric patients aged 
below 12 years of age appeared to have a higher exposure with the 10 mg/kg dosing regimen. Current 
data of study 9766-CL-0107 appear to indicate the opposite. A pooled population pharmacokinetic 
analysis is planned, which should provide clarity on the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazonium in the 
paediatric age range. Potential differences between paediatric exposure and adult exposure should be 
thoroughly discussed and justified by providing evidence for the expected therapeutic window (in 
terms of both safety and efficacy). As limited information was provided in this procedure, this issue is 
not pursued. However, the MAH was requested to commit to providing the results of the pooled 
population pharmacokinetic analysis (Study 9766-PK-0009), which may be provided at the time of 
marketing application authorisation for the extension of the indication. (OC) 
Furthermore, the MAH was reminded of the comments already made during a previous P46 procedure 
on study 9766-CL-0046 (EMA/H/C/002734/P46/006) that are relevant at time of marketing application 
and/or submission of the population pharmacokinetic analysis results. Most importantly; 
- 
It is advised to include additional diagnostic plots in future applications as there appears to be 
a deviation in the population predicted concentrations versus observed concentrations in the 
goodness-of-fit plot in the population pharmacokinetic model (Study 9766-PK-0008), which 
could indicate differences in PK in the paediatric population as compared to the adult 
population.  
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 22/31 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
It would be valuable to evaluate the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters, in 
particular Cmax, and safety effects in the paediatric population as the previously provided 
analyses focusses mainly on efficacy.  
Efficacy 
No formal prospectively defined efficacy assessments were planned in study 9766-CL-0107. Efficacy 
data were collected during the study only for descriptive purposes. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint in study 9766-CL-0107 was All-cause Mortality Through Day 42 (FAS). Two 
of 31 total (6.5%) pediatric patients died during the first 42 days, which is a relatively low number 
when compared to that reported in adults (18.7%). In the most important subset of patients diagnosed 
with proven or probable Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) or Invasive Mucormycosis (IM), 1 (8.3%) 
participant died. The cause of death was related to IA infection. 
The AC-assessed overall response rates for the FAS set at days 42 and 84 and EOT were 29.0%, 
25.8% and 54.8%, respectively. Of the 12 patients diagnosed with proven or probable IA, 8 were 
assessed by the AC as having a successful overall response at the EOT (8/12, 66.7%).  
The only patient diagnosed with proven or probable IM that was treated with intravenous 
isavuconazole for 15 days failed on therapy and showed progression of the disease. 
The efficacy results of study 9766-CL-0107 are difficult to interpret due to several study limitations: 
• 
• 
This was an open-label, non-comparative trial. 
The sample size was low. A limited number of 31 pediatric patients were enrolled in study 9766-
CL-0107.  
•  Of these, only 12 patients were diagnosed with proven or probable Invasive Aspergillosis and a 
single patient with proven or probable Invasive mucomycosis (subpopulation of major interest). 
•  Mycological details (pathogens, MICs) were not provided/discussed. 
•  According to study protocol concomitant use of other systemic antifungal agents was be avoided. 
However, these were used in a significant number of patients with proven or probable IA or IM [8 
of 13, (61.5%)]. The medication included agents like posaconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin 
B that are known to be active against Aspergillus infections, while amphotericin B is the preferred 
first-line treatment for invasive mucormycosis. Although there may have been good clinical 
reasons for adding these agents to the study drug, the exact contribution of isavuconazole to the 
clinical success of the overall treatment is therefore difficult to determine. 
Since the clinical data on efficacy (and safety) of isavuconazole in the paediatric population is very 
limited, proof of efficacy in both indications will be mainly based on adult data, it is therefore 
considered crucial that, based on the PK data obtained in adults and children, efficacy and safety 
results from trials conducted in adults can be extrapolated to the pediatric population. 
The MAH does not seek an update of the isavuconazole product information with this submission, but 
this will be applied for as part of a separate application. Whether the use of isavuconazole in paediatric 
patients from 1 to < 18 years of age will be approvable is to be decided at a later stage. The MAH 
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 23/31 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
stated that the grouped application will comprise the full relevant data package containing quality, 
nonclinical, and clinical data. It is assumed that microbiological data will be part of the package. 
Safety 
As could be expected in this severely-ill study population (due to the underlying medical 
disease/condition) and the extensive use of accompanying medication like oncolytics and 
immunosuppressants, the frequency and type of TEAEs observed in study 9766-CL-0107 was very 
high: 29 (93.5%) participants experienced 415 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The 
pattern, frequency and types of TEAE’s (as well as SAEs) that occurred in study 9766-CL-107 were in 
line with those reported in pediatric study 9766-CL-0046 and generally in line with those observed in 
the adult population. 
The most common TEAEs (occurring in ≥5% of children) were pyrexia (29.0%), diarrhea (25.8%), 
vomiting (22.6%), non-cardiac chest pain (16.1%), stomatitis (16.1%), nausea (12.9%) and aphthous 
ulcer (12.9%) [for details see CSR 9766-CL-0107 Table 11 pages 35-37]. Pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhea occurred at similar frequencies as those in the phase 3, controlled study in adult patients 
with IFD (Study 9766-CL-0104), however, non-cardiac chest pain, stomatitis and aphthous ulcer were 
not common in the adult study population.  
On request the MAH provided more details on TEAEs chest pain, stomatitis and aphthous ulcers, but 
from the submitted data it did not appear that these TEAEs were drug related or age related (see also 
Section 5 of this AR). 
The most common SAEs were septic shock 3 (9.7%), febrile neutropenia 3 (9.7%), and stomatitis 2 
(6.5%). Four of these events were considered to be treatment-related, all occurred in a single 
participant and led to withdrawal of study treatment (infusion site related adverse reactions). Infusion 
site related adverse reactions are well known to occur and are reported in adults as well and there 
appears to be no tendency that these reactions occur more in children than in adults. 
The clinical laboratory evaluations did not provide new insights, although the proportion of 
isavuconazole-treated participants experiencing a combined increase of AST or ALT of > 3 x ULN and 
total bilirubin > 2 x ULN in this pediatric population was higher as compared to the adult population in 
Study 9766-CL-0104 (9.7% versus 3.2%). The MAH explained that in a detailed review of the data for 
each of the 3 participants from Study 9766-CL-0107, each had confounding factors that could also 
explain the combined elevations in transaminases and total bilirubin. The MAH was asked to discuss 
whether these events are related to the degree of isavuconazole exposure and from the MAH’s 
response it does not appear that such an association exists (see Section 5 of this AR). 
3.  Request for supplementary information 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
Pharmacokinetics 
1.  The MAH is requested to commit to providing the results of the pooled population 
pharmacokinetic analysis (Study 9766-PK-0009), which may be provided at the time of 
marketing application authorisation for the extension of the indication.

2.  Pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occurred at similar frequencies as those in the phase 
3, controlled study in adult patients with IFD (Study 9766-CL-0104), however, non-cardiac 
chest pain, stomatitis and aphthous ulcer were not common in the adult study population. The 
MAH is asked to provide more details on TEAEs chest pain, stomatitis and aphthous ulcers: 
When did these events emerge during isavuconazole treatment and what was their course 
during treatment (or thereafter)? Are the these events considered to be exposure related 
and/or age related? Are these events mainly related to oral or intravenous treatment with 
isavuconazole (for instance infusion time related)? The MAH is asked for further clarification. 
3.  The proportion of isavuconazole-treated participants experiencing a combined increase of AST 
or ALT of > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN in this pediatric population was higher as 
compared to the adult population in Study 9766-CL-0104 (9.7% versus 3.2%). The MAH 
explained that in a detailed review of the data for each of the 3 participants from Study 9766-
CL-0107, each had confounding factors that could also explain the combined elevations in 
transaminases and total bilirubin. The MAH is however asked to discuss whether these events 
are related to the degree of isavuconazole exposure. 
4.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

Question 2. 
Pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occurred at similar frequencies as those in the phase 3, 
controlled study in adult patients with IFD (Study 9766-CL-0104), however, non-cardiac chest pain, 
stomatitis and aphthous ulcer were not common in the adult study population. The MAH is asked to 
provide more details on TEAEs chest pain, stomatitis and aphthous ulcers: When did these events 
emerge during isavuconazole treatment and what was their course during treatment (or thereafter)? 
Are the these events considered to be exposure related and/or age related? Are these events mainly 
related to oral or intravenous treatment with isavuconazole (for instance infusion time related)? The 
MAH is asked for further clarification. 
MAH response (in summary) 
•  Patients with TEAEs of non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain in study 9766-CL-0107 
Mild to moderate TEAEs of non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain were reported in six of the 31 patients 
(19.4%) in study 9766-CL-0107. None of these events were considered causally related to 
isavuconazole. 
The age range of patients reported with TEAEs of non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain was 7 to 13 
years, and five of the six patients had an underlying hematologic malignancy. All six patients had 
invasive fungal disease (IFD) affecting the lungs, with two patients presenting with additional pleural 
involvement. There was no clear temporal pattern regarding the time of onset of non-cardiac chest 
pain. Four of the six patients were receiving oral isavuconazole at the time of onset of the TEAE, one 
was receiving intravenous isavuconazole, and one patient reported non-cardiac chest pain after the 
end of isavuconazole treatment. Four patients reported non-cardiac chest pain as medical history 
(within 14 days of study enrolment), which was ongoing in three patients at the time of study 
enrolment 
Five of the six patients who were reported with TEAEs of non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain had AUC 
estimates. In these five patients, the median AUC was 126.2 mg*hr/L (min – max: 73.1 – 153.8). The 
median AUC in the remaining 23 patients in the study with AUC estimates who were not reported with 
TEAEs of non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain was 99.6 mg*hr/L (min – max: 35.8 – 215.6) 
[Appendix 1., Rapp. comm. see Annexes to this AR]. 
Discussion and conclusion 
The number of patients with a pre-study medical history of non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain was 
similar (n = 7) to the number of patients reporting TEAEs of non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain (n = 
6), indicating that there was no increase in the level of non-cardiac chest pain during the study. Four 
of the six patients reported with TEAEs of non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain also had a medical 
history of non-cardiac chest pain. An additional three patients had a medical history of non-cardiac 
chest pain or chest pain but did not report TEAEs while enrolled in the study, and two patients had 
TEAEs of non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain without a medical history of either of these events 
(Table 2). 
Baseline characteristics in regard to age range and underlying hematologic malignancies were 
consistent between patients who had both a medical history and TEAE of non-cardiac chest pain or 
chest pain and those who had either a medical history or TEAE only. In view of this pattern of medical 
history and TEAEs, together with the investigators’ causality assessments that none of the TEAEs of 
non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain were study-drug-related, the lung and pleural involvement of IFD, 
and the lack of an exposure relationship, a causal effect of isavuconazole with TEAEs of non-cardiac 
chest pain or chest pain is considered highly unlikely. 
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 26/31 
 
  
 
 
The assumption that TEAEs of non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain reflect symptoms related to the 
underlying disease of pulmonary/pleural IFD, rather than a side effect of isavuconazole, is further 
supported by the fact that it is known that unspecific symptoms including chest pain are frequent in 
immunosuppressed children with pulmonary IFD (Müller 2002), and have been reported in eight 
(32%) of 25 pediatric patients with acute leukemia and IFD based on a retrospective case series 
(Tüfekçi 2015). This background rate is consistent with the percentage of non-cardiac chest pain or 
chest pain reported as medical history or TEAEs in study 9766-CL-0107.

Assessment 
The MAH conclusion that TEAEs of ‘non-cardiac chest pain or chest pain’ are to be related to the 
underlying disease of pulmonary/pleural IFD, rather than to isavuconazole therapy, is endorsed. 
Issue resolved.  
•  Patients with TEAEs of stomatitis and aphthous ulcers in study 9766-CL-0107 
In study 9766-CL-0107, TEAEs of stomatitis (n = 5) or aphthous ulcer (n = 4) were reported in 8/31 
patients (25.8%). One patient reported episodes of both stomatitis and aphthous ulcers. The age of 
patients reported with TEAEs of stomatitis or aphthous ulcers was 1 to 13 years, with a median age of 
7.5 years, compared to a median age of 10 years in the overall study population. 
There were five patients with their first TEAEs of stomatitis or aphthous ulcer reported while the 
patient was receiving isavuconazole (intravenous n = 2, oral n = 3), with maximum severity mild (n = 
3), moderate (n = 1), or severe (n = 1). There were three patients with their first TEAEs of stomatitis 
or aphthous ulcer reported after the end of isavuconazole treatment, with maximum severity mild (n = 
2), or moderate (n = 1). 
EMA/492925/2023  
Page 27/31 
 
  
 
 
 
 
A summary of each patient reported with stomatitis and/or aphthous ulcers is provided in Table 3 
(Rapp. comm. see Annexes to this AR) 
All patients with TEAEs of stomatitis or aphthous ulcers had underlying hematologic malignancies, for 
which all but one patient had received combination chemotherapy in close temporal relationship to the 
onset of the events of stomatitis or aphtous ulcers. The most commonly used intravenous 
chemotherapy agents in patients reported with stomatitis or aphthous ulcers were methotrexate (n = 5 
intravenous) and cytarabine (n = 4), both of which are known to be a frequent cause of 
chemotherapy-associated stomatitis. 
None of the TEAEs of stomatitis or aphthous ulcers were considered to be causally-related to 
isavuconazole, and no patients discontinued isavuconazole treatment due to a TEAE of stomatitis or 
aphthous ulcers. 
Seven of the eight patients who were reported with TEAEs of stomatitis and/or aphthous ulcers had 
AUC data. In these patients the median AUC was 84.3 mg*hr/L (min – max: 35.8 – 126.2). The 
median AUC in the remaining 21 patients with AUC estimates who were not reported with TEAEs of 
stomatitis or aphthous ulcers was 106.3 mg*hr/L (min – max: 37.8 – 215.6). 
Discussion and conclusion 
Patients experiencing TEAEs of stomatitis or aphthous ulcers in study 9766-CL-0107 were 
characterized by underlying hematologic malignancies and the receipt of chemotherapy in close 
temporal relationship to the onset of stomatitis or aphthous ulcers; these TEAEs were transient and did 
not show a relationship to exposure. 
Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis is the main non-hematologic complication of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy in pediatric cancer patients. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, the 
percentage of pediatric cancer patients developing oral mucositis following chemotherapy was 
estimated at 53.6%, ranging from 16.7% to 91.5% across various studies (Docimo 2022). 
In study 9766-CL-0107, 19 of 31 (61.3%) of patients had an underlying malignancy, and 15 patients 
received chemotherapy while enrolled in the study, of whom eight (53.3%) were reported with a TEAE 
of stomatitis and/or aphthous ulcer. The proportion of patients with stomatitis or aphthous ulcers was 
therefore consistent with literature reports on the incidence of this side effect seen with chemotherapy 
(Docimo 2022).  
The pharmacokinetics of the most frequently-used chemotherapy agents in the study (methotrexate 
and cytarabine) have been shown to be unaffected by isavuconazole (Yamazaki 2017), or are not 
expected to show drug-drug interactions with isavuconazole. 
In conclusion, the case review of patients reported with stomatitis or aphthous ulcers in study 9766-
CL-0107 does not indicate a causal relationship of isavuconazole with these events.

Assessment 
Mucositis and/or aphthous ulcer are complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy (incl. methotrexate and 
cytarabine) in pediatric cancer patients (Docimo 2022). There appears not to be a causal relationship 
of isavuconazole with both adverse events. From the submitted clinical data (summarized in Table 3) 
these events mainly occur following previous chemotherapy. 
Issue resolved.  
Question 3. 
The proportion of isavuconazole-treated participants experiencing a combined increase of AST or ALT 
of > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN in this pediatric population was higher as compared to the 
adult population in Study 9766-CL-0104 (9.7% versus 3.2%). The MAH explained that in a detailed 
review of the data for each of the 3 participants from Study 9766-CL-0107, each had confounding 
factors that could also explain the combined elevations in transaminases and total bilirubin. The MAH is 
however asked to discuss whether these events are related to the degree of isavuconazole exposure. 
MAH response (in summary) 
Three participants had concurrent ALT and/or AST > 3 × ULN and total bilirubin > 2 × ULN. The 
sponsor carefully evaluated each of these three cases, and for each participant concluded that the 
hepatic abnormalities were unlikely to be related to study drug, and were more likely to be related to 
the participants’ complex medical conditions, underlying comorbidities, and multiple concomitant 
medications. 
All three patients with ALT/AST/total bilirubin elevations had AUC estimates. In these patients, the 
median AUC was 117.2 mg*hr/L (min – max: 71.6 – 126.0). The median AUC in the remaining 25 
patients in the study was 99.6 mg*hr/L (min – max: 35.8 – 215.6) [Appendix 1.].

Gram-negative rod bacteremia septic shock and sepsis and Cytomegalovirus viremia. She also had 
a history of elevated liver enzymes for 2 years before receiving the first dose of isavuconazole. 
Liver enzyme elevations during the study coincided with worsening of her clinical condition, and 
she died from circulatory collapse. Autopsy demonstrated liver findings that were consistent with 
sepsis. The AUC estimate at steady state in this patient was 71.55 mg mg*hr/L.  
•  A 16-year-old female patient diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and an ongoing medical 
history of sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. During study treatment, septic shock 
worsened and she developed abdominal distension and ascites, as well as veno-occlusive disease. 
She died from septic shock. The AUC estimate at steady state in this patient was 117.23 mg*hr/L. 
•  An 11-year-old female patient who was being actively treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia with 
multiple cytotoxic agents; relevant medical history included ongoing increased transaminases, 
hepatomegaly, and positive HHV-6 serology. HHV-6 is known to cause acute liver dysfunction in 
both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. During study treatment, she 
suffered from sepsis and rhabdomyolysis, both of which likely further contributed to her elevated 
liver enzymes. The AUC estimate at steady state in this patient was 125.97 mg*hr/L. 
Figure 1 provides a dot-plot of individual AUC estimates for patients in study 9766-CL-0107; the data 
do not suggest an association between exposure and the reported ALT/AST/total bilirubin increases.

Assessment 
It is agreed with the MAH that the data do not suggest an association between isavuconazole exposure 
and the reported ALT/AST/total bilirubin increases. 
Issue resolved.  
5.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
The primary objective of study 9766-CL-0107 was to assess the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety 
of isavuconazonium sulfate in the treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis or Invasive Mucormycosis in the 
pediatric population (children aged 1 to 18 years). 
The efficacy in children appears to be in line with that in adults. However, since the clinical data on the 
use of isavuconazole in the paediatric population are still very limited, proof of efficacy and safety will 
be mainly based on the existing adult data. Therefore, it is considered crucial that, based on the PK 
data obtained in adults and children, efficacy and safety results from trials conducted in adults can be 
extrapolated to the paediatric population.  
The MAH regards all elements of the agreed PIP now as completed.  
Currently, no changes in the SmPC have been proposed by the MAH, which is considered acceptable.

  PAM Fulfilled: 
No further action required, however further data are expected in the context of a separate application 
for extension of the currently-approved indications to pediatric patients, combined with a line 
extension to register an additional strength of the currently-approved oral formulation, isavuconazole 
hard capsules. The variation and line-extension have been submitted on 31 August 2023 
(EMEA/H/C/002734/X/0042/G).

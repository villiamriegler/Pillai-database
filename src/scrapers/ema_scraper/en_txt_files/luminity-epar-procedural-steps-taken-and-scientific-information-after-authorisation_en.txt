The SmPC section 6.5 has been updated as follows:  
B.II.b.2.a - Change to importer, batch release 
arrangements and quality control testing of the FP - 
Replacement/addition of a site where batch 
control/testing takes place 
1.5 ml liquid in clear borosilicate Type I glass vial, closed 
with a chlorobutyl elastomeric stopper, and sealed with an 
aluminium crimp seal having a plastic flip-off button. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
23/06/2011 
13/09/2011 
SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Luminity remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
A number of safety issues have been identified for 
Luminity, in particular some serious reactions are still 
occurring and the post marketing studies have provided 
little or no new information on the likely mechanism of 
these reactions. In addition, the product has not been on 
the EU market for almost three years. The product has just 
been re-introduced on the market on 15 June 2011. Thus, 
the CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 
yearly PSURs until otherwise stated. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Luminity, which 
requires submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded 
that the MAH should submit one additional renewal 
application in 5 years time.

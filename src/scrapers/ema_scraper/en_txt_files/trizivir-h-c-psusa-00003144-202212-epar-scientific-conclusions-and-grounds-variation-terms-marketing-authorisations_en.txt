Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for abacavir / lamivudine / 
zidovudine, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In  view  of  available  data  on  cardiovascular  events  from  the  literature  regarding  abacavir,  including  a 
plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers that the warnings and precautions for use of products 
containing  abacavir  need  to  be  revised  to  adequately  reflect  the  current  level  of  information  on 
cardiovascular  events  and,  in  line  with  the  current  therapeutic  guidelines,  that  a  recommendation 
discouraging the use of abacavir containing products in patients with high cardiovascular risk should also 
be  included  in  the  product  information.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products 
containing abacavir/ lamivudine/ zidovudine should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for abacavir / lamivudine / zidovudine the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing abacavir / lamivudine / 
zidovudine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

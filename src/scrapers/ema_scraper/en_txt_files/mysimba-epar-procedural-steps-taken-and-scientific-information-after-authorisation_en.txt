A single-dose pharmacokinetic study in patients with 
Group of variations consisting of: 
varying degrees of hepatic impairment showed that in 
patients with mild hepatic impairment, there was a modest 
Page 6/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C.I.3.b: to update section 4.8 on the list of adverse 
drug reactions and their corresponding frequencies 
following the PRAC outcome on PSUR procedure 
(PSUSA/10366/201709). 
C.I.4: to update sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC to reflect the results from a phase I open label 
parallel study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a 
single oral dose of extended-release combination of 
naltrexone and bupropion in subjects with normal 
hepatic function or varying degrees of impaired 
hepatic function.  Consequently, the 
recommendation to not use naltrexone/bupropion in 
patients with mild hepatic impairment has been 
replaced with dosing recommendations in these 
patients. Similar recommendations have also been 
included for patients with moderate and severe renal 
impairment.  
Section 4.4 has also been simplified by removing the 
warnings for contraindications as these are 
adequately reflected in section 4.3 of the SmPC. 
An updated RMP (version 12.4) was also submitted. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the warning on lactose to be in accordance with EC 
guideline on Guideline on "Excipients in the labelling 
and package leaflet of medicinal products for human 
use". 
C.I.3.b - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL 
intended to implement the outcome of a procedure 
concerning PSUR or PASS or the outcome of the 
assessment done under A 45/46 - Change(s) with 
new additional data submitted by the MAH 
increase in naltrexone concentrations. In patients with 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment, increases in the 
maximum concentration of naltrexone of ~6- and ~30-fold 
were observed for the moderate and severe patients 
respectively. Naltrexone / bupropion is contraindicated in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not 
recommended in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment, the 
maximum recommended daily dose for naltrexone / 
bupropion should be reduced to two tablets (one tablet in 
the morning and one tablet in the evening). It is 
recommended that patients with mild hepatic impairment 
initiate treatment with one tablet in the morning for the 
first week of treatment, and escalate to one tablet in the 
morning and one tablet in the evening from Week 2 
onwards.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The scope of this variation is to include a new indication for KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the treatment 
of unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) 
CRC, endometrial, gastric, small intestine, biliary, or pancreatic cancer in adults who have received prior 
therapy. 
The proposed indication is based on the results from the final analysis of KEYNOTE-164 and interim 
analysis 11 (IA11) of KEYNOTE-158 (Cohort K) trials. KEYNOTE-164 is a single-arm study of 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy in participants with previously-treated locally advanced unresectable or 
metastatic MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC). KEYNOTE-158 is a single-arm basket study of 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy in participants with advanced Non-Colorectal (non-CRC) MSI-H/dMMR 
solid tumours (Cohort K of this study). 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Targeted conditions are six solid tumours (CRC, endometrial, gastric, small intestine, biliary, and 
pancreatic cancer) with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) in 
advanced stage following prior treatments.  
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
“KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR 
CRC, endometrial, gastric, small intestine, biliary, or pancreatic cancer in adults who have received prior 
therapy.” 
During the procedure, the MAH has updated the indication as follows:  
“Keytruda as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of the following MSI-H or dMMR tumours in 
adults with: 
- unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer after previous fluoropyrimidine-based 
combination therapy; 
- advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma, who have disease progression on or 
following prior treatment with a platinum-containing therapy in any setting and who are not 
candidates for curative surgery or radiation; 
- unresectable or metastatic gastric, small intestine, or biliary cancer, who have disease 
progression on or following at least one prior therapy.” 
Epidemiology  
The prevalence of MSI-H across different tumours varied widely by tumour type and by disease stage.  
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022 
Page 8/9 
 
 
 
 
 
Several tumour types, including endometrial, colorectal, and gastric cancers were consistently found to 
have the highest MSI-H prevalence, generally above 10%1, which includes also the Lynch syndrome 
associated tumour types. For most other cancers, MSI-H prevalence was below 5%2. Among the 6 
tumour types included in the claimed indication, colorectal, endometrial, and gastric cancers (with the 
highest MSI-H prevalence) are also the most frequently diagnosed. Although not frequently diagnosed 
cancers, MSI-H prevalence in small intestine cancer is about 10%, while pancreatic cancer and biliary 
cancer have a low MSI-H prevalence of <3%. Additionally, the prevalence of MSI-H in late-stage disease 
is generally lower than in earlies cancer stages3. 
The epidemiology specific for each selected tumours included in the claimed indication is presented 
below:  
CRC: Overall, colorectal cancer ranks third in terms of incidence (33.6 per 100,000 in Northern Europe) 
and second in terms of mortality4. Less than 30% of CRC have metastases at diagnosis. MSI-H is present 
in approximately 10% to 15% of patients with CRC overall, but it’s less frequent in the more advanced 
stage (4-8%)5 6. 
Endometrial cancer: Endometrial cancer was the second most common and the fourth leading cause of 
death due to gynaecological cancer among women worldwide in 20206, with highest incidence in EU 
observed in Central and Eastern Europe (incidence rate 20.2 per 100,000). Patients are less frequently 
diagnosed at late stage III or IV (<20%, 7-8% with metastases at diagnosis). In sporadic endometrial 
cancer MSI-H is observed in 11% to 32% of the patients, with lower MSI-H prevalence of 6% to 11% in 
patients with advanced stage disease 3 7.  
Gastric Cancer: Gastric cancer is the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading 
cause of cancer death, with the highest incidence rates in Eastern Asia in particular, in Europe in Central 
and Eastern Europe (incidence rate 11.3 per 100,000)6. Gastric cancer patients are most commonly 
diagnosed at stage IV (46-57%). MSI-H is present in approximately 9% to 20% of patients with gastric 
cancer. The MSI-H prevalence is the lower the higher the stage is (between 5-8% in stage IV)3 4 8 9. 
Small Intestine Cancer: Small intestine adenocarcinoma is a rare malignancy (incidence rate of 2.4 per 
100,000) that is often diagnosed at an advanced stage10. About 10% of patients with small intestine 
cancer is MSI-H, being 2-6% in patients with advanced stage small intestine cancer as compared with 7-
15% in patients with early-stage disease 5 11.

Pancreatic Cancer: Pancreatic cancer is the twelfth most common cancer in the world, with highest 
incidence rate in Western Europe (8.6 per 100,000 people), but the fourth for mortality6. In 
approximately 70% of the cases, pancreatic cancer is diagnosed at stage IV. The reported prevalence of 
MSI-H in patients with pancreatic cancer is <2%5 12. 
Biliary Cancer: Biliary tract cancer incidence rate varies between 2-5 per 100,000 people. Biliary 
adenocarcinoma includes gallbladder cancer, the most common in the biliary tract. Cholangiocarcinomas 
(CCAs) are a diverse group of malignancies (usually adenocarcinoma) arising from the biliary epithelium, 
typically classified as either intrahepatic or extrahepatic CCA. The reported prevalence of MSI-H in 
patients with biliary cancer is 1% to 3%5. 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system repairs damaged DNA through base pair and small insertion-
deletion corrections that are erroneously generated during DNA replication. MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and 
PMS2 proteins are known MMR gene product. Mutations in the MMR genes cause dysfunctional MMR 
proteins incapable of recognising DNA mismatch in coding regions of repetitive nucleotide sequences 
called microsatellites; as a result DNA damage fails to be repaired and may lead to generation of non-
functional protein. This form of genomic instability is called microsatellite instability (MSI)13. Inactivation 
of MMR gene can either be somatic (sporadic) or of germline origin (e.g. Lynch syndrome). Lynch 
syndrome (LS) is a hereditary disorder with an autosomal dominant transmission that primarily 
predisposes to colorectal and endometrial cancer, but is also associated with other extra-colonic 
malignancies, such as stomach, small bowel, pancreatic, bladder, prostate, and biliary tract cancers14. 
MSI-H cancers are usually characterized by a high mutational burden and tumour-specific neoantigen 
load mediated by MSI and common defects in MMR, and can demonstrate highly upregulated expression 
of PD-1 and PD-L1, as well as other immune checkpoints, thereby providing a scientific rationale for PD-1 
blockade with pembrolizumab for the management of patients with MSI-H cancer15. In a series of 11,348 
patients, approximately 70% of MSI-H cases were TMB-high, but only 26% of MSI-H cases were PD-L1 
positive. The overlap between TMB, MSI, and PD-L1 differed among cancer types. Only 0.6% of the cases 
were positive for all three markers16. Not all patients with MSI-H tumours, respond to immunotherapy, 
suggesting that a deeper understanding of immune-related mechanisms in MSI-H is required. 
In literature, some characteristics features have been described for some MSI-H tumours. MSI-H CRC are 
histologically characterized by great production of mucin with extracellular accumulation, signet ring and 
medullary types, often admixed, with increased numbers of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and 
prominent Crohn’s-like lymphoid reaction17. Methylation of the MLH1 promoter region in the sporadic 
form is strongly associated with the BRAF V600E gene mutation. The presence of the BRAF V600E 
mutation in CRC essentially excludes Lynch syndrome, except for rare cases associated with PMS2 germ-
line mutation18. Women with endometrial tumours that had MMR defects were likely to have higher-grade 
cancers and more frequent lymphovascular space invasion9. Patients with MSI-H gastric cancer tend to be

older, female, to have distal tumour location, intestinal type of Lauren classification, and differentiated 
histological type11. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
MMR or MSI status can be determined by examining either (1) protein expression by IHC of 4 MMR 
proteins (MLH1/MSH2/MSH6/PMS2) or (2) 3 to 5 tumour microsatellite loci by using a PCR assay. In 
general, tumours are classified as MSI-H (including MMR deficient) when expression of at least 1 of 4 
MMR proteins is not detectable by IHC, or when at least 2 allelic size shifts among 3 to 5 analyzed 
microsatellite markers are detected by PCR. Current MMR/MSI testing with an MMR protein IHC based 
assay, PCR-based MSI loci testing, or a validated NGS panel is recommended by the NCCN, ESMO, and 
ASCO for patients with CRC19 20 21. 
The prognostic effect of MSI-H/dMMR status varies by tumour type and by stage: 
- While MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients with early-stage disease have a survival advantage, patients with MSI-
H/dMMR mCRC have a poorer prognosis and in general a trend toward worse survival outcome compared 
to microsatellite stable mCRC was highlighted22 23 24 25. No unanimous views are found in literature 
though, e.g. Price26 did not detect an association between DFS or OS with MSI status in mCRC patients 
undergoing curative resection. 
- Similarly, MSI-H/dMMR endometrial tumours have been associated with a favorable prognosis value of 
dMMR in early stage, but a poorer survival outcome in some studies in later stages, although there is no 
definitive evidence of a significant association between MMR status and detrimental survival27 28.  
- Patients with MSI-H/dMMR early stage/resected gastric cancer generally have an overall favourable 
prognosis29 30. Less is reported in literature regarding the advanced setting, e.g. the MSI status seems to 
have worse prognostic value31, so the evidence supporting the prognostic value of MSI status in the 
advanced gastric cancer setting are limited to date.

- In small intestine cancer, most literature data are showing an association between dMMR status and 
survival32 33 34 35, while few do not indicate influence on survival36 37. However, almost all available 
literature evidence in small bowel cancer referred to resected disease, while very few cases of MSI-H 
referred to metastatic disease. No conclusion can be drawn on the prognostic value of MSI status in small 
intestine cancer in an advanced setting. The literature data always referred to the histologic type of 
adenocarcinoma.  
- There is limited evidence in the literature to conclude on the prognostic value of MSI status in biliary 
cancer. Some references reported longer OS38 39, other no association with survival 40 41, but the 
conclusion is hampered by the low number of MSI-H patients identified.  
- A more favourable prognosis was seen in pancreatic MSI-H cancer after surgical resection42 43. In the 
meta-analysis by Luchini et al44, potential association between MSI/dMMR and prognosis in PDAC was not 
found, highlighting however that data are too few to draw any definitive conclusion. Evidence is too 
limited to date to conclude on the prognostic value of MSI-H status in pancreatic cancer in the 
advanced/metastatic setting. 
Management 
To date, the only approved treatment options in the EU for patients with MSI-H/dMMR cancers are 
dostarlimab for MSI-H/dMMR recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer that has progressed after 
platinum-based chemotherapy, pembrolizumab in MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) as 
first line treatment, nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for adult patients with mCRC after prior 
fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy.  
The approval of dostarlimab in MSI-H/dMMR endometrial cancer in April 2021 was based on results from 
the Phase I GARNET trial in 108 patients, showing an ORR of 43.5% (95% CI 34%, 53.4%), and median 
DOR not reached (range 2.6, 28.1+). The incidence of treatment-related AEs of Grade 3 or higher was 
13.2%45. 
Pembrolizumab was approved in the EU in January 2021 as first line treatment for patients with CRC MSI-
H/dMMR metastatic CRC based on the results of the pivotal phase III study KEYNOTE-177. A total of 307 
patients were randomized to pembrolizumab compared to standard chemotherapy (FOLFOX/FOLFIRI +/-

cetuximab or bevacizumab). Pembrolizumab showed statistically significant PFS improvement over 
standard chemotherapy [HR 0.60 (95%CI 0.45), 0.80, p=0.0002, median PFS 16.5 (95%CI 5.4, 32.4) vs 
8.2 (95%CI 6.1, 10.2)], supported by a favourable OS trend [HR 0.77 (95% CI 0.54, 1.09), p=0.0694, 
median OS NR vs 34.8 months (95%CI 26.3, NR)] and higher ORR (43.8% vs 33.1%) with durable 
responses (median DOR NR vs 10.6 months)46. 
The combination nivolumab and ipilimumab in MSI-H/dMMR CRC was approved in June 2021 based on 
the results of the single arm phase 2 study CheckMate 142. Based on 119 patients, the combination 
showed an ORR of 61.3% (95%CI 52, 70.1) by BICR, with median DOR not reached. Grade 3-4 drug-
related AEs occurred in 31.9% of the population47.   
Where there is no approved MSI-H-specific therapy, patients with MSI-H cancer are managed with the 
same Standard of Care (SOC) treatments that are used to treat other cancers regardless the molecular 
alteration. The MAH has provided a summary of efficacy results for the currently available and 
recommended treatment in the 2L+ setting relative to the 6 tumour types selected (see tables below). To 
further contextualize the results of pembrolizumab, the MAH has conducted a systematic literature review 
(SLR) and meta-analysis to provide a better estimate of the efficacy of historical comparator. All analyses 
have been provided for an MSI unselected population due to the general lack of data in this particular 
subset. The methodology of the SLR/meta-analysis is considered appropriate. It is to note however that 
the meta-analysis is heterogeneous, especially for the selection of included studies. The results of such 
meta-analyses, although cannot be regarded as strong evidence, are considered a useful indication to 
contextualize the data provided within each tumour type.

Real-world Evidence 
The associated lack or limited MSI-H/dMMR testing across various cancers prior to global approval of 
immunotherapies for specific or multiple MSI-H/dMMR cancers has presented a challenge with gathering 
real-world evidence on clinical outcomes for SOC treatments for MSI-H/dMMR cancers. The real-world 
evidence on clinical outcomes for SOC and immunotherapies for MSI-H/dMMR cancers is limited and 
mostly pertaining colon cancer, and has been summarized by the MAH below.  
A retrospective study conducted in 18 centers in France included MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC patients 
diagnosed between 2007 and 201749. Overall, 342 patients with MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC were 
included, of which 220 (64.3%), 136 (39.8%) and 56 (16.4%) patients received 1L, 2L and 3L 
chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy, respectively. The primary endpoint was PFS in patients 
receiving 1L chemotherapy. PFS and OS were also reported across various lines. Median PFS and OS on 
1L chemotherapy plus targeted therapy were 6.0 months (95% CI: 5.0, 7.8) and 26.3 months (95% CI: 
21.5, 35.2), respectively. Median PFS and OS in the 2L setting for chemotherapy with or without targeted 
therapy were 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.5, 5.4) and 21.6 months (95% CI: 14.2, 25.3), respectively. For 3L 
chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy, median PFS and OS were 3.6 months (95% CI: 2.3, 4.6) 
and 13.7 months (95% CI: 8.6, 20.8), respectively. 
Another retrospective chart review study conducted at 2 tertiary French University hospitals evaluated 
real-world clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with stage IV MSI-H/dMMR CRC and treated with 2 or 
more prior lines of SOC therapy50. Key exclusion criterion was prior or current treatment for 3L with 
immune checkpoint inhibitors. OS from the start of 3L treatment (index date) was reported along with 
BORR, CR and PR. For the 36 MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients that were included, the median OS for patients 
receiving 3L chemotherapy-based treatments was 9.0 months (95% CI: 4.0, 14.1). Median OS decreased 
to 4.1 months (95% CI: 4.0, 9.0) when survival data of patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors 
at fourth or later lines was censored at progression date of prior treatment line. For 3L treatment BORR 
was 5.7% (2 patients with PRs).  
Another study representing real-world evidence for immunotherapies, assessed clinical outcomes in 
patients with MSI-H solid tumours treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy after May 2017, following 
the FDA approval51. Patients with MSI-H solid tumours were selected from the US Flatiron Health-
Foundation Medicine clinico-genomic database, a nationwide de-identified electronic health record -
derived database linked to comprehensive genomic profiling data. Time to treatment discontinuation and 
OS from first pembrolizumab use were estimated with KM analyses of all patients and those with the most 
common tumour types. A total of 129 MSI-H patients across 33 tumour types, with CRC (N=36) and 
endometrial cancer (N=39) being the most common, received pembrolizumab. Median OS exceeded 1 
year across all tumour types, including CRC, endometrial, and other tumours (see table below).

2.1.2.  About the product 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a humanized mAb IgG4/kappa isotype directed against PD-1. By blocking 
the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/2, pembrolizumab enhances T cell lymphocyte activity 
with consequent stimulation of the immune-mediated anti-tumour activity. Pembrolizumab also 
modulates the level of IL-2, TNFα, IFNγ, and other cytokines. The antibody potentiates existing immune 
responses in the presence of antigen only; it does not non-specifically activate T cells. 
In the EU, pembrolizumab is currently approved (as monotherapy and in combination with other agents) 
for the treatment of melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, HNSCC, urothelial cancer, esophageal cancer, triple 
negative breast cancer, endometrial carcinoma and cHL. In January 2021 pembrolizumab as monotherapy 
was approved for the first-line treatment of metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch 
repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer in adults. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
• 
EMA-HTA Parallel Scientific Advice for KEYNOTE-158, 06-OCT-2015 (EMEA/H/SAH/039/3/2015/II):  
- The proposal to conduct a basket study in multiple rare tumours was discussed, which was considered 
“acceptable by the CHMP at this stage, based on available data showing the potential broad activity of 
pembrolizumab across histologies, and the potential to identify predictive biomarkers of clinical utility 
across histologies. While exploratory in nature, it cannot be excluded in principle that such a study could 
be considered for registration, taking into account the rarity and the poor treatment alternatives. 
However, provided that convincing results will emerge from the proposed study in the selected tumours, 
it will mostly depend on the type and strength of background information available at the time of filing, 
coming from the overall clinical development plan.”  
- It was discussed that “before starting such a basket trial in rare tumours, moreover aimed to support a 
regulatory approval, one (or more?) biomarker with proven predictive value regardless of histology are 
already identified in more common malignancies” and the MAH was “strongly encouraged to use 
predictive biomarker data from the extensive (external) pembrolizumab development programme to 
inform the basket study, in addition to the data generated from within the current basket study”.  
- With regard to rare tumours, it was “recommended that TTP on prior treatment is carefully captured in 
order to allow for intra-patient comparisons that could further support the efficacy of pembrolizumab in 
these rare tumours”. Such analysis has been provided (see clinical efficacy section).  
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022 
Page 19/20 
 
 
 
 
 
- The CHMP further noted that, “whilst the exploratory nature of the trial at inception is well understood, 
it is likely to be necessary, at some point, to more closely define the hypothesis that is subject to 
‘confirmatory ‘test’’, i.e. that at some point before full recruitment a decision to draw inferences based on 
histology-selected / histology-unselected / biomarker-selected /biomarker-unselected populations should 
be taken and ‘confirmed’ prospectively as the study continues.” The study seems however to be 
exploratory in nature with any confirmatory part missing.  
- The CHMP finally commented that “The strength of evidence supporting the use of the predictive 
biomarker(s) is fundamental for the interpretation of study results. Of note ORR may be a poor overall 
measure of patient benefit probably underestimating the effects on PFS/OS.” In order to “understand the 
prevalence of these biomarkers of interest and their association with OS to further characterize the 
prognostic value of these biomarkers”, the MAH proposed “a retrospective molecular epidemiology study 
from Danish National Registries and prospective/retrospective data from EORTC SPECTA (Screening 
Patients for Efficient Clinical Trial Access)”. This was considered acceptable, although recommended that 
data used are not too far back. The MAH informed that the molecular epidemiology studies from Danish 
National Registries and EORTC SPECTA were cancelled for reasons beyond the control of the MAH. As a 
result, no data were available from these sources. 
- PRO were also discussed, but the CHMP highlighted that “the interpretation of data will be limited by the 
uncontrolled setting and the rather heterogeneous patient population that will be enrolled in the study”.

EMA Scientific Advice on MSI-H CRC indication (KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-177), 22-OCT-2015 
(EMEA/H/SA/2437/8/2015/II):   
Regarding KEYNOTE-164, CHMP highlighted that “the number of patients (60) appears limited, and there 
is a risk for overestimation of the response particularly since this is a single-arm trial, so an increase in 
the sample size could be considered. To grant an indication, a truly high rate of durable responses with 
an acceptable safety profile is expected”. At the time of the Advice, KEYNOTE-177 was proposed to 
extend an MSI-H CRC indication in first line; however, pembrolizumab monotherapy has been already 
approved in EU in 1L based on KEYNOTE-177 results (January 2021).  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in conformance with applicable country or local requirements regarding 
ethical committee review, informed consent, and other statutes or regulations regarding the protection of 
the rights and welfare of human participants in biomedical research as claimed by the MAH. Clinical trials 
carried out outside of the European Union meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC as 
claimed by the MAH.  
The assessment of KN158 and KN164 did not raise concern over GCP compliance leading to request for 
GCP inspection.   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) proteins are exempted from the submission of ERA studies because they are 
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022

unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Pembrolizumab is a protein, therefore an ERA has 
not been submitted by the MAH. This is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pembrolizumab  PK  disposition  has  been  characterized  via  pooled  population  PK  analyses  using  serum 
concentration-time data contributed from subjects across various clinical studies using a time-dependent 
PK (TDPK) model. The PK reference dataset for monotherapy includes all available PK data from subjects 
enrolled  on  KEYNOTE-001,  KEYNOTE-002,  KEYNOTE-006,  KEYNOTE-010,  and  KEYNOTE-024,  with  an 
overall  sample  size  of  2993.  This  serves  as  the  PK  reference  analysis  to  support  descriptions  of 
pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in the EU SmPC. 
Based on the existing robust characterization of pembrolizumab PK, a comparison of observed PK for the 
current indication, MSI-H cancer, with the predictions from the TDPK reference model is provided with this 
EoI. 
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022 
Page 21/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
Pembrolizumab is dosed via the intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely 
bioavailable. 
Distribution 
Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at 
steady state is small (6.0 L; coefficient of variation [CV]: 20%). As expected for an antibody, 
pembrolizumab does not bind to plasma proteins in a specific manner. 
Elimination 
Pembrolizumab CL is approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) after 
achieving maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]); this 
decrease in CL with time is not considered clinically meaningful. The geometric mean value (CV%) for the 
terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state. 
Pharmacokinetic in Subjects with MSI-H Cancer 
The updated clinical pharmacology results specific to this submission include: 
•PK data from subjects with MSI-H cancer from KEYNOTE-158 and KEYNOTE-164, receiving pembrolizumab 
200 mg Q3W as monotherapy agent.  
•A comparison of KN158 and KN164 observed PK data with reference model (TDPK) predicted PK. 
PK Data KEYNOTE-158 
KEYNOTE-158 is an ongoing, non-randomized, single arm, multi-site, open-label study of pembrolizumab 
in previously treated participants who have locally advanced unresectable or metastatic rare cancers for 
whom prior standard first-line treatment had failed. Eligible participants received pembrolizumab 200 mg 
IV Q3W.

The observed pembrolizumab serum concentrations from KEYNOTE-158 and KEYNOTE-164 in subjects with 
MSI-H cancer generally fall within the range of predicted concentrations, both after first dose and at steady 
state  (at  and  after  cycle  8)  indicating  that  the  definitive  population  TD  PK  model  provides  an  adequate 
representation of the pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in this population, in addition to other indications. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Dose regimen selection 
Pembrolizumab  is  approved  at  a  2  mg/Kg,  200  mg  Q3W  and  400  mg  Q6W  dosing  regimens  for  use  in 
multiple indications globally as monotherapy as well as in combination with small molecule or chemotherapy  
A dosing regimen of 200 mg Q3W or 400 mg Q6W is recommended for pembrolizumab in the treatment of 
adult subjects with MSI-H cancer.

PK/PD modelling: No new information regarding PK/PD modelling for pembrolizumab is available within 
this extension of indication. 
Immunogenicity 
The  existing  immunogenicity  assessment  for  pembrolizumab  for  the  monotherapy  setting  is  based  on  a 
sufficiently  large  dataset  of  patients  across  several  indications,  with  very  low  observed  rates  of  total 
treatment ADA across different pembrolizumab regimens (1.4 – 3.8%) as well as of neutralizing antibodies 
(0.4 – 1.6%). This analysis has not demonstrated impact on efficacy or safety, as currently summarized in 
the USPI and EU SmPC. This low rate of immunogenicity has been shown to be consistent across tumour 
type  and  no  clinically  meaningful  consequences  have  been  observed  in  the  subjects  with  a  positive 
immunogenicity  reading.  Based  on  the  existing  robust  characterization  of  immunogenicity  potential, 
alignment has been obtained with the US FDA and EMA that the current assessment of immunogenicity for 
pembrolizumab is adequate for non-adjuvant monotherapy settings. 
No new ADA data are provided in this submission based on the robust characterization of immunogenicity 
potential with trials in non-adjuvant monotherapy setting. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The updated clinical pharmacology results specific to this submission include: 
1)  PK  data  from  subjects  with  MSI-H  cancer  from  KEYNOTE-158  and  KEYNOTE-164,  receiving 
pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W as monotherapy agent.  
2)  A comparison of KN158 and KN164 observed PK data with reference model (TDPK) predicted PK. 
The MAH presented a clinical pharmacology report on a total of 93 patients recruited in study KEYNOTE-
158 with a cut-off date of 28-April-2017 and 60 patients in study KEYNOTE-164 with a cut-off date of 10 
February 2017.  
The reference PK/PD model is used to support pembrolizumab submission also in this therapeutic indication. 
Observed Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) concentration-time profiles at 200 mg Q3W in subjects with MSI-H 
cancer in KEYNOTE-158 were in line with the model predicted median concentrations based on Population 
PK Model using the reference dataset both at cycle 1 (after first dose) and cycle 4 (up to day 84). However, 
it is of note that in KEYNOTE-158, concentrations at cycle 4 are not likely to have reached the steady state 
(half- life 22 days). 
PK samples in KEYNOTE-164 were collected also at cycle 8 and beyond (at steady state) and the observed 
Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) concentration-time profiles in this study were in line with the model predicted 
median concentrations and 90% prediction interval (PI) at cycle 1 (after first dose) and at steady state at 
cycle 8 and beyond (at and after 21 weeks). 
Summarizing, the PK in subjects with MSI-H cancer in both trials follows a similar profile as predicted based 
on the TDPK reference model over the dosing interval, both after first dose as well as at steady state (cycle 
8 and beyond). The majority of the observed concentrations both at Cycle 1 and steady-state generally lay 
within 90% of prediction interval of the reference PK model, with only a few outliers. 
A comparison of KEYNOTE-158 and KEYNOTE-164 observed concentration values with other monotherapy 
indications such as KEYNOTE-024, KEYNOTE-045, KEYNOTE-052, KEYNOTE-055, and KEYNOTE-087 were 
provided. The comparison trough box plots and tables with statistical analysis showed that pembrolizumab 
serum concentration are similar among different tumour types.

No  dose  finding  study  was  conducted  for  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  for  treatment  of  unresectable  or 
metastatic MSI-H or dMMR colorectal, endometrial, gastric, small intestine, biliary, or pancreatic cancer in 
adults. The investigated dose and schedule of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the above reported indication 
is the same as that approved for other monotherapy indications: 200 mg IV infusion over 60 minutes Q3W. 
This is considered acceptable. 
No  new  information  regarding  PK/PD  modelling  for  pembrolizumab  is  available  within  this  extension  of 
indication. 
No additional assessments of the immunogenicity were performed. The observed incidences indicate a low 
potential of pembrolizumab to elicit anti-drug antibody formation. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology profile of pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or 
dMMR colorectal, endometrial, gastric, small intestine, biliary, or pancreatic cancer who have received 
prior therapy is consistent with historical data. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy

Treatments 
Patients received Pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W IV Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for up to a maximum of 35 
cycles (approximately 2 years).  
Treatment was continued until confirmed radiographic PD (irPD). If radiologic imaging identifies PD, 
tumour assessment should be repeated ≥4 weeks later in order to confirm PD with the option of 
continuing treatment while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression. 
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for subjects who have attained a confirmed CR (assessed 
by the site) that have received at least 8 trial treatments (approx. 6 months) of pembrolizumab and had 
at least 2 treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial CR was declared. Subjects 
who stop then experience radiographic disease progression may be eligible for up to 17 additional 
treatments (approx. 1 year) with pembrolizumab in the Second Course Phase at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
Imaging assessment 
The first on study imaging assessment should be performed at 9 weeks from the date of allocation. 
Subsequent tumour imaging should be performed Q9W for the first year, and then Q12W thereafter, or 
more frequently if clinically indicated until PD.

assessed by independent radiologist review (IRC) 
response (CR) or partial response (PR). 
of the 200 mg Q3W dose of pembrolizumab in 
participants with locally advanced unresectable or 
metastatic mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or 
microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal 
carcinoma (CRC) and who have been previously

Q3W dose of pembrolizumab in participants with 
locally advanced unresectable or metastatic dMMR 
or MSI-H CRC and who have been previously 
treated with at least 1 line of systemic standard of 
care therapy (fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin or 
fluoropyrimidine + irinotecan ± anti-VEGF/EGFR 
mAb). 
Secondary Objective(s) 
Secondary Endpoint(s) 
In both Cohort A and Cohort B separately: 
(1) Objective: To determine safety and 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical 
tolerability of pembrolizumab. 
review of all relevant parameters including 
adverse experiences (AEs), laboratory tests, vital 
signs, etc. 
(2) Objective: To evaluate duration of response 
DOR (for participants who demonstrate CR or PR) 
(DOR), disease control rate (DCR), and

to any cause, whichever occurs first. DCR is 
defined as the percentage of participants who 
have achieved confirmed CR or PR or have 
demonstrated stable disease (SD) for at least 24 
weeks prior to any evidence of progression. 
PFS is defined as the time from first day of study 
treatment to the first documented disease 
progression or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurs first. 
OS is defined as the time from first day of study 
treatment to death due to any cause.

Participants without documented death at the 
time of analysis are censored at the date of the 
last follow-up. 
Sample size 
The overall sample size is approximately 120. 
Cohort A: With a sample size of 60, the study has 93% power to reject the null hypothesis of ORR=15% 
with a one-sided type I error rate of 2.5% if the true ORR is 35%. The historical response rate is less 
than 5% in CORRECT study (regorafenib vs placebo). At alpha level of 2.5% using exact method based on 
binomial distribution, the boundary to demonstrate statistical success corresponds to an approximate 
observed ORR ≥26.7% (16/60) at α = 2.5% (one-sided). 
Cohort B: The historical response rate is about 20% for subjects with locally advanced unresectable or 
metastatic MMR deficient or MSI high CRC and have been previously treated with at least one line of 
systemic standard of care therapy. With a sample size of 60, if there are at least 19 responders observed, 
the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for ORR will be above 20%. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This is a single arm open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Population: The ASaT population was used for analysis of ORR, DOR, PFS and OS, and consists of all 
subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment. 
Efficacy analyses: The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR per RECIST 1.1 assessed by central imaging 
vendor. In Cohort A, the point estimate, 95% confidence interval, and p-value for testing the response 
rate is greater than 15% were provided using exact binomial method proposed by Clopper and Pearson 
(1934).  
In Cohort B, the point estimate and 95% confidence interval were provided using exact binomial method 
proposed by Clopper and Pearson (1934). 
Subjects in the primary analysis population (ASaT) without ORR data were counted as non-responder. 
For DCR, the point estimate, 95% confidence interval will be provided using exact binomial method 
proposed by Clopper and Pearson (1934). Subjects in the analysis population (ASaT) with missing DCR 
are considered as disease not under control. 
For DOR, Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and median estimates from the KM curves were provided as 
appropriate.

Table 11: censoring rule for DOR 
Interim analyses: For Cohort A, an interim analysis for efficacy analysis of ORR was initially planned when 
the first 40 subjects have been followed up for at least 18 weeks. However, due to the rapid enrollment of 
the remaining subjects in Cohort A, it was decided to be conducted after all 61 subjects enrolled in Cohort 
A had been followed up for at least 18 weeks. With this change, the group sequential approach based on 
the first 40 subjects as originally planned was no longer applicable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022 
Page 38/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There was no interim analysis planned for Cohort B. 
Final analysis: The final analysis was to be performed when all patients have been followed up for at least 
6 months. If data is not mature, additional analysis was planned to be performed when all patients have 
had longer follow-up time or have discontinued study therapy. In that case, the originally planned final 
analysis was to be considered supportive. 
Multiplicity: Cohort A and Cohort B were evaluated independently. No multiplicity adjustment in each 
cohort. 
Subgroup analyses: The estimate of the treatment effect for the primary endpoint was estimated and 
plotted within each category of the following classification variables: 
- Age category (≤65 vs. >65 years) 
- Sex (Female vs. Male) 
- Race (white vs. non-white) 
The consistency of the treatment effect was assessed descriptively via summary statistics by category for 
the classification variables listed above. 
Recruitment 
First participant first visit for KEYNOTE-164 was 14-SEP-2015. This study was conducted at 34 sites in 10 
countries. The data cut-off date for KEYNOTE-164 in this submission is 09-SEP-2019. As of the data cutoff 
date, 61 participants were enrolled in Cohort A (participants previously treated with ≥2 lines of prior 
therapy) and 63 in Cohort B (participants previously treated with ≥1 line of prior therapy). The median 
follow-up time was 31.4 months (range: 0.2 to 47.8 months) at the time of analysis. Updated data with 
data cut-off date 19 Feb 2021 were provided during the procedure.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Main changes in the planned conduct of the KEYNOTE-164 study implemented by protocol amendments 
are shown in the table 12 below: 
Original protocol (21-May-
2015) 
General Amendment No.1 
The indication statement has been updated to reflect clinical practice 
(08-Jul-2015) 
Allow enrollment flexibility when defining previous treatments. 
General Amendment No.2 
To further clarify prior treatments a subject should have received in order 
(19-Oct-2015) 
to be eligible for participation in the study. 
Add clarification that tumour tissue is not mandatory. 
Interim analysis for futility removed. 
Updated definition of DOR. 
General Amendment No.3 
Addition of a second cohort (Cohort B) of 60 subjects to evaluate

fluoropyrimidine + irinotecan +/- anti-VEGF/EGFR monoclonal antibody). 
The first cohort will be designated Cohort A. 
Added requirement to provide tissue sample in cohort B (optional in 
cohort A). 
General Amendment No.4 
Since the originally planned final analysis does not provide adequate data 
(04-Jan-2017) 
maturity, the protocol was amended to allow additional follow-up analysis 
to be performed. 
Multiplicity adjustment for Cohort A is removed as no longer applicable as 
the planned interim analysis was done after the enrolment of all 61 
patients and no more after 40 subjects due to fast recruitment.  
Country-specific 
Alignment with France-specific template requirements 
Amendment No.5 (06-
Mar-2017) 
General Amendment No.6 
The study was updated to recruit additional subjects with MSI-H mCRC to 
(13-Oct-2017) 
receive pembrolizumab in combination with MK-4280 (anti-LAG-3) in 3 
cohorts (C-E) with 30-60 subjects each. 
General Amendment No.7 
Alignment of dose modification language with the most current label and 
(03-Jan-2018) 
safety information for pembrolizumab. 
Pharmacokinetic/ADA evaluation and blood collection for these samples 
were removed. 
General Amendment No.8 
To allow participants access to an extension study. 
(13-Nov-2019) 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 9 (14.8%) participants in Cohort A. Of these, 2 
participants had protocol deviations considered to be clinically important: one participant developed study 
specific discontinuation criteria but was not discontinued from the study, and 1 participant did not have 
locally confirmed MSI-H or dMMR Stage IV CRC. The other important protocol deviations were related to 
safety reporting not within the timelines. Important protocol deviations were reported for 5 (7.9%) 
participants in Cohort B, none was considered to be clinically important. 
No participant’s data were excluded from analyses due to an important protocol deviation. No important 
protocol deviations were classified as a serious GCP compliance issue.

KEYNOTE-158 (Cohort K) 
Title of Study: A Clinical Trial of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Evaluating Predictive Biomarkers 
in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumours (KEYNOTE-158) 
*Selection of BMx(s) for biomarker enrichment may occur after interim analyses. Abbreviations: BMx=Biomarker; 
CRC=Colorectal carcinoma; GEP=Gene expression profile; MSI-H=Microsatellite instability-high; PD L1=Programmed 
Cell Death-Ligand 1; Q3W=Every 3 weeks; RECIST=Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours. For Cohort M, 
MSI= MSI-H excluded. 
KEYNOTE-158 is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, multicohort, Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab in 
previously treated participants with advanced solid tumours evaluated for predictive biomarkers. Cohort K 
enrolled any participant with an advanced solid tumour that was MSI-H (with the exception of CRC, which 
was being evaluated in KEYNOTE-164).  
The MAH informed that the enrollment for Chinese Cohort L was initiated in May 2020 and included 5 
patients, so no additional data in MSI-H tumours are expected from this cohort.  
Study participants 
Key Inclusion criteria: 
•  ≥18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent. 
•  Had a histologically or cytologically-documented, advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) solid 
tumour that was incurable and for which prior standard first-line treatment had failed. 
•  Had any advanced solid tumour (except CRC), which was MSI-H (Cohort K). Note: following 
enrollment of the initial approximately 100 subjects in this cohort, subsequent enrollment will be

limited such that a total of no more than approximately 20 subjects with any single specific tumour 
type are enrolled in this MSI-H cancer cohort. The IVRS system will be used to determine if subjects 
with an MSI-H tumour of a particular type may be enrolled. 
•  Had submitted an evaluable tissue sample for biomarker analysis from a tumour lesion not previously 
irradiated. 
•  Had a tumour that was positive for one or more of the pre-specified primary biomarker(s), as 
assessed by the central laboratory. 
•  Had radiologically measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 confirmed by independent central 
radiologic review. 
•  Had a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale. 
• 
Life expectancy of at least 3 months. 
•  Demonstrated adequate organ function. 
Key Exclusion criteria: 
•  Had participated in any other pembrolizumab (MK-3475) trial, or received prior therapy with an anti-
PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, or any other immune-modulating mAb. 
•  Had a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or was receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of 
immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. 
•  Had an active autoimmune disease that had required systemic treatment in the past 2 years. 
•  Had a prior anti-cancer mAb within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or had not recovered (ie, ≤ Grade 1 
or at baseline) from an AE due to mAbs administered more than 4 weeks earlier. 
•  Had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior 
to study Day 1 or had not recovered (ie, ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from an AE due to a previously 
administered agent. 
•  Had a known additional malignancy within 2 years prior to enrollment. 
•  Had known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. 
Treatments 
Patients in Cohort K received pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W IV Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for up to a 
maximum of 35 cycles (approximately 2 years).  
Treatment was continued until radiologic disease progression was confirmed by local site assessment. For 
subjects who have initial radiological evidence of radiological PD by RECIST 1.1 as determined by the site, 
the investigator may elect to continue a subject on study treatment until repeat imaging is obtained 
(irRECIST-based management) if the subject is clinically stable, based on clinical factors including 
performance status, clinical symptoms, and laboratory data.  
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for subjects who have attained a confirmed CR and have 
been treated for at least 24 weeks, receiving at least 2 doses of pembrolizumab and at least 80% of the 
planned dose beyond the date when the initial CR was declared. Subjects who stop trial treatment with 
SD, PR, or CR, may be eligible for up to 1 year of pembrolizumab if they experience disease progression 
after stopping pembrolizumab, at discretion of the investigator (Retreatment).

Imaging assessment 
The initial tumour imaging was performed after tissue collection and within 28 days prior to the date of 
Cycle 1 Day 1. The central imaging vendor confirmed presence of measurable disease. Tumour 
assessment imaging was performed at 9 weeks after Cycle 1 Day 1, and then every 9 weeks thereafter, 
or more frequently if clinically indicated. After 12 months, imaging frequency was reduced to every 12 
weeks. Local site investigator assessments will be used for subject management.

Sample size 
For patients in Group K (MSI-H), the study originally planned to enroll up to approximately 100 subjects 
with MSI-H advanced solid tumours with the exception of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). The patients 
enrolled in Group A-J with MSI-H were included in Group K for the purpose of analysis. An initial interim 
analysis was performed when 19 subjects in Group K had been followed for a minimum of 9 weeks. This 
interim analysis pooled data from patients with MSI-H across Groups A to K and was performed to 
support the filing of a supplemental biologics licensing application (sBLA) to FDA for pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in the treatment of subjects with MSI-H cancer. 
To further evaluate efficacy of subjects with MSI-H cancer across a broad range of tumour types, the 
protocol was amended (Amendment 07) to expand the enrollment in Cohort K to approximately 350 
subjects. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This is a single arm open label study.  
Statistical methods 
Population: for KEYNOTE-158, the primary population for the analysis of efficacy was based on the ASaT 
population consisting of all participants who have received at least one dose of study treatment with a 
minimum of 6 months follow-up. 
Efficacy analyses: ORR includes complete response and partial response which both need to be confirmed. 
Subjects with Not Evaluable (NE), unknown or missing responses were considered non-responders; i.e. 
they were included in the denominator when calculating the percentage. The best confirmed overall 
response is the best confirmed response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression or 
start of new anti-cancer therapy, whichever is earlier. It was planned to provide a point estimate and 
exact 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval. No hypothesis and no threshold for the primary endpoint 
ORR was formulated.  
Interim analysis: It was planned to conduct multiple interim analyses based on the primary endpoint with 
the opportunity to modify the planned sample size.  The trial is still ongoing. It was stated in the clinical 
study report that the report is based on the eleventh interim analysis.  
Multiplicity: It was planned, to review the data by the study team on an ongoing basis without multiplicity 
control.

Patient reported outcome (PRO): PRO were exploratory objectives in KN158, and thus no formal 
hypotheses were formulated. The PRO instruments used were EORTC QLQ-C30, and EuroQoL EQ-5D. The 
PRO data were summarized within each cohort, across cohorts (overall, in CR/PR, SD, and PD 
subgroups). The primary time point of interest for PRO endpoints was Week 9.  
Recruitment 
First participant first visit for KEYNOTE-158 was on 01-FEB-2016. A total of 351 participants with 26 
tumour types were allocated to Cohort K across 54 study sites in 18 countries at CCOD of 05-OCT-2020. 
Patients affected by one of the 5 tumour type proposed for the indication (i.e. MSI-H endometrial, gastric, 
small intestine, biliary, or pancreatic cancer) were 179 (50.9%). All received at least 1 dose of study 
intervention. Updated data with data cut-off date 15 Oct 2021 were provided during the procedure.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Changes in the planned conduct of the KEYNOTE-158 study implemented by protocol amendments are 
shown in the table below: 
Part of the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sponsor continued to follow its 
SOPs for study conduct, monitoring, and oversight, using a risk-based approach, consistent with Health 
Authority (FDA, EMA) guidance, to assess and mitigate the impact of the pandemic on study conduct in 
order to 1) ensure the safety of study participants, study staff, and health care providers, 2) maintain 
compliance with GCP principles, and 3) minimize risks to study data integrity. Contingency measures 
were implemented as per the Sponsor’s SOP. Exceptions and deviations from SOPs were documented.

Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations (i.e. those that may significantly impact the quality or integrity of key study 
data or that may significantly affect a participant’s rights, safety, or well-being) were reported for 14 
participants in this study. Of these, 1 participant had an important protocol deviation that was considered 
to be clinically important (a participant who develop an adverse event for which the protocol instructs 
study treatment discontinuation, but were not discontinued). All other important protocol deviations were 
related to safety reporting outside the timelines outlined in the protocol. Protocol deviations associated 
with the COVID-19 pandemic were reported for 37 participants and were considered to be not important. 
No participant’s data were excluded from analyses due to protocol deviation.

5 MSI-H cancer types – endometrial, gastric, small intestine, pancreatic, or biliary) consists of 179 
participants, corresponding to 50.9% of the overall patients in the cohort. In the overall cohort, 718 
patients were not enrolled, 684 due to screen failure, main reason being not submitting tissue from the 
same single tumour specimen used for prior MSI testing for subsequent retrospective MSI testing.  
An updated analysis with data cut-off date 15 Oct 2021 was submitted during the procedure. The 
population relevant for the indication including the 5 MSI-H cancer types included a total of 205 patients 
(additional subjects have been included in endometrial, gastric and small intestine cohorts).

Small intestine: For the 2 participants with small intestine cancer who had not received prior therapy, 1 
had surgery only and was enrolled as, per the investigator, no alternative therapy was available. For the 
other participant, although the Sponsor declined eligibility, this participant was enrolled, as per the 
investigator, no alternative therapy was available. These 2 cases were reported as not important protocol 
deviations. All but one participant had metastatic cancer. 
Biliary: Two participants had not received prior lines of therapy. One participant had declined 
chemotherapy, and one participant was not eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy due to prediction of 
acute renal toxicity; both were reported as not important protocol deviations.

An exploratory analysis of median TTP on the last prior therapy versus median PFS on pembrolizumab 
therapy was conducted. TTP on the last prior therapy was defined as the time from the start of last prior 
therapy to the progression/recurrence. If there was no progression/ recurrence reported prior to initiation 
of pembrolizumab, the participant’s data was censored at the start of experimental pembrolizumab 
therapy.

Analysis population and 
time point description 
For KEYNOTE-164, the ASaT population served as the primary population for 
the analysis. For KEYNOTE-158, the primary population for the analysis of 
efficacy was based on the ASaT population consisting of all participants with a 
minimum of 6 months follow-up, which also served as the analysis population 
for the MSI-H cancer pooled dataset.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH applied for an extension of indication for Keytruda as monotherapy for the treatment of 
unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) 
CRC, endometrial, gastric, small intestine, biliary, or pancreatic cancer in adults who have received prior 
therapy. 
The MAH explained that the six tumour types with MSI-H/dMMR included in the sought indication have 
been chosen based on a combination of factors including: 
1)  unmet need 
2)  MSI-H prevalence 
3)  enrolled participant numbers 
4)  antitumour activity observed with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal trials supporting the indication are two single arm studies:

Page 87/88 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
 
-  KEYNOTE-164: including 124 participants with previously-treated locally advanced unresectable or 
metastatic MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) treated in 2L (cohort B, n=63) or 3L+ (cohort A, 
n=61); 
-  KEYNOTE-158 (cohort K): including a total of 351 patients with 26 MSI-H/dMMR non-CRC tumour 
types that was incurable and for which prior standard first-line treatment had failed; of those, tumour 
types included in the indication are endometrial (n=68), gastric (n=42), small intestine (n= 25), 
biliary (n=22), and pancreas (n=22).  
To be eligible for the above studies, patients should have been ≥18 years of age, ECOG PS 0-1, and with 
radiologically measurable disease by RECIST 1.1. Patients with known active CNS metastases and/or 
carcinomatous meningitis were excluded.  
Enrolment in both studies was based on MSI-H/dMMR testing performed locally. Most patients were 
tested by IHC (71%), followed by PCR (33.3%) and other testing, e.g. NGS (5.6%). 30 out of 124 
patients with CRC were tested by both IHC and PCR methods locally, there were 4 discordant results 
(87% of concordance), which the MAH attribute to the different biology assessed by the two methods and 
the test taking place locally. The responses of those 4 subjects were not provided. It is understood that 
144 tumour samples were retested centrally with an IHC assay (VENTANA MMR RxDx panel). For 95 
participants (out of a total of 283) the positive percent agreement (78/95) was 82.1% (95% CI: 73.2, 
88.5). Of 17 patients found to be negative by central testing, 3/17 responded (18%). It is difficult to 
interpret those data due to small number of subjects.  
Of note, PD-L1 testing was not required, as a result for each tumour types only 20-30% of tumours have 
known PD-L1 status, thus preventing any meaningful analysis on the relation between PD-L1 expression 
and pembrolizumab activity in MSI-H tumours.  
Per inclusion criteria, all patients should have received prior treatment in the advanced setting: in 
KEYNOTE-158 patients should have been affected by incurable tumour for which prior standard first-line 
treatment had failed. For KEYNOTE-164, previous treatment with at least 2 lines of fluoropyrimidine, 
oxaliplatin, and irinotecan in Cohort A, and at least 1 line of systemic fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin or 
fluoropyrimidine + irinotecan ± anti-VEGF/EGFR mAb in Cohort B were required.  
All patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W IV for up to a maximum of 35 cycles (approximately 2 
years) until radiologic disease progression or any discontinuation criteria were met. Retreatment after PD 
was possible in specific situations. Overall, 9 patients with CRC and 4 patients with endometrial cancer 
were retreated, with 2 subjects with CRC experienced PR, 9 SD and 2 PD (one for CRC and one for 
endometrial). The available data are too limited for inclusion of information in the SmPC. Radiological 
assessment occurred every 9 weeks for the first year, then every 12 weeks in both studies.  
Both studies had Overall Response Rate (ORR) as primary endpoint, according to independent radiology 
review per RECIST 1.1. Duration of Response (DOR) was one of the secondary endpoint. ORR is 
acceptable to evaluate activity of a drug in the context of single arm studies, in addition to DOR. PFS and 
OS were also among secondary endpoints, although the single arm design in general hampers the 
assessment of time-related endpoints, given also the low number of patients in several tumour type 
cohort.  
KEYNOTE-164 Cohort A (CRC 3L+) was the only cohort with prespecified statistical hypotheses: indeed, 
with a sample size of 60 subjects, the study had 93% power to show an ORR>15% with a one-sided type 
I error rate of 2.5%. This was based on an historical response rate <5% in the CORRECT study 
(regorafenib vs placebo). On the contrary, there were no hypotheses for Cohort B, as well as no 
multiplicity adjustment for multiple cohorts (Cohort A and Cohort B), which further underlines the 
explorative nature of this trial. 
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022 
Page 88/89 
 
 
 
 
There was also no pre-specified hypothesis for study KEYNOTE-158. As discussed in the Scientific Advice 
in 2015 (EMEA/H/SAH/039/3/2015/II), KEYNOTE-158 study used an adaptive approach which was not 
rejected in principle. It was however noted that “it poses some challenges with regard to the registration 
strategy. Whilst the exploratory nature of the trial at inception is well understood, it is likely to be 
necessary, at some point, to more closely define the hypothesis that is subject to ‘confirmatory ‘test’, i.e. 
that at some point before full recruitment a decision to draw inferences based on histology-selected / 
histology-unselected / biomarker-selected / biomarker-unselected populations should be taken and 
‘confirmed’ prospectively as the study continues”. The increased sample size of Cohort K from 100 to 350 
patients is understood as a request from FDA after accelerated approval of pembrolizumab in MSI-
H/dMMR tumours, with subsequent enrolment capped at approximately 20 subjects with any single 
specific tumour type. Multiple interim looks paired with no preplanned fixed sample size might have led to 
bias in estimates and might have affected the coverage probability of interval estimates. In addition, the 
study was not adjusted for the analysis of multiple cohorts as well as for the analysis of the different 
subgroups defined by histology within Cohort K. There was no hypothesis prespecified as well as no 
formal sample size calculation performed. As a result, KEYNOTE-158 appears mainly as an exploratory 
study, with no confirmation of results in an independent prospectively analysed data set differently to 
what advised by CHMP at the time of the SA. Furthermore, the lack of multiplicity adjustment due to 
multiple interim looks (according to the CSR eleven for Cohort K), multiple cohorts (Cohort A-L) as well as 
multiple subgroups within Cohort K defined by the five tumour types underline the exploratory nature of 
the trial. The data driven post-hoc choice of the five tumour types has the high potential to lead to bias. 
Moreover, capping of recruitment appears to be based on the need to have sufficient diversity of tissue of 
origin to assess homogeneity of response (in relation to the histology-independent approval in US), rather 
than on the relative frequency of the target molecular entity across histologies.  
The ASaT population, i.e. all patients receiving at least one dose of treatment, served as the primary 
population for the analysis of the two trials. All patients have been observed for a minimum of 6 months 
follow-up.  
Progressive disease was the main reason for pembrolizumab discontinuation in all tumour types analysed. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events ranges from 5.1% in endometrial cancer to 22.7% in pancreatic 
cancer. At the data cut-off date for KEYNOTE-158 (5-Oct-2020), treatment was still ongoing in about 
25% of subjects with endometrial, gastric and small intestine cancer. Only one CRC patient was still on 
treatment at the data cut-off date for KEYNOTE-164 (9-Sep-2019).   
No concern is raised regarding the impact of protocol deviations on study results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy results are summarized by tumour type for which indication is sought.  
CRC 
Of the total 124 patients with CRC, the majority of participants in the pooled KEYNOTE-164 group were 
male (55.6%), white (67.7%), with a median age of 55.5 years. Patients were younger than in KEYNOTE-
177 (median age 63 years), the study leading to approval of pembrolizumab monotherapy in MSI-H CRC 
in 1st line, which is not clearly explicable. Most participants had an ECOG PS of 1 (58.9%) and received at 
least 1 (24.2%), 2 (38.7%) or 3 (17.7%) lines of prior treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease. 
Approximately 12% were BRAF mutant, and 37% KRAS/NRAS mutant.  
Median FU was 36.1 months (range: 0.1 to 47.8 months).  
ORR was 33.9% (95% CI: 25.6, 42.9), with 11 CR (8.9%). ORR was similar in both Cohorts A and B 
regardless number of prior lines of therapy. Median DOR was not reached (range: 3.9+ to 41.2+ 
Assessment report

months), with 95% of subjects with response ≥12 months. Based on the data provided, patients 
achieving confirmed tumour response are usually long responders, and responses can last several months 
after the administration of the last dose of pembrolizumab as shown in the swimmer plots. Median TTR 
was 4.1 months.  
Median PFS was 4.0 months (95% CI: 2.1, 7.4), and median OS was 36.1 months (95% CI: 24.0, NR).  
The MAH has provided updated efficacy data for CRC. As compared to the initial dataset, there are no 
additional patients, but 2 more years of follow-up have been provided. Updated results confirmed 
sustained and durable responses in responding patients, with median DOR still not reached in either 
cohort. Within the limits of time-related endpoints assessment in single arm trial, a plateau in PFS and OS 
curves seem evident. 
Based on literature data, patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC have a poorer prognosis and a trend toward 
worse survival outcome compared to microsatellite stable mCRC was seen according to most literature 
data (see introduction). To contextualize the results for pembrolizumab in MSI-H mCRC, the MAH has 
provided a systematic literature review/meta-analysis including a total of 22 randomized clinical trials of 
≥2L chemotherapy- and targeted therapies, although the data are available only for an unselected 
population regardless MSI status. The ORR point estimates of chemotherapy/targeted therapies analysed 
ranged from 0.9% to 47.7%. By indirect comparison of KEYNOTE-164 results with SLR/meta-analysis 
results provided by the MAH (table 23), an encouraging ORR for pembrolizumab is seen, which appear 
overall consistent with the ORR results of other immunotherapies in the same setting. While median PFS 
does appear shorter than with chemotherapy, a relevant median OS and in particular OS rate at 24 
months are observed. Median DOR for pembrolizumab is still not reached, as compared to median DOR 
ranging from 4.8 months to 15.2 months in the subset of clinical trials for which such information was 
available. When interpreting the data, the limits related to the meta-analysis, the indirect comparison and 
the single arm trial data for pembrolizumab should be considered. The MAH mentioned the results of 
study KEYNOTE-177 comparing pembrolizumab to combination chemotherapy in 1L for MSI-H mCRC, 
leading to approval in the EU of pembrolizumab in the 1L setting (EPAR Keytruda II-91). To date, the 
results of KEYNOTE-177 study are the only available controlled data for immunotherapy specifically in the 
MSI-H subset of mCRC. The demonstration of benefit for pembrolizumab over chemotherapy shown in a 
randomized controlled setting in 1L (and an indication already granted to pembrolizumab in 1L) are 
considered supportive for the use of pembrolizumab in MSI-H mCRC also in later line. Based on the 
overall evidence provided, an indication can be granted for pembrolizumab for 2L+ treatment of MSI-H 
mCRC patients. 
Endometrial cancer 
The MAH presented the results of 68 patients with advanced endometrial MSI-H/dMMR cancer who 
received pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-158 study and had at least 6 months of follow-up. Median age was 
64 years. At the time of study entry, all participants had metastatic or unresectable disease, more than 
50% had a baseline ECOG Performance Status of 1, and the majority have received at least 2 prior lines 
of therapy.  
Median FU was 16.6 months (range: 1.5 to 51.7 months). 
ORR was 48.5% (95% CI: 36.2, 61.0), with 10 CRs (14.7%). Among the 6 tumour types selected for the 
indication, ORR was the highest in endometrial cancer. Median DOR was not reached (range: 2.9 to 
47.1+ months), with 17/33 patients with ongoing response at the data cut-off date, and 86% of subjects 
with response ≥12 months. Median TTR was 2.1 months.  
Median PFS was 13.1 months (95% CI: 4.9, 34.4), while median OS was not reached at the data cut-off 
date (95% CI: 32.4, NR).  
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022 
Page 90/91 
 
 
 
 
In the updated dataset, the MAH has provided data for a total of 83 MSI-H endometrial cancer patients 
all followed for at least 6 months. The results of the updated analyses were consistent with the initial 
data, showing an ORR of 50.6% (95%CI 39.4, 61.8), including 15.7% of complete responses. Median 
DOR was not reached (range, 2.9 to 60.4+ months). 
There is no definitive evidence of a significant association between MMR status and detrimental survival in 
advanced endometrial cancer.  
To better contextualize the results, the MAH has conducted a SLR/meta-analysis identifying 23 clinical 
trials which included an unselected endometrial cancer population treated with ≥2L chemotherapy. ORR 
estimates ranged from 0% to 57.1%. DOR was available from few studies only (from 2.7 months of 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to 10.9 months for oxaliplatin). Within the limits of SLR/meta-analysis 
and of an indirect comparison, a trend toward better outcome for pembrolizumab in an MSI-H population 
as compared to chemotherapy in a population regardless of MSI-H status is suggested.  
The outcome of standard treatment in endometrial cancer was discussed in the same setting for a dMMR 
population in the context of the recent approval of pembrolizumab+lenvatinib in (EPAR Keytruda II/105). 
The results of the chemotherapy control treatment in the dMMR subgroup lies within the range of results 
shown in the meta-analysis, providing additional support. Results of clinical trials and observational 
studies of ≥2L immunotherapy (monotherapy) in MSI H/dMMR endometrial cancer overall showing ORR 
consistent with pembrolizumab results (see introduction). To conclude, an indication for pembrolizumab in 
MSI-H/dMMR previously treated endometrial cancer is considered acceptable. 
Within the procedure II/105 leading to the approval of pembrolizumab+lenvatinib in pretreated 
endometrial cancer, the CHMP concluded that, within all the limits of indirect comparison and data from 
SAT, “both the point estimates and the confidence intervals of all efficacy endpoints do not suggest any 
relevant difference in activity of the combination (pembrolizumab + lenvatinib) as compared to 
pembrolizumab alone in dMMR pretreated EC.” Given that both options (pembrolizumab monotherapy and 
the combination pembrolizumab + lenvatinib) are approved in the EU for dMMR EC, physicians should 
consider the benefit/risk balance of the available treatment options (pembrolizumab monotherapy or 
pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib) before initiating treatment in patients with advanced or 
recurrent MSI-H or dMMR endometrial carcinoma (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Gastric cancer 
Efficacy data in MSI-H/dMMR gastric cancer are coming from 42 subjects enrolled in KEYNOTE-158, with 
a median age of 67 years and ECOG performance status 1 in 57% of subjects. About 30% of patients 
were from Asia, which is understood based on the epidemiology of this disease. 55% of subjects were 
treated with 1 line of prior therapy.  
Median FU was 9.9 months (range: 1.1 to 54.5 months).  
ORR was 31.0% (95% CI: 17.6, 47.1), with 9 patients achieving CR (21.4%). Median DOR was not 
reached (range: 6.3 to 51.1+ months). 
Median PFS was 3.2 months (95% CI: 2.1, 12.9), and median OS was 11.0 months (95% CI: 5.8, 31.5).  
In the updated dataset from KEYNOTE-158, the MAH has provided additional 9 patients in the gastric 
cancer cohort (from 42 to 51). Updated ORR is 37.3% (95%CI 24.1, 51.9) with 19/51 patients 
responding (7 CR, i.e. 13.7%), which is consistent with data previously provided.   
The MAH underlined that gastric cancer is neither a rare cancer, nor is microsatellite instability a rare 
subset. The evidence supporting the prognostic value of MSI status in the advanced gastric cancer setting 
are limited to date (see introduction).   
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022 
Page 91/92 
 
 
 
 
A SLR/meta-analysis was provided, in which a total of 42 clinical studies (50 arms) were included of ≥2L 
chemo- and targeted therapies in an unselected population. ORR estimated ranged from 0% to 51.4%. 
with the exception of 3 arms showing an ORR>40%, most of the arms have an ORR estimate <30%. 
Overall short PFS and OS was observed, with median OS <1 year. 
During the procedure, the MAH presented additional 23 patients with MSI-H/dMMR gastric cancer after 
prior treatment retrieved across pembrolizumab clinical programme (KEYNOTE-016, n=5 patients, ORR 
60%, DOR not reported; KEYNOTE-059, n=7 patients, ORR 57.1%, DOR NR; KEYNOTE-061, n=11 
patients, ORR 54.5%, vs 20% in 10 patients receiving paclitaxel). The small number of patients extracted 
from different studies is a limit of the data.  
The ORR obtained with pembrolizumab in gastric cancer does not appear outstanding, although seems to 
compare favourably with most of the chemotherapy options included in the meta-analysis. As observed 
repeatedly, the benefit of pembrolizumab mostly lies on durability of response (median DOR NR, tails in 
the OS and PFS curves). The MAH will submit additional data on gastric cancer post-approval as an Annex 
II condition. 
Small intestine 
The MAH presented efficacy data for 26 subjects with MSI-H small intestine cancer. Most were male with 
median age 59 years and 58% ECOG PS 0. All patients had adenocarcinoma. 54% of patients received 
one prior line of therapy, and 23% two lines, although two participants did not receive prior therapy. 
Median FU was 18.3 months (range: 4.2 to 55.4 months). 
ORR was 48% (95% CI: 27.8, 68.7), with 4 patients achieving CR (16%). Median DOR was not reached 
(range: 2.1+ to 41.8+ months). ORR achieved with pembrolizumab in the small intestine cohort is one of 
the highest reported among the 6 tumour types selected, and responses appear durable, although the 
large confidence interval for ORR should be noted.  
Median PFS was 23.4 months (95% CI: 4.3, NR), and median OS was not reached as per data cutoff date 
(95% CI: 16.2, NR).  
As compared to the initial submission, additional 2 evaluable patients were included in the updated MSI-H 
small intestine cancer cohort treated with pembrolizumab (n=27). In the updated dataset, two additional 
patients had an objective response and one patient who previously had SD also achieved PR, for an 
updated ORR of 55.6%, 95%CI 35.3, 74.5 (15/27 patients with CR or PR). Median DOR is still not 
reached with 7 out of 12 responding patients still with ongoing response after 36 months. The MAH 
retrieved n=5 additional patients from KEYNOTE-016 study, where an ORR of 80% was observed, but 
DOR was not available.  
Almost all available literature evidence about the prognostic value of MSI-H status in small bowel cancer 
(all about adenocarcinoma) refers to resected disease, while very few cases of MSI-H metastatic disease 
are reported. Based on the available evidence, no conclusion can therefore be drawn on the prognostic 
value of MSI status in small intestine cancer in an advanced setting. It is acknowledged that historical 
data and existing treatments are limited in this disease. 
In an apparently very rare disease setting, within the limits of the data provided and the lack of reliable 
prognostic information, an indication for pembrolizumab in MSI-H small intestine cancer is considered 
justified based on the results in the updated cohort and the comparison with historical data and 
intrapatient comparison. The MAH will submit additional data on small intestine cancer post-approval as 
an Annex II condition.

Biliary  
Overall, efficacy data on 22 patients with biliary cancer have been presented. Most patients were male, 
with median age of 60.5 years, half had ECOG PS 1. Four patients had no distant metastases. Half of the 
patients received 1 prior line of treatment, and 27% a second line. Two participants did not receive prior 
systemic treatment.  
Median FU was 19.4 months (range: 1.1 to 48.5 months). 
ORR was 40.9% (95% CI: 20.7, 63.6), with 3 CR (13.6%). Median TTR was 2.4 months (range: 1.9 to 
4.2 months) and median DOR was 30.6 months (range: 6.2 to 40.5+ months). Median PFS was 4.2 
months (95% CI: 2.1, 24.9) and median OS was 19.4 months (95% CI: 6.5, NR).  
No additional MSI-H patients have been provided with the updated data. ORR and DOR were unchanged 
after one additional year of observation, with one additional patient experienced a PFS and OS event. 
The MAH retrieved 4 additional patients from KEYNOTE-016 study. Of those 4 patients, 1 responded (ORR 
25%).   
Regarding the prognostic value of MSI-H in biliary cancer, it is agreed that there is limited evidence in 
literature to conclude on the prognostic role of MSI status in this disease. For contextualization, the result 
of the SLR/meta-analysis performed by the MAH reported ORR to chemotherapy treatment in an 
unselected biliary cancer population 2L+ ranging from 0 to 30%. Historical DOR is not comparable as only 
one study did report it. Survival estimates are low for historical control, for a median OS around 6 
months.   
The most relevant limitation of pembrolizumab data in MSI biliary tract cancer is the small sample size 
(n=22). The ORR achieved seems however acceptable as compared to historical data, and in particular 
the durability of response that can be achieved, leading to a tail in PFS and OS curves. The exploratory 
intrapatient comparison TTP/PFS did not show relevant differences in median TTP/PFS but seem to 
support some long-term benefit. The MAH will submit additional data on biliary cancer post-approval as 
an Annex II condition.  
The Annex II condition is submitted according to the Commission delegated (EU) No 357/2014, c 
(uncertainties with respect to the efficacy of a medicinal product in certain sub-populations that could not 
be resolved prior to marketing authorisation and require further clinical evidence).  
Pancreatic  
A total of 22 subjects with pancreatic MSI-H/dMMR have been presented. Patients were mostly male 
(59%) with a median age of 61.5 years, and about 60% had ECOG PS 0. Approximately 30% of patients 
have received 1 and 2 prior lines of treatment, and 23% 3 prior lines.  
Median FU was 3.7 months (range: 0.4 to 55.6 months). 
ORR was 18.2% (95% CI: 5.2, 40.3). Of the 4 responding patients, 1 achieved CR (4.5%). In the ORR 
analysis there were 7 not evaluable patients out of 22 patients, and at least 5 progressed before the first 
assessment at 9 weeks, which further raise doubts on the potential for pembrolizumab to control the 
disease. The large confidence interval of ORR is noted, and the lower bound of the CI (5.1%) is rather 
disappointing. Median TTR was 2.1 months (range: 1.9 to 2.1 months). Median DOR was not reached 
(range: 8.1 to 24.3+ months), however only 4 patients were evaluated for DOR, and it is difficult to draw 
conclusion. A more conservative DOR analysis reported a median DOR of 18 months. Median duration of 
treatment in the pancreatic cohort was 1.58 months, with only a median of 3 pembrolizumab 
administrations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022 
Page 93/94 
 
 
 
 
Median PFS was 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.9, 3.4), and median OS was 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.1, 9.8), 
which appears overall disappointing.  
No additional patients have been provided with the updated dataset.  
The MAH subsequently retrieved additional 8 patients with MSI-H/dMMR pancreatic cancer from an older 
phase II study KEYNOTE-016. All patients received at least one prior therapy and had evidence of 
progressive disease prior to enrolment. For those 8 subjects, the MAH reported an ORR of 62% (5 of 8 
patients responded, 2CRs and 3 PRs). They were treated with one of the highest dose used in the 
pembrolizumab clinical programme of 10 mg/kg Q2W, while patients in KN158 received the currently 
approved dosage of 200 mg Q3W. The MAH noted that, combining KEYNOTE-016 (n=8) and KEYNOTE-
158 (n=22) participants with pancreatic cancer, an “overall” ORR of 28.3% (95% CI 12.6, 46.7) is 
achieved. There were no pre-defined hypotheses for the pancreatic cancer subset of KN016, and pooling 
a limited number of studies with differing response rates is associated with many caveats. However, the 
data from KN016 appear very different from the “pivotal” KEYNOTE-158 delineating the weakness of the 
overall evidence from very few patients coming from a subgroup of a SAT.   
With regard to the prognostic value of MSI-H in pancreatic cancer, a more favourable prognosis was seen 
in pancreatic MSI-H cancer after surgical resection while evidence is too limited to date to conclude on the 
prognostic value of MSI-H status in the advanced setting which is the one discussed in this procedure 
(see introduction).  
The MAH has provided a systematic literature review and meta-analysis including 1775 patients with 
pancreatic cancer regardless of MSI status treated with chemotherapy as 2L+ from 18 clinical trials 
(controlled and single arm trials). Based on this analysis, pembrolizumab did not appear to provide any 
relevant advantage over chemotherapy in PFS and OS. The possibility to achieve durable responses in 
this disease with IO were supported by the MAH with reference to some case reports and retrospective or 
observational studies in literature. 
An intrapatient comparison of TTP on prior therapy vs PFS on pembrolizumab therapy (median 4.1 vs 2.1 
months) did not provide support for the indication.  
In conclusion, it is acknowledged that the activity of chemotherapy in this setting appears very limited, 
and that MSI-H/dMMR pancreatic cancer is a quite uncommon condition where an unmet need post prior 
therapy is agreed. However, while the possibility to have long responses is recognised, the likelihood of 
achieving a response with pembrolizumab in MSI-H disease appears very low and not predictable. It 
remains that the ORR estimate for pembrolizumab in pancreatic cancer (18.2%, 95%CI 5.2, 40.3) is 
lower than what is generally considered by the CHMP to indicate clinically relevant activity and it is based 
on a very limited number of patients (n=22). The data from KN016 are surprising and highlight the 
limitation of making conclusion from such a low number of subjects in an uncontrolled setting, with no 
confirmation planned. An indication in MSI-H pancreatic cancer is not agreed. The MAH therefore 
removed pancreatic cancer from the applied indication.  
Data in other tumour types/pooled data 
The MAH also presented all results for all the tumour histologies enrolled in KEYNOTE-158 Cohort K study 
but not included in the sought indication, as well as a pooled analysis of the overall population treated 
within both pivotal trials (n=445).   
In cohort K of KEYNOTE-158 study, 25 tumour types were included. Endometrial cancer is the most 
represented (n=79), followed by gastric (n=51), small intestine (n=26), ovarian (n=25), pancreas and 
cholangiocarcinoma (n=22 each). All other tumour types represented included less than 20 patients each, 
some of them with only one patient, which limits the interpretation of the results. Pembrolizumab 
generally did not show outstanding activity in terms of ORR in any of the tumours not selected for the 
Assessment report

indication. Overall, there appears to be substantial heterogeneity of response depending on tumour type 
(including types for which an indication is not sought). However, duration of response is relevant, as 
median DOR was not reached in most of the cases. Median DOR was also not reached in the pooled 
analysis (range 2.1+ - 51.1+), underlying the long response in patients achieving an objective response, 
however a modest pooled ORR of 31.7% (95%CI 27.4, 36.2) was observed.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The MAH applied for an indication in 6 selected tumour types (CRC, endometrial, gastric, small intestine, 
biliary, pancreatic) with MSI-H/dMMR after prior treatment, based on the results of the single arm trials 
KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-158 Cohort K. Several limitations and uncertainties have been found in the 
dossier related to the overall exploratory nature of the data provided, with data coming from single arm 
trials and post-hoc selected subset of single arm trial, limited number of patients, no prespecified 
hypotheses, lack of multiplicity control and no confirmatory data sets. A major drawback of this 
application is that this is based on a hybrid strategy, where approval is sought for a selected subset of 
cancer types justified based on a histology-independent approach. However, the number of patients in 
some of the selected tumours are so few, that transfer of information between tumour types would seem 
to be required for regulatory conclusions. MSI-H is not a driver mutation, which complicates this 
conception. Furthermore, there appears to be substantial heterogeneity of response depending on tumour 
type (including types for which an indication is not sought). Thus, the MAH’s position that MSI-H can be 
viewed as a marker of pembrolizumab efficacy independent of the tissue of origin of the tumour, can be 
challenged. As a result of the uncertainty about the predictive value of MSI-H across tumour types, the 
B/R has been assessed separately by tumour type. The overall conclusion is that  
- an indication can be granted for pembrolizumab in MSI-H colon and endometrial cancer, for which larger 
evidence available, supported also by external data.  
- for gastric, small intestine and biliary MSI-H cancer, an indication can be acceptable for pembrolizumab 
based on the overall data provided in each tumour type, but due to the limited available evidence, the 
MAH has accepted to provide additional data post-approval (e.g. extended enrollment in single arm trial) 
to confirm the results in those 3 tumour types. 
- in pancreatic cancer, efficacy has not been established and an indication cannot be granted. The MAH 
therefore removed pancreatic cancer from the applied indication.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Annex II: “Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): in order to further characterise the efficacy of 
Keytruda in patients with MSI-H/dMMR gastric, biliary and small intestine cancers, the MAH should submit 
the results including ORR data from Cohort K and L of study KEYNOTE-158, a Phase II study investigating 
pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in previously treated patients with advanced solid tumours.” 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®, MK-3475) in the context of its intended use as 
monotherapy for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR solid tumours (CRC, 
endometrial, gastric, small intestine, biliary, or pancreatic cancer) in adults who have received prior 
therapy. 
The safety results for pembrolizumab are presented for the following 3 datasets:

• MSI-H Safety Dataset (N=475): comprised participants with MSI-H cancer who participated in 
KEYNOTE-158 Cohort K (351 participants, MSI-H population) and KEYNOTE 164 (124 participants [Cohort 
A: 61 participants; Cohort B: 63 participants] with MSI-H CRC). 
• Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Reference Safety Dataset (N=5884): The RSD contains safety data from

Deaths Due to Adverse Events 
The proportion of participants in the MSI-H Safety Dataset who experienced an AE leading to death was 
consistent with the RSD (4.6% vs 5.3%, respectively) [Table 2.7.4-msihcancer4:10]. 
The 22 AEs that led to death in the MSI-H Safety Dataset were: 
• Cardiac failure, pneumonia, and sepsis (2 participants for each AE) 
• Acute myeloid leukemia, aspiration, cardiopulmonary failure, euthanasia, gastric haemorrhage, general 
physical health deterioration, Guillain-Barre syndrome, malabsorption, myocarditis, respiratory tract 
infection, and septic shock (1 participant for each AE). Of those, myocarditis, pneumonia, and Guillain-
Barre syndrome were considered drug-related deaths by investigator.  
• Five participants died of an unknown cause (preferred term=death).

Laboratory findings 
The following laboratory parameters (all grades) occurred at an increased frequency (≥10% point 
difference) in the MSI-H Safety Dataset compared with the RSD: activated partial thromboplastin time 
increased (25.4% vs 13.4%), alkaline phosphatase increased (37.5% vs 27.2%), calcium decreased 
(35.2% vs 22.8%), calcium increased (28.7% vs 11.5%), glucose decreased (41.2% vs 10.0%), 
hemoglobin increased (31.2% vs 0.0%), potassium decreased (29.2% vs 12.7%) and sodium increased 
(24.5% vs 5.4%) [Table 5.3.5.3.3-msi-hcancer4:149]. Most lab abnormalities were Grade 1 or Grade 2. 
One participant met the predetermined protocol-specified laboratory criteria for potential DILI 
(aminotransaminase [alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase] ≥3 ×  ULN, bilirubin ≥2 ×  
ULN, and alkaline phosphatase <2 ×  ULN) [Ref. 5.3.5.2: P158V09MK3475: Table 12-7]. Although 
laboratory criteria consistent with potential DILI were met, the participant had primary gastric cancer with 
extensive liver metastases and progressive disease was noted on imaging at the time these abnormal 
laboratory values were obtained. The site did not code the event as DILI and no association to study 
treatment was noted. The participant died 1 day after these assessments.

No safety data on interaction have been submitted.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
The proportion of participants who experienced AEs leading to pembrolizumab discontinuation in the MSI-
H Safety Dataset was consistent with the RSD (9.9% vs 13.4%, respectively). 
The most frequently reported (incidence ≥1%) AE leading to treatment discontinuation in the MSI-H 
Safety Dataset, pneumonitis, occurred in 5 participants (1.1%), which occurred with a similar frequency 
in the RSD (1.6%). Alanine aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased 
occurred in 3 participants (0.6%) each; Guillain-Barre syndrome, hepatitis, sepsis, and transaminases 
increased occurred in 2 participants each (0.4%); all other AEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 1 
participant. 
Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
The proportion of participants who experienced drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of 
pembrolizumab in the MSI-H Safety Dataset was consistent with the RSD (5.7% vs 7.0%, respectively). 
The most frequently reported (incidence ≥1%) drug-related AE leading to discontinuation of 
pembrolizumab in the MSI-H Safety Dataset was pneumonitis (5 participants, 1.1%), which occurred with 
a similar frequency in the RSD (1.6%). Alanine aminotransferase increased and aspartate 
aminotransferase increased occurred in 3 participants (0.6%) each; Guillain-Barre syndrome, hepatitis, 
and transaminases increased occurred in 2 participants each (0.4%); all other drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation occurred in 1 participant. 
Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Interruption 
The proportion of participants who experienced AEs leading to treatment interruption in the MSI-H Safety 
Dataset was higher than the RSD (35.4% vs 25.4%, respectively). The most frequently reported 
(incidence ≥2%) AEs leading to interruption of pembrolizumab in the MSI-H Safety Dataset, compared 
with the RSD, were diarrhea (3.6% vs 1.9%), alanine aminotransferase increased (3.2% vs 1.2%), and 
aspartate aminotransferase increased (2.7% vs 1.1%).

Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Interruption 
The proportion of participants who experienced drug-related AEs leading to the interruption of 
pembrolizumab in the MSI-H Safety Dataset was generally consistent with the RSD (14.5% vs 14.2%, 
respectively). The most frequently reported (incidence ≥1%) drug-related AEs leading to interruption of 
pembrolizumab in the MSI-H Safety Dataset, compared with the RSD, were diarrhea (1.7% vs 1.4%) and 
alanine aminotransferase increased (1.5% vs 0.8%). 
Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period 04-SEP-2019 through 03-SEP-2020, specifically Appendix 20.3 (Numbers of Adverse Drug 
Reactions by Preferred Term from Post-authorization Sources). 
There are no records of any pembrolizumab registration being revoked or withdrawn for safety reasons in 
any country. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety evaluation of pembrolizumab monotherapy for second or later line of treatment of adult patients 
with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H cancer or dMMR (CRC, endometrial, gastric, small intestine, biliary, 
or pancreatic cancer) is based on pooled safety data (MSI-H Safety Dataset; N=475) from KEYNOTE-164 
study  and KEYNOTE-158. Both studies evaluated pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W when used either in 
participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic dMMR or MSI-H CRC (KN-164) or in 
participants with advanced solid tumours who had at least 1 prior line of therapy (KN-158). For 
comparative evaluation with the established pembrolizumab monotherapy safety profile, the 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Reference Safety Dataset (N=5884) including studies on pembrolizumab 
monotherapy for treatment of melanoma, NCSLC, HNSCC, and bladder cancer was submitted. In addition, 
safety data from the Cumulative Running Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Dataset (N=9090) is 
shown in the side-by-side columns of the tables.  
The MSI-H Safety dataset showed higher median months on treatment and mean number of 
administrations (5.49, SD+9.3 and 14.3, SD+12.83, respectively) when compared to the pembrolizumab 
RDS (4.86, SD+6.79 and 11.6, SD+10.17) or the Cumulative Running Safety DS (4.17, SD+7.15 and 
11.3, SD+10.49). In particular, proportion of subjects with extended exposure was higher for 
KN164+KN158 participants (>6 and >12 months: 47.8% and 33.9%, respectively) in respect to the other 
two datasets (RSD>6 and >12 months: 44.4% and 21.8%, Cumulative Running Safety Dataset >6 and 
>12 months: 41.3% and 21.8%, respectively). 
When compared to RSD and the Cumulative Running Safety Dataset, the higher proportion of females 
(55.2% vs 33.9% and 34.4%) and subjects aged <65 years (64.2% vs 57.5% and 57.2%) are likely to 
be attributable to the contribution of endometrial cancer to the MSI-H Safety Dataset. In the MSI-H 
Safety Dataset, participants were generally more symptomatic than in the other Safety Datasets 
(ECOG=1: 56.2% vs 49.8% in the RSD and 50.9% in the Cumulative Running Dataset). Across datasets, 
a similar proportion of subjects were White (~75%) and overall more than half were enrolled outside the 
EU (56.8%-64.5%).   
Safety profile 
In the MSI-H Safety Dataset, the summary of AEs showed an overall pembrolizumab monotherapy safety 
profile that was comparable to that of the RSD, with however slightly lower proportions in MSI-H subjects 
for almost all safety items: drug-related AEs 65.3% vs 70.2%, grade 3-5 drug-related AEs 12.6% vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022 
Page 115/116 
 
 
 
 
15.5%, SAEs 35.6% vs 38.5%, drug-related SAEs 7.2% vs 11.1%, deaths 4.6% vs 5.3%, discontinuation 
due to a drug-related AE 9.9% vs 13.4%, respectively. Only proportion of participants with dose 
modifications due to an AE was higher in the MSI-H Dataset compared to the RSD (41.1% vs 34.7%, 
respectively).    
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates confirmed the better safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
MSI-H participants in respect to the RSD showing lower event rates per 100 person-years of exposure for 
all safety items: AEs 1148 vs 1543, drug-related AEs 290 vs 483, Grade 3-5 AEs 131 vs 154, drug-
related Grade 3-5 AEs 20.71 vs 34.43, SAEs 71.40 vs 102.60, drug-related SAEs 9.04 vs 22.96, AEs 
leading to death 5.24 vs 7.99, drug-related AEs leading to death 0.71 vs 0.98, discontinuation due to AE 
11.66 vs 21.63, drug-related AEs resulting in drug discontinuation 6.90 vs 11.23, SAE resulting in drug 
discontinuation 7.38 vs 15.26, drug-related SAE resulting in drug discontinuation 3.09 vs 6.49.  
Similar to findings in the RSD, the most common AEs (occurring in >20% of subjects) in the MSI-H 
subjects were: diarrhoea (25.7%), fatigue (24.4%), nausea (22.3%). Higher frequencies in the MSI-H 
Safety Dataset compared to the RSD are found for vomiting (18.9% vs 12.4%), abdominal pain (16.6% 
vs 8.2%), back pain (13.3% vs 11.3%), ALT increased (11.2% vs 6.7%) and UTI (10.1% vs 6.5%). 
Contribution of the type of cancers included in the group of interest to this finding cannot be excluded. 
The most frequent drug-related AEs (incidence >5% of subjects) in the MSI-H Safety Dataset were 
pruritus (13.5%), fatigue (12.6%), diarrhoea (11.8%), arthralgia (10.7%), hypothyroidism (9.5%), 
asthenia (8.8%), nausea (7.8%), rash (6.9%). Except for arthralgia (10.7% in MSI-H and 7.9% in RSD), 
all PTs showed proportions that were similar or lower than those found in the RSD.  
In MSI-H participants, Grade 3-5 AEs were reported in 49.9% of subjects receiving pembrolizumab 
monotherapy, which is comparable to what was expected based on the RSD (48.1%). Most often found 
Grade 3-5 AEs generally scored slightly higher than in the RSD and were anaemia (5.7% vs 4.0%, 
respectively), ALT increased (2.9% vs 1.0%), AST increased (2.9% vs 1.1%), abdominal pain (2.5% vs 
0.7%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (2.3% vs 0.8%), dyspnoea (2.3% and 2.2%), sepsis (2.1% 
vs 0.8%). Drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs were less frequently found in MSI-H subjects in respect to RSD 
(12.6 vs 15.5%). The only PT with incidence >1% was ALT increased (1.1%). 
SAEs were reported in a similar proportion of subjects in the MSI-H Safety Dataset (35.6%) and of the 
RSD (38.5%). The most recorded SAE (>2% incidence) was sepsis, occurring in 2.1% of subjects. Drug-
related SAEs in pembrolizumab-treated subjects with MSI-H were found in 7.2%, when compared to 
11.1% of those participating to the RSD. Pneumonitis, occurring in 5 subjects, was the only PT with 
frequency >1%. 
Death due to AEs was recorded in 4.6% of subjects participating to the MSI-H Safety Database and in 
5.3% of those in the RSD. Causes of death in the 22 cases were: cardiac failure, pneumonia, and sepsis 
(2 participants for each AE); acute myeloid leukemia, aspiration, cardiopulmonary failure, euthanasia, 
gastric hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, Guillain-Barre syndrome, malabsorption, 
myocarditis, respiratory tract infection, and septic shock (1 participant for each AE); and unknown cause 
(5 participants). Of those, myocarditis, pneumonia, and Guillain-Barre syndrome were considered drug-
related deaths by investigator. Those are known ADR for Keytruda.  
Laboratory safety AEs observed with higher frequency in the MSI-H group when compared to the RSD 
were the following: activated partial thromboplastin time increased (25.4% vs 13.4%), alkaline 
phosphatase increased (37.5% vs 27.2%), calcium decreased (35.2% vs 22.8%), calcium increased 
(28.7% vs 11.5%), glucose decreased (41.2% vs 10.0%), hemoglobin increased (31.2% vs 0.0%), 
potassium decreased (29.2% vs 12.7%) and sodium increased (24.5% vs 5.4%). One participant of the 
MSI-H Safety Dataset with extensive liver disease met the criteria for potential DILI, however clinical site 
did not classify the event as such.   
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022 
Page 116/117 
 
 
 
 
In the MSI-H Safety Dataset, proportions of overall AEOSIs (22.7% vs 25.1%) and specific safety AEOSIs 
were lower than in the RSD (drug-related AEOSIs 19.4% vs 21.8%, drug-related Grade 3-5 AEOSIs 4.0% 
vs 5.6%, drug-related serious AEOSIs 3.6% vs 5.7%, discontinuation due to drug-related AEOSIs 1.5% 
vs 2.7%. As expected, specific AEOSI PTs had similar frequency across safety datasets. 
Safety profile by intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
Regarding age categories, like what is known for the RSD also in the MSI-H Safety Database a slightly 
worse safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy is found in the elderly (>65 years of age) as 
compared to the younger participants. Notably, also in the older age categories a slightly more favourable 
safety pattern is found for MSI-H subjects if compared to those contributing to the RSD. Not surprisingly, 
higher proportions of SAEs and drug-related SAEs were found in symptomatic patients (ECOG=1) 
compared to asymptomatic patients (ECOG=0). No significant safety differences are noted with regards 
to gender and enrolment region in the MSI-H Safety Dataset.  
No significant differences are noted between frequencies and incidence rates of AEs in the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD and the Cumulative Reference Safety Dataset. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, the safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy for treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic MSI-H cancer or dMMR solid tumours was comparable to the well-known 
Keytruda safety profile. No new safety concerns were identified. Notably, when considering exposure-
adjusted safety analysis incidence rates of overall and specific AEs were lower than expected based on 
the Running Safety Database for pembrolizumab monotherapy.

2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Keytruda (pembrolizumab) has been removed 
from the additional monitoring list with the renewal procedure five years after the Union reference date. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Final approved indication: KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of the following 
MSI-H or dMMR tumours in adults with: 
-unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer after previous fluoropyrimidine-based combination therapy; 
-advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma, who have disease progression on or following prior 
treatment with a platinum-containing therapy in any setting and who are not candidates for curative 
surgery or radiation; 
-unresectable or metastatic gastric, small intestine, or biliary cancer, who have disease progression on or 
following at least one prior therapy. 
3.1.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The prevalence of MSI-H across different tumours varied widely by tumour type and by disease stage. 
Endometrial, colorectal and gastric cancer have the highest MSI-H prevalence (>10%), being <5% for 
most other tumours. The prognostic effect of MSI-H/dMMR status also varies by tumour type and by 
stage, indicating generally a better prognosis in the early/resectable stages while no impact or worse 
prognosis is shown in the advanced/metastatic setting, although in the advanced stages, data are too 
limited, especially in some tumour types, to make definitive conclusion. To date, drugs specifically 
approved in EU for MSI-H/dMMR disease are the anti-PD1 agent dostarlimab in recurrent or advanced 
MSI-H/dMMR endometrial cancer after prior platinum-based treatment, pembrolizumab as first-line 
treatment of metastatic MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer, and the combination nivolumab with ipilimumab 
in metastatic MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer after prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination 
chemotherapy. Where no specific treatments are available, patients with MSI-H cancer are managed with 
the standard of care treatments used regardless of the molecular alteration.      
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on 2 single arm studies:  
-  KEYNOTE-164: including 124 participants with previously-treated locally advanced unresectable or 
metastatic MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) treated in 2L (cohort B, n=63) or 3L+ (cohort A, 
n=61); 
-  KEYNOTE-158 (cohort K): including a total of 351 patients with 26 MSI-H/dMMR non-CRC tumour 
types that was incurable and for which prior standard first-line treatment had failed. The updated 
dataset includes endometrial (n=83), gastric (n=51), small intestine (n= 27), biliary (n=22), and 
pancreas (n=22).

3.2.  Favourable effects 
-  CRC: in 124 patients, ORR was 33.9% (95% CI: 25.6, 42.9), with 11 CR (8.9%). Median DOR was 
not reached (range: 3.9+ to 41.2+ months), based on median 3 years of follow-up. An encouraging 
ORR for pembrolizumab is seen as compared to historical data in an unselected population with longer 
duration of response. The data in pre-treated patients is considered supported by a randomized 
controlled study in 1L (KN-177) based on which an indication has been already granted for 
pembrolizumab in EU. 
-  EC: in 83 patients, ORR of 50.6% (95%CI 39.4, 61.8), including 15.7% of complete responses. 
Median DOR was not reached (range, 2.9 to 60.4+ months), after a median follow up of about 22 
months. A trend toward better outcome for pembrolizumab in an MSI-H EC population as compared 
to chemotherapy in a population regardless of MSI-H status is suggested based on indirect 
comparison. The data in pre-treated patients is considered supported by indirect comparison with the 
randomized controlled Study 309–KEYNOTE-775 in 2L. Of note, another anti-PD1 agent (dostarlimab) 
has been already granted EU approval for dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer following prior treatment. 
-  Gastric, small intestine and biliary cancer: in 52 patients with MSI-H/dMMR gastric cancer, ORR 
is 37.3% (95%CI 24.1, 51.9) with 13.7% CR, and median DOR is not reached after a median follow 
up of about 14 months. A consistent trend is noted in additional patients found across Keytruda 
clinical trial programmes. The results appear to compare favourably with most of the historical 
chemotherapy options regardless MSI status. 
In 27 patients with MSI-H small intestine cancer, ORR was 55.6% (95%CI 35.3, 74.5) with median 
DOR not reached after a median follow-up of 29 months. Results are considered relevant based on 
updated cohort and an indirect comparison with historical data and intrapatient comparison, although 
the number of patients is limited in this very rare disease setting.  
In 22 patients with biliary cancer, ORR was 40.9% (95% CI: 20.7, 63.6), with 3 CR (13.6%). 
Median DOR was 30.6 months (range: 6.2 to 40.5+ months) after a median follow up of 
approximately 20 months. The ORR seems relevant as compared to historical data and TTP/PFS 
comparison. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
-  Results submitted are based on single arm trial data, and/or subgroups from single arm trial which 
were selected post-hoc, lacking multiplicity control and independent prospectively analysed 
confirmatory datasets, with limited number of patients included in some tumour types. Tissue of 
origin remains a not fully understood effect modifier of pembrolizumab in MSI-H tumours. Because of 
the limited available evidence, further characterization of the efficacy of Keytruda is requested by the 
CHMP post-approval for biliary, gastric and small intestine cancers (Annex II condition). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety evaluation is based on pooled safety data (MSI-H Safety Dataset; N=475) from the KEYNOTE-
164 and KEYNOTE-158 evaluating pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W.  
Higher median months on treatment and mean number of administrations when compared to the 
pembrolizumab RSD. 
The summary of AEs showed an overall pembrolizumab monotherapy safety profile that was 
comparable to that of the RSD, with however slightly lower proportions in MSI-H subjects for almost 
all safety items, except for dose modifications due to an AE, confirmed by exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates. 
Assessment report  
EMA/224161/2022 
Page 121/122 
 
 
 
 
Similar to the RSD, the most common AEs (>20%) in the MSI-H subjects were: diarrhoea (25.7%), 
fatigue (24.4%), nausea (22.3%). The most frequent drug-related AEs (>5%) were pruritus (13.5%), 
fatigue (12.6%), diarrhoea (11.8%), arthralgia (10.7%), hypothyroidism (9.5%), asthenia (8.8%), 
nausea (7.8%), rash (6.9%).  
The only PT with incidence >1% was ALT increased (1.1%) with regard to Drug-related Grade 3-5 
AEs. 
The most recorded SAE (>2%) was sepsis (2.1%). Pneumonitis, occurring in 5 subjects, was the only 
PT among Drug-related SAEs with frequency >1%. 
Death due to AEs was recorded in 4.6% of subjects. Of the 22 deaths due to AEs, 3 of those were 
considered drug related myocarditis, pneumonia, and Guillain-Barre syndrome, which are known ADR 
for Keytruda. 
In the MSI-H Safety Dataset, proportions of overall AEOSIs (22.7% vs 25.1%) and specific safety 
AEOSIs were lower than in the RSD. Specific AEOSI PTs had similar frequency across safety datasets. 
Slightly worse safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy is found in the elderly (>65 years of 
age) as compared to the younger participants, but better than in the RSD.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The MAH applied for an indication in selected MSI-H/dMMR tumour types after prior treatment, based on 
the results of the single arm trials KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-158 Cohort K. MSI-H is not a driver 
mutation. However, considering scientific literature data, it can be acknowledged that MSI-H status has 
generally shown to be predictive of increased activity relative to non MSI-H tumours of the same origin, 
for the treatment with checkpoint inhibitors/Keytruda. 
Clinically relevant impact of pembrolizumab targeting agents on time-dependent endpoints in MSI-H has 
been demonstrated in RCT in colorectal carcinoma and can be inferred based on an indirect comparison 
with RCT in endometrial carcinoma. Therefore, efficacy is considered established for later-line use of 
pembrolizumab in MSI-H colon-rectal and endometrial cancer. 
In gastric, small intestine and biliary MSI-H cancers, pembrolizumab efficacy is considered relevant based 
on the overall data provided in each tumour type and intrapatient comparison between response to prior 
treatment and response to subsequent pembrolizumab. This is further supported by a comparison with 
historical data; this however provides context rather than unequivocal evidence of efficacy. The target 
disease in each of these adenocarcinomas is very rare. Moreover, there are no truly satisfactory 
treatment options after progression on first line therapy.  
While the datasets are smaller than generally accepted, the CHMP notes the unmet medical need for 
these conditions. In this light, the provided evidence indicating that MSI-status status has a positive 
predictive value in the sought indications, is considered supportive of the conclusion of a positive B/R in 
the proposed indications, notwithstanding the limited size of the datasets. Because of the limited available 
evidence, however, further characterization of the efficacy of Keytruda is requested by the CHMP post-
approval. The MAH has agreed to submit data from Cohort K and L of study KN158 of additional patients 
with gastric, small intestine and biliary MSI-H cancer as Annex II condition.

While evidence is borrowed across adenocarcinomas to support approval in the rarer, less studied 
indications listed above, it remains evident that tissue of origin remains an important effect modifier for 
MSI-H tumours treated with pembrolizumab. In summary, while MSI-H status allows for the inference of 
efficacy in niches where small samples indicate high activity and alternative treatment options have 
limited utility, a fully tissue agnostic approach is not considered warranted. 
Toxicity was as expected for pembrolizumab and comparable with the known safety profile of 
pembrolizumab monotherapy reference safety dataset. No new safety signals were identified.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Of the 6 MSI-H/dMMR tumour types for which the MAH is seeking an indication, the CHMP considered the 
B/R positive in 5 of them (CRC, endometrial, small intestine, biliary, gastric).  
No new safety signals were identified.   
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In order to further characterise the efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with MSI-H/dMMR small 
intestine, gastric, and biliary cancers, the MAH will re-open Cohort K in KEYNOTE-158 to prospectively 
collect data post-approval. In addition to Cohort K in KEYNOTE-158, the MAH will submit data from 
Cohort L enrolling Chinese participants in CRC and non-CRC MSI-H cancers.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The B/R of pembrolizumab in unresectable or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer after previous 
fluoropyrimidine-based combination therapy is positive. 
The B/R of pembrolizumab in advanced or recurrent MSI-H/dMMR endometrial carcinoma who have 
disease progression on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing therapy in any setting and 
who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation is positive.  
The B/R of pembrolizumab in unresectable or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR gastric, small intestine, or biliary 
cancer, who have disease progression on or following at least one prior therapy is positive.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

Appendix: Divergent position, dated 24 March 2022 
Keytruda EMEA/H/C/003820/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
to extend the indications for Keytruda as follows: 
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of the following MSI-H or dMMR tumours in 
adults with: 
-unresectable  or  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  after  previous  fluoropyrimidine-based  combination 
therapy; 
-advanced  or  recurrent  endometrial  carcinoma,  who  have  disease  progression  on  or  following  prior 
treatment  with  a  platinum-containing  therapy  in  any  setting  and  who  are  not  candidates  for  curative 
surgery or radiation; 
-unresectable or metastatic gastric, small intestine, or biliary cancer, who have disease progression on 
or following at least one prior therapy. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
The key issue in this extension of indication application for Keytruda is that MSI-H status ought to be 
considered a driver for oncogenesis and/or predictive of a high response rate across tumour types to 
support of a histology-independent assessment approach. In our view there is insufficient evidence to 
support this.  
Therefore, in our opinion an indication for MSI-H gastric, small intestine, and biliary cancer cannot be 
approved, as the data for each indication separately is too limited to conclude on a positive B/R. The 
required substantial transfer of information between cohorts is not agreed in the absence of adequate 
support for a histology-independent approach.

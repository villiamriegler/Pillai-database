Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for metformin hydrochloride / 
sitagliptin, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Thrombocytopenia is cumulatively described in 307 reports of patients using sitagliptin-containing 
products. Forty-five of the cases describe positive de-challenges, including 4 reports also describing 
positive re-challenges. Thirty-nine of the 45 reports with positive de-challenge lack information or were 
confounded. The remaining 6 reports, especially the 4 aforementioned reports with positive re-
challenges support a true relationship between sitagliptin use and the events. This is further 
strengthened by the absence of alternative aetiologies. Cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported 
in patients treated with the fixed dose combination of sitagliptin with metformin, including a report with 
a positive de-challenge and also a positive re-challenge. As a result, section 4.8 of the Summary of 
Products Characteristics should be updated to add thrombocytopenia to the list of adverse reactions 
with a frequency rare. 
  The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for metformin hydrochloride / sitagliptin the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing metformin hydrochloride / 
sitagliptin is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.1.  Introduction 
18 December 2013 
24 February 2014 
28 March 2014 
25 April 2014 
Telzir (fosamprenavir, FPV) is available as 700 mg film-coated tablets and 50 mg/mL oral suspension and 
is approved for the treatment of HIV infection in patients 6 years old and above, in combination with low 
dose ritonavir (RTV) and other antiretrovirals agents. 
Three Phase II studies form the basis of the paediatric development programme: 
•  Study  APV29005  evaluates  safety,  tolerability,  PK  and  antiviral  activity  of  FPV/RTV  BID  regimens  in 
PI-naïve subjects 2 to <6 years of age and a BID regimen of FPV/RTV in PI-naïve and -experienced 
subjects 2 to 18 years of age. 48 week CSR has been previously submitted on 08/08/2012 (procedure 
FUM 048.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/339053/2014 
Page 2/15 
 
  
  
•  Study  APV20002  evaluates  safety,  tolerability,  PK  and  antiviral  activity  of  FPV/RTV  BID  regimens  in 
subjects  aged  4  weeks  to  <2  years.  48  week  CSR  has  been  previously  submitted  on  08/08/2012 
(procedure FUM 048.1). 
•  Study  APV20003  evaluates  safety,  tolerability,  PK  and  antiviral  activity  of  a  once  daily  regimen  of 
FPV/RTV in PI-naïve and -experienced subjects 2 to 18 years old. 168 week CSR has been previously 
submitted on 08/06/2009 (procedure P46 060). 
While  Study  APV29005  is  considered  pivotal,  Study  APV20003  and  Study  APV20002  provide  supportive 
safety data. Study APV20003 also contributes to information on resistance.  
24-week and 48-week interim data from APV29005, 48-week interim data from APV20002 and 168-week 
data from APV20003 are available. 
This  Type  II  variation  application  proposed  to  update  information  on  safety  and  antiviral  response  of 
FPV/RTV  in  HIV-1  infected  paediatric  subjects  and  also  to  update  information  on  resistance,  modifying 
SmPC Sections 4.8 and 5.1. 
Of note, there is no approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for Telzir. 
2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The Week 48 results from study APV29005 were proposed as supportive for the changes in Product 
information. Study APV29005 was a 48 week, phase II, non-comparative, open-label, multi-cohort, 
multicentre study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir BID when administered to HIV-1 infected, PI-naive and experienced, paediatric 
subjects, 2 to 18 years old and of fosamprenavir BID administered to PI-naive, paediatric subjects 2 to < 
6 Years Old.  
48 week Clinical Study Report (CSR) has been previously submitted on 08/08/2012 and assessed in 
procedures for post-authorisation measures FUM 046, FUM 048 and FUM 048.1. The design of the study 
has been previously discussed also in variation II/0018 (assessment report published), in which week 24 
CSR was provided. It could be noted that the APV29005 protocol was later amended to administer 
FPV/RTV at a dose of 23/3 mg/kg BID for the 2 to 5 year old age group to ensure target exposure is 
reached.

in APV29005 ITT(E) Population (MSD=F) 
Immunological response 
The  median  change  in  percent  CD4+  cell  count  from  baseline  showed  improvements  in  all  age  groups 
ranging  from  7%  in  children  6  to  <12  and  12  to  <18  years  to  10%  in  children  aged  2  to  <6  years 
receiving FPV/RTV. 
Resistance 
Week 48 results from study APV29005 and results up to Week 108 from Study APV20003 were regarded 
as supportive for the proposed changes. 
Among  the  81  PI-naïve  patients  treated  with  FPV/RTV,  15  paediatric  patients  met  study-defined 
virological  failure.  Treatment-emergent  major  or  amprenavir  (APV)-associated  protease  mutations  were 
observed  in  virus  isolated  from  2  treatment-experienced  but  PI-naïve  patients.  The  viral  resistance 
patterns were similar to those observed in treatment-experienced but PI-naïve HIV-infected adults. 
Among  the  77  PI-experienced  patients  treated  with  FPV/RTV,  43  paediatric  patients  met  study-defined 
virological  failure.  Treatment-emergent  major  or  amprenavir  (APV)-associated  protease  mutations  were 
observed in virus isolated from 7 patients. The viral resistance patterns were similar to those observed in 
treatment-experienced HIV-infected adults. 
2.2.3.  Discussion 
The youngest cohort (2 to <6 years) concerns subjects for whom the use of Telzir is not currently 
approved. Therefore, the efficacy results in this cohort are not discussed in more details. 
The ART/PI status was different according to cohorts (more PI-experienced patients aged from 6 to 
<12years and more ARV-naïve patients aged from 12 to <18 years). At baseline, subjects aged from 12 
to <18 years had similar viral load but a lower CD4 cells count, reflecting a longest evolution of disease. 
In both cohorts, similar efficacy results were obtained through 24-weeks and 48-weeks of treatment. 
Compared to 24-weeks results (as summarized in the current SmPC), the median increase in CD4+ cell 
count from baseline is higher at week 48 (10% in the PI-naïve subjects and 6% in the PI-experienced 
subjects vs. respectively 8% and 4% at Week 24), reflecting an adequate long term antiviral activity of 
Telzir in this population.

As expected, the rate of virological failures is higher in PI-experienced subjects (56%) than PI-naïve 
subjects (19%). The mutational profile is similar between children and adults. 
2.3.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
An integrated analysis of safety data for the FPV/RTV treatment groups from APV29005 (Week 24) and 
APV20003 (final data, Week 168) was completed in 2011 to provide a larger safety database across all 
studied age groups and increase the ability to detect small safety signals. Since this analysis, in addition 
48 week data for studies APV29005 and APV20002 have become available. 
2.3.2.  Results 
Integrated safety data from APV29005 and APV20003 
AEs regardless of causality 
Reported AEs regardless of causality are summarised below.

Vomiting  was  most  frequent  in  the  2  to  <6  years  and  6  to  <12  years  age  groups,  and  was  seen  to  a 
lesser  extent  in  the  12  to  18  years  age  group,  many  of  whom  took  tablets  rather  than  the  suspension. 
Nausea was more frequently reported in the 12 to 18 year age group than the younger age groups and 
diarrhoea and headache were more frequently reported in the older two age groups compared to the 2 to 
<6 year olds. Upper respiratory tract infection and rhinitis were more commonly reported in the 2 to <6 
years  age  group  than  in  the  older  age  groups,  reflecting  the  common  illnesses/viral  infections 
experienced in younger children. 
Drug-related AEs

Two  SAEs,  reported  in  APV29005  for  the  same  patient  at  different  time  points,  were  considered  by  the 
investigator  to  be  drug-related.  The  events  were  (1)  adverse  drug  reaction  described  as 
rash/fever/headache/swollen lips, and (2) drug hypersensitivity reported at this time by the investigator 
as an abacavir hypersensitivity reaction. 
The frequency of SAEs was similar across age groups but numbers were small. 
There were no deaths reported in APV29005 or APV20003. 
Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities 
Table 7.  Summary of Treatment-Emergent Grade 3/4 Laboratory Toxicities in More Than One Subject in 
Any Age Group for Integrated Safety Analysis of FPV/RTV for Studies APV29005 and APV20003 
The majority of subjects had hepatic transaminase, bilirubin, and lipase values that were below the level 
of clinical concern throughout the study period. 
Five  percent  (8/150)  of  subjects  had  Grade  3  LDL  cholesterol.  Increased  lipids  were  rarely  treatment-
limiting;  however,  two  subjects  (who  were  receiving  FPV/RTV  in  Study  APV20003)  discontinued  therapy 
because of hypertriglyceridemia. 
In study APV29005, Grade 3/4 neutropenia was reported in 15/104 subjects (14%). Most of the subjects 
(n=14)  had  one  event  of  neutropenia  or  two  events  with  normal  values  in  between.  Thirteen  of  the  15 
cases 
were 
taking 
concomitant 
ART  medications 
(zidovudine 
or 
stavudine) 
or 
trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole which may have contributed to the neutropenia. 
In study APV20003, Grade 3/4 neutropenia was documented more frequently (20%, 13/66) than in Study 
APV29005. Neutropenia occurred in all age cohorts, in subjects ranging from 3 to 15 years of age, and in 
both  males  and  females.  Most  cases  of  neutropenia  occurred  as  isolated  instances,  but  77%  (10/13)  of 
subjects  had  at  least  one  other  episode  of  at  least  Grade  1  neutropenia.  There  was  no  evidence  of 
downward trends in the neutrophil values during the study. The reason for the frequency of neutropenia 
is  unclear,  and  confounded  by  several  factors,  including  concomitant  medications,  possible  sample 
degradation and a change in the DAIDS toxicity gradings.

Drug-related AEs 
Table 9.  Summary of Drug-Related Adverse Events by Frequency in More Than One Subject in Studies 
APV29005 or APV20002 – Safety Population 
Serious AEs and deaths 
Drug hypersensitivity was the most frequent SAE in APV29005, but was not reported by any subjects in 
APV20002.  The  most  frequent  SAEs  reported  in  APV20002  were  pneumonia,  gastroenteritis  and 
bronchopneumonia. 
Three deaths were reported in Study APV20002: 
•  A  24-month-old  male  died  12  days  after  a  single  dose  of  FPV  and  11  days  after  a  single  dose  of 
FPV/RTV.  The  investigator  reported  that  the  subject  died  due  to  an  acute  abdominal  disorder  with 
acute  abdominal  pain  and  vomiting  of  unknown  aetiology  as  secondary  events.  The  investigator  did 
not consider the event to be related to the investigational products. 
•  A fatal outcome occurred in a 19-month-old female on Day 85 of the study. The subject experienced 
Grade 4 septicaemia and died despite resuscitation. The investigator did not consider the event to be 
related to the investigational products. The fatal AE of septicaemia for this subject does not appear in 
the AE summary tables as the last dose of investigational product was taken the day before the event 
occurred. 
•  A Grade 4 gastroenteritis and poisoning from a traditional herbal medicine occurred in a 2-month-old 
male  subject.  The  AE  was  reported  as  starting  on  03  March  2009  (Study  Day  6).  The  traditional 
herbal medicine was administered 3 days before the events while FPV, RTV and abacavir (ABC) were 
initiated  7  days  before  the  events.  The  subject  had  presented  to  a  local  clinic  on  04  Mar  2009,  the 
day  before  the  death,  with  a  history  of  diarrhoea  and  was  asked  to  return  the  next  day.  Hospital 
records indicated a history of diarrhoea, vomiting, cough and shortness of breath. On admission, the 
child was acutely ill and died later that day, on 05 Mar 2009. The investigator considered that there 
was a reasonable possibility that the acute gastroenteritis may have been caused by FPV and RTV and 
that there was no reasonable possibility that the traditional herbal medicine poisoning may have been 
caused by FPV and RTV. The death certificate cited ‘death from natural causes’.

Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities 
Table 10.  Summary of Treatment-Emergent Grade 3/4 Laboratory Toxicities in More Than One Subject 
in Studies APV29005 and APV20002 – Safety Population 
In APV20002, all five neutropenia cases resolved with continued FPV treatment.  
2.3.3.  Discussion 
Integrated safety data from APV29005 and APV20003 
No new safety concerns have been identified in the integrated safety data. 
Although vomiting was more observed in the youngest subjects (receiving oral solution) than the older 
cohort (most of them receive tablet formulation), the rate of combined upper gastrointestinal disorders 
(vomiting + nausea) was similar between the three cohorts. 
Diarrhoea was very common (19%) in 12 to 18 years old subjects, as mentioned in the current SmPC of 
Telzir. Only two cases of diarrhoea (2%) were considered drug-related in the youngest cohort, whereas 
18 cases (22%) were initially observed. However, it may be more difficult to impute Telzir as the cause of 
these diarrhoeas in the younger patients.  
Rash was reported, but is a known common adverse reaction of Telzir. Increased of ALAT/ASAT and 
cholesterol levels are also known common adverse reactions of Telzir. 
Neutropenia was commonly reported, but not considered drug-related and is probably due to concomitant 
medications (for example, 42% of subjects included in the study APV29005 received sulfamethoxazole + 
trimethoprim). 
Week 48 safety data from APV29005 and APV20002 
Like in the integrated safety data from studies APV29005 and APV20003, vomiting and diarrhoea were 
the most common AEs. Metabolic disorders (hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia) were also 
frequently observed, which is in accordance to the known safety profile of Telzir. 
Assessment report  
EMA/339053/2014 
Page 11/15 
  
  
 
 
Given the sequence of events, the death reported in 2-month-old male subject could be related to the 
gastroenteritis, which could be induced by Telzir and/or traditional herbal medicine. The role of Telzir in 
this death cannot be ruled out. 
Similarly as in the integrated safety data from studies APV29005 and APV20003, neutropenia cases are 
probably due to concomitant medications, and resolved without discontinuation of Telzir. No new 
laboratory abnormalities were observed. 
2.4.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed: 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
… 
Paediatric / other populations 
Children and  adolescents: The  adverse  reaction profile  in  children and  adolescents is  based  on  integrated 
safety data from two studies (APV29005 Week 24 data and APV20003 Week 168 data [final data]) in which 
126 158 HIV-1 infected subjects 2 to 18 years of age received fosamprenavir with ritonavir with background 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1 for information on dosing regimens applied 
for each age group). 7970 % of subjects received greater than 48 weeks of exposure. 
Overall the safety profile in these 158126 children and adolescents was similar to that observed in the adult 
population.  Vomiting occurred more frequently amongst paediatric patients. Drug-related adverse reactions 
were  more  common in  APV20003 (5557%)  where  subjects received  once  daily  fosamprenavir /  ritonavir 
when compared to APV29005 (3339%) where subjects received twice daily fosamprenavir / ritonavir. 
No  new  safety  concerns  were  identified  from  analyses  of  48  week  data  from  studies  APV29005  or 
APV20002, in which 54 subjects 4 weeks to <2 years of age received twice daily fosamprenavir / ritonavir 
with background nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy and 5 subjects received only single doses 
of fosamprenavir with or without ritonavir. 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
… 
Resistance 
In vivo 
a) ART-naïve or PI-naïve patients 
Various  regimens  have  been  assessed  in  the  amprenavir/fosamprenavir  development  programs  with  and 
without  co-administration  of  ritonavir.  Analysis  of  the  virological  failure  samples  across  these  regimens 
defined  four  main  resistance  pathways:  V32I+I47V,  I50V,  I54L/M  and  I84V.  Additional  mutations 
observed  which  may  contribute  to  resistance  were:  L10V/F/R,  I13V,  K20R/T,  L33F/V,  M36I,  M46I/L, 
I47V/L Q58E, I62V, L63P, V77I, I85V, and I93L. 
When  ART  naïve  adult  patients  were  treated  with  the  currently  approved  doses  of  fosamprenavir  / 
ritonavir, as for other ritonavir boosted PI regimens, the mutations described were infrequently observed. 
Sixteen  of  434  ART-naïve  patients  who  received  fosamprenavir  700mg/ritonavir  100mg  twice  daily  in 
ESS100732  experienced  virological failure  by  Week  48  with  14 isolates  genotyped. Three  of  14 isolates 
had  protease  resistance  mutations.  One  resistance  mutation  was  observed  in  each  of  3  isolates: K20K/R, 
I54I/L and I93I/L respectively 
Genotypic analysis of isolates from 13 of 14 paediatric patients exhibiting virological failure among the 59 
PI-naïve patients enrolled, demonstrated resistance patterns similar to those observed in adults.Among the 
81  PI-naïve  paediatric  patients  treated  with  fosamprenavir  /  ritonavir,  15  patients  met  protocol-defined 
Assessment report  
EMA/339053/2014 
Page 12/15 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
virological  failure  through  48  weeks  in  APV29005  and  up  to  108  weeks  in  APV20003.  Treatment-
emergent  major  or  APV-associated  protease  mutations  were  observed  in  virus  isolated  from  2  patients. 
Resistance patterns were similar to those observed in adults. 
b) PI-experienced patients 
Amprenavir 
In  the  studies  of  PI-experienced adult  patients,  PRO30017  (amprenavir  600  mg  /  ritonavir  100  mg  twice 
daily  in  sub-study  A  and  B  with  80  and  37  patients  respectively),  the  following  mutations  emerged  in 
patients with virological failure: L10F/I/V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I/L, I47V, 
G48V, I50V, I54L/M/T/V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A/I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L/M. 
Fosamprenavir 
In  the  studies  of  PI-experienced  adult  patients,  APV30003  and  its  extension,  APV30005  (fosamprenavir 
700 mg / ritonavir 100 mg twice daily: n=107), the following mutations emerged in patients experiencing 
virological  failure  through  96  weeks:  L10F/I,  L24I,  V32I,  L33F,  M36I,  M46I/L,  I47V,  I50V,  I54L/M/S, 
A71I/T/V, G73S, V82A, I84V, and L90M. 
In  the  paediatric  studies  APV20003  and  APV29005,  67  PI-experienced  patients  were  treated  with 
fosamprenavir  /  ritonavir  and  of  22  virological  failure  isolates  genotyped,  nine  patients  were  found  with 
treatment-emergent  protease  mutations.In  the  paediatric  studies  APV20003  and  APV29005,  77  PI-
experienced patients were treated with fosamprenavir / ritonavir-based regimens and 43 patients met study-
defined  virologic  failure  criteria  through  48  weeks  in  APV29005  and  up  to  108  weeks  in  APV20003. 
Treatment-emergent  major  protease or  APV-associated  mutations  were  observed  in  virus isolated  from  1 
patient in APV29005 and 6 patients from APV20003. The mutational profiles were 
similar to those described for PI-experienced adults treated with fosamprenavir / ritonavir. 
Antiviral activity according to genotypic/phenotypic resistance 
… 
Children and adolescent patients above the age of six 
Fosamprenavir tablets and oral suspension with ritonavir in combination with NRTIs have been evaluated 
in protease inhibitor naïve and experienced children and adolescent patients. The benefit in this age group 
has mainly been derived from the ongoing study, APV29005, an open label 48 week study evaluating the 
pharmacokinetic profiles, safety, and antiviral activity of fosamprenavir with ritonavir administered twice 
daily to HIV 1 protease inhibitor experienced and naive patients 2 to 18 years of age. Results through 24 48 
weeks of treatment are provided below. 
APV29005 enrolled 25 30 patients aged 6 to 11 (the majority of whom were treated with fosamprenavir / 
ritonavir 18/3 mg/kg twice daily or the adult tablet regimen), and 29 40 patients aged 12 to 18 (the majority 
of whom were treated with the adult tablet regimen). Overall, 27 (50 %) were PI-naïve, 9 of whom were 
ART  naïve,  and  27  (50  %)  were  PI-experienced.  Prior  NRTI  exposure  was  extensive,  with  median 
durations of 421 and 389 weeks for the PI naïve and experienced patients respectively. The median duration 
of  prior  PI  exposure  was  239  weeks.  Overall,  patients  enrolled  with  a  median  4.6  HIV-1  RNA  log10 
copies/ml (33 % of whom had > 100,000 copies/ml at baseline) and a median % CD4+ cell of 18 % (37 % 
of whom had % CD4+ of < 15% at baseline). 
Through  24  weeks  of  therapy,  70  %  (19/27)  of  protease  inhibitor  naive  and  56  %  (15/27)  of  protease 
inhibitor  experienced  patients  achieved  and  maintained  a  plasma  HIV  1  RNA  <400  copies/ml  (ITT(E), 
TLOVR).  In  the  ITT(E)  population  (Observed  analysis)  at  Week  24  the  median  %  CD4+  cell  counts 
increased by 8 % in the PI-naïve subjects and 4 % in the PI-experienced subjects.

Population 
During the procedure the CHMP requested that the following proposed change is not included, since the 
wording affected corresponds to a class labelling for all ARV products and a sufficient justification was not 
provided to deviate from class wording: 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune  Reactivation  Syndrome:  in  HIV-infected  patients  with  severe  immune  deficiency  at  the  time  of 
initiation  of  combination  antiretroviral  therapy  (CART),  an  inflammatory  reaction  to  asymptomatic  or 
residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease) have also been 
reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable 
and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which were 
reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, minor editorial changes are implemented in SmPC sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The changes proposed in the PI are based primarily on integrated safety from Study APV29005 (Week 24 
data) and Study APV20003 (Week 168 data), together with Week 48 data from Studies APV29005 and 
APV20002. These data demonstrate that RTV-boosted FPV was generally well-tolerated in children 4 
weeks to 18 years of age. No new safety concerns have been identified since the approval by the 
European Commission for use of FPV/RTV and other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV 
infection in children 6 years and above in 2007. 
The safety profile in paediatric patients is considered comparable to that of adults although vomiting 
occurred more frequently amongst paediatric patients. While neutropenia occurred more frequently in 
paediatric patients, an assessment of the cases suggests that most had a long time to onset and/or were 
confounded by concomitant, antiretroviral and antibacterial drug treatment commonly associated with 
neutropenia. Thus, the relationship of neutropenia to FPV use is considered unlikely.

Using the FDA-defined snapshot analysis, proportions of subjects in APV29005 achieving <400 copies/mL 
at Week 48 were 53% and 63% in the 6-<12 year olds and 12-18 year olds respectively, indicating an 
adequate antiviral response given that the population included PI-naïve and PI/ART-experienced subjects. 
An immunologic response, as indicated by increases in absolute CD4+ cell counts was demonstrated. As 
expected, the rate of virological failures is higher in PI-experienced subjects (56%) than PI-naïve subjects 
(19%). The mutational profile is similar between children and adults. 
The wording added to the SmPC following the analysis of the safety in studies APV29005, APV20003 and 
APV20002 in children respectively 2 to 18 years of age and 4 weeks to < 2 years of age is acceptable, 
even if data gathered in the children from 4 weeks to 2 years are very limited. The CHMP also agrees with 
the proposed update on antiviral activity in children, summarizing results of study APV29005 among 
subjects from 6 to 18 years old. Of note, results of children < 6 years old are not included since Telzir is 
not currently approved in this population. 
The benefit/risk balance of Telzir is unchanged and still positive. Data from studies APV29005, APV20002 
and APV20003 did not identify new safety concerns and new resistance patterns in paediatric subjects. 
The antiviral activity of Telzir and the immunological response in this population are acceptable and 
unchanged compared to the previous available data. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation requested 
C.I.4 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, 
preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Type 
II 
Update of SmPC sections 4.8 and 5.1 with additional information on safety, antiviral response and 
treatment resistance in HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects, based on results of studies previously 
submitted as post-authorisation measures. In addition, the Product information is being updated to the 
latest QRD template version and editorial changes are implemented in SmPC sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet.

Dupilumab (DUPIXENT®) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human interleukin 
(IL)-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) and blocks both human IL-4 (Type I & Type II) and human IL-13 (Type II) 
signal transduction. Dupilumab is being developed for atopic dermatitis (AD) in pediatric populations, 
following the approval in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Dupilumab has been approved in 
multiple regions for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. 
The ongoing pediatric clinical program has been designed to assess the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in 
patients 6 months to <18 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately 
controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies were not advisable.  
A Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for dupilumab, solution for injection, subcutaneous use, for the 
“treatment of atopic dermatitis” was submitted to the EMA on 31 July 2013 (EMEA-001501- PIP01-13).  The 
EMA issued a positive decision on 7 July 2014 (P/0169/2014) for the condition “treatment of atopic 
dermatitis”. 
• A waiver was granted for the paediatric population from birth to less than 6 months on the  grounds that 
the specific medicinal product is likely to be unsafe. 
• A deferral for one or more measures was granted for the paediatric population from 6 months to 18 years 
of age for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.  
Lastly, a request for PIP modification was submitted on 1st February 2018 and the EMA decision 
(P/0125/2018) was issued on 15 June 2018. 
The purpose of this application is to support a change in the target indication to include adolescents with 
moderate-to-severe AD based on the results from study R668-AD-1526 with patients aged ≥ 12 to <18 
years and supporting data from 3 other studies (R668-AD-1412; R668-AD1607; R668-AD-1434). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019

The proposed indication is: 
Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in patients aged 
12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, however an updated carcinogenicity report was 
provided in this application. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Toxicology 
Carcinogenicity 
The purpose of this amendment was to reflect an updated literature search cut-off date in support of 
subsequent marketing applications for the atopic dermatitis indication in adolescent (≥12 to <18 years of 
age) patients. 
A literature search for any articles published between October 1, 2017 and June 6, 2018 was performed, and 
no new publications were identified that would change the conclusions of the original document. No changes 
have been made to the original document. 
The conclusion stated in the original application remains the same. 
In summary, the weight-of-evidence for the available literature data related to IL-4Rα inhibition, and animal 
toxicology data with surrogate antibodies REGN1103 and REGN646, do not support an increased risk of 
cancer for dupilumab. Hence, the MAH maintains that no additional nonclinical studies are necessary to 
evaluate the carcinogenic potential of dupilumab. This is agreed by CHMP. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Dupilumab is a water soluble monoclonal antibody which undergoes extensive in vivo metabolism. The 
human excretion products of dupilumab are predicted to be rapidly and readily degraded in sewage 
collection and treatment systems and in the environment. Therefore, dupilumab is unlikely to result in a 
significant risk to the environment. Therefore according to Section 2 of the 2006 CHMP Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (ERA Guideline corr 2) dupixent is 
exempt from submission of an ERA. This is acceptable by CHMP. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
There are no updated non clinical data in this application that need assessment. 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The clinical development program of dupilumab in the treatment of adolescent AD comprises 4 clinical 
studies. R668-AD-1526 is the pivotal phase 3 monotherapy study in patients aged 12-18 years with 
moderate-to-severe AD not adequately controlled with currently available topical treatments. Supportive 
data are derived from a phase 2a, open-label pharmacokinetic (PK)/safety study  (R668-AD-1412), an 
pediatric open-label extension study (R668-AD-1434) and an open-label autoinjector (AI) study 
(R668-AD-1607, note: data assessed as part of the extension of indication in asthma). Thus, relevant 
patient exposure includes 292 adolescent patients stemming from studies R668-AD-1526, R668-AD-1412 
and R668-AD-1434. 
The clinical development program was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in adolescent 
patients with moderate-to-severe AD not adequately controlled with currently available topical treatments. 
The patient population comprised adolescents with AD, as defined by the American Academy of Dermatology 
Consensus Criteria (Eichenfield, 2004) (Eichenfield, 2014). These patients had moderate-to-severe AD 
lesions affecting a large portion of their body surface area (BSA). They experienced high levels of AD 
symptoms, including pruritus. Their disease could not be adequately controlled with topical prescription 
medications. This population included patients who had been, or would typically be, candidates for systemic 
AD therapies. Efficacy assessments included measurements of the extent and intensity of AD signs, severity 
of AD symptoms, the impact of AD on QOL, and anxiety and depression scores. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD have been included in 4 dupilumab clinical studies where 
PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) data have been collected (refer to Table 1). A variety of subcutaneous (SC) 
dosing regimens was evaluated in these studies including: 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg single dose or repeated QW 
dose, 200 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q2W, and 300 mg Q4W. 
The indication in adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD is based primarily on the phase 3 randomized 
controlled study R668-AD-1526 assessing efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adolescent patients; 
exposure-response (E-R) and PK data are presented to support the dosing regimen in adolescent patients. 
The proposed to-be-marketed dosing regimen for adolescents with AD is tiered by body weight with patients 
<60 kg receiving 200 mg Q2W following a 400 mg loading dose, and patients ≥ 60 kg receiving 300mg Q2W 
following a 600 mg loading dose (referred to as the 200/300 mg Q2W regimen). This tiered regimen was 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 10/147 
 
 
 
 
  
  
selected for the phase 3 pivotal trial, R668-AD-1526, using simulation from a population PK model based on 
phase 2 pediatric data with the aim of bridging the dupilumab exposure distribution in adolescent patients to 
that achieved with the standard 300 mg Q2W regimen in adults. 
With respect to PK, in the current application the distribution of trough concentrations was assessed at week 
16 for the 200/300 mg Q2W versus the 300 mg Q4W regimens. The nature of PK sampling varied from dense 
sampling in the R668-AD-1607 study, to semi-dense sampling in the R668-AD-1412 study, to sparse 
sampling in the R668-AD-1434 and R668-AD-1526 studies

Bioanalytical methods 
Determination of functional dupilumab 
The quantitative measurement of functional dupilumab was conducted using the validated enzyme linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method REGN668-AV-13074-VA-01V2. This method was already described 
and assessed during the original AD marketing application. 
Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) for the functional dupilumab assay was performed in R668-AD-1021 (to 
support adult population in the R668-AD-1607 study) and in R668-AD-1412 to support the pediatric 
population in the current submission. The data for the ISRs of the R668-AD-1021 and R668-AD-1412 studies 
are provided in their respective sample bioanalytical reports (BARs). ISR passing rate (reanalysis results 
within ±30% variability of the original result) in study R668-AD-1021 was 88.7% and ISR passing rate in 
study R668-AD-1412 was 90.8%. Thus, all ISRs performed met acceptance criteria, indicating that the 
assays generated robust data in both the adult (R668-AD-1607 Part A) and the pediatric (R668-AD-1412, 
R668-AD-1434, and R668-AD-1526) study populations.

The method applied for the detection of functional dupilumab appears to correspond to the method used in 
the initial marketing authorization application for AD and this method has been accurately validated 
(REGN668-AV-13074).  
Additional data analyses were included in the amended validation report (REGN668-AV-13112-VA-01V2) 
submitted in the marketing application for asthma. Updates to this method included modification of the 
assay cut point using a 1% false positive rate. 
Clinical studies with collection of PK and PD data 
Study R668-AD-1412 
The PK of dupilumab in the pediatric population were first evaluated in pediatric patients with 
moderate-to-severe AD following single and repeated dose of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg. The concentration-time 
profiles for functional dupilumab in serum suggest concentration dependent elimination, consistent with 
target-mediated drug disposition. Dupilumab concentrations were typically more than 2-fold greater 
following 4 mg/kg SC than 2 mg/kg SC. Overall, the PK profile of dupilumab in these pediatric AD patients is 
generally consistent with that observed in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. 
Study R668-AD-1526 
In the phase 3 study, adolescent patients with AD were treated with dupilumab 200/300 mg Q2W (tiered by 
body weight) or 300 mg Q4W, administered via a prefilled syringe (PFS). The choice of dose was based on 
R668-AD-1412 and 200 mg <60 kg and 300 mg >=60 kg with the aim of achieving a single normalized 
exposure across this patient population. 
The study consisted of 3 periods: screening of up to 5 weeks, treatment period of 16 weeks, and follow-up 
of 12 weeks. Samples for assessment of drug concentrations were collected on days 1, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, 
and 197 and samples for ADA on days 1, 29, 113, and 197. 
Systemic concentrations of dupilumab appeared to achieve steady state at or before week 12 (see figure 
below). Using the week 16 dupilumab concentrations as a representation of steady state, the mean steady 
state trough concentrations were approximately 3-fold higher for the 200 mg/300 mg Q2W regimen 
compared to the 300 mg Q4W regimen (54.5±27.0 mg/L vs 19.8±15.9 mg/L).

Note:  all concentrations are trough concentrations except week 2 in the Q4W dose group. 
For the Q2W regimen, similar exposure was achieved for patients <60 kg who received 200 mg compared to 
patients ≥60 kg who received 300 mg. As expected when administering the same dosing regimen across all 
body weights, the 300 mg Q4W regimen resulted in lower Ctrough in patients ≥60 kg as compared to patients 
<60 kg. Overall, a larger number of adolescent patients receiving the Q4W regimen showed week 16 
Ctrough of dupilumab at or near the LLOQ (0.078 mg/L).  
There is no clear evidence of a clinically meaningful impact of immunogenicity on dupilumab exposure. 
Anti-drug antibody/NAb-positive patients exhibited individual concentration-time profiles in the range of 
ADA/NAb-negative patients for the 200 mg/300 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q4W regimens. Scatter plots of the 
continuous endpoints, EASI and NRS percent change from baseline, show that the efficacy profiles of 
ADA/NAb-positive patients fall within the distribution of ADA/NAb-negative patients receiving the 200 
mg/300 mg Q2W regimen. Inspection of individual profiles of NAb-positive adolescent patients showed that 
there was no clear association between ADA/NAb positivity, drug concentration, and drug effect. 
Study R668-AD-1434 
Study R668-AD-1434 is an open-label extension (OLE) study in pediatric patients who had previously 
enrolled in other dupilumab pediatric AD studies. Samples for drug concentration assessments for the 
patients ≥12 years to <18 years were collected on days 1, 113, 365, 533, 729, 1065, 1401, and 1821. Only 
results from adolescent patients ≥12 years to <18 years of age are reported here. Samples for ADA analysis 
were collected at baseline, and weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 for patients recruited from parent study 
R668-AD-1412 and for patients recruited from R668-AD-1607 and R668-AD-1526, samples were collected 
at baseline and week 16. 
At the time of the data cut-off for this report, a total of 275 patients aged ≥12 to <18 years from parent 
studies R668-AD-1412, R668-AD-1526, and R668-AD-1607 were included in the study. 
Adolescent patients receiving a 2 mg/kg QW regimen achieved mean steady state trough concentration at 
week 48 of 73 mg/L versus 161 mg/L (approximately 2-fold higher) for the 4 mg/kg QW regimen. 
The mean concentration of dupilumab at week 16 in adolescent patients from parent studies R668-AD-1526 
and R668-AD-1607 who received 300 mg Q4W in R668-AD-1434 was 15.9 mg/L. In those adolescent

patients who were up-titrated to 200 mg/300 mg Q2W due to inadequate response, mean Ctrough at week 
16 was approximately 45 mg/L. 
A summary of adolescent patients enrolled into study R688-AD-1434 from previous studies is provided in 
Table 6. 
A high proportion of patients were White (69.5%) and male (58.9%), but other races and ethnicities were 
adequately represented. The mean (SD) age of patients was 14.6 ±1.7 years. More than 40% of patients 
were overweight (BMI ≥85 percentile for age and gender). 
Adolescent patients receiving a 2 mg/kg QW regimen achieved mean steady-state trough concentration of 
73 mg/L at week 48 versus 161 mg/L (approximately 2-fold higher) for the 4 mg/kg QW regimen (Figure 
18). The mean trough concentration of dupilumab at week 16 in adolescent patients from parent studies 
R668-AD-1526 and R668-AD-1607 who received 300 mg Q4W in R668-AD-1434 was 15.9 mg/L (Table 35). 
In those adolescent patients who were up-titrated to 200 mg/300 mg Q2W due to inadequate response, 
mean trough concentration at week 16 was approximately 55 mg/L. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

In those adolescent patients who were up-titrated to the proposed to-be-marketed 200 mg/300 mg Q2W 
regimen  for  adolescents,  mean  trough  concentration  at  week  16  was  approximately  45 mg/L.  However, 
there  was  considerable  variability  in  trough  concentrations  at  week  16  in  adolescents  receiving  the 
weight-tiered 200 mg/300 mg Q2W dosing regimen (CV% 41.7-51.6%). 
Study EFC13579 (Asthma) 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 17/147 
 
 
  
  
Study EFC13579 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi-national study, 
using dupilumab or placebo as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids in combination with one or 2 other 
controller medicines (eg, LABA, long-acting muscarinic antagonists [LAMAs], leukotriene receptor 
antagonist [LTRA], methylxanthines) in the treatment of patients aged ≥12 years with persistent asthma. 
Following SC administration of dupilumab, Ctrough values increased with each subsequent dose 
administration until week 12 to 16 when steady state appeared to have been achieved. The steady state 
exposure increase from 200 mg Q2W to 300 mg Q2W was slightly greater than dose proportional in adults, 
suggesting that saturation of the target-mediated elimination may not have been completely achieved in all 
patients at the 200 mg Q2W dose level. Mean dupilumab exposure was higher in adolescents than adults, as 
a consequence of lower mean body weight, but was well within the safety exposure margin established in 
adults at 300 mg QW. 
Population PK modelling 
The population PK model utilizing the parameter estimates from the original marketing application for adults 
with moderate-to-severe AD was used to predict the concentration-time course in adolescents after 
administration of Q2W and Q4W regimens and the results compared to the observed adolescent data from 
study R668-AD-1526. A 2-compartment population PK model with parallel linear and nonlinear 
(Michaelis-Menten) elimination was used. A transit-compartment model was used to describe the absorption 
phase.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 18/147 
 
  
  
Subsequently, the adult PK model structure was fitted to the adolescent data, whereby some parameters of 
the model were re-estimated using only data from the adolescent study R668-AD-1526, including 
target-mediated elimination (Vm), together with inter-patient variability for this parameter. This 
modification was implemented to optimize prediction of values below the level of quantitation and the 
target-mediated phase of the PK profile in the adolescent patients. The statistically significant covariates 
identified in adults were tested to confirm their significance in the adolescent population.

EMA/463030/2019 
Page 19/147 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The table 3 below shows the parameter estimated for the final covariate model, based on the adolescent 
data from study R668-AD-1526 and the previously estimated values for adults. Covariates were 
incorporated into the model or rejected based on forward inclusion (p= 0.05) and backward elimination (p= 
0.005) criteria.  
In adolescent patients, the covariate coefficients for ADA, body mass index (BMI), EASI score, and weight 
were statistically significant and similar to those in the adult model. The effects of albumin on central volume 
and race on elimination rate in adults were not replicated in adolescents, possibly due to a considerably 
smaller sample size. Population PK parameters were essentially the same in the base and covariate 
adolescent models. Both base and covariate adult Pop PK models were replicated with small and 
inconsequential numeric differences in population PK parameters.

Model diagnostics (base and final model) 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 20/147 
 
  
  
Diagnostic plots show a good model fit with some imperfections in predicted BLQ frequencies and simulated 
concentrations for the BLQ values.  
VPC demonstrated good predictability, ie median observed concentrations of dupilumab were within 
predicted confidence intervals.  
Shrinkage in variance of ETAs for ke and V2 was 21.9% and 51.4%, respectively, in the base model. The 
corresponding shrinkage in SD was ~12% and ~30%. In the final model, shrinkage was 25.3% and 54.3% 
in variance of ETAs for ke and V2 respectively. The corresponding shrinkage in SD of ETA is ~14% and 
~32%. 
VPC plots indicate a slight under-prediction following 300 mg Q2W treatment. Overall model diagnostics 
showed no major model deficiencies indicating that the population PK model describes the data acceptably 
well.  
In this line it is noticed that Omega (V2) estimated from the final model is wider compared to Omega (V2) 
estimated from the base model which is considered not plausible. In addition, shrinkage on V2 was high 
(54.3%) and also rises from the base to the final pop PK model. Thus, the MAH was asked to justify covariate 
selection. This is further addressed later on in the discussion part.  
Overall, it is agreed that the base and covariate PK models adequately described the PK of dupilumab in 
adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Diagnostic plots for both base and covariate models 
showed an acceptable fit. Bootstrapping validated the parameter estimates. 
To support the adequacy of the proposed dosing regimen for adolescents, the applicant was asked to 
conduct simulations to show the probability of attaining the recommended target concentration/exposure 
for efficacy, over the body weight distribution observed in adolescent patients, when receiving the proposed 
to-be-marketed weight-tiered 200 mg/300 mg Q2W dosing regimen as well as the 300 mg Q4W regimen.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 21/147 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The PK parameters estimated for the adolescent patients were used to calculate the Cmax, Cmin, and AUC 
values after the first dose and at steady state for the proposed dosing regimen 200 mg and 300mg Q2W, as 
well as for 300mg Q4W. 
Simulated exposure to Dupilumab by treatment regimens supports the chosen 60 kg threshold for 
differential dosing (200 mg < 60kg; 300 mg ≥ 60 kg).  
Absorption 
In the adult AD patient population, dupilumab is well absorbed with a reported bioavailability of 64%. 
Bioavailability (F) seems not to be re-estimated in the adolescent population and is fixed to the population 
value estimated from the adult population.  
Bioequivalence 
Dupilumab drug product at the 300 mg strength has already been approved for AD and consists of a 150 
mg/mL solution in a pre-filled syringe (PFS) with or without needle shield. The proposed to-be-marketed 
drug product at 200 mg strength in the current application is a 175 mg/mL solution with 2 presentations, a 
PFS with needle shield or a PFS assembled into a pre-filled pen (PFP), also referred to as autoinjector (AI). 
Of the two presentations, the dupilumab 200 mg PFS was used for clinical studies in asthma, for which an 
extension of indication and extension of application to include the new 200 mg strength 
(EMEA/H/C/004390/X/04/G) was recently approved. The proposed to-be-marketed 200 mg PFP is 
assembled with the same bulk PFS (without plunger rod) and contains the same dupilumab drug substance, 
same drug formulation, and same solution volume for injection as the PFS used in the asthma pivotal 
studies. The potential effect of drug product presentation (PFP or PFS) on dupilumab PK and safety was 
evaluated in an actual-use study in patients with AD (Study R668-AD-1607). Study R668-AD-1607 is a 
2-part study with Part A conducted for the 200 mg dupilumab dose and Part B for the 300 mg dupilumab 
dose; as such only Part A results are presented. 
Study R668-AD-1607 (Part A) 
Study R668-AD-1607 was an open-label, randomized, actual use study of dupilumab PFP (referred to as an 
AI device in the study protocol) in adult and adolescent patients with AD. The study was conducted in 2 
parts: Part A and Part B. The primary objective of Part A was to assess technical performance of the 1 mL 
(200 mg dose) PFP. The primary objective of Part B was to assess technical performance of the 2 mL (300 
mg dose) PFP. Results from Part B are not presented in this document and will be submitted for review at a 
later date. In Part A, 85 patients were randomized to receive dupilumab 200 mg Q2W via PFP device or PFS, 
with a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1. Of the 85 patients enrolled in Part A, 18 were adolescents, of which

8 received dupilumab using the PFP and 10 using PFS. Randomization was stratified by Day 1 injection site 
(abdomen, upper thighs, or upper arms) and by weight category (≤70 kg, >70 to <100 kg, and ≥100 kg).  
The geometric mean ratios of dupilumab exposure with 90% CIs were calculated after first dose and at 
steady state. This study was not powered to demonstrate bioequivalence. 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
Following repeated q2w administration of dupilumab at 200 mg, the AUC0-14, Cmax and Ctrough values 
were comparable at steady state (Table 6 below). The geometric mean ratios (90% CI) for AUC0-14 
(PFP/PFS) were 0.903 (0.767 to 1.063) after the seventh dose on Day 85, with similar geometric mean ratios 
observed for Cmax and Ctrough (Table 7). After the loading dose administration on Day 1, geometric mean 
ratios (PFP/PFS, 90% CI) for Cmax and AUC0-14 were 0.741 (0.655 to 0.839) and 0.723 (0.635 to 0.823), 
respectively. The PK in these adolescent patients was similar for the 2 devices and consistent with that 
observed in adults. 
The site of injection did not appear to have a meaningful influence on dupilumab exposure for either the PFS 
or the PFP. Neither weight nor injection site had an impact on the comparison of PFP and PFS. Taking the 
data in totality, concentrations of functional dupilumab in serum were similar when administered using the 
PFP and PFS (200 mg devices). Minor differences were within the observed variability of exposure across the 
program. The study was not powered for bioequivalence.

The to-be-marketed 200 mg PFP is assembled with the same bulk PFS and contains the same dupilumab 
drug substance, same drug formulation, and same solution volume for injection as the PFS which was used 
in the asthma pivotal studies. In Study R668-AD-1607, the potential effect of drug product presentation (PFP 
or PFS) on dupilumab PK was investigated. In Part A of this study, patients with moderate to severe AD 
received dupilumab 200 mg q2w via PFP device or PFS, with a loading dose of 400 mg on Day 1. The study 
was not formally powered to show PK comparability/bioequivalence between PFS and PFP. The comparison 
of systemic dupilumab exposure between PFS and PFP was included as secondary objective in the study.  
The geometric mean ratio for AUC(0-14) was 0.723 (90% CI: 0.635-0.823) at study day 1 and 0.903 (90% 
CI: 0.767-1.063) at study day 85 (steady state). The geometric mean ratio for Cmax was 0.741 (90% CI: 
0.655-0.839) at study day 1 and 0.890 (90% CI: 0.779-1.017) at study day 85 (steady state). At both time 
points the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratios for AUC(0-14) and Cmax were not 
contained within the acceptance interval of 0.8 – 1.25 
The comparison of the two presentations was discussed during procedure EMEA/H/C/004390/X/04/G 
(extension application for asthma and adults and adolescents). The PFP comparability is considered 
acceptable as this issue has been resolved. 
Distribution 
Estimation of the central compartment volume of distribution (V2) yielded similar values for adolescents vs. 
adults (2.54±0.0473 vs. 2.76±0.021 L, respectively). 
Elimination 
Clearance was calculated to 0.128 L/d, derived from population PK. 
Derived values for clearance for the adolescent population (0.128 L/d) and adult population (0.130 L/d) are 
deemed comparable 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies

proportionality, steady-state and accumulation. 
Special populations 
Covariates (Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors) Affecting Pharmacokinetics 
Body Weight 
Since weight is the primary covariate affecting the PK of dupilumab, a tiered weight-based regimen was used 
to normalize exposure across the adolescent population. The mean week-16 dupilumab concentrations and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

distribution following the 2-tier weight-based 200/300 mg Q2W regimen for patients below and above 60 kg 
is depicted below.  
In contrast, as would be expected when the same dose was administered across the entire range of body 
weights, lower trough concentrations were observed at the higher weight category of ≥60 kg compared to 
the <60 kg weight category for the 300 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W) regimen.  
Age 
Population PK analysis in adolescent patients shows that, once weight is accounted for, age in the adolescent 
range (12 to 18 years) is not a statistically significant covariate and has no effect on PK of dupilumab in AD.

Disease Activity (EASI Scores) 
Based on the population PK analysis, baseline Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score had a 
statistically significant association with the PK of dupilumab in adolescents, as was observed in adults; 
patients with more severe disease at baseline exhibit lower exposure, although the association of baseline 
EASI alone on exposure was not clinically meaningful.  
PK comparison across populations 
The PK of dupilumab is characterized as nonlinear with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination pathways 
(target-mediated clearance), with the target-mediated pathway expressing a high degree of nonlinearity. As 
noted in the initial application and the subsequent asthma application, body weight has been identified as 
the single most influential covariate that described the variability in dupilumab exposure. As such, an 
emphasis was placed on presenting and comparing the observed PK of dupilumab in adolescents to adults as 
well as a weight normalized comparison. This latter approach was accomplished using a population PK 
approach. 
Comparison of the mean concentration-time profiles of functional dupilumab illustrates a high degree of 
consistency in exposure across the studies conducted using similar dosing regimens in adult and adolescent 
patients with AD. Any difference in exposure between adult and pediatric patients is likely accounted for by 
differences in body weight. In addition to comparisons between adolescent and adult patients with AD, the 
PK profiles of functional dupilumab were compared between adolescent patients with AD and asthma. 
Dupilumab Drug Concentrations in Adolescent and Adult Patients with Atopic Dermatitis or Asthma 
Data from studies in pediatric patients treated with dupilumab dosing regimens of either 200 mg Q2W or 300 
mg Q2W (R668-AD-1607, EFC13579, R668-AD-1526, R668-AD- 1434) are compared with results from 
studies in adult patients treated with the same dupilumab dosing regimens (R668-AD-1021, R668-AD-1334, 
R668-AD-1416). 
The time to steady state for dupilumab was previously reported as 10 weeks and 12 weeks following QW and 
Q2W regimens, respectively. Based on these findings, Ctrough at various time points beyond week 12 can be 
used as a reasonable approximation of the steady state concentrations and thus compared across studies. 
As shown in the table 4 below, the observed CtroughSS values for the Q2W regimen in adolescent patients 
are within the range of the CtroughSS values for the 300 mg Q2W regimen in adults.

This similarity in dupilumab exposure between adolescents and adult is illustrated graphically for the 
200/300 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q2W, and Q4W treatment regimens, respectively. 
It is agreed that detectable differences in mean dupilumab exposure between adolescents and adult are not 
considered major given the overall high variability in data which is supported by population PK analysis.

However, in the asthma population, Ctrough (60.2 mg/L) in the adolescent population was higher compared 
to the adult population (36.5 mg/mL) following 200 mg Q2W with an overall a trend of higher exposure in the 
adolescent population.   
Comparison of Dupilumab PK in Adolescent Patients with Asthma or AD 
A comparison of the Q2W regimens between adolescent patients with AD (R668-AD-1526) and asthma 
(EFC13579) is depicted below. The 200 mg Q2W regimens in adolescent patients <60 kg were similar 
between the 2 disease populations as were the 300 mg Q2W regimens in adolescents ≥60 kg. 
The mean dupilumab concentration reached following 200 mg Q2W was more comparable than mean 
concentration following 300 mg when opposing AD and Asthma adolescent patients.

Model-Based Comparison of Dupilumab PK in Adolescent and Adult Patients with AD 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dupilumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin-G4 (IgG4) antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and 
interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling by specifically binding to the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) sub-unit shared 
by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. 
Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor (IL 4Rα/γc), and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling 
through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα). Blocking IL-4Rα with dupilumab inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 
cytokine- induced responses, including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and IgE. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
LDH 
The time course of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was analyzed as a biomarker of AD disease severity over 
time. Although measured as part of standard chemistry panels for safety monitoring, LDH also serves as a 
PD marker of efficacy in AD. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 29/147 
 
  
  
The pharmacodynamics of LDH shows similar effects of dupilumab between adolescent and adult AD 
patients. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all monoclonal antibodies, dupilumab has the potential to induce ADAs. Therefore, serum samples 
for immunogenicity assessment were collected from all studies and titer levels were provided for the ADA 
positive samples. Samples that were positive in the ADA assay were also examined for neutralizing activity. 
The randomized controlled phase 3 study R668-AD-1526 was the primary source for the immunogenicity 
assessment of dupilumab in adolescents with AD, as it was the largest well-controlled study performed with 
the proposed to-be-marketed dosing regimen (200mg/300mg Q2W). The open-label, long-term extension 
study, R668-AD-1434, allowed additional monitoring of ADA positive patients and provided insights into 
responses over time, especially in those patients who had previously participated in the phase 2 study 
R668-AD-1412.  
The ADA status and category of each patient was classified as one of the following: 
•  Negative - If all samples are found to be negative in the ADA assay, or if the baseline sample is 
positive and all post baseline ADA titers are reported as less than 4-fold the baseline titer value 
• 
• 
Treatment-boosted - A positive result at baseline in the ADA assay with at least 1 post baseline titer 
result ≥4-fold the baseline titer value 
Treatment-emergent - A negative result or missing result at baseline with at least 1 positive post 
baseline result in the ADA assay 
o  Persistent - A positive result in the ADA assay detected in at least 2 consecutive post 
baseline samples separated by at least a 12-week post baseline period [based on nominal 
sampling time], with no ADA-negative results in-between, regardless of any missing 
samples 
o 
Indeterminate - A positive result in the ADA assay at the last collection time point only, 
regardless of any missing samples 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 30/147 
 
  
  
o  Transient - Not persistent or indeterminate, regardless of any missing samples 
In addition, the maximum response titers for each patient are categorized as High/Moderate/Low: 
• 
Low (titer <1,000) 
•  Moderate (1,000≤ titer ≤10,000) 
•  High (titer >10,000) 
Study R668-AD-1412 (Phase 2a) 
Sampling for the assessment of ADA was performed at screening (day -1), days 15, 29, and 57, and then 
follow-up on days 99 and 141 (end of study), or at early termination. 
In this study, adolescent patients received a single dose of dupilumab (2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg). There was an 
8-week delay in the second dose to allow sufficient time to characterize the PK profile, as this was unknown 
at the time. This was followed by 4 weekly doses of dupilumab QW. This regimen of a single dose, followed 
by an 8-week pause and then followed by repetitive dosing invoked a significant ADA response. In this study, 
a treatment-emergent ADA response was observed in 29 patients (72.5%), 20 of which (50% of total 40 
patients) were categorized as having a persistent, treatment-emergent response. The majority (23/29, 
79.3%) of the treatment-emergent positive responses in the ADA assay were categorized as low titer. 
However, in 6 patients this treatment regimen resulted in high or moderate titer responses in the ADA assay 
that were associated with a substantial reduction in detectable drug concentrations (Figure 14). Notably, in 
4 of these patients continued treatment through Part B of the study and, subsequently, the OLE study, 
resulted in declining titers and a corresponding increase in systemic concentrations of dupilumab (Figure 14) 
(2 of the remaining adolescent patients with moderate/high titer were not included in this analysis as they 
did not contribute any longitudinal concentration/ADA titer data in R668-AD-1434 at the time of interim data 
cutoff). The conclusion from these data is that a single dose of dupilumab followed, after 8 weeks (a 
prolonged pause), by a rechallenge led to a “prime and boost” immune response to dupilumab. However, 
should such a situation occur and efficacy decline, continued dupilumab treatment may allow for improved 
efficacy over time. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 31/147 
  
  
It is notable that during the development of dupilumab in the adult AD population, various intervals of 
treatment interval prolongation were assessed as patients rolled into the OLE study from other various 
parent studies. Although less frequent dosing of dupilumab was associated with a greater frequency of ADA 
than weekly dosing, these regimens did not produce the high frequencies and high titers of ADA seen with 
the "prime and boost" regimen used in the R668-AD-1412 study. As opposed to the gap in treatment in 
adolescents after a single dose, in the adult program, many patients had a gap of treatment of >8 weeks 
after at least 16 weeks of treatment between the initial study and entry into an extension study. This gap 
was not associated with the types of ADA responses induced by the "prime and boost" regimen used in the 
1412 study. Moreover, this high incidence of treatment-emergent ADA seen in R668-AD-1412 was not seen 
in R668-AD-1526 where adolescent patients were treated continuously for 16 weeks. The totality of these 
data suggest that the enhanced formation of ADA in part B of the R668-AD-1412 study in adolescent study 
is due to the study design rather than the population (adolescents vs adults). 
Study R668-AD-1526 (Phase 3) 
Samples for assessment of ADA were collected on days 1, 29, 113, and 197. 
Including results from the week 4 ADA time point, which was not evaluated in earlier studies, the incidence 
of treatment-emergent ADA response in the 200 mg/300 mg Q2W group was 16% versus 3.5% for the 
placebo group and 20.7% for the 300 mg Q4W group. However, most of the treatment-emergent responses 
for active doses were transient in nature and had low ADA titer, with no high titers observed. Only a few 
patients exhibited persistent treatment-emergent ADA responses (2.5% for 200 mg/300 mg Q2W, 1.2% for 
the placebo group, Table 5 and Table 6 below).

In order to allow for integration of these data with other dupilumab studies that did not include an analysis 
of ADA at week 4, an assessment of ADA was also conducted with the immunogenicity sampling at week 4 
censored. With the censoring of these data at week 4, treatment-emergent ADA were observed in 9.9%, 
12.2%, and 3.5% of patients in the 200 mg/300 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q4W, and placebo treatment groups, 
respectively. Neutralizing antibody positivity was unaffected. 
There is no clear evidence of a clinically meaningful impact of immunogenicity on dupilumab exposure. 
Anti-drug antibody/NAb-positive patients exhibited individual concentration-time profiles in the range of 
ADA/NAb-negative patients for the 200 mg/300 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q4W regimens. Scatter plots of the 
continuous endpoints, EASI and NRS percent change from baseline, show that the efficacy profiles of 
ADA/NAb-positive patients fall within the distribution of ADA/NAb-negative patients receiving the 200 
mg/300 mg Q2W regimen. Inspection of individual profiles of NAb-positive adolescent patients showed that 
there was no clear association between ADA/NAb positivity, drug concentration, and drug effect. However, 
one patient in the 300 mg Q2W dose group, who exhibited persistent ADA with moderate titers and was also 
positive in the NAb assay, had lower drug concentrations, which reached the LLOQ by week 8 (Figure 31). 
Another patient in the 300 mg Q2W dose group who exhibited persistent ADA with low titers and was also 
positive in the NAb assay, showed lower drug concentrations up to week 16, followed by an increase (Figure 
31).

Study R668-AD-1434 (Phase 3) 
Samples for ADA analysis were collected at baseline, and weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48for patients recruited 
from parent study R668-AD-1412 and for patients recruited from R668-AD-1607 and R668-AD-1526, 
samples were collected at baseline and week 16. 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent ADA in R668-AD-1434 was 26.5% and the responses were 
mostly transient and of low titer. The overall incidence of persistent ADA was 5.9%. Three (2.2%) high titer 
responses were observed (2 of the patients from study R668-AD-1412 who initially received a 2 mg/kg QW 
dose and one from study R668-AD-1526). Three (2.2%) moderate responses were observed in patients who 
received a 4 mg/kg QW regimen from parent study R668-AD-1412.

The distribution of dupilumab concentrations for ADA positive patients was generally in the range of 
concentrations of ADA-negative patients with the exception of a few patients with high/moderate ADA titers. 
Some patients from R668-AD-1412 who entered this OLE study with moderate or high titers exhibited a 
decrease in titer values over time with a corresponding increase in systemic dupilumab concentrations. 
Association of immunogenicity and concentrations of functional dupilumab 
The  distribution  of  dupilumab  concentrations  for  ADA-positive  patients  was  generally  in  the  range  of 
concentrations of ADA-negative patients with the exception of a few patients with moderate/high ADA titers. 
Closer inspection of both the dupilumab serum concentration and ADA titer time courses of 4 patients with 
high or moderate ADA titers showed the ADA titers increase from the start of study R668-AD-1412, where 
there was a single dose period (8 weeks) followed by a multiple dose period (4 doses administered QW). As 
the  ADA  titres  reached  moderate  or  high,  dupilumab  concentration  decreased  to  the  LLOQ.  Longitudinal 
assessment of these patients revealed that, with continued treatment over time, ADA titer values declined 
(some to negative ADA status) with a corresponding increase in dupilumab concentrations to that expected 
for  the  treatment  regimen.  This  return  to  a  typical  dupilumab  concentration  generally  correlated  with  a 
greater percent reduction for baseline EASI (Figure 19). 
The 2 remaining adolescent patients with moderate/high titer were not included in this analysis as they did 
not contribute longitudinal concentration/ADA titer data in this study at the time of interim data cut-off.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-Response Analysis 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses were conducted for adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD focusing 
solely on efficacy and concentration data from the randomized placebo-controlled pivotal study 
R668-AD-1526 in adolescents. 
The primary study endpoint, the percentage of patients achieving an IGA score of 0 or 1, as well as the 
secondary endpoint, mean (standard deviation [SD]) percent EASI change from baseline, over time by 
quartile of functional dupilumab concentration was assessed. This was based on data from the 200/300 mg 
Q2W and 300 mg Q4W regimens of study R668-AD-1526 to explore any E-R relationships. The number of 
patients in each quartile and time point is shown as well as the percentage of patients receiving the 200/300 
mg Q2W dose in each quartile over time. Unlike the analysis in the initial application, this analysis includes

Page 39/147 
 
  
  
various imputation methods to account for the effect of censored data due to dropout, as well as a completer 
analysis.  
Two imputation methods were employed for the categorical variable of IGA: a primary method whereby 
missing data were treated as non-responders and a second method, which utilized an LOCF approach for 
data imputation. Two imputation methods were also employed for the continuous variable of EASI percent 
change from baseline; LOCF and worst observation carried forward (WOCF). 
For missing concentration data from 16 patients, 87% of samples occurred between week 8 and week 16, ie, 
at or close to steady state. To impute these missing data, the last measured concentration was carried 
forward in all quartile analyses. 
In addition to quartile analysis, logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between 
probability of achieving an IGA score 0 or 1, EASI-50, EASI-75, and EASI-90 with Ctrough at week 16.  
A logistic regression analysis was also conducted to assess the relationship between the probability of 
developing conjunctivitis and Ctrough at week 16.  
Per protocol, approximately 240 patients were to be randomized to receive placebo or dupilumab (200 mg 
Q2W, 300 mg Q2W, or 300 mg Q4W). In actuality, a total of 251 patients were randomized (full analysis set) 
in a ratio of 1:1:1 to the placebo, Q4W, or Q2W SC treatment regimens (85:83:82, respectively). Of the 251 
patients, 250 patients received at least one dose of placebo or study drug and were included in the safety 
analysis set. Patients (n = 43) with baseline weight <60 kg received 200 mg dupilumab Q2W SC, and 
patients (n = 39) with baseline weight ≥60 kg received 300 mg dupilumab Q2W SC. 
Of the 250 patients in the safety analysis set, 249 patients were included in the PK analysis set. As patients 
were able to enroll in an open-label extension study at or after the end of treatment (week 16), a total of 10 
patients had samples for PK analysis at the last visit (week 28). 
A total of 1511 serum samples had a reportable result upon analysis for concentrations of functional 
dupilumab. Of the samples from dupilumab-treated patients (including prestudy samples), 77.9% had 
quantifiable functional dupilumab concentrations. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 40/147 
 
 
 
  
  
For the concentration/exposure-response analysis set, 245, 245, and 247 patients in the PK analysis set also 
had one baseline and at least one post dose EASI, IGA, and pruritus NRS score, respectively. In the placebo 
group, 5 samples had quantifiable dupilumab concentration. These results from the placebo group did not 
affect the ability to interpret the results of this study. 
Of the 250 patients in the safety analysis set, 248 patients were included in the ADA and Nab analysis sets. 
A total of 760 serum samples were available for analysis of ADA and NAb. 
Results 
• 
E-R analysis regarding efficacy 
Exposure-response relationships via quartile analysis, where identified, revealed increasing drug effects 
with increasing serum trough concentration. Specifically, the percent of adolescent patients achieving the 
primary endpoint (IGA score of 0 or 1) increased with increasing quartile of functional dupilumab 
concentration. A similar trend was observed for EASI, where increasing percent change from baseline EASI 
scores was associated with increasing quartiles of dupilumab concentrations. As expected, the percent of 
patients achieving a given response with the 200/300 mg Q2W relative to the 300 mg Q4W dosing regimen 
increased with increasing quartiles of concentration. Results of the completer analysis and other imputation 
methods demonstrated that the rank ordering of concentration quartiles was preserved for the E-R 
relationships of both IGA and percent EASI change from baseline (see figures below).

Logistic regression plots on binary efficacy endpoints including IGA 0 or 1, EASI-90, EASI-75, and EASI-50 
also supported higher probability of response at higher exposures, which corresponded to the Q2W regimen. 
The p-values were significant for the inclination of the regression lines of these relationships, with a higher 
degree of significance observed on the more stringent efficacy endpoints, IGA 0 or 1 and EASI-90, compared 
to EASI-75 and EASI-50 (see figures below).

The data show a positive dupilumab concentration-response relationship for efficacy measures of IGA and 
EASI in adolescents with moderate-severe atopic dermatitis.  
Exposure-response relationships by quartile of dupilumab concentration showed increasing drug effects with 
increasing  trough  concentration  over  time  for  efficacy  endpoints  IGA  score  of  0  to  1  and  EASI.  The 
percentage of patients receiving the 200 mg/300 mg Q2W regimen was greatest in the highest quartiles of 
dupilumab concentration (Q3 and Q4). 
Logistic regression plots on binary efficacy endpoints EASI90, EASI50 and IGA(0,1) showed a significant 
increase in the probability of response at higher exposures which corresponded to the 200 mg/300 mg Q2W 
dosing regimen. The relationship did not reach significance for the EASI-75 endpoint (p-value=0.06). 
Logistic  regression  plots  on  safety  endpoints  of  developing  conjunctivitis  (narrow  term  and  broad  term) 
showed no significant relationship between dupilumab trough concentration and probability of reporting the 
adverse event. 
At week 16, dupilumab trough concentration quartiles were: Q1 = 15.3 mg/L, Q2 = 33.6 mg/L, Q3 = 53.4 
mg/L, Q4 = 112 mg/L.

E-R analysis  regarding safety 
The most commonly reported adverse drug reaction was Conjunctivitis but there was no evidence of a 
concentration relationship for the probability of developing conjunctivitis.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalytical methods 
Methods applied for the detection of functional dupilumab and for the detection of anti-dupilumab antibodies 
and neutralizing antibodies correspond to the methods already utilized and described in previous 
applications. With regard to the applied ADA assay method, the MAH confirmed that the original ADA assay 
method REGN668-AV-13089-VA-01V2 with the AD population specific cut point was used to analyze all 
phase 3 studies.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The package on clinical pharmacology regarding adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD comprises 
4 dupilumab clinical studies where PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) data have been collected. A variety of 
subcutaneous (SC) dosing regimens was evaluated in these studies including: 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg single 
dose or repeated QW dose, 200 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q2W, and 300 mg Q4W. 
Study R668-AD-1434 is an ongoing, phase 3, OLE study investigating the long-term safety, efficacy, PK, and 
immunogenicity of dupilumab in paediatric patients with AD who have previously completed a clinical study 
with dupilumab. Adolescent patients who participated in paediatric studies from dupilumab in AD 
(R668-AD-1526, R668-AD-1412, and R668-AD-1607) could roll-over into this study. This was a first-step 
analysis conducted on data from adolescent patients enrolled in this study.  
In the PK analysis, the mean trough concentration at Week 16 in adolescent patients, who were up-titrated 
to the proposed to-be-marketed 200 mg/300 mg Q2W dosing regimen for adolescents, was approximately 
45 mg/L. There was considerable variability in trough concentrations at week 16 in adolescents receiving the 
weight-tiered 200 mg/300 mg Q2W dosing regimen (CV% 41.7-51.6%). This was due to a difference in the 
duration of treatment with the 300 mg Q4W regimen before being uptitrated to 200/300 mg Q2W regimen 
in case of inadequate response, as per study protocol. The high variability would not be expected in a 
standard treatment regimen and therefore is not considered to be of clinical relevance. 
Overall, the strategy for data analysis using population PK modelling by external validation and subsequent 
parameter re-estimation of the adult pop PK model using data collected from adolescent patients is 
considered appropriate.  
The previously developed adult base model predicted dupilumab concentrations in adolescents reasonably 
well. The incorporation of allometric scaling for the impact of weight on Vc, Ke and Vm, resulted in modest 
improvements in predictions but the observed adolescent trough concentrations remained lower than those 
predicted by around 5-10 mg/L. This difference of ~16-25% was considered small and not clinically 
significant, given the observed efficacy in adolescents receiving 200/300 mg Q2W. 
However, the MAH changed the plan to apply the adult base model to the adolescent data. During an 
examination of the VPC, a somewhat poor prediction of BLQ frequency was observed in addition to a slight 
over-prediction of observed PK data in adolescents. The MAH considered more appropriate to estimate Vm 
instead of fixing it based on the adult model. This approach allowed for a better description of the BLQ 
frequency, but still did not completely address the issue. Of note, patients with high and/or moderate ADA 
titers were also excluded from the analysis (2 patients overall, patient IDs 814-011-003 and 840-011-004). 
The MAH re-discussed the influence of BLQ, weight and ADA. It was clarified that low titer ADA has been 
included in the analysis with no impact on the final VPC, whereas individuals with moderate ADA titers (N=2) 
and high ADA titer (N=0) were excluded a priori from the analysis. No other potential reasons that might 
affect dupilumab PK in the adolescent populations were taken into account. Thus, detected deviation in the 
VPC during external validation of the adult model with adolescent data remains unexplained. Nevertheless, 
the issue is regarded solved as no major revelvance. 
Following the discussion on target-mediated clearance (represented by Vm), the MAH was asked to similarly 
discuss potential differences between adult and adolescent regarding ka, F as these parameters may differ 
in other age groups compared to the adult population using modelling and simulation and sensitivity 
analyses. In response to Q6, the applicant further discussed the impact of fixing F and ka with respect to 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 45/147 
 
 
  
  
both the adult and adolescent population. To justify equal F and ka in both age groups, the MAH provided 
%change in difference in ka (12%) and apparent volume of distribution (10%) between adults and 
adolescents. Sensitivity analysis was used to justify that these changes are not clinically relevant. From the 
%change values a potential increase of 1.1-fold increase in bioavailability could be derived. It is agreed that 
this has no high impact on any conclusion regarding dosing. Hence, the issue is solved. 
To better evaluate allometric effects, the MAH was asked to provide estimated allometric exponents on CL 
and central volume of distribution based on adult and adolescent data, respectively, using a two 
compartment model that is parameterized accordingly. As requested, the MAH provided algometric 
exponents on CL and V2 using the re-parameterized population PK model. Although it is agreed that the 
impact on weight and V2 are in the same range with respect to both adults and adolescence, it is noted that 
tested covariate BMI and weight on the same parameter simultaneously are highly correlated with 
estimation of BMI on CL being not very robust as indicated by bootstrapping. This limits the interpretability 
and probably confounds the estimation of weight allometric exponent on clearance. 
Population PK parameters of adolescents were mostly similar to those in adult models, and similar to those 
published for other IgG4 monoclonal antibodies. Target-mediated clearance (Vm) was somewhat higher in 
adolescent than adult patients (base model 1.46 and 1.07 mg/L/d, respectively). It is agreed that this 
difference is likely inconsequential. In the sensitivity analysis, when additive error was fixed to a 0.01 mg/L, 
to give greater weight to rare small concentrations and BLQ values in the sparse adolescent data and hence 
estimate Vm better, the Vm estimate reduced to 1.26 mg/L/d. 
In adolescent patients, the covariates of ADA, BMI, EASI score, and weight were statistically significant and 
consistent with the adult model. The statistically significant impact of albumin on central volume and race on 
elimination rate in adults was not replicated in adolescents. This is possibly due to the considerably smaller 
sample size. The narrower range of albumin levels in adolescents than in adults (16 vs. 35 g/L, respectively) 
may have also contributed. Given that the impact of race on Ke and albumin on V2 in adults was not clinically 
important, the similarity of PK among adult and adolescent data shown in the covariate analysis is agreed. 
The covariate effect of EASI score on Ke in adolescents (0.356) is more than double the effect in adults 
(0.143). However, the overall effect of this covariate in the model was not influential or deemed to be 
clinically significant. Clarification received revealed that the covariate of weight on ke was a typographical 
error thus not affecting any result or conclusion. 
Overall, it is agreed that the base and covariate PK models adequately described the PK of dupilumab in 
adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Diagnostic plots for both base and covariate models 
showed an acceptable fit. Bootstrapping validated the parameter estimates. In the omega matrix for the 
adolescent covariate model, the bootstrap CIs for V2 and Ke do not contain the median. This is because in 
the columns with the parameters of the adolescent base model, the rows of omega matrix were mistakenly 
switched between ke and V2 of the report. Once correctly labelled, the Confidence Intervals for Omegas of 
V2 and ke do include the respective median values. This typographical error does not affect any result or 
conclusion. The inter-individual variability (CV%) of V2 and ke in the base model was 14.3% and 36.5%, 
respectively. The inter-individual variability (CV%) of V2 and ke in the covariate model was 14.2% and 
32.6%, respectively. 
The MAH was asked to analyze potential age- and weight-related covariates regarding ka and F in the 
adolescent patient population. The provided analysis is limited by the sparse amount of PK samples collected 
from the pivotal study R668-AD-1526. Thus, further analyses and assessing covariate effects on ka and F 
has not been possible. Omega (V2) estimated from the final model is wider compared to Omega (V2) 
estimated from the base model which is considered not plausible. In addition, shrinkage on V2 was high 
(54.3%) and also rises from the base to the final pop PK model. Thus, the MAH was asked to justify covariate 
selection. The MAH clarified that there was labelling error that led to the issue regarding Omega(V2). In 
addition the MAH elaborated on the justification of covariate selection on the basis of relatively high 
shrinkage and is deemed acceptable as they have been in the same range regarding both adults and 
adolescents and thus, this issue was considered resolved. 
VPC plots indicate a slight under-prediction following 300 mg Q2W treatment. Overall model diagnostics 
showed no major model deficiencies indicating that the population PK model describes the data acceptably 
well.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 46/147 
  
  
The PK parameters estimated for the adolescent patients were used to calculate the Cmax, Cmin, and AUC 
values after the first dose and at steady state for the proposed dosing regimen 200 mg and 300mg Q2W, as 
well as for 300mg Q4W.  
Estimation of the central compartment volume of distribution (V2) yielded similar values for adolescents vs. 
adults (2.54±0.0473 vs. 2.76±0.021 L, respectively). Derived values for clearance for the adolescent 
population (0.128 L/d) and adult population (0.130 L/d) are deemed comparable. 
Simulated exposure to Dupilumab by treatment regimens supports the chosen 60 kg threshold for 
differential dosing (200 mg < 60kg; 300 mg ≥ 60 kg). Simulated mean Ctrough at steady state following 200 
mg treatment is calculated to reach 61.6 mg/L which is in accordance to mean Ctrough of 62.3 mg/L 
simulated following 300 mg treatment in the target adolescent patient population. AUCss is also deemed 
comparable among the two body weight groups. 
Detectable differences in mean dupilumab exposure between adolescents and adult are not considered 
major given the overall high variability in data which is supported by population PK analysis. The mean 
dupilumab concentration reached following 200 mg Q2W treatment was more comparable than mean 
concentrations following 300 mg when opposing AD and Asthma adolescent patients. 
To support the adequacy of the proposed dosing regimen for adolescents, the applicant provided logistic 
regression plots to show the probability of attaining a target trough concentration (“cut off”) of 32.7 mg/L 
over the body weight distribution. These demonstrated that, over the weight range of interest, a much 
greater percentage of adolescent patients receiving the 200/300 mg Q2W regimen achieve the target trough 
concentration compared to adolescents receiving the 300 mg Q4W regimen. 
Bioequivalence PFP vs. PFS 
The comparison of the two presentations was discussed during procedure EMEA/H/C/004390/X/04/G 
(extension application for asthma and adults and adolescents) and raised again in this application based on 
the same bioequivalence study. In answer to concerns raised by CHMP, the same clarification provided by 
the company as for the procedure EMEA/H/C/004390/X/04/G allowed to conclude that the PFP comparability 
is considered demonstrated. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was analysed in all clinical studies which included adolescent AD patients.  
In Study R668-AD-1412, an unexpectedly high ADA response was observed and high or moderate titer 
responses were associated with a substantial reduction in detectable drug concentrations. However, it is 
agreed that this significant immune response was most probably invoked due to the unusual study design, 
where a single dose followed by an 8-week pause and then followed by repetitive dosing was applied. ADA 
rates seemed to be slightly higher in the adolescent as compared to the adult AD population.   
In study R668-AD-1526, 20.5% of patients were found to be positive for treatment-emergent ADA in the 
300 mg Q2W dosing group. In the adult AD study R668-AD-1224, this dosing regimen led to a 
treatment-emergent ADA response in only 5.71% of patients. In the extension study R668-AD-1434, the 
increased incidence of ADA and NAb was further confirmed in the adolescent as compared to the adult AD 
population. The applicant has thoroughly discussed the higher ADA rates in the adolescent AD population 
and elucidated potential reasons for this observation. It is acknowledged that the majority of 
treatment-emergent ADA response was transient during pivotal study 1526 and that neither high nor 
persistent ADA titers were detected. With regard to total treatment-emergent responses corrected 
incidences show similar results compared with the adult AD phase 3 studies. It is acknowledged that the 
small number of NAb positive patients hampers a thorough analysis as to differences of nAb incidences in the 
adult and adolescent populations and impacts on PK/efficacy. The justification of the distorted ADA results 
due to the prime and boost response in patients treated in study 1412 during the OLE study is 
comprehensible and endorsed. Thus, the immunogenicity profile of adults and adolescents treated with 
dupilumab was similar. No significant impact of treatment-emergent ADA on exposure, safety or efficacy 
was observed. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 47/147 
 
 
  
  
In  study  R668-AD-1526,  with  regard  to  dupilumab exposure  and  efficacy,  the  applicant  states that  ADA 
status has no clinically relevant impact on these parameters. However, having a closer look into the data, 
dupilumab exposure in the 300mg Q2W was clearly reduced in ADA positive patients, although there seemed 
to be no impact on EASI % change from baseline (Figure 46). This appears to be different for NRS % change 
from baseline. Similar to the observed trend towards reduced dupilumab exposure in ADA positive patients, 
a lower NRS % change from baseline was observed for ADA positive patients in both the 200 mg and the 300 
mg Q2W dosing groups (Figure 48 and 49). The applicant was requested to discuss the impact of ADA status 
on exposure and efficacy in the adolescent AD population. In addition, in one of the two patients showing 
considerably  lower  dupilumab  concentrations  while  exhibiting  low  ADA  titers,  dupilumab  concentrations 
were low from week 4 to week 16 but then increased (Figure 31). Although the applicant was unable to 
determine a specific reason for the increased concentration, the issue is not further pursued. Despite low 
drug exposure, this ADA positive patient achieved a high response as measured by EASI. It appears that 
variability in drug exposure may not explain all the between-subject variability in response to drug. 
In study R668-Ad-1434, the distribution of dupilumab concentrations for ADA-positive patients was 
generally in the range of concentrations of ADA-negative patients with the exception of a few patients with 
moderate or high ADA titers. In these patients, as the ADA titres reached moderate or high levels, dupilumab 
concentration decreased to the LLOQ. A longitudinal assessment of the ADA titer and dupilumab 
concentration over time, in 4 patients with moderate/high titers, showed that ADA titers eventually fall with 
continued dosing, and this decline was associated with a corresponding increase in dupilumab 
concentrations. The biological reason for the decline in ADA titer over time with continued dupilumab 
treatment is unclear, but may be a result of tolerance. These 4 patients were off treatment before enrolment 
into the OLE study. 
In order to clarify the duration of ADA positive status following withdrawal of dupixent, the applicant 
provided data showing the ADA titer of each patient at the end of treatment visit of the parent studies 
R668-AD-1526 and R668-AD-1412 and at the baseline of the open label extension study R668-AD-1434. 
The duration between these time points ranged from 1 week to 4 months. 
Exposure-Response 
The indication in adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD is based primarily on the phase 3 randomized 
controlled study R668-AD-1526 assessing efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adolescent patients. 
Exposure-response (E-R) data and analyses are presented to support the dosing regimen in adolescent 
patients. The primary study endpoint, the percentage of patients achieving an IGA score of 0 or 1, as well as 
the secondary endpoint, mean (standard deviation [SD]) percent EASI change from baseline, over time by 
quartile of functional dupilumab concentration has been assessed including various imputation methods to 
account for the effect of censored data due to dropout, as well as a completer analysis. The MAH was asked 
to discuss why more than 20% of samples have not been quantifiable in Study R688-AD-1526 following 
dupilumab dosing taking BLQ samples into account. 17% (1/6) of the samples were collected outside the 
treatment period of study R668-AD-1526 and are therefore not quantifiable. The issue is regarded to be 
solved. 
The time course of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was analyzed as a biomarker of AD disease severity over 
time. The pharmacodynamics of LDH shows similar effects of dupilumab between adolescent and adult AD 
patients. 
Exposure-response relationships via quartile analysis indicate increasing drug effects with increasing serum 
trough concentration with respect to efficacy. Specifically, the percent of adolescent patients achieving the 
primary endpoint (IGA score of 0 or 1) increased with increasing quartile of functional dupilumab 
concentration. A similar trend was observed for EASI, where increasing percent change from baseline EASI 
scores was associated with increasing quartiles of dupilumab concentrations, plateauing from Ctrough_ss of 
20 – 40 mg/L.  
Logistic regression plots on binary efficacy endpoints EASI90, EASI50 and IGA (0,1) showed a significant 
increase in the probability of response at higher exposures which corresponded to the 200 mg/300 mg Q2W 
dosing regimen. The relationship did not reach significance for the EASI-75 endpoint (p-value=0.06).

EMA/463030/2019

Logistic regression plots on safety endpoints of developing conjunctivitis (narrow term and broad term) 
showed no significant relationship between dupilumab trough concentration and probability of reporting the 
adverse event. 
At week 16, dupilumab trough concentration quartiles were: Q1 = 15.3 mg/L, Q2 = 33.6 mg/L, Q3 = 53.4 
mg/L, Q4 = 112 mg/L. At week 16, dupilumab trough concentration quartiles were: Q1 = 15.3 mg/L, Q2 = 
33.6 mg/L, Q3 = 53.4 mg/L, Q4 = 112 mg/L. The 5th percentile of the Ctrough,ss at Week 16 achieved by 
the standard 300 mg Q2W regimen associated with efficacy in the adult Phase 3 trials is 32.7 mg/L; in the 
adolescent study R668-AD-1526, Ctrough,ss for the 200/300 mg Q2W regimen is 25.2 mg/L. These values 
are close or equivalent to the second quartile concentration (33.6 mg/L) at Week 16. In contrast, the 5th 
percentile for Ctrough,ss at Week 16 achieved by the 300 mg Q4W regimen in adolescents with AD was <0.1 
mg/L; the marked reduction compared to the 200/300 mg Q2W regimen is a reflection of the non-linear PK 
profile of dupilumab. 
No evidence of a concentration relationship for the probability of developing conjunctivitis could be detected 
from exposure quartile analyses with respect to safety. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  MAH  provided  a  comprehensive  package  on  clinical  pharmacology  to  support  the  dosing  regimen  in 
adolescent patients with AD, tiered by body weight with patients <60 kg receiving 200 mg Q2W following a 
400 mg loading dose, and patients ≥ 60 kg receiving 300mg Q2W following a 600 mg loading dose.  
The PK and PD of dupilumab in adolescent patients with AD were studied and characterised to support this 
application.  Overall,  the  data  suggest  that  adolescents  and  adults  with  moderate-to-severe  AD  display 
similar PK when compared at various dosing regimens across phase 2 and phase 3 studies. The similarity in 
PK between adolescent and adult patients with AD is further supported by the population PK analysis. 
No evidence of a concentration relationship for the probability of developing conjunctivitis could be detected 
from exposure quartile analyses. 
ADA rates seemed to be slightly higher in the adolescent as compared to the adult AD population. The 
applicant has thoroughly discussed the higher ADA rates in the adolescent AD population and elucidated 
potential reasons for this observation. It is acknowledged that the majority of treatment-emergent ADA 
response was transient during pivotal study 1526 and that neither high nor persistent ADA titers were 
detected. With regard to total treatment-emergent responses corrected incidences show similar results 
compared with the adult AD phase 3 studies. It is acknowledged that the small number of NAb positive 
patients hampers a thorough analysis as to differences of NAb incidences in the adult and adolescent 
populations and impacts on PK/efficacy. The justification of the distorted ADA results due to the prime and 
boost response in patients treated in study 1412 during the OLE study is comprehensible and endorsed. 
Thus, the immunogenicity profile of adults and adolescents treated with dupilumab was similar. No 
significant impact of treatment-emergent ADA on exposure, safety or efficacy was observed. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program of dupilumab in the treatment of adolescent AD comprises 4 clinical 
studies. R668-AD-1526 is the pivotal phase 3 monotherapy study in patients aged 12-18 years with 
moderate-to-severe AD not adequately controlled with currently available topical treatments. Supportive 
data are derived from a phase 2a, open-label pharmacokinetic (PK)/safety study  (R668-AD-1412), an 
pediatric open-label extension study (R668-AD-1434) and an open-label autoinjector (AI) study 
(R668-AD-1607, note: data assessed as part of the extension of indication in asthma).  
Patients from the above 3 studies had the option to screen for an OLE study (R668-AD-1434). This phase 3, 
multicenter, OLE study is enrolling patients from different studies in different age groups, covering the entire 
spectrum of the pediatric age groups from 6 months to <18 years of age (Section 2.4). For this subsequent 
marketing application, only data from adolescent patients (≥12 to <18 years of age) are included from study

R668-AD-1434. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate long-term safety of dupilumab in 
pediatric patients. Additionally, this study provided long-term efficacy data. A total of 275 adolescent 
patients were included in the study (as of the data cut-off date of 21 Apr 2018). For the OLE study, 
R668-AD-1434, a first-step CSR was written to support this submission using the data cut-off date of 21 Apr 
2018, and a final CSR will be completed at a later date. Additional data from a later data cut-off of December 
2018 were provided as part of the response to the request for Supplementary information with 
approximately  300 patients at baseline. 
The number of patients (275) listed included all adolescent patients from the 3 prior studies as of data cutoff 
for this submission (21 April 2018), including 33 of the 40 patients in the adolescent group from 
R668-AD-1412, 3 younger patients from R668-AD-1412 who reached 12 years of age at the time rolling over 
to R668-AD-1434, 201 of 250 patients from R668-AD-1526, 11 of 18 adolescent patients from Part A of 
R668-AD-1607, and 27 adolescent patients from Part B of R668-AD-1607 (the primary objective of Part B 
was to collect actual use data on use of 300 mg PFP and 300 mg PFS; this part of the study was not complete 
as of data cutoff for this application).  Two of the previous studies (R668-AD-1412 and R668-AD-1607) were 
open label.  The third study (R668-AD-1526) had been un-blinded, primary analysis completed and results 
are included as part of this application. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The efficacy of dupilumab in adolescent patients with AD was first explored in a phase 2a study 
(R668-AD-1412). Adolescent patients (≥12 to <18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe AD were included 
in this study. The primary objective of the study was to characterize the safety and PK of dupilumab in 
patients with AD; efficacy was evaluated as a secondary objective. This was an open-label, uncontrolled 
study with 2 sequential, ascending-dose cohorts (dose cohort 1 [2 mg/kg] and dose cohort 2 [4 mg/kg]). 
This study consisted of Part A (single-dose treatment and an 8-week semi-dense PK sampling period), and 
Part B (including a 4-week repeat-dose treatment period [4 weekly doses] and an 8-week follow-up period). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 50/147 
 
 
 
  
  
A total of 40 adolescent patients were enrolled into the study and randomized to the 2 treatment groups (20 
patients in the 2 mg/kg group and 20 patients in the 4 mg/kg group).  
Methods 
Study Design 
Study R668-AD-1412 was a phase 2a, multicenter, open-label, ascending-dose, sequential-cohort study 
investigating the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a single dose (2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg) 
of dupilumab administered SC followed by repeat-doses of the same doses weekly for 4 weeks in pediatric 
patients with moderate-to-severe AD (for adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age) or severe AD (for pediatric 
patients ≥6 to <12 years of age) that was not adequately controlled with topical treatments. Approximately 
80 patients were planned to be enrolled in this study.  
The study consisted of a screening period (day -35 to day -1), a baseline visit, Part A (including a 
single-dose treatment and an 8-week semi-dense PK sampling period), and Part B (including a 
4-week repeat-dose treatment period [4 weekly doses] and an 8-week follow-up period to assess 
safety, PK and return of clinical signs of AD). Patients who completed this study were offered an 
opportunity to enroll in an OLE study (patients <18 years old at end of study were offered 
screening for the pediatric OLE, patients ≥18 years old were offered screening for the adult OLE). 
Study participants 
Two sequential, ascending-dose cohorts were planned, as follows: dose cohort 1 (2 mg/kg) and dose cohort 
2 (4 mg/kg). Within each dose cohort, approximately 36 to 40 patients were to be enrolled in 2 age subsets, 
as follows: subset A (adolescent ≥12 to <18 years of age; presented in this SCE) and subset B (children ≥6 
to <12 years of age; not presented in this SCE). Enrollment and study dosing started with cohort 1A (2 
mg/kg, adolescent age subset) and proceeded in sequence to cohort 1B (2 mg/kg, children age subset), 
cohort 2A (4 mg/kg, adolescent age subset), and cohort 2B (4 mg/kg, children age subset); a safety review 
of data from the previous cohort(s) was performed before proceeding to the next cohort. 
Objective/outcomes 
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety and PK of SC treatment with dupilumab in 
pediatric patients with AD. The secondary objective included an assessment of the immunogenicity and 
efficacy of dupilumab in this patient population.  
Concomitant treatments/rescue medication 
The use of topical medication for AD (including TCS and TCIs) was permitted during the study. 
It was recommended that investigators should select the potency based on the age of the patient, severity 
of disease and affected region, and that use be consistent with local guidelines.  
The use of TCIs was reserved for areas of the body that were more prone to side effects from TCS use (eg, 
face, intertriginous, and genital areas). If medically necessary (ie, to control intolerable AD symptoms), 
rescue treatment for AD was provided to study patients at the discretion of the investigator. This included 
topical therapies (eg, high-potency TCS) or systemic medications like corticosteroids and non-steroidal 
immunosuppressive drugs (eg, ciclosporin, MTX, mycophenolate-mofetil, or azathioprine). Efficacy 
assessments were EASI, IGA of AD severity, pruritus NRS, SCORAD, BSA involvement with AD, and at some 
study sites AD area photographs.  
Results 
Patient Disposition 
A total of 40 adolescent patients were enrolled into the study (20 patients in the 2 mg/kg group and 20 
patients in the 4 mg/kg group). 
Most (38/40 [95.0%] patients) completed treatment; 2 patients withdrew (1 due to an adverse event [AE] 
of animal bite for which rabies vaccine was given, and another patient for fear of study drug injections). 
Thirty-five (87.5%) patients continued in the pediatric OLE study and 4 (10.0%) patients went on to

participate in the adult OLE study (patients who had turned 18 years old during the study were offered 
participation in the adult OLE). 
Demographics, and Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Overall, baseline demographic characteristics were comparable between the 2 dose groups (2 mg/kg and 4 
mg/kg). The majority of patients were white (80%) and female (55%); the mean (SD) age of adolescent 
patients enrolled was 14.5 (1.8) years, the mean (SD) weight was 54.7 (12.2) kg with a weight range from 
32 to 81.8 kg, and the mean (SD) BMI was 21.0 (3.7) kg/m2. 
Overall, baseline disease characteristics were comparable between the 2 dose groups and consistent overall 
with moderate-to-severe disease; however, since patients were not randomized into the dose cohorts, some 
minor differences were observed. The majority of patients had disease onset prior to 5 years of age (85%); 
the mean (SD) duration of AD was 12.2 (3.4) years; the mean (SD) EASI score was 31.7 (16.0); 47.5% of 
patients had IGA=3 (moderate disease) and 52.5% had IGA=4 (severe disease); the mean (SD) pruritus 
NRS score was 6.5 (2.3); and the mean (SD) BSA involvement was 49.0% (24.9). 
Efficacy Results 
Efficacy analyses were performed using the safety analysis set (SAF), which included all patients who 
received any study drug. 
Dupilumab administered as a single dose of either 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg induced significant and rapid 
reduction of disease activity in patients at week 2 (34% and 51% reduction in EASI score from baseline for 
2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg doses, respectively). Starting at week 8, patients received repeated weekly doses of 
dupilumab for 4 weeks, which led to a further improvement in disease severity in patients in both dose 
groups (67% and 70% reduction in EASI score from baseline for 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg doses, respectively 
at week 12). 
There did not appear to be a clear dose response as the 2 dose cohorts showed similar efficacy on the various 
endpoints evaluated during the study. Efficacy results from this study are summarized in Table 7.

within 4 weeks before the baseline visit [eyelid infection]) and visit performed out of window (2 patients in 
the 4 mg/kg dose cohort). 
This was an exploratory efficacy study so it is acceptable as an open-label design and was not powered for 
comparison of treatment arms with each other however is sufficient for the intended objectives.  
Of the 40 included patients of study 1412, the majority (95%) completed the treatment and most patients 
(97.5%) transitioned into the OLE study, thereof 10 % into the adult OLE study.    
Both doses induced a reduction in disease activity regarding the reduction in EASI score from baseline at 
week 2 (34% and 51%); there did not appear to be a clear dose response as the 2 dose cohorts showed 
similar efficacy on the various endpoints evaluated during the study, however, effects on IGA reduction were 
less pronounced and more apparent in the 4 mg/kg group than in the 2 mg/kg dose group. The treatment 
effect on IGA after 12-20 weeks is comparable to that of the 200/300mg Q4W dose group. 
A statistically significant improvement in EASI is demonstrated form week 10 with a maximal effect at week 
12 for both cohorts. At week 12 which represents the end of active treatment the effects diminish to week 20 
but are still statistically significant. Similar to EASI the effects are statistically significantly higher at week 10 
for both groupsHowever, % change from baseline is considered clinically relevant and diminishes at week 20 
following withdrawal of treatment. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study title : R668-AD-1526 – Phase 3, 16-Week Treatment, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled 
Monotherapy Study 
Methods 
R668-AD-1526 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study to investigate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab monotherapy in adolescent patients (≥12 to <18 
years of age), with moderate- to-severe AD whose disease could not be adequately controlled with topical 
medications or for whom topical treatment was medically inadvisable (eg., intolerance, other important side 
effects, or safety risks). 
The study consisted of the following 3 periods: screening of up to 5 weeks, a treatment period of 16 weeks, 
and a follow-up period of 12 weeks. Patients were offered the opportunity to screen for the pediatric OLE 
study at the end of treatment. Patients who declined to participate in the OLE study were followed for 12 
weeks after completion of treatment.

Study participants 
Key Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria for R668-AD-1526 were designed to ensure that only patients with 
moderate-to-severe AD, whose disease was not adequately controlled with topical treatment, were included. 
In addition, patients with other concomitant diseases or conditions that may have confounded efficacy and 
safety assessments were excluded from the studies. 
The inclusion criteria for the adolescent population specified male and female patients, ≥12 to <18 years of 
age with chronic AD (present for at least 1 year and meeting the American Academy of Dermatology 
Consensus Criteria (Eichenfield, 2014). 
Required baseline AD severity scores were IGA score ≥3, EASI score ≥16, ≥10% BSA involvement with AD, 
and pruritus NRS average score for maximum itch intensity of ≥4. 
Patients were also required either to have a documented recent history (within 6 months before the 
screening visit) of an inadequate response to treatment with topical medications or deemed not to be 
appropriate candidates for such topical therapies (eg, because of important potential side effects from TCS).  
An inadequate response was defined as failure to achieve and maintain remission or a low disease activity 
state (comparable to IGA 0=clear to 2=mild) despite treatment with a daily regimen of TCS of medium to 
higher potency (± TCI as appropriate), applied for at least 28 days or for the maximum duration 
recommended by the product prescribing information (eg, 14 days for super-potent TCS), whichever was 
shorter.  
Patients with documented systemic treatment for AD (systemic immunosuppressant drugs such as 
ciclosporin, MTX, corticosteroids, etc) in the past 6 months were also considered inadequate responders to 
topical treatments and were potentially eligible for treatment with dupilumab after an appropriate washout 
period. All patients were required to apply a stable dose of topical emollient (moisturizer) twice daily for at 
least 7 consecutive days before the baseline visit and throughout the study. 
Exclusion criteria designed to prevent confounding of efficacy results included prior participation in a 
dupilumab clinical study, treatment with any other systemic investigational product, recent treatment with 
systemic biologic therapy or immunosuppressive agent, planned use of any prohibited medications or 
procedures during the treatment period, and presence of any skin comorbidities that could interfere with 
study assessments. Exclusion criteria to protect patient safety included a baseline body weight <30 kg, 
known or suspected immunodeficiency, active infections including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and endoparasitic 
infections, and treatment with a live vaccine within 4 weeks of the baseline visit. 
Treatments 
Approximately 240 study patients were planned to be randomized to 1 of the following treatment groups: 
• Dupilumab Q2W treatment group: 200 mg Q2W for patients <60 kg or 300 mg Q2W for patients ≥60 kg 
following an initial dose of 400 mg or 600 mg, respectively 
• Dupilumab Q4W treatment group: 300 mg Q4W, irrespective of weight following an initial dose of 600 mg 
• Placebo group 
Concomitant treatment/rescue medication 
The rescue therapies included topical therapies (eg, medium-/high-potency TCS) as well as oral/systemic 
medications like corticosteroids and non-steroidal immunosuppressive drugs (eg, ciclosporin, methotrexate 
[MTX], mycophenolate-mofetil, or azathioprine) for patients who did not respond adequately after at least 7 
days of topical treatment. 
Topical calcineurin inhibitors were permitted for use for rescue, alone or in combination with TCS, but the 
use of TCIs was reserved for problem areas only (eg, face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, etc). 
Investigators may also have considered rescue with crisaborole (ie, after the point in the study where 
crisaborole was approved, and the protocol was amended to reflect this option as a rescue medication).

• Titer Values (Titer value category) 
− Low (titer <1,000) 
− Moderate (1,000≤ titer ≤10,000) 
− High (titer >10,000) 
Samples positive in the ADA assay were further characterized for ADA titers and for the presence of 
neutralizing antibody (NAb) response. 
• Total patients positive in the NAb assay  
Treatment-emergent or treatment boosted ADA positive patients that were positive in the NAb assay at any 
time point analyzed. 
Serum samples for measurements of biomarkers to study the pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of dupilumab 
in pediatric AD patients were collected at time points.  
Sample size 
The final analysis was planned for 240 patients who were enrolled into 3 study groups: dupilumab Q2W 
(200mg Q2W or 300 mg Q2W), dupilumab Q4W (300mg Q4W), or placebo group in North America. 
With 80 patients per group, at the 2-sided 5% significance level, the study has: 
•  98% power to detect a difference of 28% between dupilumab Q2W treatment and placebo treatment 
in the percentage of patients who achieve an IGA score 0 to 1 at week 16, assuming that the 
percentages are 37% and 9% for dupilumab Q2W and placebo, respectively. 
•  88% power to detect a difference of 20% between dupilumab Q4W treatment and placebo treatment 
in the percentage of patients who achieve an IGA score 0 to 1 at week 16, assuming  that the 
percentages are 29% and 9% for dupilumab Q4W and placebo, respectively.

•  99% power to detect a difference of 35% between dupilumab Q2W treatment and placebo treatment 
in the percentages of patients achieving EASI-75 response at week 16, assuming that the 
percentages are 48% and 13% for dupilumab Q2W and placebo, respectively. 
•  99% power to detect a difference of 32% between dupilumab Q4W treatment and placebo treatment 
in percentages of patients achieving EASI-75 response at week 16, assuming that the percentages 
are 45% and 13% for dupilumab Q4W and placebo, respectively.  
•  Additional power calculation based on the key secondary endpoint “proportion of patients with 
improvement (reduction) of Pruritus NRS ≥4 from baseline to week 16”, with 80 patients per 
group, the study will provide: 
•  97% power at a 0.05 level to detect a difference of 27% in the percentages of patients achieving 
Pruritus NRS reduction ≥4 at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 38% and 11% for 
dupilumab Q2W and placebo, respectively. 
•  95% power at a 0.05 level to detect a difference of 25% in the percentages of patients achieving 
weekly average of daily peak Pruritus NRS reduction ≥4 at week 16, assuming that the percentages 
are 36% and 11% for dupilumab Q4W and placebo, respectively. 
The assumptions used for the power calculations were estimated based on results from the R668-AD-1334 
and R668-AD-1416 studies (phase 3 studies for adult AD patients), and the R668-AD-1021 study (a phase 
2b dose-ranging study in adults with AD).  
Based on the result from the R668-AD-1021 study, the efficacy profile of dupilumab 200 mg Q2W is similar 
to dupilumab 300 mg Q2W. In the absence of data of dupilumab in pediatric patients with AD, the data 
observed in the adult studies R668-AD-1334, R668-AD-1416, and R668-AD-1021 are used for these sample 
size calculations. This is a conservative assumption as it is expected that the effect of dupilumab in children 
will be greater than that seen in adults. Children have disease for a shorter duration than adults and the 
disease is more Th2 driven in acute phase while it becomes more type 1 helper T cell in chronic phase 
(Thepen 1996, Gittler 2012). In addition, children with AD in general respond better to systemic therapies 
than adults (Schmitt 2007). A recent study compared the differences between activated and polarized T-cell 
subsets in blood of adult and pediatric patients with AD. The study found that AD is Th2 dominated in 
children while it extends to additional helper T cell subsets, particularly Th22, in adults (Czarnowicki 2015). 
Randomisation 
Randomization (1:1:1) was stratified by baseline weight group (<60 kg and ≥60 kg) and baseline disease 
severity (moderate [IGA=3] vs severe [IGA=4] AD). 
Blinding (masking) 
With the exception of the IDMC members, this study remained blinded to all individuals until the 
pre-specified unblinding to conduct the primary analyses. 
To maintain the blind, all patients received Q2W injections of dupilumab or placebo starting at day 1. During 
weeks in which dupilumab was not administered in the Q4W dosing regimen, patients received placebo. 
Anti-drug antibody and drug concentration results were not communicated to the sites, and the sponsor’s 
operational team did not have access to results associated with patient identification until after the final 
database lock. 
Statistical methods 
The full analysis set was planned to be used for the efficacy analysis, where all randomized patients were 
considered as they were allocated at randomization. For the efficacy analysis each study group of dupilumab 
treatment was planned to be compared with the placebo group by all efficacy variables. A supportive 
analysis of the primary endpoint was performed using the per protocol set (PPS). 
For all binary primary and key-secondary endpoints the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted by 
randomization strata (baseline disease severity and weight group) was used for each comparison. The 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 58/147 
 
 
  
  
patients were planned to be classified as a non-responder if rescue medication was used before week 16 or 
if the patient withdraw from study. 
Continuous key-secondary endpoints were planned to be analysed by ANCOVA, where treatment and 
randomisation strata (baseline disease severity and weight group) were included in the model. Missing 
values were planned to be imputed 40 times by multiple imputation. Patients receiving rescue treatment will 
be treated as missing and in this case data will not be imputed. 
For multiplicity adjustment, a hierarchical procedure was used to control the overall Type-1 error rate at 
0.05 for the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints across the 2 dupilumab dose regimens versus 
placebo. Each hypothesis will be formally tested only if the preceding one is significant at the 2-sided 0.05 
significance level. The order of hypothesis tests for the primary and key secondary endpoints is presented in 
the following Table: 
Sensitivity analysis: 
In case of Mantel-Fleiss (MF) criterion did not met, sensitivity analyses including each factor separately in 
CMH test was conducted. Sensitivity analysis using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach to 
determine patient’s status at week 16 was conducted to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy 
analysis with regards to handling of missing data. The efficacy data was set to missing after rescue 
treatment was used, and the LOCF method was used to determine patients’ status at week 16. In addition, 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method adjusted by randomization strata was also performed on all observed 
data regardless if rescue treatment was used. A patient with missing data was counted as a non-responder. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Overall patient disposition in R668-AD-1526 is shown in Table 11. A total of 295 patients were screened for 
study eligibility , 251 of whom were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio . The most common causes for 
patients failing screening were lack of adequate disease severity and lack of willingness to comply with study 
visits and procedures.

One of the randomized patients was not treated; this patient did not meet one of the study eligibility criteria 
and was withdrawn due to protocol violation. A high proportion of the patients completed the study 
treatment (92.0%). The proportion of patients who withdrew from study treatment was higher in the 
placebo group (10.6%) than in the combined dupilumab treatment group (6.6%). A lack of study drug 
efficacy was the most common reason recorded for withdrawal from the study treatment for patients in the 
placebo group; no patients in the combined dupilumab treatment group withdrew from the study treatment 
due to lack of study drug efficacy. 
At the time of the data cut-off (05 Apr 2018), the majority of randomized patients (80.1%), with  
approximately equal number of patients from each of the 3 treatment groups, transitioned into the 
R668-AD-1434 OLE study. A small number of patients discontinued from the study (6.0%). Withdrawal of 
consent was the most frequently cited reason for premature discontinuation from study.

The participant flow shows that nearly all randomized patients of the individual dose groups received their 
study treatment. 6.6% (11/166) of the patients treated with dupilumab did not complete the study 
treatment, thereof showed 1 patient lack of efficacy in the 300 mg Q4W group, the remaining 6 patients with 
lack of efficacy were assigned to the placebo group. 80% of the patients of this pivotal study transitioned into 
the OLE study R668-AD-1434. All other aspects such as discontinuation rate, patient withdrawals etc. were 
balanced between the treatment groups.

Amendments  
For studies with multiple protocol amendments, only the study conduct reflected in the latest protocol 
amendment prior to the database lock date is presented in this section. All amendments to the study design 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 61/147 
 
 
  
  
are documented in the individual CSRs. There were 3 amendments, amendment 1 being the most 
substantial, to the study protocol of study R-668-AD-1526 following discussion with PDCO and in accordance 
with the agreed PIP. 
Key aspects of the amendment 1 are presented below: 
•  Addition of a 200 mg Q2W regimen (with a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1) to the Q2W treatment 
group. Patients below 60 kg will receive 200 mg Q2W, while patients ≥60 kg will receive 300 mg 
Q2W (with a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1).  
Increase sample size from 180 patients to 240 patients. 
• 
•  Change duration of treatment period from 12 weeks to 16 weeks. The treatment duration was 
increased to enable detection of maximum therapeutic effect of dupilumab and maximize the 
likelihood to detect a statistically significant difference versus placebo on the primary endpoint. 
•  Revised AESI according to study results and dupilumab safety profile observed in the adult AD 
population. 
Changes to the Planned Analyses 
Throughout the conduct of the study, any type of conjunctivitis or blepharitis (severe or serious or lasting ≥4 
weeks) was considered an AESI required to be reported within 24 hours of identification. However, for the 
statistical analysis, the time frame, “lasting ≥4 weeks,” was removed from the final definition for this AESI 
criterion for conjunctivitis or blepharitis, as described in the SAP and according to the recent revision of the 
list of AESIs across the dupilumab program in AD. The rationale for this change was based on the information 
received during the course of the study for the conjunctivitis/blepharitis events lasting longer than 28 days. 
These events were not found to be clinically meaningful, as none of these events led to treatment 
discontinuation, or had been classified as severe or serious.  
Protocol deviations 
Overall, 7.1% of patients in the placebo group, 19% of patients in the dupilumab Q4W group, and 9.8% of 
patients in the Q2W group had at least 1 major protocol deviation The most common type of major protocol 
deviation  was  inadequate  informed  consent  administration  (3.2%  overall).  The  incidence  of  each  of  the 
other major protocol deviation categories was low (≤2% overall across the treatment groups).

Baseline data 
Patient Disposition, Demographics, and Baseline Disease Characteristics 
As of the data cut-off date of 05 Apr 2018, a total of 251 patients were enrolled into the study and 
randomized (85 patients in the placebo group, 82 patients in the dupilumab Q2W group, and 84 patients in 
the Q4W group). 
A total of 231 patients completed treatment, and 20 patients discontinued treatment for the following 
primary reasons: lack of efficacy (6 patients in the placebo group) and other reasons (7 patients in 
dupilumab treatment groups and 2 patients in the placebo group). A total of 201 patients (80.1%) rolled 
over into the pediatric OLE study, R668-AD-1434.  
Overall, demographics and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the 3 treatment Groups. 
The majority of patients were white (62.5%). Male and female patients represented 59.0% and 41.0% of the 
population, respectively.  
Most patients had disease onset prior to 5 years of age (84.9%), and the mean (SD) duration of AD was 12.2 
(3.20) years. The mean (SD) EASI score was 35.5 (14.16). 
The proportion of patients with IGA scores of 3 (moderate disease) and 4 (severe disease) were 
46.2% and 53.8%, respectively. The mean (SD) pruritus NRS score was 7.6 (1.66) and the mean 
(SD) BSA involvement was 56.5% (22.97). 
A detailed description of patient disposition, demographics and baseline disease characteristics for patients 
in this study is presented below. 
Demographics 
Patient demographic characteristics were balanced among the treatment groups (Table 12). More than half 
of patients were white (62.5%) but a substantial number of patients of other races and ethnicities were also 
included in the patient population. Likewise, more than half of patients were male (59.0%) but female 
patients were adequately represented in the patient population. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 14.5 
(1.7) years. The number of patients in the 2 age subgroups (≥12 to <15 years and ≥15 to 18 years) was 
balanced across the 3 treatment groups. More than 40% of the patients were classified as overweight (BMI 
≥85 percentile for age and gender). This observation is consistent with reports in the literature describing 
that a higher proportion of adolescent patients with AD are overweight compared with the normal population 
(Silverberg, 2014).The proportion of overweight patients was balanced across the 3 treatment groups. Of 
the 2 countries from which patients enrolled (Canada and the US), most patients were in the US.

Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Overall, the treatment groups were balanced between placebo and treatment groups for the extent of 
disease (as measured by BSA), intensity of signs (as measured by EASI and IGA), severity of symptoms (as 
measured by pruritus NRS), and the duration of AD (Table 13). Most patients were diagnosed with AD before 
5 years of age. This is consistent with the age of onset of AD in adolescents as reported in the literature (Kay, 
1994). 
The baseline disease characteristics as measured by AD assessments were consistent with 
moderate-to-severe AD. A significant proportion of patients had disease onset prior to 5 years of age 
(84.9%). The mean (SD) duration of AD was 12.2 (3.20) years. The mean (SD) EASI score was 35.5 
(14.16). Approximately 46.2% of patients had IGA=3 (moderate disease) and 53.8% had IGA=4 (severe 
disease). The mean (SD) peak pruritus NRS score was 7.6 (1.66). The mean (SD) BSA involvement was 56.5 
(22.97). 
At baseline, the high CDLQI and HADS scores indicated an impaired QOL and low mental health of the 
enrolled AD patients, respectively (Table 11).

History of Atopic/Allergic Disease 
A high proportion of patients enrolled in the study also had one or more comorbid atopic/allergic condition 
(92%) (Table 14). The most commonly reported atopic co-morbidities were asthma, allergic rhinitis, and 
food allergy. These conditions are typical of the general AD population, reflecting the common underlying 
type 2 helper T cell-mediated pathophysiology of these diseases. 
The next most common atopic/allergic condition other than AD was other allergies (69.2%), which 
encompassed allergy to house dust mite, animals, plants, molds, medications, etc. (Table 14). 
Overall, the treatment groups were balanced in terms of proportion of patients with at least one or more 
comorbid allergic condition. Of note, 22.8% of all patients indicated a current history of allergic conjunctivitis 
(a higher percentage of patients in the combined dupilumab treatment group [24.8%] indicated a current 
history of allergic conjunctivitis compared to patients in the placebo group [18.8%]). 
Based on the specific atopic disease questionnaire, the proportion of patients with a family history of 
atopic/allergic conditions was similar between treatment groups (Table 12). The most common 
atopic/allergic condition in patient family history was AD. 
All patients randomized met the eligibility criteria for AD duration and severity.

History of Systemic Treatments Used for Atopic Dermatitis 
Overall, 27.6% of patients reported prior systemic corticosteroid use and 20.8% of patients indicated prior 
systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants use (Table 15). 
A slightly higher proportion of patients in the dupilumab Q4W group received prior systemic corticosteroids 
compared to patients in the placebo group and the dupilumab Q2W group. A similar proportion of patients in

all treatment groups indicated prior systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants. The most commonly used 
non-steroidal immunosuppressants were ciclosporin and methotrexate (12.8% and 10.4%, overall, 
respectively). The high proportion of adolescents who had received systemic immunosuppressant therapy is 
indicative of the severity of disease in this population. 
A high proportion of patients had a history of prior ciclosporin treatment. More than half (66.7%) of these 
patients used ciclosporin for longer than 12 weeks during their most recent course of treatment. The most 
common reason for discontinuing the most recent use of ciclosporin for all treatment groups was inadequate 
efficacy (54.4%).

Previous Medications and Procedures 
All patients in the SAF received at least 1 prior medication.  The most commonly (≥50% in any treatment 
group) used prior medications (by therapeutic class) were dermatological preparations of corticosteroids, 
antihistamines for systemic use, drugs for obstructive airway disease, and emollients and protectives. 
Overall, 27.6% of patients reported prior systemic corticosteroid use and 20.8% of patients indicated prior 
systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants use.   
A  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  dupilumab  Q4W  group  received  prior  systemic  corticosteroids 
compared to patients in the placebo group and the dupilumab Q2W group. A similar proportion of patients in 
all treatment groups indicated prior systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants. The most commonly used 
systemic  non-steroidal  immunosuppressants  were  ciclosporin  and  methotrexate  (12.8%  and  10.4%, 
overall, respectively). 
Rescue Medications 
Approximately 37.5% of the patients received rescue mediation during the 16-week treatment period (Table 
14). A higher proportion of patients in the placebo group received at least 1 rescue medication during the 
16-week treatment period, followed by patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q4W group and then by patients 
in the dupilumab Q2W group. 
The most commonly (>50% of patients in the placebo group) used dermatological rescue medication by 
therapeutic class was dermatological preparations of corticosteroids (Table 16). 
The majority of patients who used systemic corticosteroids, and all patients who used systemic non-steroidal 
immunosuppressants, were in the placebo group (Table 14). Other rescue medications used are listed in 
Table 14.

By week 16, a higher proportion of patients in the placebo group than the dupilumab treatment 
groups received systemic or topical rescue medications and among the dupilumab treated groups 
the Q4W group had a higher rate of rescue medication use than the Q2W group. The median time to 
first rescue treatment use (topical or systemic) was approximately 9 weeks for the placebo group. 
Less than 50% of patients in either of the dupilumab dose groups required rescue treatment. 
Kaplan-Meier curves of time to first rescue treatment (topical or systemic) are shown in Figure 3.

During the 16-week treatment period, the mean proportion of rescue medication-free days was lower in the 
placebo group, followed by the dupilumab Q4W and dupilumab Q2W groups. No patients in any of the 
treatment groups underwent any rescue procedures during the 16-week treatment period. 
Treatment Compliance 
The mean injection compliance was high overall (>97.5% in each treatment group) and was similar across 
the 3 treatment groups . 
Patients were required to apply stable doses of a moisturizer (emollient) twice daily for at least 
7 days before the baseline visit and at least 7 days after the baseline visit (day -7 to day 8). 
The mean (SD) background treatment compliance was similar across the 3 treatment groups with a mean 
(SD) compliance of >89% in each treatment group. 
Numbers analysed 
Sample Size and Efficacy Analysis Sets 
The primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints was performed as planned by using the full analysis set (FAS). 
The FAS included all randomized patients and was analyzed based on the treatment allocated by the 
interactive voice response system/interactive web response system. 
As a supportive analysis, the primary efficacy endpoint (and co-primary efficacy endpoint in the 
EU, EU reference countries,) was also analyzed using the per-protocol set (PPS). The 
PPS included all patients in the FAS except those patients who had major protocol deviations that were 
deemed to potentially impact the assessment of efficacy. Most of the patients (>90% in each treatment 
group, >95% overall) in the FAS were included in the PPS. 
Outcomes and estimation 
This section discusses the primary/co-primary efficacy endpoints, key secondary efficacy endpoints, and 
other secondary efficacy endpoints of pivotal study R668-AD-1526. 
A hierarchical procedure was used as planned to control the overall Type-I error rate at 0.05 for the primary 
endpoint and the secondary endpoints across the 2 dupilumab dose regimens versus placebo. Each 
hypothesis was formally tested only if the preceding one was significant at the 2-sided 0.05 significance

level. The hierarchical testing order and an overview of the results is shown in Table 19 (all comparisons are 
against the placebo group). The p-value, if not shown, for the efficacy endpoints in the testing hierarchies 
was <0.0001. 
Superiority of dupilumab over placebo was demonstrated for all primary endpoints (IGA 0 or 1, co-primary 
EASI-75 for EU) and key secondary endpoints at week 16 (mean % change in EASI, mean % change in 
weekly average of daily peak pruritus NRS, proportion of patients with NRS reduction ≥3 from baseline, 
proportion of patients with NRS reduction ≥4 from baseline). The pre-specified hierarchical testing 
procedure broke down at the thirty-third endpoint: change from baseline in HADS score at week 16 for the 
dupilumab Q2W dose. The Q2W regimen was numerically superior to the Q4W regimen on most primary and 
key secondary categorical endpoints.

Primary/Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 was the primary endpoint for the US and US-reference 
market countries and a co-primary endpoint for the EU and EU-reference market countries. The proportion 
of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 was the other co-primary endpoint for the EU and EU-reference market 
countries, and a key secondary endpoint for US and US reference market countries. 
Proportion of Patients with IGA 0 or 1 (and a Reduction from Baseline of ≥2 Points) at Week 16 
The proportion of patients in the FAS with IGA 0 or 1 (and reduction from baseline of ≥2 points) at week 16 
was higher in the dupilumab Q2W group (24.4%) and the dupilumab Q4W group (17.9%) than in the 
placebo group (2.4%) (Table 20). Both comparisons were statistically significant and clinically meaningful. 
The dupilumab Q2W treatment group was numerically superior to the dupilumab Q4W treatment group for 
the proportion of patients in the FAS with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 (Table 20).

In a sensitivity analysis using all observed values, with patients with missing values counted as 
non-responders, the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (and reduction from baseline of ≥2 points) at 
week 16 was greater in the dupilumab Q2W treatment group (24.4%) and the dupilumab Q4W group 
(20.2%) than the placebo group (4.7%) (Table 21). Both comparisons were consistent with the primary 
analysis. 
Likewise, the sensitivity analysis using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) was consistent with the 
primary analysis and the sensitivity analysis using all observed values. This showed that them ethodology 
used for handling missing data did not impact the results.

A supportive analysis of the primary endpoint was performed using the PPS. The proportion of patients in the 
PPS with IGA 0 or 1 (and reduction from baseline of ≥2 points) at week 16 was higher in the dupilumab Q2W 
treatment group vs the placebo group (25.3% vs 2.4%, respectively; nominal p<0.0001) and higher for the 
dupilumab Q4W group vs the placebo group (18.2% vs 2.4%, respectively; nominal p=0.0006). 
As shown in Figure 3, the proportion of patients achieving IGA scores of 0 to 1 (and reduction from baseline 
of ≥2 points) was numerically higher in both the dupilumab treatment arms than in the placebo group 
beginning at week 4. The separation was sustained throughout the 16 weeks of the treatment period.

Q2W dosing arm was higher at week 12 compared to the dupilumab Q4W dosing arm (~23% of patients vs 
~15% of patient, respectively) and this numerical superiority of Q2W over Q4W was sustained at week 16.

A supportive analysis of the co-primary endpoint was performed in the PPS. The proportion of patients in the 
PPS with EASI-75 at week 16 was higher in the dupilumab Q2W group vs the placebo group (43.0% vs 8.3%, 
respectively; nominal p<0.0001) and the dupilumab Q4W group vs the placebo group (40.3% vs 8.3%, 
respectively; nominal p<0.0001). As shown in Figure 4, during the study treatment period up to week 16, 
there was a clear separation in the proportion of patients achieving EASI-75 between the dupilumab and 
placebo groups. The first time point during the treatment period at and subsequent to which the dupilumab 
Q2W group was persistently nominally statistically significant compared to the placebo group was at week 3 
(p=0.0025). For the dupilumab Q4W group, this time point was week 2 (p=0.0066). The 2 dose regimens of 
dupilumab tested (ie, Q2W and Q4W) were comparable with respect to this outcome, with the Q2W groups 
having a slightly higher percentage of responders starting at approximately week 8 and remaining as such 
through week 16.

Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Percent Change in EASI Score from Baseline to Week 16 
The mean reduction in EASI score from baseline to week 16 was greater in the dupilumab Q2W group (least 
squares [LS] mean [standard error (SE)] vs baseline, -65.9%, [3.99%]) and dupilumab Q4W group (LS 
mean [SE] vs baseline, -64.8%, [4.51%]), than the placebo group (LS mean [SE] vs baseline, -23.6%, 
[5.49%]) (Table 24). The LS mean difference in percent change from baseline for each of the dupilumab 
treatment groups compared to the placebo group was clinically meaningful and statistically significant. 
The dupilumab Q2W treatment group was comparable to the dupilumab Q4W treatment group for percent 
change in EASI score from baseline to week 16 (Tables 19 and 20).

A sensitivity analysis of percent change from baseline in EASI score at week 16 regardless of rescue 
treatment for the FAS (Table 20) was consistent with the primary analysis. Likewise, the following sensitivity 
analyses conducted in the FAS were also consistent with the primary analysis: LOCF and worst observation 
carried forward (WOCF). This showed that the methodology used for handling missing data did not impact 
the results.

As shown in Figure 6, during the study treatment period up to week 16, there was a clear separation in the 
mean percent change in EASI between the dupilumab and placebo groups. The rapid onset to the effect was 
sustained across the 16-week treatment period. The 2 dose regimens of dupilumab tested were comparable 
with respect to this outcome. Similar results to the primary analysis were observed in analyses performed 
with or without censoring after rescue treatment use.

Percent Change in Weekly Average of Peak Daily Pruritus NRS Score from Baseline to Week 16  
The percent change from baseline to week 16 in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS was greater in 
the dupilumab Q2W group (LS mean [SE] vs baseline, -47.9% [3.43%]) and dupilumab 300 mg Q4W group 
(LS mean [SE] vs baseline, -45.5% [3.54%]) than the placebo group (LS mean [SE] vs baseline, -19.0%

dupilumab Q2W and -26.5% for dupilumab Q4W. The comparisons for each dupilumab group versus the 
placebo group were statistically significant (Table 26). 
The dupilumab Q2W group was comparable to the dupilumab Q4W group for the percent change from

In a sensitivity analysis using all observed values, regardless of whether rescue treatment was used 
or data were collected after study withdrawal, using the MI method, a significant decrease in weekly average 
of peak daily pruritus NRS score from baseline to week 16 was observed in the dupilumab Q2W group (Table 
27). The LS mean difference in percent change from baseline vs placebo was -27.3% for dupilumab Q2W and 
-25.5% for dupilumab Q4W. The comparison of each dupilumab treatment group vs the placebo group was

As shown in Figure 6, during the study treatment period up to week 16, there was a clear separation 
in the percent change in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS score between the dupilumab groups and 
the placebo group. Thus, this effect was rapid and sustained. The 2 dose regimens of dupilumab tested were 
comparable with respect to this outcome.

The proportion of patients achieving a reduction of ≥3 points from baseline in weekly average of peak daily 
pruritus NRS score at week 16 was higher in the dupilumab Q2W group (48.8%) and dupilumab Q4W 
(38.6%) group than in the placebo group (9.4%). Both comparisons were statistically significant.

Proportion of Patients with Improvement (Reduction ≥4 Points) of Weekly Average of Peak 
Daily Pruritus NRS from Baseline to Week 16 
The proportion of patients achieving a reduction of ≥4 points from baseline in weekly average of peak daily 
pruritus NRS score at week 16 was significantly higher in the dupilumab Q2W (36.6%) and dupilumab Q4W 
(26.5%) groups than the placebo group (4.8%). Both comparisons were statistically significant. 
The dupilumab Q2W group was numerically superior to the dupilumab Q4W group for the proportion of 
patients achieving a reduction of ≥4 points from baseline in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS at 
week 16. 
In a sensitivity analysis using all observed values, with patients with missing values counted as 
non-responders, the proportion of patients achieving a reduction of ≥4 points from baseline in weekly 
average of peak daily pruritus NRS score at week 16 was higher in the dupilumab Q2W (42.7%) and 
dupilumab Q4W (39.8%) groups than the placebo group (15.5%). Both comparisons were consistent with 
the primary analysis. 
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Other EASI Endpoints 
Analysis of other secondary EASI endpoints supported the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoint 
results that showed dupilumab monotherapy was more effective than placebo at improving both the severity 
and the extent of AD. The proportion of patients with EASI-50 (≥50% improvement from baseline) at week 
16 was higher in the dupilumab Q2W (61.0%) and dupilumab Q4W groups (54.8%) than in the placebo 
group (12.9%). Both comparisons were statistically significant. The dupilumab Q2W treatment group was 
numerically superior to the dupilumab Q4W group. The proportions of patients achieving EASI-90 (≥90% 
improvement from baseline) at week 16 were higher in the dupilumab Q2W (23.2%) and dupilumab Q4W 
(19.0%) groups than in the placebo group (2.4%). Both comparisons were statistically significant. The 
dupilumab Q2W treatment group was numerically superior to the dupilumab Q4W group. 
During the study treatment period up to week 16, there was a clear separation in the proportion of patients 
achieving EASI-50 between the dupilumab and placebo groups. The proportion of patients achieving 
EASI-50 was greater in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo group at every weekly assessment during 
the study treatment period. The proportion of patients achieving EASI-50 was higher in the Q2W group than 
the Q4W group at week 8 (approximately 68% vs. 58%, respectively) and this numerical superiority of Q2W 
over Q4W was maintained through week 16.  
Similar results to the primary analysis were observed in sensitivity analyses performed using all observed 
values regardless of rescue treatment use and using LOCF. 
During the study treatment period up to week 16, there was a clear separation in the proportion of 
patients achieving EASI-90 between the dupilumab and placebo groups. The first time point during the 
treatment period at and subsequent to which the dupilumab Q2W and Q4W groups were persistently 
nominally significant compared to placebo was at week 4 (p=0.0388 and p=0.0061), respectively. 
Similar results to the primary analysis were observed in sensitivity analyses performed using all observed 
values regardless of rescue treatment use and using LOCF. 
Other Secondary Pruritus NRS Endpoints 
Results of other secondary peak pruritus NRS endpoints supported the results of the key secondary efficacy 
endpoints that demonstrated dupilumab monotherapy was more effective than placebo in reducing the 
weekly average of peak pruritus in AD patients, with effects seen within 4 weeks of treatment. 
The mean baseline weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS score was similar across the 3 treatment 
groups. 
A greater mean change in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS score from baseline to week 16 was 
observed for the dupilumab Q2W group (LS mean [SE] vs baseline, -3.7 [0.250]) and the dupilumab Q4W 
group (LS mean [SE] vs baseline, -3.44 [0.260]) compared to the placebo group (LS mean [SE] vs baseline,

-1.54 [0.303]). The LS mean difference in change from baseline vs placebo was -2.16 (-2.935, -1.389) for 
the dupilumab Q2W group and -1.90 (-2.705, -1.098) for the dupilumab Q4W group. Both comparisons were 
statistically significant. The decrease in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS score from baseline to 
week 16 was comparable for the 2 dupilumab groups. 
The LS mean percent change (SE) in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS score from baseline to week 
4 was -34.7% (2.99) in the dupilumab Q2W group, -33.1% (3.05) in the dupilumab Q4W group and -12.5% 
(3.06) in the placebo group. The LS mean difference in change from baseline vs placebo was -22.2% 
(-30.55, -13.85) for the dupilumab Q2W group and -20.6% (-29.11, -12.14) for the dupilumab Q4W group. 
Both comparisons were statistically significant. The decrease from baseline to week 4 in weekly average of 
peak daily pruritus NRS was comparable between the 2 dose regimens. 
The median time (weeks) to onset of effect on pruritus (time at which 50% of patients in the treatment 
group achieved a ≥3 point reduction of weekly average of peak pruritus NRS from baseline) during the 
16-week treatment period was approximately 5 and 6 weeks for the dupilumab Q2W and dupilumab Q4W 
groups, respectively. mFor the placebo group, less than 50% of patients achieved NRS reduction of at least 
3 points during the 16-week treatment period and hence the median time to onset of effect on pruritus could 
not be computed. Compared to the placebo group, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for reduction of pruritus during 
the 16-week treatment period (≥3 point reduction of NRS from baseline) was 2.249 (1.490 - 3.393) for the 
dupilumab Q2W group and 1.877 (1.240 - 2.843) for the dupilumab Q4W group. Both comparisons were 
statistically significant. The median time to achieve a ≥3 point reduction in weekly average of peak pruritus 
NRS from baseline was comparable for the 2 dupilumab groups. The median time (weeks) to onset of effect 
on pruritus (time at which 50% of patients in the treatment group achieved a ≥4 point reduction of weekly 
average of peak pruritus NRS from baseline) during the 16-week treatment period was approximately 11 
weeks for both dupilumab treatment groups.  For the placebo group, less than 50% of patients achieved 
NRS reduction of at least 4 points during the 16-week treatment period and hence the median time to onset 
of effect on pruritus could not be computed. Compared to the placebo group, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for 
time to onset of effect on pruritus during the 16-week treatment period (≥4 point reduction of NRS from 
baseline) was 2.401 (1.448 - 3.983) for the dupilumab Q2W group and 2.340 (1.411 - 3.882) for the 
dupilumab Q4W group. Both comparisons were statistically significant. 
The median time to achieve a ≥4 point reduction in weekly average of peak pruritus NRS from 
baseline was comparable for the 2 dupilumab groups. 
The proportion of patients achieving improvement (reduction) of weekly average peak dailypruritus NRS of 
≥4 points from baseline to week 4 was higher in the dupilumab Q2W (22.0%) and the dupilumab Q4W 
(20.5%) groups than in the placebo group (4.8%). Both comparisons were nominally statistically significant. 
The proportion of patients achieving improvement (reduction) of weekly average peak daily 
pruritus NRS of ≥4 points from baseline to week 4 was comparable between the 2 dose regimens. 
Other AD Severity and Patient-Reported Outcome Measure Endpoints 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints incorporated additional measurements of AD severity and provided 
further support for the results of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. Results from the pivotal 
phase 3 study in adolescents showed that dupilumab monotherapy was more effective than placebo at 
improving the extent and severity of AD lesions, as assessed by SCORAD and BSA involvement with AD. This 
was demonstrated by larger reductions or percent reductions from baseline in these assessment scores at 
week 16 in the dupilumab groups than the placebo group. The LS mean difference in change or percent 
change from baseline for each assessment score at week 16 was statistically significant when compared to 
placebo for both dose regimens. 
Results of additional patient-reported assessments included as other secondary efficacy endpoints 
demonstrated that dupilumab monotherapy was more effective than placebo at improving primary AD 
symptoms (eg, pruritus, sleep disturbance, skin bleeding, cracking, oozing, flaking, etc), as well as 
health-related quality of life, as assessed by the POEM and CDLQI, respectively. This was demonstrated by 
larger reductions from baseline in these assessment scores at week 16 in the dupilumab groups than the 
placebo group. The LS mean difference in change from baseline for each assessment score at week 16 was 
statistically significant when compared to placebo for both dose regimens.

The pre-specified hierarchical testing procedure broke down at the thirty-third endpoint: change from 
baseline in HADS total score at week 16 for the dupilumab Q2W dose. The mean (SD) baseline HADS total 
score was 12.6 (8.04) for patients in the dupilumab Q2W group, 13.3 (8.17) for patients in the dupilumab 
Q4W group, and 11.6 (7.76) for patients in the placebo group. While numerically a trend towards decreased 
LS mean change in HADS total score was evident for both dupilumab treatment groups, the LS mean 
difference compared to placebo was not significant for the dupilumab Q2W group, but was nominally 
significant for the dupilumab Q4W group (Table 23).

In a post-hoc analysis developed for the SCE, a larger proportion of patients in the dupilumab groups had a 
clinically meaningful reduction in CDLQI total score and POEM total score (each defined as ≥6 point

Ancillary analyses 
Comparison of Results in Subpopulations Within the Phase 3 Pivotal Study 
Subgroup analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were performed on the dataset of 
the phase 3 pivotal study (R668-AD-1526). Subgroup analyses by age, gender, ethnicity, race, duration of 
AD, age of onset of AD, family history of AD, baseline body weight, body mass index (BMI), baseline IGA 
score, baseline EASI score, baseline peak pruritus NRS, baseline BSA involvement in AD, previous use of 
systemic immunosuppressants, previous use of ciclosporin, previous use of MTX, history of asthma, history 
of allergic rhinitis, and history of food allergies were planned and performed for the primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints. Demographic characteristics were analyzed by subgroups of age, gender, 
ethnicity, race, duration of AD, baseline weight group, and overweight determined by baseline BMI. The 
demographics were comparable across the 3 treatment arms at baseline in the FAS. 
Subgroup analyses of baseline characteristics were performed, including age, gender, ethnicity, race, 
duration of AD, age of onset of AD, family history of AD, baseline body weight, BMI, baseline IGA score, 
baseline EASI score, baseline peak NRS, baseline BSA involvement in AD, previous use of systemic 
immunosuppressants, previous use of ciclosporin, previous use of methotrexate, history of asthma, history 
of allergic rhinitis, and history of food allergies. The baseline characteristics were comparable across the 3 
treatment arms in the FAS. 
 In general, the number of patients across the different race categories was too small for meaningful 
conclusions to be drawn, except for White patients. 
In addition, the numbers of patients who had previously used systemic ciclosporin (n = 18 to 20 per 
treatment group) or methotrexate (n = 9 to 19 per treatment group) were too small for meaningful 
conclusions to be drawn. However, the pooled number of patients who had previously used any systemic 
immunosuppressive drug including ciclosporin or methotrexate (n = 40 to 53 per treatment group) was

sufficient to show that dupilumab consistently improved signs and symptoms of AD in this subgroup of 
patients. Key conclusions from the subgroup analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints 
were as follows: 
• Dupilumab (Q2W and Q4W) demonstrated a consistent effect on the proportion of patients who achieved 
IGA of 0 or 1 at week 16 across all subgroups assessed. No interactions (ie, p<0.05) were identified. This 
included consistent results for this endpoint across weight and BMI categories and irrespective of prior use 
of systemic immunosuppressants. 
• Dupilumab (Q2W and Q4W) demonstrated a consistent effect on the proportion of patients who achieved 
EASI-75 at week 16 across all subgroups assessed, except for Q2W in patients with prior exposure to 
ciclosporin. No interactions (ie, p<0.05) were identified, except for the subgroup of patients who had prior 
exposure to ciclosporin, which could have been driven by the small number of patients who had prior 
exposure to ciclosporin. Of note, in patients who had previous exposure to one or more systemic 
non-steroidal immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate-mofetil) 
and/or systemic steroids, (n=40 to 53 per treatment group), both dupilumab dose regimens provided a 
better response than placebo for this endpoint. 
• Dupilumab (Q2W and Q4W) demonstrated a consistent effect on the percent change in EASI score from 
baseline to week 16 across all subgroups. No interactions (ie, p<0.05) were identified, except for the 
subgroups of patients based on duration of AD and prior exposure to ciclosporin. The interaction for the 
subgroup based on prior exposure to ciclosporin could have been driven by the small number of patients who 
had prior exposure to ciclosporin. Of note, in patients who had previous exposure to one or more systemic 
non-steroidal immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate-mofetil) 
and/or systemic steroids, (n=40 to 53 per treatment group), both dupilumab dose regimens provided a 
better response than placebo for this endpoint. 
• Dupilumab (Q2W and Q4W) demonstrated a consistent effect on the percent change in weekly average of 
peak daily pruritus NRS score from baseline to week 16 across all subgroups assessed and no interactions 
(ie, p<0.05) were identified. 
• Dupilumab (Q2W and Q4W) demonstrated a consistent effect on the proportion of patients who achieved 
improvement (reduction of ≥ 3 points) of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to week 
16 across all subgroups, except Q4W in the patients race category of ‘other’. No interactions (ie, p<0.05) 
were identified. This included consistent results for this endpoint across weight and BMI categories and 
irrespective of prior use of systemic immunosuppressants. 
• Dupilumab (Q2W and Q4W) demonstrated a consistent effect on the proportion of patients who achieved 
improvement (reduction of ≥ 4 points) of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to week 
16 across all subgroups, except Q4W in African American patients.  No interactions (ie, p<0.05) were 
identified. This included consistent results for this endpoint across weight and BMI categories and 
irrespective of prior use of systemic immunosuppressants.

Supportive studies 
R668-AD-1607 – Phase 1b, 12-Week Treatment, Open-Label, Autoinjector 
Study 
Study Design 
Study R668-AD-1607 was a phase 1b, multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-part study designed to 
support the registration of dupilumab AI devices in adults and adolescents. The patient population consisted 
of patients ≥12 years with moderate-to-severe AD, whose disease was not adequately controlled with 
topical AD medication (TCS with/without TCIs) or for whom topical AD therapies were otherwise inadvisable 
(eg, because of side effects or safety risks). Approximately 168 patients were planned to be enrolled in the 
study. 
The study consisted of a screening period (4 weeks), treatment period (12 weeks), and post-treatment 
follow-up period (12 weeks). In Part A, patients with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized to receive 
dupilumab 200 mg via AI device or dupilumab 200 mg via PFS, after a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1. In 
Part B, patients with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized to receive dupilumab 300 mg via AI device or 
dupilumab 300 mg via PFS, after a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1. Adolescent patients (≥12 to <18 years 
of age) who completed this study were offered the opportunity to enroll in the pediatric OLE study. 
Since the dupilumab AI devices had not been tested in any clinical settings that would replicate their actual 
use (ie, actual administration of the product repeatedly using the to-be-marketed AI presentation), an 
actual-use study was conducted to support their registration. 
Study objective 
The primary objective of the study was to collect 12 weeks of actual-use data assessing technical 
performance and user interactions of the dupilumab AI device when used by patients (or caregivers for 
injections in upper arms) with AD over a 12-week treatment period. The efficacy of dupilumab administered 
Q2W SC using AI device and PFS in patients with AD was assessed as a secondary objective. 
Concomitant treatments 
All patients used a standardized regimen of TCS using a treatment algorithm specified in the protocol. If 
medically necessary (ie, to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD could have been 
provided to study patients at the discretion of the investigator. This included topical therapies (eg, 
high-potency TCS) or systemic medications like corticosteroids and non-steroidal immunosuppressive drugs 
(eg, ciclsporin, MTX, mycophenolate-mofetil, or azathioprine). 
Efficacy outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy assessments performed were EASI, IGA of AD severity, pruritus NRS, and BSA involvement with AD. 
In this submission, the results for Part A of the study, which included data on the 200 mg dupilumab dose in 
the 1 mL AI up to the cut-off date of 28 Sep 2017, are presented. All patients in Part A had completed the 
end-of-treatment visit at the time of the data cut-off date (28 Sep 2017) and data are provided in the Part 
A CSR included in this dossier. All patients in Part B (300 mg; 2 mL AI) of the study had completed the 
end-of-treatment visit at the time of the data cut-off date for this submission (21 Apr 2018); however, the

data analysis was not complete and, thus, complete results are not presented. All adolescent and adult 
patients from Part A were included in the summary of results submitted in this application. 
Results  
Patient Disposition/ Demographics,  
A total of 85 patients, including 18 adolescents (≥12 to <18 years of age), were enrolled and randomized 
(42 in the AI group, and 43 in the PFS group) in Part A of the study. A total of 78/85 (91.8%) completed 
treatment through day 99 in Part A, and 7 (8.2%) withdrew from treatment; the primary reason of which 
was AE (3 [3.5%] patients). Out of a total of 18 adolescent patients enrolled in the study, 7 patients had 
entered the pediatric OLE study, R668-AD-1434, by the time of the data cut-off date (28 Sep 2017). At the 
time of the data cut-off date for R668-AD-1434 (21 Apr 2018), 11 out of the 18 patients had entered the OLE 
study. 
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
The majority of patients were white (64.3% in the AI group, 76.7% in PFS group); 50.0% were males in the 
AI group, 58.1% were male in the PFS group; the mean (SD) age was 38.9 (19.4) years in the AI group, 33.3 
(16.5) years in the PFS group; the mean (SD) weight was 77.6 (20.3) kg with a weight range of 43.5 to 
122.0 kg in the AI group, 80.2 (26.1) kg with a weight range of 31.7 to 148.7 kg in the PFS group; and the 
mean (SD) BMI was 27.0 (5.5) kg/m2 in the AI group, 27.9 (8.4) kg/m2 in the PFS group. 
Overall, baseline disease characteristics were similar between the AI and PFS groups and consistent with 
moderate-to-severe disease. A significant proportion of patients had disease onset prior to 5 years of age 
(38.1% in the AI group, 48.8% in the PFS group); the mean (SD) duration of AD was 23.3 (18.9) years in 
the AI group, 20.4 (12.4) years in the PFS group; the mean (SD) EASI score was 31.1 (13.1) in the AI group, 
31.0 (12.6) in the PFS group; 50.0% of patients had IGA=3 (moderate disease) and 50.0% had IGA=4 
(severe disease) in the AI group, 51.2% of patients had IGA=3 (moderate disease) and 48.8% had IGA=4 
(severe disease) in the PFS group; the mean (SD) pruritus NRS score was 7.5 (1.6) in the AI group, 7.0 (1.8) 
in the PFS group; and the mean (SD) BSA involvement was 47.2 (24.8) in the AI group, 47.8 (20.7) in the 
PFS group. 
Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
The primary endpoint in the study was the number and type of validated AI device-associated product 
technical failures (PTF) during the treatment period divided by total number of actual injections. The total 
number of actual AI injections included the injections actually taken and the attempted injections which 
failed to be completed due to possible device malfunction, and reported as a product technical complaint 
(PTC). The secondary endpoints included: Number and percentage of patients with an AI device-associated 
PTF; number and type of AI device-associated PTCs divided by total number of actual injections; number and 
percentage of patients with an AI device-associated PTC. 
There were no validated PTFs reported among 322 injections with the 200 mg AI in 42 AD patients, and 333 
injections with the 200 mg PFS in 43 AD patients over 12 weeks.  
There were 6 PTCs for the 200 mg AI device which consisted primarily of failed drug deliveries that resulted 
from user error, and which could be perceived as the patient not receiving the full dose (e.g., releasing the 
AI too early, not waiting for the second click of the AI, not feeling the injection, lifting the AI up too soon, and 
fluid oozing out when the cap was removed).  
There was 1 PTC for the 200 mg PFS device which was a complaint of the needle bending during injection. 
Efficacy Results 
The results from the efficacy parameters for all ages in the study are summarized in Table 6. All efficacy and 
device-related endpoints were evaluated on the modified intent-to treat (mITT) analysis set. The mITT 
population included all randomized patients who received at least 1 injection of study drug.

Both dupilumab 200 mg devices demonstrated efficacy across multiple clinical outcomes, reflecting 
improvements in objective signs of AD and pruritus. Efficacy endpoints (percent change from baseline in 
weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS and EASI scores [continuous variables] and proportion of patients 
with reduction of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS ≥3 from baseline) between the AI and PFS 
treatment groups were comparable with overlapping95% CIs around the point estimates. 
Overall, the efficacy results with both devices were consistent with the magnitude of efficacy seen in other 
AD studies with dupilumab.

R668-AD-1434 – Phase 3, 104-Week Treatment, Open-Label Extension Study 
Study Design 
Study R668-AD-1434 was a phase 3, OLE study investigating the long-term safety, efficacy, PK, and 
immunogenicity of repeat monthly SC doses of dupilumab in pediatric patients with AD who had previously 
completed a clinical study with dupilumab in patients with AD. The patient population consisted of pediatric 
patients ≥6 months to <18 years of age with AD who participated in a prior clinical study of dupilumab in AD 
(including R668-AD-1412, R688-AD-1607, and R668-AD-1526). 
The first-step CSR focuses on data from patients aged ≥12 to <18 years only, in order to support the 
application for dupilumab in adolescents with AD.  
Methods/Study objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the long-term safety of dupilumab in pediatric patients with 
AD. Long-term efficacy was evaluated as a secondary objective. The study consisted of a screening period 
(day -28 to day -1), a treatment period up to the time of regional regulatory approval, and a 12-week 
follow-up period. 
Under the original protocol (published on 04 May 2015), the dose regimen for patients ≥12 years to <18 
years old was 2 mg/kg QW or 4 mg/kg QW. Under protocol amendment 1 (published on 27 Mar 2017), the 
dose regimen for patients ≥12 years to <18 years old was changed from weekly weight-based dosing (2 
mg/kg or 4 mg/kg) to a fixed dose regimen of 300 mg Q4W. The dose was up-titrated in case of inadequate 
clinical response at week 16 as follows: 
• Patients weighing ≥60 kg: 300 mg Q2W 
• Patients weighing <60 kg: 200 mg Q2W 
Inadequate clinical response was defined as failure to achieve an IGA score of 0 or 1 (disease severity of 
“almost clear”, or “clear”) for at least 16 weeks from the date of initiation of treatment with the 300 mg Q4W 
regimen. Patients were up-titrated to the Q2W earlier than 16 weeks when the Q2W regimen was 
administered as rescue treatment, or later than 16 weeks (as long as they had received at least 16 weeks of 
treatment with Q4W regimen). 
Concomitant treatments 
The use of topical medication for AD (including TCS and TCIs) was permitted during the study. It was 
recommended that investigators should select the potency based on the age of the patient, severity of 
disease and affected region, and that use be consistent with local guidelines.  
The use of TCIs was reserved for areas of the body that were more prone to side effects from TCS use (eg, 
face, intertriginous, and genital areas). If medically necessary (ie, to control intolerable AD symptoms), 
rescue treatment for AD could be provided to study patients at the discretion of the investigator. This 
included topical therapies (eg, high-potency TCS) or systemic medications like corticosteroids and 
non-steroidal immunosuppressive drugs (eg, ciclosporin, MTX, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy assessments included EASI, IGA of AD severity, pruritus NRS, SCORAD, BSA involvement with AD, 
POEM, CDLQI, assessment of AD flares, and maintenance of treatment effect. Pruritus NRS and POEM 
assessments were removed from the study in protocol amendment 1. Therefore, pruritus NRS and POEM 
data were summarized only for patients who consented to the original protocol (n=36).

The efficacy results presented in the first-step CSR included in support of this subsequent marketing 
application focused on patients who rolled over from R668-AD-1412 and received weight-based dosing (2 
mg/kg QW or 4 mg/kg QW) under the original protocol (n=36), for the duration of the study during which 
they received weight-based dosing (note: from amendment 1 onwards, these patients were switched to a 
fixed dose [300 mg Q4W followed by up-titration in case of inadequate response][]; the efficacy analysis 
does not include the period when these patients received the fixed dose). The reasons for this approach are 
as follows:  
1. The key efficacy objective of this OLE study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of dupilumab. At the 
time of the data cut-off date for the first-step analysis of (21 Apr 2018) all the patients that had completed 
at least 52 weeks were enrolled from the R668-AD-1412 study. 
2. Patients who rolled over from R668-AD-1412 received weight-based dosing (2 mg/kg QW or 4 mg/kg QW) 
for a significant duration (median duration of treatment exposure was around 89 weeks), before being 
switched to a fixed dose (300 mg Q4W) under amendment 1. In contrast, patients who rolled over from 
R668-AD-1526 and R668-AD-1607 received the fixed dose from the time they enrolled into the study. 
3. Focusing on patients with weight-based dosing allowed evaluation of efficacy results in the OLE study from 
a dose regimen that provided exposure that was equivalent to the dose planned to be proposed for approval 
in adolescent patients (200/300 mg Q2W). 
Patient Disposition/ Demographics/ Baseline Disease Characteristics 
A total of 275 adolescent patients were enrolled in this study: 36 from study R668-AD-1412, 201 from study 
R668-AD-1526, and 38 from study R668-AD-1607 (see Table 1).  
Overall, 4 patients discontinued treatment for the following reasons: withdrawal by patient (2/4), lost to 
follow-up (1/4), and physician decision (1/4)  
Of the 275 patients enrolled in this study, the majority of patients were white (69.5%). Male and female 
patients represented 58.9% and 41.1% of the population, respectively; the mean (SD) age was 14.6 (1.7) 
years, mean (SD) weight was 65.0 (20.6) kg with a weight range from 32.2 to 149.0 kg, and a mean (SD) 
BMI of 24.2 (6.1) kg/m2.  
A number of patients had disease onset prior to 1 year of age (18.9%). The mean (SD) duration of AD was 
12.5 (3.2) years. At the baseline of the OLE study, the mean (SD) EASI score was 19.9 (15.4); overall, 
49.5% of patients had IGA=3 (moderate disease) and 23.3% had IGA=4 (severe disease); and the mean 
(SD) BSA involvement was 34.2% (25.3). 
In the subgroup of 36 patients who rolled over from R668-AD-1412 and received weight-based dosing under 
the original protocol, the majority of patients were white (88.9%). Male and female patients represented 
47.2% and 52.8% of the population, respectively; the mean (SD) age was 14.5 (1.9) years, mean (SD) 
weight was 55.1 (12.0) kg with a weight range from 35.0 to 81.7 kg, and a mean (SD) BMI of 21.0 (3.7) 
kg/m2. The number of patients who had disease onset prior to 1 year of age was 44.4%. 
 The mean (SD) duration of AD was 12.6 (2.9) years. At the baseline of the OLE study, the mean (SD) EASI 
score was 23.4 (17.6); overall, 61.1% of patients had IGA=3 (moderate disease) and 25.0% had IGA=4 
(severe disease); the mean (SD) pruritus NRS score was 4.9 (2.8) and the mean (SD) BSA involvement was 
38.3% (26.0). 
The mean (SD) duration of time that patients were off treatment before starting in the OLE study was 61.8 
(50.08) days for the total patient population (n=275) and 136.8 (54.5) days for the subgroup of 36 patients 
who rolled over from R668-AD-1412 and received weight-based dosing. 
 If patients had a treatment gap of <6 weeks, they were expected to maintain concentrations of dupilumab 
in serum that were sufficient to maintain target saturation during the transition. If patients had a treatment 
gap >13 weeks, concentrations of dupilumab in serum were expected to be undetectable at time of 
enrollment into the OLE study.  
If patients had a treatment gap between 6 and 13 weeks, the concentration of dupilumab in serum was 
expected to fall below the level of target saturation but still remain above the lower limit of quantitation. The 
majority of patients in the total study population (113), and all 36 patients in the subgroup of patients who

rolled over from R668-AD-1412 and received weight-based dosing, had a treatment gap of at least 6 weeks 
before entering into the OLE and this could be one of the factors explaining the relatively high disease 
severity at baseline of the OLE study. 
Topical immunosuppressants were permitted concomitant medications during the study. A total of 176/275 
(64.0%) of patients used TCS and 33/275 (12.0%) used TCI during the study. 
Efficacy Results 
Efficacy analyses were performed using the safety analysis set (SAF), which included all patients who 
received any study drug. 
Efficacy Results in the Total Study Population (N=275) 
At the time of the first-step analysis, of the 275 adolescent patients enrolled in the study, 142 patients had 
completed 16 weeks, 69 patients had completed 26 weeks, and 34 patients had completed at least 52 weeks 
of treatment period. 
The efficacy data from the overall study population of 275 patients demonstrated a substantial clinical 
benefit of dupilumab to adolescent patients, as shown by improvements in the proportion of patients who 
achieved IGA 0 or 1, and the proportion of patients who achieved EASI-50, EASI-75 and EASI-90 relative to 
the parent study baseline (Table 28).

Efficacy Results in the Subgroup of Patients who Rolled Over from R668-AD-1412 and 
Received Weight-based Dosing Under the Original Protocol (N=36) 
A total of 25/36 (69.4%) of patients used TCS and 10/36 (27.8%) used TCI during the study. 
Key efficacy endpoint results for the study are summarized in Table 9. Dupilumab provided substantial and 
sustained clinical benefit to adolescent patients as measured by both investigator-assessed and 
patient-reported outcomes.  
This was shown by the proportion of patients achieving IGA 0 or 1 (0/36 (0%) at baseline, 15/36 (41.7%) 
at week 16, 14/34 (41.2%) at week 52) and EASI-75 (2/36 (5.6%) at baseline, 25/36 (69.4%) at week 16 
and 28/34 (82.4%) at week 52). The reduction in mean percentage EASI score from baseline of previous 
study was 28.6% at baseline of OLE, 81.9% at week 16 and 84.5% at week 52. The reduction in mean 
percentage pruritus NRS score from baseline of previous study was 21.7% at baseline of OLE, 63.9% at 
week 16 and 67.2% at week 52 (Table 30).

[1] The median percent change was used because the distribution for percent change in EASI score from 
baseline of the OLE study was skewed and not normally distributed. Hence, the median was a better 
indicator of central tendency. 
Note: the efficacy analysis does not include the period when these patients switched to the fixed dose of 300 
mg Q4W under amendment 1. 
2/36 patients discontinued from the study prior to week 52.  By week 104, 17 patients had transitioned from 
weight based dosing to a fixed dose, after re-consenting to protocol amendment 1.  Since this table only 
provided data for patients who received weight based dosing under the original protocol, these patients were 
excluded from the original analysis set.

Proportion of Patients with IGA 0 or 1 at Each Visit 
At baseline of the OLE, none of the patients who rolled over from study R668-AD-1412 had an IGA score of 
0 or 1. This is expected because these patients had a treatment interruption of at least 8 weeks between the 
last  dose  in  the  R668-AD-1412  and  the  baseline  of  the  OLE.  At  week  16,  a  considerable  proportion  of 
patients (15/36 [41.7%]) had achieved IGA 0 or 1. 
Response rates at later time points, though somewhat variable due to the small patient numbers analyzed, 
were comparable to those at week 16, suggesting sustained efficacy of dupilumab treatment. The variability 
in  response  rates  between  week  52  and  week  76  also  resulted  from  patients  with  remission  being 
discontinued from study drug at week 52, losing remission during the period of treatment interruption, and 
then re-gaining remission once study drug was re-initiated around week 64. 
Data after week 88 should be interpreted with caution as the number of patients included in the analysis 
progressively decreased after this time point (as patients transitioned to fixed dosing after re consenting to

protocol amendment 1). (Note - when the term “fixed dosing” is used this refers to a dose regimen of 300 mg 
Q4W followed by up-titration to Q2W [200 mg or 300 mg] regimen in some patients)().

As per study protocol, patients who achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 for a 12-week period leading up to week 
52 were discontinued from study drug. Once these patients were discontinued from study drug, disease 
activity was closely monitored, and dupilumab was re-initiated if these patients had a relapse of disease 
defined as IGA score ≥2. At the time of data cut-off date for this submission (21 Apr 2018), 14 patients who 
achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 for a 12-week period after week 40 were discontinued from study drug. In 
12 of the 14 patients, the disease returned and treatment had to be re-initiated, demonstrating the need for 
continuous treatment with dupilumab. The median time to re-initiation of study drug was 16 weeks.

Percentages were calculated based on number of patients who completed week 52. 
As per updated OLE data (Data cut off Dec 2018) at baseline 27 out of 299 patients enrolled (9.0%) had an 
IGA score of 0 or 1. These patients came from the pivotal phase 3 study R668-AD-1526. At Week 16, a 
considerably higher proportion of patients (77/295 [26.1%]) had achieved IGA 0 or 1. There was a trend 
towards  numerically  higher  response  rates  at  Week  52  as  compared  to  Week  16  with  46/107  (43.4%) 
patients achieving IGA 0/1.

At week 16, a considerable proportion of patients (25/36 [69.4%]) had achieved EASI-75. Response rates at 
later time points were comparable to that at week 16, suggesting sustained efficacy of dupilumab treatment.   
The variability in response rates between week 52 and week 76 also resulted from patients with remission 
being discontinued from study drug at week 52, losing remission during the period of treatment interruption, 
and then re-gaining remission once study drug was re-initiated around week 64. 
Data after week 88 should be interpreted with caution as the number of patients included in the analysis 
progressively decreased after this time point (as patients transitioned to fixed dosing after re consenting to 
protocol amendment 1).

Summary of Sustained Remission Defined by IGA 
At the time of data cut-off, 34 of the 36 patients who rolled over from study R668-AD-1412 completed week 
52, and 14 of these 34 patients (41.2%) obtained sustained remission from AD. 
Sustained remission was defined as maintenance of an IGA score of 0 or 1 for a 12-week period, after week 
40. Once sustained remission was reached, the patients were discontinued from study drug, disease activity 
was closely monitored, and dupilumab was re-initiated if these patients had a relapse of disease defined as 
IGA score ≥2.  
In  12  of  the  14  patients  who  achieved  sustained  remission,  the  disease  returned  and  treatment  was 
re-initiated,  demonstrating  the  need  for  continuous  treatment  with  dupilumab.  The  median  time  to 
re-initiation is shown below. 16 weeks

Summary of Sustained Remission Defined by IGA 0 or 1 for ≥12 Weeks - Adolescent ≥12 to <18 
Years of Age (SAF – Under Original Protocol) 
Disease activity was monitored in the patients in whom study drug was re-initiated (n=12). 
Efficacy data subsequent to study drug re-initiation was available for 10 out of these 12 patients at the date 
of the data cut-off for this first-step analysis CSR. Overall, 8 out of these 10 patients achieved an IGA score 
of 0 or 1 after re-initiation of study drug. 
Summary of Patients with Up-Titration of Dupilumab  
Per  protocol,  patients  could  be  up-titrated  from  300  mg  Q4W  to  a  200/300  mg  Q2W  dose  in  case  of 
inadequate clinical response. Inadequate clinical response was defined as failure to achieve an IGA score of 
0  or  1  (disease  severity  of  “almost  clear”  or  “clear”)  at  or  after  16  weeks  from  the  date  of  initiation  of 
treatment  with  300  mg  Q4W  regimen.  Patients  could  also  be  up-titrated  earlier  than  16  weeks  also    if 
investigator felt that the patient needed a rescue treatment due to high disease severity (IGA score of at 
least 3). Patients could be up-titrated as follows: 
1. Patients weighing ≥60 kg: 300 mg Q2W 
2. Patients weighing <60 kg: 200 mg Q2W  
Of the 275 patients, 268 patients received at least 1 Q4W dose. The number of patients who had already 
been up-titrated by the time of this first-step analysis was 141/268 (52.6%). Importantly, 97/268 (36.2%) 
patients needed to be rescued with dupilumab Q2W regimen, as per judgement of the study investigator, 
prior  to  completion  of  16  weeks  of  treatment  with  Q4W  regimen  as  they  experienced  either  intolerable 
symptoms or high disease severity This suggests that the study investigator considered the Q4W regimen 
was suboptimal for a substantial proportion of patients.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design/endpoints/study population of the pivotal study R668-AD-1526 
The primary objective of the pivotal study R668-AD-1526 was to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab as 
a monotherapy after 16 weeks of treatment in patients ≥12 to <18 years of age with moderate-to-severe 
AD.  
The co-primary endpoints were defined as proportions of patients with EASI-75 (≥75% improvement from 
baseline) at week 16 and proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale) at week 16. EASI is 
deemed to provide a realistic assessment of clinical AD symptoms and as it indicates good overall evidence 
of reliability in rating AD subjects.  
Key secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with EASI-75 (≥75% improvement from baseline) 
at week 16 (not in the EU, see co-primary endpoint), percent change in EASI score from baseline to week 16, 
percent change from baseline to week 16 in weekly average of daily peak Pruritus NRS, proportion of 
patients with improvement (reduction) of weekly average of daily peak Pruritus NRS ≥3 from baseline at 
week 16 and proportion of patients with improvement (reduction) of weekly average of daily peak Pruritus 
NRS ≥4 from baseline at week 16. 
The co-primary and key secondary endpoints, including standard efficacy variables like the EASI-75 and IGA 
0 or 1 which represent a sufficient degree of improvement, are considered adequate and in line with the 
objectives of this study. 
The eligibility criteria of the pivotal study R668-AD-1526 including the definition of inadequate response to 
topical treatments are endorsed.  
240 patients assigned to three different dose groups (200/300 mg Q2W dependent of bodyweight or 300 mg 
Q4W or placebo Q2W) over a treatment period of 16 weeks were planned for the pivotal study including the 
opportunity to join a subsequent open-label extension study (OLE R-668-AD-1434). Concomitant therapy 
was only applicable as rescue therapy to avoid bias regarding the efficacy outcome. Handling of 
non-responders is endorsed. In general, a shorter monotherapy treatment and thus placebo period (i.e. 
reduction to 16 weeks treatment period as agreed in the above mentioned PIP modification) is considered 
acceptable and sufficient to establish the efficacy also from an ethical point of view. 
Concerning the protocol amendments introduced changes were based on PIP modifications and approved by 
PDCO. The protocol amendments are considered to be without adverse influence to the efficacy results. 
Hence, the study design, the endpoints, the patient population and the treatment are considered to be 
adequately chosen to demonstrate effects of dupilumab treatment in the proposed indication as they are in 
line with PDCO’s decisions.  
An analysis of major protocol deviations and their impact on study participation and efficacy and safety 
results, respectively, was requested. As the sponsor states, the overall rate of protocol deviations in the 
study was comparable to that seen in adult phase 3 SOLO trials. This is reassuring as in pediatric trials, given 
the higher complexity of study procedures including gathering of informed consent/assent, there is a 
potential to have higher incidence of PDs. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of 
major PDs on the efficacy results on the co-primary endpoints. In this Per protocol analysis (PP), patients 
with major protocol deviations were excluded. Results from this analysis were consistent with the Intention 
to Treat (ITT) analysis in which all randomized patients were included in the CSR. This analysis is considered 
acceptable and the issue is resolved. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Participant flow/Demographics 
R668-AD-1526 
The participant flow shows that nearly all randomized patients of the individual dose groups received their 
study treatment. 6.6% (11/166) of the patients treated with dupilumab did not complete the study

treatment, thereof showed 1 patient lack of efficacy in the 300 mg Q4W group, the remaining 6 patients with 
lack of efficacy were assigned to the placebo group. 80% of the patients of this pivotal study transitioned into 
the OLE study R668-AD-1434. All other aspects such as discontinuation rate, patient withdrawals etc. were 
balanced between the treatment groups.  
The demographics were fairly balanced between the treatment groups with a preponderance of white (63%) 
and male study participants (59%). The majority of patients had a disease manifestation below the age of 5 
years (85%) and the mean (SD) duration of AD was 12.2 years. 
Baseline disease characteristics were relatively balanced, IGA scores of 3 (moderate disease) and 4 (severe 
disease) were 46% and 53.8%, respectively, and EASI 35.3-35-5. All other AD assessments like mean (SD) 
pruritus NRS score was 7.6 (1.66) and the mean (SD) BSA involvement was 56.5% (22.97), BSA etc. were 
well-balanced, too. Most patients had comorbid allergic conditions; these were evenly distributed across the 
different treatment groups. Overall, demographics and baseline disease characteristics were similar 
between the 3 treatment groups.  
The mean injection compliance was high overall (>97.5% in each treatment group) and was similar across 
the 3 treatment groups. 
Concomitant/Rescue medication 
R668-AD-1526 
A third of the patients had prior systemic corticosteroid use and 21% had received systemic 
immunosuppressant therapy which reflects the disease severity of the population (ciclosporin and 
methotrexate were received in 12.8% and 10.4%, respectively).  
The highest need of rescue medication was recorded in the placebo group (59%), followed by the 300 mg 
Q4W group (32%) and then by the 200/300 mg Q2W group (21%). These results are comparable with the 
need of rescue medication during study R668-AD-1334 (SOLO 1, adult AD monotherapy study). Systemic 
corticosteroids were taken by 2 subjects (2.4%) of the 200/300 mg Q2W group compared to 5.9% of the 
placebo group and hence, are to be counted as non-responders from the time of rescue medication use. 
Systemic immunosuppressants were only administered in the placebo group (3.5%). 
Approximately 15 % of the 200/300 mg dose group, which is the intended dose for the claimed indication, 
had used any rescue medication by treatment week 16. The company allowed for use of rescue medications 
during the study and prior to achievement of the primary endpoint, they were considered as non-responders 
for the analyses. Results of different sensitivity analyses showed that the methods of analyses including the 
methodology of data handling after rescue medication did not impact the results as both doses of dupilumab 
showed statistical significance (p <0.05) over placebo. Results of sensitivity analyses of R668-AD-1434, 
-1412 and -1607 were consistent with that obtained by the primary analyses. 
Outcome/ Endpoints 
Co-primary endpoints 
In the study R668-AD-1526 the proportion of patients in the FAS with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 was significantly 
higher in the dupilumab 200/300 mg Q2W (24.4%) and dupilumab 300 mg Q4W groups (17.9%) than the 
placebo group (2.4%). The comparisons were statistically significant (p<0.0001 for each group).  
Efficacy analyses regarding the co-primary endpoint revealed a significantly higher EASI-75 at week 16 in 
the dupilumab treatment groups (41.5% and 38.1%) compared with the placebo group (8.2%). 
Sensitivity analyses using all observed values with patients with missing values counted as non-responders 
showed similar results. 
Patients receiving the Q4W regimen initially showed a slightly higher response rate than patients assigned to 
the Q2W dose groups until week 9, however, the lines crossed around week 9 and the latter showed a higher 
treatment efficacy from week 9 until week 16. These efficacy results show a clinically meaningful 
improvement of AD symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe disease conditions. 
Key secondary endpoints 
Percent change in EASI score from baseline to week 16 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 115/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The LS mean difference in percent change from baseline for each of the dupilumab treatment groups 
compared to the placebo group was clinically meaningful and statistically significant and both dupilumab 
treatment groups were comparable with regard to the percent change in EASI score from baseline to week 
16. 
Percent Change in Weekly Average of Peak Daily Pruritus NRS Score from Baseline to Week 16 
The percent change from baseline to week 16 in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS was greater in 
the dupilumab Q2W group (-47.9% [3.43%]) and dupilumab 300 mg Q4W group (-45.5% [3.54%]) than 
the placebo group (-19.0% [4.09%]) (Table 26). The comparisons for each dupilumab group versus the 
placebo group were statistically significant. Both treatment groups were comparable for the percent change 
from baseline in weekly average of peak pruritus NRS at week 16.  
The Peak Pruritus NRS is considered a well-defined and reliable patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure for 
evaluating itch intensity of AD patients providing a significant informative value of treatment response.  
Similarly, the Proportion of Patients with Improvement (Reduction ≥3 Points) of Weekly Average of Peak 
Daily Pruritus NRS from Baseline to Week 16 was higher in the dupilumab Q2W group (48.8%) and 
dupilumab Q4W (38.6%) group than in the placebo group (9.4%) with statistical significance Patients 
showing an improvement of weekly average of daily peak Pruritus NRS ≥4 from baseline at week 16 . and 
the proportion of patients achieving a reduction of ≥4 points from baseline in weekly average of peak daily 
pruritus NRS score at week 16 prevailed again in the dupilumab Q2W (36.6%) and dupilumab Q4W (26.5%) 
groups compared to placebo group (4.8%). As to both secondary endpoints, the Q2W group was numerically 
superior to the dupilumab Q4W group. The proportion of patients achieving an EASI-50 was significantly 
higher in the dupilumab treatment groups than in the placebo group. Additionally, the other efficacy 
endpoints that were assessed support the favourable efficacy compared to placebo. 
The results from the studies R668-AD-1526 show a significant higher and clinically meaningful improvement 
in severity of AD in the dupilumab 300 mg Q4W and 200/300 mg Q2W groups compared to placebo 
substantiated by achievement of the co-primary endpoints, whereby the Q2W regimen yields better results 
in the analysed treatment effects. Hence, the key secondary endpoints support the effects seen in the 
co-primary endpoints and show a significant reduction of disease burden.  
As  an  active  comparator  was  not  used  in  the  trial  it  is  not  known  how  the  therapy  would  compare  to 
Tacrolimus or other systemic therapies in a systemic treatment naïve population. Furthermore the longer 
term and maintenance of effect was not measured in this study as patients were enrolled into the open label 
study R668-AD-1434. It is also known that seasons may affect the AD flairs the applicant should clarify the 
season in which patients were enrolled and treated, this would not have been controlled for at the trial was 
not for 52 weeks. 
Subgroup analyses 
A variety of subgroup analyses was performed. The demographics and the baseline characteristics were 
comparable across the 3 treatment arms in the FAS. The number of patients across the different race 
categories was too small for meaningful conclusions to be drawn, the same applies to prior ciclosporin/MTX 
use. 
Dupilumab (Q2W and Q4W) demonstrated a consistent effect on key primary and secondary endpoints 
across all subgroups with exception of the proportion of patients who achieved EASI-75 at week 16 as well 
as for Q2W in patients with prior exposure to ciclosporin; however, general use of systemic 
immunosuppressive medication during dupilumab therapy was minimal and dupilumab showed consistently 
improved signs and symptoms of AD in this subgroup. 
Supportive studies 
R668-AD-1412 
Of the 40 included patients included in study R668-AD-1412 [phase 2a, multicenter, open-label, 
ascending-dose, sequential-cohort study investigating the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and 
efficacy of a single dose (2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg) of dupilumab administered SC followed by repeat-doses of the 
same doses weekly for 4 weeks in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe AD (for adolescents ≥12 to 
<18 years of age) or severe AD (for pediatric patients ≥6 to <12 years of age) that was not

adequately  controlled  with  topical  treatments)],  the  majority  (95%)  completed  the  treatment  and  most 
patients (97.5%) transitioned into the OLE study, thereof 10 % into the adult OLE study. The patients were 
assigned to one of 2 dose cohorts (2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg). During Part A of the study, patients received a 
single SC dose, followed by an 8-week semi-dense PK sampling period. During Part B of the study, patients 
received 4 weekly SC doses, followed by an 8-week follow-up period. Demographics were similar across age 
groups  and  dose  cohorts.  Baseline  AD  characteristics  differed  between  the  2  age  groups,  as  expected. 
However, within each age group, baseline AD characteristics were similar across dose cohorts. 
The  efficacy  data  showed  that  Dupilumab  administered  as  a  single  dose  of  either  2  mg/kg  or  4  mg/kg 
induced significant and rapid reduction of disease activity in patients at week 2 (34% and 51% reduction in 
EASI score from baseline for 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg doses respectively). Repeated weekly doses of dupilumab 
led to a further improvement in disease severity in patients in both dose cohorts (67% and 70% reduction 
in EASI score from baseline for 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg doses respectively at week 12).  
Improvement  in  the  other  efficacy  endpoints  such  as  percent  change  from  baseline  in  SCORing  Atopic 
Dermatitis (SCORAD) score, percent change from baseline in Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and 
percentage of patients with an IGA score of 0 or 1 and the change from baseline in % BSA affected by AD was 
were noted. The data showed that statistically significant responses were seen by week 8 and reached a 
maximum at week 12. Following withdrawal of treatment during the follow up period the effects persisted by 
were diminished from week 12 to week 20. 
There were no systematic differences in the efficacy observed within the 2 age sub-groups that were studied 
in the adolescent population (≥12 to <15 and ≥15 to <18 years of age). This was expected as the exposure 
was normalized by the weight based dosing and there is no evidence in the literature to suggest that that 
disease pathophysiology is different between these subgroups. 
However, there are limitations with the study as it was relatively small 40 adolescent patients and for only 
12 weeks duration. More significantly, patients were allowed to use concomitant medications such as topical 
TCS or TCI or oral medications when needed, this would have confounded the results.    As the trial was 
exploratory,  low  patient  numbers  and  relatively  short  duration  is  not  considered  to  further  pursue 
comparative efficacy in patients who did not receive any rescue medication. 
In Study R668-AD-1607, the potential effect of drug product presentation (PFP or PFS) on dupilumab PK was 
investigated. In this study, patients with moderate to severe AD received dupilumab 200 mg q2w via PFP 
device or PFS, with a loading dose of 400 mg on Day 1. The study was not formally powered to show PK 
comparability/bioequivalence between PFS and PFP. The primary endpoint in the study was the number and 
type of validated AI device-associated product technical failures (PTF) during the treatment period divided 
by total number of actual injections. The comparison of systemic dupilumab exposure between PFS and PFP 
was included as secondary objective in the study. R668-AD-1607 data has previously been submitted to 
support an extension of application in adult and adolescent asthma patients to include a new 200 mg 
strength (EMEA/H/C/004390/X/04/G). The bioequivalence of the PFP compared to the PFS was questioned 
and resolved with updated information. 
OLE study R668-AD-1434 (An ongoing open label extension study to assess the long term safety and efficacy 
of Dupilumab in patients ≥ 6 months to ≤18 years with atopic dermatitis) recruited patients from studies 
R668-AD-1526, R668-AD-1607 and R668-AD-1412. Included patients were treated with 2 mg/kg QW or 4 
mg/kg  QW,  the  dose  was subsequently  amended  to a  fixed  dose of  300  mg  Q4W  with  the  possibility  of 
up-titration to 200/300 mg Q2W dependent on the bodyweight in case of inadequate clinical response at 
week 16. Q4W  Concomitant topical medication was allowed. Efficacy assessments included EASI, IGA of AD 
severity, pruritus NRS, SCORAD, BSA involvement with AD, POEM, CDLQI, assessment of AD flares, and 
maintenance  of  treatment  effect.  The  presented  efficacy  results  are  based  and  focused  on  patients 
stemming from parent study R668-AD-1412 (n=36) which received a stable weight-based dose regimen 
over 22 months on average. According to the MAH this approach was chosen to minimize bias caused by 
administration of different dose regimens (intra- and inter-patient dosing) during the other parent studies 
R668-AD-1526 and R668-AD-1607.

A first-step analysis was conducted on data from adolescent patients (≥12 to <18 years old) enrolled in this 
study, with a data cut-off date of 21 Apr 2018. At the time of the first-step analysis, of the 275 adolescent 
patients enrolled in the study, 142 had completed 16 weeks, 69 had completed 26 weeks, and 34 patients 
had completed at least 52 weeks of treatment. This clinical study report is focused on adolescent patients. 
34 of the included 275 patients have completed 52 treatment weeks. Thereof 41.2% (14/34) reached the 
co-primary endpoints by achieving IGA 0 or 1; the proportion of patients with EASI-75 relative to baseline of 
the previous study was 82.4% (28/34). The majority (76%) applied concomitant topical TCS/TCI.The 
proportions reaching the co-primary endpoints were higher after week 16 than during the pivotal study 
R668-AD-1526 which is explicable by several influencing factors as residual dupilumab concentrations 
resulting from the treatments obtained during the parent studies, higher disease severity at baseline of 
study R668-AD-1526 as compared to baseline of study R668-AD-1434, concomitant topical medication 
during R668-AD-1434 , study design, data set etc.. Efficacy results of the requested updated subgroup 
analysis on the co-primary endpoints showed lower treatment effects regarding the achievement of IGA 
score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 in obese patients, in patients who had received a previous therapy with systemic 
immunosuppressants and in those presenting higher eosinophil counts at baseline suggesting a higher 
disease activity. These conditions, however, did not influence the dupilumab treatment effect on the 
proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16.     
The majority of patients applied TCS with a moderate potency during all three studies and the number of 
patients on topic medication for AD decreased over time during study R668-AD-1412. The mean duration of 
TCS during the treatment period was lower in the dupilumab 200/300 mg Q2W group than in the 300 mg 
Q4W and the placebo group suggesting a better efficacy. During pivotal study R668-AD-1526 patients in the 
dupilumab  groups  needed  rescue  medication  to  a  lesser  extent  than  the  placebo  group.  Based  on  the 
different study designs the confounding effect of concomitant medication on efficacy is non-existent (1526) 
or not separable. 
Rescue therapy was allowed if medically necessary (ie, to control intolerable AD symptoms, treatment of 
flares  of  disease,  etc)  to  study  patients  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator.    It  was  recommended  that 
investigators performed an IGA assessment prior to starting rescue treatment and initiate rescue treatment 
only in patients with an IGA score ≥3.  
The Applicant reported that 16 patients required rescue therapy (5.8%) of which 12 (4.4%) used systemic 
corticosteroids. The provided data show that all of the 16 patients received at least temporarily the 300 mg 
Q4W regimen and nearly all patients (14/16) were switched to the higher dose regimen (300 mg Q2W), 
suggesting the need for a higher exposure. patients  The proportion of patients that needed up-titration of 
dupilumab from the previous Q4W regimen to the weight-based Q2W regimen (36.2% until week 16) 
reflects higher dupilumab concentrations were needed to control disease activity in this AD patient 
population 
More long-term continuous data would have been available if patients had been enrolled without treatment 
interruption to show maintenance of effect and also whether patients whom did not receive IGA0/1 achieved 
better efficacy with continued treatment. 
As per study protocol, patients who achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 for a 12-week period leading up to week 
52 were discontinued from study drug. Once these patients were discontinued from study drug, disease 
activity was closely monitored, and dupilumab was re-initiated if these patients had a relapse of disease 
defined as IGA score ≥2. At the time of data cut-off date for this submission (21 Apr 2018), 14 patients who 
achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 for a 12-week period after week 40 were discontinued from study drug. In 
12 of the 14 patients, the disease returned and treatment had to be re-initiated, demonstrating the need for 
continuous treatment with dupilumab. The median time to re-initiation of study drug was 16 weeks. While 
the company showed that AD will flare again as the median time was 16 weeks, in some patients continuous 
therapy  may  not  be  required  further  clarification  was  requested  from  the  applicant  and  this  should  be 
reflected in the SPC. The applicant does not recommend the treatment strategy of treatment interruption 
with up to 12 weeks duration. The analysis performed by the applicant indicated that after 8 weeks, the 
patients had lost around 25% of the response achieved from treatment with dupilumab. The justification 
provided  by  the  applicant  can  be  accepted.  There  are  insufficient  data  to  recommend  other  treatment 
regimens.

A later data cut-off (December 2018) set of data was provided as part of the response to the request from 
the Rapporteurs for more long-term treatment efficacy data. This data set included at baseline 
approximately 300 patients, and 104 patients at week 52. The results as measured by various 
investigator-assessed measures provided with the additional data confirm a beneficial efficacy of dupilumab 
in the adolescent target population.   
In summary, efficacy results in the total study population included in OLE study R668-AD-1434 showed 
improvements of AD symptoms based on the proportion of patients who achieved the co-primary endpoints 
as well as key secondary endpoints which is supported by long-term study data on key efficacy parameters 
of 299 patients; thus, a consistent positive efficacy is evidenced. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A total of 205 adolescent patients were exposed to dupilumab in the parent studies R668-AD-1526 or 
R668-AD-1412 and 299 patients during the OLE study R668-AD-1434 (and 104 patients having reached 
week 52 – data provided during the procedure).  
The applicant has demonstrated clinical efficacy of dupilumab administered as 300 mg Q4W, 200/300mg 
Q2W or weight-based dose regimen of 2 and 4 mg/kg/bw/QW, respectively, as monotherapy or in 
combination with TCS in patients who suffer from moderate-to-severe AD and are insufficiently controlled on 
topical therapies for AD. 
The superiority to placebo is demonstrated for these three dupilumab doses, and especially the results from 
the studies R668-AD-1526 show a significant higher and clinically meaningful improvement in severity of AD 
in the dupilumab 300 mg Q4W and 200/300 mg Q2W groups compared to placebo, whereby the Q2W 
regimen yields better results regarding the analysed treatment effects. Also significant efficacy was 
demonstrated in the key secondary endpoints such as pruritus, SCORAD, Change in ACQ-5, GISS, POEM, 
HADS and CDLQI. The effects demonstrated are considered to be clinically relevant. 
The therapeutic effects were seen as early as 2 weeks with a near maximal effect demonstrated at 12 to 16 
weeks. In summary, efficacy results of OLE study R668-AD-1434 showed improvements of AD symptoms 
based on the proportion of patients who achieved the co-primary endpoints as well as key secondary 
endpoints which is substantiated by long-term efficacy data with 109 and 28 patients with an overall 
treatment exposure of ≥52 ≥104 weeks, respectively. 
OLE study R668-AD-1434 recruited patients from studies R668-AD-1526, R668-AD-1607 and 
R668-AD-1412. Included patients were treated with 2 mg/kg QW or 4 mg/kg QW, the dose was 
subsequently amended to a fixed dose of 300 mg Q4W with the possibility of up-titration to 200/300 mg 
Q2W dependent on the bodyweight in case of inadequate clinical response at week 16.Concomitant topical 
medication was allowed. Efficacy assessments included EASI, IGA of AD severity, pruritus NRS, SCORAD, 
BSA involvement with AD, POEM, CDLQI, assessment of AD flares, and maintenance of treatment effect.  
The presented efficacy results in the dossier are based and focused on patients stemming from parent study 
R668-AD-1412 (n=36) which received a stable weight-based dose regimen over 22 months on average. 
According to the MAH this approach was chosen to minimize bias caused by administration of different dose 
regimens (intra- and inter-patient dosing) during the other parent studies R668-AD-1526 and 
R668-AD-1607.  
34 of the included 275 patients had completed 52 treatment weeks. Thereof 41.2% (14/34) reached the 
co-primary endpoint by achieving IGA 0 or 1; the proportion of patients with EASI-75 relative to baseline of 
the previous study was 82.4% (28/34). The majority (76%) applied concomitant topical TCS/TCI.The 
proportions reaching the co-primary endpoints were higher after week 16 than during the pivotal study 
R668-AD-1526 but these results might be influenced by residual dupilumab concentrations resulting from 
the treatments obtained during the parent studies (54% (149/275) had a treatment gap of 6-13 weeks

before entering the OLE study); it remains unclear however, how many patients had shorter treatment 
interruptions.  
Efficacy results in the subgroup of patients who rolled over from R668-AD-1412 were exactly the same as in 
the OLE study whereby more patients used TCS/TCI (97.2%).  
The proportion of patients that needed up-titration of dupilumab from the previous Q4W regimen to the 
weight-based Q2W regimen (36.2% until week 16) reflects higher dupilumab concentrations were needed to 
control disease activity in this AD patient population. patients  This is addressed by a weight based posology  
The patients enrolled from study 1412 which was a weight-based regimen, appear to achieve increasingly 
improved results over time for IGA 0/1, EASI 75 and 90, as well as pruritus NRS reduction ≥4.  Improvement 
from baseline is expected as these patients had a treatment interruption of at least 8 weeks between the last 
dose in the R668-AD-1412 and the baseline of the OLE.  Although the numbers of patients are decreasing 
over time, consistent or improved results are seen between weeks 52 to 104.  
In summary, efficacy results in the total study population included in OLE study R668-AD-1434 showed 
improvements in AD symptoms based on the proportion of patients who achieved the co-primary endpoints 
as well as key secondary endpoints. Long-term efficacy data was  limited to 34 patients completing week 52 
and merely 134 patients reached week 16  in the original dossier. Further data provided during the 
procedure (104 and 295 patients completing week 52 and week 16 respectively) confirmed the long term 
efficacy of dupilumab treatment and the above data is a mixture of patients who continued on treatment, 
those who taken off treatment and subsequently were retreated following relapse of control. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Dupilumab is administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection and, as with all biologics administered SC, 
would be expected to cause injection site reactions (ISRs) in some patients. 
Data on the incidence of ISRs were collected as part of the safety program and severe ISRs lasting longer 
than 24 hours were handled as adverse events of special interest (AESI) in the dupilumab program. In the 
clinical AD program, study exclusion criteria designed to protect patient safety were developed based on the 
above theoretical concerns and the occurrence of events related to these concerns were monitored during 
the clinical studies. 
The purpose of this Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) is to provide an analysis of safety data from all 
adolescent AD patients exposed to dupilumab at the time of database lock for the individual studies (see 
details below). The safety analysis of adolescent patients with AD described in this SCS is based primarily on 
the placebo-controlled phase 3 study (R668-AD-1526) and is supported by data from the completed phase 
2a pharmacokinetic (PK)/safety study (R668-AD-1412), the autoinjector device (AI) study 
(R668-AD-1607), and the pediatric open-label extension (OLE) (R668-AD-1434) (Figure 1). The numbers of 
patients treated in these studies are presented in Table 1. 
Studies R668-AD-1434, R668-AD-1412, and R668-AD-1607 allowed concomitant use of topical treatments 
(eg, TCS, TCI) during the studies; therefore, the safety data from these studies provide support for 
dupilumab to be used with or without topical treatment.

a The number of patients randomized and included in the full analysis set (FAS) was 251; 1 patient

d Data from study R668-AD-1607 Part B (300 mg PFP portion, not complete as of data cutoff for this 
application) are not discussed in this application, however, the 27 adolescents from Part B who entered the 
OLE study R668-AD-1434 are included in the OLE analysis dataset (not complete as of data cutoff for this 
application). 
Overview of Safety Assessments and Analyses 
The data from the 4 clinical studies that comprise the dupilumab program for adolescents with 
moderate-to-severe AD have not been pooled given the significant differences across these studies. 
Instead, the SCS is based predominantly on safety data derived from the double-blind, placebo controlled 
study R668-AD-1526 and is supported by data from the open-label studies R668-AD-1412, R668-AD-1434, 
and R668-AD-1607.  
The dupilumab dosing regimens varied between studies and only a subset of adolescents received the 
proposed authorisation dose e.g. 82 in R668-AD-1526 (16 weeks study) and 141 in a long term extension 
study after up-titration from 300mg Q4W dose. 
The general safety data have not been pooled which is agreed due to the divergent study conditions 
(design/dose/duration of treatment etc.). The approach of a primary analysis of the pivotal phase 3 study 
R668-AD-1526 supported by data from the three studies R668-AD-1412, R668-AD-1434, and 
R668-AD-1607 is endorsed. Only the supportive studies allowed concomitant use of topical treatments (eg, 
TCS, TCI). All analyses are focused on the adolescent study population (≥12 to <18 years of age with 
moderate-to-severe AD whose disease could not be adequately controlled with topical medications or for 
whom topical treatment was medically inadvisable). The subgroup analyses are agreed.

R668-AD-1434. 
[2] Treatment duration is calculated as sum of treatment duration to dupilumab for each dose regimen in 
each individual study. 
[3] Patients received at least 1 dupilumab dose in 1 of the studies were included in this column and counted 
only once.  The duration of treatment exposure to dupilumab dose for a patient who entered study 
R668-AD-1434 was calculated as the sum of duration of treatment exposure to dupilumab in the previous 
study plus duration of treatment exposure to dupilumab in the OLE study.  The 322 patients include all 
patients who received at least 1 dose of dupilumab in either the parent study or the OLE study:  234 patients 
from R668-AD-1526 (16 patients in the placebo group did not rollover to the OLE study), 43 patients from 
R668-AD-1412 (40 adolescent patients and 3 patients who turned 12 years of age at the time rolling over to 
the OLE study), 18 adolescent patients from Part A of R668-AD-1607 and 27 adolescent patients from Part 
B of R668-AD-1607.   
[4] These are 34 patients from parent study R668-AD-1412 and 1 patient from parent study R668-AD-1526 
who all rolled over in OLE study R668-AD-1434.

Adverse events 
Overview of Adverse Events 
Study R668-AD-1526 
The proportion of patients reporting TEAEs was similar during the 16-week treatment period between the 
placebo group and the combined dupilumab treatment groups. Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in 
intensity and deemed not related to study drug by the investigator (Table 35). 
There was a higher proportion of patients with treatment-related TEAEs in the dupilumab Q2W group 
(22.0%) compared to the dupilumab Q4W group (14.5%) and the placebo group (15.3%). There were no 
SAEs reported in either dupilumab treatment group and no deaths reported in the study.

[1] There were 2 patients in the dupilumab Q2W arm who discontinued treatment during the study period 
due to AEs unrelated to dupilumab.  These patients re-initiated study drug during the OLE study 
R668-AD-1434.  These 2 patients are not counted under AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug 
permanently. 
Note:  At each level of patient summarization,  a patient is counted once if the patient reported 1 or more 
events. 
Abbreviations:  Q2W, every 2 weeks; Q4W, every 4 weeks; SAE, serious adverse event; SAF, safety

Study R668-AD-1434 
Open-label extension study R668-AD-1434 included safety data from a heterogeneous population with 
respect to dosing and dupilumab exposure, ranging from 300 mg Q4W to 4 mg/kg QW (resulting in mean 
drug levels comparable to 300 mg QW). Adverse event data for this study were summarized for the total 
patient population as of the data cutoff date for the submission (n=275) and for the population of patients 
that rolled over from parent study R668-AD-1412 (n=36, of which 34 patients had ≥52 weeks of treatment 
with dupilumab). 
In the OLE study (n=275), approximately half of the patients experienced at least 1 TEAE. Most of the events 
were mild to moderate in intensity and deemed unrelated to the study drug by the investigator. There were 
4 patients who experienced an SAE during the study. There were no AEs that led to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug and no deaths reported during the study. There were further data provided 
with a later data cut-off (December 2018) during the procedure (n=299, enrolled with 109 and 21 patients 
with an overall treatment exposure of ≥52 ≥104 weeks respectively). 
For those patients who rolled over into the OLE from R668-AD-1412 and received weight-based dosing 
(n=36, of which 34 patients had ≥52 weeks of treatment with dupilumab), a total of 97.2% (35/36) of 
patients experienced a TEAE, of which 27.8% (10/36) had a dupilumab-related TEAE. Most TEAEs were mild 
or moderate in severity, with 11.1% (4/36) of patients experiencing a severe TEAE. A total of 8.3% (3/36) 
experienced SAEs; however, none of the SAEs was considered to be related to study drug. No TEAEs led to 
study drug discontinuation.

Study R668-AD-1412 
In study R668-AD-1412 (n = 40), the number of adolescent patients experiencing at least 1 TEAE was higher 
in the 4 mg/kg dose cohort (80% [16/20]) than in the 2 mg/kg cohort (55.0% [11/20]), which was driven 
primarily by Nasopharyngitis. Two patients in the 4 mg/kg cohort each reported 1 severe (non serious) TEAE 
of Dermatitis Atopic. Two adolescents experienced SAEs in the study: 1 patient in the 4 mg/kg cohort had 
SAEs of Dermatitis Infected and Staphylococcal Skin Infection, and 1 patient in the 2 mg/kg cohort 
experienced Palpitations and an additional SAE of Dermatitis Infected. There were no deaths or TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation of study drug. 
Study R668-AD-1607 Part A 
Among adolescent patients, 61.1% (11/18) of patients experienced TEAEs, with only 16.7% (3/18) of 
patients experiencing TEAEs considered related to study drug. There were no SAEs, severe TEAEs, or TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation of study drug among adolescent patients in Part A of study R668-AD-1607. 
Treatment-Emergent Treatment-Related Adverse Events Study R668-AD-1526 
The proportion of patients who had at least 1 treatment-related TEAE (relatedness assessed by the 
investigator) during the 16-week treatment period was higher for patients in the dupilumab Q2W treatment 
group than for patients in the placebo group or the dupilumab Q4W treatment group (Table 36). This was 
primarily driven by a higher incidence of ISRs in the dupilumab Q2W group compared to the other 2 groups. 
The incidence of Conjunctivitis was also higher in the dupilumab Q2W group as compared to the placebo 
group. Safety findings of treatment-related TEAEs during the entire study period (approximately 
28 weeks) were similar to the 16-week treatment period.

Study R668-AD-1434 
In the OLE study R668-AD-1434, 9.5% (26/275) of patients in the adolescent age group experienced a TEAE 
considered related to treatment by the investigator. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs 
fell under the SOC General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (3.3% [9/275] of patients) and 
included ISRs. Injection Site Mass and Injection Site Edema were each reported by 3 patients (1.1%), and 
Injection Site Erythema and Injection Site Swelling were each reported by 2 patients (0.7%). Other 
treatment-related TEAEs reported in 2 or more patients included the PTs of Nasopharyngitis, Oral Herpes, 
Dermatitis Atopic, Conjunctivitis Allergic, Dry Eye, and Oropharyngeal Pain (all reported by 2 patients each). 
Additional data from R668-AD-1434 using a later data cut-off date (December 2018) were provided upon 
request of the agency. NO new safety concerns in adolescents with atopic dermatitis were identified. 
Study R668-AD-1412 
In study R668-AD-1412, 12.5% (5/40) of patients in the adolescent age group experienced a TEAE 
considered related to treatment by the investigator. Treatment-related TEAEs occurred at a higher 
frequency in the 4 mg/kg dose cohort than in the 2 mg/kg dose cohort (20.0% [4/20] and 5.0% [1/20], 
respectively). No treatment-related TEAE was reported by >1 adolescent patient; no trends in SOC or PT 
were observed. 
Study R668-AD-1607 Part A 
In study R668-AD-1607, 16.5% (14/85) of patients experienced a TEAE considered related to treatment by 
the investigator. Treatment-related TEAEs occurred at a similar frequency in the AI group and the PFS group 
(14.3% [6/42] and 18.6% [8/43], respectively). The only events that were reported by ≥2 patients in any 
treatment group were Injection Site Pruritus (1 patient in the AI group and 2 patients in the PFS group) and 
Conjunctivitis (no patients in the AI group and 2 patients in the PFS group). All other treatment-related 
TEAEs were reported by ≤1 patient in any treatment group, and none of them were reported in both groups. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events 
Treatment-emergent SAEs are summarized for each study below. More detailed descriptions of 
treatment-emergent SAEs are provided in the patient narratives included with each individual CSR. 
Study R668-AD-1526 
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, no patients in the dupilumab treatment groups experienced 
SAEs. One patient in the placebo treatment group experienced the SAE of Appendicitis.  
Study R668-AD-1434 
In the OLE study, 4 patients experienced SAEs, including Injection Site Cellulitis, Ankle Fracture, 
Patent Ductus Arteriosus, and Food Allergy (each reported by 1 patient). None of these events were 
considered related to study drug or led to discontinuation of study drug. However, the event of Injection Site 
Cellulitis was considered by the investigator to be related to the study procedure. Of the 4 patients that 
experienced SAEs, 3 of the patients were those who rolled over into the OLE from R668-AD-1412 and 
received weight-based dosing. 
Study R668-AD-1412 
Two adolescent patients (1 in each treatment group) in this open-label study experienced SAEs. 
One patient in the 2 mg/kg treatment group experienced SAEs of Dermatitis Infected and Palpitations, and 
1 patient in the 4 mg/kg treatment group experienced SAEs of Dermatitis Infected and Staphylococcal Skin 
Infection. The event of Staphylococcal Skin Infection occurred 7 weeks after the patient’s final dose of study 
treatment and was considered not related to study drug. None of these events were considered related to 
study drug.

Study R668-AD-1607 Part A 
In this open-label study, treatment-emergent SAEs were experienced by 1 patient in the AI group 
(Lymphadenopathy) and 1 patient in the PFS group (Sepsis) (both patients were >18 years old). 
Deaths 
There were no deaths in the adolescent AD program. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation and AESIs are summarized for each study below.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Treatment-emergent AESIs were defined for each study. 
Study R668-AD-1526 
Treatment-emergent AESIs were experienced by 2 patients in the Q2W dupilumab group (Suicidal Ideation 
and Food Allergy [1 event each]) and 1 patient in the Q4W dupilumab group (Keratitis). 
Study R668-AD-1434 
Treatment-emergent AESIs were experienced by 3 patients in the adolescent group. One patient 
experienced a non-serious AESI of Conjunctivitis Allergic (which was severe in intensity and hence classified 
as an AESI), 1 patient experienced a non serious AESI of Depression (which was associated with suicidal 
ideation and hence classified as an AESI), and 1 patient experienced an SAE of Food Allergy. 
Study R668-AD-1412 
Treatment-emergent AESIs were experienced by 3 patients in the adolescent group. One patient (4 mg/kg 
group) experienced a non serious AESI of Allergic Edema(localized edema reported as “swelling hand”) and 
2 patients (1 in each treatment group) experienced the serious AESI of Dermatitis Infected. 
Study R668-AD-1607 Part A 
Treatment-emergent AESIs were experienced by 3 patients in each group in study R688-AD-1607, which 
included Urticaria, Conjunctivitis Allergic, Conjunctivitis, Vulvovaginal Mycotic Infection,  Sepsis, and 
Hypersensitivity (1 patient each). None of the AESIs were reported by more than 1 patient in either group. 
The AESI of Sepsis led to discontinuation of study drug. Of note, the events of Conjunctivitis Allergic and 
Conjunctivitis were non serious TEAEs, but they both occurred for >28 days, which qualified them as AESIs 
in this study. The events of Conjunctivitis Allergic and Conjunctivitis occurred in patients <18 years old. All 
other AESIs in this study were reported in patients >18 years old. 
The summary of TEAEs reported by more than 2% of patients is described below in table 37.

Study R668-AD-1434 
In the OLE study R668-AD-1434, TEAEs occurred in 149/275 (54.2%) patients during the study with an EAIR 
of  283.051  patients  per  100  patient-years  (nP/100 PY).    The  most  common  TEAEs  by  PT  (≥5%  in  all 
patients)  included  Nasopharyngitis,  Upper  Respiratory  Tract  Infection,  Dermatitis  Atopic  (typically 
worsening or exacerbation), and Headache.  Of note, Allergic Conjunctivitis occurred in 2.2% of patients, 
and Conjunctivitis (unspecified etiology) occurred in 1.8% of patients  All other PTs were reported in <5% of 
patients. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
No meaningful changes from baseline were observed regarding RBC or WBC. The transient increase in 
eosinophil counts during the first weeks of treatment is a known phenomenon caused by dupilumab 
treatment and was extensively discussed during the MAAs for dupilumab in the adult AD and 
adult/adolescent asthma population. Accordant and appropriate measures were implemented in the RMP 
and SmPC to avert possible risks in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions. Neither clinically meaningful 
deviations of clinical chemistry parameters were observed nor electrolyte abnormalities. No harmful impact 
on the renal or liver function was detected. 
Instrumental tests

ECG abnormalities were present during study R668-AD-1434 as 30.6% (11/36) of all patients had at least 1 
treatment-emergent PCSV for ECGs mainly with increase of 30-60 ms from baseline in QTc interval (16.7%). 
None of these PCSVs were reported as a TEAE or led to treatment discontinuation. The QTc PCSVs were not 
associated with other significant ECG abnormalities or clinical signs and did not  
lead to additional investigations.

There was a trend towards increased immunogenicity in adolescents as compared to adults. 
In all the studies of dupilumab in AD adults’ patients, submitted in the original application, which included 
studies conducted in patients treated with dupilumab for over 52 weeks, the proportion of patients with 
treatment-emergent positive response in the ADA assay was ≤10%.  
On the other hand, a positive ADA response was observed in 18.4% of adolescents treated with dupilumab 
in study R668-AD-1526 (16 weeks’ duration), in 50 patients (64.9%) in R668-AD-1412 study and in 19.9% 
of adolescents in the long term extension study (including 109 patients with 52 weeks treatment duration). 
In studies in adults only 2 % showed persistent titers whereas in the studies in adolescents the persistent 
ADA response was reported in 2.5 % in R668-AD-1526 study and in 6% in the long term extension study. 
There were no adolescents with boosted ADA response.

It is noted that a particularly high ADA response was observed in R668-AD-1412 study. As discussed a 
positive AD response was reported in up to 50 patients (64.9%) children, 31 of which (40.3% of total 77 
patients) were categorized as having a persistent, treatment-emergent ADA response.  
In patients with high titer the serum concentration decreased during the initial period; however, with 
continued treatment over time, ADA titer values declined (some to negative ADA status) with corresponding 
increase in dupilumab concentrations to a typical steady-state value.  
It is noted that a total of 1/3 patient with moderate titer ADA response had TEAEs under Injection Site 
Reaction (HLT), which were events of Injection Site Pain and Injection Site Swelling. A total of 2/3 patients 
with high titer ADA response had TEAEs under Injection Site Reaction (HLT), which were events of Injection 
Site Edema and Injection Site Hemorrhage. 
In in Study R668-AD-1526, the proportion of patients reporting at least 1 TEAE was similar in the 
ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients in both the dupilumab Q4W (11/17 [64.7%]) in ADA positive vs 
43/65 [66.2%] in ADA negative) and dupilumab Q2W group (9/13 [(69.2%]) in ADA positive vs 50/68 
[73.5%] in ADA negative). 
The incidence of commonly reported AEs like Dermatitis Atopic (exacerbation thereof) and Injection Site 
Reactions was comparable between ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients in both the dupilumab 
treatment groups. 
A total of 8/136 (5.9%) patients had a persistently positive ADA response during the study. Of these, 7/8 
(87.5%) had at least 1 TEAE during the study. In comparison, 18/21 (85.7%) patients with a transient 
response and 7/7 (100%) patients with an indeterminate response had at least 1 TEAE during the study. 
Due to a small number of patients with persistent titer it is difficult to conclude if there were any differences 
in the types of TEAEs reported in this population as compared to patients without ADA response.  
There were no reports of anaphylactic reaction (using narrow search terms under SMQ anaphylactic 
reaction) during the study and systemic hypersensitivity was only reported in the context of food allergy. 
Safety in special subgroups 
Analyses of designated subgroup populations were planned in study R668-AD-1526 only. Subgroups to be 
considered for comparing safety data included age, gender, ethnicity, race, duration of AD, baseline weight 
group, and baseline BMI group. There was an inadequate number of patients for meaningful conclusions to 
be drawn for the subgroups of Hispanic or Latino patients (n=13 to 20 patients per treatment group). In 
general,  the  subgroup  sample  sizes  were  small  and  limited  the  ability  to  draw  definite  conclusions  from 
comparative subgroup analyses. 
A trend towards higher incidence of TEAEs in the dupilumab Q2W group was observed in patients ≥12 to <15 
years of age (79.1%) as compared to patients ≥15 to <18 years of age (64.1%).  
This difference across the 2 age subgroups was not observed in the dupilumab Q4W group. Similarly, the 
incidence of TEAEs with the dupilumab Q2W group was higher in patients <60 kg (81.4%) as compared to 
patients  ≥60  kg  (61.5%).  This  difference  across  the  2  weight  subgroups  was  also  not  observed  in  the 
dupilumab Q4W group. These differences were driven by a higher incidence of Dermatitis Atopic, ISRs, and 
Headache in the patients ≥12 to <15 years old and in patients <60 kg. 
The incidences of treatment-emergent severe AEs, treatment-related AEs, SAEs, treatment-related SAEs, 
and  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  dose  withdrawal  was  low  for  all  patients  in  the  study.  Therefore,  no 
conclusions could be drawn from subgroup analyses of these factors. 
Safety When Used with Concomitant TCS and TCI 
Dupilumab was well tolerated, where a majority of patients used concomitant topical medications (TCS and 
TCI). The safety profile was comparable with that in the monotherapy pivotal study R668-AD-1526,  the data 
support the use of dupilumab with or without topical treatment.

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
There were no pregnancies reported in studies R668-AD-1526, R668-AD-1434, R668-AD-1412, and 
R668-AD-1607. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
The effect of dupilumab withdrawal was evaluated in the context of disease recurrence following treatment 
discontinuation. During the 8-week follow-up period of study R668-AD-1412 (weeks 12 to 20) at the end of 
the 4-week repeat-dosing treatment period, there was a return of AD symptomatology, trending toward but 
not reaching baseline. These observations indicate that continuous treatment is necessary to achieve and 
sustain the clinical benefit of dupilumab.  No rebound effect (worsening of disease above baseline) after 
treatment withdrawal was observed in the studies. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new data applicable to this submission. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Only two patients of the pivotal study had a treatment interruption; one case of permanent treatment 
discontinuation was recorded in the placebo group. 
Post marketing experience 
Dupilumab is not currently approved in patients <18 years of age. However, a cumulative search 
with data lock point (DLP) date of 21 Apr 2018 was performed in the Sanofi safety database to identify all 
post-marketed cases of dupilumab use in patients <18 years of age. 
There were 156 post-marketed cases reported for DUPIXENT cumulatively up to the DLP of 21 Apr 2018 in 
patients less than 18 years of age. Of these, only 2 cases were serious, and no fatal cases were reported. 
One patient experienced the serious event coded as “Unevaluable Event”, which was reported as “symptoms 
have been worsening”. No additional details were provided. 
One patient experienced the serious event of Loss of Consciousness, which was reported to have occurred 
for approximately 5 seconds after the patient’s first dose of dupilumab and was diagnosed by the patient’s 
physician as vasovagal response. Review of the post-marketed cases identified no new safety concerns. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
General 
The proposed authorisation dose for adolescents with body weight less than 60 kg is 400 mg as the initial 
dose followed by 200 mg given every other week whereas for adolescents with body weight  60 kg  and more 
the initial dose 600 mg followed by 300 mg given every other week. 
The general safety data have not been pooled which is agreed due to the divergent study conditions 
(design/dose/duration of treatment etc.). The approach of a primary analysis of the pivotal phase 3 study 
R668-AD-1526 supported by data from the three studies R668-AD-1412, R668-AD-1434, and 
R668-AD-1607 is acceptable.  
All  analyses  are  focused  on  the  adolescent  study  population  (≥12  to  <18  years  of  age  with 
moderate-to-severe AD whose disease could not be adequately controlled with topical medications or for 
whom topical treatment was medically inadvisable). The performed subgroup analyses are generally agreed 
but the results are considered inconclusive due to the small sample sizes.

Exposure 
In total 322 adolescents were exposed to dupilumab (in studies in atopic dermatitis) for the mean duration 
of exposure of 32 weeks. 109 adolescents received treatment with dupilumab for 52 weeks and 28 subjects 
received treatment for more than 104 weeks.  
The pooled safety data of the 4 studies included in this submission show that 322 patients had received at 
least 1 dose of dupilumab. The majority (76.4%) had completed at least 16 weeks of treatment (10.9% at 
least 52 weeks of treatment, 8.4% at least 104 weeks of treatment) with a mean number of 32 treatment 
weeks and 19 administered doses.  
However, only 50% (~240 patients) of the fixed dose groups (300 mg Q4W and 200/300 mg Q2W) were 
treated over a period of 16 weeks and 82-86% of the 43 patients of the weight-based 2 and 4 mg/kg, 
respectively, have reached treatment duration of 16 weeks. 
The number of administered doses was the highest in the weight-based dose group (38% vs. 27% having 
received >100 cumulative doses in the 2 mg or 4 mg/kg bw). The lowest exposure was recorded in the 300 
mg Q4W group (8.8% (25/284) patients received >12 doses), the 200 and 300 mg Q2W dose groups had a 
slightly higher exposure of 10% having received >16 cumulative doses. As the mean and median number of 
study drug administrations and median treatment duration were similar between the placebo and treatment 
groups the comparative safety profile is complete. 
The applicant provided further paediatric long-term safety data derived from the OLE study using a data 
cut-off of Dec 2018. While long-term treatment with dupilumab is still evolving it is not associated with any 
new safety concerns in adolescents with atopic dermatitis and it continues to be well tolerated. Additional 
longer-term safety data will continue to be monitored. 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) 
R668-AD-1526 
Any TEAE in SOCs Infections and Infestations occurred in comparable frequency in the treatment groups and 
in the placebo group e.g in 38 (45.8%) in the Q4W group, in 34 (41.5%) in the Q2W group and in 37 
(43.5%) in the placebo group. It is noted that these frequencies are higher as compared to those reported 
in 16 weeks’ studies in adults. 
A higher incidence of treatment-related TEAEs was recorded in the 200/300 mg Q2W group of the pivotal 
study R668-AD-1526 compared to the 300 mg Q4W group (22% vs. 14.5% vs 15.3% in the placebo group).  
Most treatment-related TEAEs were recorded in the infections and infestations SOC: 8.5% vs. 7.2% vs. 
4.7% in the 200/300 mg Q2W, 300 mgQ4W and placebo arms respectively and conjunctivitis was the most 
common PT (3.7% vs. 1.2% vs. 0%) followed by upper respiratory tract infections (2.4% vs. 0% vs. 2.4%). 
However, conjunctivitis was a rare clinical symptom and based on the hitherto collected data it is assumed 
that this phenomenon is also linked to the underlying disease AD itself. In R668-AD-1526 study there was a 
higher proportion of patients with any TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs in the dupilumab Q2W group 
compared to the Q4W group (as discussed the drug concentration was higher in the Q2W group as compared 
to the Q4W group). 
The difference between these two treatment groups was mostly seen for Injection site reactions and 
Conjunctivitis. Treatment related events in the General disorders SOC were reported in 9.8% of subjects in 
the dupilumab Q2W group and only in 3.6 % of subjects in Q4W (these were mainly injection site reactions). 
An additional clear analysis of the relationship of the administered dose (200 or 300 mg dose Q2W) and 
observed TEAEs during the pivotal phase 3 study was provided by the MAH upon request.  
Regarding the overall TEAE incidences of, the lower dose group (200 mg Q2W) had more TEAE (81.4% vs. 
61.5% and 63.9%, respectively) and drug-related TEAE (25.6% vs. 17.9% and 14.5%, respectively) than 
the other dose groups (300 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q4W).  
The SOCs of "Infections and Infestations" and "General disorders and administration site conditions had 
slightly higher incidences not driven by any particular PT. "The SOCs of "Skin and subcutaneous tissue

disorders", "Nervous system disorders" and "Eye disorders" had a higher incidence in the lower dose group 
(200 mg Q2W vs. 300 mg Q2W) driven by PTs of Dermatitis atopic, Headache and Conjunctivitis allergic.  
Noticeable were higher incidences of headache (16.3% vs. 5.1%), atopic dermatitis (23.3% vs. 12.8%) and 
conjunctivitis allergic (7.0% vs. 0%). However, no SAEs or TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were 
observed and the TEAEs were almost exclusively mild to moderate. As conjunctivitis allergic, headache and 
injection site reactions are already listed as ADRs in the SmPC, it can be concluded that no new safety issues 
became apparent after these separate analyses of the different dose regimens. 
With regards to the safety profile of the Q2W dosing schedule as compared to Q4W, minor differences were 
noted between the frequencies of occurrence of some PTs between the Q4W and Q2W group, overall the 
rates were comparable. However, it must be remembered that the number of events is rather low.  
Increasing frequency of administration will cause an increased incidence of injection site reactions/AE’s, 
however the Q2W regimen is expected to be less immunogenic that Q4W.  
It is also agreed that the Q2W dose group was numerically superior to the Q4W dose group on most 
primary/key secondary categorical endpoints (IGA 0 or 1, NRS reduction of ≥3 points from baseline, NRS 
reduction of ≥4 from baseline), while it was numerically higher the difference is not clinically relevant 
between the dose regimens.  
Moreover, the frequency of TEAE’s and SAE’s were similar between those aged 12-15 yrs compared to 
patients aged 15-18 years. For weight cut off < 60 kgs SAES were higher and occurred at a frequency of 
2.7% compared to only 0.7% in those > 60 kgs.  
A case of herpes simplex was the only new SAE in the updated data from this study using the new cut-off 
date and occurred in a patient who had been in close contact with an individual with herpes labialis prior to 
emergence of symptoms. The case was categorized as not related to dupilumab treatment by the 
investigator. 
There was no consistent dose trend or an increasing TEAE incidence with increasing dose. In fact, all of SOCs 
have a lower incidence in the highest dose group of 300 mg Q2W than 200 mg Q2W and some show a similar 
incidence between 200 mg Q2W and placebo a higher rate of overall TEAEs in the adolescents weighing <60 
kg who were dosed with 200 mg Q2W. This could be attributed to the low numbers of patients.  The higher 
overall TEAE incidence in this cohort (<60 kg cohort) however is being driven by multiple SOCs and appear 
to be driven by PTs of Dermatitis atopic, Headache and Conjunctivitis allergic respectively.  General 
administration and site disorders are also highest with 200mg Q2W regimen. None of these cases were 
reported as SAEs or TEAEs leading to discontinuation. 
Overall, it appears that patients weighing less than 60kgs have a higher incidence of adverse events 
compared with those weighing more than 60 kgs with comparable exposure.  However, the data is from a 
relatively small data set it may not be an accurate true estimate. 
R668-AD-1434 
Approximately 54% of the heterogenous population of OLE study R668-AD-1434 showed any TEAE, every 
tenth was deemed drug-related. A third of the patients who rolled over from the parent study R668-AD-1412 
experienced treatment-related TEAEs. The sponsor was asked to clarify if these were deemed to be related 
to a change to the fixed dose regime. The applicant derives the apparent higher frequency of related TEAEs 
recorded in patients stemming from parent study R668-AD-1412 and continuing in the paediatric open-label 
extension study R668-AD-1434 from a longer duration of exposure/observation. The provided rationale on 
the basis of exposure-adjusted comparison of incidence of related TEAEs is endorsed since no major 
differences were detected between patients who rolled over and those of the overall patient population.  
In R668-AD-1412  
TEAEs were reported in 80 % of patients in the 4mg/kg group as compared to 55% the 2mg/kg group. In this 
study in both arms the most common AEs reported after both single doses and repeated weekly doses were 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 136/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Nasopharyngitis and Atopic Dermatitis (exacerbation of AD).  The episodes of exacerbation of AD could have 
resulted from the study design in which patients had an 8-week treatment interruption between single-dose 
administration during Part A and start of Part B. 
Infections occurred twice as frequent in the 4mg/kg group as compared to the 2mg/kg group. The observed 
difference was driven primarily by Nasopharyngitis which was reported in 40 % of subjects in the 4 mg/kg 
arm as compared to 10 % of subjects in the 2mg/kg group.  
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
Serious adverse events were rare across the adolescent AD program. No patients in the dupilumab 
treatment groups of the pivotal study 1526 experienced SAEs. One of the recorded SAE (Injection Site 
Cellulitis) during the OLE study 1434 was deemed related to dupilumab. No deaths were recorded. Two 
AESIS were recorded (viral keratitis and conjunctivitis lasting ≥28 days) that were categorised by the 
investigator as related to dupilumab treatment.  
Two patients of study R668-AD-1412 experienced SAE of infected dermatitis. According to the applicant the 
two SAEs of ‘dermatitis infected’ reported in R668-AD-1412 were deemed not related to the study drug by 
the investigator since their onset occurred outside the treatment period with dupilumab. The provided 
rationale on the basis of the two narratives is accepted. 
Laboratory findings 
No relevant changes were detected between the placebo and dupilumab groups in hematology, chemistry, 
and urinary analysis parameters apart from eosinophil and LDH levels.  
No  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  were  observed  regarding  RBC  or  WBC.  The  transient  increase  in 
eosinophil  counts  during  the  first  weeks  of  treatment  is  a  known  phenomenon  caused  by  dupilumab 
treatment  and  was  extensively  discussed  during  the  MAAs  for  dupilumab  in  the  adult  AD  and 
adult/adolescent  asthma  population.  Appropriate  measures  were  implemented  in  the  RMP  and  SmPC  to 
avert possible risks in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions.  
Neither  clinically  meaningful  deviations  of  clinical  chemistry  parameters  were  observed  nor  electrolyte 
abnormalities. No harmful impact on the renal or liver function was detected.  
30.6% (11/36) of all patients had at least 1 treatment-emergent PCSV for ECGs mainly with increase of 
30-60 ms from baseline in QTc interval (16.7%). Neither significant ECG abnormalities (prolongation of QTc 
interval, maximum values did not exceed 500 ms) nor added or associated clinical conspicuities as syncopes 
or cardiac arrhythmias were detected. These provided data suggest that no negative impact of dupilumab on 
the cardiac function is to be expected. 
Immunogenicity 
There was a trend towards increased immunogenicity in adolescents as compared to adults. In all the studies 
of dupilumab in AD adults patients, submitted in the original application, which included studies conducted 
in patients treated with dupilumab for over 52 weeks, the proportion of patients with treatment-emergent 
positive response in the ADA assay was ≤10%.  
In the pivotal study R668-AD-1526 most ADA-positive dupilumab- treated patients were detected in the 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q4W dose group (20.5% and 20.7%, respectively). Thereof, 2.6% and 
2.4% were persistent. All active doses developed treatment-emergent ADAs whereof the majority had a 
transient ADA response and only 5 patients had a persistent one. No distinct AE pattern became obvious 
amongst  the  ADA-positive  and  ADA-negative  individuals.  No  cases  of  systemic  hypersensitivity  occurred 
during the studies in the ADA-positive population. In studies in adults only 2 % showed persistent titers 
whereas in the studies in adolescents the persistent ADA response was reported in 2.5 % in R668-AD-1526 
study and in 6% in the long term extension study. There were no adolescents with boosted ADA response. 
Based on the totality of the provided clinical data, the overall immunogenicity incidence and ADA profile in 
adults  and  adolescent  patients  is  considered  similar,  especially  for  the  most  clinically  relevant  ADA 
endpoints, namely incidence of persistent ADA, high ADA titers and NAb positivity. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 137/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
From  a  safety  perspective,  there  were  no  events  of  systemic  hypersensitivity  (i.e.,  serum  sickness  and 
anaphylaxis) that were related to study drug, and as such no further analysis stratifying by ADA status was 
performed. Regarding other TEAEs, the low N precluded any meaningful analysis on safety by ADA status. 
In  patients  with  high  titer  the  serum  concentration  decreased  during  the  initial  period  however  with 
continued  treatment  over  time,  ADA  titer  values  declined  (some  to  negative  ADA  status)  with  a 
corresponding increase in dupilumab concentrations to a typical steady-state value.  
It is noted that a total of 1/3 patients with moderate titer ADA response had TEAEs under Injection Site 
Reaction (HLT), which were events of Injection Site Pain and Injection Site Swelling. A total of 2/3 patients 
with high titer ADA response had TEAEs under Injection Site Reaction (HLT), which were events of Injection 
Site Edema and Injection Site Hemorrhage.  
It  is  agreed  that  the  ADA  titres  were  not  associated  with  any  specific  SOC,  occurred  relatively  low  and 
majority were non serious. 
In relation to the long term extension study, ADA positive subgroup reported a higher incidence of ISRs 
(7/58 [12.1%]) than the ADA negative subgroup (13/234 [5.6%]), with a numerically increasing incidence 
observed  with  increasing  ADA  titers  (low  titer  3/46  [6.5%];  moderate  titer  1/8  [12.5%];  high  titer  3/4 
[75%]). This is expected with subcutaneous injection of biologics. None of the ISRs led to permanent study 
drug discontinuation and all were non-serious except one serious case of Injection site oedema.  
Subgroup analyses 
No pregnancies were reported during all studies. No rebound effect was observed. 
Only two patients of the pivotal study had a treatment interruption; one case of permanent treatment 
discontinuation was recorded in the placebo group. 
A cumulative search regarding post-marketing experience in adolescent patients revealed an off-label use in 
156 paediatric patients whereof 2 had unspecified SAE. 
In summary, no new safety concerns arose from the adolescent population and the safety profile is 
considered similar to that observed in adults. No new identified risks are present which should be 
incorporated in the RMP. The known safety profile was confirmed by updated data derived from OLE study 
R668-AD-1434.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, dupilumab was well tolerated in the adolescent patient population across the 4 studies included in 
this submission, including the dose and method of administration proposed for licensing. No new safety 
concerns arose from the adolescent population and the data were consistent with the hitherto known safety 
profile of the adult AD population.  
Overall, the size of the safety database for dupilumab to support the indication in adolescent patients with 
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis is PIP-conform concerning the pivotal study. The need of long-term 
safety data  has been addressed.  The potential risk of malignancy is addressed in the RMP.  Treatment with 
dupilumab in the AD placebo-controlled studies and the open-label extension studies was generally well 
tolerated and exhibited a low immunogenic potential. 
Sufficient long-term safety data was submitted upon request that substantiate the favourable safety profile 
in the adolescent population.

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet  is 
updated in accordance. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The MAH will submit the results of a user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet that 
meets the criteria for readability as recommended during procedure EMEA/H/C/004390/X/004G use within 
the next two months as agreed previously with CHMP/EMA. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, duplilumab is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is characterized clinically by periodic flares of 
dry, red, itchy skin lesions and pathogenically by a defective skin barrier, recurrent infections, and both local 
and systemic type 2 immune responses (Ring, 2012) (Eichenfield, 2014) (Geoghegan, 2017). 
Atopic dermatitis is the most common childhood inflammatory skin disease, affecting over 20% of the 
children in many industrialized countries. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood 
(ISAAC) Phase Three estimated that 5% to 10% of adolescents in most European countries have AD (Sole, 
2010). The majority of the adolescents presenting with AD have disease onset early in life. Forty to 60% of 
the cases of childhood AD persist post-puberty into adolescence (Wuthrich, 1999). Onset in adolescence 
occurs in a small group (<10%) of the total cases of AD (Bieber, 2017). A significant proportion of 
adolescent patients suffer from either moderate (17%) or severe (10%) forms of the disease (Johansson, 
2015). 
There is a paucity of studies comparing adults and adolescents with respect to the cellular and molecular 
mechanisms of disease in AD, because mechanistic studies involving the collection of skin biopsies and other 
invasive procedures are generally not feasible or pose ethical challenges in children. 
Based on multiple other similarities, however, it has been postulated that the mechanisms are similar. The 
pathophysiology of AD is influenced by genetics and environmental factors and involves a complex interplay 
between antigens, skin barrier defects, and immune dysregulation, in which a polarized inflammatory 
response induced by the marked activation of the T-helper type 2 (Th2) cell axis plays a central role (Gittler, 
2012).  
Clinical presentation of AD in adolescents is similar to that in adults. Lesions typically occur in the flexural 
areas and facial involvement is common, especially the forehead and periorbital regions. The wrists, hands, 
ankles, feet, fingers, and toes are also often involved (Wasserbauer, 2009) (Rudikoof, 1998). The eruption 
is characterized by dry, scaling erythematous papules and plaques, and the formation of large lichenified 
plaques from lesional chronicity. Pruritus is the hallmark of AD in adolescents, as in adults. The cycle of 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 140/147 
 
 
 
 
  
  
itching and scratching exacerbates the cellular damage in skin lesions and facilitates secondary infections, 
which can be serious (Boguniewicz, 2018). 
Consistent with the observation that AD in children is dominated by Type 2 inflammation is the 
demonstration that adolescents with AD also have a higher prevalence of allergic comorbidities such as 
asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies (Silverberg, 2013).  
Atopic dermatitis can be disabling in adolescents due to intractable pruritus and disfiguring skin lesions. The 
disease can affect the overall quality of life (QOL), cause significant sleep loss, have a negative impact on 
educational development and social interactions, and at times, cause psychological problems, including 
major depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Halvorsen, 2014) (Slattery, 2011).  
A survey that assessed rates of depressive and anxiety disorders in a clinical sample of adolescents with AD 
found increased rates of anxiety as compared to community estimates (23% to 40% vs. 3% to 6%). The risk 
of suicidal ideation has been found to be higher in patient with AD as compared to controls. A cross sectional 
study showed that 15.5% of dolescent patients with eczema reported suicidal ideation as compared to 9% 
in general population (Halvorsen, 2014). 
In addition, serious skin infections are associated with AD in adolescents, as in adults. More than 90% of 
patients with AD have Staphylococcus aureus colonization on their skin compared with only 10% of healthy 
individuals (Ong, 2014) which is directly correlated with AD severity. 
In addition, adolescent patients with AD may experience episodes of eczema herpeticum, a potentially 
life-threatening disseminated herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) or, less commonly, HSV-2 infection 
(Boguniewicz, 2010).  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently Available Therapies for Atopic Dermatitis in Adolescent Patients  
In general, therapies recommended for the treatment of AD in adults are also used in adolescents, and the 
treatment guidelines for AD do not specify age ranges in the pediatric population.  
Currently available therapies have significant side effects, and various systemic immunosuppressive drugs 
are used off-label with little evidence to support their use. Similar to the adult population, topical treatment 
is the mainstay of management of mild-to-moderate AD in adolescents. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) of 
varying potency represent the cornerstone of topical treatment and some low potency TCS are approved in 
pediatric patients as young as infants.  
However, their long-term use or large body-surface application is limited by the risk of local side effects (eg, 
skin atrophy and telangiectasia) as well as systemic adverse reactions, including 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and Cushing syndrome (Hengge, 2006).  
Children are more prone to the development of systemic reactions to topically applied medication because of 
their higher ratio of total body surface area to body weight. Linear growth retardation and delayed weight 
gain have been reported in children receiving TCS.  Moreover, continuous use of TCS can be associated with 
development of tachyphylaxis.  
Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are also available for use in adolescents, mostly as second-line therapy. 
Use of these agents is typically limited to areas that are prone to skin atrophy from application of TCS, eg, 
face, genitals, and flexural areas.  
Systemic agents approved for the treatment of AD in adolescents include systemic corticosteroids for severe 
or incapacitating AD intractable to conventional treatments. Ciclosporin A is not approved for AD in pediatric 
patients but often used off label for severe AD when systemic therapy is required.  
In addition, other systemic immunosuppressive agents are also commonly used off label in treatment of 
severe forms of the disease, including methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil.

Unmet Medical Need in Adolescent Patients 
Moderate-to-severe AD is a serious, chronic, debilitating skin disease with substantial impact on day-to-day 
functioning and wellbeing of affected adolescent patients. It shares pathophysiological pathways with other 
atopic/allergic conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies, which are common 
comorbidities in patients with AD.  
The currently available treatments for AD in adolescent patients have important limitations including 
unsatisfactory effectiveness, limited data from randomized, controlled clinical trials to guide their use in 
clinical practice, and important risks and side effects. These limitations result in a large number of 
adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease cannot be safely controlled by available 
therapies. Therefore, there exists an unmet medical need for an effective treatment that has a favorable 
safety profile for long-term use for adolescent patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease not 
adequately controlled by topical prescription therapies. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development program of dupilumab in the treatment of adolescent AD comprises 4 clinical 
studies.  
R668-AD-1526 is the pivotal phase 3 monotherapy study in patients aged 12-18 years with 
moderate-to-severe AD not adequately controlled with currently available topical treatments.  
Supportive data are derived from a phase 2a, open-label pharmacokinetic (PK)/safety study 
(R668-AD-1412), an pediatric open-label extension study (R668-AD-1434) and an open-label autoinjector 
(AI) study (R668-AD-1607, note: data assessed as part of the extension of indication in asthma).  
Thus, relevant patient exposure includes 292 adolescent patients stemming from studies R668-AD-1526, 
R668-AD-1412 and R668-AD-1434. 
OLE study R668-AD-1434 recruited patients from studies R668-AD-1526, R668-AD-1607 and 
R668-AD-1412. Included patients were treated with 2 mg/kg QW or 4 mg/kg QW, the dose was 
subsequently amended to a fixed dose of 300 mg Q4W with the possibility of up-titration to 200/300 mg 
Q2W dependent on the bodyweight in case of inadequate clinical response at week 16.  
The clinical development program was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in adolescent 
patients with moderate-to-severe AD not adequately controlled with currently available topical treatments. 
The patient population comprised adolescents with AD, as defined by the American Academy of Dermatology 
Consensus Criteria (Eichenfield, 2004) (Eichenfield, 2014). These patients had moderate-to-severe AD 
lesions affecting a large portion of their body surface area (BSA). They experienced high levels of AD 
symptoms, including pruritus. Their disease could not be adequately controlled with topical prescription 
medications.  
This population included patients who had been, or would typically be, candidates for systemic AD therapies. 
Efficacy assessments included measurements of the extent and intensity of AD signs, severity of AD 
symptoms, impact of AD on QOL, and anxiety and depression scores. 
A total of 205 adolescent patients were exposed to dupilumab in the parent studies R668-AD-1526 or 
R668-AD-1412 and 299 patients during the OLE study R668-AD-1434.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The applicant has demonstrated clinical efficacy of dupilumab administered as 300 mg Q4W, 200/300mg 
Q2W or weight-based dose regimen of 2 and 4 mg/kg/bw/QW, respectively, as monotherapy or in 
combination with TCS in patients who suffer from moderate-to-severe AD and are insufficiently controlled on 
topical therapies for AD. 
The superiority to placebo is demonstrated for these three dupilumab doses, and especially the results from 
the studies R668-AD-1526 show a significant higher and clinically meaningful improvement in severity of AD 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 142/147 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
in the dupilumab 300 mg Q4W and 200/300 mg Q2W groups compared to placebo, whereby the Q2W 
regimen yields better results regarding the analysed treatment effects. Also significant efficacy was 
demonstrated in the key secondary endpoints such as pruritus, SCORAD, Change in ACQ-5, GISS, POEM, 
HADS and CDLQI. The effects demonstrated are considered to be clinically relevant. 
The therapeutic effects were seen as early as 2 weeks with a near maximal effect demonstrated at 12 to 16 
weeks. In summary, efficacy results of OLE study R668-AD-1434 showed improvements of AD symptoms 
based on the proportion of patients who achieved the co-primary endpoints as well as key secondary 
endpoints which is substantiated by long-term efficacy data with 109 and 28 patients with an overall 
treatment exposure of ≥52 ≥104 weeks, respectively. 
34 of the included 275 patients had completed 52 treatment weeks. Thereof 41.2% (14/34) reached the 
co-primary endpoint by achieving IGA 0 or 1; the proportion of patients with EASI-75 relative to baseline of 
the previous study was 82.4% (28/34). The majority (76%) applied concomitant topical TCS/TCI.The 
proportions reaching the co-primary endpoints were higher after week 16 than during the pivotal study 
R668-AD-1526 but these results might be influenced by residual dupilumab concentrations resulting from 
the treatments obtained during the parent studies (54% (149/275) had a treatment gap of 6-13 weeks 
before entering the OLE study); it is unclear however, how many patients had shorter treatment 
interruptions.  
Efficacy results in the subgroup of patients who rolled over from R668-AD-1412 were exactly the same as in 
the OLE study whereby more patients used TCS/TCI (97.2%).  
The proportion of patients that needed up-titration of dupilumab from the previous Q4W regimen to the 
weight-based Q2W regimen (36.2% until week 16) reflects higher dupilumab concentrations were needed to 
control disease activity in this AD patient population. 
The patients enrolled from study 1412 which was a weight-based regimen, appear to achieve increasingly 
improved results over time for IGA 0/1, EASI 75 and 90, as well as pruritus NRS reduction ≥4.  Improvement 
from baseline is expected as these patients had a treatment interruption of at least 8 weeks between the last 
dose in the R668-AD-1412 and the baseline of the OLE.  Although the numbers of patients are decreasing 
over time, consistent or improved results are seen between weeks 52 to 104.  
In summary, efficacy results in the total study population included in OLE study R668-AD-1434 showed 
improvements in AD symptoms based on the proportion of patients who achieved the co-primary endpoints 
as well as key secondary endpoints.. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
21% of the patients assigned to the dupilumab 200/300 mg dose group, which is the intended dose for the 
claimed indication, used rescue medication during the pivotal study R668-AD-1526 and approximately 15 % 
had used any rescue medication by treatment week 16.  
Long-term efficacy data is limited to 34 patients completing week 52 and merely 134 patients reached week 
16. The above data is a mixture of patients who continued on treatment, those who taken off treatment and 
subsequently were retreated following relapse of control. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A higher incidence of treatment-related TEAE was recorded in the 200/300 mg Q2W group of the pivotal 
study R668-AD-1526 compared to the 300 mg Q4W group (22% vs. 14.5% vs 15.3% in the placebo group). 
Most related TEAE were recorded in the infections and infestations SOC: 8.5% vs. 7.2% vs. 4.7% and 
conjunctivitis was the most common PT (3.7% vs. 1.2% vs. 0%) followed by upper respiratory tract 
infections (2.4% vs. 0% vs. 2.4%).  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/463030/2019 
Page 143/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
A higher incidence of ISRs (9.8% vs. 3.6% vs. 4.7%) was recorded in the dupilumab Q2W treatment group 
compared with the other 2 groups as already seen in the adult population.  
Approximately 54% of the heterogeneous population of OLE study R668-AD-1434 showed any TEAE, every 
tenth was deemed drug-related. A third of the patients who rolled over from the parent study R668-AD-1412 
experienced treatment-related TEAEs.  
In the long term extension study 54.2% of subjects reported any TEAEs whereas any drug-related TEAE was 
reported in 9.5% of subjects.  
In the pivotal study R668-AD-1526 most ADA-positive dupilumab- treated patients were detected in the 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q4W dose group (20.5% and 20.7%, respectively). Thereof, 2.6% and 
2.4% were persistent. During study R668-AD-1412, ADA response was observed in 29 patients (72.5%), 
50% of which were categorized as having a persistent, treatment-emergent response. The majority (23/29, 
79.3%) of the treatment-emergent positive responses in the ADA assay were categorized as low titer. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Conjunctivitis was a low incidenceclinical symptom and it is assumed that this symptom is related to AD as 
primary disease since this phenomenon was not observed in the asthma population. 
Based  on  the  weight-of-evidence  assessment  of  the  literature,  IL-4  and  IL-13  actions  via  the  IL-4Rα 
activation pathway are predominantly protumorigenic. Although there were no cases of malignancy reported 
in paediatric studies the risk for children could be potentially higher. Malignancy is listed as an important 
potential risk in the RMP. 
Based on the currently available data there was no significantly increased risk detectable for dupilumab 
regarding malignancy, all types of infections or systemic hypersensitivity reactions. However, the safety 
profile has to be refined over the next years with more data coming from the ongoing open label extension 
trials in AD and Asthma.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The applicant has clearly demonstrated the beneficial treatment effects of dupilumab 200/300 mg Q2W as a 
monotherapy or combined with TCS in patients with moderate-to-severe AD who are inadequately controlled 
on topical therapies. 
The maintenance data provided on longer term use to 52 weeks was statistically significantly in favour of 
dupilumab.  
The general and most relevant safety concerns of dupilumab identified during the AD program are related to 
infections, eye disorders (conjunctivitis and related conditions), injection site reactions, antidrug antibodies 
resulting in systemic hypersensitivity reactions, risk of malignancy, limited long term data in patients 
treated with the proposed biweekly dose of dupilumab as well as uncertainties about the impact of 
dupilumab on pregnancies and their outcomes. This will be monitored in the post approval setting as 
mentioned in the RMP. 
In terms of infections the overall rate was slightly higher in the dupilumab treated patients compared with 
the placebo group. These were generally mild to moderate and common viral infections prevailed. No 
increased risk for helminth or opportunistic infections was identified. Conjunctivitis was a rare clinical 
symptom and it is assumed that this symptom is related to AD as primary disease since this phenomenon 
was not observed in the asthma population. The long term effect of chronic conjunctivitis in these patients 
is unknown. Cases of conjunctivitis will continue to be further monitored in the post approval setting as 
described in the RMP. 
Dupilumab use was not associated with a higher risk of experiencing TEAEs of systemic hypersensitivity in 
the adolescent population. No cases of systemic hypersensitivity occurred during the studies in the 
ADA-positive population.  There was a higher rate of ISR events in the dupilumab 300mg Q2W treat 
population compared with the dupilumab 300mg Q4W group. None of the events were classified as severe or 
serious. Discontinuation rates due to ISRs were very low. Overall, ISRs seemed to be mild to moderate 
self-limiting reactions that were well tolerated by patients.  
No case of malignancy was present across treatment groups. However, there is insufficient long term 
exposure data to characterise the risk of developing malignancy particularly at the dose proposed. This issue 
has been discussed during the initial MA for AD and is part of the RMP and subject to investigation in the OLE 
studies. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the data provided on efficacy and safety, the CHMP is of the opinion that the favourable effects 
outweigh the unfavourable effects. The benefit-risk profile of dupilumab is considered positive in the 
paediatric adolescent (12 to 17 years) AD population.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None.

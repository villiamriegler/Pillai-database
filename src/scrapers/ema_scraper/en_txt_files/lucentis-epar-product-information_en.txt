CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Lucentis is indicated in adults for: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 
The treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) 
The treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) 
The treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion 
(branch RVO or central RVO) 
The treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) 
• 
Lucentis is indicated in preterm infants for: 
• 
The treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with zone I (stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+), zone II 
(stage 3+) or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior ROP) disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Lucentis must be administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections. 
Posology 
Adults 
The recommended dose for Lucentis in adults is 0.5 mg given as a single intravitreal injection. This 
corresponds to an injection volume of 0.05 ml. The interval between two doses injected into the same 
eye should be at least four weeks. 
Treatment in adults is initiated with one injection per month until maximum visual acuity is achieved 
and/or there are no signs of disease activity i.e. no change in visual acuity and in other signs and 
symptoms of the disease under continued treatment. In patients with wet AMD, DME, PDR and RVO, 
initially, three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thereafter, monitoring and treatment intervals should be determined by the physician and should be 
based on disease activity, as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters. 
If, in the physician’s opinion, visual and anatomic parameters indicate that the patient is not benefiting 
from continued treatment, Lucentis should be discontinued. 
Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging 
techniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography). 
If patients are being treated according to a treat-and-extend regimen, once maximum visual acuity is 
achieved and/or there are no signs of disease activity, the treatment intervals can be extended stepwise 
until signs of disease activity or visual impairment recur. The treatment interval should be extended by 
no more than two weeks at a time for wet AMD and may be extended by up to one month at a time for 
DME. For PDR and RVO, treatment intervals may also be gradually extended, however there are 
insufficient data to conclude on the length of these intervals. If disease activity recurs, the treatment 
interval should be shortened accordingly. 
The treatment of visual impairment due to CNV should be determined individually per patient based 
on disease activity. Some patients may only need one injection during the first 12 months; others may 
need more frequent treatment, including a monthly injection. For CNV secondary to pathologic 
myopia (PM), many patients may only need one or two injections during the first year (see 
section 5.1). 
Lucentis and laser photocoagulation in DME and in macular oedema secondary to BRVO 
There is some experience of Lucentis administered concomitantly with laser photocoagulation (see 
section 5.1). When given on the same day, Lucentis should be administered at least 30 minutes after 
laser photocoagulation. Lucentis can be administered in patients who have received previous laser 
photocoagulation. 
Lucentis and verteporfin photodynamic therapy in CNV secondary to PM 
There is no experience of concomitant administration of Lucentis and verteporfin. 
Preterm infants 
The recommended dose for Lucentis in preterm infants is 0.2 mg given as an intravitreal injection. 
This corresponds to an injection volume of 0.02 ml. In preterm infants treatment of ROP is initiated 
with a single injection per eye and may be given bilaterally on the same day. In total, up to three 
injections per eye may be administered within six months of treatment initiation if there are signs of 
disease activity. Most patients (78%) in the 24-week RAINBOW clinical study received one injection 
per eye. Patients who were treated with 0.2 mg in this clinical study did not require additional 
treatment in the subsequent long-term extension study which followed the patients up to five years of 
age (see section 5.1). The administration of more than three injections per eye has not been studied. 
The interval between two doses injected into the same eye should be at least four weeks. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Lucentis has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. However, no special considerations 
are needed in this population. 
Renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is not needed in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in the elderly. There is limited experience in patients older than 
75 years with DME.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Lucentis in children and adolescents below 18 years of age for indications 
other than retinopathy of prematurity have not been established. Available data in adolescent patients 
aged 12 to 17 years with visual impairment due to CNV are described in section 5.1 but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Single-use vial for intravitreal use only. 
Since the volume contained in the vial (0.23 ml) is greater than the recommended dose (0.05 ml for 
adults and 0.02 ml for preterm infants), a portion of the volume contained in the vial must be discarded 
prior to administration. 
Lucentis should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
For information on preparation of Lucentis, see section 6.6. 
The injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the use of 
surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) 
and the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). The patient’s medical history for 
hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to performing the intravitreal procedure 
(see section 4.4). Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the 
periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection, in accordance 
with local practice. 
Adults 
In adults the injection needle should be inserted 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous 
cavity, avoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection 
volume of 0.05 ml is then delivered; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections. 
Paediatric population 
For treatment of preterm infants the low volume high accuracy syringe provided together with an 
injection needle (30G x ½″) in the VISISURE kit should be used (see also section 6.6). 
In preterm infants, the injection needle should be inserted into the eye 1.0 to 2.0 mm posterior to the 
limbus, with the needle pointing towards the optic nerve. The injection volume of 0.02 ml is then 
delivered. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections. 
Patients with active severe intraocular inflammation. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Intravitreal injection-related reactions 
Intravitreous injections, including those with Lucentis, have been associated with endophthalmitis, 
intraocular inflammation, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic 
cataract (see section 4.8). Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering 
Lucentis. In addition, patients should be monitored during the week following the injection to permit 
early treatment if an infection occurs. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive 
of endophthalmitis or any of the above mentioned events without delay. 
Intraocular pressure increases 
In adults transient increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been seen within 60 minutes of 
injection of Lucentis. Sustained IOP increases have also been identified (see section 4.8). Both 
intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head must be monitored and managed 
appropriately. 
Patients should be informed of the symptoms of these potential adverse reactions and instructed to 
inform their physician if they develop signs such as eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye 
redness, blurred or decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in their vision, or 
increased sensitivity to light (see section 4.8). 
Bilateral treatment 
Limited data on bilateral use of Lucentis (including same-day administration) do not suggest an 
increased risk of systemic adverse events compared with unilateral treatment. 
Immunogenicity 
There is a potential for immunogenicity with Lucentis. Since there is a potential for an increased 
systemic exposure in subjects with DME, an increased risk for developing hypersensitivity in this 
patient population cannot be excluded. Patients should also be instructed to report if an intraocular 
inflammation increases in severity, which may be a clinical sign attributable to intraocular antibody 
formation. 
Concomitant use of other anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
Lucentis should not be administered concurrently with other anti-VEGF medicinal products (systemic 
or ocular). 
Withholding Lucentis in adults 
The dose should be withheld and treatment should not be resumed earlier than the next scheduled 
treatment in the event of: 
• 
a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥30 letters compared with the last 
assessment of visual acuity; 
an intraocular pressure of ≥30 mmHg; 
a retinal break; 
a subretinal haemorrhage involving the centre of the fovea, or, if the size of the haemorrhage is 
≥50%, of the total lesion area; 
performed or planned intraocular surgery within the previous or next 28 days. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Retinal pigment epithelial tear 
Risk factors associated with the development of a retinal pigment epithelial tear after anti-VEGF 
therapy for wet AMD and potentially also other forms of CNV, include a large and/or high pigment 
epithelial retinal detachment. When initiating ranibizumab therapy, caution should be used in patients 
with these risk factors for retinal pigment epithelial tears. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular holes in adults 
Treatment should be discontinued in subjects with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or stage 3 or 4 
macular holes. 
Paediatric population 
The warnings and precautions for adults also apply to preterm infants with ROP. Long-term safety in 
preterm infants with ROP has been studied in the RAINBOW extension study up to the age of five 
years old. The safety profile of ranibizumab 0.2 mg during the extension study was consistent with 
that observed in the core study at 24 weeks (see section 4.8). 
Populations with limited data 
There is only limited experience in the treatment of subjects with DME due to type I diabetes. 
Lucentis has not been studied in patients who have previously received intravitreal injections, in 
patients with active systemic infections, or in patients with concurrent eye conditions such as retinal 
detachment or macular hole. There is limited experience of treatment with Lucentis in diabetic patients 
with an HbA1c over 108 mmol/mol (12%) and no experience in patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension. This lack of information should be considered by the physician when treating such 
patients. 
There are insufficient data to conclude on the effect of Lucentis in patients with RVO presenting 
irreversible ischaemic visual function loss. 
In patients with PM, there are limited data on the effect of Lucentis in patients who have previously 
undergone unsuccessful verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT) treatment. Also, while a consistent 
effect was observed in subjects with subfoveal and juxtafoveal lesions, there are insufficient data to 
conclude on the effect of Lucentis in PM subjects with extrafoveal lesions. 
Systemic effects following intravitreal use 
Systemic adverse events including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic events have 
been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors. 
There are limited data on safety in the treatment of DME, macular oedema due to RVO and CNV 
secondary to PM patients with prior history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks. Caution should be 
exercised when treating such patients (see section 4.8). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal interaction studies have been performed. 
For the adjunctive use of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) and Lucentis in wet AMD and PM, 
see section 5.1. 
For the adjunctive use of laser photocoagulation and Lucentis in DME and BRVO, see sections 4.2 
and 5.1. 
In clinical studies for the treatment of visual impairment due to DME, the outcome with regard to 
visual acuity or central retinal subfield thickness (CSFT) in patients treated with Lucentis was not 
affected by concomitant treatment with thiazolidinediones. 
Paediatric population 
No interaction studies have been performed.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment. 
Pregnancy 
For ranibizumab no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy or 
embryonal/foetal development (see section 5.3). The systemic exposure to ranibizumab is low after 
ocular administration, but due to its mechanism of action, ranibizumab must be regarded as potentially 
teratogenic and embryo-/foetotoxic. Therefore, ranibizumab should not be used during pregnancy 
unless the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. For women who wish to become 
pregnant and have been treated with ranibizumab, it is recommended to wait at least 3 months after the 
last dose of ranibizumab before conceiving a child. 
Breast-feeding 
Based on very limited data, ranibizumab may be excreted in human milk at low levels. The effect of 
ranibizumab on a breast-fed newborn/infant is unknown. As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding is 
not recommended during the use of Lucentis. 
Fertility 
There are no data available on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The treatment procedure may induce temporary visual disturbances, which may affect the ability to 
drive or use machines (see section 4.8). Patients who experience these signs must not drive or use 
machines until these temporary visual disturbances subside. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The majority of adverse reactions reported following administration of Lucentis are related to the 
intravitreal injection procedure. 
The most frequently reported ocular adverse reactions following injection of Lucentis are: eye pain, 
ocular hyperaemia, increased intraocular pressure, vitritis, vitreous detachment, retinal haemorrhage, 
visual disturbance, vitreous floaters, conjunctival haemorrhage, eye irritation, foreign body sensation 
in eyes, increased lacrimation, blepharitis, dry eye and eye pruritus. 
The most frequently reported non-ocular adverse reactions are headache, nasopharyngitis and 
arthralgia. 
Less frequently reported, but more serious, adverse reactions include endophthalmitis, blindness, 
retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic cataract (see section 4.4). 
The adverse reactions experienced following administration of Lucentis in clinical studies are 
summarised in the table below.

Investigations 
Very common 
# Adverse reactions were defined as adverse events (in at least 0.5 percentage points of patients) 
which occurred at a higher rate (at least 2 percentage points) in patients receiving treatment with 
Lucentis 0.5 mg than in those receiving control treatment (sham or verteporfin PDT). 
* observed only in DME population 
Intraocular pressure increased 
Product-class-related adverse reactions 
In the wet AMD phase III studies, the overall frequency of non-ocular haemorrhages, an adverse event 
potentially related to systemic VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibition, was slightly 
increased in ranibizumab-treated patients. However, there was no consistent pattern among the 
different haemorrhages. There is a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke 
and myocardial infarction, following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. A low incidence rate of 
arterial thromboembolic events was observed in the Lucentis clinical studies in patients with AMD, 
DME, PDR, RVO and CNV and there were no major differences between the groups treated with 
ranibizumab compared to control. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of Lucentis 0.2 mg was studied in a 6-month clinical study (RAINBOW), which included 
73 preterm infants with ROP treated with ranibizumab 0.2 mg (see section 5.1). Ocular adverse 
reactions reported in more than one patient treated with ranibizumab 0.2 mg were retinal haemorrhage 
and conjunctival haemorrhage. Non-ocular adverse reactions reported in more than one patient treated 
with ranibizumab 0.2 mg were nasopharyngitis, anaemia, cough, urinary tract infection and allergic 
reactions. Adverse reactions established for adult indications are considered applicable to preterm 
infants with ROP, though not all were observed in the RAINBOW study. 
Long-term safety in preterm infants with ROP has been studied up to the age of five years old in the 
RAINBOW extension study and showed no new safety signals. The safety profile of ranibizumab 
0.2 mg during the extension study was consistent with that observed in the core study at 24 weeks. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Cases of accidental overdose have been reported from the clinical studies in wet AMD and post-
marketing data. Adverse reactions associated with these reported cases were intraocular pressure 
increased, transient blindness, reduced visual acuity, corneal oedema, corneal pain, and eye pain. If an 
overdose occurs, intraocular pressure should be monitored and treated, if deemed necessary by the 
attending physician.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, antineovascularisation agents, ATC code: S01LA04 
Mechanism of action 
Ranibizumab is a humanised recombinant monoclonal antibody fragment targeted against human 
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It binds with high affinity to the VEGF-A isoforms 
(e.g. VEGF110, VEGF121 and VEGF165), thereby preventing binding of VEGF-A to its receptors 
VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. Binding of VEGF-A to its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation 
and neovascularisation, as well as vascular leakage, all of which are thought to contribute to the 
progression of the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia and CNV 
or to visual impairment caused by either diabetic macular oedema or macular oedema secondary to 
RVO in adults and retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Treatment of wet AMD 
In wet AMD, the clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis have been assessed in three randomised, 
double-masked, sham- or active-controlled studies of 24 months duration in patients with neovascular 
AMD. A total of 1,323 patients (879 active and 444 control) were enrolled in these studies. 
In study FVF2598g (MARINA), 716 patients with minimally classic or occult with no classic lesions 
were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive monthly injections of Lucentis 0.3 mg, Lucentis 0.5 mg or 
sham. 
In study FVF2587g (ANCHOR), 423 patients with predominantly classic CNV lesions were 
randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Lucentis 0.3 mg monthly, Lucentis 0.5 mg monthly or 
verteporfin PDT (at baseline and every 3 months thereafter if fluorescein angiography showed 
persistence or recurrence of vascular leakage). 
Key outcome measures are summarised in Table 1 and Figure 1.

Figure 1  Mean change in visual acuity from baseline to Month 24 in study FVF2598g 
(MARINA) and study FVF2587g (ANCHOR) 
Results from both studies indicated that continued ranibizumab treatment may also be of benefit in 
patients who lost ≥15 letters of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the first year of treatment. 
Statistically significant patient-reported visual functioning benefits were observed in both MARINA 
and ANCHOR with ranibizumab treatment over the control group as measured by the NEI VFQ-25. 
In study FVF3192g (PIER), 184 patients with all forms of neovascular AMD were randomised in a 
1:1:1 ratio to receive Lucentis 0.3 mg, Lucentis 0.5 mg or sham injections once a month for 
3 consecutive doses, followed by a dose administered once every 3 months. From Month 14 of the 
study, sham-treated patients were allowed to receive ranibizumab and from Month 19, more frequent 
treatments were possible. Patients treated with Lucentis in PIER received a mean of 10 total 
treatments.

After an initial increase in visual acuity (following monthly dosing), on average, patients’ visual acuity 
declined with quarterly dosing, returning to baseline at Month 12 and this effect was maintained in 
most ranibizumab-treated patients (82%) at Month 24. Limited data from sham subjects who later 
received ranibizumab suggested that early initiation of treatment may be associated with better 
preservation of visual acuity. 
Data from two studies (MONT BLANC, BPD952A2308 and DENALI, BPD952A2309) conducted 
post approval confirmed the efficacy of Lucentis but did not demonstrate additional effect of the 
combined administration of verteporfin (Visudyne PDT) and Lucentis compared to Lucentis 
monotherapy. 
Treatment of visual impairment due to CNV secondary to PM 
The clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis in patients with visual impairment due to CNV in PM have 
been assessed based on the 12-month data of the double-masked, controlled pivotal study F2301 
(RADIANCE). In this study 277 patients were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to the following arms: 
• 
Group I (ranibizumab 0.5 mg, dosing regimen driven by “stability” criteria defined as no change 
in BCVA compared to two preceding monthly evaluations). 
Group II (ranibizumab 0.5 mg, dosing regimen driven by “disease activity” criteria defined as 
vision impairment attributable to intra- or subretinal fluid or active leakage due to the CNV 
lesion as assessed by optical coherence tomography and/or fluorescence angiography). 
Group III (vPDT - patients were allowed to receive ranibizumab treatment as of Month 3). 
• 
In Group II, which is the recommended posology (see section 4.2), 50.9% of patients required 1 or 
2 injections, 34.5% required 3 to 5 injections and 14.7% required 6 to 12 injections over the 12-month 
study period. 62.9% of Group II patients did not require injections in the second 6 months of the study. 
• 
The key outcomes from RADIANCE are summarised in Table 2 and Figure 2.

Figure 2  Mean change from baseline BCVA over time to Month 12 (RADIANCE) 
The improvement of vision was accompanied by a reduction in central retinal thickness. 
Patient-reported benefits were observed with ranibizumab treatment arms over vPDT (p-value <0.05) 
in terms of improvement in the composite score and several subscales (general vision, near activities, 
mental health and dependency) of the NEI VFQ-25. 
Treatment of visual impairment due to CNV (other than secondary to PM and wet AMD) 
The clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis in patients with visual impairment due to CNV have been 
assessed based on the 12-month data of the double-masked, sham-controlled pivotal study G2301 
(MINERVA). In this study 178 adult patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive: 
• 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg at baseline, followed by an individualised dosing regimen driven by disease 
activity as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters (e.g. visual acuity 
impairment, intra/sub-retinal fluid, haemorrhage or leakage); 
sham injection at baseline, followed by an individualised treatment regimen driven by disease 
activity. 
• 
At Month 2, all patients received open-label treatment with ranibizumab as needed. 
Key outcome measures from MINERVA are summarised in Table 3 and Figure 3. An improvement of 
vision was observed and was accompanied by a reduction in central subfield thickness over the 
12-month period. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean number of injections given over 12 months was 5.8 in the ranibizumab arm versus 5.4 in 
those patients in the sham arm who were eligible to receive ranibizumab from Month 2 onwards. In 
the sham arm 7 out of 59 patients did not receive any treatment with ranibizumab in the study eye 
during the 12-month period.

In the pivotal study G2301 (MINERVA), five adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years with visual 
impairment secondary to CNV received open-label treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg at baseline 
followed by an individualised treatment regimen as for the adult population. BCVA improved from 
baseline to Month 12 in all five patients, ranging from 5 to 38 letters (mean of 16.6 letters). The 
improvement of vision was accompanied by a stabilisation or reduction in central subfield thickness 
over the 12-month period. The mean number of ranibizumab injections given in the study eye over 
12 months was 3 (ranged from 2 to 5). Overall, ranibizumab treatment was well tolerated. 
Treatment of visual impairment due to DME 
The efficacy and safety of Lucentis have been assessed in three randomised, controlled studies of at 
least 12 months duration. A total of 868 patients (708 active and 160 control) were enrolled in these 
studies. 
In the phase II study D2201 (RESOLVE), 151 patients were treated with ranibizumab (6 mg/ml, n=51, 
10 mg/ml, n=51) or sham (n=49) by monthly intravitreal injections. The mean average change in 
BCVA from Month 1 to Month 12 compared to baseline was +7.8 (±7.72) letters in the pooled 
ranibizumab-treated patients (n=102), compared to -0.1 (±9.77) letters for sham-treated patients; and 
the mean change in BCVA at Month 12 from baseline was 10.3 (±9.1) letters compared to -1.4 (±14.2) 
letters, respectively (p<0.0001 for the treatment difference). 
In the phase III study D2301 (RESTORE), 345 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy and sham laser photocoagulation, combined ranibizumab 0.5 mg 
and laser photocoagulation or sham injection and laser photocoagulation. 240 patients, who had 
previously completed the 12-month RESTORE study, were enrolled in the open-label, multicentre 
24-month extension (RESTORE Extension) study. Patients were treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg pro 
re nata (PRN) in the same eye as the core study (D2301 RESTORE).

The effect at 12 months was consistent in most subgroups. However, subjects with a baseline BCVA 
>73 letters and macular oedema with central retinal thickness <300 µm did not appear to benefit from 
treatment with ranibizumab compared to laser photocoagulation.

Statistically significant patient-reported benefits for most vision-related functions were observed with 
ranibizumab (with or without laser) treatment over the control group as measured by the NEI VFQ-25. 
For other subscales of this questionnaire no treatment differences could be established. 
The long-term safety profile of ranibizumab observed in the 24-month extension study is consistent 
with the known Lucentis safety profile. 
In the phase IIIb study D2304 (RETAIN), 372 patients were randomised in 1:1:1 ratio to receive: 
• 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg with concomitant laser photocoagulation on a treat-and-extend (TE) 
regimen, 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy on a TE regimen, 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy on a PRN regimen. 
• 
• 
In all groups, ranibizumab was administered monthly until BCVA was stable for at least three 
consecutive monthly assessments. On TE, ranibizumab was administered at treatment intervals of 
2-3 months. In all groups, monthly treatment was re-initiated upon a decrease in BCVA due to DME 
progression and continued until stable BCVA was reached again. 
The number of scheduled treatment visits after the initial 3 injections, was 13 and 20 for the TE and 
PRN regimens, respectively. With both TE regimens, more than 70% of patients maintained their 
BCVA with an average visit frequency of ≥2 months.

In DME studies, the improvement in BCVA was accompanied by a reduction over time in mean CSFT 
in all the treatment groups. 
Treatment of PDR 
The clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis in patients with PDR have been assessed in Protocol S 
which evaluated the treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections compared with 
panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). The primary endpoint was the mean visual acuity change at year 2. 
Additionally, change in diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity was assessed based on fundus photographs 
using the DR severity score (DRSS). 
Protocol S was a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, parallel-assignment, non-inferiority 
phase III study in which 305 patients (394 study eyes) with PDR with or without DME at baseline 
were enrolled. The study compared ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections to standard treatment 
with PRP. A total of 191 eyes (48.5%) were randomised to ranibizumab 0.5 mg and 203 eyes (51.5%) 
eyes were randomised to PRP. A total of 88 eyes (22.3%) had baseline DME: 42 (22.0%) and 
46 (22.7%) eyes in the ranibizumab and PRP groups, respectively. 
In this study, the mean visual acuity change at year 2 was +2.7 letters in the ranibizumab group 
compared to -0.7 letters in the PRP group. The difference in least square means was 3.5 letters (95% 
CI: [0.2 to 6.7]). 
At year 1, 41.8% of eyes experienced a ≥2-step improvement in the DRSS when treated with 
ranibizumab (n=189) compared to 14.6% of eyes treated with PRP (n=199). The estimated difference 
between ranibizumab and laser was 27.4% (95% CI: [18.9, 35.9]).

At year 1 in the ranibizumab-treated group in Protocol S, ≥2-step improvement in DRSS was 
consistent in eyes without DME (39.9%) and with baseline DME (48.8%). 
An analysis of year 2 data from Protocol S demonstrated that 42.3% (n=80) of eyes in the 
ranibizumab-treated group had ≥2-step improvement in DRSS from baseline compared with 23.1% 
(n=46) of eyes in the PRP group. In the ranibizumab-treated group, ≥2-step improvement in DRSS 
from baseline was observed in 58.5% (n=24) of eyes with baseline DME and 37.8% (n=56) of eyes 
without DME. 
DRSS was also assessed in three separate active-controlled phase III DME studies (ranibizumab 
0.5 mg PRN vs laser) that included a total of 875 patients, of whom approximately 75% were of Asian 
origin. In a meta-analysis of these studies, 48.4% of the 315 patients with gradable DRSS scores in the 
subgroup of patients with moderately severe non-proliferative DR (NPDR) or worse at baseline 
experienced a ≥2-step improvement in the DRSS at Month 12 when treated with ranibizumab (n=192) 
vs 14.6% of patients treated with laser (n=123). The estimated difference between ranibizumab and 
laser was 29.9% (95% CI: [20.0, 39.7]). In the 405 DRSS gradable patients with moderate NPDR or 
better, a ≥2-step DRSS improvement was observed in 1.4% and 0.9% of the ranibizumab and laser 
groups, respectively. 
Treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to RVO 
The clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis in patients with visual impairment due to macular oedema 
secondary to RVO have been assessed in the randomised, double-masked, controlled studies BRAVO 
and CRUISE that recruited subjects with BRVO (n=397) and CRVO (n=392), respectively. In both 
studies, subjects received either 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab or sham injections. After 6 months, 
patients in the sham-control arms switched to 0.5 mg ranibizumab.

In both studies, the improvement of vision was accompanied by a continuous and significant reduction 
in the macular oedema as measured by central retinal thickness. 
In patients with CRVO (CRUISE and extension study HORIZON): Subjects treated with sham in the 
first 6 months who subsequently received ranibizumab did not achieve comparable gains in visual 
acuity by Month 24 (~6 letters) compared to subjects treated with ranibizumab from study start 
(~12 letters). 
Statistically significant patient-reported benefits in subscales related to near and distance activity were 
observed with ranibizumab treatment over the control group as measured by the NEI VFQ-25. 
The long-term (24 months) clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis in patients with visual impairment 
due to macular oedema secondary to RVO were assessed in the BRIGHTER (BRVO) and CRYSTAL 
(CRVO) studies. In both studies, subjects received a 0.5 mg ranibizumab PRN dosing regimen driven 
by individualised stabilisation criteria. BRIGHTER was a 3-arm randomised active-controlled study 
that compared 0.5 mg ranibizumab given as monotherapy or in combination with adjunctive laser 
photocoagulation to laser photocoagulation alone. After 6 months, subjects in the laser arm could 
receive 0.5 mg ranibizumab. CRYSTAL was a single-arm study with 0.5 mg ranibizumab 
monotherapy.

b 
* 
In BRIGHTER, ranibizumab 0.5 mg with adjunctive laser therapy demonstrated non-inferiority versus 
ranibizumab monotherapy from baseline to Month 24 (95% CI -2.8, 1.4). 
In both studies, a rapid and statistically significant decrease from baseline in central retinal subfield 
thickness was observed at Month 1. This effect was maintained up to Month 24. 
The effect of ranibizumab treatment was similar irrespective of the presence of retinal ischaemia. In 
BRIGHTER, patients with ischaemia present (N=46) or absent (N=133) and treated with ranibizumab 
monotherapy had a mean change from baseline of +15.3 and +15.6 letters, respectively, at Month 24. 
In CRYSTAL, patients with ischaemia present (N=53) or absent (N=300) and treated with 
ranibizumab monotherapy had a mean change from baseline of +15.0 and +11.5 letters, respectively. 
The effect in terms of visual improvement was observed in all patients treated with 0.5 mg 
ranibizumab monotherapy regardless of their disease duration in both BRIGHTER and CRYSTAL. In 
patients with <3 months disease duration an increase in visual acuity of 13.3 and 10.0 letters was seen 
at Month 1; and 17.7 and 13.2 letters at Month 24 in BRIGHTER and CRYSTAL, respectively. The 
corresponding visual acuity gain in patients with ≥12 months disease duration was 8.6 and 8.4 letters 
in the respective studies. Treatment initiation at the time of diagnosis should be considered. 
The long-term safety profile of ranibizumab observed in the 24-month studies is consistent with the 
known Lucentis safety profile.

Paediatric population 
Treatment of ROP in preterm infants 
The clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis 0.2 mg for the treatment of ROP in preterm infants have 
been assessed based on the 6-month data of the randomised, open-label, 3-arm, parallel-group 
superiority study H2301 (RAINBOW), which was designed to evaluate ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 
0.1 mg given as intravitreal injections in comparison to laser therapy. Eligible patients had one of the 
following retinal findings in each eye: 
• 
• 
• 
Zone I, stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+ disease, or 
Zone II, stage 3+ disease, or 
Aggressive posterior (AP)-ROP 
In this study, 225 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive intravitreal ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
(n=74), 0.1 mg (n=77), or laser therapy (n=74). 
Treatment success, as measured by the absence of active ROP and absence of unfavourable structural 
outcomes in both eyes 24 weeks after the first study treatment, was highest with ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
(80%) compared to laser therapy (66.2%) (see Table 10). The majority of patients treated with 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg (78.1%) received a single injection per eye.

During the 24 weeks of the study, fewer patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group switched to another 
treatment modality due to lack of response compared with the laser group (14.9% vs. 24.3%). 
Unfavourable structural outcomes were less frequently reported for ranibizumab 0.2 mg (1 patient, 
1.4%) compared with laser therapy (7 patients, 10.1%). 
The long-term efficacy and safety of ranibizumab 0.2 mg for the treatment of ROP in preterm infants 
have been assessed in study H2301E1 (RAINBOW extension), an extension study of study H2301 
(RAINBOW), following patients to their 5th birthday. 
The primary objective was to evaluate visual function at the patient’s 5th birthday visit by assessing 
visual acuity using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) with Lea symbols optotypes 
in the better-seeing eye (the eye with the higher ETDRS score). 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An ETDRS score in patients who completed the 5th birthday visit was recorded for 83.3% (45/54) and 
76.6% (36/47) of patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm and the laser arm, respectively. The 
least-squares (LS) mean (SE) was numerically higher in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm (66.8 [1.95]) 
compared to the laser arm (62.1 [2.18]) with a difference in LS mean ETDRS score of 4.7 (95% 
CI: -1.1, 10.5). The categorised visual acuity outcomes in the better-seeing eye at the patients’ 5th 
birthday is presented in Table 11.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Lucentis in all subsets of the paediatric population in neovascular AMD, visual impairment due to 
DME, visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to RVO, visual impairment due to CNV 
and diabetic retinopathy (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). In addition the European 
Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Lucentis in the 
following subsets of the paediatric population for ROP: term newborn infants, infants, children and 
adolescents. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following monthly intravitreal administration of Lucentis to patients with neovascular AMD, serum 
concentrations of ranibizumab were generally low, with maximum levels (Cmax) generally below the 
ranibizumab concentration necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF by 50% (11-27 ng/ml, 
as assessed in an in vitro cellular proliferation assay). Cmax was dose proportional over the dose range 
of 0.05 to 1.0 mg/eye. Serum concentrations in a limited number of DME patients indicate that a 
slightly higher systemic exposure cannot be excluded compared to those observed in neovascular 
AMD patients. Serum ranibizumab concentrations in RVO patients were similar or slightly higher 
compared to those observed in neovascular AMD patients. 
Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics and disappearance of ranibizumab from serum for 
patients with neovascular AMD treated with the 0.5 mg dose, the average vitreous elimination half-life 
of ranibizumab is approximately 9 days. Upon monthly intravitreal administration of Lucentis 
0.5 mg/eye, serum ranibizumab Cmax, attained approximately 1 day after dosing, is predicted to 
generally range between 0.79 and 2.90 ng/ml, and Cmin is predicted to generally range between 0.07 
and 0.49 ng/ml. Serum ranibizumab concentrations are predicted to be approximately 90,000-fold 
lower than vitreal ranibizumab concentrations. 
Patients with renal impairment: No formal studies have been conducted to examine the 
pharmacokinetics of Lucentis in patients with renal impairment. In a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis of neovascular AMD patients, 68% (136 of 200) of patients had renal impairment (46.5% 
mild [50-80 ml/min], 20% moderate [30-50 ml/min], and 1.5% severe [<30 ml/min]). In RVO 
patients, 48.2% (253 of 525) had renal impairment (36.4% mild, 9.5% moderate and 2.3% severe). 
Systemic clearance was slightly lower, but this was not clinically significant. 
Hepatic impairment: No formal studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of 
Lucentis in patients with hepatic impairment. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Following intravitreal administration of Lucentis to preterm infants with ROP at a dose of 0.2 mg (per 
eye), serum ranibizumab concentrations were higher than those observed in neovascular AMD adult 
patients receiving 0.5 mg in one eye. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the differences 
in Cmax and AUCinf were approximately 16-fold and 12-fold higher, respectively. The apparent 
systemic half-life was approximately 6 days. A PK/PD analysis showed no clear relationship between 
systemic ranibizumab concentrations and systemic VEGF concentrations. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Bilateral intravitreal administration of ranibizumab to cynomolgus monkeys at doses between 
0.25 mg/eye and 2.0 mg/eye once every 2 weeks for up to 26 weeks resulted in dose-dependent ocular 
effects. 
Intraocularly, there were dose-dependent increases in anterior chamber flare and cells with a peak 
2 days after injection. The severity of the inflammatory response generally diminished with 
subsequent injections or during recovery. In the posterior segment, there were vitreal cell infiltration 
and floaters, which also tended to be dose-dependent and generally persisted to the end of the 
treatment period. In the 26-week study, the severity of the vitreous inflammation increased with the 
number of injections. However, evidence of reversibility was observed after recovery. The nature and 
timing of the posterior segment inflammation is suggestive of an immune-mediated antibody response, 
which may be clinically irrelevant. Cataract formation was observed in some animals after a relatively 
long period of intense inflammation, suggesting that the lens changes were secondary to severe 
inflammation. A transient increase in post-dose intraocular pressure was observed following 
intravitreal injections, irrespective of dose. 
Microscopic ocular changes were related to inflammation and did not indicate degenerative processes. 
Granulomatous inflammatory changes were noted in the optic disc of some eyes. These posterior 
segment changes diminished, and in some instances resolved, during the recovery period. 
Following intravitreal administration, no signs of systemic toxicity were detected. Serum and vitreous 
antibodies to ranibizumab were found in a subset of treated animals. 
No carcinogenicity or mutagenicity data are available. 
In pregnant monkeys, intravitreal ranibizumab treatment resulting in maximal systemic exposures 
0.9-7-fold a worst case clinical exposure did not elicit developmental toxicity or teratogenicity, and 
had no effect on weight or structure of the placenta, although, based on its pharmacological effect 
ranibizumab should be regarded as potentially teratogenic and embryo-/foetotoxic. 
The absence of ranibizumab-mediated effects on embryo-foetal development is plausibly related 
mainly to the inability of the Fab fragment to cross the placenta. Nevertheless, a case was described 
with high maternal ranibizumab serum levels and presence of ranibizumab in foetal serum, suggesting 
that the anti-ranibizumab antibody acted as (Fc region containing) carrier protein for ranibizumab, 
thereby decreasing its maternal serum clearance and enabling its placental transfer. As the embryo-
foetal development investigations were performed in healthy pregnant animals and disease (such as 
diabetes) may modify the permeability of the placenta towards a Fab fragment, the study should be 
interpreted with caution.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Lucentis is indicated in adults for: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 
The treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) 
The treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) 
The treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion 
(branch RVO or central RVO) 
The treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) 
• 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Lucentis must be administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections. 
Posology 
The recommended dose for Lucentis is 0.5 mg given as a single intravitreal injection. This 
corresponds to an injection volume of 0.05 ml. The interval between two doses injected into the same 
eye should be at least four weeks. 
Treatment is initiated with one injection per month until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or 
there are no signs of disease activity i.e. no change in visual acuity and in other signs and symptoms of 
the disease under continued treatment. In patients with wet AMD, DME, PDR and RVO, initially, 
three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed. 
Thereafter, monitoring and treatment intervals should be determined by the physician and should be 
based on disease activity, as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters. 
If, in the physician’s opinion, visual and anatomic parameters indicate that the patient is not benefiting 
from continued treatment, Lucentis should be discontinued. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging 
techniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography). 
If patients are being treated according to a treat-and-extend regimen, once maximum visual acuity is 
achieved and/or there are no signs of disease activity, the treatment intervals can be extended stepwise 
until signs of disease activity or visual impairment recur. The treatment interval should be extended by 
no more than two weeks at a time for wet AMD and may be extended by up to one month at a time for 
DME. For PDR and RVO, treatment intervals may also be gradually extended, however there are 
insufficient data to conclude on the length of these intervals. If disease activity recurs, the treatment 
interval should be shortened accordingly. 
The treatment of visual impairment due to CNV should be determined individually per patient based 
on disease activity. Some patients may only need one injection during the first 12 months; others may 
need more frequent treatment, including a monthly injection. For CNV secondary to pathologic 
myopia (PM), many patients may only need one or two injections during the first year (see 
section 5.1). 
Lucentis and laser photocoagulation in DME and in macular oedema secondary to BRVO 
There is some experience of Lucentis administered concomitantly with laser photocoagulation (see 
section 5.1). When given on the same day, Lucentis should be administered at least 30 minutes after 
laser photocoagulation. Lucentis can be administered in patients who have received previous laser 
photocoagulation. 
Lucentis and verteporfin photodynamic therapy in CNV secondary to PM 
There is no experience of concomitant administration of Lucentis and verteporfin. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Lucentis has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. However, no special considerations 
are needed in this population. 
Renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is not needed in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in the elderly. There is limited experience in patients older than 
75 years with DME. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Lucentis in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been 
established. Available data in adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years with visual impairment due to 
CNV are described in section 5.1. 
Method of administration 
Single-use pre-filled syringe for intravitreal use only. The pre-filled syringe contains more than the 
recommended dose of 0.5 mg. The extractable volume of the pre-filled syringe (0.1 ml) is not to be 
used in total. The excess volume should be expelled prior to injection. Injecting the entire volume of 
the pre-filled syringe could result in overdose. To expel the air bubble along with the excess medicinal 
product, slowly push the plunger until the edge below the dome of the rubber stopper is aligned with 
the black dosing line on the syringe (equivalent to 0.05 ml, i.e., 0.5 mg ranibizumab). 
Lucentis should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the use of 
surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) 
and the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). The patient’s medical history for 
hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to performing the intravitreal procedure 
(see section 4.4). Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the 
periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection, in accordance 
with local practice. 
For information on preparation of Lucentis, see section 6.6. 
The injection needle should be inserted 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous cavity, 
avoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection volume of 
0.05 ml is then delivered; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections. Each pre-
filled syringe should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections. 
Patients with active severe intraocular inflammation. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Intravitreal injection-related reactions 
Intravitreous injections, including those with Lucentis, have been associated with endophthalmitis, 
intraocular inflammation, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic 
cataract (see section 4.8). Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering 
Lucentis. In addition, patients should be monitored during the week following the injection to permit 
early treatment if an infection occurs. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive 
of endophthalmitis or any of the above mentioned events without delay. 
Intraocular pressure increases 
Transient increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been seen within 60 minutes of injection of 
Lucentis. Sustained IOP increases have also been identified (see section 4.8). Both intraocular pressure 
and the perfusion of the optic nerve head must be monitored and managed appropriately. 
Patients should be informed of the symptoms of these potential adverse reactions and instructed to 
inform their physician if they develop signs such as eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye 
redness, blurred or decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in their vision, or 
increased sensitivity to light (see section 4.8). 
Bilateral treatment 
Limited data on bilateral use of Lucentis (including same-day administration) do not suggest an 
increased risk of systemic adverse events compared with unilateral treatment. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity 
There is a potential for immunogenicity with Lucentis. Since there is a potential for an increased 
systemic exposure in subjects with DME, an increased risk for developing hypersensitivity in this 
patient population cannot be excluded. Patients should also be instructed to report if an intraocular 
inflammation increases in severity, which may be a clinical sign attributable to intraocular antibody 
formation. 
Concomitant use of other anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
Lucentis should not be administered concurrently with other anti-VEGF medicinal products (systemic 
or ocular). 
Withholding Lucentis 
The dose should be withheld and treatment should not be resumed earlier than the next scheduled 
treatment in the event of: 
• 
a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥30 letters compared with the last 
assessment of visual acuity; 
an intraocular pressure of ≥30 mmHg; 
a retinal break; 
a subretinal haemorrhage involving the centre of the fovea, or, if the size of the haemorrhage is 
≥50%, of the total lesion area; 
performed or planned intraocular surgery within the previous or next 28 days. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Retinal pigment epithelial tear 
Risk factors associated with the development of a retinal pigment epithelial tear after anti-VEGF 
therapy for wet AMD and potentially also other forms of CNV, include a large and/or high pigment 
epithelial retinal detachment. When initiating ranibizumab therapy, caution should be used in patients 
with these risk factors for retinal pigment epithelial tears. 
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular holes 
Treatment should be discontinued in subjects with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or stage 3 or 4 
macular holes. 
Populations with limited data 
There is only limited experience in the treatment of subjects with DME due to type I diabetes. 
Lucentis has not been studied in patients who have previously received intravitreal injections, in 
patients with active systemic infections, or in patients with concurrent eye conditions such as retinal 
detachment or macular hole. There is limited experience of treatment with Lucentis in diabetic patients 
with an HbA1c over 108 mmol/mol (12%) and no experience in patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension. This lack of information should be considered by the physician when treating such 
patients. 
There are insufficient data to conclude on the effect of Lucentis in patients with RVO presenting 
irreversible ischaemic visual function loss. 
In patients with PM, there are limited data on the effect of Lucentis in patients who have previously 
undergone unsuccessful verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT) treatment. Also, while a consistent 
effect was observed in subjects with subfoveal and juxtafoveal lesions, there are insufficient data to 
conclude on the effect of Lucentis in PM subjects with extrafoveal lesions. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Systemic effects following intravitreal use 
Systemic adverse events including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic events have 
been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors. 
There are limited data on safety in the treatment of DME, macular oedema due to RVO and CNV 
secondary to PM patients with prior history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks. Caution should be 
exercised when treating such patients (see section 4.8). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal interaction studies have been performed. 
For the adjunctive use of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) and Lucentis in wet AMD and PM, 
see section 5.1. 
For the adjunctive use of laser photocoagulation and Lucentis in DME and BRVO, see sections 4.2 
and 5.1. 
In clinical studies for the treatment of visual impairment due to DME, the outcome with regard to 
visual acuity or central retinal subfield thickness (CSFT) in patients treated with Lucentis was not 
affected by concomitant treatment with thiazolidinediones. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment. 
Pregnancy 
For ranibizumab no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy or 
embryonal/foetal development (see section 5.3). The systemic exposure to ranibizumab is low after 
ocular administration, but due to its mechanism of action, ranibizumab must be regarded as potentially 
teratogenic and embryo-/foetotoxic. Therefore, ranibizumab should not be used during pregnancy 
unless the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. For women who wish to become 
pregnant and have been treated with ranibizumab, it is recommended to wait at least 3 months after the 
last dose of ranibizumab before conceiving a child. 
Breast-feeding 
Based on very limited data, ranibizumab may be excreted in human milk at low levels. The effect of 
ranibizumab on a breast-fed newborn/infant is unknown. As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding is 
not recommended during the use of Lucentis. 
Fertility 
There are no data available on fertility.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The treatment procedure may induce temporary visual disturbances, which may affect the ability to 
drive or use machines (see section 4.8). Patients who experience these signs must not drive or use 
machines until these temporary visual disturbances subside. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

# Adverse reactions were defined as adverse events (in at least 0.5 percentage points of patients) 
which occurred at a higher rate (at least 2 percentage points) in patients receiving treatment with 
Lucentis 0.5 mg than in those receiving control treatment (sham or verteporfin PDT).

Product-class-related adverse reactions 
In the wet AMD phase III studies, the overall frequency of non-ocular haemorrhages, an adverse event 
potentially related to systemic VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibition, was slightly 
increased in ranibizumab-treated patients. However, there was no consistent pattern among the 
different haemorrhages. There is a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke 
and myocardial infarction, following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. A low incidence rate of 
arterial thromboembolic events was observed in the Lucentis clinical studies in patients with AMD, 
DME, PDR, RVO and CNV and there were no major differences between the groups treated with 
ranibizumab compared to control. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Cases of accidental overdose have been reported from the clinical studies in wet AMD and post-
marketing data. Adverse reactions associated with these reported cases were intraocular pressure 
increased, transient blindness, reduced visual acuity, corneal oedema, corneal pain, and eye pain. If an 
overdose occurs, intraocular pressure should be monitored and treated, if deemed necessary by the 
attending physician.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, antineovascularisation agents, ATC code: S01LA04 
Mechanism of action 
Ranibizumab is a humanised recombinant monoclonal antibody fragment targeted against human 
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It binds with high affinity to the VEGF-A isoforms 
(e.g. VEGF110, VEGF121 and VEGF165), thereby preventing binding of VEGF-A to its receptors 
VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. Binding of VEGF-A to its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation 
and neovascularisation, as well as vascular leakage, all of which are thought to contribute to the 
progression of the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia and CNV 
or to visual impairment caused by either diabetic macular oedema or macular oedema secondary to 
RVO.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Treatment of wet AMD 
In wet AMD, the clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis have been assessed in three randomised, 
double-masked, sham- or active-controlled studies of 24 months duration in patients with neovascular 
AMD. A total of 1,323 patients (879 active and 444 control) were enrolled in these studies. 
In study FVF2598g (MARINA), 716 patients with minimally classic or occult with no classic lesions 
were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive monthly injections of Lucentis 0.3 mg, Lucentis 0.5 mg or 
sham. 
In study FVF2587g (ANCHOR), 423 patients with predominantly classic CNV lesions were 
randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Lucentis 0.3 mg monthly, Lucentis 0.5 mg monthly or 
verteporfin PDT (at baseline and every 3 months thereafter if fluorescein angiography showed 
persistence or recurrence of vascular leakage). 
Key outcome measures are summarised in Table 1 and Figure 1.

Figure 1  Mean change in visual acuity from baseline to Month 24 in study FVF2598g 
(MARINA) and study FVF2587g (ANCHOR) 
Results from both studies indicated that continued ranibizumab treatment may also be of benefit in 
patients who lost ≥15 letters of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the first year of treatment. 
Statistically significant patient-reported visual functioning benefits were observed in both MARINA 
and ANCHOR with ranibizumab treatment over the control group as measured by the NEI VFQ-25. 
In study FVF3192g (PIER), 184 patients with all forms of neovascular AMD were randomised in a 
1:1:1 ratio to receive Lucentis 0.3 mg, Lucentis 0.5 mg or sham injections once a month for 
3 consecutive doses, followed by a dose administered once every 3 months. From Month 14 of the 
study, sham-treated patients were allowed to receive ranibizumab and from Month 19, more frequent 
treatments were possible. Patients treated with Lucentis in PIER received a mean of 10 total 
treatments. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After an initial increase in visual acuity (following monthly dosing), on average, patients’ visual acuity 
declined with quarterly dosing, returning to baseline at Month 12 and this effect was maintained in 
most ranibizumab-treated patients (82%) at Month 24. Limited data from sham subjects who later 
received ranibizumab suggested that early initiation of treatment may be associated with better 
preservation of visual acuity. 
Data from two studies (MONT BLANC, BPD952A2308 and DENALI, BPD952A2309) conducted 
post approval confirmed the efficacy of Lucentis but did not demonstrate additional effect of the 
combined administration of verteporfin (Visudyne PDT) and Lucentis compared to Lucentis 
monotherapy. 
Treatment of visual impairment due to CNV secondary to PM 
The clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis in patients with visual impairment due to CNV in PM have 
been assessed based on the 12-month data of the double-masked, controlled pivotal study F2301 
(RADIANCE). In this study 277 patients were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to the following arms: 
• 
Group I (ranibizumab 0.5 mg, dosing regimen driven by “stability” criteria defined as no change 
in BCVA compared to two preceding monthly evaluations). 
Group II (ranibizumab 0.5 mg, dosing regimen driven by “disease activity” criteria defined as 
vision impairment attributable to intra- or subretinal fluid or active leakage due to the CNV 
lesion as assessed by optical coherence tomography and/or fluorescence angiography). 
Group III (vPDT - patients were allowed to receive ranibizumab treatment as of Month 3). 
• 
In Group II, which is the recommended posology (see section 4.2), 50.9% of patients required 1 or 
2 injections, 34.5% required 3 to 5 injections and 14.7% required 6 to 12 injections over the 12-month 
study period. 62.9% of Group II patients did not require injections in the second 6 months of the study.

Figure 2  Mean change from baseline BCVA over time to Month 12 (RADIANCE) 
The improvement of vision was accompanied by a reduction in central retinal thickness. 
Patient-reported benefits were observed with ranibizumab treatment arms over vPDT (p-value <0.05) 
in terms of improvement in the composite score and several subscales (general vision, near activities, 
mental health and dependency) of the NEI VFQ-25. 
Treatment of visual impairment due to CNV (other than secondary to PM and wet AMD) 
The clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis in patients with visual impairment due to CNV have been 
assessed based on the 12-month data of the double-masked, sham-controlled pivotal study G2301 
(MINERVA). In this study 178 adult patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive: 
• 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg at baseline, followed by an individualised dosing regimen driven by disease 
activity as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters (e.g. visual acuity 
impairment, intra/sub-retinal fluid, haemorrhage or leakage); 
sham injection at baseline, followed by an individualised treatment regimen driven by disease 
activity. 
• 
At Month 2, all patients received open-label treatment with ranibizumab as needed. 
Key outcome measures from MINERVA are summarised in Table 3 and Figure 3. An improvement of 
vision was observed and was accompanied by a reduction in central subfield thickness over the 
12-month period. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean number of injections given over 12 months was 5.8 in the ranibizumab arm versus 5.4 in 
those patients in the sham arm who were eligible to receive ranibizumab from Month 2 onwards. In 
the sham arm 7 out of 59 patients did not receive any treatment with ranibizumab in the study eye 
during the 12-month period.

In the pivotal study G2301 (MINERVA), five adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years with visual 
impairment secondary to CNV received open-label treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg at baseline 
followed by an individualised treatment regimen as for the adult population. BCVA improved from 
baseline to Month 12 in all five patients, ranging from 5 to 38 letters (mean of 16.6 letters). The 
improvement of vision was accompanied by a stabilisation or reduction in central subfield thickness 
over the 12-month period. The mean number of ranibizumab injections given in the study eye over 
12 months was 3 (ranged from 2 to 5). Overall, ranibizumab treatment was well tolerated. 
Treatment of visual impairment due to DME 
The efficacy and safety of Lucentis have been assessed in three randomised, controlled studies of at 
least 12 months duration. A total of 868 patients (708 active and 160 control) were enrolled in these 
studies. 
In the phase II study D2201 (RESOLVE), 151 patients were treated with ranibizumab (6 mg/ml, n=51, 
10 mg/ml, n=51) or sham (n=49) by monthly intravitreal injections. The mean average change in 
BCVA from Month 1 to Month 12 compared to baseline was +7.8 (±7.72) letters in the pooled 
ranibizumab-treated patients (n=102), compared to -0.1 (±9.77) letters for sham-treated patients; and 
the mean change in BCVA at Month 12 from baseline was 10.3 (±9.1) letters compared to -1.4 (±14.2) 
letters, respectively (p<0.0001 for the treatment difference). 
In the phase III study D2301 (RESTORE), 345 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy and sham laser photocoagulation, combined ranibizumab 0.5 mg 
and laser photocoagulation or sham injection and laser photocoagulation. 240 patients, who had 
previously completed the 12-month RESTORE study, were enrolled in the open-label, multicentre 
24-month extension (RESTORE Extension) study. Patients were treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg pro 
re nata (PRN) in the same eye as the core study (D2301 RESTORE).

Statistically significant patient-reported benefits for most vision-related functions were observed with 
ranibizumab (with or without laser) treatment over the control group as measured by the NEI VFQ-25. 
For other subscales of this questionnaire no treatment differences could be established. 
The long-term safety profile of ranibizumab observed in the 24-month extension study is consistent 
with the known Lucentis safety profile. 
In the phase IIIb study D2304 (RETAIN), 372 patients were randomised in 1:1:1 ratio to receive: 
• 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg with concomitant laser photocoagulation on a treat-and-extend (TE) 
regimen, 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy on a TE regimen, 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy on a PRN regimen. 
• 
• 
In all groups, ranibizumab was administered monthly until BCVA was stable for at least three 
consecutive monthly assessments. On TE, ranibizumab was administered at treatment intervals of 
2-3 months. In all groups, monthly treatment was re-initiated upon a decrease in BCVA due to DME 
progression and continued until stable BCVA was reached again. 
The number of scheduled treatment visits after the initial 3 injections, was 13 and 20 for the TE and 
PRN regimens, respectively. With both TE regimens, more than 70% of patients maintained their 
BCVA with an average visit frequency of ≥2 months.

In DME studies, the improvement in BCVA was accompanied by a reduction over time in mean CSFT 
in all the treatment groups. 
Treatment of PDR 
The clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis in patients with PDR have been assessed in Protocol S 
which evaluated the treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections compared with 
panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). The primary endpoint was the mean visual acuity change at year 2. 
Additionally, change in diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity was assessed based on fundus photographs 
using the DR severity score (DRSS). 
Protocol S was a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, parallel-assignment, non-inferiority 
phase III study in which 305 patients (394 study eyes) with PDR with or without DME at baseline 
were enrolled. The study compared ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections to standard treatment 
with PRP. A total of 191 eyes (48.5%) were randomised to ranibizumab 0.5 mg and 203 eyes (51.5%) 
eyes were randomised to PRP. A total of 88 eyes (22.3%) had baseline DME: 42 (22.0%) and 
46 (22.7%) eyes in the ranibizumab and PRP groups, respectively. 
In this study, the mean visual acuity change at year 2 was +2.7 letters in the ranibizumab group 
compared to -0.7 letters in the PRP group. The difference in least square means was 3.5 letters (95% 
CI: [0.2 to 6.7]). 
At year 1, 41.8% of eyes experienced a ≥2-step improvement in the DRSS when treated with 
ranibizumab (n=189) compared to 14.6% of eyes treated with PRP (n=199). The estimated difference 
between ranibizumab and laser was 27.4% (95% CI: [18.9, 35.9]).

At year 1 in the ranibizumab-treated group in Protocol S, ≥2-step improvement in DRSS was 
consistent in eyes without DME (39.9%) and with baseline DME (48.8%). 
An analysis of year 2 data from Protocol S demonstrated that 42.3% (n=80) of eyes in the 
ranibizumab-treated group had ≥2-step improvement in DRSS from baseline compared with 23.1% 
(n=46) of eyes in the PRP group. In the ranibizumab-treated group, ≥2-step improvement in DRSS 
from baseline was observed in 58.5% (n=24) of eyes with baseline DME and 37.8% (n=56) of eyes 
without DME. 
DRSS was also assessed in three separate active-controlled phase III DME studies (ranibizumab 
0.5 mg PRN vs laser) that included a total of 875 patients, of whom approximately 75% were of Asian 
origin. In a meta-analysis of these studies, 48.4% of the 315 patients with gradable DRSS scores in the 
subgroup of patients with moderately severe non-proliferative DR (NPDR) or worse at baseline 
experienced a ≥2-step improvement in the DRSS at Month 12 when treated with ranibizumab (n=192) 
vs 14.6% of patients treated with laser (n=123). The estimated difference between ranibizumab and 
laser was 29.9% (95% CI: [20.0, 39.7]). In the 405 DRSS gradable patients with moderate NPDR or 
better, a ≥2-step DRSS improvement was observed in 1.4% and 0.9% of the ranibizumab and laser 
groups, respectively. 
Treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to RVO 
The clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis in patients with visual impairment due to macular oedema 
secondary to RVO have been assessed in the randomised, double-masked, controlled studies BRAVO 
and CRUISE that recruited subjects with BRVO (n=397) and CRVO (n=392), respectively. In both 
studies, subjects received either 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab or sham injections. After 6 months, 
patients in the sham-control arms switched to 0.5 mg ranibizumab.

Key outcome measures from BRAVO and CRUISE are summarised in Table 8 and Figures 5 and 6.

In both studies, the improvement of vision was accompanied by a continuous and significant reduction 
in the macular oedema as measured by central retinal thickness. 
In patients with CRVO (CRUISE and extension study HORIZON): Subjects treated with sham in the 
first 6 months who subsequently received ranibizumab did not achieve comparable gains in visual 
acuity by Month 24 (~6 letters) compared to subjects treated with ranibizumab from study start 
(~12 letters). 
Statistically significant patient-reported benefits in subscales related to near and distance activity were 
observed with ranibizumab treatment over the control group as measured by the NEI VFQ-25. 
The long-term (24 months) clinical safety and efficacy of Lucentis in patients with visual impairment 
due to macular oedema secondary to RVO were assessed in the BRIGHTER (BRVO) and CRYSTAL 
(CRVO) studies. In both studies, subjects received a 0.5 mg ranibizumab PRN dosing regimen driven 
by individualised stabilisation criteria. BRIGHTER was a 3-arm randomised active-controlled study 
that compared 0.5 mg ranibizumab given as monotherapy or in combination with adjunctive laser 
photocoagulation to laser photocoagulation alone. After 6 months, subjects in the laser arm could 
receive 0.5 mg ranibizumab. CRYSTAL was a single-arm study with 0.5 mg ranibizumab 
monotherapy.

In BRIGHTER, ranibizumab 0.5 mg with adjunctive laser therapy demonstrated non-inferiority versus 
ranibizumab monotherapy from baseline to Month 24 (95% CI -2.8, 1.4). 
In both studies, a rapid and statistically significant decrease from baseline in central retinal subfield 
thickness was observed at Month 1. This effect was maintained up to Month 24. 
The effect of ranibizumab treatment was similar irrespective of the presence of retinal ischaemia. In 
BRIGHTER, patients with ischaemia present (N=46) or absent (N=133) and treated with ranibizumab 
monotherapy had a mean change from baseline of +15.3 and +15.6 letters, respectively, at Month 24. 
In CRYSTAL, patients with ischaemia present (N=53) or absent (N=300) and treated with 
ranibizumab monotherapy had a mean change from baseline of +15.0 and +11.5 letters, respectively. 
The effect in terms of visual improvement was observed in all patients treated with 0.5 mg 
ranibizumab monotherapy regardless of their disease duration in both BRIGHTER and CRYSTAL. In 
patients with <3 months disease duration an increase in visual acuity of 13.3 and 10.0 letters was seen 
at Month 1; and 17.7 and 13.2 letters at Month 24 in BRIGHTER and CRYSTAL, respectively. The 
corresponding visual acuity gain in patients with ≥12 months disease duration was 8.6 and 8.4 letters 
in the respective studies. Treatment initiation at the time of diagnosis should be considered. 
The long-term safety profile of ranibizumab observed in the 24-month studies is consistent with the 
known Lucentis safety profile. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ranibizumab 0.5 mg in pre-filled syringe have not been studied in paediatric 
patients. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Lucentis in all subsets of the paediatric population in neovascular AMD, visual impairment due to 
DME, visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to RVO and visual impairment due to 
CNV and diabetic retinopathy (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following monthly intravitreal administration of Lucentis to patients with neovascular AMD, serum 
concentrations of ranibizumab were generally low, with maximum levels (Cmax) generally below the 
ranibizumab concentration necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF by 50% (11-27 ng/ml, 
as assessed in an in vitro cellular proliferation assay). Cmax was dose proportional over the dose range 
of 0.05 to 1.0 mg/eye. Serum concentrations in a limited number of DME patients indicate that a 
slightly higher systemic exposure cannot be excluded compared to those observed in neovascular 
AMD patients. Serum ranibizumab concentrations in RVO patients were similar or slightly higher 
compared to those observed in neovascular AMD patients. 
Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics and disappearance of ranibizumab from serum for 
patients with neovascular AMD treated with the 0.5 mg dose, the average vitreous elimination half-life 
of ranibizumab is approximately 9 days. Upon monthly intravitreal administration of Lucentis 
0.5 mg/eye, serum ranibizumab Cmax, attained approximately 1 day after dosing, is predicted to 
generally range between 0.79 and 2.90 ng/ml, and Cmin is predicted to generally range between 0.07 
and 0.49 ng/ml. Serum ranibizumab concentrations are predicted to be approximately 90,000-fold 
lower than vitreal ranibizumab concentrations. 
Patients with renal impairment: No formal studies have been conducted to examine the 
pharmacokinetics of Lucentis in patients with renal impairment. In a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis of neovascular AMD patients, 68% (136 of 200) of patients had renal impairment (46.5% 
mild [50-80 ml/min], 20% moderate [30-50 ml/min], and 1.5% severe [<30 ml/min]). In RVO 
patients, 48.2% (253 of 525) had renal impairment (36.4% mild, 9.5% moderate and 2.3% severe). 
Systemic clearance was slightly lower, but this was not clinically significant. 
Hepatic impairment: No formal studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of 
Lucentis in patients with hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Bilateral intravitreal administration of ranibizumab to cynomolgus monkeys at doses between 
0.25 mg/eye and 2.0 mg/eye once every 2 weeks for up to 26 weeks resulted in dose-dependent ocular 
effects. 
Intraocularly, there were dose-dependent increases in anterior chamber flare and cells with a peak 
2 days after injection. The severity of the inflammatory response generally diminished with 
subsequent injections or during recovery. In the posterior segment, there were vitreal cell infiltration 
and floaters, which also tended to be dose-dependent and generally persisted to the end of the 
treatment period. In the 26-week study, the severity of the vitreous inflammation increased with the 
number of injections. However, evidence of reversibility was observed after recovery. The nature and 
timing of the posterior segment inflammation is suggestive of an immune-mediated antibody response, 
which may be clinically irrelevant. Cataract formation was observed in some animals after a relatively 
long period of intense inflammation, suggesting that the lens changes were secondary to severe 
inflammation. A transient increase in post-dose intraocular pressure was observed following 
intravitreal injections, irrespective of dose. 
Microscopic ocular changes were related to inflammation and did not indicate degenerative processes. 
Granulomatous inflammatory changes were noted in the optic disc of some eyes. These posterior 
segment changes diminished, and in some instances resolved, during the recovery period. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following intravitreal administration, no signs of systemic toxicity were detected. Serum and vitreous 
antibodies to ranibizumab were found in a subset of treated animals. 
No carcinogenicity or mutagenicity data are available. 
In pregnant monkeys, intravitreal ranibizumab treatment resulting in maximal systemic exposures 
0.9-7-fold a worst case clinical exposure did not elicit developmental toxicity or teratogenicity, and 
had no effect on weight or structure of the placenta, although, based on its pharmacological effect 
ranibizumab should be regarded as potentially teratogenic and embryo-/foetotoxic. 
The absence of ranibizumab-mediated effects on embryo-foetal development is plausibly related 
mainly to the inability of the Fab fragment to cross the placenta. Nevertheless, a case was described 
with high maternal ranibizumab serum levels and presence of ranibizumab in foetal serum, suggesting 
that the anti-ranibizumab antibody acted as (Fc region containing) carrier protein for ranibizumab, 
thereby decreasing its maternal serum clearance and enabling its placental transfer. As the embryo-
foetal development investigations were performed in healthy pregnant animals and disease (such as 
diabetes) may modify the permeability of the placenta towards a Fab fragment, the study should be 
interpreted with caution.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
The pre-filled syringe is for single use only. The pre-filled syringe is sterile. Do not use the product if 
the packaging is damaged. The sterility of the pre-filled syringe cannot be guaranteed unless the tray 
remains sealed. Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the solution is discoloured, cloudy or contains 
particles. 
The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 0.5 mg. The extractable volume of 
the pre-filled syringe (0.1 ml) is not to be used in total. The excess volume should be expelled prior to 
injection. Injecting the entire volume of the pre-filled syringe could result in overdose. To expel the air 
bubble along with the excess medicinal product, slowly push the plunger until the edge below the 
dome of the rubber stopper is aligned with the black dosing line on the syringe (equivalent to 0.05 ml, 
i.e., 0.5 mg ranibizumab). 
For the intravitreal injection, a 30G x ½″ sterile injection needle should be used. 
To prepare Lucentis for intravitreal administration, please adhere to the instructions for use:

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lucentis is and what it is used for 
What Lucentis is 
Lucentis is a solution which is injected into the eye. Lucentis belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents. It contains the active substance called ranibizumab. 
What Lucentis is used for 
Lucentis is used in adults to treat several eye diseases causing vision impairment. 
These diseases result from damage to the retina (light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) caused by: 
Growth of leaky, abnormal blood vessels. This is observed in diseases such as age-related 
- 
macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR, a disease caused by 
diabetes). It may also be associated with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) due to pathologic 
myopia (PM), angioid streaks, central serous chorioretinopathy or inflammatory CNV. 
Macular oedema (swelling of the centre of the retina). This swelling can be caused by diabetes 
(a disease called diabetic macular oedema (DME)) or by the blockage of retinal veins of the 
retina (a disease called retinal vein occlusion (RVO)). 
- 
How Lucentis works 
Lucentis specifically recognises and binds to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth 
factor A (VEGF-A) present in the eye. In excess, VEGF-A causes abnormal blood vessel growth and 
swelling in the eye which can lead to impairment of vision in diseases like AMD, DME, PDR, RVO, 
PM and CNV. By binding to VEGF-A, Lucentis can block its actions and prevent this abnormal 
growth and swelling. 
In these diseases, Lucentis can help to stabilise and in many cases improve your vision.

2.  What you need to know before you are given Lucentis 
You must not receive Lucentis 
- 
If you are allergic to ranibizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you have an infection in or around your eye. 
If you have pain or redness (severe intraocular inflammation) in your eye. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Lucentis. 
- 
Lucentis is given as an injection into the eye. Occasionally, an infection in the internal portion 
of the eye, pain or redness (inflammation), detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of 
the eye (retinal detachment or tear and retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), or 
clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur after Lucentis treatment. It is important to identify and 
treat such an infection or retinal detachment as soon as possible. Please tell your doctor 
immediately if you develop signs such as eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye 
redness, blurred or decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in your vision or 
increased sensitivity to light. 
In some patients the eye pressure may increase for a short period directly after the injection. 
This is something you may not notice, therefore your doctor may monitor this after each 
injection. 
Inform your doctor if you have a prior history of eye conditions or eye treatments, or if you 
have had a stroke or experienced transient signs of stroke (weakness or paralysis of limbs or 
face, difficulty speaking or understanding). This information will be taken into account to 
evaluate if Lucentis is the appropriate treatment for you. 
Please see section 4 (“Possible side effects”) for more detailed information on side effects that could 
occur during Lucentis therapy. 
Children and adolescents (below 18 years of age) 
Except for retinopathy of prematurity, the use of Lucentis in children and adolescents has not been 
established and is therefore not recommended. For the treatment of babies born prematurely with 
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) please see the other side of this leaflet. 
Other medicines and Lucentis 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- 
Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment and for 
at least three further months after the last injection of Lucentis. 
There is no experience of using Lucentis in pregnant women. Lucentis should not be used 
during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If 
you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with 
your doctor before treatment with Lucentis. 
Small amounts of Lucentis may pass into breast milk, therefore Lucentis is not recommended 
during breast-feeding. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before Lucentis treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
After Lucentis treatment you may experience some temporary vision blurring. If this happens, do not 
drive or use machines until this resolves. 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How Lucentis is given 
Lucentis is administered as a single injection into your eye by your eye doctor under a local 
anaesthetic. The usual dose of an injection is 0.05 ml (which contains 0.5 mg of active substance). The 
interval between two doses injected into the same eye should be at least four weeks. All injections will 
be administered by your eye doctor. 
Before the injection, your doctor will wash your eye carefully to prevent infection. Your doctor will 
also give you a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain you might have with the injection. 
The treatment is started with one injection of Lucentis per month. Your doctor will monitor the 
condition of your eye and, depending on how you respond to the treatment, will decide if and when 
you need to receive further treatment. 
Detailed instructions for use are given at the end of the leaflet under “How to prepare and administer 
Lucentis to adults”. 
Elderly (age 65 years and over) 
Lucentis can be used for people of 65 years of age and over without dose adjustment. 
Before stopping Lucentis treatment 
If you are considering stopping Lucentis treatment, please go to your next appointment and discuss 
this with your doctor. Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with 
Lucentis. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR HEALTHCARE 
PROFESSIONALS ONLY: 
Please also refer to section 3 “How Lucentis is given”. 
How to prepare and administer Lucentis to adults 
Single-use vial for intravitreal use only 
Lucentis must be administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections. 
In wet AMD, in CNV, in PDR and in visual impairment due to DME or to macular oedema secondary 
to RVO the recommended dose for Lucentis is 0.5 mg given as a single intravitreal injection. This 
corresponds to an injection volume of 0.05 ml. The interval between two doses injected into the same 
eye should be at least four weeks. 
Treatment is initiated with one injection per month until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or 
there are no signs of disease activity i.e. no change in visual acuity and in other signs and symptoms of 
the disease under continued treatment. In patients with wet AMD, DME, PDR and RVO, initially, 
three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed. 
Thereafter, monitoring and treatment intervals should be determined by the physician and should be 
based on disease activity, as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters. 
If, in the physician’s opinion, visual and anatomical parameters indicate that the patient is not 
benefiting from continued treatment, Lucentis should be discontinued. 
Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging 
techniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography). 
If patients are being treated according to a treat-and-extend regimen, once maximum visual acuity is 
achieved and/or there are no signs of disease activity, the treatment intervals can be extended stepwise 
until signs of disease activity or visual impairment recur. The treatment interval should be extended by 
no more than two weeks at a time for wet AMD and may be extended by up to one month at a time for 
DME. For PDR and RVO, treatment intervals may also be gradually extended, however there are 
insufficient data to conclude on the length of these intervals. If disease activity recurs, the treatment 
interval should be shortened accordingly. 
The treatment of visual impairment due to CNV should be determined individually per patient based 
on disease activity. Some patients may only need one injection during the first 12 months; others may 
need more frequent treatment, including a monthly injection. For CNV secondary to pathologic 
myopia (PM), many patients may only need one or two injections during the first year. 
Lucentis and laser photocoagulation in DME and macular oedema secondary to BRVO 
There is some experience of Lucentis administered concomitantly with laser photocoagulation. When 
given on the same day, Lucentis should be administered at least 30 minutes after laser 
photocoagulation. Lucentis can be administered in patients who have received previous laser 
photocoagulation. 
Lucentis and verteporfin photodynamic therapy in CNV secondary to PM 
There is no experience of concomitant administration of Lucentis and verteporfin. 
Lucentis should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the use of 
surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) 
and the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). The patient’s medical history for 
hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to performing the intravitreal procedure. 
Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the periocular skin, eyelid 
and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection, in accordance with local practice. 
Vial-only pack 
The vial is for single use only. After injection any unused product must be discarded. Any vial 
showing signs of damage or tampering must not be used. The sterility cannot be guaranteed unless the 
packaging seal remains intact. 
For preparation and intravitreal injection the following medical devices for single use are needed: 
- 
- 
- 
These medical devices are not included within the Lucentis pack. 
a 5 µm filter needle (18G) 
a 1 ml sterile syringe (including a 0.05 ml mark) 
an injection needle (30G x ½″). 
Vial + filter needle pack 
All components are sterile and for single use only. Any component with packaging showing signs of 
damage or tampering must not be used. The sterility cannot be guaranteed unless the component 
packaging seal remains intact. Re-use may lead to infection or other illness/injury. 
For preparation and intravitreal injection the following medical devices for single use are needed: 
- 
- 
- 
a 5 µm filter needle (18G x 1½″, 1.2 mm x 40 mm, provided) 
a 1 ml sterile syringe (including a 0.05 ml mark, not included within the Lucentis pack) 
an injection needle (30G x ½″; not included within the Lucentis pack) 
To prepare Lucentis for intravitreal administration to adult patients, please adhere to the following 
instructions: 
1. Before withdrawal, remove the vial cap and clean the vial 
septum (e.g. with 70% alcohol swab). 
2. Assemble a 5 µm filter needle (18G x 1½″, 
1.2 mm x 40 mm, 5 µm) onto a 1 ml syringe using aseptic 
technique. Push the blunt filter needle into the centre of the 
vial stopper until the needle touches the bottom edge of the 
vial. 
3. Withdraw all the liquid from the vial, keeping the vial in 
an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete 
withdrawal. 
4. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back 
when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the 
filter needle. 
5. Leave the blunt filter needle in the vial and disconnect 
the syringe from the blunt filter needle. The filter needle 
should be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents 
and should not be used for the intravitreal injection. 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. Aseptically and firmly assemble an injection needle 
(30G x ½″, 0.3 mm x 13 mm) onto the syringe. 
7. Carefully remove the cap from the injection needle 
without disconnecting the injection needle from the syringe. 
Note: Grip at the hub of the injection needle while 
removing the cap. 
8. Carefully expel the air along with the excess solution 
from the syringe and adjust the dose to the 0.05 ml mark on 
the syringe. The syringe is ready for injection. 
Note: Do not wipe the injection needle. Do not pull back on 
the plunger. 
0.05 ml 
The injection needle should be inserted 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous cavity, 
avoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection volume of 
0.05 ml is then delivered; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections. 
After injection, do not recap the needle or detach it from the syringe. Dispose of the used syringe 
together with the needle in a sharps disposal container or in accordance with local requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lucentis is and what it is used for 
What Lucentis is 
Lucentis is a solution which is injected into the eye. Lucentis belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents. It contains the active substance called ranibizumab. 
What Lucentis is used for 
Lucentis is used in adults to treat several eye diseases causing vision impairment. 
These diseases result from damage to the retina (light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) caused by: 
Growth of leaky, abnormal blood vessels. This is observed in diseases such as age-related 
- 
macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR, a disease caused by 
diabetes). It may also be associated with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) due to pathologic 
myopia (PM), angioid streaks, central serous chorioretinopathy or inflammatory CNV. 
Macular oedema (swelling of the centre of the retina). This swelling can be caused by diabetes 
(a disease called diabetic macular oedema (DME)) or by the blockage of retinal veins of the 
retina (a disease called retinal vein occlusion (RVO)). 
- 
How Lucentis works 
Lucentis specifically recognises and binds to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth 
factor A (VEGF-A) present in the eye. In excess, VEGF-A causes abnormal blood vessel growth and 
swelling in the eye which can lead to impairment of vision in diseases like AMD, DME, PDR, RVO, 
PM and CNV. By binding to VEGF-A, Lucentis can block its actions and prevent this abnormal 
growth and swelling. 
In these diseases, Lucentis can help to stabilise and in many cases improve your vision.

2.  What you need to know before you are given Lucentis 
You must not receive Lucentis 
- 
If you are allergic to ranibizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you have an infection in or around your eye. 
If you have pain or redness (severe intraocular inflammation) in your eye. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Lucentis. 
- 
Lucentis is given as an injection into the eye. Occasionally, an infection in the internal portion 
of the eye, pain or redness (inflammation), detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of 
the eye (retinal detachment or tear and retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), or 
clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur after Lucentis treatment. It is important to identify and 
treat such an infection or retinal detachment as soon as possible. Please tell your doctor 
immediately if you develop signs such as eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye 
redness, blurred or decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in your vision or 
increased sensitivity to light. 
In some patients the eye pressure may increase for a short period directly after the injection. 
This is something you may not notice, therefore your doctor may monitor this after each 
injection. 
Inform your doctor if you have a prior history of eye conditions or eye treatments, or if you 
have had a stroke or experienced transient signs of stroke (weakness or paralysis of limbs or 
face, difficulty speaking or understanding). This information will be taken into account to 
evaluate if Lucentis is the appropriate treatment for you. 
Please see section 4 (“Possible side effects”) for more detailed information on side effects that could 
occur during Lucentis therapy. 
Children and adolescents (below 18 years of age) 
The use of Lucentis in children and adolescents has not been established and is therefore not 
recommended. 
Other medicines and Lucentis 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- 
Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment and for 
at least three further months after the last injection of Lucentis. 
There is no experience of using Lucentis in pregnant women. Lucentis should not be used 
during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If 
you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with 
your doctor before treatment with Lucentis. 
Small amounts of Lucentis may pass into breast milk, therefore Lucentis is not recommended 
during breast-feeding. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before Lucentis treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
After Lucentis treatment you may experience some temporary vision blurring. If this happens, do not 
drive or use machines until this resolves. 
82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How Lucentis is given 
Lucentis is administered as a single injection into your eye by your eye doctor under a local 
anaesthetic. The usual dose of an injection is 0.05 ml (which contains 0.5 mg of active substance). The 
pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 0.5 mg. The extractable volume is not 
to be used in total. The excess volume should be expelled prior to injection. Injecting the entire 
volume of the pre-filled syringe could result in overdose. 
The interval between two doses injected into the same eye should be at least four weeks. All injections 
will be administered by your eye doctor. 
Before the injection, your doctor will wash your eye carefully to prevent infection. Your doctor will 
also give you a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain you might have with the injection. 
The treatment is started with one injection of Lucentis per month. Your doctor will monitor the 
condition of your eye and, depending on how you respond to the treatment, will decide if and when 
you need to receive further treatment. 
Detailed instructions for use are given at the end of the leaflet under “How to prepare and administer 
Lucentis”. 
Elderly (age 65 years and over) 
Lucentis can be used for people of 65 years of age and over without dose adjustment. 
Before stopping Lucentis treatment 
If you are considering stopping Lucentis treatment, please go to your next appointment and discuss 
this with your doctor. Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with 
Lucentis. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Please also refer to section 3 “How Lucentis is given”. 
How to prepare and administer Lucentis 
Single-use pre-filled syringe for intravitreal use only 
Lucentis must be administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections. 
In wet AMD, in CNV, in PDR and in visual impairment due to DME or to macular oedema secondary 
to RVO the recommended dose for Lucentis is 0.5 mg given as a single intravitreal injection. This 
corresponds to an injection volume of 0.05 ml. The interval between two doses injected into the same 
eye should be at least four weeks. 
Treatment is initiated with one injection per month until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or 
there are no signs of disease activity i.e. no change in visual acuity and in other signs and symptoms of 
the disease under continued treatment. In patients with wet AMD, DME, PDR and RVO, initially, 
three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed. 
Thereafter, monitoring and treatment intervals should be determined by the physician and should be 
based on disease activity, as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters. 
If, in the physician’s opinion, visual and anatomical parameters indicate that the patient is not 
benefiting from continued treatment, Lucentis should be discontinued. 
Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging 
techniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography). 
If patients are being treated according to a treat-and-extend regimen, once maximum visual acuity is 
achieved and/or there are no signs of disease activity, the treatment intervals can be extended stepwise 
until signs of disease activity or visual impairment recur. The treatment interval should be extended by 
no more than two weeks at a time for wet AMD and may be extended by up to one month at a time for 
DME. For PDR and RVO, treatment intervals may also be gradually extended, however there are 
insufficient data to conclude on the length of these intervals. If disease activity recurs, the treatment 
interval should be shortened accordingly. 
The treatment of visual impairment due to CNV should be determined individually per patient based 
on disease activity. Some patients may only need one injection during the first 12 months; others may 
need more frequent treatment, including a monthly injection. For CNV secondary to pathologic 
myopia (PM), many patients may only need one or two injections during the first year. 
Lucentis and laser photocoagulation in DME and macular oedema secondary to BRVO 
There is some experience of Lucentis administered concomitantly with laser photocoagulation. When 
given on the same day, Lucentis should be administered at least 30 minutes after laser 
photocoagulation. Lucentis can be administered in patients who have received previous laser 
photocoagulation. 
Lucentis and verteporfin photodynamic therapy in CNV secondary to PM 
There is no experience of concomitant administration of Lucentis and verteporfin. 
Lucentis should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the use of 
surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) 
and the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). The patient’s medical history for 
hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to performing the intravitreal procedure. 
Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the periocular skin, eyelid 
and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection, in accordance with local practice. 
The pre-filled syringe is for single use only. The pre-filled syringe is sterile. Do not use the product if 
the packaging is damaged. The sterility of the pre-filled syringe cannot be guaranteed unless the tray 
remains sealed. Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the solution is discoloured, cloudy or contains 
particles. 
The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 0.5 mg. The extractable volume of 
the pre-filled syringe (0.1 ml) is not to be used in total. The excess volume should be expelled prior to 
injection. Injecting the entire volume of the pre-filled syringe could result in overdose. To expel the air 
bubble along with the excess medicinal product, slowly push the plunger until the edge below the 
dome of the rubber stopper is aligned with the black dosing line on the syringe (equivalent to 0.05 ml, 
i.e., 0.5 mg ranibizumab). 
For the intravitreal injection, a 30G x ½″ sterile injection needle should be used. 
To prepare Lucentis for intravitreal administration, please adhere to the instructions for use:

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lucentis is and what it is used for 
What Lucentis is 
Lucentis is a solution which is injected into the eye. Lucentis belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents. It contains the active substance called ranibizumab. 
What Lucentis is used for 
Lucentis is used in babies born prematurely to treat retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a disease 
causing vision impairment due to damage to the back of the eye (the retina) caused by abnormal 
growth of blood vessels. 
How Lucentis works 
Lucentis specifically recognises and binds to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth 
factor A (VEGF-A) present in the eye. In excess, VEGF-A causes abnormal blood vessel growth in the 
eye. Lucentis can block its actions and prevent this abnormal growth. 
2.  What you need to know before your baby is given Lucentis 
Your baby must not receive Lucentis 
- 
If your baby is allergic to ranibizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If your baby has an infection in or around the eye. 
If your baby has pain or redness (severe intraocular inflammation) in the eye.

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your baby’s doctor before your baby is given Lucentis. 
- 
Lucentis is given as an injection into the eye. Occasionally, an infection in the internal portion 
of the eye, pain or redness (inflammation), detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of 
the eye (retinal detachment or tear and retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), or 
clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur after Lucentis treatment. It is important to identify and 
treat such an infection or retinal detachment as soon as possible. Please tell the doctor 
immediately if your baby develops signs such as eye pain or worsening eye redness. 
In some patients the eye pressure may increase for a short period directly after the injection. 
Your baby’s doctor may monitor this after each injection. 
- 
Please see section 4 (“Possible side effects”) for more detailed information on side effects that could 
occur during Lucentis therapy. 
Other medicines and Lucentis 
Tell your baby’s doctor if your baby is receiving, has recently received or might receive any other 
medicines. 
3. 
How Lucentis is given 
Lucentis will be administered by an eye doctor as a single injection into your baby’s eyes, usually 
under local anaesthetic. The usual dose of an injection is 0.02 ml (which contains 0.2 mg of active 
substance). The interval between two doses injected into the same eye should be at least four weeks. 
All injections will be administered by the eye doctor. 
Before the injection, your baby’s doctor will wash your baby’s eyes carefully to prevent infection. The 
doctor will also give your baby a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain. 
The treatment is started with one injection of Lucentis in each eye (some babies may only need 
treatment in one eye). The doctor will monitor the condition of your baby’s eye(s) and, depending on 
how your baby responds to the treatment, will decide if and when further treatment is needed. 
Detailed instructions for use are given at the end of the leaflet under “How to prepare and administer 
Lucentis to preterm infants”. 
Before stopping Lucentis treatment 
If you are considering stopping Lucentis treatment for your baby, please go to your next appointment 
and discuss this with your baby’s doctor. Your baby’s doctor will advise you and decide how long 
your baby should be treated with Lucentis. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your baby’s doctor.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR HEALTHCARE 
PROFESSIONALS ONLY: 
Please also refer to section 3 “How Lucentis is given”. 
How to prepare and administer Lucentis to preterm infants 
Single-use vial for intravitreal use only. 
Lucentis must be administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections in 
preterm infants. 
For treatment of preterm infants use the low volume high accuracy syringe provided together 
with an injection needle (30G x ½″) in the VISISURE kit. 
For preterm infants the recommended dose for Lucentis is 0.2 mg given as a single intravitreal 
injection. This corresponds to an injection volume of 0.02 ml. In preterm infants treatment of 
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is initiated with a single injection per eye and may be given 
bilaterally on the same day. In total up to three injections per eye may be administered within six 
months of treatment initiation if there are signs of disease activity. Most patients (78%) in the 24-week 
RAINBOW clinical study received one injection per eye. Patients who were treated with 0.2 mg in this 
clinical study did not require additional treatment in the subsequent long-term extension study which 
followed the patients up to five years of age. The administration of more than three injections per eye 
has not been studied. The interval between two doses injected into the same eye should be at least four 
weeks. 
Lucentis should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
The injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the use of 
surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) 
and the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). The patient’s medical history for 
hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to performing the intravitreal procedure. 
Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the periocular skin, eyelid 
and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection, in accordance with local practice. 
Vial-only pack 
The vial is for single use only. After injection any unused product must be discarded. Any vial 
showing signs of damage or tampering must not be used. The sterility cannot be guaranteed unless the 
packaging seal remains intact. 
For preparation and intravitreal injection the following medical devices for single use are needed: 
- 
- 
- 
a 5 µm filter needle (18G); not included within the Lucentis pack 
a low volume high accuracy sterile syringe (supplied separately inside the VISISURE kit) 
an injection needle (30G x ½″); (supplied separately inside the VISISURE kit) 
Vial + filter needle pack 
All components are sterile and for single use only. Any component with packaging showing signs of 
damage or tampering must not be used. The sterility cannot be guaranteed unless the component 
packaging seal remains intact. Re-use may lead to infection or other illness/injury. 
For preparation and intravitreal injection the following medical devices for single use are needed: 
- 
- 
- 
a 5 µm filter needle (18G x 1½″, 1.2 mm x 40 mm, provided) 
a low volume high accuracy sterile syringe (supplied separately inside the VISISURE kit) 
an injection needle (30G x ½″) (supplied separately inside the VISISURE kit) 
97 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To prepare Lucentis for intravitreal administration to preterm infants please adhere to the instructions 
for use in the VISISURE kit. 
The injection needle should be inserted into the eye 1.0 to 2.0 mm posterior to the limbus, with the 
needle pointing towards the optic nerve. The injection volume of 0.02 ml is then delivered.

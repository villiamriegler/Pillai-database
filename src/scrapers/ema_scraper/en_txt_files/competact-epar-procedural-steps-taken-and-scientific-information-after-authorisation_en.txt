C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
investigate a potential association between pioglitazone use 
and prostate cancer, using the CPRD GOLD database. The 
study was specifically designed to evaluate the risk of 
prostate cancer with use of pioglitazone in male patients 
with T2DM.Additionally, data on the incidence of 
adjudicated prostate cancer in patients receiving 
pioglitazone in the long-term Insulin Resistance 
Intervention after Stroke (IRIS) trial (IRIS Report) have 
also been provided. 
The results of this study did not show a statistically 
significant association between pioglitazone and prostate 
cancer. The MAH provided available histological data on 
Page 7/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cases of prostate cancer. Though the available data is very 
limited, the results of the histological data from all sources 
available to the MAH (Safety database, Pioglitazone_5018, 
PROactive Extension study and IRIS study) suggest that 
the majority of prostate cancers are prostatic 
adenocarcinomas in keeping with the common histological 
type seen in prostate cancer. Though the available data is 
very limited, there remain uncertainties in relation to any 
causal association between prostate cancer and 
pioglitazone therapy. The Marketing Authorisation Holder 
will continue to closely monitor this issue and will report 
should relevant data emerge.

Please refer to the assessment report:  
726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
25 January 2016 the opinion of the European 
Medicines Agency on the adequacy of the current 
recommendations for metformin containing products 
with respect to the use in patients with moderate 
renal failure, taking into account the available 
information on the risk of lactic acidosis. The CHMP 
was requested to assess the impact thereof on the 
benefit-risk balance of metformin containing 
products and to give its recommendation whether 
the marketing authorisation of this product should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
The notification for the procedure is appended to this 
opinion.

and urticaria. The frequency of these adverse reactions is

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of the available information, the CHMP 
II, Labelling 
is of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy 
and PL 
of Competact continues to be adequately and sufficiently 
demonstrated and therefore considers that the benefit/risk 
profile of this medicinal product continues to be favourable 
but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
The use of pioglitazone/metformin is associated with a 
number of identified adverse events (cardiac failure, weight 
gain, macular oedema, lactic acidosis, hypoglycaemia and 
bone fractures) as well as potential risks (hepatic events, 
carcinogenicity in particular bladder cancer, 
rhabdomyolysis, anaphylactoid reactions, blood disorders, 
cerebrovascular ischaemia, cardiac ischaemia) to be closely 
monitored and to be reported in 6 monthly PSURs and 
included in the Risk Management Plan. 
Further data and results from several studies are expected 
to further evaluate the risk of bladder cancer. Also study 
Page 19/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data are awaited to provide further answers on the risk of 
bone fractures.  
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Competact, 
which requires the submission of 6 monthly PSURs, the 
CHMP concluded that the MAH should, on the basis of 
pharmacovigilance grounds, submit one additional renewal 
application in 5 years time. 
During the renewal procedure, changes were made to the 
Product Information to bring it in line with the current 
EMEA/QRD template, SmPC guideline and other relevant 
guidelines, which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by 
the CHMP. In addition, the list of local representatives in 
the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representatives of Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, 
Norway and Sweden. Annex II has been amended to reflect 
the need for 6 monthly PSUR submissions.

regulatory authorities, 2 year bioassays in the rat and 
mouse determined pioglitazone treatment to be associated 
with urinary bladder tumours in the male rat. Pioglitazone 
and its major metabolites were not genotoxic, as 
established in a comprehensive battery of genotoxicity 
assays. Through re-examination of retained bladder 
specimens in fixative, calculi were found in the bladder and 
it was hypothesized that urinary calculi formation with 
subsequent irritation, hyperplasia and metaplasia may be 
responsible for the carcinogenic responses observed in 
male rats. It was concluded that the administration of

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
pioglitazone may be directly responsible for an increased 
incidence of hyperplastic changes in the bladder of the rat.  
The presence of microcrystals exacerbates the hyperplastic 
response but is not considered to be the cause of the 
hyperplastic changes. 
Updated part of Section 5.3 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristic: 
Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a 
comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity 
assays. An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and 
females) and tumours (males) of the urinary bladder 
epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone 
for up to 2 years.  
The formation and presence of urinary calculi with 
subsequent irritation and hyperplasia was postulated as the 
mechanistic basis for the observed tumourigenic response 
in the male rat. A 24-month mechanistic study in male rats 
demonstrated that administration of pioglitazone resulted 
in an increased incidence of hyperplastic changes in the 
bladder. Dietary acidification significantly decreased but did 
not abolish the incidence of tumours. The presence of 
microcrystals, although exacerbating the hyperplastic 
response is not considered to be the primary cause of the 
hyperplastic changes. The relevance to humans of the 
tumourigenic findings in the male rat cannot be excluded.

mg/metformin 850 mg BID (N=201), pioglitazone 15 mg 
BID (N=189), and metformin 850 mg BID (N=210) were 
evaluated in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with mean 
baseline HbA1C of 9.5% in a randomised double-blind,

discontinued for 12 weeks prior to baseline measurements. 
After 24 weeks of treatment, the primary endpoint of mean 
change from baseline in HbA1c was -1.83% in the 
combination group versus -0.96% in the pioglitazone group 
(p<0.0001) and -0.99% in the metformin group

Additionally, Annex II was updated to reflect the

with insulin, primarily as a result of clinical trial data from 
the completion of a large macrovascular outcome study of 
pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
known as 'PROactive' (protocol reference AD-4833/EC444), 
performed following a commitment made to the CPMP in 
June 2000.  
The MAH also submitted, as part of the present variation 
application, data from three efficacy and safety studies of 
pioglitazone used in combination with insulin. 
The main concern of the CHMP was the fact that both 
insulin and pioglitazone alone are associated with fluid 
retention and heart failure. However, it appears that 
combination therapy with pioglitazone and insulin is 
associated with an increased risk of heart failure, but not 
Page 24/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an increase in mortality, in particular from the sequelae of 
heart failure. The degree of heart failure would most likely 
be mild, and could be monitored symptomatically or by 
weight gain. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the 
exposure data presented was adequate to support the 
deletion of the contraindication with insulin, provided that 
the risk of heart failure is reflected in detail in the product 
information and in the Risk Management Plan. 
Section 4.3 of the Summary of Products Characteristics was 
updated to remove the contraindication for the use of 
pioglitazone in combination with insulin. Sections 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.1 were consequently updated to add information on 
the risk of heart failure. The relevant sections of the

(pioglitazone), the MAH committed to perform a large 
macrovascular outcome study of pioglitazone in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The MAH submitted the 
results of this macrovascular outcome study (PROactive 
study). 
The PROactive study failed regarding it's pre-specified 
primary endpoint, and any benefit suggested by the 
secondary endpoint suggests an effect in a type 2 diabetic 
population with extensive disease and being treated 
concurrently with multiple anti-diabetic and cardiovascular 
medicines, and treated with 45mg of pioglitazone. As would 
be expected, there were increases in weight in the 
pioglitazone group, and an increase in hypoglycaemia 
corresponding with better control of diabetes. There was 
also an increase in cardiac failure in the pioglitazone group. 
Page 25/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although these were no new safety issues, the previous 
safety concerns relating to weigh gain, oedema and heart 
failure were confirmed. 
Although the PROactive study suggested that 
administration of pioglitazone was not associated with an 
increased cardiovascular risk, the study failed to document 
a clear benefit, and the safety concerns mentioned above 
remain, particularly in the context of the new indication of 
pioglitazone in combination with insulin. 
The CHMP agreed that some information on the PROactive 
study, which was a significant and well-conducted study, 
could be introduced in section 5.1 of the Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

incidence of fractures among female patients with type 2 
diabetes taking a TZD, the CHMP was of the view that this 
issue should be further investigated and requested the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to provide 
information on all cases of fractures in patients taking 
pioglitazone, as well as an overview of all clinical and non-
clinical studies with glitazones in which bone metabolism 
was investigated or in which an effect on bone has been 
reported. 
Upon evaluation of the data provided by the MAH, the 
CHMP was of the view that there are theoretical reasons 
why thiazolidinediones could be associated with increased 
risk of fracture. Severity and duration of diabetes are risks 
factors for osteoporosis, and it is difficult to draw 
Page 26/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conclusions from the post-marketing data as fractures not 
surprisingly occur in older female patients. However, 
considering the clinical trial database, there appears to be a 
small but definite increased risk of fracture in the female 
patients treated with pioglitazone and analyses of the 
pooled data from controlled, double-blind, randomised, 
comparative clinical studies suggest a relative increase in 
fracture risk with time. 
Based on the available data, the CHMP requested the MAH 
to update the product information for Actos to reflect the 
risk of bone fractures. Sections "Special warnings and 
precautions for use" and "Undesirable effects" of the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) were updated 
with the available data from clinical trials regarding bone 
fractures and with a warning reflecting that the risk of 
fractures should be considered in the long-term care of 
women treated with pioglitazone.  
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly.

raised the mean total area under the plasma concentration-
time (AUC) curve of pioglitazone 3.2 fold and prolonged its 
elimination half-life (T1/2) from 8.3 to 22.7 hours 
(P<0.001), but had no significant effect on its peak 
concentration (Cmax) compared with placebo (control). The 
Deng et al. study reported that gemfibrozil raised the mean 
total AUC of pioglitazone 3.4 fold and prolonged its T1/2 
from 6.5 to 15.1 hours (P<0.001), but had no significant 
effect on Cmax. 
In regards to Pioglitazone and Rifampicin interaction, 
Jaakkola, et al 2006 reported that rifampicin caused a 
decrease in the plasma concentration of pioglitazone, 
probably by induction of CYP2C8. 
The Jaakkola publication showed that the potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor itraconazole did not affect pioglitazone 
pharmacokinetics. 
Although the review of safety data did not provide any 
evidence of significant effects associated with interactions 
between pioglitazone and gemfibrozil and pioglitazone and 
rifampicin, there is a potential for interaction. 
Based on these data sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2 of the SPC 
have been updated to reflect the information regarding 
these reported drug interactions.

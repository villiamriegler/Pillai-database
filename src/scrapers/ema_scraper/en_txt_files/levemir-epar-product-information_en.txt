CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Levemir is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year 
and above. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The potency of insulin analogues, including insulin detemir, is expressed in units, whereas the potency 
of human insulin is expressed in international units. 1 unit insulin detemir corresponds to 
1 international unit of human insulin. 
Levemir can be used alone as the basal insulin or in combination with bolus insulin. It can also be used 
in combination with oral antidiabetic medicinal products and/or GLP-1 receptor agonists. 
When Levemir is used in combination with oral antidiabetic medicinal products or when added to 
GLP-1 receptor agonists it is recommended to use Levemir once daily, initially at a dose of 0.1–
0.2 units/kg or of 10 units in adult patients. The dose of Levemir should be titrated based on the 
individual patient’s needs. 
When a GLP-1 receptor agonist is added to Levemir, it is recommended to reduce the dose of Levemir 
by 20% to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. Subsequently, dosage should be adjusted individually. 
For individual dose adjustments, the following two titration guidelines are recommended for adults:

When Levemir is used as part of a basal-bolus insulin regimen, Levemir should be administered once 
or twice daily depending on patients’ needs. The dose of Levemir should be adjusted individually. 
Adjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their 
usual diet or during concomitant illness. 
When adjusting dose in order to improve glucose control, patients should be advised to be aware of 
signs of hypoglycaemia. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥65 years old) 
Levemir can be used in elderly patients. In elderly patients, glucose monitoring should be intensified 
and the Levemir dose adjusted on an individual basis. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements. 
In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the Levemir 
dose adjusted on an individual basis. 
Paediatric population 
Levemir can be used in adolescents and children from the age of 1 year (see section 5.1). When 
changing basal insulin to Levemir, dose reduction of basal and bolus insulin needs to be considered on 
an individual basis, in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
In children and adolescents, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the Levemir dose adjusted 
on an individual basis. 
The safety and efficacy of Levemir in children below the age of 1 year have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
When transferring from other intermediate or long-acting insulin medicinal products, adjustment of 
the dose and timing of administration may be necessary (see section 4.4). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks thereafter (see 
section 4.4). 
Concomitant antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted (dose and/or timing of oral antidiabetic 
medicinal products or concurrent short/rapid-acting insulin medicinal products). 
Method of administration 
Levemir is a long-acting insulin analogue used as a basal insulin. Levemir is for subcutaneous 
administration only. Levemir must not be administered intravenously, as it may result in severe 
hypoglycaemia. Intramuscular administration should also be avoided. Levemir is not to be used in 
insulin infusion pumps. 
Levemir is administered subcutaneously by injection in the abdominal wall, the thigh, the upper arm, 
the deltoid region or the gluteal region. Injection sites should always be rotated within the same region 
in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The 
duration of action will vary according to the dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature and level of 
physical activity. The injection can be given at any time during the day, but at the same time each day. 
For patients who require twice daily dosing to optimise blood glucose control, the evening dose can be 
administered in the evening or at bedtime. 
For detailed user instructions, please refer to the package leaflet.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctor’s advice since this 
may mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Inadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to 
hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop 
gradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, 
vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. 
In type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is 
potentially lethal. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Omission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. 
In children, care should be taken to match insulin doses (especially in basal-bolus regimens) with food 
intake and physical activities in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case 
of hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected, Levemir must not be injected. After stabilisation 
of the patient’s blood glucose, adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections 4.8 and 4.9). 
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may 
experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia, and should be advised 
accordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. 
Concomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient's 
insulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or 
thyroid gland can require changes in insulin dose. 
When patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning 
symptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with 
their previous insulin. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal insulin, human insulin or 
insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may 
result in the need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to Levemir from another type of insulin 
may require a change in dose from that used with their usual insulin medicinal products. If an 
adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or during the first few weeks or months. 
Injection site reactions 
As with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, 
inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given 
area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Levemir. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site from an affected to an 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unaffected area, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Hypoalbuminaemia 
There are limited data in patients with severe hypoalbuminaemia. Careful monitoring is recommended 
in these patients. 
Combination of Levemir with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Levemir is considered. If the combination 
is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Avoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors 
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between Levemir and other insulin products. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. 
The following substances may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements: 
Oral antidiabetic medicinal products, GLP-1 receptor agonists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOI), beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids 
and sulphonamides. 
The following substances may increase the patient’s insulin requirements: 
Oral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth 
hormone and danazol. 
Beta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
Octreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. 
Alcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
The use of Levemir in pregnant women with diabetes has been investigated in a clinical trial and in a 
prospective non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (see section 5.1). Post-marketing data in 
pregnant women using Levemir, with more than 4,500 pregnancy outcomes do not indicate any 
increased risk of malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity. Treatment with Levemir can be considered 
during pregnancy, if clinically needed. 
In general, intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are 
recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually 
fall in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and third trimester. After 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
delivery, insulin requirements normally return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether insulin detemir is excreted in human milk. No metabolic effects of ingested 
insulin detemir on the breast-fed newborn/infant are anticipated since insulin detemir, as a peptide, is 
digested into amino acids in the human gastrointestinal tract. 
Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or 
operating machinery). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions observed in patients using Levemir are mainly due to the pharmacologic effect of 
insulin. The overall percentage of treated patients expected to experience adverse reactions is 
estimated to be 12%. 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia, please see section 
4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions. 
From clinical investigations, it is known that major hypoglycaemia, defined as requirement for third 
party intervention, occurs in approximately 6% of the patients treated with Levemir. 
Injection site reactions are seen more frequently during treatment with Levemir than with human 
insulin products. These reactions include pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching at the injection site. Most of the injection site reactions are minor and of a transitory nature, i.e. 
they normally disappear during continued treatment in a few days to a few weeks. 
At the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies and oedema may occur; these reactions 
are usually of transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with 
acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt 
improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic 
retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic 
retinopathy. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions listed below are based on clinical trial data and classified according to MedDRA 
frequency and System Organ Class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following 
convention: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Allergic reactions, potentially allergic reactions, urticaria, rash, eruptions 
Allergic reactions, potentially allergic reactions, urticaria, rash and eruptions are uncommon when 
Levemir is used in basal-bolus regimen. However, when used in combination with oral antidiabetic 
medicinal products, three clinical studies have shown a frequency of common (2.2% of allergic 
reactions and potentially allergic reactions have been observed). 
Anaphylactic reactions 
The occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, 
sweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation and 
reduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life threatening. 
Hypoglycaemia 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too 
high in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or 
convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. 
The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale 
skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty 
in concentrating, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the 
injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the 
given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Based on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse 
reactions observed in the paediatric population do not indicate any differences to the broader 
experience in the general diabetes population.

Other special populations 
Based on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse 
reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate 
any differences to the broader experience in the general population. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
A specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over 
sequential stages if too high doses relative to the patient’s requirement are administered: 
• 
• 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary 
products. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing 
products. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with 
glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with 
glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, 
if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining 
consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in order to 
prevent a relapse.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, long-acting: 
ATC code: A10AE05. 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Levemir is a soluble, long-acting insulin analogue with a prolonged duration of effect used as a basal 
insulin. 
The blood glucose lowering effect of Levemir is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following 
binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose 
output from the liver. 
The time action profile of Levemir is statistically significantly less variable and therefore more 
predictable than for NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) insulin as seen from the within-subject 
Coefficients of Variation (CV) for the total and maximum pharmacodynamic effect in Table 1.

The prolonged action of Levemir is mediated by the strong self-association of insulin detemir 
molecules at the injection site and albumin binding via the fatty acid side-chain. Insulin detemir is 
distributed more slowly to peripheral target tissues compared to NPH insulin. These combined 
mechanisms of protraction provide a more reproducible absorption and action profile of insulin 
detemir compared to NPH insulin.

Figure 1. Activity profiles of Levemir in patients with type 1 diabetes 
The duration of action is up to 24 hours depending on dose providing an opportunity for once or twice 
daily administration. If administered twice daily, steady state will occur after 2–3 dose 
administrations. For doses in the interval of 0.2–0.4 units/kg (U/kg), Levemir exerts more than 50% of 
its maximum effect from 3–4 hours and up to approximately 14 hours after dose administration. 
Dose proportionality in pharmacodynamic response (maximum effect, duration of action, total effect) 
is observed after subcutaneous administration. 
Lower day-to-day variability in FPG was demonstrated during treatment with Levemir compared to 
NPH in long-term clinical trials. 
Studies in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin in combination with oral antidiabetic 
medicinal products demonstrated that glycaemic control (HbA1c) with Levemir is comparable to NPH 
insulin and insulin glargine and associated with less weight gain, see Table 2 below. In the study 
versus insulin glargine, Levemir was allowed to be administered once or twice daily whereas insulin 
glargine was to be administered once a day, 55% of the Levemir treated patients completed the 
52 weeks of treatment on the twice daily regimen.

In trials investigating the use of oral antidiabetic medicinal products, combination therapy with 
Levemir resulted in a 61-65% lower risk of minor nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared to NPH insulin. 
An open-label randomised clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes not reaching target with oral 
antidiabetic medicinal products was conducted. The trial started with a 12-week run-in period with 
liraglutide+metformin, where 61% reached an HbA1c <7%. The 39% of patients not achieving target

were randomised to have Levemir once-daily added or continue on liraglutide+metformin for 
52 weeks. Addition of Levemir provided a further reduction of HbA1c from 7.6% to 7.1% after 
52 weeks. There were no major hypoglycaemic episodes. A major hypoglycaemic episode is defined 
as an episode where the subject was not able to treat him/herself and if glucagon or i.v. glucose was 
needed. See Table 3.

Minor hypoglycaemic 
episodes (per patient year) 
A 26-week, double blind, randomised clinical trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety 
of adding liraglutide (1.8 mg) vs. placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on 
basal insulin with or without metformin. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% for patients with 
baseline HbA1c ≤8.0% in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. Subsequently, patients were 
allowed to up-titrate their insulin dose to no higher than the pre-randomisation dose. Levemir was the 
basal insulin product for 33% (n=147) of the patients (97.3% using metformin). In these patients, 
addition of liraglutide resulted in a greater decline in HbA1c compared to addition of placebo (to 6.93% 
vs. to 8.24%), a greater decline in fasting plasma glucose (to 7.20 mmol/l vs. to 8.13 mmol/l), and a 
greater decline in body weight (-3.47 kg vs. -0.43 kg). Baseline values for these parameters were 
similar in the two groups. Observed rates of minor hypoglycaemic episodes were similar and no severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes were observed in either group. 
In long-term trials in patients with type 1 diabetes receiving a basal-bolus insulin therapy, fasting 
plasma glucose was improved with Levemir compared with NPH insulin. Glycaemic control (HbA1c) 
with Levemir was comparable to NPH insulin, with a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia and no 
associated weight gain. 
In clinical trials using basal bolus insulin therapy, the overall rates of hypoglycaemia with Levemir 
and NPH insulin were similar. Analyses of nocturnal hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes 
showed a significantly lower risk of minor nocturnal hypoglycaemia (able to self-treat and confirmed 
by capillary blood glucose less than 2.8 mmol/l or 3.1 mmol/l if expressed as plasma glucose) than 
with NPH insulin, whereas no difference was seen in type 2 diabetes. 
Antibody development has been observed with the use of Levemir. However, this does not appear to 
have any impact on glycaemic control. 
Pregnancy 
In a prospective non-interventional post-authorisation safety study, pregnant women with type 1 or 
type 2 diabetes exposed to Levemir (n=727, 680 liveborn infants) or other basal insulins (n=730, 668 
liveborn infants) were monitored for pregnancy outcomes. 
No statistically significant difference was observed between Levemir and other basal insulins for the 
components of the malformation endpoint (induced abortion due to major congenital malformations, 
major congenital malformations or minor congenital malformations). The results from the study 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indicated that Levemir is not associated with an excess risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, when 
compared to other basal insulins, in women with pre-existing diabetes. 
Levemir has been studied in an open-label randomised controlled clinical trial, in which pregnant 
women with type 1 diabetes (n=310) were treated with a basal-bolus treatment regimen with Levemir 
(n=152) or NPH insulin (n=158) as basal insulin, both in combination with NovoRapid. 
Levemir was non-inferior to NPH insulin as measured by HbA1c at gestational week (GW) 36, and the 
reduction in mean HbA1c through pregnancy was similar. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of Levemir has been studied for up to 12 months, in three randomised 
controlled clinical trials in adolescents and children (n=1,045 in total); the trials included in total 167 
children aged 1–5 years. The trials demonstrated that glycaemic control (HbA1c) with Levemir is 
comparable to NPH insulin and insulin degludec when given as basal-bolus therapy, using a non-
inferiority margin of 0.4%. In the trial comparing Levemir vs. insulin degludec, the rate of 
hyperglycaemic episodes with ketosis was significantly higher for Levemir, 1.09 and 0.68 episodes per 
patient-year of exposure, respectively. Less weight gain (SD score, weight corrected for gender and 
age) was observed with Levemir than with NPH insulin. 
The trial including children above 2 years was extended for an additional 12 months (total of 
24 months treatment data) to assess antibody formation after long-term treatment with Levemir. After 
an increase in insulin antibodies during the first year, the insulin antibodies decreased during the 
second year to a level slightly higher than pre-trial level. Results indicate that antibody development 
had no negative effect on glycaemic control and Levemir dose. 
Efficacy and safety data for adolescent patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have been extrapolated 
from data for children, adolescent and adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and adult patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results support the use of Levemir in adolescent patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Maximum serum concentration is reached between 6 and 8 hours after administration. When 
administered twice daily, steady state serum concentrations are reached after 2–3 dose administrations. 
Within-patient variation in absorption is lower for Levemir than for other basal insulin preparations. 
The absolute bioavailability of insulin detemir when administered subcutaneous is approximately 
60%. 
Distribution 
An apparent volume of distribution for Levemir (approximately 0.1 l/kg) indicates that a high fraction 
of insulin detemir is circulating in the blood. 
The results of the in vitro and in vivo protein binding studies suggest that there is no clinically relevant 
interaction between insulin detemir and fatty acids or other protein bound medicinal products. 
Biotransformation 
Degradation of insulin detemir is similar to that of human insulin; all metabolites formed are inactive. 
Elimination 
The terminal half-life after subcutaneous administration is determined by the rate of absorption from 
the subcutaneous tissue. The terminal half-life is between 5 and 7 hours depending on the dose. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linearity 
Dose proportionality in serum concentrations (maximum concentration, extent of absorption) is 
observed after subcutaneous administration in the therapeutic dose range. 
No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed between liraglutide and Levemir 
when administering a single dose of Levemir 0.5 units/kg with liraglutide 1.8 mg at steady state in 
patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥65 years old) 
There was no clinically relevant difference in pharmacokinetics of Levemir between elderly and 
young patients. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
There was no clinically relevant difference in pharmacokinetics of Levemir between patients with 
renal or hepatic impairment and healthy subjects. As the pharmacokinetics of Levemir has not been 
studied extensively in these populations, it is advised to monitor plasma glucose closely in these 
populations. 
Gender 
There are no clinically relevant differences between genders in pharmacokinetic properties of 
Levemir. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetic properties of Levemir were investigated in young children (1–5 years), children 
(6–12 years) and adolescents (13–17 years) and compared to adults with type 1 diabetes. There were 
no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetic properties between young children, children, 
adolescents and adults. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. 
Receptor affinity data and in vitro mitogenicity tests revealed no evidence of an increased mitogenic 
potential compared to human insulin.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Levemir is and what it is used for 
Levemir is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with a long-acting effect. Modern insulin products are 
improved versions of human insulin. 
Levemir is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year 
and above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce 
enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. 
Levemir can be used with meal-related rapid acting insulin medicines. 
In treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, Levemir may also be used in combination with tablets for 
diabetes and/or with injectable anti-diabetic products, other than insulin. 
Levemir has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action within 3 to 4 hours after injection. 
Levemir provides up to 24 hours of basal insulin coverage. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Levemir

If you are allergic to insulin detemir or any of the other ingredients in this medicine, see section 
6, Contents of the pack and other information. 
If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see a) Summary of serious and very 
common side effects in section 4. 
In insulin infusion pumps. 
If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. 
If it has not been stored correctly or been frozen, see section 5, How to store Levemir. 
If the insulin does not appear water clear, colourless and aqueous. 
If any of these applies, do not use Levemir. Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. 
Before using Levemir 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
►  Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. 
►  Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not 
use it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band 
at the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that 
the cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further 
instructions. 
►  Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
►  Needles and Levemir Penfill must not be shared. 
► 
Levemir Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your 
doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. 
If you have very low albumin you need to carefully monitor your blood sugar level. Discuss this 
with your doctor. 
► 
► 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3, How to use Levemir). Tell your doctor 
if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
Levemir can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. 
The safety and efficacy of Levemir in children below 1 year of age have not been established. 
No data are available.  
Other medicines and Levemir 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) 
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) 
Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) 
Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). 
• 
• 
• 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) 
Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) 
Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat 
asthma) 
Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body’s metabolic processes) 
Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). 
• 
• 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Drinking alcohol and taking Levemir 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during 
pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of 
hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin 
doses. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react  
and therefore also your ability to drive a car or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could 
endanger yourself or others. 
Important information about some of the ingredients in Levemir 
Levemir contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Levemir is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How to use Levemir 
Dose and when to take your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Levemir can be used with meal-related rapid acting insulin medicines. 
In treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, Levemir may also be used in combination with tablets for 
diabetes and/or with injectable anti-diabetic products, other than insulin. 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. 
Your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor if: 
• 
• 
your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another, or 
your doctor has added another medicine for the treatment of diabetes, in addition to your 
Levemir treatment. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Levemir can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. 
There is no experience with the use of Levemir in children below the age of 1 year. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How often to inject 
When Levemir is used in combination with tablets for diabetes and/or in combination with injectable 
anti-diabetic products, other than insulin, Levemir should be administered once a day. When Levemir 
is used as part of a basal-bolus insulin regimen Levemir should be administered once or twice daily 
depending on patients’ needs. Dose of Levemir should be adjusted individually. The injection can be 
given at any time during the day, but at the same time each day. For patients who require twice daily 
dosing to optimise blood sugar control, the evening dose can be administered in the evening or at 
bedtime. 
How and where to inject 
Levemir is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject Levemir directly into 
a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Levemir Penfill is only suitable for injecting under 
the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another 
method. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your thighs, the front of your waist (abdomen), or 
the upper arm. You should always measure your blood sugar regularly. 
►  Do not refill the cartridge. 
► 
Levemir Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems 
and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles. 
If you are treated with Levemir Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use two 
insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. 
► 
►  Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How to inject Levemir 
► 
Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse 
and as described in your pen manual. 
►  Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed 
until the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit 
possible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. 
►  After each injection be sure to remove and discard the needle and store Levemir without the 
needle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
If you take more insulin than you should 
If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of 
serious and very common side effects in section 4. 
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) 
Effects from diabetes in section 4. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
a) 
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 
people. 
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol (see section 2 Drinking alcohol and taking Levemir). 
• 
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon given by someone who 
knows how to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you 
are conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
►  When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
► 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
If you have such low blood sugar that makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. 
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink because you may choke. 
Serious allergic reaction to Levemir or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) is a 
very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
b) 
List of other side effects 
Uncommon side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 100 people. 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately. See also Serious allergic reaction above. 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. 
Rare side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may 
get nerve related pain, this is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) 
Effects from diabetes 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin. 
Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. 
Get an infection and/or a fever. 
Eat more than usual. 
Exercise less than usual. 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
► 
If you get any of above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you can, 
then seek medical advice immediately. 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

►  Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
►  Needles and Levemir FlexPen must not be shared. 
► 
Levemir FlexPen is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need 
to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. 
If you have very low albumin you need to carefully monitor your blood sugar level. Discuss this 
with your doctor. 
► 
► 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3, How to use Levemir). Tell your doctor 
if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
Levemir can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. 
The safety and efficacy of Levemir in children below 1 year of age have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Other medicines and Levemir 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) 
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) 
Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) 
Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) 
Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat 
asthma) 
Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body’s metabolic processes) 
Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Drinking alcohol and taking Levemir 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during 
pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of 
hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin 
doses. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive a car or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Important information about some of the ingredients in Levemir 
Levemir contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Levemir is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Levemir 
Dose and when to take your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Levemir can be used with meal-related rapid acting insulin medicines. 
In treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, Levemir may also be used in combination with tablets for 
diabetes and/or with injectable anti-diabetic products, other than insulin. 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. 
Your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor if: 
• 
• 
your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another, or 
your doctor has added another medicine for the treatment of diabetes, in addition to your 
Levemir treatment. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Levemir can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. 
There is no experience with the use of Levemir in children below the age of 1 year. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How often to inject 
When Levemir is used in combination with tablets for diabetes and/or in combination with injectable 
anti-diabetic products, other than insulin, Levemir should be administered once a day. When Levemir 
is used as part of a basal-bolus insulin regimen Levemir should be administered once or twice daily 
depending on patients’ needs. Dose of Levemir should be adjusted individually. The injection can be 
given at any time during the day, but at the same time each day. For patients who require twice daily 
dosing to optimise blood sugar control, the evening dose can be administered in the evening or at 
bedtime. 
How and where to inject 
Levemir is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject Levemir directly into 
a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Levemir FlexPen is only suitable for injecting 
under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your thighs, the front of your waist (abdomen), or 
the upper arm. You should always measure your blood sugar regularly. 
How to handle Levemir FlexPen 
Levemir FlexPen is a pre-filled, colour-coded, disposable pen containing insulin detemir. 
Read carefully the instructions for use included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as 
described in the Instructions for use. 
Always ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. 
If you take more insulin than you should 
If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of 
serious and very common side effects in section 4. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) 
Effects from diabetes in section 4. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
a) 
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 
people. 
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol (see section 2 Drinking alcohol and taking Levemir). 
• 
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon given by someone who 
knows how to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you 
are conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
►  When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
► 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
If you have such low blood sugar that makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. 
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink because you may choke. 
Serious allergic reaction to Levemir or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) is a 
very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
b) 
List of other side effects 
Uncommon side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 100 people.  
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately. See also Serious allergic reaction above. 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. 
Rare side effects  
May affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may 
get nerve related pain, this is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
c) 
Effects from diabetes 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin. 
Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. 
Get an infection and/or a fever. 
Eat more than usual. 
Exercise less than usual. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
► 
If you get any of above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you can, 
then seek medical advice immediately. 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Instructions on how to use LEVEMIR solution for injection in a FlexPen 
Read the following instructions carefully before using your FlexPen. If you do not follow the 
instructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low 
blood sugar level. 
Your FlexPen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen. You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in 
increments of 1 unit. FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles 
up to a length of 8 mm. As a precautionary measure, always carry a spare insulin delivery device in 
case your FlexPen in use is lost or damaged.

Caring for your pen 
Your FlexPen must be handled with care. 
If it is dropped, damaged or crushed, there is a risk of insulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate 
dosing, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar level. 
You can clean the exterior of your FlexPen by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak it, wash 
or lubricate it as it may damage the pen. 
Do not refill your FlexPen. 
Preparing your Levemir FlexPen 
Check the name and coloured label of your pen to make sure that it contains the correct type of 
insulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong 
type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. 
A 
Pull off the pen cap. 
  A 
B 
Remove the paper tab from a new disposable needle. 
Screw the needle straight and tightly onto your FlexPen. 
  B 
C 
Pull off the big outer needle cap and keep it for later. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  C 
D 
Pull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. 
Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. 
  D 
Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, 
leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. 
Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. 
Checking the insulin flow 
Prior to each injection small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To 
avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: 
E 
Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. 
  E 
2 units 
selected 
F 
Hold your FlexPen with the needle pointing upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a 
few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. 
  F 
G 
Keeping the needle upwards, press the push-button all the way in. The dose selector returns to 0. 
A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no 
more than 6 times. 
If a drop of insulin still does not appear, the pen is defective, and you must use a new one. 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  G 
Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure that 
the insulin flows. If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose 
selector may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. 
Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little 
insulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. 
Selecting your dose 
Check that the dose selector is set at 0. 
H 
Turn the dose selector to select the number of units you need to inject. 
The dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the 
correct dose lines up with the pointer. When turning the dose selector be careful not to push the push-
button as insulin will come out. 
You cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. 
  H 
5 units 
selected 
24 units 
selected 
Always use the dose selector and the pointer to see how many units you have selected before 
injecting the insulin. 
Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may 
get too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows approximately how much 
insulin is left in your pen. 
Making the injection 
Insert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique shown by your doctor or nurse. 
I 
Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until 0 lines up with the pointer. Be careful 
only to push the push-button when injecting. 
Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  I 
J 
Keep the push-button fully depressed and let the needle remain under the skin for at least 6 seconds. 
This will make sure you get the full dose. 
Withdraw the needle from the skin then release the pressure on the push-button. 
Always make sure that the dose selector returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops 
before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood sugar 
level. 
  J 
K 
Lead the needle into the big outer needle cap without touching it. When the needle is covered, 
carefully push the big outer needle cap completely on and then unscrew the needle. 
Dispose of it carefully and put the pen cap back on your FlexPen. 
  K 
Always remove the needle after each injection and store your FlexPen without the needle 
attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles 
and inaccurate dosing. 
Further important information 
Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles – to reduce the risk of needle sticks 
and cross-infection. 
Dispose of your used FlexPen carefully without the needle attached. 
Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. 
Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. 
Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Levemir is and what it is used for 
Levemir is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with a long-acting effect. Modern insulin products are 
improved versions of human insulin. 
Levemir is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year 
and above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce 
enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. 
Levemir can be used with meal-related rapid acting insulin medicines. 
In treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, Levemir may also be used in combination with tablets for 
diabetes and/or with injectable anti-diabetic products, other than insulin. 
Levemir has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action within 3 to 4 hours after injection. 
Levemir provides up to 24 hours of basal insulin coverage.

Levemir InnoLet is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need 
to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. 
If you have very low albumin you need to carefully monitor your blood sugar level. Discuss this 
with your doctor. 
► 
► 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3, How to use Levemir). Tell your doctor 
if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
Levemir can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. 
The safety and efficacy of Levemir in children below 1 year of age have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Other medicines and Levemir

increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Drinking alcohol and taking Levemir 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during 
pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of 
hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin 
doses. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive a car or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Important information about some of the ingredients in Levemir 
Levemir contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Levemir is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Levemir 
Dose and when to take your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Levemir can be used with meal-related rapid acting insulin medicines. 
In treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, Levemir may also be used in combination with tablets for 
diabetes and/or with injectable anti-diabetic products, other than insulin. 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. 
Your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor if: 
• 
• 
your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another, or 
your doctor has added another medicine for the treatment of diabetes, in addition to your 
Levemir treatment. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Levemir can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. 
There is no experience with the use of Levemir in children below the age of 1 year. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How often to inject 
When Levemir is used in combination with tablets for diabetes and/or in combination with injectable 
anti-diabetic products, other than insulin, Levemir should be administered once a day. When Levemir 
is used as part of a basal-bolus insulin regimen Levemir should be administered once or twice daily 
depending on patients’ needs. Dose of Levemir should be adjusted individually. The injection can be 
given at any time during the day, but at the same time each day. For patients who require twice daily 
dosing to optimise blood sugar control, the evening dose can be administered in the evening or at 
bedtime. 
How and where to inject 
Levemir is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject Levemir directly into 
a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Levemir InnoLet is only suitable for injecting 
under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your thighs, the front of your waist (abdomen), or 
the upper arm. You should always measure your blood sugar regularly. 
How to handle Levemir InnoLet 
Levemir InnoLet is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin detemir. 
Read carefully the instructions for use included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as 
described in the Instructions for use. 
Always ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. 
If you take more insulin than you should 
If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of 
serious and very common side effects in section 4. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) 
Effects from diabetes in section 4. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
a) 
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 
people. 
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol (see section 2 Drinking alcohol and taking Levemir). 
• 
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon given by someone who 
knows how to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you 
are conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
►  When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
► 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
If you have such low blood sugar that makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. 
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink because you may choke. 
Serious allergic reaction to Levemir or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) is a 
very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
b) 
List of other side effects 
Uncommon side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 100 people. 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately. See also Serious allergic reaction above. 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. 
Rare side effects  
May affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may 
get nerve related pain, this is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
c) 
Effects from diabetes 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin. 
Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. 
Get an infection and/or a fever. 
Eat more than usual. 
Exercise less than usual. 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
► 
If you get any of above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you can, 
then seek medical advice immediately. 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Instructions on how to use LEVEMIR solution for injection in InnoLet 
Read the instructions carefully before using your InnoLet. If you do not follow the instructions 
carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar 
level. 
Your InnoLet is a simple, compact pre-filled pen able to deliver 1 to 50 units in increments of 1 unit. 
InnoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles up to a length of 
8 mm. As a precautionary measure, always carry a spare insulin delivery device in case your InnoLet 
in use is lost or damaged.

Getting started 
Check the name and coloured label of your InnoLet to make sure that it contains the correct type of 
insulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong 
type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. Take off the pen cap. 
Attaching the needle 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, 
leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. 
Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. 
Remove the paper tab from a new disposable needle. 
Screw the needle straight and tightly onto your InnoLet (picture A). 
Pull off the big outer needle cap and the inner needle cap. You may want to store the big 
outer needle cap in the compartment. 
Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the 
needle.

  A 
Priming to expel air prior to each injection 
Small amounts of air may collect in the needle and cartridge during normal use. 
To avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: 
• 
• 
Dial 2 units by turning the dose selector clockwise. 
Hold InnoLet with the needle upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few 
times (picture B) to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. 
Keeping the needle upwards, press the push-button and the dose selector returns to 0. 
Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before injection (picture B). This 
makes sure the insulin flows. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no more than 
6 times. 
• 
• 
If a drop of insulin still does not appear, the device is defective and must not be used. 
If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose selector may move. 
This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. 
Always prime InnoLet before you inject. If you do not prime InnoLet, you may get too little 
insulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. 
• 
• 
  B 
Setting the dose 
• 
• 
• 
Always check that the push-button is fully depressed and the dose selector is set to 0. 
Dial the number of units required by turning the dose selector clockwise (picture C). 
You will hear a click for every single unit dialled. The dose can be corrected by turning the 
dial either way. Make sure not to turn the dial or correct the dose when the needle is inserted in 
the skin. This may lead to inaccurate dosing that can make your blood sugar level too high or 
too low. 
Always use the dose scale and the dose selector to see how many units you have selected before 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
injecting the insulin. Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your 
blood sugar level may get too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows 
approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. 
You cannot set a dose larger than the number of units remaining in the cartridge. 
  C 
Injecting the insulin 
Insert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor. 
Deliver the dose by pressing the push-button fully down (picture D). You will hear clicks as 
the dose selector returns to 0. 
After the injection, the needle should remain under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure 
that the full dose has been delivered. 
Make sure not to block the dose selector while injecting, as the dose selector must be allowed 
to return to 0 when you press the push-button. Always make sure that the dose selector returns 
to 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been 
delivered, which may result in too high blood sugar level. 
Discard the needle after each injection. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
  D 
Removing the needle 
• 
• 
Replace the big outer needle cap and unscrew the needle (picture E). Dispose of it carefully. 
Put the pen cap back on your InnoLet to protect the insulin from light. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  E 
Always use a new needle for each injection.Always remove and discard the needle after each injection 
and store your InnoLet without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, 
leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. 
Further important information 
Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles – to reduce the risk of needle sticks and 
cross-infection 
Dispose of your used InnoLet carefully without the needle attached. 
Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. 
Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. 
Always keep your InnoLet and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. 
Caring for your pen 
Your InnoLet is designed to work accurately and safely. It must be handled with care. If it is dropped, 
damaged or crushed, there is a risk of insulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate dosing, which can 
lead to too high or too low blood sugar level. 
You can clean your InnoLet by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak, wash or lubricate it. 
This may damage the mechanism and may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to too high or too 
low blood sugar level. 
Do not refill your InnoLet.

Contents of the pack and other information  
1.  What Levemir is and what it is used for 
Levemir is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with a long-acting effect. Modern insulin products are 
improved versions of human insulin. 
Levemir is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year 
and above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce 
enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. 
Levemir can be used with meal-related rapid acting insulin medicines. 
In treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, Levemir may also be used in combination with tablets for 
diabetes and/or with injectable anti-diabetic products, other than insulin. 
Levemir has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action within 3 to 4 hours after injection. 
Levemir provides up to 24 hours of basal insulin coverage.

►  Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. 
►  Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
►  Needles and Levemir FlexTouch must not be shared. 
► 
Levemir FlexTouch is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you 
need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections.  
If you have very low albumin you need to carefully monitor your blood sugar level. Discuss this 
with your doctor. 
► 
► 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3, How to use Levemir). Tell your doctor 
if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
Levemir can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. 
The safety and efficacy of Levemir in children below 1 year of age have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Other medicines and Levemir 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes

Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) 
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) 
Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) 
Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation)

influence on the body’s metabolic processes) 
Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Drinking alcohol and taking Levemir 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during 
pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of 
hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin 
doses. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive a car or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Important information about some of the ingredients in Levemir 
Levemir contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Levemir is essentially ‘sodium-free’.

your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another, or 
your doctor has added another medicine for the treatment of diabetes, in addition to your 
Levemir treatment. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Levemir can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. 
There is no experience with the use of Levemir in children below the age of 1 year. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How often to inject 
When Levemir is used in combination with tablets for diabetes and/or in combination with injectable 
anti-diabetic products, other than insulin, Levemir should be administered once a day. When Levemir 
is used as part of a basal-bolus insulin regimen Levemir should be administered once or twice daily 
depending on patients’ needs. Dose of Levemir should be adjusted individually. The injection can be 
given at any time during the day, but at the same time each day. For patients who require twice daily 
dosing to optimise blood sugar control, the evening dose can be administered in the evening or at 
bedtime. 
How and where to inject 
Levemir is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject Levemir directly into 
a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Levemir FlexTouch is only suitable for injecting 
under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your thighs, the front of your waist (abdomen), or 
the upper arm. You should always measure your blood sugar regularly. 
How to handle Levemir FlexTouch 
Levemir FlexTouch is a pre-filled, colour-coded, disposable pen containing insulin detemir. 
Read carefully the instructions for use included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as 
described in the Instructions for use. 
Always ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. 
If you take more insulin than you should 
If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of 
serious and very common side effects in section 4.

If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) 
Effects from diabetes in section 4. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
a) 
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 
people. 
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol (see section 2 Drinking alcohol and taking Levemir). 
• 
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon given by someone who 
knows how to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you 
are conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
►  When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
► 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
If you have such low blood sugar that makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. 
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink because you may choke. 
Serious allergic reaction to Levemir or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) is a 
very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
b) 
List of other side effects 
Uncommon side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 100 people. 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately. See also Serious allergic reaction above. 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. 
Rare side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may 
get nerve related pain, this is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
c) 
Effects from diabetes 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin. 
Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. 
Get an infection and/or a fever. 
Eat more than usual. 
Exercise less than usual. 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
► 
If you get any of above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you can, 
then seek medical advice immediately. 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Instructions on how to use Levemir 100 units/ml solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
(FlexTouch) 
Please read these instructions carefully before using your FlexTouch pre-filled pen. If you do not 
follow the instructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high 
or too low blood sugar level. 
Do not use the pen without proper training from your doctor or nurse. 
Start by checking your pen to make sure that it contains Levemir 100 units/ml, then look at the 
illustrations to the right to get to know the different parts of your pen and needle. 
If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use 
this pen without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the FlexTouch 
pre-filled pen. 
Your Levemir FlexTouch pen is a pre-filled insulin pen Levemir FlexTouch contains 300 units of 
insulin and delivers doses from 1 to 80 units, in increments of 1 unit. 
Levemir FlexTouch is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist single-use disposable 
needles up to a length of 8 mm.

Preparing your Levemir FlexTouch pen 
Check the name and coloured label on your Levemir FlexTouch pen to make sure that it 
contains the type of insulin you need. This is especially important if you take more than one type of 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
insulin. If you take a wrong type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low.

Check that the insulin in your pen is clear and colourless. 
Look through the insulin window. If the insulin looks cloudy, do not use the pen. 
Take a new disposable needle and tear off the paper tab. 
Screw the needle straight onto the pen. Make sure the needle is on tight. 
E. 
Pull off the outer needle cap and save it. You will need it after the injection, to correctly remove 
the needle from the pen. 
Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you try to put it back on, you may 
accidentally stick yourself with the needle. 
A drop of insulin may appear at the needle tip. This is normal. 
  E 
82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, 
leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. 
  Never use a bent or damaged needle. 
Checking the insulin flow 
Make sure that you receive your full dose by always checking the insulin flow before you select 
and inject your dose. 
Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. 
F.

G.  Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. 
Tap the top of the pen a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. 
  G 
H. 
Press the dose button with your thumb until the dose counter returns to 0. The 0 must line up 
with the dose pointer. A drop of insulin will appear at the needle tip. 
If no drop appears, repeat steps F to H up to 6 times. If no drop appears after these new 
attempts, change the needle and repeat steps F to H once more. 
Do not use the pen if a drop of insulin still does not appear. 
  H 
  Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure 
that the insulin flows. If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose 
counter may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. 
  Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little 
insulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level.

Selecting your dose 
Use the dose selector on your Levemir FlexTouch pen to select your dose. You can select up to 
80 units per dose. 
I. 
Select the dose you need. You can turn the dose selector forwards or backwards. Stop when the 
right number of units lines up with the dose pointer. 
The dose selector clicks differently when turned forwards, backwards or past the number of 
units left. 
When the pen contains less than 80 units, the dose counter stops at the number of units left. 
  I

  Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many units you have selected 
before injecting the insulin. 
Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may 
get too high or too low. 
Do not use the insulin scale, it only shows approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. 
  How much insulin is left? 
The insulin scale shows you approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. 
Approx.

To see precisely how much insulin is left use the dose counter: 
Turn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. If it shows 80, at least 80 units are left in 
your pen. 
If it shows less than 80, the number shown is the number of units left in your pen. 
Turn the dose selector back until the dose counter shows 0. 
If you need more insulin than the units left in your pen, you can split your dose between two 
pens.

  Be very careful to calculate correctly if splitting your dose. 
If in doubt, take the full dose with a new pen. If you split the dose wrong, you will inject too 
little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar level. 
Injecting your dose 
Make sure that you receive your full dose by using the right injection technique. 
J. 
Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown you. Make sure you can see 
the dose counter. Do not touch the dose counter with your fingers. This could interrupt the 
injection. 
Press the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. The 0 must line up with the dose 
pointer. You may then hear or feel a click. 
After the dose counter has returned to 0, leave the needle under the skin for at least 6 seconds 
to make sure that you get your full dose. 
  J 
6 seconds 
K.  Remove the needle from the skin. 
After that, you may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip. This is normal and has no effect on 
the dose you just received.

Always dispose of the needle after each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, 
infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. If the needle is blocked, 
you will not inject any insulin. 
L. 
Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface. Do not touch the needle or the 
cap. 
Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap completely on and then unscrew 
the needle. Dispose of it carefully, and put the pen cap back on after every use. 
When the pen is empty, throw it away without a needle on as instructed by your doctor, nurse, 
pharmacist or local authorities. 
  L 
  Always watch the dose counter to know how many units you inject. The dose counter will 
show the exact number of units. Do not count the pen clicks. 
Hold the dose button down until the dose counter returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose 
counter stops before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too 
high blood sugar level. 
  Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the 
needle. 
  Always remove the needle after each injection and store your pen without the needle 
attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles 
and inaccurate dosing. 
Caring for your pen 
Treat your pen with care. Rough handling or misuse may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to 
too high or too low blood sugar level.

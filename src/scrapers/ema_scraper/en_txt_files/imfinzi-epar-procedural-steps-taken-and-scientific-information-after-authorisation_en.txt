1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

the recommendation for dose modification for ‘other 
immune-mediated adverse reactions’ as well as 
immune-mediated encephalitis, meningitis, Guillain-

The table on recommended treatment modifications in case 
of immune-mediated adverse reactions was updated as 
follows: immune-mediated meningitis has been added as a 
separate row, requiring intervention and permanent 
discontinuation for Grade 3 or 4, and intervention and 
withholding dose for Grade 2; immune-mediated 
encephalitis has been added as a separate row, requiring 
intervention and permanent discontinuation for Grade 2 – 
4; immune-mediated Guillain-Barré syndrome has been 
added as a separate row, requiring intervention and 
permanent discontinuation for Grade 2 – 4; ‘myasthenia 
gravis’ was changed to ‘immune-mediated myasthenia 
gravis’, requiring intervention and permanent 
discontinuation for Grade 2 – 4; other immune-mediated 
adverse reactions row was updated to require intervention 
and withholding dose for Grade 2 or 3.

clinically significant differences in efficacy and safety 
between durvalumab doses of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 
1500 mg every 4 weeks in locally advanced NSCLC. 
Patients with a body weight of 30 kg or less must receive 
weight-based dosing, equivalent to durvalumab 10 mg/kg

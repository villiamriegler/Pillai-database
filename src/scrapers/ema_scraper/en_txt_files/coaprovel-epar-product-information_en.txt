CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of essential hypertension. 
This fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately 
controlled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
CoAprovel can be taken once daily, with or without food.  
Dose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be 
recommended. 
When clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be 
considered: 
▪  CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not 
adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; 
▪  CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by 
irbesartan 300 mg or by CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg. 
▪  CoAprovel 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by 
CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg. 
Doses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. 
When necessary, CoAprovel may be administered with another antihypertensive medicinal product 
(see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1).

Special Populations 
Renal impairment  
Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, CoAprovel is not recommended for patients with severe 
renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides in this 
population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment whose renal 
creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
CoAprovel is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with 
caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage adjustment of CoAprovel is necessary in 
patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Older people 
No dosage adjustment of CoAprovel is necessary in older people. 
Paediatric population 
CoAprovel is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy 
have not been established. No data are available. 
Method of Administration 
For oral use. 
4.3  Contraindications 
▪  Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to 
other sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) 
▪  Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) 
▪  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) 
▪  Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia 
▪  Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis 
▪  The concomitant use of CoAprovel with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in 
patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
<60 ml/min/1.73 m²) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypotension - Volume-depleted patients: CoAprovel has been rarely associated with symptomatic 
hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for hypotension. Symptomatic 
hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous 
diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected 
before initiating therapy with CoAprovel. 
Renal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and 
renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single 
functioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II 
receptor antagonists. While this is not documented with CoAprovel, a similar effect should be 
anticipated. 
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation: when CoAprovel is used in patients with impaired renal 
function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. 
There is no experience regarding the administration of CoAprovel in patients with a recent kidney 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transplantation. CoAprovel should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotaemia may occur in patients 
with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment 
whose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be 
administered with caution. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the 
concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of 
hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual 
blockade of RAAS  through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or 
aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is 
considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to 
frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and 
angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic 
nephropathy. 
Hepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function 
or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate 
hepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with CoAprovel in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, 
special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Primary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to 
antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. 
Therefore, the use of CoAprovel is not recommended. 
Metabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. Latent diabetes 
mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy. Irbesartan may induce hypoglycaemia, 
particularly in diabetic patients. In patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics an appropriate blood 
glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics may be 
required when indicated (see section 4.5). 
Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; 
however at the 12.5 mg dose contained in CoAprovel, minimal or no effects were reported. 
Hyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide 
therapy. 
Electrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum 
electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. 
Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, 
hyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are 
dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, 
muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea 
or vomiting. 
Although hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with 
irbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients 
with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving 
inadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with 
corticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of CoAprovel hyperkalaemia 
might occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. 
Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts substitutes should be co-administered 
cautiously with CoAprovel (see section 4.5). 
There is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride 
deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. 
Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of 
serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia 
may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out 
tests for parathyroid function. 
Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in 
hypomagnesaemia. 
Lithium: the combination of lithium and CoAprovel is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Anti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive 
analytic result in an anti-doping test. 
General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or 
underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated 
with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any 
antihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or 
ischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. 
Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of 
allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 
Exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide 
diuretics. 
Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If 
photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-
administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the 
sun or to artificial UVA. 
Pregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. 
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be 
changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in 
pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, 
and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Choroidal effusion, Acute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs 
or sulfonamide derivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in choroidal effusion 
with visual field defect, transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. While 
hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been 
reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or 
ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure 
glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as 
rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular 
pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include 
a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8).

Excipients: 
CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg tablet contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg tablet contains sodium. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium 
(23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer 
An increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous 
cell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has 
been observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. 
Photosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. 
Patients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their 
skin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive 
measures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate 
protection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious 
skin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. 
The use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC 
(see also section 4.8). 
Acute Respiratory Toxicity 
Very rare severe cases of acute respiratory toxicity, including acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) have been reported after taking hydrochlorothiazide. Pulmonary oedema typically develops 
within minutes to hours after hydrochlorothiazide intake. At the onset, symptoms include dyspnoea, 
fever, pulmonary deterioration and hypotension. If diagnosis of ARDS is suspected, CoAprovel should 
be withdrawn and appropriate treatment given. Hydrochlorothiazide should not be administered to 
patients who previously experienced ARDS following hydrochlorothiazide intake. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Other antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of CoAprovel may be increased with the 
concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 
300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely administered with other 
antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers. Prior 
treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when 
initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless the volume depletion is 
corrected first (see section 4.4). 
Aliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events 
such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) 
compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Lithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects 
have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is 
reduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with CoAprovel. Therefore, the 
combination of lithium and CoAprovel is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination 
proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. 
Medicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is 
attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide 
on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with 
potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
carbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other 
medicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing 
diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products 
that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum 
potassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see 
section 4.4). 
Medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum 
potassium is recommended when CoAprovel is administered with medicinal products affected by 
serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered 
simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, 
acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect 
may occur. 
As with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an 
increased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in 
serum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should 
be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and 
consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and 
periodically thereafter. 
Repaglinide: irbesartan has the potential to inhibit OATP1B1. In a clinical study, it was reported that 
irbesartan increased the Cmax and AUC of repaglinide (substrate of OATP1B1) by 1.8-fold and 
1.3-fold, respectively, when administered 1 hour before repaglinide. In another study, no relevant 
pharmacokinetic interaction was reported, when the two drugs were co-administered. Therefore, dose 
adjustment of antidiabetic treatment such as repaglinide may be required (see section 4.4). 
Additional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan 
is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser 
extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were 
observed when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by 
CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan 
have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of 
irbesartan. 
Additional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the 
following medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: 
Alcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; 
Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic 
medicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); 
Colestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of 
anionic exchange resins. CoAprovel should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these 
medications; 
Corticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; 
Digitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favour the onset of 
digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not 
sufficiently to preclude their use; 
Nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal 
muscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; 
Antigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as 
hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or 
sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence 
of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; 
Calcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If 
calcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be 
prescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; 
Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with 
the risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If 
possible, another class of diuretics should be used; 
Other interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by 
thiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden) may increase the bioavailability of thiazide-
type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides may 
increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of 
cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their 
myelosuppressive effects. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) 
The use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The 
use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 
and 4.4). 
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors 
during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk 
cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II 
Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued 
AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative 
antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When 
pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, 
alternative therapy should be started. 
Exposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human 
foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal 
toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). 
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check 
of renal function and skull is recommended. 
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
There is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first 
trimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the 
pharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third 
trimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like 
icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. 
Hydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or 
preeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a 
beneficial effect on the course of the disease. 
Hydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare 
situations where no other treatment could be used. 
Since CoAprovel contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended during the first trimester of 
pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) 
Because no information is available regarding the use of CoAprovel during breast-feeding, CoAprovel 
is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-
feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. 
It is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its 
metabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing 
intense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of CoAprovel during breast feeding is not 
recommended. If CoAprovel is used during breast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. 
Fertility 
Irbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing 
the first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, CoAprovel is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use 
machines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that 
occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination 
Among 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients 
experienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue 
(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in 
the trials. 
Table 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled 
trials. 
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: 
very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects 
are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Non-melanoma skin cancer: Based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose 
dependent association between HCTZ and NMSC has been observed (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may 
increase when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose 
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with CoAprovel. The patient should 
be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends 
on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of 
emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum 
electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should 
be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. 
The most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; 
bradycardia might also occur. 
Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, 
hypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most 
common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in 
muscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis 
glycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. 
Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by 
haemodialysis has not been established. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations 
ATC code: C09DA04. 
Mechanism of action 
CoAprovel is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, and a thiazide 
diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive 
effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. 
Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is 
expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source 
or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors 
results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma 
aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at 
the recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also 
degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its 
activity. 
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide 
diuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, 
directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The 
diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, 
increases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these 
diuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at 
about 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. 
The combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in 
blood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to 
300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted 
in further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 
6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an 
overall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. 
Limited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the 
300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an 
incremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). 
Once daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic 
mean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg 
in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg 
hydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours 
period with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When 
measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of 
CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff during office 
visits were 68% and 76% for CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg and CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg, 
respectively. These 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak 
and are consistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. 
In patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan 
gave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. 
The blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent 
after the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by 6-
8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained 
for over one year. Although not specifically studied with the CoAprovel, rebound hypertension has not 
been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. 
The effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has 
not been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with 
hydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. 
There is no difference in response to CoAprovel, regardless of age or gender. As is the case with other 
medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably 
less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low 
dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients 
approaches that of non-black patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Efficacy and safety of CoAprovel as initial therapy for severe hypertension (defined as SeDBP 
≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 8-week, 
parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-
titrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, 
and just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were 
hyperlipidaemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of 
the participants. 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was 
controlled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on 
the combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan 
(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment 
group and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). 
The types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were 
similar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, 
there were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients 
with hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the 
combination and monotherapy groups, respectively. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in 
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs 
Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an 
angiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of 
end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
diabetic nephropathy. 
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and 
mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as 
compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these 
results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in 
patients with diabetic nephropathy. 
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) 
was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor 
or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney 
disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk 
of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the 
aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest 
(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren 
group than in the placebo group. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer:  
Based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between 
HCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of 
BCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. 
High HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-
1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship 
was observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer 
(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, 
using a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an 
adjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR 
7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Concomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. 
Absorption 
Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for 
their activity. Following oral administration of CoAprovel, the absolute oral bioavailability is 60-80% 
and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does not affect the 
bioavailability of CoAprovel. Peak plasma concentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral 
administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood 
components. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% 
protein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Irbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. 
A less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the 
mechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, 
respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma 
concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited 
accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, 
somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. 
However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage 
adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat 
greater in older subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal 
half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in older people. The mean 
plasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. 
Biotransformation 
Following oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma 
radioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via 
glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide 
(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the 
cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  
Elimination 
Irbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or 
intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, 
and the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged 
irbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least 
61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the 
placental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. 
Renal impairment  
In patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters 
of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with 
creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to 
increase to 21 hours. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not 
significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
The potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was 
evaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings 
observed of relevance to human therapeutic use. 
The following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
combination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products 
alone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions 
were observed): 
▪  kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and 
▪ 
▪ 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the 
interaction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; 
slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); 
stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in a 
6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; 
▪  decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when 
hydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. 
Most of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan 
(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing 
cells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no 
relevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. 
No teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at 
doses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination 
on fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on 
fertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. 
However, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given 
alone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when 
given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
combination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not 
been evaluated in animal studies. 
Irbesartan 
There was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In 
non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in 
macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). 
At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial 
nephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and 
creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the 
hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, 
irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in 
macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the 
pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. 
Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at 
oral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including 
mortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live 
foetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. 
Studies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. 
Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. 
Animal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, 
hydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, 
abortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including 
mortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Although equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental 
models, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association 
between its use and an increase in neoplasms.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of essential hypertension. 
This fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately 
controlled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
CoAprovel can be taken once daily, with or without food.  
Dose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be 
recommended. 
When clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be 
considered: 
▪  CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not 
adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; 
▪  CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by 
irbesartan 300 mg or by CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg. 
▪  CoAprovel 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by 
CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg. 
Doses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. 
When necessary, CoAprovel may be administered with another antihypertensive medicinal product 
(see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1).

Special Populations 
Renal impairment  
Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, CoAprovel is not recommended for patients with severe 
renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides in this 
population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment whose renal 
creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment  
CoAprovel is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with 
caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage adjustment of CoAprovel is necessary in 
patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Older people 
No dosage adjustment of CoAprovel is necessary in older people. 
Paediatric population 
CoAprovel is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy 
have not been established. No data are available. 
Method of Administration 
For oral use. 
4.3  Contraindications 
▪  Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to 
other sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) 
▪  Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) 
▪  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) 
▪  Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia 
▪  Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis 
▪  The concomitant use of CoAprovel with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated  in 
patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
<60 ml/min/1.73 m²) (see sections  4.5 and 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypotension - Volume-depleted patients: CoAprovel has been rarely associated with symptomatic 
hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for hypotension. Symptomatic 
hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous 
diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected 
before initiating therapy with CoAprovel. 
Renal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and 
renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single 
functioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II 
receptor antagonists. While this is not documented with CoAprovel, a similar effect should be 
anticipated. 
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation: when CoAprovel is used in patients with impaired renal 
function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. 
There is no experience regarding the administration of CoAprovel in patients with a recent kidney 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transplantation. CoAprovel should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotaemia may occur in patients 
with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment 
whose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be 
administered with caution. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the 
concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of 
hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual 
blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or 
aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is 
considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to 
frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and 
angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic 
nephropathy. 
Hepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function 
or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate 
hepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with CoAprovel in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, 
special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Primary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to 
antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. 
Therefore, the use of CoAprovel is not recommended. 
Metabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. Latent diabetes 
mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy. Irbesartan may induce hypoglycaemia, 
particularly in diabetic patients. In patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics an appropriate blood 
glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics may be 
required when indicated (see section 4.5). 
Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; 
however at the 12.5 mg dose contained in CoAprovel, minimal or no effects were reported. 
Hyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide 
therapy. 
Electrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum 
electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. 
Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, 
hyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are 
dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, 
muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea 
or vomiting. 
Although hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with 
irbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients 
with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving 
inadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with 
corticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of CoAprovel hyperkalaemia 
might occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. 
Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts substitutes should be co-administered 
cautiously with CoAprovel (see section 4.5). 
There is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride 
deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. 
Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of 
serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia 
may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out 
tests for parathyroid function. 
Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in 
hypomagnesaemia. 
Lithium: the combination of lithium and CoAprovel is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Anti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive 
analytic result in an anti-doping test. 
General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or 
underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated 
with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any 
antihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or 
ischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. 
Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of 
allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 
Exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide 
diuretics. 
Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If 
photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-
administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the 
sun or to artificial UVA. 
Pregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. 
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be 
changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in 
pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, 
and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Choroidal effusion, Acute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs 
or sulfonamide derivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in choroidal effusion 
with visual field defect, transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. While 
hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been 
reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or 
ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure 
glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as 
rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular 
pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include 
a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8).

Excipients: 
CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg tablet contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg tablet contains sodium. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium 
(23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer 
An increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous 
cell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has 
been observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. 
Photosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. 
Patients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their 
skin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive 
measures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate 
protection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious 
skin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. 
The use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC 
(see also section 4.8). 
Acute Respiratory Toxicity 
Very rare severe cases of acute respiratory toxicity, including acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) have been reported after taking hydrochlorothiazide. Pulmonary oedema typically develops 
within minutes to hours after hydrochlorothiazide intake. At the onset, symptoms include dyspnoea, 
fever, pulmonary deterioration and hypotension. If diagnosis of ARDS is suspected, CoAprovel should 
be withdrawn and appropriate treatment given. Hydrochlorothiazide should not be administered to 
patients who previously experienced ARDS following hydrochlorothiazide intake. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Other antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of CoAprovel may be increased with the 
concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 
300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely administered with other 
antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers. Prior 
treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when 
initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless the volume depletion is 
corrected first (see section 4.4). 
Aliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events 
such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) 
compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Lithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects 
have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is 
reduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with CoAprovel. Therefore, the 
combination of lithium and CoAprovel is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination 
proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. 
Medicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is 
attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide 
on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with 
potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, 
carbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other 
medicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products 
that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum 
potassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see 
section 4.4). 
Medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum 
potassium is recommended when CoAprovel is administered with medicinal products affected by 
serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered 
simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, 
acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect 
may occur. 
As with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an 
increased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in 
serum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should 
be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and 
consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and 
periodically thereafter. 
Repaglinide: irbesartan has the potential to inhibit OATP1B1. In a clinical study, it was reported that 
irbesartan increased the Cmax and AUC of repaglinide (substrate of OATP1B1) by 1.8-fold and 
1.3-fold, respectively, when administered 1 hour before repaglinide. In another study, no relevant 
pharmacokinetic interaction was reported, when the two drugs were co-administered. Therefore, dose 
adjustment of antidiabetic treatment such as repaglinide may be required (see section 4.4). 
Additional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan 
is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser 
extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were 
observed when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by 
CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan 
have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of 
irbesartan. 
Additional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the 
following medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: 
Alcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; 
Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic 
medicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); 
Colestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of 
anionic exchange resins. CoAprovel should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these 
medications; 
Corticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; 
Digitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favour the onset of 
digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; 
Pressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not 
sufficiently to preclude their use; 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal 
muscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; 
Antigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as 
hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or 
sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence 
of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; 
Calcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If 
calcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be 
prescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; 
Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with 
the risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If 
possible, another class of diuretics should be used; 
Other interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by 
thiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden) may increase the bioavailability of thiazide-
type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides may 
increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of 
cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their 
myelosuppressive effects. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) 
The use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The 
use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 
and 4.4). 
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors 
during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk 
cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II 
Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued 
AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative 
antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When 
pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, 
alternative therapy should be started. 
Exposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human 
foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal 
toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). 
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check 
of renal function and skull is recommended. 
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
There is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first 
trimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third 
trimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like 
icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. 
Hydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or 
preeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a 
beneficial effect on the course of the disease. 
Hydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare 
situations where no other treatment could be used. 
Since CoAprovel contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended during the first trimester of 
pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) 
Because no information is available regarding the use of CoAprovel during breast-feeding, CoAprovel 
is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-
feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. 
It is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its 
metabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing 
intense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of CoAprovel during breast feeding is not 
recommended. If CoAprovel is used during breast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. 
Fertility 
Irbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing 
the first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, CoAprovel is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use 
machines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that 
occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination 
Among 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients 
experienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue 
(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in 
the trials. 
Table 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled 
trials.

The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: 
very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects 
are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

increase when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.9  Overdose 
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with CoAprovel. The patient should 
be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends 
on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of 
emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum 
electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should 
be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. 
The most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; 
bradycardia might also occur. 
Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, 
hypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most 
common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in 
muscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis 
glycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. 
Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by 
haemodialysis has not been established. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations 
ATC code: C09DA04. 
Mechanism of action 
CoAprovel is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, and a thiazide 
diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive 
effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. 
Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is 
expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source 
or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors 
results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma 
aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at 
the recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also 
degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its 
activity. 
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide 
diuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, 
directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The 
diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, 
increases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, 
and decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these 
diuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at 
about 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. 
The combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in 
blood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted 
in further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 
6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an 
overall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. 
Limited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the 
300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an 
incremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). 
Once daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic 
mean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg 
in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg 
hydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours 
period with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When 
measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of 
CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff during office 
visits were 68% and 76% for CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg and CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg, 
respectively. These 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak 
and are consistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. 
In patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan 
gave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. 
The blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent 
after the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by 6-
8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained 
for over one year. Although not specifically studied with the CoAprovel, rebound hypertension has not 
been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. 
The effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has 
not been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with 
hydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. 
There is no difference in response to CoAprovel, regardless of age or gender. As is the case with other 
medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably 
less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low 
dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients 
approaches that of non-black patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Efficacy and safety of CoAprovel as initial therapy for severe hypertension (defined as SeDBP 
≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 8-week, 
parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-
titrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. 
The study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, 
and just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were 
hyperlipidaemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of 
the participants. 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was 
controlled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan 
(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment 
group and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). 
The types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were 
similar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, 
there were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients 
with hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the 
combination and monotherapy groups, respectively. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in 
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs 
Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an 
angiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of 
end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
diabetic nephropathy. 
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and 
mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as 
compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these 
results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in 
patients with diabetic nephropathy. 
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) 
was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor 
or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney 
disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk 
of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the 
aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest 
(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren 
group than in the placebo group. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer:  
Based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between 
HCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of 
BCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. 
High HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-
1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship 
was observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer 
(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, 
using a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an 
adjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR 
7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Concomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for 
their activity. Following oral administration of CoAprovel, the absolute oral bioavailability is 60-80% 
and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does not affect the 
bioavailability of CoAprovel. Peak plasma concentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral 
administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood 
components. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% 
protein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. 
Linearity/non-linearity  
Irbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. 
A less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the 
mechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, 
respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma 
concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited 
accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, 
somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. 
However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage 
adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat 
greater in older subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal 
half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in older people. The mean 
plasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. 
Biotransformation 
Following oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma 
radioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via 
glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide 
(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the 
cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  
Elimination 
Irbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or 
intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, 
and the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged 
irbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least 
61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the 
placental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. 
Renal impairment  
In patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters 
of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with 
creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to 
increase to 21 hours. 
Hepatic impairment  
In patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not 
significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide  
The potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was 
evaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings 
observed of relevance to human therapeutic use. 
The following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
combination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products 
alone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions 
were observed): 
▪  kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and 
▪ 
▪ 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the 
interaction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; 
slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); 
stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in a 
6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; 
▪  decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when 
hydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. 
Most of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan 
(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing 
cells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no 
relevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. 
No teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at 
doses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination 
on fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on 
fertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. 
However, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given 
alone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when 
given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
combination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not 
been evaluated in animal studies. 
Irbesartan  
There was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In 
non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in 
macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). 
At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial 
nephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and 
creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the 
hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, 
irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in 
macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the 
pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at 
oral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including 
mortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live 
foetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. 
Studies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. 
Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. 
Animal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, 
hydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, 
abortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including 
mortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. 
Hydrochlorothiazide  
Although equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental 
models, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association 
between its use and an increase in neoplasms.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of essential hypertension. 
This fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately 
controlled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
CoAprovel can be taken once daily, with or without food.  
Dose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be 
recommended. 
When clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be 
considered: 
▪  CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not 
adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; 
▪  CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by 
irbesartan 300 mg or by CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg. 
▪  CoAprovel 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by 
CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg. 
Doses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. 
When necessary, CoAprovel may be administered with another antihypertensive medicinal product 
(see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special Populations 
Renal impairment  
Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, CoAprovel is not recommended for patients with severe 
renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides in this 
population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment whose renal 
creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment  
CoAprovel is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with 
caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage adjustment of CoAprovel is necessary in 
patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Older people  
No dosage adjustment of CoAprovel is necessary in older people. 
Paediatric population  
CoAprovel is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy 
have not been established. No data are available. 
Method of Administration 
For oral use. 
4.3  Contraindications 
▪  Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to 
other sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) 
▪  Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) 
▪  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) 
▪  Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia 
▪  Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis 
▪  The concomitant use of CoAprovel with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated  in 
patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
<60 ml/min/1.73 m²) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypotension - Volume-depleted patients: CoAprovel has been rarely associated with symptomatic 
hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for hypotension. Symptomatic 
hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous 
diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected 
before initiating therapy with CoAprovel. 
Renal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and 
renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single 
functioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II 
receptor antagonists. While this is not documented with CoAprovel, a similar effect should be 
anticipated. 
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation: when CoAprovel is used in patients with impaired renal 
function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. 
There is no experience regarding the administration of CoAprovel in patients with a recent kidney 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transplantation. CoAprovel should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotaemia may occur in patients 
with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment 
whose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be 
administered with caution. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the 
concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of 
hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual 
blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or 
aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is 
considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to 
frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and 
angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic 
nephropathy. 
Hepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function 
or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate 
hepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with CoAprovel in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, 
special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Primary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to 
antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. 
Therefore, the use of CoAprovel is not recommended. 
Metabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. Latent diabetes 
mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy. Irbesartan may induce hypoglycaemia, 
particularly in diabetic patients. In patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics an appropriate blood 
glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics may be 
required when indicated (see section 4.5). 
Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; 
however at the 12.5 mg dose contained in CoAprovel, minimal or no effects were reported. 
Hyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide 
therapy. 
Electrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum 
electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. 
Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, 
hyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are 
dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, 
muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea 
or vomiting. 
Although hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with 
irbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients 
with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving 
inadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with 
corticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of CoAprovel hyperkalaemia 
might occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. 
Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts substitutes should be co-administered 
cautiously with CoAprovel (see section 4.5). 
There is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride 
deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. 
Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of 
serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia 
may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out 
tests for parathyroid function. 
Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in 
hypomagnesaemia. 
Lithium: the combination of lithium and CoAprovel is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Anti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive 
analytic result in an anti-doping test. 
General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or 
underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated 
with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any 
antihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or 
ischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. 
Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of 
allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 
Exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide 
diuretics. 
Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If 
photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-
administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the 
sun or to artificial UVA. 
Pregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. 
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be 
changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in 
pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, 
and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Choroidal effusion, Acute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs 
or sulfonamide derivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in choroidal effusion 
with visual field defect, transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. While 
hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been 
reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or 
ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure 
glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as 
rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular 
pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include 
a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8).

Excipients: 
CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg film-coated tablet contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems 
of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take 
this medicine. 
CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg film-coated tablet contains sodium. This medicine contains less than 
1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer 
An increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous 
cell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has 
been observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. 
Photosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. 
Patients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their 
skin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive 
measures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate 
protection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious 
skin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. 
The use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC 
(see also section 4.8). 
Acute Respiratory Toxicity 
Very rare severe cases of acute respiratory toxicity, including acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) have been reported after taking hydrochlorothiazide. Pulmonary oedema typically develops 
within minutes to hours after hydrochlorothiazide intake. At the onset, symptoms include dyspnoea, 
fever, pulmonary deterioration and hypotension. If diagnosis of ARDS is suspected, CoAprovel should 
be withdrawn and appropriate treatment given. Hydrochlorothiazide should not be administered to 
patients who previously experienced ARDS following hydrochlorothiazide intake. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Other antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of CoAprovel may be increased with the 
concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 
300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely administered with other 
antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers. Prior 
treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when 
initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless the volume depletion is 
corrected first (see section 4.4). 
Aliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events 
such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) 
compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Lithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects 
have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is 
reduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with CoAprovel. Therefore, the 
combination of lithium and CoAprovel is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination 
proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. 
Medicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is 
attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide 
on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with 
potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, 
carbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing 
diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products 
that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum 
potassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see 
section 4.4). 
Medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum 
potassium is recommended when CoAprovel is administered with medicinal products affected by 
serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered 
simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, 
acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect 
may occur. 
As with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an 
increased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in 
serum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should 
be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and 
consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and 
periodically thereafter. 
Repaglinide: irbesartan has the potential to inhibit OATP1B1. In a clinical study, it was reported that 
irbesartan increased the Cmax and AUC of repaglinide (substrate of OATP1B1) by 1.8-fold and 
1.3-fold, respectively, when administered 1 hour before repaglinide. In another study, no relevant 
pharmacokinetic interaction was reported, when the two drugs were co-administered. Therefore, dose 
adjustment of antidiabetic treatment such as repaglinide may be required (see section 4.4). 
Additional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan 
is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser 
extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were 
observed when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by 
CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan 
have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of 
irbesartan. 
Additional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the 
following medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: 
Alcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; 
Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic 
medicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); 
Colestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of 
anionic exchange resins. CoAprovel should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these 
medications; 
Corticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; 
Digitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favour the onset of 
digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not 
sufficiently to preclude their use; 
Nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal 
muscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; 
Antigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as 
hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or 
sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence 
of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; 
Calcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If 
calcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be 
prescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; 
Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with 
the risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If 
possible, another class of diuretics should be used; 
Other interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by 
thiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden) may increase the bioavailability of thiazide-
type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides may 
increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of 
cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their 
myelosuppressive effects. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) 
The use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The 
use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 
and 4.4). 
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors 
during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk 
cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II 
Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued 
AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative 
antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When 
pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, 
alternative therapy should be started. 
Exposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human 
foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal 
toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). 
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check 
of renal function and skull is recommended. 
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
There is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first 
trimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the 
pharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third 
trimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like 
icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. 
Hydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or 
preeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a 
beneficial effect on the course of the disease. 
Hydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare 
situations where no other treatment could be used. 
Since CoAprovel contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended during the first trimester of 
pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) 
Because no information is available regarding the use of CoAprovel during breast-feeding, CoAprovel 
is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-
feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. 
It is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its 
metabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing 
intense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of CoAprovel during breast feeding is not 
recommended. If CoAprovel is used during breast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. 
Fertility 
Irbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing 
the first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, CoAprovel is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use 
machines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that 
occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination 
Among 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients 
experienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue 
(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in 
the trials. 
Table 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled 
trials. 
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: 
very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects 
are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose 
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with CoAprovel. The patient should 
be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends 
on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of 
emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum 
electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should 
be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. 
The most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; 
bradycardia might also occur. 
Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, 
hypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most 
common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in 
muscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis 
glycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. 
Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by 
haemodialysis has not been established. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations 
ATC code: C09DA04. 
Mechanism of action 
CoAprovel is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, and a thiazide 
diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive 
effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. 
Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is 
expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source 
or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors 
results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma 
aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at 
the recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also 
degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its 
activity. 
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide 
diuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, 
directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The 
diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, 
increases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these 
diuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at 
about 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. 
The combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in 
blood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to 
300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted 
in further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 
6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an 
overall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. 
Limited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the 
300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an 
incremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). 
Once daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic 
mean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg 
in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg 
hydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours 
period with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When 
measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of 
CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff during office 
visits were 68% and 76% for CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg and CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg, 
respectively. These 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak 
and are consistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. 
In patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan 
gave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. 
The blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent 
after the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by 6-
8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained 
for over one year. Although not specifically studied with the CoAprovel, rebound hypertension has not 
been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. 
The effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has 
not been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with 
hydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. 
There is no difference in response to CoAprovel, regardless of age or gender. As is the case with other 
medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably 
less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low 
dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients 
approaches that of non-black patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Efficacy and safety of CoAprovel as initial therapy for severe hypertension (defined as SeDBP 
≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 8-week, 
parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-
titrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, 
and just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were 
hyperlipidaemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of 
the participants. 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was 
controlled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on 
the combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan 
(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment 
group and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). 
The types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were 
similar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, 
there were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients 
with hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the 
combination and monotherapy groups, respectively. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in 
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs 
Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an 
angiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of 
end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
diabetic nephropathy. 
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and 
mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as 
compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these 
results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in 
patients with diabetic nephropathy. 
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) 
was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor 
or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney 
disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk 
of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the 
aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest 
(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren 
group than in the placebo group. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer:  
Based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between 
HCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of 
BCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. 
High HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-
1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship 
was observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer 
(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, 
using a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an 
adjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR 
7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4).

Concomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. 
Absorption 
Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for 
their activity. Following oral administration of CoAprovel, the absolute oral bioavailability is 60-80% 
and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does not affect the 
bioavailability of CoAprovel. Peak plasma concentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral 
administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood 
components. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% 
protein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Irbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. 
A less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the 
mechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, 
respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma 
concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited 
accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, 
somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. 
However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage 
adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat 
greater in older subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal 
half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in older people. The mean 
plasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. 
Biotransformation 
Following oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma 
radioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via 
glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide 
(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the 
cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  
Elimination 
Irbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or 
intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, 
and the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged 
irbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least 
61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the 
placental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. 
Renal impairment  
In patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters 
of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to 
increase to 21 hours. 
Hepatic impairment  
In patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not 
significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
The potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was 
evaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings 
observed of relevance to human therapeutic use. 
The following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
combination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products 
alone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions 
were observed): 
▪  kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and 
▪ 
▪ 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the 
interaction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; 
slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); 
stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in a 
6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; 
▪  decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when 
hydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. 
Most of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan 
(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing 
cells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no 
relevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. 
No teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at 
doses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination 
on fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on 
fertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. 
However, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given 
alone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when 
given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
combination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not 
been evaluated in animal studies. 
Irbesartan 
There was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In 
non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in 
macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). 
At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial 
nephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and 
creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the 
hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, 
irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the 
pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. 
Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at 
oral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including 
mortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live 
foetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. 
Studies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. 
Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. 
Animal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, 
hydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, 
abortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including 
mortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Although equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental 
models, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association 
between its use and an increase in neoplasms.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of essential hypertension. 
This fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately 
controlled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
CoAprovel can be taken once daily, with or without food.  
Dose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be 
recommended. 
When clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be 
considered: 
▪  CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not 
adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; 
▪  CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by 
irbesartan 300 mg or by CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg. 
▪  CoAprovel 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by 
CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg. 
Doses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. 
When necessary, CoAprovel may be administered with another antihypertensive medicinal product 
(see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1).

Special Populations 
Renal impairment  
Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, CoAprovel is not recommended for patients with severe 
renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides in this 
population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment whose renal 
creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
CoAprovel is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with 
caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage adjustment of CoAprovel is necessary in 
patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Older people 
No dosage adjustment of CoAprovel is necessary in older people. 
Paediatric population 
CoAprovel is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy 
have not been established. No data are available. 
Method of Administration 
For oral use. 
4.3  Contraindications 
▪  Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to 
other sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) 
▪  Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) 
▪  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) 
▪  Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia 
▪  Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis 
▪  The concomitant use of CoAprovel with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in 
patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
<60 ml/min/1.73 m²) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypotension - Volume-depleted patients: CoAprovel has been rarely associated with symptomatic 
hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for hypotension. Symptomatic 
hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous 
diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected 
before initiating therapy with CoAprovel. 
Renal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and 
renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single 
functioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II 
receptor antagonists. While this is not documented with CoAprovel, a similar effect should be 
anticipated. 
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation: when CoAprovel is used in patients with impaired renal 
function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. 
There is no experience regarding the administration of CoAprovel in patients with a recent kidney 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transplantation. CoAprovel should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotaemia may occur in patients 
with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment 
whose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be 
administered with caution. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the 
concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of 
hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual 
blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or 
aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is 
considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to 
frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and 
angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic 
nephropathy. 
Hepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function 
or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate 
hepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with CoAprovel in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, 
special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Primary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to 
antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. 
Therefore, the use of CoAprovel is not recommended. 
Metabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. Latent diabetes 
mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy. Irbesartan may induce hypoglycaemia, 
particularly in diabetic patients. In patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics an appropriate blood 
glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics may be 
required when indicated (see section 4.5). 
Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; 
however at the 12.5 mg dose contained in CoAprovel, minimal or no effects were reported. 
Hyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide 
therapy. 
Electrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum 
electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. 
Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, 
hyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are 
dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, 
muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea 
or vomiting. 
Although hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with 
irbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients 
with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving 
inadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with 
corticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of CoAprovel hyperkalaemia 
might occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. 
Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts substitutes should be co-administered 
cautiously with CoAprovel (see section 4.5). 
There is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride 
deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. 
Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of 
serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia 
may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out 
tests for parathyroid function. 
Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in 
hypomagnesaemia. 
Lithium: the combination of lithium and CoAprovel is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Anti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive 
analytic result in an anti-doping test. 
General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or 
underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated 
with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any 
antihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or 
ischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. 
Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of 
allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 
Exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide 
diuretics. 
Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If 
photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-
administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the 
sun or to artificial UVA. 
Pregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. 
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be 
changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in 
pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, 
and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Choroidal effusion, Acute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs 
or sulfonamide derivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in choroidal effusion 
with visual field defect, transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. While 
hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been 
reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or 
ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure 
glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as 
rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular 
pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include 
a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8).

Excipients: 
CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg film-coated tablet contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems 
of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take 
this medicine. 
CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg film-coated tablet contains sodium. This medicine contains less than 
1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer 
An increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous 
cell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has 
been observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. 
Photosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. 
Patients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their 
skin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive 
measures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate 
protection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious 
skin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. 
The use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC 
(see also section 4.8). 
Acute Respiratory Toxicity 
Very rare severe cases of acute respiratory toxicity, including acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) have been reported after taking hydrochlorothiazide. Pulmonary oedema typically develops 
within minutes to hours after hydrochlorothiazide intake. At the onset, symptoms include dyspnoea, 
fever, pulmonary deterioration and hypotension. If diagnosis of ARDS is suspected, CoAprovel should 
be withdrawn and appropriate treatment given. Hydrochlorothiazide should not be administered to 
patients who previously experienced ARDS following hydrochlorothiazide intake. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Other antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of CoAprovel may be increased with the 
concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 
300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely administered with other 
antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers. Prior 
treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when 
initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless the volume depletion is 
corrected first (see section 4.4). 
Aliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events 
such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) 
compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Lithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects 
have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is 
reduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with CoAprovel. Therefore, the 
combination of lithium and CoAprovel is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination 
proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. 
Medicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is 
attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide 
on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with 
potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, 
carbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing 
diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products 
that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum 
potassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see 
section 4.4). 
Medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum 
potassium is recommended when CoAprovel is administered with medicinal products affected by 
serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered 
simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, 
acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect 
may occur. 
As with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an 
increased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in 
serum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should 
be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and 
consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and 
periodically thereafter. 
Repaglinide: irbesartan has the potential to inhibit OATP1B1. In a clinical study, it was reported that 
irbesartan increased the Cmax and AUC of repaglinide (substrate of OATP1B1) by 1.8-fold and 
1.3-fold, respectively, when administered 1 hour before repaglinide. In another study, no relevant 
pharmacokinetic interaction was reported, when the two drugs were co-administered. Therefore, dose 
adjustment of antidiabetic treatment such as repaglinide may be required (see section 4.4). 
Additional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan 
is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser 
extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were 
observed when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by 
CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan 
have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of 
irbesartan. 
Additional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the 
following medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: 
Alcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; 
Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic 
medicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); 
Colestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of 
anionic exchange resins. CoAprovel should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these 
medications; 
Corticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; 
Digitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favour the onset of 
digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not 
sufficiently to preclude their use; 
Nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal 
muscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; 
Antigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as 
hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or 
sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence 
of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; 
Calcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If 
calcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be 
prescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; 
Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with 
the risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If 
possible, another class of diuretics should be used; 
Other interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by 
thiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden) may increase the bioavailability of thiazide-
type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides may 
increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of 
cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their 
myelosuppressive effects. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) 
The use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The 
use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 
and 4.4). 
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors 
during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk 
cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II 
Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued 
AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative 
antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When 
pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, 
alternative therapy should be started. 
Exposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human 
foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal 
toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). 
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check 
of renal function and skull is recommended. 
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
There is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first 
trimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the 
pharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third 
trimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like 
icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. 
Hydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or 
preeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a 
beneficial effect on the course of the disease. 
Hydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare 
situations where no other treatment could be used. 
Since CoAprovel contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended during the first trimester of 
pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) 
Because no information is available regarding the use of CoAprovel during breast-feeding, CoAprovel 
is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-
feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. 
It is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its 
metabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing 
intense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of CoAprovel during breast feeding is not 
recommended. If CoAprovel is used during breast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. 
Fertility 
Irbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing 
the first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, CoAprovel is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use 
machines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that 
occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination 
Among 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients 
experienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue 
(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose 
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with CoAprovel. The patient should 
be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends 
on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of 
emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum 
electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should 
be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. 
The most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; 
bradycardia might also occur. 
Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, 
hypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most 
common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in 
muscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis 
glycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. 
Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by 
haemodialysis has not been established. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations 
ATC code: C09DA04. 
Mechanism of action 
CoAprovel is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, and a thiazide 
diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive 
effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. 
Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is 
expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source 
or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors 
results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma 
aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at 
the recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also 
degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its 
activity. 
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide 
diuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, 
directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The 
diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, 
increases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these 
diuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at 
about 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. 
The combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in 
blood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to 
300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted 
in further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 
6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an 
overall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. 
Limited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the 
300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an 
incremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). 
Once daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic 
mean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg 
in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg 
hydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours 
period with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When 
measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of 
CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff during office 
visits were 68% and 76% for CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg and CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg, 
respectively. These 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak 
and are consistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. 
In patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan 
gave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. 
The blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent 
after the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by 
6-8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained 
for over one year. Although not specifically studied with the CoAprovel, rebound hypertension has not 
been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. 
The effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has 
not been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with 
hydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. 
There is no difference in response to CoAprovel, regardless of age or gender. As is the case with other 
medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably 
less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low 
dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients 
approaches that of non-black patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Efficacy and safety of CoAprovel as initial therapy for severe hypertension (defined as SeDBP 
≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 8-week, 
parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-
titrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, 
and just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were 
hyperlipidaemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of 
the participants. 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was 
controlled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on 
the combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan 
(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment 
group and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). 
The types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were 
similar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, 
there were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients 
with hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the 
combination and monotherapy groups, respectively. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in 
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs 
Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an 
angiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of 
end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
diabetic nephropathy. 
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and 
mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as 
compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these 
results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in 
patients with diabetic nephropathy. 
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) 
was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor 
or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney 
disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk 
of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the 
aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest 
(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren 
group than in the placebo group. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer:  
Based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between 
HCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of 
BCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. 
High HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 
1.23-1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response 
relationship was observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association 
between lip cancer (SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 
population controls, using a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was 
demonstrated with an adjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use 
(~25,000 mg) and OR 7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 
4.4). 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Concomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. 
Absorption  
Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for 
their activity. Following oral administration of CoAprovel, the absolute oral bioavailability is 60-80% 
and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does not affect the 
bioavailability of CoAprovel. Peak plasma concentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral 
administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood 
components. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% 
protein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Irbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. 
A less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the 
mechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, 
respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma 
concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited 
accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, 
somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. 
However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage 
adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat 
greater in older subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal 
half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in older people. The mean 
plasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. 
Biotransformation 
Following oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma 
radioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via 
glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide 
(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the 
cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  
Elimination 
Irbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or 
intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, 
and the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged 
irbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least 
61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the 
placental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters 
of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with 
creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to 
increase to 21 hours. 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not 
significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
The potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was 
evaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings 
observed of relevance to human therapeutic use. 
The following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
combination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products 
alone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions 
were observed): 
▪  kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and 
▪ 
▪ 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the 
interaction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; 
slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); 
stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in a 
6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; 
▪  decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when 
hydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. 
Most of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan 
(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing 
cells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no 
relevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. 
No teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at 
doses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination 
on fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on 
fertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. 
However, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given 
alone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when 
given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
combination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not 
been evaluated in animal studies. 
Irbesartan 
There was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In 
non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in 
macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). 
At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial 
nephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and 
creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the 
hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, 
irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in 
macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. 
Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at 
oral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including 
mortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live 
foetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. 
Studies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. 
Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. 
Animal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, 
hydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, 
abortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including 
mortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Although equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental 
models, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association 
between its use and an increase in neoplasms.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of essential hypertension. 
This fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately 
controlled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
CoAprovel can be taken once daily, with or without food.  
Dose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be 
recommended. 
When clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be 
considered: 
▪  CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not 
adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; 
▪  CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by 
irbesartan 300 mg or by CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg. 
▪  CoAprovel 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by 
CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg. 
Doses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. 
When necessary, CoAprovel may be administered with another antihypertensive medicinal product 
(see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1).

Special Populations 
Renal impairment 
Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, CoAprovel is not recommended for patients with severe 
renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides in this 
population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment whose renal 
creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
CoAprovel is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with 
caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage adjustment of CoAprovel is necessary in 
patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Older people 
No dosage adjustment of CoAprovel is necessary in older people. 
Paediatric population 
CoAprovel is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy 
have not been established. No data are available. 
Method of Administration 
For oral use. 
4.3  Contraindications 
▪  Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to 
other sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) 
▪  Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) 
▪  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) 
▪  Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia 
▪  Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis 
▪  The concomitant use of CoAprovel with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in 
patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
<60 ml/min/1.73 m²) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypotension - Volume-depleted patients: CoAprovel has been rarely associated with symptomatic 
hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for hypotension. Symptomatic 
hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous 
diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected 
before initiating therapy with CoAprovel. 
Renal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and 
renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single 
functioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II 
receptor antagonists. While this is not documented with CoAprovel, a similar effect should be 
anticipated. 
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation: when CoAprovel is used in patients with impaired renal 
function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. 
There is no experience regarding the administration of CoAprovel in patients with a recent kidney 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transplantation. CoAprovel should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotaemia may occur in patients 
with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment 
whose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be 
administered with caution. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the 
concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of 
hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual 
blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or 
aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is 
considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to 
frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and 
angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic 
nephropathy. 
Hepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function 
or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate 
hepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with CoAprovel in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, 
special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Primary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to 
antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. 
Therefore, the use of CoAprovel is not recommended. 
Metabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. Latent diabetes 
mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy. Irbesartan may induce hypoglycaemia, 
particularly in diabetic patients. In patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics an appropriate blood 
glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics may be 
required when indicated (see section 4.5). 
Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; 
however at the 12.5 mg dose contained in CoAprovel, minimal or no effects were reported. 
Hyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide 
therapy. 
Electrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum 
electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. 
Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, 
hyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are 
dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, 
muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea 
or vomiting. 
Although hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with 
irbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients 
with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving 
inadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with 
corticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of CoAprovel hyperkalaemia 
might occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. 
Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts substitutes should be co-administered 
cautiously with CoAprovel (see section 4.5). 
There is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride 
deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. 
Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of 
serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia 
may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out 
tests for parathyroid function. 
Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in 
hypomagnesaemia. 
Lithium: the combination of lithium and CoAprovel is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Anti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive 
analytic result in an anti-doping test. 
General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or 
underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated 
with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any 
antihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or 
ischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. 
Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of 
allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 
Exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide 
diuretics. 
Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If 
photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-
administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the 
sun or to artificial UVA. 
Pregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. 
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be 
changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in 
pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, 
and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Choroidal effusion, Acute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs 
or sulfonamide derivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in choroidal effusion 
with visual field defect, transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. While 
hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been 
reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or 
ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure 
glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as 
rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular 
pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include 
a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8).

Excipients: 
CoAprovel 300 mg/25 mg film-coated tablet contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems 
of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take 
this medicine. 
CoAprovel 300 mg/25 mg film-coated tablet contains sodium. This medicine contains less than 
1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer 
An increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous 
cell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has 
been observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. 
Photosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. 
Patients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their 
skin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive 
measures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate 
protection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious 
skin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. 
The use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC 
(see also section 4.8). 
Acute Respiratory Toxicity 
Very rare severe cases of acute respiratory toxicity, including acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) have been reported after taking hydrochlorothiazide. Pulmonary oedema typically develops 
within minutes to hours after hydrochlorothiazide intake. At the onset, symptoms include dyspnoea, 
fever, pulmonary deterioration and hypotension. If diagnosis of ARDS is suspected, CoAprovel should 
be withdrawn and appropriate treatment given. Hydrochlorothiazide should not be administered to 
patients who previously experienced ARDS following hydrochlorothiazide intake. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Other antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of CoAprovel may be increased with the 
concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 
300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely administered with other 
antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers. Prior 
treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when 
initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless the volume depletion is 
corrected first (see section 4.4). 
Aliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events 
such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) 
compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Lithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects 
have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is 
reduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with CoAprovel. Therefore, the 
combination of lithium and CoAprovel is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination 
proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. 
Medicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is 
attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide 
on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with 
potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, 
carbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing 
diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products 
that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum 
potassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see 
section 4.4). 
Medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum 
potassium is recommended when CoAprovel is administered with medicinal products affected by 
serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered 
simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, 
acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect 
may occur. 
As with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an 
increased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in 
serum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should 
be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and 
consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and 
periodically thereafter. 
Repaglinide: irbesartan has the potential to inhibit OATP1B1. In a clinical study, it was reported that 
irbesartan increased the Cmax and AUC of repaglinide (substrate of OATP1B1) by 1.8-fold and 
1.3-fold, respectively, when administered 1 hour before repaglinide. In another study, no relevant 
pharmacokinetic interaction was reported, when the two drugs were co-administered. Therefore, dose 
adjustment of antidiabetic treatment such as repaglinide may be required (see section 4.4). 
Additional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan 
is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser 
extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were 
observed when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by 
CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan 
have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of 
irbesartan. 
Additional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the 
following medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: 
Alcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; 
Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic 
medicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); 
Colestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of 
anionic exchange resins. CoAprovel should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these 
medications; 
Corticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; 
Digitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favour the onset of 
digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not 
sufficiently to preclude their use; 
Nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal 
muscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; 
Antigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as 
hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or 
sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence 
of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; 
Calcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If 
calcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be 
prescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; 
Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with 
the risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If 
possible, another class of diuretics should be used; 
Other interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by 
thiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden) may increase the bioavailability of thiazide-
type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides may 
increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of 
cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their 
myelosuppressive effects. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) 
The use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The 
use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 
and 4.4). 
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors 
during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk 
cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II 
Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued 
AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative 
antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When 
pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, 
alternative therapy should be started. 
Exposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human 
foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal 
toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). 
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check 
of renal function and skull is recommended. 
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
There is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first 
trimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the 
pharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third 
trimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like 
icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. 
Hydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or 
preeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a 
beneficial effect on the course of the disease. 
Hydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare 
situations where no other treatment could be used. 
Since CoAprovel contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended during the first trimester of 
pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) 
Because no information is available regarding the use of CoAprovel during breast-feeding, CoAprovel 
is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-
feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. 
It is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its 
metabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing 
intense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of CoAprovel during breast feeding is not 
recommended. If CoAprovel is used during breast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. 
Fertility 
Irbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing 
the first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, CoAprovel is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use 
machines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that 
occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination 
Among 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients 
experienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue 
(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose 
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with CoAprovel. The patient should 
be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends 
on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of 
emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum 
electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should 
be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. 
The most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; 
bradycardia might also occur. 
Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, 
hypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most 
common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in 
muscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis 
glycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. 
Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by 
haemodialysis has not been established.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations 
ATC code: C09DA04. 
Mechanism of action 
CoAprovel is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, and a thiazide 
diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive 
effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. 
Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is 
expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source 
or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors 
results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma 
aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at 
the recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also 
degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its 
activity. 
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide 
diuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, 
directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The 
diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, 
increases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these 
diuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at 
about 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. 
The combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in 
blood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to 
300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted 
in further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 
6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an 
overall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. 
Limited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the 
300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an 
incremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). 
Once daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic 
mean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg 
in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg 
hydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours 
period with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When 
measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of 
CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff during office 
visits were 68% and 76% for CoAprovel 150 mg/12.5 mg and CoAprovel 300 mg/12.5 mg, 
respectively. These 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak 
and are consistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. 
In patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan 
gave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. 
The blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent 
after the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by 6-
8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained 
for over one year. Although not specifically studied with the CoAprovel, rebound hypertension has not 
been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. 
The effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has 
not been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with 
hydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. 
There is no difference in response to CoAprovel, regardless of age or gender. As is the case with other 
medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably 
less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low 
dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients 
approaches that of non-black patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Efficacy and safety of CoAprovel as initial therapy for severe hypertension (defined as SeDBP 
≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 8-week, 
parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-
titrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, 
and just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were 
hyperlipidaemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of 
the participants. 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was 
controlled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on 
the combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan 
(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment 
group and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). 
The types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were 
similar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, 
there were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients 
with hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the 
combination and monotherapy groups, respectively. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in 
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs 
Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an 
angiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of 
end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
diabetic nephropathy. 
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and 
mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as 
compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these 
results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in 
patients with diabetic nephropathy. 
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) 
was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor 
or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney 
disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk 
of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the 
aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest 
(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren 
group than in the placebo group. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer:  
Based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between 
HCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of 
BCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. 
High HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-
1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship 
was observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer 
(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, 
using a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an 
adjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR 
7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). 
82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Concomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. 
Absorption 
Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for 
their activity. Following oral administration of CoAprovel, the absolute oral bioavailability is 60-80% 
and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does not affect the 
bioavailability of CoAprovel. Peak plasma concentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral 
administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood 
components. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% 
protein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Irbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. 
A less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the 
mechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, 
respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma 
concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited 
accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, 
somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. 
However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage 
adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat 
greater in older subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal 
half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in older people. The mean 
plasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. 
Biotransformation 
Following oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma 
radioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via 
glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide 
(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the 
cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  
Elimination 
Irbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or 
intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, 
and the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged 
irbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least 
61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the 
placental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters 
of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with 
creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to 
increase to 21 hours. 
83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not 
significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
The potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was 
evaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings 
observed of relevance to human therapeutic use. 
The following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
combination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products 
alone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions 
were observed): 
▪  kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and 
▪ 
▪ 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the 
interaction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; 
slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); 
stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in a 
6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; 
▪  decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when 
hydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. 
Most of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan 
(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing 
cells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no 
relevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. 
No teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at 
doses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination 
on fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on 
fertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. 
However, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given 
alone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when 
given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
combination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not 
been evaluated in animal studies. 
Irbesartan 
There was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In 
non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in 
macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). 
At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial 
nephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and 
creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the 
hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, 
irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in 
macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the 
84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. 
Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at 
oral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including 
mortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live 
foetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. 
Studies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. 
Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. 
Animal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, 
hydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, 
abortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including 
mortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. 
Hydrochlorothiazide 
Although equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental 
models, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association 
between its use and an increase in neoplasms.

▪  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
▪ 
▪  This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What CoAprovel is and what it is used for 
CoAprovel is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. 
Irbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-
II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing them to tighten. 
This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of angiotensin-II to these 
receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. 
Hydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased 
urine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. 
The two active ingredients in CoAprovel work together to lower blood pressure further than if either 
was given alone. 
CoAprovel is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with irbesartan or 
hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. 
2.  What you need to know before you take CoAprovel 
Do not take CoAprovel 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you are allergic  to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines 
if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid CoAprovel in early pregnancy 
– see pregnancy section) 
if you have severe liver or kidney problems 
if you have difficulty in producing urine 
if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in 
your blood 
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with  a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren. 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking CoAprovel and if any of the following apply to you: 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea 
if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant 
if you suffer from heart problems 
110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
if you suffer from liver problems 
if you suffer from diabetes 
if you develop low blood sugar levels (symptoms may include sweating, weakness, hunger, 
dizziness, trembling, headache, flushing or paleness, numbness, having a fast, pounding heart 
beat), particularly if you are being treated for diabetes. 
if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) 
if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the 
hormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood 
pressure). 
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: 
o  an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems. 
o  aliskiren. 
if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. 
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the 
risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin from sun 
exposure and UV rays while taking CoAprovel 
if you experienced breathing or lung problems (including inflammation or fluid in the lungs) 
following hydrochlorothiazide intake in the past. If you develop any severe shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing after taking CoAprovel, seek medical attention immediately. 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. 
See also information under the heading “Do not take CoAprovel”. 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. CoAprovel is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). 
▪ 
You should also tell your doctor: 
▪ 
if you are on a low-salt diet 
▪ 
if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle 
pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an 
excessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in CoAprovel) 
if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn (such 
as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal 
if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics 
if you have decrease in your vision or pain in one or both of your eyes while taking CoAprovel. 
These could be symptoms of fluid accumulation in the vascular layer of the eye (choroidal 
effusion) or an increase of pressure in your eye (glaucoma) and can happen within hours to 
a week of taking CoAprovel. This can lead to permanent vision loss, if not treated. If you 
earlier have had a penicillin or sulfonamide allergy, you can be at higher risk of 
developing this. You should discontinue CoAprovel treatment and seek prompt medical 
attention. 
▪ 
▪ 
The hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping 
test. 
Children and adolescents 
CoAprovel should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). 
Other medicines and CoAprovel 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Diuretic agents such as the hydrochlorothiazide contained in CoAprovel may have an effect on other 
medicines. Preparations containing lithium should not be taken with CoAprovel without close 
supervision by your doctor. 
Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions:  
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take 
CoAprovel” and “Warnings and precautions”).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What CoAprovel is and what it is used for 
CoAprovel is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. 
Irbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-
II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing them to tighten. 
This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of angiotensin-II to these 
receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. 
Hydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased 
urine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. 
The two active ingredients in CoAprovel work together to lower blood pressure further than if either 
was given alone. 
CoAprovel is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with irbesartan or 
hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. 
2.  What you need to know before you take CoAprovel 
Do not take CoAprovel 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you are allergic to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines 
if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid CoAprovel in early pregnancy 
– see pregnancy section) 
if you have severe liver or kidney problems 
if you have difficulty in producing urine 
if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in your 
blood 
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren.

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking CoAprovel and if any of the following apply to you: 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea 
if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant 
if you suffer from heart problems 
118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
if you suffer from liver problems 
if you suffer from diabetes 
if you develop low blood sugar levels (symptoms may include sweating, weakness, hunger, 
dizziness, trembling, headache, flushing or paleness, numbness, having a fast, pounding heart 
beat), particularly if you are being treated for diabetes. 
if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) 
if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the 
hormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood 
pressure). 
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: 
o  an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems. 
o  aliskiren. 
if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. 
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the 
risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin from sun 
exposure and UV rays while taking CoAprovel 
if you experienced breathing or lung problems (including inflammation or fluid in the lungs) 
following hydrochlorothiazide intake in the past. If you develop any severe shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing after taking CoAprovel, seek medical attention immediately. 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. 
See also information under the heading “Do not take CoAprovel”. 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. CoAprovel is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). 
▪ 
You should also tell your doctor: 
▪ 
if you are on a low-salt diet 
▪ 
if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle 
pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an 
excessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in CoAprovel) 
if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn (such 
as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal 
if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics 
if you have decrease in your vision or pain in one or both of your eyes while taking CoAprovel. 
These could be symptoms of fluid accumulation in the vascular layer of the eye (choroidal 
effusion) or an increase of pressure in your eye (glaucoma) and can happen within hours to 
a week of taking CoAprovel. This can lead to permanent vision loss, if not treated. If you 
earlier have had a penicillin or sulfonamide allergy, you can be at higher risk of 
developing this. You should discontinue CoAprovel treatment and seek prompt medical 
attention. 
▪ 
▪ 
The hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping 
test.

supervision by your doctor. 
Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions:  
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take 
CoAprovel” and “Warnings and precautions”).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What CoAprovel is and what it is used for 
CoAprovel is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. 
Irbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-
II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing them to tighten. 
This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of angiotensin-II to these 
receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. 
Hydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased 
urine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. 
The two active ingredients in CoAprovel work together to lower blood pressure further than if either 
was given alone. 
CoAprovel is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with irbesartan or 
hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. 
2.  What you need to know before you take CoAprovel 
Do not take CoAprovel 
▪

▪ 
if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you are allergic to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines 
if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid CoAprovel in early pregnancy 
– see pregnancy section) 
if you have severe liver or kidney problems 
if you have difficulty in producing urine 
if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in your 
blood 
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren.

aliskiren. 
if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. 
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the 
risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin from sun 
exposure and UV rays while taking CoAprovel 
if you experienced breathing or lung problems (including inflammation or fluid in the lungs) 
following hydrochlorothiazide intake in the past. If you develop any severe shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing after taking CoAprovel, seek medical attention immediately. 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. 
See also information under the heading “Do not take CoAprovel”. 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. CoAprovel is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). 
▪ 
You should also tell your doctor: 
▪ 
if you are on a low-salt diet 
▪ 
if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle 
pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an 
excessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in CoAprovel) 
if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn (such 
as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal 
if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics  
if you have decrease in your vision or pain in one or both of your eyes while taking CoAprovel. 
These could be symptoms of fluid accumulation in the vascular layer of the eye (choroidal 
effusion) or an increase of pressure in your eye (glaucoma) and can happen within hours to 
a week of taking CoAprovel. This can lead to permanent vision loss, if not treated. If you 
earlier have had a penicillin or sulfonamide allergy, you can be at higher risk of 
developing this. You should discontinue CoAprovel treatment and seek prompt medical 
attention. 
▪ 
▪ 
The hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping 
test.

medicines. Preparations containing lithium should not be taken with CoAprovel without close 
supervision by your doctor. 
Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions:

CoAprovel can be taken with or without food. 
Due to the hydrochlorothiazide contained in CoAprovel, if you drink alcohol while on treatment with 
this medicine, you may have an increased feeling of dizziness on standing up, specially when getting 
up from a sitting position. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking CoAprovel before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of CoAprovel. CoAprovel is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may 
cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. CoAprovel is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. 
Driving and using machines 
CoAprovel is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally dizziness 
or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, talk to your 
doctor before attempting to drive or use machines. 
CoAprovel contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to 
some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. 
CoAprovel contains sodium. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, 
that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3. 
How to take CoAprovel 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist

Method of administration 
CoAprovel is for oral use. Swallow the tablets with a sufficient amount of fluid (e.g. one glass of 
water). You can take CoAprovel with or without food. Try to take your daily dose at about the same 
time each day. It is important that you continue to take CoAprovel until your doctor tells you 
otherwise. 
The maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 6-8 weeks after beginning treatment. 
If you take more CoAprovel than you should 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor immediately. 
Children should not take CoAprovel 
CoAprovel should not be given to children under 18 years of age. If a child swallows some tablets,

make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What CoAprovel is and what it is used for 
CoAprovel is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. 
Irbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-
II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing them to tighten. 
This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of angiotensin-II to these 
receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. 
Hydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased 
urine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. 
The two active ingredients in CoAprovel work together to lower blood pressure further than if either 
was given alone. 
CoAprovel is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with irbesartan or 
hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure.

if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. 
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the 
risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin from sun 
exposure and UV rays while taking CoAprovel 
if you experienced breathing or lung problems (including inflammation or fluid in the lungs) 
following hydrochlorothiazide intake in the past. If you develop any severe shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing after taking CoAprovel, seek medical attention immediately. 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. 
See also information under the heading “Do not take CoAprovel”. 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. CoAprovel is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). 
▪ 
You should also tell your doctor: 
▪ 
if you are on a low-salt diet 
▪ 
if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle 
pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an 
excessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in CoAprovel)

These could be symptoms of fluid accumulation in the vascular layer of the eye (choroidal 
effusion) or an increase of pressure in your eye (glaucoma) and can happen within hours to 
a week of taking CoAprovel. This can lead to permanent vision loss, if not treated. If you 
earlier have had a penicillin or sulfonamide allergy, you can be at higher risk of 
developing this. You should discontinue CoAprovel treatment and seek prompt medical 
attention.

Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking CoAprovel before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of CoAprovel. CoAprovel is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may 
cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. CoAprovel is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.

CoAprovel is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally dizziness 
or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, talk to your 
doctor before attempting to drive or use machines.

3. 
How to take CoAprovel 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
Dosage 
The recommended dose of CoAprovel is one tablet a day. CoAprovel will usually be prescribed by 
your doctor when your previous treatment did not reduce your blood pressure enough. Your doctor 
will instruct you how to switch from the previous treatment to CoAprovel. 
Method of administration 
CoAprovel is for oral use. Swallow the tablets with a sufficient amount of fluid (e.g. one glass of 
water). You can take CoAprovel with or without food. Try to take your daily dose at about the same 
time each day. It is important that you continue to take CoAprovel until your doctor tells you 
otherwise. 
The maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 6-8 weeks after beginning treatment. 
If you take more CoAprovel than you should 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor immediately. 
Children should not take CoAprovel 
CoAprovel should not be given to children under 18 years of age. If a child swallows some tablets, 
contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to take CoAprovel 
If you accidentally miss a daily dose, just take the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

CoAprovel is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking CoAprovel before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of CoAprovel. CoAprovel is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may 
cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. CoAprovel is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. 
Driving and using machines 
CoAprovel is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally dizziness 
or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, talk to your 
doctor before attempting to drive or use machines. 
CoAprovel contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to 
some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. 
CoAprovel contains sodium. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, 
that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

How to take CoAprovel 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
Dosage

your doctor when your previous treatment did not reduce your blood pressure enough. Your doctor 
will instruct you how to switch from the previous treatment to CoAprovel. 
Method of administration 
CoAprovel is for oral use. Swallow the tablets with a sufficient amount of fluid (e.g. one glass of 
water). You can take CoAprovel with or without food. Try to take your daily dose at about the same 
time each day. It is important that you continue to take CoAprovel until your doctor tells you 
otherwise. 
The maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 6-8 weeks after beginning treatment. 
If you take more CoAprovel than you should 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor immediately. 
Children should not take CoAprovel 
CoAprovel should not be given to children under 18 years of age. If a child swallows some tablets, 
contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to take CoAprovel 
If you accidentally miss a daily dose, just take the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for sodium oxybate (oral use), the 
scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
During the reporting interval, 24 cases (non-serious) of nocturia with a cumulative of 321 cases (4 
serious) were reported. There were 8 medically confirmed cases reporting nocturia with compatible 
chronology and/or positive dechallenge and/or positive rechallenge. Among them, there were 6 cases 
with compatible chronology ranging from 1 day to 30 days, including 2 of them with a reported positive 
dechallenge.  
Based on an overall review and assessment of the safety data and considering the number of cases 
demonstrating potential temporal association of the event of nocturia, relevant dechallenge and 
rechallenge with sodium oxybate, and possible biological plausibility increased fluid intake due to salt 
content and solute diuresis from salt load, the PRAC considered that a causal relationship between the 
use of sodium oxybate and the occurrence of nocturia could not be excluded. Therefore, the product 
information of sodium oxybate (oral use) containing products should be updated to include ‘nocturia’ 
with a frequency not known in section 4.8 of the SmPC and in the package leaflet. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing sodium oxybate (oral use) were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for sodium oxybate (oral use) the CHMP is of the opinion that 
the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing sodium oxybate (oral use) is unchanged 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis worldwide and despite early 
treatment with antibiotics, morbidity and mortality rates are high. 
Based on antigenic differences in their capsular polysaccharide, 13 serogroups of N meningitidis have 
been identified. Serogroups A, B, C, W-135, and Y are being responsible for the large majority of 
invasive meningococcal infections worldwide. 
The MAH has developed a conjugate vaccine Menveo (referred to as MenACWY throughout this 
document), containing bacterial capsular oligosaccharides for serogroups A, C, W and Y, conjugated to 
a protein carrier CRM-197 (a non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin). 
The MenACWY vaccine is licensed in Europe for use in children aged 2 years and above, and approved 
in more than 63 countries worldwide, and approximately 30,000 subjects have been exposed to 
MenACWY in completed clinical trials.

Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objectives 
1. To demonstrate a sufficient immune response of four doses of MenACWY given to infants at 2, 4, 6 
and 12 months of age as measured by the percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal activity using 
human complement (hSBA) ≥ 1:8, directed againstN. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y. 
2. To demonstrate immunological non-inferiority of two MenACWY infant doses and a toddler dose 
(doses at 2, 4 and 12 months of age) to three infant doses and a toddler dose (doses at 2, 4, 6 and 12 
months of age) as measured by percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 against N. meningitidis 
serogroups C, W and Y at 13 months of age. 
Secondary objectives included evaluation of the effect of concomitant administration of MenACWY on 
immune response to PCV-13 antigens after 2 or 3 doses of MenACWY (measured at 7 months of age), 
and after 3 or 4 doses (measured at 13 months of age), using a noninferiority test.  
Secondary objectives also included assessment of the kinetics of immune response following the 
first, second and third infant doses (measured at 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 12 months of age). 
Safety Objectives: 
1. To assess the percentage of subjects presenting, during days 1-7 after any vaccination, at least one 
severe systemic reaction after administration of MenACWY with concomitant vaccines vs. concomitant 
vaccines alone. 
2. To assess the safety and tolerability of MenACWY when given concomitantly with routine infant 
vaccines. 
Study design 
This was a phase 3b, open-label, randomized, multicenter study. The study assessed the 
immunogenicity of a 3-dose vaccination schedule of MenACWY vaccine (2 infant doses at 2 and 4 
months of age followed by a toddler dose at 12 months of age) compared to a 4-dose vaccination 
schedule (3 infant doses at 2, 4 and 6 months of age followed by a toddler dose at 12 months of age). 
Study population /Sample size 
Individuals were healthy 2-month-old infants (≥55 to ≤89 days old). Babies must have been born after 
a full-term pregnancy with an estimated gestational age ≥37 weeks and a birth weight ≥2.5 kg. 
Main exclusion criteria were: prior receiving of any meningococcal vaccine or any vaccine against DTP, 
IPV or OPV, Hib. Prior doses of BCG vaccine (1 dose) and/or HBV (up to 2) were permitted. 
A total of 750 subjects were planned (see treatments for description of the four groups); 
approximately 125 subjects in group 1(ACWY4a) and in group 2 (ACWY4b), respectively; 250 subjects 
in group 3 (ACWY3) and 250 subjects in the Routine non-MenACWY group 4 were to be enrolled. 
Assuming an approximately 10% drop-out rate, each group would have approximately 113, 113, 225, 
or 225 evaluable subjects, respectively.

Assuming that subjects in this study had similar antibody responses as in the previous study V59P5 in 
infants receiving three doses .- The responses of this study for C, W and Y were 100% with 95% CI 
90/91%,100% see table 9.7.2-1.-  And assuming the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 was 0%, 
2%, or 4% lower in ACWY3 group compared to ACWY4, the power for the noninferiority comparison 
between ACWY3 and ACWY4 groups with a 2-sided type I error of 5% is shown in Table 9.7.2-2.  
Assessor’s comment:  
The response to serotype A was not accounted for. The MAH should comment. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized into one of 4 groups at a 1:1:2:2 ratio, stratified by study center. 
Groups 1 (ACWY4a) and 2 (ACWY4b) were to receive 3 infant doses at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and a 
toddler dose at 12 months of age; however, they were to have different schedules for the first blood 
draw (at 3 and 4 months, respectively). 
Group 3 (ACWY3) were to have 2 infant doses at 2 and 4 months of age, with a toddler dose at 12 
months of age. 
Group 4 (Routine) was to receive routine vaccines and not receive MenACWY vaccination. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary measures of immunogenicity were the percentage of subject with hSBA ≥1:8 for 
meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y. 
The main secondary endpoint was percentage of subjects with IgG antibody concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL 
and ≥1.0μg/mL against pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides for each PCV-13 serotype.

Statistical Methods 
Primary Immunogenicity Objectives 
The first primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate a sufficient immune response of 4 
doses of MenACWY given to infants at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age as measured by the percentage of 
subjects with serum bactericidal activity using human complement (hSBA) ≥1:8, directed against N 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y. 
H0: PACWY4 (A) ≤ 80% or PACWY4 (C) ≤ 85% or PACWY4 (W) ≤ 85% or PACWY4 (Y) ≤ 85% 
Ha: PACWY4 (A) > 80% and PACWY4 (C) > 85% and PACWY4 (W) > 85% and PACWY4 (Y) > 
85% where PACWY4 (A), PACWY4 (C), PACWY4 (W) and PACWY4 (Y) are the true percentages 
of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 in serogroups A, C, W, and Y in the ACWY4 group, respectively. 
The second primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate noninferiority of the immune 
response after 2 infant doses and a toddler dose of MenACWY at 2, 4, and 12 months of age (ACWY3 
group) as compared to 3 infant doses and a toddler dose of MenACWY at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age 
(ACWY4a and ACWY4b groups combined) as measured by the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 
against N meningitides serogroups C, W and Y at 1 month after the toddler dose. 
H0: PACWY3 – PACWY4 ≤-10% 
H1: PACWY3 – PACWY4 >-10% 
ACWY3 group was noninferior to ACWY4 (ie, ACWY4a+ACWY4b), if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval around the difference between the groups (PACWY3 minus PACWY4) in the percent 
of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 was greater than -10%. 
The secondary immunogenicity objectives of evaluating the immune response to PCV-13 antigens 
as affected by the concomitant administration of 2 or 3 doses of MenACWY in the first year of life 
(measured at 7 months of age), and of a 3 or 4-dose series ending in a toddler dose at 12 months 
(measured at 13 months of age), were performed using a noninferiority tests. 
At 7 months of age, noninferiority was as measured by the percentage of subjects with IgG antibody 
concentration ≥0.35 µg/mL against pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides for each serotype. ACWY4 
or ACWY3 group would be noninferior to the Routine group if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval around the group difference in percentage of subjects with IgG ≥0.35 µg/mL 
against each PCV-13 serotype (ACWY4 minus Routine or ACWY3 minus Routine) was greater than -
10%. A tiered approach was applied, utilizing a hierarchical sequential testing procedure that grouped 
the serotypes into 2 families (Family 1 serotypes included 1, 4, 6A, 7F, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F; and Family 
2 serotypes included 9V, 23F, 5, 6B and 3). 
At 13 months of age (ie, post-toddler dose), noninferiority was as measured by the GMCs for each 
PCV-13 serotype. The ACWY4 or ACWY3 group would be noninferior to the Routine group if the lower 
limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval around the ratio of GMCs between the groups was greater 
than 0.5. No hierarchical testing procedure was used. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 751 subjects were enrolled of which 571 (76%) subjects completed the study. The most 
common reason for premature withdrawal was due to withdrawal of consent (12%), followed by 
subjects being lost to follow-up (7%). Similar patterns were observed in the individual study groups.

Overall 733 subjects (98%) received the study vaccination and were included in the exposed set.  
For the analyses of immune responses at 7 months of age following the infant vaccinations, 595 
subjects (79%) were included in the Infant ACWY FAS and 553 subjects (74%) in the corresponding 
PPS. For the analyses of immune responses at 13 months of age 545 subjects (73%) were included in 
the Toddler ACWY FAS and 472 subjects (63%) in the PPS. 
For the analyses of immune responses to PCV-13 antigens at 7 months of age (infant PCV), the FAS 
and PPS included 70% and 61% of subjects respectively, and at the 13-month time point (Toddler 
PCV) 66% and 52%, respectively. 
Baseline data 
The mean age of subjects at enrolment was 66.6 days, with subjects having a mean weight of 5.39 kg 
and height of 58.342 cm. The most common race was Caucasian (58%), followed by Hispanic (18%). 
Overall, a slightly higher percentage of male subjects were enrolled compared with females (53% vs 
47). 
Assessor’s comment:  
Overall the baseline characteristics of the three MenACWY groups were similar. The routine control 
group had a slightly different gender distribution; as the patients were randomized this is likely to be a 
coincidence. 
Efficacy results 
The primary objective of demonstrating a sufficient immune response would be met if, at 13 months 
of age, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 was 
greater than 80% for serogroup A and greater than 85% for serogroups C, W and Y. 
One month after completion of a 4-dose series of MenACWY at 13 months of age, 96% of subjects had 
hSBA ≥1:8 against serogroup A, and 99% of subjects had hSBA ≥1:8 against serogroups C, W and Y

The lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 80% for serogroup A and greater than 85% for the 
other 3 serogroups, meeting the prespecified sufficiency criteria for immune response following 
administration of a 4-dose vaccination series (Table 11.4.1-1). 
Assessor’s comment:  
This primary endpoint was met. As mentioned above a lower limit of 90% would have been supported 
by the data of the previous study.  However, the results of the current study are also within a more 
stringent range, i.e.  the lower 95% CIs are all above 90%.  
The second primary objective was to demonstrate immunological non-inferiority of the 3-dose 
MenACWY series to the 4-dose series, as measured by percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 against 
N meningitidis serogroups C, W and Y at 13 months of age. 
Noninferiority would be established if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in 
percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 against N meningitidis serogroups C, W and Y between the 3-
dose series and (minus) the 4-dose series, was greater than -10%. Immune responses to serogroup A 
were not included in the noninferiority assessment. 
One month after the 3- or 4-dose vaccination series (ie, at 13 months of age), the percentages of 
subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 against serogroups C, W, and Y were similar for the ACWY4 and ACWY3 
groups (C: 99% vs 95%, respectively, W: 99% each, Y: 99% vs 100%). The lower limits of the 2-
sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages were -8%, -3% and -2% for serogroups C, W and Y, 
respectively, greater than -10% for all 3 serogroups, meeting the prespecified criteria.

Assessor’s comment:  
This primary endpoint was met: based upon the current chosen non-inferiority margin of -10% the 
three serogroups C, W and Y were non-inferior in the 3 dose group compared to the 4 dose group. No 
criterion was set for serotype A. However the criterion set for C, W and Y i.e. -10% was not met by 
serotype A.   
Although the drop out rate was much higher than anticipated the primary endpoints of the study were 
met. 
Effect of concomitant administration of 2 or 3 infant doses of MenACWY on immune 
responses to PCV-13 antigens 
At 7 months of age, 93.7% to 100% of subjects in ACWY3, 92.6% to 100% in ACWY4 and 94.2% to 
100% in Routine group had IgG concentrations  ≥0.35 µg/mL for all 8 Family 1 serotypes ((1, 4, 6A, 
7F, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F). For Family 2 (9V, 23F, 5, 6B and 3), 79.3% to 93% of subjects in ACWY3, 
87.6% to 96.3% in ACWY4 group and 82.3% to 92.4% in the Routine group had IgG concentrations ≥ 
0.35 µg/mL 
The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CIs around the vaccine group differences, for the ACWY3 group 
versus the Routine group, was greater than -10% for all serotypes. The prespecified noninferiority 
criterion was hence met for the ACWY3 group for all 8 serotypes in Family 1. Noninferiority was 
demonstrated for 2 serotypes of family 2 (9V and 23F). The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
group difference for serotype 5 was lower than -10%, resulting in sequential noninferiority testing not 
being done for other serotypes (6B and 3). 
Noninferiority was demonstrated in the ACWY4 group for 7 out of 8 Family 1 serotypes, as the lower 
limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the group difference for serotype 19A was lower than -10%. Testing 
was stopped in Family 2 as noninferiority was not demonstrated for all Family 1 serotypes.

Overall, after the infant vaccination series, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the group 
difference of percentage of subjects with anti-pneumococcal antibodies ≥ 0.35 µg/mL was greater than 
the prespecified margin of -10% for 11 of 13 serotypes in ACWY3 group (except serotypes 3 and 5) 
and for 12 of 13 serotypes in group ACWY4 (except serotype 19A).

At 13 months of age, the ACWY4 or ACWY3 group would be noninferior to the Routine group if the 
lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI around the ratio of GMCs between the groups was greater than 0.5. 
Noninferiority was demonstrated for all PCV-13 antigens in both ACWY4 and ACWY3 groups compared 
to the Routine group in terms of GMC ratio at month 13, 1 month after the toddler vaccination see

Assessor’s comment:  
It should be noted that the study was not sufficiently powered to evaluate possible interaction at 13 
months. Therefore no firm conclusion can be drawn.

Kinetics of immune response  
Secondary objectives aimed to evaluate the kinetics of immune response to 2 or 3 doses of MenACWY 
given during the first 6 months of life. Immune responses against the 4 MenACWY serogroups, as 
measured by the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 and hSBA GMTs was assessed at the 
following time points in the different groups: 
▫ At baseline (2 months of age, the Routine group); 
▫ 1 Month after 1st dose (3 months of age, ACWY4a group); 
▫ 2 Months after 1st dose (4 months of age, ACWY4b group); 
▫ 1 Month after 2nd dose (5 months of age, ACWY3 group); 
▫ 3 Months after 2nd dose (7 months of age, ACWY3 group) 
▫ 1 Month after 3rd dose (7 months of age, ACWY4 group). 
At baseline (2 months of age), the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 against serogroups A, C, W 
and Y were 4%, 9%, 20% and 7%, respectively. 
At 1 month following the first vaccination (3 months of age), values for A, C, W and Y serogroups were 
9%, 28%, 15% and 8%, respectively. At 2 months after the first vaccination (4 months of age), values 
against serogroups A, C, W and Y were 4%, 41%, 35% and 7%, respectively. 
At 1 month following the second vaccination (5 months of age), percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥
1:8 had increased against all 4 serogroups (A: 43%, C: 86%, W: 86%, Y: 67% ). 
At 1 month following the third infant vaccination (7 months of age, ACWY4 group), majority of subjects 
had hSBA ≥1:8 against the 4 serogroups (A: 84%, C: 95%, W: 99%, Y: 94%). 
At 3 months following the second of 2 infant vaccinations (7 months of age, ACWY3 group), 
percentages had decreased compared to values at 1 month following the second vaccination ie, at 5 
months of age (A: 23%, C: 71%, W: 74%, Y: 48%). Percentages were well above those in the Routine 
group at 7 months of age (≤1% for all serogroups).

Assessor’s comment:  
There is a clear increase of response after every dose for serotype A and also for serotype Y, for 
serotype C and W the increase after the second dose is less pronounced. A small percentage of infants 
in the routine group appeared to have antibodies. This is unlikely to be due to vaccination as  
vaccination with a meningococcal vaccine was an exclusion criterion. 
The percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 at 12 months of age following administration of either 2 
(ACWY3) or 3 vaccinations (ACWY4) in the first year of life are given in Table 11.4.1-5.  
Assessor’s comment:  
At 12 months, before the booster dose, the percentages in the ACWY4 group are significantly higher 
compared to the ACWY3 group. A substantial proportion of subjects in both the ACWY3 and ACWY4 
groups had no protective levels of bactericidal antibodies at that time. After the booster vaccination the 
proportion of subjects with protective levels of bactericidal antibodies increased in both groups 
significantly. To what extend the 2 and 3 dose primarily schedule has an impact on disease burden in 
the first year of life or persistence of vaccine efficacy after the first booster-dose needs to be 
established if a 2 or 3 dose primary schedule for infants from the age of 2 months would be proposed.   
Study V59_36 showed that Menveo administered to infants concomitant with routine vaccines (DTaP-
IPV-HiB and PCV13) at a 2+1 or 3+1 schedule (at 2, 4 and 12 or 2, 4, 6 and 12 MoA, respectively) 
induces a sufficient immune protection (hSBA > 1:8), with no interference with immune responses to 
PCV13 serotypes. This is considered important information to be included in the SmPC  
The MAH is asked to submit a type II variation with respective changes to the SmPC section 4.2 and 
section 5.1. The SmPC should also include information on waning antibody levels between primary and 
booster doses at that age, particularly after a 2-dose primary series.

Safety results 
Out of a total of 751 subjects enrolled in the study, 733 (98%) subjects were exposed to at least 1 
study vaccination, and hence included in the exposed set. Postvaccination solicited data were provided 
by a total of 708 subjects (94%) comprising the solicited safety set. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The percentage of subjects who dropped out per group and the reasons for dropping out were similar 
in the different groups. Percentage of subject dropping out due to an adverse event were overall <1% 
and in the different groups as follows; ACWY3 <1%, ACWY4a 0%, ACWY4b 2%, ACWY4 <1% routine 
<1%. 
Solicited adverse events 
The majority of subjects reported at least 1 solicited AE after the first vaccination (80% to 86%), with 
frequencies decreasing following the second and third infant vaccinations (70% to 79% and 66% to 
70%). No reduction in rates was reported following the fourth (ie toddler) vaccination. 
Local solicited adverse events 
The most commonly occurring local AE across groups within a 7 day period following all 4 vaccinations 
was tenderness: 30% to 36% after first vaccination, 25% to 28% after second, 19% to 24% after 
third and 24% to 31% after the fourth vaccination.  
Most of the local AEs were mild or moderate in nature. Severe tenderness was reported in a maximum 
of 6% of subjects following any vaccination, but did not continue beyond day 3 for most subjects.

Assessor’s comment:  
There was a tendency of decreasing frequency of tenderness after the second and third vaccination in 
all three groups. Overall the frequencies of the other solicited local adverse events remained roughly 
similar after the first, second, third and fourth vaccination. 
Systemic solicited adverse events 
The most commonly reported systemic AE following each vaccination was irritability (first vaccination: 
46% to 54%, second vaccination: 41% to 47%, third vaccination: 36% to 39%, fourth vaccination: 
36% to 43%). The second most commonly reported systemic AE was sleepiness (first vaccination: 
47% to 49%, second vaccination: 34% to 42%, third vaccination: 30% to 33%, fourth vaccination: 
27% to 35%). Similar to local AEs, a sequential decrease in percentages of subjects with systemic AEs 
was seen following each of the first 3 vaccinations. 
Fever, defined as body temperature ≥38.0 ºC, was reported in 4% to 5% of subjects following the first 
vaccination, 7% to 9% following the second, 6% to 10% following the third, and 8% to 11% following 
the fourth vaccination. Body temperatures ≥40 ºC were reported by 2 subjects in the ACWY4 group

following the third and fourth vaccination, and 1 subject in the ACWY3 group after the fourth 
vaccination. 
At least one severe solicited was reported by 18% in ACWY3 group, 21% in the ACWY4 group and18% 
in the routine group. As the occurrences of severe systemic AEs were similar across groups, no 
additional testing or inter-group comparisons were performed. 
Assessor’s comment:  
Out of 751 enrolled subjects, 733 (98%) were exposed to at least 1 study vaccination and provided 
postvaccination unsolicited safety data.  
In accordance with the specified safety objectives of Study V59_36 the MAH is requested to provide  
the percentage of subjects presenting, during days 1-7 after any vaccination, at least one 
severe systemic reaction, after administration of MenACWY with concomitant vaccines vs. 
concomitant vaccines alone and comment on differences observed (if applicable).

Assessor’s comment:  
There was a tendency of decreasing frequencies of systemic solicited adverse events with the second, 
third and fourth vaccination in all three groups. 
Analgesic and/or antipyretic medication was administered to 67% to 72% of subjects after any 
vaccination. 
Unsolicited adverse events 
Unsolicited AEs after any vaccination were reported by the majority of subjects (87% to 90%) across 
groups, with 4% to 13% considered possibly related to study vaccines.  
Unsolicited AEs with onset within 28 days after any study vaccination were reported by 70% to 75% of 
subjects across groups. Unsolicited AEs with onset within 28 days after any study vaccination that were 
considered possibly or probably related to the administered study vaccinations were reported in 3% to 
13% of subjects across groups. The most commonly reported possibly related unsolicited AEs belonged 
to the SOC ‘general disorders and administration site conditions’ (3% to 10%). 
See table below:

Assessor’s comment:  
The percentage of subjects with a possibly or probably related unsolicited adverse event was 
numerically lower in the routine group: i.e. overall 4% versus 10% and 13% in the ACWY3 and ACWY4 
group respectively. For onset within 28 days these percentages were respectively: 3%, 10% and 13%. 
This seems to be driven by general disorders and administration site conditions. 
The assessor is of the opinion that the observed higher percentage of possibly or probably related 
unsolicited adverse events in the ACWY groups does not have clinical significant relevance. The 
number of antigens in the AWCY groups is higher than in the routine group. For the ACWY4 group, 
each “vaccination” included MenACWY and concomitant routine vaccines including PCV-13. For the 
ACWY3 group, the first, second and fourth “vaccination” included MenACWY and routine vaccines while 
the third “vaccination” included routine vaccines only. For the Routine group, each “vaccination” 
included routine vaccines only. 
The most commonly reported SOC of AEs across groups was ‘infections and infestations’, reported by 
49% to 52% of subjects. This was followed by ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ (17% to 22%), ‘skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (15% to 22%) and ‘respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders’ 
(16% to 17%). 
The most commonly reported possibly related unsolicited AEs by preferred term were pyrexia (2% of 
subjects in ACWY3, 3% in ACWY4) and injection site induration (2% in each group). 
A total of 5 subjects had AEs that led to withdrawal from the study: Krabbe’s disease (1 subject in 
ACWY3 group), convulsion (2 subjects in the ACWY4 group), and in the Routine group 1 subject had 
bronchiolitis, and another had cardiopulmonary arrest and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. 
During the course of the study, 41 subjects experienced a total of 53 SAEs: The rates of SAEs across 
the groups were: 19 subjects in ACWY4, 11 subjects in ACWY3 and 11 subjects in the Routine group. 
None of the reported SAEs was considered to be possibly or probably related to the study vaccinations. 
All except 6 subjects had recovered at study termination. One subject in the Routine group died during 
the study period, due to an SAE of anoxic encephalopathy (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) 48 days 
after the first vaccination visit and an SAE of cardiopulmonary arrest. Neither of these SAEs was 
considered related to the administered study vaccination.

Assessor’s comment:  
It is agreed that the SAEs were considered not possibly or probably related to vaccination. 
The reactogenicity profiles for local and systemic adverse events were similar between the three 
groups.  
There were no clinically meaningful differences in unsolicited adverse events between the three 
groups.  
The number of systemic severe reactions during 1-7 days is presented for the solicited systemic 
adverse reactions, while in the first safety objective all systemic severe reactions are mentioned. The 
MAH should provide these data.  
The safety results are in line with the currently known safety profile and no new safety signals were 
identified. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The 2 primary objectives of this study were achieved.  There was a sufficient immune response 
following four doses of Men ACWY given to infants at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age as measured by the 
percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal activity using human complement (hSBA) ≥ 1:8. And 
noninferiority of two MenACWY primary infant doses followed by a toddler boosterdose (doses at 2, 4 
and 12 months of age) to three primary infant doses followed by a toddler dose (doses at 2, 4, 6 and 
12 months of age) was demonstrated for serotypes C, W and Y.  
Within the design of the study there was not accounted for serotype A. The MAH should comment why 
this was not done. 
With regard to the secondary objectives, concomitant administration of MenACWY vaccine to routine 
vaccines demonstrated noninferiority of the immune response to all 13 PCV antigens at 13 months of 
age. However, it should be noted that the study was not sufficiently powered for this. Therefore no 
firm conclusion with regard to this can be drawn. 
In addition the kinetics of the immune response up to 12 months are described. At 12 months, before 
the boosterdose a substantial proportion of subjects in both groups (ACWY3 and ACWY4) had no 
protective levels of bactericidal antibodies. The response percentages in the ACWY3 group were 
significantly lower compared to the ACWY4 group. The possible impact of this finding for disease 
burden during the first year of life and the persistence of vaccine efficacy following a single 
boosterdose should be clarified before vaccine use in this age category is considered. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in unsolicited adverse events between the three 
groups.  
The number of systemic severe reactions during 1-7 days is presented for the solicited systemic 
adverse reactions, while in the first safety objective all systemic severe reactions are mentioned. The 
MAH should provide these data. 
The safety results are in line with the currently known safety profile and no new safety signals were 
identified. 
In conclusion study V59_36 showed that Menveo administered to infants concomitant with routine 
vaccines (DTaP-IPV-HiB and PCV13) at a 2+1 or 3+1 schedule (at 2, 4 and 12 or 2, 4, 6 and 12 MoA,

respectively) induces a sufficient immune protection (hSBA > 1:8), with no interference with immune 
responses to PCV13 serotypes. This is considered important information to be included in the SmPC. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Study V59_36 showed that Menveo administered to infants concomitant with routine vaccines (DTaP-
IPV-HiB and PCV13) at a 2+1 or 3+1 schedule (at 2, 4 and 12 or 2, 4, 6 and 12 MoA, respectively) 
induces a sufficient immune protection (hSBA > 1:8), with no interference with immune responses to 
PCV13 serotypes. The immunogenicity and safety results are in line with what is described in the 
SmPC, therefore there is no need to update the SmPC based upon this study. 
The benefit-risk balance of Menveo remains positive.

4.  Additional clarifications requested 
1.  The second primary objective accounted for serotypes C, W and Y, within the design of the study 
there was not accounted for serotype A. The MAH should comment why this was not done. 
2.  In accordance with the specified safety objectives of Study V59_36 the MAH is requested to 
provide  the percentage of subjects presenting, during days 1-7 after any vaccination, at least one 
severe systemic reaction, after administration of MenACWY with concomitant vaccines vs. 
concomitant vaccines alone and comment on differences observed (if applicable). 
5.  Assessment of the responses to the request for 
clarification 
Question 1 
The second primary objective accounted for serotypes C, W and Y, within the design of the 
study there was not accounted for serotype A. The MAH should comment why this was not 
done. 
MAH Response 
The second primary objective of study V59_36 evaluated non-inferiority of the immune response to 
serogroups C, W and Y only. As this study was not initially powered for demonstration of non-
inferiority, sample size was not sufficient for non-inferiority testing against serogroup A. Furthermore, 
serogroup A meningococcal disease is rare in Europe and the Americas (Cohn et al, Jafri et al); these 
analyses are of limited clinical and public health relevance in these regions. Nevertheless, we did

observe that 88% of participants achieved hSBA titers ≥8 against serogroup A one month following 
completion of a 3- dose MenACWY-CRM vaccination series, exceeding the 85% sufficiency criterion 
specified in the first primary study objective.

Rapporteurs comment:  
Serotype A is rare in Europe and Americas, however it is endemic in Africa. For subjects travelling to 
Africa it could have been relevant information. It is agreed that with the 3-dose the primary endpoint 
criterion was met for serotype A i.e. the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 80% (it was 82%). 
The study was not powered for serotype A for the second primary objective; this objective was not met 
for serotype A. i.e the chosen non-inferiority margin of -10% was not met (it was -14% for serotype 
A). Although the vision of the MAH is not completely agreed the MAH sufficiently commented why the 
study was not powered for serotype A.  
Point resolved. 
Question 2 
In accordance with the specified safety objectives of Study V59_36 the MAH is requested to 
provide the percentage of subjects presenting, during days 1-7 after any vaccination, at 
least one severe systemic reaction, after administration of MenACWY with concomitant  
vaccines vs. concomitant vaccines alone and comment on differences observed (if 
applicable). 
MAH Response 
At least 1 severe solicited systemic AE following any vaccination was reported by a similar percentage 
of subjects who were administered MenACWY with concomitant vaccines (18% in ACWY3 and 21% in 
ACWY4 groups) compared with subjects who received routine concomitant vaccinations alone (18% in 
Routine group) (Table 1). As the occurrences of severe systemic AEs were similar across groups, no 
additional testing or inter-group comparisons were performed.

Rapporteurs comment: 
The requested information is provided. It is agreed with the MAH that the occurrence of severe 
systemic AEs can be considered similar.  
Point resolved. 
Question 3 
Study V59_36 showed that Menveo administered to infants concomitant with routine 
vaccines (DTaP-IPV-HiB and PCV13) at a 2+1 or 3+1 schedule (at 2, 4 and 12 or 2, 4, 6 and 
12 MoA, respectively) induces a sufficient immune protection (hSBA > 1:8), with no 
interference with immune responses to PCV13 serotypes. This is considered important 
information to be included in the SmPC The MAH is asked to submit a type II variation with 
respective changes to the SmPC section 4.2 and section 5.1. The SmPC should also include 
information on waning antibody levels between primary and booster doses at that age, 
particularly after a 2-dose primary series. 
MAH Response 
Menveo is currently licensed for active immunisation of children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and 
adults and the current SmPC, in section 5.1, already includes information relative to the use in children 
2 to 23 months of age. All that considered, the Company believes that adding more information on the 
use in children 2 to 23 months of age - for a product where the use in this age group is not approved - 
does not provide further value but rather might increase the risk of off-label use. 
Rapporteurs comment: 
In the recent type II variation number 18(April 2013) was evaluated whether the immunogenicity and 
safety of Menveo in infants 2 -23 months was considered sufficient to extend the indication and 
recommend a posology in this age group. In this variation several phase II and three phase three 
studies were submitted. Also co-administration with pneumococcal vaccines was 
evaluated http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Assessment_Report_-
Variation/human/001095/WC500144651.pdf.As the results of study V59_36 are in line with the results 
found in the studies submitted in the type II variation 18 (April 2013), it is agreed with the MAH that 
the current information in the SmPC is considered sufficient.  
Point resolved.

 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

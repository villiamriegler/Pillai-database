CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Temozolomide Accord is indicated for the treatment of:  
-  
adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy 
(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. 
children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, 
such as glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression 
after standard therapy. 
-  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Temozolomide Accord should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological 
treatment of brain tumours.  
Anti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
Adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme 
Temozolomide Accord is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) 
followed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase).

Concomitant phase 
TMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal 
radiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or 
discontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and 
non-haematological toxicity criteria.  TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day 
concomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met:  
- 
- 
- 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/l  
thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l  
common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, 
nausea and vomiting). 
During treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be 
temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the 
haematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.

absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l; CTC non-
haematological toxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting). 
Monotherapy phase 
Four weeks after completing the TMZ + RT concomitant phase, TMZ is administered for up to 
6 cycles of monotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days 
followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if 
the CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade ≤ 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and 
vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is ≥ 100 x 
109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent cycles. 
Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent cycle 
except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase should 
be applied according to Tables 2 and 3.  
During treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of 
TMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.

• dose level -1 (100 mg/m2 ) still results in unacceptable toxicity 
• the same Grade 3 non-haematological toxicity (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting) 
recurs after dose reduction.   
Adult and paediatric patients 3 years of age or older with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma:  
A treatment cycle comprises 28 days. In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is 
administered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day 
treatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial 
dose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days 
if there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4)  
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
In patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant 
glioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy 
of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.  
Patients with hepatic or renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those 
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child's Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the 
pharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised 
when TMZ is administered in these patients.  
Elderly patients 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is 
not affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).  
Method of administration 
Temozolomide Accord should be administered in the fasting state.  
The capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. 
If vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). 
Severe myelosuppression (see section 4.4).

4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Opportunistic infections and reactivation of infections 
Opportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections 
(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia 
Patients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule 
were shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, 
prophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42 
- day regimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, 
they are to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade ≤ 1.  
There may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. 
However, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed 
closely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have 
been reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other 
steroids. 
HBV 
Hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been 
reported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with 
positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be 
monitored and managed appropriately. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see 
section 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If 
abnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the 
potential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should 
be repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each 
treatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the 
benefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last 
treatment with temozolomide. 
Meningoencephalitis herpetic 
In post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in 
patients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids 
administration. 
Malignancies 
Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have 
also been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).  
Anti-emetic therapy  
Nausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.  
Anti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.  
Adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Anti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it   
is strongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.  
Patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma  
Patients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may 
require anti-emetic therapy.  
Laboratory parameters 
Patients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, 
which may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some 
cases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including 
carbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to 
dosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count ≥ 100 x 
109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 
48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If ANC falls 
to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should be reduced 
one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and 200 mg/m2. The 
lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2.  
Paediatric population 
There is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in 
older children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  
Elderly patients (> 70 years of age) 
Elderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with 
younger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly 
patients.    
Female patients 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy while they 
are receiving TMZ, and for at least 6 months following completion of treatment. 
Male patients 
Men being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child for at least 3 months after 
receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see 
section 4.6). 
Lactose  
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.  
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the 
extent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl 
triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC).  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Administration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under 
the curve (AUC).  
As it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide Accord 
should be administered without food.  
Based on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of 
dexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or 
phenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated 
with a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.  
No studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of 
other medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low 
protein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
(see section 5.2).  
Use of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of 
myelosuppression. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy while they 
are receiving TMZ, and for at least 6 months following completion of treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2, 
teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide Accord 
should not be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the 
patient should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  
 Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued 
while receiving treatment with TMZ.  
Male fertility  
TMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should use effective 
contraceptive measures and be advised not to father a child for at least 3 months after receiving the last 
dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment, because of the possibility of 
irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
TMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see 
section 4.8).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Clinical trial experience 
In patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, 
vomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic 
adverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is 
presented after Table 4. For patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and 
vomiting (36 %) were usually  Grade 1 or 2 (0 – 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either 
self-limiting or readily  controlled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea 
and vomiting was 4 %. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are 
listed in Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. 
Frequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); 
Common 
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare 
(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Laboratory results 
Myelosuppression (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), which is known dose-limiting toxicity for 
most cytotoxic agents, including TMZ, was observed. When laboratory abnormalities and adverse 
events were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 
neutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8% of the patients. Grade 3 or 
Grade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14% of the 
patients who received TMZ.  
Recurrent or progressive malignant glioma 
Laboratory results 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients 
treated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and 4 
%, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the nadir 
between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of 
cumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk 
of bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.  
Gender 
In a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and 
169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male 
subjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 
neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12% vs 5%, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9% vs 3 %, in 
women vs men in the first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 
neutropenia occurred in 8 % of female vs 4% of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % 
of female vs 3 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly 
diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0% of male 
subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1% of female vs 0% of male subjects in the first cycle of 
therapy.  
Paediatric population 
Oral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or 
recurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although 
the data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in 
children under the age of 3 years has not been established. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated 
clinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is 
expected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, 
over 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, 
multi-organ failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for 
more than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow 
suppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be 
provided as necessary.

Temozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the 
active monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to 
be due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at 
the N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of 
the methyl adduct.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme  
A total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). 
Patients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day 
of RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by 
monotherapy TMZ (150 – 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting 
4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii 
pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.  
TMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57%) in 
the RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22%) in the TMZ + RT arm.  
The hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95% CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank p < 
0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26% vs 
10%) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ 
monotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated 
a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1).

Figure 1      Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)  
The results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance 
status (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. 
However, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.  
Recurrent or progressive malignant glioma 
Data on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status 
[KPS] ≥70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral 
TMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29% received prior chemotherapy), and the 
other was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs. procarbazine in a total of 225 patients 
(67% received prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary 
endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the 
non-comparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19%, the median progression-free survival was 
2.1 months, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on 
MRI scans was 8%.  
In the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than 
for procarbazine (21% vs. 8%, respectively – chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and 
1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for 
TMZ and procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving 
patients was significantly higher in the TMZ arm (60%) compared with the procarbazine arm (44%) 
(chi-square p = 0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a 
KPS ≥ 80.  
Data on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time 
to worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The 
median times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for 
procarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03).

Recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma  
In a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the 
treatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46%. The 
median PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the 
central reviewer assessment, was 35% (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to- treat-population (ITT) 
n=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT 
population was 44% with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results 
for the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were 
similar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was 
strongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life. 
Paediatric population 
Oral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or 
recurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance 
to TMZ is similar to adults.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
TMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-
1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-
carboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to 
methylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is 
thought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. 
Relative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4% and 23%, respectively. In 
vivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.  
Absorption 
After oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached 
as early as 20 minutes post administration (mean times between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral 
administration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8% 
indicating complete absorption.  
Distribution 
TMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10% to 20%), and thus it is not expected to interact with 
highly protein-bound substances.  
PET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses rapidly the blood-brain barrier 
and is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC 
of TMZ was approximately 30% of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.  
Elimination 
The half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. 
Following oral administration, approximately 5% to 10% of the dose is recovered unchanged in the 
urine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-
carboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.  
Plasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and 
half-life are independent of dose.  
Special populations 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Analysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was 
independent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma 
pharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those 
observed in patients with normal hepatic function.  
Paediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Single-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in 
rats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, 
testes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60% to 100% of rats and 
dogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, 
except for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because 
the doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect 
has been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.  
TMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and 
dog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. 
Dose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A 
variety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell 
adenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were 
evident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the 
occurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even 
for an alkylating agent.  
Results of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome 
aberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Temozolomide Accord is and what it is used for 
Temozolomide is an antitumour-r medicine. 
Temozolomide Accord capsules is used for the treatment of specific forms of brain tumours: 
- 
In adults with newly-diagnosedglioblastoma multiforme. Temozolomide is first used together 
with radiotherapy (concomitant phase of treatment) and after that alone (monotherapy phase of 
treatment).  
In children 3 years and older and adult patients with malignant glioma, glioblastoma multiforme 
or anaplastic Astrocytoma. Tamozolomide is used in these tumours if they return or get worse 
after standard treatment. 
- 
2.  What you need to know before you take Temozolomide Accord  
Do not take Temozolomide Accord 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have had an allergic reaction to another anti-cancer medicine called dacarbazine. Signs of 
allergic reaction include feeling itchy, breathlessness or wheezing, swelling of the face, lips, 
tongue or throat. 
if you have a reduced number of blood cells (myelosuppression), such as your white 
blood cell count and platelet count. These blood cells are important for fighting infection and 
for proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you have enough of 
these cells before you begin treatment. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temozolomide Accord,  
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infectioncalled 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you are a newly-diagnosed patient (glioblastoma 
multiforme) you may be receiving temozolomide for 42 days in combination with radiotherapy. 
In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this type of pneumonia 
(PCP). 
if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temozolomide 
Accord could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. 
Patients will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment. 
if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells count and platelets count, 
or blood clotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during 
treatment. Your doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change your treatment. 
You may also need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop treatment with 
temozolomide. Your blood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects 
of temozolomide on your blood cells.  
as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia. 
if you have nausea (feeling sick in your stomach) and/or vomiting, which are very common side 
effects of Temozolomide (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-
emetic) to help prevent vomiting. 
If you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take 
temozolomide until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do not 
take a second dose on the same day. 
if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection, contact your doctor immediately. 
if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infections, bruising or 
bleeding.   
if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of temozolomide may need to be adjusted.   
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is 
limited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temozolomide Accord. 
Other medicines and Temozolomide Accord 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with 
Temozolomide Accord during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor. 
Effective contraceptive precautions must be taken by female patients who are able to become pregnant  
during treatment with Temozolomide Accord and for at least 6 months following completion of 
treatment. 
You should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temozolomide Accord. 
Male fertility 
Temozolomide Accord may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective 
contraception and not father a child for at least 3 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended 
to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Driving and using machines 
Temozolomide Accord may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or 
machines or cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4). 
Temozolomide Accord contains lactose 
This medicine contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
Temozolomide Accord contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium- free’. 
3.  How to take Temozolomide Accord  
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How to open sachet  
Open the sachet by folding and tearing along the fold line with the notch in the corner of the sachet. 
Temozolomide should only be prescribed by specialists experienced in brain tumours. 
Dosage and duration of treatment  
Your doctor will work out your dose of temozolomide. This is based on your size (height and weight) 
and if you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. You may be 
given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking temozolomide to prevent or 
control nausea and vomiting. 
Take your prescribed dose of Temozolomide Accord once a day. Take the dose on an empty stomach; 
for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat breakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a 
glass of water.  Do not open, crush or chew the capsules.   
If a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. Avoid inhaling the 
powder. If you accidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water.  
If you are taking Temozolomide Accord in combination with radiotherapy (newly diagnosed 
patients): 
While the radiotherapy is ongoing your doctor will start temozolomide at a dose of 75 mg/m² and the 
actual daily dose you take will depend on your height and weight. You will take this dose every day 
for 42 days (up to 49 days) in combination with radiotherapy. Based on your blood counts and how 
you tolerate temozolomide, the dose may be delayed or stopped. 
Once the radiotherapy is completed, you will interrupt treatment for 4 weeks to give your body a 
chance to recover. 
Then, you will start the monotherapy phase. 
During the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temozolomide Accord will be different. 
Your doctor will work out your exact dose. Then there may be up to 6 treatment cycles, and each one 
lasts 28 days. You will take your new dose of Temozolomide capsules initially at 150 mg/m² once 
daily for the first five days (“dosing days”) of each cycle, followed by 23 days without temozolomide; 
this adds up to a 28 day treatment cycle.  
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After day 28, the next cycle will begin, in which you will again take this medicine once daily for five 
days followed by 23 days without temozolomide. Based on your blood counts and how you tolerate 
temozolomide during each treatment cycle, the dose may be adjusted, delayed or stopped. 
If you are taking Temozolomide Accord capsules alone (without radiotherapy): 
A treatment cycle with Temozolomide Accord comprises 28 days. You will take the capsules once 
daily for the first five days (“dosing days”) followed by 23 days without temozolomide, adding up to 
the 28 day treatment cycle.  
After Day 28, the next cycle will begin, in which you will again take this medicine once daily for five 
days followed by 23 days without temozolomide. Before each new treatment cycle, your blood will be 
tested to see if the temozolomide dose needs to be adjusted. 
If you have not been treated before with chemotherapy, you will take your first dose of temozolomide 
at 200 mg/m² once daily for the first five days (“dosing days”) followed by 23 days without 
temozolomide. If you have been treated before with chemotherapy, you will take your first dose of 
temozolomide at 150 mg/m² once daily for the first five days (“dosing days”) followed by 23 days 
without temozolomide. 
Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the next cycle. 
Each time you start a new treatment cycle, be sure you understand exactly how many capsules of each 
strength you need to take each day and how many days you will receive this dose. 
All patients 
Temozolomide comes in different strength capsules (shown on the outer label in mg). Each strength 
has a different colour cap. Depending on the dose of temozolomide that your doctor prescribes, you 
may have to take several capsules on each dosing day of the treatment cycle. 
- 
Be sure you understand exactly how many capsules you need to take of each strength. Ask your 
doctor or pharmacist to write down the number of each strength (including colour) that you need 
to take each dosing day. 
Be sure you know exactly which days are your dosing days. 
Be sure you review the dose with your health care provider each time you start a new cycle. 
Sometimes the dose or the mix of capsules you need to take will be different from the last cycle. 
Once you take the medicine home, if you are confused or unsure about how to take your dose, 
call for re-instruction before beginning the treatment cycle. Errors in how you take this 
medicine may have serious health consequences. 
- 
- 
- 
If you take more Temozolomide Accord than you should 
If you accidentally take more capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse 
immediately. 
If you forget to take Temozolomide Accord 
Take the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. If a full day has gone by, check with 
your doctor. Do not double the next dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you 
to do so. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Patients taking temozolomide in combination with radiation therapy may experience different side 
effects than patients taking temozolomide alone. 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
 a severe allergic reaction (hypersensitive) (hives, wheezing or other breathing difficulty),  
uncontrolled bleeding, 
seizures (convulsions),  
fever,  
chills, 
severe headache that does not go away. 
Temozolomide treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause you to 
have increased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and/or a reduced 
resistance to infections. The reduction of blood cells is usually temporary, but in some cases may be 
for longer and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will monitor 
your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In some 
cases, your temozolomide dose will be reduced or discontinued.

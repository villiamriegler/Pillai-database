Summary of risk management plan for LYXUMIA (Lixisenatide) 
This is a summary of the RMP for LYXUMIA. The RMP details important risks of 
LYXUMIA how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about LYXUMIA’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
LYXUMIA’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how LYXUMIA should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for LYXUMIA should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
LYXUMIA’s RMP. 
1.  THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
LYXUMIA is authorized for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to achieve 
glycemic control in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and/or basal 
insulin when these, together, with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycemic control 
(see SmPC for the full indication). It contains lixisenatide as the active substance and it is 
given by subcutaneous route (see SmPC for details).  
Further information about the evaluation of LYXUMIA’s benefits can be found in 
LYXUMIA’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency website, under the medicine’s webpage:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/lyxumia 
2.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR 
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS  
Important risks of LYXUMIA, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about LYXUMIA’s risks, are outlined in the next 
sections.  
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
 The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
 The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of LYXUMIA is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ outlined in the next section. 
2.1. 
List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of LYXUMIA are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of LYXUMIA. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine);

The subgroup analysis for TEAEs potentially related to pancreatitis during 
the entire treatment period for all Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies by 
intrinsic factors did not reveal any specific trend.  
Important identified risk: Pancreatitis
Subgroup analysis by anti-lixisenatide antibody status did not show any 
difference in the incidence of pancreatitis between antibody-positive or 
antibody-negative patients.

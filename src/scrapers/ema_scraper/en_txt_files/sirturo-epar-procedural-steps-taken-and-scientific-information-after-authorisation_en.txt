are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Information: 
Consideration should be given to WHO guidelines when 
selecting the appropriate combination regimen. 
Only use SIRTURO in combination with other medicinal 
products to which the patient’s MDR-TB isolate has been 
shown to be susceptible in vitro, or is likely to be 
susceptible. 
The total duration of treatment with SIRTURO is 24 weeks. 
Data on longer treatment duration is very limited. When 
treatment with SIRTURO is considered necessary beyond 
24 weeks to obtain a curative treatment, a longer duration 
of therapy may be considered under close safety 
surveillance.

Product Characteristics.

use of bedaquiline (BDQ) from 28 December 2012 to 30 
September 2016 suggest that when co administered with 
other medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval 
(including delamanid and levofloxacin), an additive or 
synergistic effect on QT prolongation cannot be excluded. 
Caution is recommended when prescribing bedaquiline 
concomitantly with medicinal products with a known risk of 
QT prolongation. In the event that co administration of 
such medicinal products with bedaquiline is necessary, 
clinical monitoring including frequent electrocardiogram 
assessment is recommended. Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
under “Cardiovascular safety” was updated accordingly.

the results from non-clinical studies. In addition, the

based mutations generated in preclinical studies lead to 8-

no clear relationship between increased post-baseline

Furthermore the MAH included the information from in vitro

Extension of indication to include treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older weighing 
at least 40 kg) with COVID-19, who do not require supplemental oxygen, based on interim results from 
study D8851C00001 (TACKLE); this is an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study assessing the safety and efficacy of a single 600 mg dose of AZD7442 (× 2 IM 
injections) compared with matching placebo for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in non-
hospitalized adults. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance. Version 2 Succession 1 of the RMP 
has also been submitted. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) 
P/0048/2022 and P/0047/2022 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0048/2022 and P/0047/2022 were not yet 
completed as some measures were deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Derogation(s) of market exclusivity 
N/A 
Scientific advice 
The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 20 November 2020 (EMA/SA/0000046190). The 
Scientific Advice pertained to clinical aspects and statistical methods of the dossier.

Key aspects are provided below. In general, the final design of the TACKLE study was aligned with the 
feedback received, and key considerations from the Agencies were addressed. 
•  CHMP recommended that the proportion of participants who develop hypoxemia (O2 saturation < 
94% on room air on 2 occasions at least 8 hours apart) or hospitalization requiring non-invasive 
ventilation, high-flow oxygen devices, invasive mechanical ventilation, ECMO or death during the 
28-day follow-up period could also be considered as primary endpoint. AstraZeneca’s position was 
that this was already covered in the composite endpoint. 
•  CHMP recommended that hospitalization for COVID-19 complications or sequelae during the 168-
day post-dose period should be added as a key secondary endpoint. However, this was already 
included as a secondary endpoint, which was considered appropriate. 
•  CHMP recommended that patients withdrawing/lost to follow-up should be counted as treatment 
failures. To address this, patients withdrawing/lost to follow-up were to be analyzed within a 
sensitivity analysis. Feedback received from FDA during the review of the protocol and during the 
study was incorporated, where possible.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus responsible for the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are involved with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
(RAAS) through ACE2, the enzyme that functions as a receptor for both viruses and also physiologically 
counters RAAS activation. Clinical symptoms have been shown to occur most commonly between days 4 
and 5 from exposure. The most common symptoms reported in the literature so far include fever, cough, 
fatigue and shortness of breath. Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are the major 
complications of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection can activate innate and adaptive immune responses 
and result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease. These uncontrolled inflammatory 
responses may lead to local and systemic tissue damage. COVID-19 severity hinges on the development 
of cytokine storm characterized by elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, IgG-, 
IgM- and IgA-specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most patients, along with the 
viral RNA. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
AstraZeneca is seeking approval for Evusheld for the treatment in adults and adolescents (12 years of 
age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with COVID-19 who do not require oxygen (see sections 4.2,5.1 
and 5.2). 
The recommended dosage is 600 mg of Evusheld, administered as two separate 3.0 mL, sequential, IM 
injections of 300 mg of tixagevimab and 300 mg of cilgavimab. 
This indication is being sought based on Study D8851C00001 (TACKLE), an ongoing Phase III, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in the treatment of mild to moderate 
COVID-19. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Globally, as of 7 September 2022, there have been 603,711,760 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 
including 6,484,136 deaths, reported to WHO. In Europe, 249,105,808 case were confirmed. {World 
Health Organization (WHO) 2022}. 
With a basic reproduction number R0 value at the start of the pandemic estimated between 2.43 to 3.10 
without medical intervention, SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible from person to person, which has 
contributed to its exponential dissemination worldwide (D’Arienzo and Coniglio 2020). The emergence of 
more virulent variants (e.g., Delta with an R0 of 3.2 to 8 [Liu and Rocklöv 2021] and Omicron [R0 
unknown at the time of writing]) has further increased the rate of spread globally. In March 2022, the 
Omicron BA.2 subvariant was the most prevalent variant globally, comprising 86% of all cases sequenced 
(as of 22 March 2022; WHO 2022b). As of 04 April 2022, 45% of all samples sequenced in the US were 
Omicron BA.2; in the UK the frequency of BA.2 was 95%, and in the majority of countries in Europe and 
Asia the frequency of BA.2 was > 70% and increasing (CoVariants 2022). Currently, globally, from 
5 August to 5 September 2022, 118 028 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were shared through GISAID. Among 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 8/130 
 
 
 
 
these, 117 317 sequences were the Omicron variant of concern (VOC), accounting for 99.4% of 
sequences reported globally in the past 30 days. A comparison of sequences submitted to GISAID in 
epidemiological week 34 (22 to 28 August 2022) and week 33 (15 to 21 August 2022) shows that BA.5 
Omicron descendent lineages continue to be dominant globally, with an increase in weekly prevalence 
from 84.8% to 86.8%. The prevalence of BA.4 descendent lineages decreased from 6.8% in week 33 to 
4.2% in week 34 including BA.4.6 descendent lineage, which decreased from 3.5% to 2% within the 
same time period. The prevalence of BA.2 descendent lineages (BA.2.X) remained stable in week 34 
compared to week 33 (2.6% in week 33 and 2.5% in week 34). BA.2.75, an Omicron descendent lineage 
under monitoring, still shows a relatively low (0.9% and 1.2% in weeks 33 and 34 respectively) 
prevalence globally, but a number of countries have observed recent increasing trends. {taken from 
World Health Organization (WHO) 2022}. Many studies have shown that severe illness and death occur in 
patients with certain risk factors including older age and underlying medical comorbidities, such as 
hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, immunocompromising 
conditions and obesity. (Chams et al, 2020) 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Three major outbreaks of the coronavirus, a zoonotic virus known to cause respiratory disease, have 
been reported since 2002, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the most recent 2019-nCoV, or more 
recently known as SARS-CoV-2. Bats are known to be the primary animal reservoir for coronaviruses. 
However, in the past few decades, the virus has been able to mutate and adapt to infect humans, 
resulting in an animal-to-human species barrier jump. The emergence of a novel coronavirus poses a 
serious global public health threat and possibly carries the potential of causing a major pandemic 
outbreak in the naïve human population (Sharma et al., 2021). SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus 
responsible for the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Coronavirus entry into host cells is mediated by 
the transmembrane S glycoprotein that binds to the cellular receptor hACE2 allowing the viral genome to 
enter and replicate in the cell (Tortorici and Veesler 2019). As the S protein is surface-exposed and 
mediates the entry into host cells, it is the main target of neutralizing antibodies and is the primary target 
for mAbs and vaccines. Unlike the majority of coronaviruses that mainly cause mild disease in humans 
and animals, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in the lower respiratory tract to cause acute respiratory distress 
syndrome and fatal pneumonia. The uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation and increased secretion of pro-
inflammatory cytokines associated with severe disease is suggestive of a cytokine storm, especially in 
patients who are critically ill (Huang et al 2020, CDC 2022, Guan et al 2020). These manifestations are 
also characteristic of SARS-CoV, to which SARS-CoV-2 bears 79% genetic similarity, and the more 
distantly related MERS-CoV, both of which were responsible for prior outbreaks in 2002 to 2003 and 
2012, respectively (Gorbalenya et al 2020). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The estimated incubation period for COVID-19 is up to 14 days, with a median of 4 to 5 days from 
exposure to initial onset of symptoms (Zhou et al 2020b). The symptoms of COVID-19, if present, differ 
with severity of disease. The symptoms most frequently associated with symptomatic mild to moderate 
illness include fever, cough, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, 
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a loss in sense of taste or 
smell. COVID-19 is a systemic disease affecting not just the respiratory tract but also in myocardial, 
renal, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and pharyngeal tissues and where hACE2 receptors have been 
identified (Gupta et al 2020). Patients may progress to severe pneumonia or develop acute 
respiratory distress syndrome, which is the primary cause for respiratory failure, and direct organ 
damage by the virus likely contributes to multiorgan failure. Some people who recover from COVID-19 go 
on to suffer from symptoms long-term. Mortality risk factors associated with COVID 19 include age > 60 
Assessment report

years (significantly greater for those 80 years and older), male sex, and chronic medical conditions 
including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. (Zhou et al 2020a). 
Management 
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a major threat to global health 
and economies (Di Fusco et al 2021, Zost et al 2020). As transmission continues and different variants of 
SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of severe disease and hospitalization, and in some countries, mortality, 
remain high. Breakthrough infections of fully vaccinated individuals continue to emerge both in the 
general population (Hacisuleyman et al 2021) and in high-risk populations (Agha et al 2021, ACIP 2021). 
The latest variant of concern, the highly mutated Omicron variant and its lineages, has increased 
transmissibility versus the original and Delta strains (Garcia-Beltran et al 2022).Early data suggests that 
vaccine effectiveness is reduced against Omicron B.1.1.529 (Dejnirattisai et al 2021; Regev-Yochay et al 
2022) and therefore is likely leading to breakthrough disease in a COVID-19 vaccinated/recovered 
population as well as in those who remain unvaccinated or unresponsive to vaccines. Despite the reduced 
severity seen with Omicron infections (Lauring et al 2022), certain individuals remain at an increased risk 
of severe disease and includes, but is not limited to, the elderly, cancer patients as well as those with 
ongoing chronic health conditions. Globally, there is still a critical need to reduce hospitalizations and 
reduce the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare systems. Therefore, preventing progression of mild to 
moderate COVID-19 to severe disease remains a significant clinical need. 
Clinical management of COVID-19 is based on supportive care and there are limited approved/authorized 
effective treatment or prevention interventions, which include antivirals as well as mAbs (e.g., in some 
markets: remdesivir [VELKURY], PF07321332/ritonavir [PAXLOVID], regdanvimab [REGKIRONA], 
casirivimab and imdevimab [RONAPREVE], and sotrovimab [XEVUDY]), and finally EVUSHELD which 
results in healthcare resources being stretched (Tangcharoensathien et al 2021). Recent in vitro antiviral 
resistance studies have demonstrated that some of the mAbs in late clinical development, do not offer 
significant neutralization of the emergent SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants and as a consequence are no 
longer available in some markets. Evusheld remains one of the only mAb products to retain neutralizing 
activity against the Omicron variant authentic virus in vitro, with comparable activity against Omicron 
BA.2 to the original strain (Case et al 2022) and also some residual activity against BA.4/5 although this 
seems to be more limited (Takashita et al 2022). 
As the pandemic continues, and new variants emerge, there is a need for additional effective therapeutic 
antibodies that target different epitopes on the spike protein, and for people ineligible for antivirals, to 
prevent COVID-19 disease progression and its serious complications (Kim et al 2020). 
Clinical benefit is likely to be achieved by treating patients early in their disease course while the disease 
is primarily driven by replication of SARS-CoV-2, before the innate immune/inflammatory response is 
triggered, and the disease progresses to severe illness requiring hospitalization. However, treatments 
available specifically in the outpatient setting are limited.  Overall, despite effective vaccination programs, 
COVID-19 remains a global threat with significant numbers of patients contracting the disease. Early 
intervention is critical to prevent progression to severe disease, especially for those who are at high risk 
of severe COVID-19. There are limited treatment options available and, as variants emerge, there is a 
risk that treatments that are currently effective may not remain so, therefore further options that are 
effective against current variants are needed, including those available in the outpatient setting. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Evusheld is a combination of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific 
antiviral monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (tixagevimab and cilgavimab) that bind to non-overlapping 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022

epitopes on the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and block its interaction with the human 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 host cellular receptor, resulting in a blockade of virus entry, neutralizing 
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Each mAb is engineered with YTE and TM substitutions to extend half-life and 
reduce the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, respectively, which is a key 
theoretical concern with mAbs, Evusheld is administered by IM injection.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The clinical development program evaluated the safety and efficacy of EVUSHELD in the treatment of mild 
to moderate COVID-19 in accordance with regulatory guidance and advice received from Regulatory 
Authorities.  
Study D8851C00001 (TACKLE), an ongoing Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, AstraZeneca-sponsored study in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 provides 
key data supporting the efficacy and safety of Evusheld in this application. Approximately 90% of 
participants met the protocol definition of being at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. 
This Application also provides the final CSR for the AstraZeneca-sponsored Phase I FTIH study (Study 
D8850C00001). An overview of these studies is provided in Section 2.3.1. 
The safety profile of Evusheld has been assessed in 4210 participants in the prophylaxis Phase III studies 
PROVENT and STORM CHASER (300 mg IM), and 50 participants in the interim Phase I study analysis (to 
Day 211 for all cohorts/Day 271 for 300 mg IM and 300 mg IV cohorts) (300 mg IM, 300 mg IV, 1000 mg 
IV, and 3000 mg IV), submitted previously. The TACKLE study included in this Application adds safety 
data from a further 452 participants with mild to moderate COVID-19 at 600 mg IM with median safety 
follow-up of 84 days (DCO 21 August 2021). The final analysis of the Phase I study provides safety data 
up to 12 months. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
AstraZeneca procedures, internal quality control measures and audit programs provide reassurance that 
the clinical study program was carried out in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, as documented by 
the ICH. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

Tabular overview of clinical studies (Studies with Evusheld included in this application):  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK data for the following studies were submitted: 
•  Study D8850C00001 (Phase I FTIH) – final CSR (interim PK data were available with prophylaxis 
application) 
•  Study D8851C00001 (TACKLE), phase 3 study for treatment indication – interim CSR (with the 
first submission package, PK results were presented with DCO 21 August 2021; with submission 
of responses results were presented with DCO 14 January 2022) 
The TACKLE Phase III study utilized clonal cell line material (commercial material). 
TACKLE serum PK samples were analysed by the same validated assay used for the Phase I and 
prophylaxis Phase III (STORM CHASER [D8850C00003] and PROVENT [D8850C00002]) PK samples (PPD 
Laboratories, Richmond, Virginia using a LC-MS/MS method LCMSF 1024.1 Version 1.00). Bioanalytical 
reports for the determination of AZD8895 and AZD1061 human serum concentrations in TACKLE are 
currently outstanding and will be available by the end of Q4 2022. The bioanalytical reports for study 
D8850C00001 for the quantitation of AZD8895 and AZD1061 in human serum (report RQHJ) and in 
human nasal lining fluid (report RRFI) are provided. For analysis of Study D8850C00001 serum samples, 
a maximum of 391 days passed between sample collection and analysis, which is slightly exceeding the 
currently validated long term stability period of 358 days. Stability experiments are, however, still 
ongoing. Overall mean accuracy and precision of QC samples was below 15%. Reasons for reanalysis are 
reported and considered acceptable. Incurred sample reanalysis of approximately 10% of study samples 
met the acceptance criteria. The population PK model submitted previously as part of the prophylaxis 
application included final data from Phase I Study D8850C00001 and primary DCO data from TACKLE; 
therefore, the model has not been updated. In addition, one exploratory exposure-response analysis and 
a viral dynamic modelling report were submitted to support the treatment indication.

D8850C00001 (Phase I) 
This was a Phase I, FTIH, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study evaluating 
the safety, tolerability, and PK of EVUSHELD in healthy adult participants 18 to 55 years of age. 
Participants were randomized 10:2 to receive either EVUSHELD or placebo administered IV or IM, across 
5 fixed dose cohorts as follows: Cohort 1a (EVUSHELD 300 mg or placebo IM), Cohort 1b (EVUSHELD 300 
mg or placebo IV), Cohort 2 (EVUSHELD 1000 mg or placebo IV), Cohort 3 (EVUSHELD 3000 mg or 
placebo IV), and Cohort 4 (EVUSHELD 3000 mg with the 2 mAbs co-administered, or placebo IV). In 
Cohorts 1a, 1b, 2, and 3, the 2 constituent mAbs of EVUSHELD were administered as separate injections 
or infusions; in Cohort 4, the 2 mAbs were co-administered within the same IV infusion. Blood samples 
for serum PK analysis were collected at predose (baseline), mid-infusion (IV), end of dosing (IV), 8 hours 
post-dose, Day 2, and Post-dose Follow-up Days 4, 6, 8, 15, 31 61, 91, 151, 211, 271, and 361. 
Nasosorption samples for NLF PK analysis were collected at baseline (predose), Days 8, 31, 91, and 151.

(AZD8895 + AZD1061) Following Single Dose IM or IV administration to Healthy Participants, 
Through Day 361 (Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set) - D8850C00001 (Phase I) 
After a single 300 mg IM dose, the geometric mean Cmax was similar for tixagevimab and cilgavimab at 
16.52 and 15.27 μg/mL, respectively, which was reached at a median tmax of approximately 14 days for 
both antibodies. Between-participant variability (%CV) in tixagevimab AUCinf and Cmax after 300 mg IM 
administration was 29.75% and 35.56%, respectively, and 31.25% and 38.53%, respectively, for 
cilgavimab. The PK of tixagevimab and cilgavimab up to Day 361 were similar. Overall, the Cmax and 
AUC increased linearly with increasing IV dose. Administering tixagevimab and cilgavimab separately or 
together did not alter the PK of the mAbs as indicated by the nearly identical serum drug concentration-
time curves for the two 3000 mg IV dosing regimens.  
In addition, key exposure PK parameters such as AUC and Cmax for tixagevimab and cilgavimab were 
similar between those dosing regimens (see table below).

and 98.8, 111, and 232 ng/mL, respectively, on Day 151. In the 300 mg IV dose cohort, the median 
tixagevimab, cilgavimab, and EVUSHELD NLF concentrations were 315, 331, and 647 ng/mL at Day 8, 
and 182, 150, and 341 ng/mL at Day 151.

Study D8851C00001 (TACKLE) 
TACKLE is an ongoing Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-country, multi-center 
study assessing the safety and efficacy of EVUSHELD for the treatment of COVID-19. The study enrolled 
individuals ≥ 18 years of age who were not hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment and had at least one or 
more COVID-19 symptoms that were at least mild in severity. Treatment was initiated within 3 days of 
obtaining the sample for a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and within ≤ 7 days of COVID-19 symptom 
onset. 
Participants were enrolled into one of 2 independent cohorts: 
•  Cohort 1 (n = approximately 300) underwent more intensive testing to characterize their 
virological and immunological status, and to correlate that status with clinical outcomes. 
•  Cohort 2 (n = up to approximately 1400) is being followed for clinical outcomes.

Blood samples for serum PK analysis were scheduled for collection at pre-dose (baseline), and at Study 
Days 3, 6, 15, 29, 85, 169, and 366 (and option Day 457) in Cohort 1 and at predose (baseline) and at 
Study Days 6, 29, 85, 169, and 366 (and option Day 457) in Cohort 2. 
At the DCO of 14 January 2022, serum AZD8895 and AZD1061 concentration data are available for 442 
participants up to 168 days post-dose, after a single IM dose of AZD7442 600 mg (300 mg AZD8895 + 
300 mg AZD1061) in the ventrogluteal muscle. The study population included subjects with mild-
moderate COVID-19 with median 5 days since symptom onset. 12.8 % of the total study population were 
65 years or older; 43% of subjects were obese. Approximately 2% of subjects had chronic liver or kidney 
disease, respectively. 
Mean (SD) serum concentration-time profiles for tixagevimab and cilgavimab following single dose of 
EVUSHELD 600 mg IM (300 mg tixagevimab + 300 mg cilgavimab, Cohort 1) are shown below.

Administration of 600 mg EVUSHELD – Over Day 28 Period Post-Dose, Cohort 1 – PK Analysis 
Set, TACKLE (Primary Analysis DCO) 
After a single 600 mg IM dose of EVUSHELD, the mean serum concentrations of tixagevimab and 
cilgavimab over time were similar, and as expected based on PK observations in previous studies. The 
observed PK over 84 days post-dose is consistent with the long half-life of EVUSHELD. 
Absorption 
After a 300 mg tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab intramuscular dose in participants with mild to 
moderate COVID-19 in TACKLE, the mean (%CV) maximum concentration (Cmax) was 21.9 (61.7%) and 
20.3 (63.6%) μg/mL for tixagevimab and cilgavimab respectively, which were reached at a median Tmax 
of 15 days. 
Upon request, the applicant presented the time to reach minimum protective concentration (MPC) against 
BA.2 (IC50=35 ng/mL) or BA.4/BA.5 (IC50=65ng/ml) in 50% of subjects (median values for a typical 
patient), based on popPK model using 6.5% and 12% partition ratios and IC90. Furthermore, the model 
predicted time to reach target serum concentration was presented for omicron-subvariants with varying 
estimates: nasal penetration ratio of 1.8% and BA.4/5 IC80 of 260 ng/mL; nasal lining fluid penetration 
ratio of 1.81% and BA.2 IC80 of 89.6 ng/mL; lung penetration ratio of 6.5% and mean BA.2 IC80 of 89.6 
ng/mL; lung penetration ratio of 12% and BA.2 IC80 of 89.6 ng/mL. Time to reach minimum protective 
concentration (MPC) in the TACKLE population is unknown.

Distribution 
Based on PK modelling, the central volume of distribution was 2.72 L for tixagevimab and 2.48 L for 
cilgavimab. The peripheral volume of distribution was 2.64 L for tixagevimab and 2.57 L for cilgavimab.

Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are expected to be degraded into small peptides and component amino acids 
via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG antibodies. 
The clearance (CL) was 0.041 L/day for tixagevimab and 0.041 L/day for cilgavimab with interindividual 
variability of 21% and 29% respectively. The estimated population median terminal elimination half-life 
was 89 days for tixagevimab and 84 days for cilgavimab. 
In TACKLE, following a single intramuscular dose of 300 mg tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab, the 
geometric mean serum concentration was 42.2 μg/mL on Day 29. Based on population PK modelling 
serum trough concentrations 9 months after a single intramuscular dose of 300 mg tixagevimab and 300 
mg cilgavimab, are expected to be equal to serum concentrations at Day 183 following single 
intramuscular dose of 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab. COVID-19 infection did not affect the 
clearance of tixagevimab and cilgavimab. 
Based on population PK modeling, median serum concentrations at 9 months (8.07 ug/mL) after a single 
IM dose of 300 mg tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab are anticipated to be equal to serum 
concentrations at Day 183 (7.78 ug/mL) following a single IM dose of 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg 
cilgavimab.

The post-hoc estimate of clearance based on TACKLE data (600 mg IM) was 0.0522 L/day, which was 
similar to 0.0488 L/day based on PROVENT data (300 mg IM). This 7% higher clearance is not considered 
to be a clinically meaningful effect.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
EVUSHELD exhibited linear PK (Cmax and AUC) across the dose range from 300 mg to 3000 mg IV 
applied in the phase 1 study. 
The PK for the 600 mg IM dose in TACKLE was as expected based on the population PK model informed 
dose-proportional PK of EVUSHELD resulting in exposures approximately 2-fold higher than that observed 
for a 300 mg IM dose.  
Geom. mean Cmax increased less than dose proportional in the between-study comparison considering 
COVID-19 patients in study TACKLE (21.9 µg/mL for AZD8895 and 20.3 µg/ml for AZD1061, respectively) 
compared to healthy subjects with half dose in the phase 1 study (150 mg AZD8895 and 150 mg 
AZD1061 at 16.52 and 15.232 µg/mL, respectively). 
Special populations 
The effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the PK of Evusheld in participants in the TACKLE study has 
not changed from what has been reported in the population PK report that was submitted as part of the 
prophylaxis application. 
Adolescents

There is no new information on adolescents available with this application. There were no adolescents 
recruited to TACKLE. 
The difference between simulated PK profiles (10 trials of 2555 participants) and AUC (0 to 91 days or 3 
months and 0 to 270 days or 9 months) for two groups “All weight” and “Adolescents 40 to 95 kg” are 
presented. Overall, derived AUCs are comparable between these 2 groups at 3 and 9 months; hence, a 
600 mg IM dose does not warrant adjustment for the paediatric patients with a bodyweight > 40 kg and 
age ≥ 12 years. Any marginal increase in exposure in these adolescents compared to adults is considered 
as safe since the exposure safety margin was ~ 22-fold and ~ 65-fold for AUC(0-28) and Cmax, 
respectively for the 600 mg IM dose, based on PK data from TACKLE.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
There is no need to conduct DDI studies with Evusheld as perpetrator based on the elimination 
mechanism and mechanism of action (external target). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
PD (SARS-CoV-2 nAbs), PK-nAbs correlation, and immunogenicity data of EVUSHELD based on 2 clinical 
studies (one Phase I study and one Phase III study) that evaluated EVUSHELD for the treatment of mild 
to moderate COVID-19 in adults (18 years of age and older) were provided. 
Genotypic and phenotypic testing are ongoing to monitor for SARS-CoV-2 spike variants containing 
potential tixagevimab, cilgavimab, and EVUSHELD resistance-associated substitutions in clinical trials. 
These data are available for TACKLE. 
Mechanism of action 
AZD8895 and AZD1061 simultaneously bind to non-overlapping regions of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein. AZD8895 and AZD1061 and AZD7442 as combination product bind to spike protein with 
equilibrium dissociation constants of KD = 2.76 pM, 13.0 pM and 13.7 pM, respectively, blocking its 
interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, resulting in a blockade of virus entry and effective 
neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. AZD8895 and AZD1061 and AZD7442 as combination product 
blocked RBD binding to the human ACE2 receptor with IC50 values of 47.7 ng/mL, 79.6 ng/mL, and 65.0 
ng/mL, respectively. The virus-neutralizing activity of AZD7442 and the two mAbs that comprise it were 
assessed against SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020. AZD7442 had a calculated IC50 value of 10 ng/mL. 
Data demonstrate that AZD8895 and AZD1061 can independently, or in combination (AZD7442), potently 
neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Analysis of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 
D8850C00001 (Phase I) 
Neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 were measured at baseline (Day 1), 7 days (Day 8), 30 
days (Day 31), 60 days (Day 61), 90 days (Day 91), 150 days (Day 151), 210 days (Day 211), and 270 
days (Day 271), and 360 days (Day 361) after administration of AZD7442 in a validated live 
neutralization assay (PRNT80) at Viroclinics. 
All participants receiving AZD7442 exhibited > 4-fold increases in nAb titer compared to baseline at Day 8 
and maintained this increase out to Day 271, with 95% of participants maintaining this increase out to 
Day 361 (2 participants receiving 300 mg IV or IM did not meet this threshold). These results are 
consistent with the expected pharmacodynamic activity of AZD7442 and demonstrate a dose-dependent 
relationship, with the 3000 mg dose cohorts showing approximately 3.3, 15.1, and 27.9 greater fold 
changes than the 1000 mg, 300 mg IV, and 300 mg IM, respectively, on Day 8; 2.7, 9.0, and 13.0 
greater fold changes on Day 151; and 4.3, 10.4, and 13.7 greater fold changes on Day 211, and 4.4, 
12.4, and 10.5 greater fold changes on Day 361. Across all doses and time points evaluated, the levels of 
nAbs exceeded the GMT measured in the same assay in 28 individual convalescent plasma samples.

TACKLE 
Neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 were measured at baseline and after administration of 
AZD7442 or placebo using a validated pseudovirus 50% neutralization assay (Monogram Biosciences). 
Serum samples for evaluation of neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 were collected at 
baseline, and study Day 6, 15, 29, 85, 169, and 366 in Cohort 1, as well as at baseline, and study Day 6, 
29, 85, 169, and 366 in Cohort 2. 
AZD7442-treated participants exhibited > 4-fold increases in nAb titer compared to baseline starting at 
Day 6 and persisting through Day 169. At Day 6, nAb titer increased nearly 60-fold over baseline in the 
AZD7442-treated group compared to a 3.8-fold rise in the placebo group that reflects the natural immune 
response in these participants. Furthermore, increased titer in the AZD7442 group versus the placebo 
group was observed through Day 169: 16-fold; 14-fold, 22-fold, 18-fold, and 5-fold over placebo at Day 
6, 15, 29, 85, and 169, respectively.

Immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies) 
Detection of ADAs against tixagevimab and cilgavimab was conducted utilizing the same tiered approach 
(screen, confirm, titer) using validated MSD-based ECL assays as with previous prophylaxis application 
(PPD Laboratories, Richmond, Virginia). For confirmed positive samples, endpoint titers were determined. 
Data on anti-tixagevimab and anti-cilgavimab nAbs are currently not available but will be provided as 
soon as ready (REC). 
D8850C00001 (Phase I) 
In the Phase I study, blood samples for serum ADA analysis were collected at baseline, and at Post-dose 
Follow-up Days 8, 15, 31, 91, 151, 211, and 361. At the time of final analysis, all 60 participants in the 
study (50 of whom received EVUSHELD and 10 placebo) had a non-missing baseline and at least one 
non-missing post-baseline ADA result. One of 50 participants in the active cohorts tested positive for ADA 
to tixagevimab. The participant was in Cohort 1a (300 mg IM) and had a positive ADA result at Day 361 
only and negative results at all other assessments. The ADA titer was low, at the limit of detection of 80. 
Seven of 50 participants in the active cohorts tested positive for ADA to cilgavimab, 4 in Cohort 1a 
(300 mg IM) and 3 in Cohort 1b (300 mg IV), including the participant who was ADA positive to 
cilgavimab. Using the same definition of TE-ADA positive from TACKLE (either ADA negative at baseline 
and ADA positive at ≥ 1 post-baseline assessments with ADA titer ≥ 2 times higher than the minimum 
required dilution of 80 and 40, for tixagevimab and cilgavimab, respectively, or baseline ADA titer that 
was boosted to ≥ 4-fold during the study period), 1 of 50 participants (2.0%) in the active cohort would 
be classified as TE-ADA positive. All 7 participants had a positive ADA result at Day 361 only and negative 
results at all other assessments. All ADA titers were low, either reported as borderline positive (≤ 40) or 
close to the limit of detection of 40. No participants who received placebo were ADA positive. 
TACKLE 
Blood samples for serum ADA analysis were collected at pre-dose on Day 1, and at Days 28, 84, 168, 
365, and 456 days post-dose in Cohort 1. The bioanalytical analysis for assessing the presence of ADA 
against either AZD8895 or AZD1061 is currently ongoing. At the DCO date of 14 January 2022, ADA data 
up to 168 days post-dose are available for a subset of subjects.

Table 6: Summary of ADA Responses to Tixagevimab and Cilgavimab Following Administration 
of 600 mg IM EVUSHELD Over 168 Days Post-dose – ADA Evaluable Analysis Set, TACKLE DCO 
14 January 2022 
At baseline 4.3% (15/346) of AZD7442 ADA-evaluable participants were positive. The percentage 
increased through Day 169: 10.7% (34/317), 14.5% (36/249), and 22.4% (35/156) at Day 29, Day 85, 
and Day 169, respectively. However, median ADA titer to AZD7442 (defined as the higher of the 2 titers 
of the individual mAbs) did not increase over the same time period: 40.0, 80.0, 40.0 and 80.0 at 
baseline, Day 29, Day 85, and Day 169, respectively.

Figure 10: Individual Serum Concentrations versus Time, by ADA Status and mAb Components 
- PK Analysis Set, TACKLE; DCO 14 January 2022 
Based on available ADA data at the 14 January 2022 DCO, of the 18 participants in the AZD7442 group 
who had reported a primary event of either severe COVID-19 or death, 12 participants were evaluable for 
ADA: 7 were ADA-negative, 2 were non-TE-ADA positive and 3 were TE-ADA+. The remaining 6 
participants with events were not evaluable for ADA due to insufficient data. Two TE-ADA+ participants 
first tested ADA-positive at either Day 29 or Day 169, after the date of event. The other TE-ADA+ 
participant was ADA-positive at baseline and at Day 29, which bracketed the date of primary event. Thus, 
available data show no clear evidence of an association of ADA with impact on efficacy. This observation 
is consistent with the fact that ADA had no clear clinically relevant effect on AZD7442 PK. As such, the 
presence of ADA is not expected to result in loss of efficacy. 
Based on available ADA data at the Secondary DCO, all 4 participants in the AZD7442 group who had 
reported cardiac disorders SOC SAEs and thromboembolic SAEs were ADA-negative, indicating that the 
observed SAEs were not related to the presence of ADA to AZD7442. 
Viral resistance 
Genotypic and phenotypic testing are ongoing to monitor for SARS-CoV-2 spike variants containing 
potential tixagevimab, cilgavimab, and EVUSHELD (tixagevimab and cilgavimab) resistance-associated 
substitutions in TACKLE. The full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike gene is amplified and sequenced using a 
validated assay. The phenotypic impact of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences changes, including 
EVUSHELD binding site substitutions, are evaluated in validated pseudovirus neutralization susceptibility 
assays. Key variants of concern/interest circulating at the time of the studies are further evaluated in 
research-grade authentic live virus neutralization susceptibility assays. 
With the DCO 21 August 2021, sequencing data were available for 834 of 903 participants (413/452 
EVUSHELD and 421/451 placebo) at the baseline visit.

Relative Risk Reduction for Severe COVID-19 or Death through Study Day 29, TACKLE, DCO 14 
January 2022 
At baseline, AZD7442 binding site substitutions at an allele fraction ≥ 25% were observed in in 0.1 to 
29.2% of the participants and were balanced between the AZD7442 and placebo groups. For 14/19 
substitutions, sensitivity to AZD8895 and AZD1061 individually, as well as in combination (AZD7442) was 
tested in vitro using recombinant spike research-grade pseudotyped virus microneutralization assays, and 
in all cases the reduction of susceptibility to AZD7442 was < 10-fold. 
With DCO 14 January 2022, baseline and follow-up SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences were available for 380 
TACKLE participants treated with AZD7442. Treatment-emergent substitutions at an allele fraction ≥ 25% 
(n = 137) were observed in 59/380 participants. The majority of these substitutions were first observed 
at Day 6 following treatment initiation. None of these treatment-emergent substitutions was observed in 
more than 5 participants. The individual impact of 33/137 treatment-emergent substitutions on sensitivity 
to AZD7442 was tested in vitro using pseudovirus neutralization assays, and in all cases the change in 
susceptibility was < 5-fold. 
Treatment-emergent substitutions at an allele fraction 3% to 25% (n = 582) were observed in 121/380 
participants. The majority of these substitutions were first observed at Day 6 following treatment 
initiation. None of these treatment-emergent substitutions was observed in more than 4 participants. The 
individual impact of 112/580 treatment-emergent substitutions on sensitivity to AZD7442 was tested in 
vitro using pseudovirus neutralization assays, and in all cases the change in susceptibility < 5-fold.

The derived median ex vivo IC80 from TACKLE was 28 to 35 ng/mL and close to the in vitro IC80 value of 
40 ng/mL measured in the SARS-CoV-2 original strain microneutralization assay. 
For the exposure-response analysis in TACKLE, exposure (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] 
from 0 to 5 days post dose (AUC(0-5 days)) or from 0 to 28 days post dose (AUC(0-28 days)) was 
derived through Bayesian post-hoc estimates using a 2-compartment population PK model after a single 
600 mg IM dose of EVUSHELD. The population PK model individual predicted AUC (AUC(0-5 days) and 
AUC(0-28 days)) divided in 4 quartiles was correlated to the incidence of severe COVID-19 illness or 
death that occurred by Day 5 and Day 28, respectively.

Dose Justification for Treatment of Mild to Moderate COVID-19 
For the treatment indication, a dose of 600 mg was selected to ensure that high viral cell entry inhibition 
is reached within hours and is maintained for a duration of at least 28 days post dose. This was based on 
the measured in vitro potency of the variants and the understanding of the pharmacokinetics of 
EVUSHELD to maintain drug exposure. These PK and PD properties were used in a viral dynamic model to 
confirm the adequacy of the 600 mg dose selected. 
The developed viral dynamics model was used to describe the TACKLE viral load data and used to support 
the dose selection for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. In total, viral load time-course profiles 
from 750 participants (378 EVUSHELD, 372 placebo) were used for the analysis. The dataset used for the 
analysis consists of a total of 750 participants with their respective EVUSHELD concentration derived from 
previous population PK analysis. However, finally, due to the scarcity in the measurable individual viral 
load data and high variability in the data, the previously described model as part of prophylaxis 
application was used, rather than the parameter estimates based on the TACKLE data.  
A pooled analysis of the spread of observed viral load data (in log10) is depicted below.

of participants for whom data were available at each study day shows the sparse data collection at time 
points after 7 days post-dose.

(post-symptom), the human challenge study mean data for the pre-peak was overlaid as a reference to 
help graphical visualization of overall viral dynamics.

clinical symptoms and start of treatment is shown below. Due to the spread in viral load sampling times, 
the protocol-defined nominal sampling times were used to group adjacent sampling times. The mean and 
standard deviation of viral load was calculated at the nominal days of Day 1, Day 3, and Day 6 (for 
plotting purposes these are moved a day earlier to 0, 2, and 5, respectively, for comparison with 
predictions). The model predictions are at continuous time between Day 0 and Day 7.

First 7 days post Placebo or EVUSHELD Administration 
Due to the mentioned limitation, the viral dynamic model parameter estimates as described in the viral 
dynamic modelling report previously submitted as part of the prophylaxis application were used to 
compare the anti-viral effect of different EVUSHELD doses when infected by either the original SARS-CoV- 
2 strain or the Omicron BA.1 variant. Based on the similarity in the viral load dynamics in nasal swab 
versus epithelial lining fluid, the viral dynamic simulations were conducted to predict the response in the 
lower respiratory tract (Patrucco et al 2020, Goyal et al 2020b). The simulations were conducted using 
the IC50 of 10 ng/mL for the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and 209 ng/mL for the Omicron BA.1 subvariant 
(geometric mean of the first IC50 reported by 4 independent labs), assuming a lower respiratory tract 
penetration of either 6.5% (Chigutsa et al 2022) or 12% (Magyarics et al 2019) and dose of either 300 
mg or 600 mg IM.

The viral dynamics model predicts that the viral load clearance in the symptomatic patient population is 
faster when administering EVUSHELD earlier within the 1 to 7 days post-symptom period. This has been 
confirmed in TACKLE with fewer primary events (severe COVID-19 and death) observed when EVUSHELD 
was dosed within fewer days post symptom onset.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
PK, PD (SARS-CoV-2 nAbs), PK-nAbs correlation, immunogenicity, and antiviral resistance data based on 
2 clinical studies (one Phase I study and one Phase III study) that evaluated Evusheld for the treatment 
of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults (18 years of age and older) were provided with this data 
package. Bioanalytical reports for the determination of AZD8895 and AZD1061 human serum 
concentrations in TACKLE are currently outstanding and should be provided as soon as available (Q4, 
2022) (REC). No updated population PK model has been provided. The pooled population PK analysis 
provided with the initial application included data of 442 Participants with 1473 observations (up to study 
day 85) in the interim PK dataset. An update of pop PK was requested in form of a REC in the context of 
the MAA for prophylaxis indication. 
The applicant presented the final CSR of the phase 1 study D8850C00001 including PK data until day 
361; previously calculated PK parameters only marginally changed with final analysis. The NLF 
concentration data show that both, AZD8895 and AZD1061, distribute significantly into the upper 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 37/130 
 
 
 
 
  
 
respiratory tract up to day 151. The mAb concentrations in NLF increase dose-proportionally in the range 
of 300 mg IV to 3000 mg IV. Individual values varied widely (more than factor 10). 
NLF concentration data were used to determine the partition ratio. It was shown that partition ratio is 
dose-independent, mAb-independent, and time-independent up to day 151. For the prophylactic dose of 
300 mg IM, the median partition from serum to NLF was calculated as 1.81% for AZD7442. Based on the 
results presented, it is reasonable to estimate a similar ratio for the intended higher dose of 600 mg used 
in study TACKLE. 
A higher dose of 600 mg Evusheld (300 mg AZD8895 and 300 mg AZD1061) as compared to the 
prophylaxis indication (150 mg AZD8895 and 150 mg AZD1061) was applied in study TACKLE in the 
treatment of mild-moderate COVID-19. PK data are preliminary and available for 291 participants at day 
169. The sampling scheme in the target population was sparse. 
Based on data from 21 August 2021 DCO (PK data available for up to day 84 from approximately half of 
the subjects), the mean (%CV) maximum concentration (Cmax) was 21.9 (61.7%) and 20.3 (63.6%) 
μg/mL for AZD8895 and AZD1061, respectively, after a 300 mg AZD8895 and 300 mg AZD1061 
intramuscular dose in participants with mild to moderate COVID-19 in TACKLE. As Evusheld 600 mg dose 
IM was not tested in healthy subjects, a direct between-study comparison of PK parameters is not 
possible. In relative terms, geom. mean Cmax was lower in COVID-19 patients in study TACKLE (21.9 
µg/mL for AZD8895 and 20.3 µg/ml for AZD1061, respectively) as would have been expected from data 
in healthy subjects with half dose (150 mg AZD8895 and 150 mg AZD1061 at 16.52 and 15.232 µg/mL, 
respectively). An impact of COVID-19 disease on exposure is not expected and PK was described as dose-
proportional by the popPK model. Thus, this difference might be a result of differences in numbers of 
subjects (N=10 in study 1 receiving 300 mg IM and N=144 in TACKLE receiving 600 mg IM), different 
sampling scheme (more dense in study 1), or due to body weight effect (subjects heavier in TACKLE). 
Median Tmax was reached with approximately Day 15 and was comparable with what has been observed 
in study 1 and phase 3 studies for prophylaxis indication. The average concentration was approximately 
16 µg/ml up to day 28 for each of the 2 mAbs. Between-subject variability (geometric CV%) was high for 
the PK parameters investigated (approximately 62% to 72%). The time to reach minimal protective 
concentration (MPC) based on the TACKLE data and predominant strains (alpha, gamma, delta) at the 
time of the study have not been provided explicitly. Based on the IC50 level, however, time to reach MPC 
is not expected to exceed that calculated for BA.2 (~ 8 h, expected value to be reached by 50% of the 
patients). Unfortunately, no range has been calculated for the time to reach MPC, or, in other words, time 
to reach MPC has only been stated for the median (50% of subjects to reach) and not for a higher % of 
subjects to reach MPC. 
The distribution, metabolism, and elimination attributes of Evusheld, have not changed from what has 
been reported in the Population PK Report that was submitted as part of the prophylaxis application. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
The effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the PK of Evusheld in participants in the TACKLE study has 
not changed from what has been reported in the population PK Report that was submitted as part of the 
prophylaxis application. 
No adolescent PK data are available from Evusheld clinical trial program so far, however, adolescents 
aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg are included in the proposed indication for COVID-19 
treatment. Due to the lower body weight, and the fix dose regimen, slightly higher exposure is expected 
for the adolescent subpopulation. However, considering the broad safety margins of the 600 mg dose 
based on preclinical and phase 1 human studies, it is agreed that a slightly higher exposure will 
presumably not result in safety problems. A weight range of 40-95 kg was assumed for adolescents. In 
study TACKLE, the median (min-max) body weight was 78.4 (45.0-160.0) kg in the Evusheld group. In 
the lower weight groups, 600 mg Evusheld were administered without known safety problems. The weight 
range of subjects that provided data for pop PK modelling was from 40.8 kg. 
As discussed in the prophylaxis application, paediatric dosing of adolescent patients aged 12 years or 
older and weighing at least 40 kg based on exposure matching with adult exposure is endorsed.

Acceptable simulations for adolescents based on the previously developed popPK model have been 
presented.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology 
In the FITH study D8850C00001, > 4-fold increases in neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 
compared to baseline were obtained at Day 8 and maintained out to Day 271, with 95% of participants 
maintaining this increase out to Day 361 (2 participants receiving 300 mg IV or IM did not meet this 
threshold). For the TACKLE trial, preliminary results on neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 
were presented up to Day 366 after administration of Evusheld. Results until day 29 are considered to be 
the most relevant time frame for the treatment indication (long-term effect rather relevant for 
prophylaxis). On days 6, 15, and 29, median neutralizing titers in AZD7442 treated subjects were clearly 
above placebo level, however, titers in placebo treated subjects varied widely (difference in endogenous 
response to infection). For treatment of an active infection, a fast onset of PD effect is considered 
important. According to data on neutralising antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 presented starting from 
day 6 after treatment, this condition cannot be really assessed. Overall, it is accepted that the studies 
have shown a satisfactory PD response. 
Immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies) 
Current results on development of ADA against either AZD8895 or AZD1061 confirm that there is a rather 
low risk for immunogenicity. 
ADA measurements from patient study TACKLE are ongoing; ADA data to Evusheld are available for a 
subset of 307 AZD7442 subjects up to day 168. The number of subjects ADA positive at baseline was 
15/346 (4.3%) and thus, rather low. ADA prevalence (positive at any visit) was N=26 (7.6 %) in the 
placebo group and thus above the targeted 1% false-positive rate of the confirmatory assays. ADA 
prevalence and ADA incidence of Evusheld in the Evusheld group were 25.7 % (89/346) and 10.7% 
(37/346), respectively. The percentage of ADA-evaluable participants increased over time through day 
169, while median ADA titers remained to be low and comparable to titers seen with placebo. For the 
treatment of an acute infection with a single application, the impact of ADAs at later time points is 
deemed to be of minor relevance for PK and efficacy. For TE-ADA positive subjects, serum AZD8895 and 
AZD1061 concentrations were within the range of those in participants negative for ADA. The limited 
information on efficacy and safety in ADA positive subjects does not raise a certain concern. Thus, 
overall, no clinically relevant impact of ADAs on PK, efficacy and safety in COVID-19 patients with mild-
moderate disease is expected based on preliminary data available so far.  
Viral resistance 
Genotypic and phenotypic testing are ongoing to monitor for SARS-CoV-2 spike variants containing 
potential AZD8895, AZD1061, and Evusheld (AZD8895 and AZD1061) resistance-associated substitutions 
in TACKLE. With the data package provided, the majority (834 of 903) of subjects were virally sequenced 
at baseline, with alpha (n=258) being the predominant form at the time of study conduct. Prevalence of 
variants of concern and variants of interest was balanced between both treatment groups. No clinical data 
on variant omicron are available from AZD clinical trial program so far. 
Numbers of primary endpoint events were presented by variant of concern/ variant of interest together 
with relative risk reduction. For delta variant, relative risk reduction (RRR% (95% CI): 70.64 (-107.42, 
95.84)) was higher compared to overall population (see section 5.4 on clinical efficacy). In contrast, there 
was no relevant effect of Evusheld on clinical outcome in subjects infected with alpha variant (RRR% 
(95% CI): 16.00 (-134.74, 69.94)). However, alpha variant was not associated with reduced 
susceptibility in non-clinical assays. The clinical data set is too small to draw conclusion on potential loss 
of efficacy; further data are not expected as alpha is superseded by other strains. Thus, the issue is not 
Assessment report

Page 39/130 
 
 
 
 
further pursued in the present procedure. The discussion on significance of in vitro susceptibility assays 
and how their results might translate in clinical effects is currently ongoing and of relevance for recent 
and upcoming variants. Overall, the study was not designed to detect treatment differences with high 
statistical power within subgroups infected with certain viral variants. 
With DCO 14 January 2022, results on SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences after AZD7442 treatment were 
available for 380 TACKLE participants. Treatment-emergent substitutions at an allele fraction ≥ 25% were 
observed in 59/380 participants, with change in susceptibility < 5-fold in all cases. Most of the 
substitutions were observed as early as day 6 and none of them was observed in more than 5 
participants. Although treatment-emergent substitutions were detected in a relevant number of subjects, 
the modest change in susceptibility seen in vitro and the diversity of detected substitutions does not point 
towards a strong selection of mutations in the AZD7442 binding site. Thus, data available so far do not 
raise a strong concern regarding development of Evusheld-resistant escape mutants. 
Overall, information on potential viral resistance from clinical trials is limited. The risk of viral resistance 
will be adequately addressed post approval by “other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities for 
lack of efficacy”. 
PK/PD modelling 
A good correlation between plasma concentration and 80% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers was 
expected (as kind of concept proof) and is seen with data from TACKLE as well as final data from study 
D8850C00001 (Phase I) with 1-year follow up. 
An exposure-response analysis for efficacy has been conducted with 600 mg data from study TACKLE: PK 
model individual predicted AUCs divided in 4 quartiles were correlated to the incidence of severe COVID-
19 or death that occurred by Day 5 and Day 28 (primary endpoint). There was no statistically significant 
effect of exposure on the outcome of severe symptoms or death within 5 or 28 days post start of 
treatment. Thus, it might be concluded that the differences seen in exposure within the proposed dose of 
600 mg did not have an effect on efficacy. However, it needs to be emphasised that numbers in this 
analysis were overall low.  
No dose-exposure-response analysis for safety has been conducted with data from TACKLE. As Evusheld 
aims at an exogenous target, no target-related AEs are expected. For safety parameters investigated 
(e.g., systemic hypersensitivity, SAEs by PT, deaths), incidence was low and exposure-safety analyses 
are not expected to be robust. Thus, it is acceptable not to perform exposure-safety analyses for safety 
endpoints. 
Dose Justification for Treatment of Mild to Moderate COVID-19 
The 600 mg IM dose was the only dose applied in COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease within 
the clinical trial program. A viral dynamics model (VDM) was developed and utilised to confirm the 
adequacy of the 600 mg dose selected. 
The previously developed final VDM structure (submitted as part of the prophylaxis application) was used 
as the structural model to describe the viral load data collected in the TACKLE study (with and without 
administration of Evusheld). The VDM has been validated by comparing the predicted mean viral load 
through the VDM to the observed viral dynamics in a human challenge study (Killingly et al 2022). There 
was a reasonably good concordance between the shape and magnitude of the predicted and observed 
viral load in the rising and declining phase of the curve. The dataset of TACKLE study used for the 
analysis consists of a total of 750 participants with their respective Evusheld concentration derived from 
population PK analysis and their viral load time-course profiles. However, due to frequent BLQ data, most 
of the participants had only 1 or 2 detectable viral load data and high variability in data was observed. 
Therefore, the applicant decided not to use the obtained parameter estimates for simulations (e.g., for 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 40/130 
 
 
 
 
virus variants) but to use parameter estimates obtained for the VDM as previously described in the VDM 
Report submitted as part of the prophylaxis application.  
Viral dynamic simulations were conducted to predict the response to Evusheld treatment in the lower 
respiratory tract. It is agreed that the lower respiratory tract is the relevant site of action for prevention 
of severe COVID-19 or death (treatment objective in patients with mild-moderate disease). Data from 
literature was consulted, assuming a lower respiratory tract penetration of anti-infective mAbs of either 
6.5% (Chigutsa et al 2022) or 12% (Magyarics et al 2019). Furthermore, an IC50 of 10 ng/mL for the 
original SARS-CoV-2 strain and of 209 ng/mL for the Omicron BA.1 subvariant (geometric mean of the 
first IC50 reported by 4 independent labs) was used. As discussed extensively within the Evusheld 
prophylaxis application, there is some degree of uncertainty in these estimates (lower respiratory tract 
penetration rate not based on own data; high variability in in vitro experiments for determination of IC50; 
appropriateness of IC80 instead of IC90). Thus, all model-based simulations in particular based on viral 
load data (PD marker) should be interpreted with caution and serve as supportive information only. 
Worst-case simulation scenarios have been requested to explore the impact of these variabilities on the 
minimum effective concentration to be reached. As long as the VDM model was not deemed qualified, the 
IC90 in vivo values was regarded appropriate to be considered. There are outstanding RECs from the 
prophylaxis setting of relevance for this variation (see updated REC letter in the appendix).  
The applicant presented predictions on viral load time-course after treatment with a 600 or 1200 mg IM 
dose 10 days post infection: Simulations indicate that Evusheld’s effect on viral course is regardless of 
the dose applied. The applicant further states that in the treatment setting, Evusheld is expected to be 
dosed after peak viral load and the viral production rate will progressively reduce over time due to 
endogenous immune response and thus, the maximal achievable effect by AZD7442 can be achieved at 
progressively lower doses with ongoing infection. Thus, theoretical considerations as well as model 
predictions on viral load do not fully support selection of a higher dose (600mg) compared to the 
prophylaxis setting (300mg), where administration is performed before peak viral load is achieved. 
However, as no additional safety signals were detected by the use of the 600 mg IM dose in the pivotal 
study, the chosen dose may be acceptable, also under consideration of the potentially reduced 
susceptibility of (future) viral variants.  
Nevertheless, the long-lasting high serum concentrations resulting from 600 mg IM dose are not required 
for the acute treatment of mild-moderate COVID-19 and data on its impact on active SARS-CoV-2 
immunisation are outstanding. A potentially resulting delay in COVID-19 vaccination is seen critical, 
especially in patients at high risk for progression to severe disease. As a data-based decision for the best 
timing of vaccination following Evusheld treatment is currently not feasible, this will be a matter of 
national/local recommendations. 
Based on simulation provided within the prophylaxis application using the same estimates as presented 
here, it is acknowledged that the 600 mg IM dose will likely result in efficacious Evusheld level in the high 
majority of omicron BA.1-infected subjects within the first month after treatment. With his responses, the 
applicant presented the model predicted time to reach target serum concentration for omicron-
subvariants (BA.2, BA.4/BA.5) with varying estimates for IC50 values and lung penetration rate. Based 
on the presented data for BA.4/BA.5, 50% of the subject are predicted to reach efficacious target level in 
less than 24h with the 600 mg dose (assuming 6.5% lung partition ratio and IC90 based on 
IC50=65 ng/mL). This may be acceptable for treatment of an acute infectious disease. 
The applicant’s plan to conduct continuous reviews post-authorisation of genomic databases such as 
GISAID for emerging Variants of Interest and Variants of Concern and subsequent phenotypic evaluation 
by use of in vitro assays is supported.

2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The data package on pharmacokinetics is overall deemed sufficient to characterize the PK of AZD8895, 
AZD1061, and Evusheld (combination of both mAbs) in COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease.  
PK data and pop PK data analysis indicate linear and approximately dose proportional PK over the dose 
ranges studied with regard to both monoclonal antibodies AZD8895 and AZD1061, respectively (300 mg 
to 3000 mg IV, 300 mg and 600 mg IM). Obtained PK parameters are in line with what would have been 
expected for mAbs with exogenous target and half-life extension. 
Paediatric dosing of adolescent patients aged 12 years or older and weighing at least 40 kg based on 
exposure matching with adult exposure can be agreed. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Clinical data on neutralising SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer indicate that sufficiently high values for a 
treatment effect against original virus strain was obtained. A good correlation between Evusheld plasma 
concentration and ex vivo 80% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers was expected (as kind of concept 
proof) and is seen with clinical data. 
Presented data on immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies) do not raise concern.  
Viral sequencing data from the TACKLE study are too limited to allow conclusion on clinical efficacy in 
treatment against certain VOC/VOI. No clinical data on latest VOC (including omicron sub-variants) are 
available. The risk of viral resistance will be addressed post approval by “other forms of routine 
pharmacovigilance activities for lack of efficacy”.  
The chosen dose of 600 mg Evusheld IM for the treatment of mild-moderate COVID-19 is not fully 
supported by theoretical considerations as well as model predictions on viral load. The expected long-
lasting high serum concentrations resulting from 600 mg IM dose are not required for the acute 
treatment of mild-moderate COVID-19. However, as no additional safety signals were detected by the use 
of the 600 mg IM dose in the pivotal study, the chosen dose may be acceptable, also under consideration 
of the potentially reduced susceptibility of (future) viral variants. 
There is a theoretical risk for PD interaction of Evusheld with COVID-19 vaccines (impaired cellular or 
humoral immune response) that has not been addressed in clinical trials. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to pharmacology: 
•  Bioanalytical reports for the determination of AZD8895 and AZD1061 human serum 
concentrations in TACKLE are currently outstanding and should be provided as soon as available 
(Q4, 2022) (REC). 
• 
The final CSR for the TACKLE study should be provided as soon as available (REC).

2.4.2.  Main study 
A Phase III Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Study 
to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of AZD7442 for the Treatment of COVID-
19 in Non-hospitalized Adults (TACKLE; D8851C00001) 
Methods 
TACKLE is an ongoing Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the safety 
and efficacy of a single dose of EVUSHELD (× 2 sequential IM injections) compared to placebo for the 
treatment of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized adults. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive a single 
dose (× 2 IM injections) of EVUSHELD 600 mg IM or placebo on Day 1, and thereafter undergo follow-up 
for 15 months (until Day 457). 
Figure 19. TACKLE, study schematic 
The study is ongoing and is being conducted at 95 sites across 14 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Czech 
Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russian Federation, Spain, UK, Ukraine, and 
USA). 
Study participants 
Participants were outpatient adults (≥ 18 years) with a documented positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test 
(antigen or nucleic acid) from a sample collected ≤ 3 days prior to study entry and with ≤ 7 days of 
symptoms of COVID-19 at study entry (‘Day 1’ symptom count starts from the first day of symptoms), 
plus the presence of select symptoms within 24 hours prior to Day 1. At least 60% of participants were to 
meet the protocol definition of being at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19 as defined by any of 
the following: 
• 
Persons aged 65 years and older at randomization 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 43/130 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Persons aged < 65 years and having at least one of the following conditions: 
o  Cancer 
o  Chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma

It was planned that the first 20 participants dosed (approximately 10 planned in the AZD7442 group and 
10 planned to placebo) formed a sentinel group. After the entire sentinel group was dosed, further 
enrolment was paused until the sentinel group’s safety data through Day 8 was reviewed by the DSMB in 
order to provide a recommendation to continue or to halt dosing of additional participants. 
Participants were enrolled into one of 2 independent cohorts: 
•  Cohort 1 (n = approximately 300), which included the sentinel group, underwent more intensive 
testing to characterize their virological and immunological status, and to correlate that status with 
clinical outcomes. 
•  Cohort 2 (n = up to approximately 1400) is being followed for clinical outcomes.

Sample size 
Up to approximately 1700 participants, allowing for variability of the placebo group's primary endpoint 
event rate, were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single IM 600 mg dose of AZD7442 
(n = up to approximately 850) or placebo (n = up to approximately 850) on Day 1. At least 60% of 
participants were required to meet the protocol definition of being at high-risk of progression to severe 
COVID-19.  
Published study results (Lilly BLAZE-1 2021 and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. REGENCOV Outpatient 
Trial 2021) from Phase III trials testing monoclonal antibody drug products in non-hospitalized COVID-19 
participants have shown efficacy > 70% in a high-risk population. In these studies, attack rates in the 
placebo arms have been observed to range from 4.6% to 5.8%. As this study is conducted in a 
population of participants of both high- and low-risk for progression to severe disease or death, an 
expected efficacy of 65%, and an attack rate in the placebo group of 4.6% were assumed.  
This is an event-driven study with a primary analysis initiated 30 days after 43 primary endpoint events 
had occurred. The study was planned to have 90% power to detect a relative reduction of 65% in the 
incidence of severe COVID-19/death between the study groups (AZD7442 versus placebo), assuming the 
incidence of severe COVID-19/death in the placebo group was 4.6%. This was considered plausible based 
on evolving surveillance information from various sources. 
Randomisation 
All participants were centrally assigned to randomized IMP using an IRT. Before the study was initiated, 
user guides, the log in information, and directions for the IRT were provided to each study site. 
Randomization was stratified (using centralized blocked randomization) by: 
1.  Time from symptom onset (≤ 5 days versus > 5 days). 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 52/130 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  High risk versus low risk of progression to severe COVID-19. 
Blinding (masking) 
Neither the participant nor any of the Investigators or Sponsor staff who have been involved in the 
treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the participants have been aware of the study 
intervention received. Since AZD7442 and placebo were visually distinct prior to dose preparation (due to 
differences in container closure), IMP was handled by an unblinded pharmacist (or designee, in 
accordance with local and institutional regulations) at the study site. Syringe masking was required in 
order to maintain the blind. 
The primary analysis was carried out by an unblinded analysis team, and the procedure to maintain the 
integrity of the study blinding is detailed in the Study Integrity Plan. 
During the study, when participants become eligible for access to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, it is appropriate 
that they can discuss with the investigator and others after Day 30 so as to make an informed choice. 
Participants may wish to be vaccinated. If so, they may be unblinded as to their randomized 
investigational treatment in this study. The Investigator was to document and report the action to the 
Sponsor, without revealing the treatment given to the participant to the Sponsor staff.  
In case of an emergency, in which the knowledge of the specific blinded IMP could affect the immediate 
management of the participant’s condition (eg, antidote available), the Investigator has the sole 
responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants’ IMP assignment is to be warranted. 
Participant safety has always been the first consideration in making such a determination. If a 
participant’s IMP assignment was unblinded, the Sponsor had to be notified within 24 hours after 
breaking the blind. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint is a composite of either severe COVID-19 or death from any cause through 
Day 29. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a minimum of either pneumonia (fever, cough, tachypnea, 
or dyspnea, AND lung infiltrates) or hypoxemia (SpO2 < 90% in room air and/or severe respiratory 
distress) and a WHO Clinical Progression Scale score of 5 or higher. 
The primary estimand was planned to be based on participants in the modified full analysis set defined in 
the below table. The set of intercurrent events for this estimand was planned to consist of receipt of an 
experimental or approved COVID-19 treatment product prior to Day 29 without already having met the 
primary efficacy endpoint. The set of intercurrent events was planned to be handled following the 
treatment policy strategy, meaning data collected after an intercurrent event was planned to be analyzed 
as observed. Absence of data following participants’ withdrawal/lost to follow-up prior to having met the 
primary efficacy endpoint was planned to be treated as missing. Participants were planned to be 
considered as not having the event through the time of last observation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 53/130 
 
 
 
 
For the primary efficacy analysis, the stratified CMH method (by the stratification factors) was planned to  
be used. The RR was planned to be estimated by the CMH method, and the efficacy was planned to be 
calculated as the RRR = 100 × (1−RR), which represents the percent reduction in incidence of severe 
COVID-19 or death from any cause in the AZD7442 group relative to the placebo group. The 95% 2-sided 
CI was planned to be presented. Participants who do not have an event and do not remain in the study 
until the Day 29 assessment, were planned to be treated as having a missing primary endpoint. 
The following alternative estimands for the primary efficacy population were planned to be conducted and 
included in the hierarchical testing methodology: 
1.  First supportive estimand 
Analysis to be conducted in the early intervention analysis set, with all other components of the primary 
estimand remaining the same. 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 54/130 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  Second supportive estimand 
Analysis to be conducted in the modified full analysis set and only considering events occurring from Day 
4 through Day 29, with all other components of the primary estimand remaining the same. Participants 
with events occurring prior to Day 4 to be considered not experiencing an event. 
3.  Third supportive estimand 
Analysis to be conducted in the full analysis set, with all other components of the primary estimand 
remaining the same. 
4.  Fourth supportive estimand 
Analysis to be conducted in the seronegative analysis set, with all other components of the primary 
estimand remaining the same. 
A hierarchical approach was planned to be used to control multiplicity for the primary estimand, 
supportive estimands, and key secondary efficacy endpoint. That is, the null hypotheses for the efficacy 
endpoints was planned to be tested in a hierarchical order, and the subsequent null hypothesis was 
planned to be tested only if the prior null hypothesis is rejected. The supportive estimands were planned 
to be tested only if the primary estimand null hypothesis is rejected and was planned to be tested in the 
order presented above (primary estimand, first to fourth supportive estimand). The key secondary 
efficacy endpoint was planned to be only be tested once, when all enrolled participants have been 
followed through Day 169, and if all higher ordered null hypotheses have been rejected. For any null 
hypothesis that fails to be rejected, all subsequent p-values were planned to be considered nominal. 
The key secondary endpoint is a composite of either death from any cause or hospitalization for COVID-
19 complications or sequelae during the 168-day post-dose period (Day 1 to Day 169) and was planned 
to be analyzed in participants in the modified full analysis set. 
For the analysis of the key secondary endpoint, the set of intercurrent events for the estimand was 
planned to consist of receipt of an experimental or approved COVID-19 treatment product, or becoming 
unblinded to properly consider vaccination for COVID-19, prior to Day 169 without already having met 
the key secondary efficacy endpoint. The set of intercurrent events was planned to be handled following 
the treatment policy strategy, meaning data collected after an intercurrent event were planned to be 
analyzed as observed. Absence of data following participants’ withdrawal/lost to follow-up prior to having 
met the key secondary efficacy endpoint was planned to be treated as missing. 
Participants were planned to be considered as not having the event through the time of last observation. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was planned to be analyzed as described for the primary efficacy 
analysis. The analysis was to be conducted once, when all participants complete their Day 169 visit. The 
point estimate of the RRR of the key secondary endpoint by AZD7442 compared to placebo, as well as the 
95% CI, were planned to be calculated and reported following the same methodology as described for the 
primary efficacy analysis.  
To support the primary analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves for time to severe COVID-19 or death from any 
cause during the first 28 days of follow-up were planned to be generated for each randomized group. A 
stratified Log-Rank test was planned to be conducted. A Cox-Proportional Hazards model was planned to 
be conducted to obtain hazard ratios and their respective 95% CIs. The stratification factors were planned 
to be included as covariates in the Cox model. Absence of data following participants’ withdrawal/lost to 
follow-up was planned to be treated as missing and censored at the date of last known status. 
Additionally, the absolute risk reduction of AZD7442 with respect to placebo in preventing severe COVID-
19 or death from any cause at Day 29, was planned to be presented, along with the 2-sided 95% CI 
using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s score method.

Treatment with AZD7442 compared with placebo led to a 50.49% (95% CI: 14.56 to 71.31) RRR for 
developing severe COVID-19 or death from any cause in non-hospitalized adults who had been 
symptomatic for 7 days or less. Rejection of the null hypothesis for the primary objective initiated 
sequential testing of the supporting estimands. The study achieved statistically significant results in all 
supportive estimands.

The results of the primary composite endpoint were driven by the incidence of severe COVID-19. Up to 
Day 29, 7 deaths had been reported, 3 in the EVUSHELD arm and 4 in the placebo arm. Of the 7 deaths, 
2 were not COVID-19 related. Both of these were in the EVUSHELD arm and contributed to the primary 
composite endpoint. 
Non-responder Sensitivity Analysis 
Participants who discontinued or were lost to follow-up prior to their Day 29 visit, had the primary 
endpoint imputed as an event.

Additional Sensitivity Analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis repeated with the covariates for region and continuous time from symptom 
onset, separately, were consistent with the primary analysis. When further stratified by region, a RRR 
46.50% (95% CI: 6.27, 69.46); p-value 0.025 was observed. Using a logistic regression including 
continuous time from symptom onset, an Odds Ratio of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.85); p-value 0.0116 was 
observed. 
The repeated analysis at the Key Secondary DCO (14 January 2022) was in line with the Primary DCO 
analysis, showing treatment with AZD7442 compared to placebo led to a 50.38% (95% CI: 14.38, 71.25) 
reduction in the risk of developing severe COVID-19 or death from any cause in non-hospitalized adults 
who had been symptomatic for 7 days or less. The small numerical changes seen were due to updates to 
the database after the Primary DCO eg, participants completing their Day 29 visit after the Primary DCO. 
At the Primary DCO and Key Secondary DCO, supplemental analysis by Cox regression of time to first 
event of severe COVID-19 or death from any cause through Day 29 were similar, Hazard Ratio 0.49 (95% 
CI: 0.28, 0.86); p-value 0.0123 and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.85); p-value 0.0122.

Derived from Table 14.2.8.1 
COVID-19 Symptom Severity Assessments Based on Symptom Severity Scores over Time up to Day 29 
Treatment with EVUSHELD, compared to placebo, reduced the severity of cough (LS mean difference -
0.05 [95% CI -0.10, -0.01]) and muscle ache symptoms (LS mean difference -0.05 [95% CI -0.09, -
0.01]). There was no difference between EVUSHELD and placebo treatment groups for other assessed 
symptoms. Symptom severity data were derived from self-reported E-diary data. As this was not 
collected for those participants who went on to be hospitalized, missing data may have affected these 
analyses; as such, these data should be interpreted accordingly.

Differences in Symptom Duration Between Groups 
A separation of the return to usual health Kaplan-Meier curves favoring AZD7442 is apparent on visual 
inspection, however, there was no statistical difference (p-value 0.1499) in time to return to usual health 
by Day 29 in the AZD7442 group compared to the placebo group. The lack of statistical difference may 
reflect anchoring to Day 15 and Day 29 visits, which results in overlap of the curve at Day 29.

Detection, Level, and Change from Baseline of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from Nasal Swabs Through Day 29 
The change from baseline of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and RNA levels from nasal swabs at each treatment visit 
through Day 29 are presented for 2 cohorts with differing sampling schedules. In Cohort 1 (Virology 
Analysis Set), samples were taken at baseline and Day 3, 6, 15, and 29. In Cohort 2, samples were taken 
at baseline, Day 6, and Day 29. 
In Cohort 1, treatment with AZD7442 compared with placebo resulted in numerically greater reductions in 
log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA mean change from baseline at Day 3 (LS mean difference -0.28 [95% CI: -0.64, 
0.09]) and Day 6 (LS mean difference -0.48 [95% CI: -0.76, -0.20]). No difference was observed at day 
15 (LS Mean Difference -0.05 [95% CI -0.28, -0.18]) and day 29 (LS Mean Difference -0.03 [95% CI -
0.20, -0.25]). 
Overall (Cohorts 1 and 2, analyzed at Day 6 and Day 29 only), treatment with AZD7442 compared with 
placebo resulted in greater reductions in log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA mean change from baseline at Day 6 (LS 
mean difference -0.39 [95% CI: -0.56 to -0.22]). No difference was observed at day 29 (LS Mean 
Difference 0.02 [95% CI -0.02, -0.07]).

Exploratory endpoints 
SARS-CoV-2 positivity through Day 29 among household contacts for participants that had at least 
one contact was lower for participants in the AZD7442 group (34 [8.2%]) compared to placebo group (43 
[10.2%]). 
There were 416/452 (92.0%) participants with a post-treatment response for SARS-CoV-2 
nucleocapsid antibodies in the AZD7442 group compared to 404/451 (89.6%) participants in the 
placebo group. 
Changes in the Hospital Course Once a Participant Required Hospitalization: The number of 
participants hospitalized for the disease under study (including COVID-19 complications) through Day 29 
was numerically fewer in the AZD7442 group (17 [4.1%]) compared with the placebo group (40 [9.5%]). 
The lower number of hospitalizations in participants treated with AZD7442 was accounted for by fewer 
hospitalizations in the categories: In-patient hospital setting, ER admission > 24 hours, and Acute 
hospital care at home. Of these hospitalized participants, fewer were admitted to the ICU in the AZD7442 
group (3 [0.7%]) compared to placebo (11 [2.6%]).  
Among participants hospitalized for COVID-19 complications or sequelae the mean (SD) duration of 
hospital admission was 14.9 (10.83) days for the AZD7442 group and 11.6 (6.33) days for the placebo 
group. For participants admitted to ICU for COVID-19 complications the mean admission time was 8.3 
(0.58) days for AZD7442 group and 8.8 (3.43) days for AZD7442.  
The worst clinical status (assessed using ordinal scale among participants who become hospitalized) 
among participants who were hospitalized for disease under study was similar between the AZD7442 
group and placebo group.

Results were from a CMH test with stratification factors used in the primary analysis. For the subgroup of 
time from symptom onset or risk group, time from symptom onset or risk of progression was not a 
stratification factor. For the subgroups of age, risk of progression was not a stratification factor. If there 
was no stratification factor, a chi-square test was used.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of Evusheld for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults with mild-moderate disease was 
investigated in TACKLE, an ongoing Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. As 
further discussed in the Pharmacology section of this report, double the dose (2x300 mg) as approved for 
the prophylaxis indication (2x150mg) was applied. The use of placebo as comparator is endorsed in the 
studied population as the study started the recruitment in January 2021 where no approved treatment of 
mild-moderate disease was available. Overall, the chosen study design is deemed appropriate. 
In order to meet the entry criteria for mild-moderate COVID-19, patients had to have (1) a documented 
positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test (antigen or nucleic acid) from a sample collected ≤ 3 days prior to 
study entry; (2) ≤7 days of symptoms of COVID-19 at study entry; (3) selected self-reported symptoms 
within 24 hours prior to Day 1; (4) WHO Clinical Progression Scale score 2 or 3; (5) oxygenation 
saturation of ≥ 92% at rest within 24 hours prior to Day 1; (6) non-hospitalized state. Overall, the 
applied patient characteristics are largely in line with FDA guidance (COVID-19: Developing Drugs and 
Biological Products for Treatment or Prevention) definition of mild or moderate COVID-19, as patients had 
to be symptomatic (including possible shortness of breath) but without severely impaired oxygen 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 82/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
saturation (≥ 92%). Adolescents, pregnant and breast-feeding women as well as previously SARS-CoV-2 
vaccinated subjects were excluded. Overall, the chosen population seems adequate for investigation of a 
treatment effect in adult patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. 
At least 60% of the subjects had to be of increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19. The chosen 
definition of high-risk is in line with current knowledge and deemed appropriate. Stratified recruitment 
(meaning at least 60% high risk patients) is in principle supported but may limit information in patients 
without documented risk factors.  
Additional treatment for COVID-19 was only allowed in case of hospitalization due to clinical worsening 
and with approved or licensed (emergency use) products only. Other treatment for COVID-19 prior to day 
29 was defined as intercurrent event and handled by policy strategy, which is deemed appropriate. 
As primary endpoint, a composite of either severe COVID-19 or death from any cause through day 29 
was applied. This is acceptable as it is a relevant measure of overall clinical status and in line with current 
CHMP recommendations for pivotal studies investigating treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in a 
non-hospitalised setting. Severe COVID-19 was defined as selected symptoms of pneumonia (always in 
combination with lung-infiltrates) or signs of hypoxia plus score ≥5 on WHO COVID-19 progression scale, 
which requires hospitalisation and at least oxygen support by mask. Thereby, hospitalisation was defined 
as ≥ 24 hours of acute care, in a hospital or similar acute care facility. The combination of these 
requirements for definition of “severe” is deemed largely objective, however, regional or individual site 
differences (e.g., in admission to hospital/use of oxygen/diagnostics) that might potentially affect primary 
endpoint analysis cannot entirely be excluded.  
The key secondary endpoint investigates the composite of either death from any cause or hospitalization 
for COVID-19 complications or sequelae through day 169 and thus, captured longer-term outcomes. No 
precise definition of “COVID-19 complications or sequelae” could be found in the submission package. It 
is presumed that this was based on investigators decision. Furthermore, it can be interpreted from the 
protocol that stroke, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolic disease should be counted as such 
events of COVID-19 complications or sequelae, which is endorsed.  
The other secondary endpoints supplement the efficacy analyses by day 29 by investigation of respiratory 
failure, symptom severity, progression, and duration as well as viral load (SARS-CoV-2 RNA) reduction. 
For the secondary endpoint “Incidence of respiratory failure through day 29”, respiratory failure was 
defined as requirement for mechanical ventilation, ECMO, non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow nasal 
cannula oxygen delivery. Symptom assessments for secondary endpoints are based on daily use of 37 
questions in a self-reported symptom diary. No information is available on validation of the PRO 
instrument. Additional investigation of viral load might be informative for assessment of infectivity of the 
patient but not for clinical outcome per se as it is no established surrogate for efficacy. 
The study was planned to enrol 1700 patients, in order to have 90% power to detect a relative reduction 
of 65% in the incidence of severe COVID-19/death between the study groups (AZD7442 versus placebo), 
assuming the incidence of severe COVID-19/death in the placebo group was 4.6%. Several design 
aspects have been amended during the ongoing study. This includes the changes to the alpha spending 
for the initially planned interim analysis, removal of the interim analysis, changes to the primary analysis 
model, reduction of the planned number of events for the event-driven analysis (and power, accordingly). 
Thus, although the sample size seems is acceptable, there is uncertainty how these changes might have 
affected results. It is evident that the study was planned and conducted with relevant uncertainty. 
Double blinding is endorsed. Unblinding for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was only possible after day 30 was 
reached in the individual subject. Thus, influence on the primary endpoint and all other secondary 
endpoints investigating events until day 29 should be negligible. However, the key-secondary endpoint 
Assessment report

Page 83/130 
 
 
 
 
death from any cause or hospitalization for COVID-19 complications or sequelae during the 168-day post-
dose period (Day 1 to Day 169) may be affected by this unblinding, or by vaccination of subjects.  
The primary analysis strategy is overall acceptable, but some uncertainties remain. The analysis plan was 
amended several times throughout the study, including changes to the timing of analyses, interim 
analyses, primary analysis model and multiplicity adjustment. This is considered to reflect uncertainty 
during the pandemic and is understood. 
The primary analysis population is restricted to subjects not hospitalized and with time from symptom 
onset to treatment initiation ≤ 7 days. This is not fully in line with the intention to treat principle, and it is 
not entirely clear why a broader population was included, and the analysis was restricted. Accordingly, 
the primary estimand does not seem to be fully in line with a treatment policy estimand. 
The third supportive estimand includes the entire FAS, and this is endorsed. Consistency of the primary 
results with results targeting the third supportive estimand provides reassurance. In fact the third 
supportive estimand is considered closer to a treatment policy estimand and is considered more robust 
and more relevant for the regulatory decision. The FAS is restricted to subjects who received IMP, and 
this is acceptable in a double-blinded study, provided that the extent of exclusion due to not receiving 
IMP is small. 
The primary analysis was planned to be conducted by means of a CMH test stratified for the stratification 
factors of randomization, and this is considered reasonable. The RR was planned to be estimated by the 
CMH method, and the efficacy was planned to be calculated as the RRR = 100 × (1−RR). The fact that 
initially another analysis was planned (poisson-regression) and was changed in a very late amendment 
(amendment 7, dated 05 July 2021) shortly before the data cutoff date (21 August 2021) may reflect 
uncertainty in planning and conduct of the study. 
It should be noted that the primary outcome is a composite outcome, including the components of severe 
COVID-19 and death for any cause. The study is not powered to detect effects on death and no analysis 
of death was pre-specified with multiplicity control. Deaths are investigated in an exploratory manner. 
A two-sided significance level of 0.05 and the hierarchical testing sequence are in principle acceptable. 
However, there is some uncertainty around multiplicity, as the testing approach was changed during the 
conduct of the study. Initially, an interim analysis was planned. The alpha spending for the interim 
analysis was later revised in an amendment. In another, later amendment the interim analysis was 
removed. The testing hierarchy was introduced in amendment 7. Taken together, there are currently no 
strong concerns, but some uncertainty around these changes. 
Missing response data were not imputed. This is not fully in line with the intention to treat principle. 
However, the impact of missing values and the strategy for handling missing data is considered small, in 
the updated analysis (DCO 14 January 2022) there were only 3 missing outcome values in the Evusheld 
group and 3 in the placebo group (in the FAS, 3 vs 2 in the mFAS, respectively). 
Subgroup analyses are descriptive, and this is acceptable. It seems that the expected information in 
subgroups was not prospectively discussed (except for “high risk” patients who are well represented). 
This is not necessarily problematic per se, but uncertainty in in relevant subgroups may add uncertainty 
to the overall results. 
The Study TACKLE is still running. Based on the presented data cut-off (DCO 21 August 2021), none of 
the 1014 enrolled participants has already completed the study. The median on-study follow-up time was 
84 days with the presented data cut-off. Considering the long half-life of the drug, exposure is assumed 
to be still high enough for all PD effects with this median follow-up time.  
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 84/130 
 
 
 
 
Approximately 10% of subjects were screened but not randomised, with the majority being screening 
failures. Less than 1% of the subjects were randomised but not dosed. The treatment arms are similar in 
numbers of patients who were randomized and treated. The reasons for withdrawal from study show a 
comparable picture for both treatment arms and do not raise a concern. 
In total, 6 protocol amendments became necessary. Overall, the changes seem to be well justified, but 
the need to revise the study planning (including the primary analysis model, time of analysis, multiplicity 
adjustment) indicates that the study was planned and conducted with relevant uncertainty. An additional 
guidance on “hospitalisation definition” taking into account treatment of severe disease outside the 
traditional hospital setting in temporary facilities due to limited capacities in the ongoing pandemic was 
introduced with protocol version 6 in April 2021. As “hospitalisation definition” is an integral component of 
the primary endpoint (via WHO score definition) and the further guidance was introduced late, regional or 
individual site differences in hospitalisation due to limited capacities in times of high infection rates that 
might potentially affect primary endpoint analysis cannot entirely be excluded.  
The number of important protocol deviations was quite high: 42.7% of participants had 1 or more 
important protocol deviations. The important protocol deviations were generally balanced between 
treatment groups (Evusheld: 44.2%; placebo: 41.2%). The great majority of deviations (39.1% of all 
subjects in FAS) was assigned to ‘Other Important Deviations’. The applicant states that the majority of 
these cases was related to “eDiary non-compliance” without stating on numbers. High eDiary non-
compliance is expected to result in a high number of missing values for symptom-related endpoints. As 
these were other secondary endpoints only, the impact on overall study interpretation should be minor. 
However, this high degree of non-compliance questions somewhat the appropriateness of the used 
questionnaire and/or device.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the TACKLE study, demographic and baseline characteristics, including age, race, BMI, time from 
symptom onset, risk group and smoking history were generally balanced between treatment groups. 
Furthermore, all participant disease characteristics, including COVID-19 co-morbidities, serum for SARS-
CoV-2 Serology and WHO clinical progression score were balanced between both treatment groups. The 
median time from symptom onset was 5 days. A relatively high percentage of subjects (51.8%) was of 
Hispanic or Latin ethnic origin. Most of the participants were White (61.9%) and from Europe (41.9%) or 
Latin America (42.2%). An imbalance between treatment groups was observed regarding regions: while 
14.2% of subjects were from US and 38.7% of subjects from Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico) in 
the Evusheld group, these were 8.9% and 45.7%, respectively in the placebo group. It cannot be 
excluded that regional differences in standard of care and concomitant medication might have an impact 
on patient clinical outcome and thus, such imbalances might potentially affect study results.  
Based on the baseline and demographic data presented, an adult patient population with mild-moderate 
COVID-19, without previous vaccination/infection and at risk for progression to severe COVID-19 seems 
to be adequately represented by this clinical trial. However, numbers were low for subjects without 
documented risk factors for disease progression (10.4%) and seropositives at baseline (14.1%) and thus, 
the information on potential treatment benefit for these subgroups may be limited. Upon request, 
indication was restricted to patients with risk factors for disease progression. 
For the primary analysis of the primary endpoint “Severe COVID-19 or Death From Any Cause Through 
Day 29”, data of 413 subjects in the Evusheld group and 421 subjects in the placebo group were analysed 
(DCO 21 August 2021); Approximately 9% of subjects in the Evusheld group and 7% of subjects in the 
placebo group from FAS were excluded for the applied modified full analysis set.  
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 85/130 
 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint was met: There were 18 events (4.4%) of severe COVID-19 or death from any 
cause through day 29 in patients treated with Evusheld and 37 events (8.9%) in the respective placebo 
group. This led to a 50.49% (95%: CI 14.56, 71.31) relative risk reduction for developing severe COVID-
19 or death from any cause in non-hospitalized adults who had been symptomatic for 7 days or less. As 
only few deaths occurred through day 29 (3 in the Evusheld arm and 4 in the placebo arm), the results of 
the primary composite endpoint were driven by the incidence of severe COVID-19.  
The additionally presented 1st supportive estimand including subjects with symptom onset ≤ 5 days 
indicates that earlier treatment might be beneficial. This is further supported by a subgroup analysis 
investigating RRR in subjects treated ≤3 days after symptom onset. The chosen SmPC wording 
“EVUSHELD should be given as soon as possible after a positive viral test for SARS
CoV
2 and within 7 
days of the onset of symptoms of COVID-19” is deemed appropriate. Presentation of results from the 1st 
‑
‑
supportive estimand in the SmPC is acceptable and provides prescribers with relevant information on 
benefit when treated earlier in disease course.  
The presented 2nd supportive estimand indicates a higher treatment effect after day 3 post treatment. In 
addition, the supplementary presented Kaplan-Meier plot shows that curves begin to separate at 
approximately Day 4, with no apparent treatment effect within the first 3 days after application. However, 
the applicant claims that after IM application efficacious plasma level are reached within few hours. Thus, 
this result indicates that treatment effect might not be sufficient in subjects with fast onset of clinical 
worsening and might also support the hypothesis that treatment should occur as early as possible after 
mild symptom onset. The finding is in line with what has been observed with other anti-spike mAbs (also 
after IV application) and does not raise a certain concern.  
As the primary analysis in the mFAS is not fully supported (not fully in line with the intention to treat 
principle) and a relevant number of subjects was excluded, the additionally presented 3rd supportive 
estimand investigating FAS is considered important. Here in the FAS, 6 additional events occurred in the 
Evsuheld group, whereas only 4 in the placebo group. The resulting RRR was 41.59% (95%: CI 5.01, 
64.08). The combination of 2 different reasons for exclusion from mFAS (hospitalised or symptom onset 
> 7 days) somewhat impedes interpretation of results. Additionally requested analysis in the FAS were 
not provided. The applicant states that analysis from the FAS is not in alignment with the proposed 
indication. This is not fully agreed, as there is no requirement for not being hospitalised with mild-
moderate disease at baseline in the indication wording. Thus, results of the third supportive estimands 
were additionally presented in the SmPC. 
The 4th supportive estimand demonstrates a good treatment effect in seronegatives, with RRR of 61.26% 
(95%: CI 29.67, 78.66). 
The applied event-based primary analysis resulted in overall low numbers of subjects and low numbers of 
primary endpoint events in the pivotal study TACKLE. Therefore, information from pre-defined subgroup 
analyses is limited - The study was not designed to detect treatment differences with high statistical 
power within subgroups and the explorative character of such an analysis needs to be emphasized. 
However, based on pre-defined subgroups some uncertainties arise for the therapy and the 
generalizability of a positive treatment effect remains somewhat questionable.  
In particular, in the oldest subgroups aged ≥75 years or aged ≥80 years, placebo event rate was 20% 
whereas 1/3 of Evusheld treated subjects experienced an event. In an exploratory analysis the interaction 
between age and treatment was nominally significant, suggesting decreased treatment effect with 
increasing higher age. However, events are overall sparse, and the finding would neither be supported by 
a mechanistic rationale nor by replication in independent data. There remains uncertainty, but the finding 
is currently considered likely to be a chance finding. 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 86/130 
 
 
 
 
Based on subgroup results presented, it seems like the positive treatment effect on severe COVID-19 or 
death from any cause trough day 29 is attributed to Latin American population only (Evusheld 5/166; 
placebo 24/201), whereas no treatment effect is seen in European (Evusheld 11/173; placebo 11/175) 
and US-American (Evusheld 2/62; placebo 2/36) population. The apparent lack of a positive treatment 
effect in the European population is currently not understood. Potential reasons for this finding remain 
speculative and might include differing efficacy against different emerging variants, regional differences in 
patient care/medical practice and regional differences in patient characteristics, including a higher 
proportion of elderly patients in Europe.  
In the small group of seropositives (n=113), 4 subjects experienced an event in the Evusheld group and 
1 subject in placebo group. Based on these currently available clinical data, the magnitude of treatment 
effect (if any) in the seropositive population with acute infection, cannot be derived. In routine clinical 
practice, determination of serostatus prior to treatment may not be feasible or delay treatment. As 
Evusheld has a favourable safety profile, a mAbs treatment irrespective of serostatus can be agreed.  
For certain treatments as part of standard of care, including corticosteroids, antivirals and immune-based 
therapies, a higher percentage of subjects in these subgroups experienced an event in the Evusheld 
group compared to placebo group, however, with very low numbers overall. Thus, chance findings are 
possible and the potential for an additional treatment effect in corticosteroid/anti-viral/immunotherapy 
co-treated subjects cannot be estimated based on these data. 
The key secondary endpoint analysis of “death from Any Cause or Hospitalization for COVID 19 
Complications or Sequelae through Day 169” showed results (49.11% (95% CI: 14.47, 69.72; p = 0.009) 
RRR) that are in good accordance with the primary endpoint “Severe COVID-19 or Death from Any Cause 
Through Day 29” analysed at the key secondary DCO (50.38 (95% CI: 14.38, 71.25; p = 0.010) RRR). 
As hospitalisation was a prerequisite for classification as primary endpoint event (by use of WHO scale), it 
is understood that all cases that were counted as primary events were also counted as key secondary 
events. All but one key secondary event (death due to colorectal cancer metastatic in the Evusheld 
group) occurred prior to Day 29. Therefore, the informative value regarding Evusheld’s effect on longer-
term adverse outcomes is limited. Nevertheless, results can be considered supportive. The potential 
impact of unblinding and COVID-19 vaccination on this key secondary endpoint is presumed to be low. In 
light of only one additional event observed after day 30 (after the possibility of unblinding), the censoring 
approach can be concluded to have had only minor impact. 
For the secondary endpoint “Incidence of respiratory failure through day 29”, there were 3 events (0.7%) 
of respiratory failure through day 29 in patients receiving Evusheld and 11 events (2.7%) in the 
respective placebo group. This resulted in a 71.86% (95% CI 0.25 to 92.06) relative risk reduction for 
respiratory failure through day 29. Missing response data were not imputed. The reported missing events 
were similar in both groups but high relative to number of reported events (Evusheld: 8 events and 
placebo: 9 events). Thus, a potential impact of missing values on this secondary endpoint analysis cannot 
be excluded. Overall, results on respiratory failure can be considered supportive for a treatment effect of 
Evusheld on disease progression. However, data need to be interpreted with caution as the overall 
number of events is small. 
Three (3) other secondary endpoints investigated the effect of Evusheld on COVID-19 symptom course 
compared to placebo: severity of participant-reported COVID-19 symptoms through Day 29 (16 
symptoms scored from 0 to 4); progression of participant-reported COVID-19-associated symptoms 
through Day 29; return to usual health through Day 29. Information on symptom severity/progression 
was not further collected in hospitalized subjects. In the remaining population of non-hospitalised (not 
severely ill) subjects, there was only a numerical effect on “average LS mean difference in symptom 
severity through 29 days” regarding the symptoms cough and muscle aches. For all other symptoms no 
relevant difference was observed. Furthermore, the analysis of the secondary endpoint “Time to Return to 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 87/130 
 
 
 
 
Usual Health Through Day 29” showed that the number of subjects with an event was similar in both 
treatment groups (Evusheld 271 out of 413 participants (65.6 %), Placebo: 267 out of 421 participants 
(63.4%)). Overall, no clinically relevant benefit of Evusheld compared to placebo could be derived these 
symptom related endpoints. The number of subjects with COVID-19 symptom progression (1 or more 
symptoms based on symptom severity score from 0-4) through study Day 29 was 167 (54.9%) for 
Evusheld versus 199 (62.2%) for placebo. Thus, this result might be interpreted as supportive; however, 
effect size was rather small. 
Based on secondary endpoint data available for change from baseline of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasal 
swabs through day 29, it is evident that in both, the Evusheld group and the placebo group, viral RNA 
load declined over time between day 3 and day 15. Viral decline within the first week was enhanced by 
Evusheld with moderate effect size. Clinical relevance of enhanced viral load reduction has not been fully 
established so far.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Evidence for efficacy of Evusheld has been generated by a single pivotal study investigating treatment 
effect on severe COVID-19 or death by any cause. The need to revise the study planning (including the 
primary analysis model, time of analysis, multiplicity adjustment) several times indicates that the study 
was planned and conducted with relevant uncertainty.  
Evusheld demonstrated a statistically significant effect for the primary endpoint as well as signs of 
efficacy across secondary endpoints. The primary analysis was conducted in a modified FAS, excluding 
patients hospitalised or with symptom onset ≥7 days at baseline. Therefore, the 3rd supportive estimand 
analysed in all randomized subjects (FAS) is considered closer to a treatment policy estimand, more 
robust and more relevant for the regulatory decision.  
The included patient population with mild-moderate disease was mainly young, Latin American and highly 
co-morbid. As only a patient population at risk for progression to severe COVID-19 was adequately 
represented by this clinical trial, indication was restricted upon request. Furthermore, with regard to the 
generalizability of study results some uncertainties remain for subgroups with high age, seropositivity and 
European region.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In addition to the existing safety data from 4210 participants that were enrolled in Phase 3 studies 
PROVENT and STORM CHASER, the applicant now provides clinical data from the primary analysis of the 
ongoing Phase 3 study TACKLE. The results of the Phase 1 study D8850C00001 were also submitted as 
supportive safety data. 
Evusheld (AZD7442, components: AZD8895/tixagevimab and AZD1061/cilgavimab) is a monoclonal 
antibody with a non-host target. In both Phase 3 studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER, most frequently 
reported TEAEs were headache, fatigue and cough with similar percentages regarding the different 
treatment groups after the sequential administration of 150 mg of tixagevimab and 150 mg of cilgavimab 
IM. In both Phase 3 studies, the majority of participants had TEAEs that were mild to moderate in 
intensity. Serious adverse events occurred rarely in both treatment groups. In the PROVENT study, a 
slight imbalance between the treatment arms regarding cardiac disorders (coronary and thrombo-embolic 
events) had been observed; this is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022

Adverse events that were classified as Adverse Drug Reactions were Hypersensitivity and Injection site 
reactions in line with available safety data and the mode of action. The hitherto collected safety data 
suggested a tolerable safety profile, however further (long-term) data are necessary to fully characterize 
the safety profile. 
Table below provides an overview on the submitted study safety data.

Patient exposure 
Overall extent of exposure 
The pivotal study TACKLE is an ongoing Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study is assessing the safety and efficacy of a single 600 mg dose of Evusheld IM compared 
to placebo for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients. The adult 
participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test, sample collected ≤ 3 days prior to study entry 
and with ≤7 days of symptoms of COVID-19 at study entry (‘Day 1’ symptom count starts from the first 
day of symptoms), plus the presence of select symptoms within 24 hours prior to Day 1. At least 60% of 
participants were at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. 
This application includes safety data from 452 participants with mild to moderate COVID-19 at 600 mg 
Evusheld IM; overall, 903 participants had been dosed with the IMP. As this pivotal study is ongoing, data 
from the full safety reporting are not available. The duration of the median safety follow up is 84 days 
until data cut-off (DCO) 21 August 2021; the total follow-up period is 457 days. The safety follow-up of 
the Phase 1 study, including 50 healthy participants, is completed and presents data up to day 361. The 
Safety Analysis Set consists of all participants who received at least one injection of study drug 
administration of Evusheld or placebo. 
The extent of exposure is displayed in the table below:

At the time of the Key Secondary DCO the rates increased in both groups to 174 (38.5%) and 196 
(43.5%) participants, respectively, and were still higher in the placebo group compared with the Evusheld 
group (see table below).

Table 39 Number of Participant with Adverse Events in Any Category (Safety Analysis Set)  
As for the Primary DCO, at the Key Secondary DCO the number of participants with AEs, SAEs, AEs 
leading to study withdrawal, Grade 3 or 4 AEs, and AESIs were either lower in the AZD7442 group or 
similar between the AZD7442 and placebo groups. Similarly, the number of related AEs were balanced 
between groups and there were no related SAEs reported. One additional death was reported in the 
Evusheld group; however, it was not considered related to the IMP. No Grade 3 or 4 AE was judged by 
the Investigator to be possibly related to IMP, see section below. 
In total, 40 (8.8%) participants on AZD7442 and 61 (13.5%) participants on placebo had an SAE; 7 
additional participants in each group reported SAEs since the Primary DCO. Grade 3 or 4 (severe to life-
threatening) AEs were reported in 31 (6.9%) participants on AZD7442 and 48 (10.6%) participants on 
placebo, an increase of 4 (0.9%) and 5 (1.1%), respectively, since the Primary DCO. 
Common adverse events by PT with a frequency ≥1% are displayed in the table below. Overall, the 
findings at Key Secondary DCO did not significantly differ from those at the Primary DCO.

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Severity 
In TACKLE, a Grade 3 AE was defined as a severe event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. 
The event interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the 
participant. A Grade 4 AE was defined as an event, and/or its immediate sequelae that is associated with 
an imminent risk of death (see table below).

The rate of Adverse Events with grade 3 or 4 increased minimally in both treatment groups until Key 
Secondary DCO and remained higher in the placebo group. Of note, two additional cases with cardiac 
disorders were reported in the placebo group, i.e. 3/451 (0.7%) in the placebo group and 2/452 (0.4 %) 
patients in the Evusheld group experienced Grade 3 or 4 AEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC. No additional 
severe AEs related to thrombosis or embolism were reported until Key Secondary DCO (see table below).

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events with Possible Relationship 
The proportion of participants with AEs that were possibly related to the IMP were similar 
between the total Evusheld group and the pooled placebo group (5.1% vs. 4.7%), see table below (Table 
14.3.1.4.)

At the Key Secondary DCO, Adverse events considered possibly related to IMP were and unchanged from 
the Primary DCO.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
The table below summarises all patients who experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) including fatal 
events. The analysis of SAEs, having a focus on cardiac and thrombo-embolic events, shows that the 
number of patients with SAEs was numerically lower in the Evusheld group compared with the placebo 
group. Overall, 3 patients experienced cardiac events, 1/451 (0.2%) in the placebo group, and 2/452 
(0.4%) in the Evusheld group (Acute myocardial infarction, acute myocardial infarction and acute left 
ventricular failure); 2 of these patients died (see section below), the other patient recovered. 
Thromboembolic SAEs were reported in 4 participants: 2/451 (0.4%) in the placebo group and 2 in the 
AZD7442 group (0.4%). SAEs in the Evusheld group were COVID-19 pneumonitis and Pulmonary 
embolism (recovered) and peripheral artery thrombosis (recovered). 
None of these SAEs were assessed as possibly related to IMP by the Investigator.

Until the Key Secondary DCO 7 (1.5%) participants in each group reported additional SAEs, reporting the 
following PTs (more than 1 PT may have been reported by a participant): 
•  AZD7442 group: cholecystitis chronic (2 participants), bipolar disorder, circulatory collapse 
• 
cellulitis, colorectal cancer metastatic, gastroenteritis viral, hip fracture, pneumonia bacterial, 
presyncope. 
Placebo group: arrhythmia, blood loss anaemia, cardiac failure, bacterial diarrhoea, diabetic 
retinopathy, sinusitis, foreign body in gastrointestinal tract, intravertebral disc protrusion, 
abortion spontaneous, disorientation, acute pulmonary oedema, adenomyosis. 
As mentioned above, the number of participants with Cardiac disorders SOC SAEs was 2/452 (0.4%) in 
the AZD7442 group and 3/451 (0.7%) in the placebo group, i.e. 2 additional SAEs were reported between 
both DCOs in the placebo group. All cardiac related SAEs occurred in participants with elevated 
cardiovascular risk (eg, age > 65 years, cardiac history, and hypertension) and were confounded by 
medical history. None of the Cardiac disorders SAEs were assessed as possibly related to IMP by the 
Investigator. No further thromboembolic events were reported. 
Deaths  
The table below summarizes all participants who experienced a SAE with subsequent fatal outcome during 
the TACKLE study. At the time of DCO, a total of 12/451 (1.3%) participants had died, 6/452 (1.3%) in 
the Evusheld group and 6/451 (1.3%) in the placebo group. None of the AEs leading to death were 
assessed as possibly related to IMP by the Investigator. 
There were 3 non-COVID-19 deaths in the EVUSHELD group, 1 (0.2%) due to acute left ventricular failure 
(), 1 (0.2%) due to sudden cardiac death (), and 1 (0.2%) due to progression of malignant neoplasm ().

At the time of the Key Secondary DCO, 7/452 (1.5%) participants in the AZD7442 group and 
6/451 (1.3%) participants in the placebo group had an SAE with an outcome of death, thus one death 
following metastatic colorectal cancer in the AZD7442 group was reported between the Primary and Key 
Secondary DCOs which was considered unrelated by the Investigator (see table below).

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The overall number of participants who experienced Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are listed in 
the table below. Overall, AESIs were balanced between the treatment groups.

Table 46 Number of Participants with Adverse Events of Special Interest by Category and 
Preferred Term (Safety Analysis Set), TACKLE 
At the Key Secondary DCO, the number of participants with AESIs was 15 (3.3%) in both groups, and 
unchanged from the Primary DCO.    
Adverse Drug Reactions 
Hypersensitivity, injection related, and injection site reactions were analyzed due to a possible causal 
relationship with Evusheld based on its mechanism of action. Potential risks associated risks are also 
anaphylaxis and Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). True hypersensitivity reactions were observed 
very rarely throughout the study and balanced between treatment groups. Overall, no amendment of 
SmPC section 4.8 as to the frequency of observed adverse reactions is deemed necessary.

Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
In TACKLE, hematology and coagulation parameters were to be measured at Day 1, Day 3, Day 6, Day 
15, Day 29, Day 169 and Day 366. None of the studies showed apparent differences between treatment 
groups in mean hematology or coagulation parameters over time, or in shifts from normal to high/low in 
individual parameters. In addition, there were no individual clinically important abnormalities. 
Clinical Chemistry 
In TACKLE, clinical chemistry parameters (sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, albumin, calcium, 
phosphate, glucose, and CRP) were also to be measured at Day 1, Day 3, Day 6, Day 15, Day 29, Day 
169 and Day 366. None of the studies showed apparent differences between treatment groups in mean 
clinical chemistry parameters over time, or in shifts from normal to high/low in individual parameters. 
Urinalysis 
In TACKLE, urinalysis (glucose, protein, and blood) were to be measured at Day 1, Day 6, Day 15, Day 
29, Day 169 and Day 366. None of the studies showed apparent differences between treatment groups in 
mean urinal analysis parameters over time, or in shifts from normal to high/low in individual parameters. 
No notable differences between the treatment groups in clinical chemistry, clinical hematology, 
coagulation, urinalysis or liver enzymes (ALT and AST) versus total bilirubin.  
Vital signs 
In TACKLE, Vital signs (BP, pulse rate, oral temperature, and respiratory rate) were to be measured prior 
to study start and at Day 1, Day 3, Day 6, Day 15, Day 29, Day 85, Day 169 and Day 366; furthermore, 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022

Triplicate 12-lead ECG was to be measured prior to study start and at Day 29 and Day 366. Clinically 
significant ECG abnormalities were reported for 5 participants in the EVUSHELD group and 2 participants 
in the placebo group. Of these, the ECG abnormalities were reported as AEs in one participant in the 
EVUSHELD group (at Day 29); atrioventricular block first degree and nodal rhythm. Both AEs were 
reported as mild in severity, non-serious, were assessed by the Investigator as not related to IMP and 
were not associated with any clinical symptoms or other AEs. The participant was a 38-year-old Asian 
male smoker with no prior cardiac history or concomitant medications at baseline, no other AEs on study 
and had otherwise normal QTc, QTcF and QTcB values at the time of the events. 
Vital signs (BP, pulse rate, oral temperature, and respiratory rate) were measured at different time 
points. There were no treatment-related effects on vital signs or ECGs observed following administration 
of Evusheld until the Key Secondary DCO. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
Study participants were mostly patients with a high risk of progression to severe COVID-19, i.e. 89.6% 
were defined to be as high-risk based on the following criteria:  
• Persons aged 65 years and older at randomization 
• Persons aged < 65 years and having at least one of the following conditions: obesity with BMI > 30, 
smoking, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease including history of stroke, chronic lung disease or 
moderate to severe asthma, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, 
immunocompromised state from solid organ transplant, blood or bone marrow transplant, immune 
deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immunosuppressive medicines, sickle cell disease. 
The table below provides a summary of TEAEs in this subgroup:

Table 48 Number of Participants with Adverse Events in any Category, High Risk Subgroup 
(Safety Analysis Set), TACKLE 
Extrinsic Factors 
Based on the mechanism of action, PK/PD results, and AEs presented in the tables, there is no reason to 
believe that the safety profile of Evusheld will be affected by diet, concomitant medication use or other 
extrinsic factors. 
Safety related to Drug-drug interactions 
No interaction studies have been conducted. There is a theoretical risk that Evusheld may interfere with 
COVID-19 vaccines of Evusheld. Data from animal studies reported that prior administration did not alter 
the cellular or the humoral immune responses elicited by subsequent COVID-19 vaccinations. The 
available clinical safety data did not reveal any additional safety concerns for the participants who were 
exposed to Evusheld in PROVENT and STORM CHASER and then subsequently received COVID-19 
vaccines. Based on these results, Evusheld is not anticipated to interfere with vaccine safety or efficacy.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Table below summarizes the TEAEs that lead to study discontinuation in the overall and high-risk 
subpopulation and excluding TEAEs after unblinding of the study subjects.

Table 49 Number of Participants with Adverse Events leading to Discontinuation of Study, by 
System Organ Class and Preferred Term (Safety Analysis Set) 
Few patients discontinued the study due to adverse events. Slightly more participants of the placebo 
group discontinued the study (1.6% vs. 1.1%). In the Evusheld group, all early study terminations were 
results of fatal, unrelated adverse events (see above). In the placebo group, reasons were related to 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 113/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COVID-19. Results were consistent with the high-risk group and after unblinding. The number was 
unchanged until Key Secondary DCO. 
Supportive data 
Supportive safety data come from Phase 1 study D8850C00001, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of EVUSHELD in healthy 
adults aged 18 to 55 years of age. Interim results of this study were presented in the initial marketing 
authorization. Participants were followed up until Day 361 for safety, including recording of AEs and SAEs, 
and collection of blood samples for PK and ADAs. 
Adverse events 
TEAEs were generally mild or moderate in intensity; there were no AEs of severe intensity. 26/50 
(52.0%) participants receiving Evusheld reported at least one AE. No deaths, SAEs or TEAS leading to 
treatment discontinuation were reported (see table below).

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
There are limited data from the use of Evusheld in pregnant women. In line with ICH S6, nonclinical 
reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with tixagevimab and cilgavimab. In a tissue cross-
reactivity study with tixagevimab and cilgavimab using human fetal tissues, no binding was detected. 
There are no available data on the presence of Evusheld in human milk or animal milk, the effects on the 
breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. There are no data on the effects of 
tixagevimab and cilgavimab on human fertility. 
Up to the January 2022 DCO, 3 pregnancies were reported during the study, 2 for placebo and one for 
AZD7442. The outcome of 2 of the pregnancies was unknown at the time of this report, one pregnancy in 
a women assigned to the placebo group ended in a miscarriage 154 days after administration of the study 
drug.  
Overdose 
Evusheld is administered IM as single dose by medical professionals, therefore the risk of overdosing is 
deemed low. In the Phase I clinical trials, doses up to 3000 mg intravenously (1500 mg each of 
tixagevimab and cilgavimab) have been administered without dose-limiting toxicity. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
Due to the single dose nature of Evusheld, there is no risk of withdrawal. To date, there are no data to 
support the occurrence of ADE of infection following administration. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental 
Ability 
No studies on the effects of Evusheld on the ability to drive or use machines have been performed; 
however, based on the AE profile observed, Evusheld appears to have no or negligible influence on the 
ability to drive or use machines.

Post marketing experience 
Cumulatively, until 28◦February◦2022, 100 case reports (33 serious and 67 non-serious) with 258 events 
have been received. The sources include serious and non-serious reports from spontaneous sources and 
serious adverse reactions from non-interventional post-authorization/marketing studies. 
Of the 100 reports, 98 reports were received from United States, 1 from France and 1 from Germany. 
The most commonly reported SOCs were general disorders and administration site conditions (62), 
Nervous system disorders (36), Gastrointestinal disorders (20), Investigations (19), and Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders (19).  
Most commonly reported PTs were Headache (18), Fatigue (16), Chills (11), COVID-19 (11) and Pyrexia 
(6). There have been 3 reports of cases with fatal outcome. The first case was headache, second case 
sudden death and third case brain death and subarachnoid haemorrhage. All events were confounded by 
patients’ medical history and provided limited information precluding appropriate medical assessment. 
Serious hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis is a potential risk and included under Section 4.4 
(Warnings and Precautions) of Evusheld Core Data Sheet (CDS). Cumulatively, 5 reports with 9 events of 
serious hypersensitivity have been received. The events are being closely monitored as part of ongoing 
surveillance.  
Cardiac and thromboembolic events are considered a potential risk for EVUSHELD and are closely 
monitored as a part of ongoing safety surveillance. Cumulatively, 7 serious reports with 8 events have 
been received from spontaneous sources and early access program. The reports included PTs, each, of 
Acute myocardial infarction, Cardiac arrest, Cardiac disorder, Palpitations, Haemorrhagic stroke, Transient 
ischaemic attack, Pulmonary embolism and Deep vein thrombosis. In all of these cases, the patients had 
one or several relevant risk factors (such as age, obesity, hypertension, malignancies), relevant medical 
history (such as transient ischaemic attack, atrial fibrillation etc), were confounded by concomitant 
medications, or had limited information:  
•  A spontaneous report of cardiac arrest (PT: cardiac arrest) was received from a health care 
professional in the regarding a >60-year-old subject with medical history included atrial 
fibrillation, hypertension, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, pneumoconiosis and lung transplant. 
Thirteen days after EVUSHELD administration, the patient was in normal sinus rhythm and 
hemodynamically stable and had a cardiac arrest later that day.  
•  A spontaneous report of an acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (PT: acute 
myocardial infarction) was received from a health care professional in the regarding a 60 to 70-
year-old subject with medical history of hypertension, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and obesity. One 
day after EVUSHELD administration, the patient experienced an acute anterior ST-elevation 
myocardial infarction (PT: acute myocardial infarction). The outcome was reported as resolved. 
•  A report of massive haemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (PT: haemorrhagic stroke) was 
received from a health care professional regarding an > 80 -year-old subject enrolled in early 
access program  with medical history of pulmonary embolism, hypertension, congenital mitral 
valve incompetence, hypogammaglobulinemia, aortic rupture, pneumococcal sepsis. Co-suspect 
medications included apixaban and immunoglobulins. Nineteen days after EVUSHELD 
administration and 4 days after the patient was hospitalized for monthly infusion of 
immunoglobulins, the patient died following massive haemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident. 
•  A report of deep vein thrombosis (PT: deep vein thrombosis) and pulmonary embolism (PT: 
pulmonary embolism) was received from a health care professional regarding a 70 to 80 -year-old 
subject enrolled in early access program in with medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,

breast cancer, radiotherapy, endometrial cancer, autoimmune thyroiditis, haemolytic anaemia. 
Three days after EVUSHELD administration, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolism. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered. 
•  A report of transient ischemic attack (PT: transient ischaemic attack) was received from a health 
care professional regarding an > 80 -year-old subject enrolled in early access program in with 
medical history of breast cancer, renal transplant, transient ischaemic attack, substance use, 
hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One day after 
the EVUSHELD administration, the patient experienced transient ischemic attack and was 
reported to have recovered on the same day. 
•  A report of septal hyperpnoea (PT: cardiac disorder) was received from a health care professional 
regarding a 70 to 80 -year-old subject enrolled in the early access program in with a medical 
history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, nephropathy and hypercholesterolaemia. The 
patient was reported to have a fall, pulmonary oedema and septal hyperpnoea one day after 
receiving EVUSHELD. 
•  A consumer report of (PT: palpitations) was received from a 40 to 50 -year-old subject. Five 
minutes after EVUSHELD administration, the patient had an allergic reaction and reported that 
her “heart was racing” (PT: palpitations), “had chest pain in waves” (PT: chest pain), probably 
had ischemia (preferred term: ischaemia). The patient also reported nausea. She was treated 
with famotidine and diphenhydramine intravenously and was observed in the emergency room for 
a couple of hours. The patient recovered from the events after approximately 30 minutes. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The applicant initially provided clinical safety data from the primary analysis of the ongoing Phase 3 study 
TACKLE with a data cut-off (DCO) of 21 August 2021 together with the results of the Phase 1 study 
D8850C00001 as supportive safety data. With the responses to the first List of Questions, the applicant 
provided updated safety data analyses based on the Key Secondary Data Cut-Off of 14 January 2022.  
The safety follow-up is currently still ongoing. 
Beside the hitherto collected post-marketing data, the safety database comprises clinical data from 4210 
participants that were enrolled in Phase 3 studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER (prophylaxis setting). In 
both Phase 3 studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER, most frequently reported TEAEs were headache, 
fatigue and cough with similar percentages regarding the different treatment groups after the sequential 
administration of 150 mg of tixagevimab and 150 mg of cilgavimab IM. In both Phase 3 studies, the 
majority of participants had TEAEs that were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events 
occurred rarely in both treatment groups. In the PROVENT study, a slight imbalance between the 
treatment arms regarding cardiac disorders (coronary and thrombo-embolic events) had been observed; 
this is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Adverse events that were classified as Adverse Drug 
Reactions were Hypersensitivity and Injection site reactions in line with available safety data and the 
mode of action. The hitherto collected safety data suggested a tolerable safety profile, however further 
(long-term) data are necessary to fully characterize the safety profile. 
In TACKLE, 903 patients were randomized 1:1 to one of both treatment arms and received 300 mg 
tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab or matching placebo as subsequent IM injections. The safety follow-
up is currently limited to 170 days, the overall follow-up is planned for 457 days. Thus, final results are 
expected after the read out of the completed safety follow-up. The 58 patients enrolled in the First-in-
human study D8850C00001 completed the safety follow-up of 361 days.

Overall, the demographic and patient characteristics were fairly balanced between the treatment groups, 
however, elderly participants ≥65 years are considered underrepresented with 12.8% compared with the 
age structure of the European (20%≥65 years) and US population (16%≥65 years). Elderly >65 years 
are at higher risk for more serious COVID-19 due to immunosenescence. The majority were considered 
high-risk participants with ≥1 co-morbidity at baseline, had negative serum serology for SARS-CoV-2, 
were White and resided in Europe or Latin America. COVID-Symptoms were present for 5 days (mean) 
and classified as ambulatory mild disease based on WHO Clinical Progression Scale. Uses of this scale has 
challenges as regards quantification of subjective symptoms, the variability in the use of life support 
measures based on co-morbidities and different therapeutic approaches etc., however, as it focuses on 
variables relevant to most subjects in COVID trials it is considered useful to identify and follow-up a study 
population within these trials. Most common risk factors were obesity, hypertension, diabetes, chronic 
lung disease/asthma, and these were balanced across the treatment arms. The chosen risk factor are 
considered relevant to define a high-risk population in need for rapid treatment. The overall study 
population is relatively similar to the PROVENT population as regards the percentage distribution of the 
diverse risk factors. However, in TACKLE the population was younger (mean 46 vs. 57 years), and more 
patients were classified to be at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (89.6% vs. 77.5%).  
The proportion of patients who experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse 
events (SAEs) and TEAEs leading to early study termination was smaller in the Evusheld group compared 
with the placebo group. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and TEAEs with fatal outcome were 
balanced between both treatment groups. Slightly more treatment related TEAEs were observed in the 
Evusheld group. No treatment-related SAE was reported, and related AESI were also balanced.  
TEAEs that occurred more frequently in the placebo group were COVID-19 pneumonia and COVID-19. In 
the Evusheld group, Diabetes mellitus, Insomnia and Dizziness were more frequently reported, however, 
differences were modest between both treatment groups. Grade 3/4 TEAEs were rare, more often 
reported in the placebo group and no specific pattern is apparent. A subgroup analysis of TEAEs was 
requested for the non-high risk group; within this population the Evusheld group reported AEs less 
frequently and thus, seemed to have a more favorable safety profile, however, patients numbers are 
limited. 
Pyrexia was reported in 2 subjects in Evusheld group and none in placebo (0.2% vs 0%) and both cases 
were considered related by the investigator. The applicant provided information of time-to-onset relative 
to Evusheld administration and time to resolution. Following the assessment of the supplementary data, 
PT ‘pyrexia’ as ADR for Evusheld is not supported. The same applies for PTs ‘fatigue’ and ‘cough’. 
Serious Adverse events occurred more frequently in the placebo group. Due to an observed small 
imbalance of cardiac SAEs in the PROVENT study, special focus laid on the analysis of cardiac disorders. 
The applicant clarified that at the time of Key Secondary DCO of 14 January 2022, the number of 
participants with Cardiac disorders SAEs was 2/452 (0.4%) in the EVUSHELD and 3/451 (0.7%) in the 
placebo arm; 2 of these in the placebo group were reported between the Primary and Key Secondary 
DCOs. Thus, no imbalance is currently present that would necessitate amendments of the PI. 
Thromboembolic SAEs were reported in 4 participants: 2 in the Evusheld group (Pulmonary embolism and 
peripheral artery thrombosis), and 2 in the placebo group (Portal vein thrombosis and superior sagittal 
sinus thrombosis). The applicant provided additional information on all thromboembolic events (including 
non-serious AEs) occurring in TACKLE study. Recent data suggest that these events were related to 
confounding factors resulting from comorbidities. There is no nonclinical evidence by which Evusheld 
would impact the risk of cardiovascular or thromboembolic events. Non-clinical and clinical data do not 
allow at this point to draw a strong conclusion regarding the association between Evusheld and 
thromboembolic events.

Deaths due to serious adverse events were rare and numerically balanced between the treatment groups. 
Reasons for death in the Evusheld group were acute left ventricular failure, sudden cardiac death, and 
progression of gastric cancer, COVID-19 pneumonia, and respiratory distress due to COVID-19. At Key 
secondary DCO, one additional death had occurred in the Evusheld group following metastatic colorectal 
cancer. None of these serious adverse events was considered related to the study drug by the 
investigators; this assessment can be accepted regarding the narratives. 
AESI were very rarely observed throughout this study until the Key Secondary DCO. Individual cases of 
injection site reactions were reported with similar frequencies across both treatment arms. Antibody-
dependent enhancement of disease is a concern to disease control which has been reported in vitro and in 
vivo for different viruses with distinct features such as preferential replication in macrophages, ability to 
establish persistence, and antigenic diversity (Dengue, Zika, SARS-CoV-1). However, based on current 
knowledge, a potential pathological relevance of ADE during SARS-CoV-2 infection seems unlikely (Arvin 
et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2021). In synopsis with the available safety data that suggest that no clinical 
evidence for ADE in association with Evusheld administration is present, it is acknowledged that the 
specific investigation of ADE was not performed. 
The results of the clinical laboratory and vital signs evaluations presented in the CRS suggest that no 
clinically relevant changes in laboratory findings were observed throughout the clinical study until the Key 
secondary DCO, neither in the overall nor in the high-risk study population.  
The safety results of the high-risk group are consistent with the overall study population, which is 
plausible as 89.6% of the participants are included in this ‘subgroup’. In Phase 1 study D8850C00001, 
more TEAEs were reported in the placebo group (80% vs. 52%). Overall, there were no clinically 
meaningful imbalances in AEs across treatment groups and TEAEs that were possibly related to the study 
drug. Taking into account the lack of SAEs, deaths or premature study discontinuation, it seems that 
Evusheld was well tolerated in healthy adults. No specific safety concerns arise from this treatment 
setting.  
The applicant was asked to discuss the inclusion of PT ‘Dizziness’ and ‘Pyrexia’ in section 4.8, however, as 
discussed by the applicant, a causal association between both TEAEs and Evusheld has not been 
established which is agreed. Based on the provided safety data, no further amendment of SmPC section 
4.8 is deemed necessary. 
Overall, few patients discontinued the study due to adverse events. Slightly more participants of the 
placebo group discontinued the study (1.6% vs. 1.1%). In the Evusheld group, all early study 
terminations were results of fatal, unrelated adverse events (see above). In the placebo group, reasons 
were related to COVID-19. Results were consistent with the high-risk group and after unblinding.  
No data on drug-drug interaction is available from the TACKLE study and no interaction studies had been 
conducted in the PROVENT or STORM CHASER studies. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
Data on pregnant women were provided upon request. Individual cases were reported with unknown 
outcome apart from one case. This information is considered of no consequence for the PI. 
The safety results of the TACKLE study are consistent with those of PROVENT and STORM CHASER 
Evusheld seems to be well-tolerated if administered for the treatment of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized 
patients. This is in line with the benign safety profile for other monoclonal antibodies directed against 
external targets.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of Evusheld 600 mg IM for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 seems 
consistent with that reported in participants who had received 300 mg EVUSHELD for COVID-19 
prophylaxis. All ‘other concerns’ related to the characterization of the study population and the safety 
profile were solved.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1,4.2,4.4, 4.8,4.9,5.1,5.2,6.3, 6.6 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make some editorial changes. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Evusheld (tixagevimab, cilgavimab) is included 
in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet include a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
2.7.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
The review of the QR code request submitted by the MAH is presented in a separate attachment to this

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The symptoms of COVID-19, if present, differ with severity of disease. The symptoms most frequently 
associated with symptomatic mild to moderate illness include fever, cough, fatigue, muscle or body 
aches, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, and a loss in sense of taste or smell. COVID-19 is a systemic disease affecting not 
just the respiratory tract but also in myocardial, renal, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and pharyngeal 
tissues and where hACE2 receptors have been identified (Gupta et al 2020). Patients may progress to 
severe pneumonia or develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is the primary cause for 
respiratory failure, and direct organ damage by the virus likely contributes to multiorgan failure. Some 
people who recover from COVID-19 go on to suffer from symptoms long-term. Mortality risk factors 
associated with COVID 19 include age > 60 years (significantly greater for those 80 years and older), 
male sex, and chronic medical conditions including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular 
disease (Zhou et al 2020a). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
As transmission continues and different variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of severe disease and 
hospitalization, and in some countries, mortality, remain high. Breakthrough infections of fully vaccinated 
individuals continue to emerge both in the general population (Hacisuleyman et al 2021) and in high risk 
populations (Agha et al 2021, ACIP 2021). The latest variant of concern, the highly mutated Omicron 
variant and its lineages, has increased transmissibility versus the original and Delta strains (Garcia-
Beltran et al 2022), with BA.4/5 fast becoming the dominant strain worldwide (WHO 2022b). Early data 
suggests that vaccine effectiveness is reduced against Omicron B.1.1.529 (Dejnirattisai et al 2021; 
Regev-Yochay et al 2022) and therefore is likely leading to breakthrough disease in a COVID-19 
vaccinated/recovered population as well as in those who remain unvaccinated or unresponsive to 
vaccines. Despite the reduced severity seen with Omicron infections (Lauring et al 2022), certain 
individuals remain an increased risk of severe disease and includes, but is not limited to, the elderly, 
cancer patients as well as those with ongoing chronic health conditions. Globally, there is still a critical 
need to reduce hospitalizations and reduce the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare systems. Therefore, 
preventing progression of mild to moderate COVID-19 to severe disease remains a significant clinical 
need. 
Clinical management of COVID-19 is based on supportive care and there are limited approved/authorized 
effective treatment interventions, which include antivirals as well as mAbs (eg, in some markets: 
remdesivir [VELKURY], PF07321332/ritonavir [PAXLOVID], regdanvimab [REGKIRONA], casirivimab and 
imdevimab [RONAPREVE], and sotrovimab [XEVUDY]), which results in healthcare resources being 
stretched (Tangcharoensathien et al 2021). Recent in vitro antiviral resistance studies have demonstrated 
that some mAbs in late clinical development, do not offer significant neutralization of the emergent SARS-
CoV-2 Omicron subvariants and as a consequence are no longer available in some markets. Evusheld 
remains one of the only mAb products to retain neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant authentic 
virus in vitro, with comparable activity against Omicron BA.2 to the original strain (Case et al 2022) and 
also some residual activity against BA.4/5 although this seems to be more limited (Takashita et al 2022).  
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 123/130 
 
 
 
 
As the pandemic continues, and new variants emerge, there is a need for additional effective therapeutic 
antibodies that target different epitopes on the spike protein, and for people ineligible for antivirals, to 
prevent COVID-19 disease progression and its serious complications (Kim et al 2020). 
Clinical benefit is likely to be achieved by treating patients early in their disease course while the disease 
is primarily driven by replication of SARS-CoV-2, before the innate immune/inflammatory response is 
triggered, and the disease progresses to severe illness requiring hospitalization. However, treatments 
available specifically in the outpatient setting are limited.  Overall, despite effective vaccination programs, 
COVID-19 remains a global threat with significant numbers of patients contracting the disease. Early 
intervention is critical to prevent progression to severe disease, especially for those who are at high risk 
of severe COVID-19. There are limited treatment options available and, as variants emerge, there is a 
risk that treatments that are currently effective may not remain so, therefore further options that are 
effective against current variants are needed, including those available in the outpatient setting. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical study 
Study D8851C00001 (TACKLE), an ongoing Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, AstraZeneca-sponsored study in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 provides 
key data supporting the efficacy and safety of Evusheld in this application. Approximately 90% of 
participants met the protocol definition of being at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. 
This Application includes the final CSR for the AstraZeneca-sponsored Phase I FTIH study (Study 
D8850C00001). An overview of these studies is provided in the table below. 
Table 52 Studies with Evusheld included in the application. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The percentage of subjects who experienced severe COVID-19 (defined as selected symptoms of 
pneumonia or signs of hypoxia plus score ≥5 on WHO COVID-19 progression scale) or death from any 
cause was reduced by Evusheld compared to placebo in the pivotal study TACKLE (primary endpoint): 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 124/130 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Treatment with Evusheld compared with placebo led to a 50.49% (95% CI: 14.56 to 71.31) RRR 
for developing severe COVID-19 or death from any cause in non-hospitalized adults who had 
been symptomatic for 7 days or less (modified FAS). 
The study achieved statistically significant results in 4 supportive estimands: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment with Evusheld compared with placebo led to a 66.93% (95% CI: 31.11, 84.12) RRR for 
developing severe COVID-19 or death from any cause through Day 29 in non-hospitalized 
participants dosed ≤ 5 days from symptom onset (first supportive estimand). 
Treatment with Evusheld compared with placebo led to a 62.98% (95% CI: 29.45, 80.57) RRR for 
developing severe COVID-19 or death from any cause from Day 4 through Day 29 in non-
hospitalized participants dosed ≤ 7 days from symptom onset (second supportive estimand). 
Treatment with Evusheld compared with placebo led to a 41.59% (95% CI: 5.01, 64.08) RRR for 
developing severe COVID-19 or death from any cause from through Day 29 in all randomized 
participants (third supportive estimand). 
Treatment with Evusheld compared with placebo led to a 61.26% (95% CI: 29.67, 78.66) RRR for 
developing severe COVID-19 or death from any cause from through Day 29 in non-hospitalized 
participants, who are seronegative at baseline, dosed ≤ 7 days from symptom onset (fourth 
supportive estimand). 
The percentage of subjects who experienced death from any cause or hospitalization for COVID-19 
complications or sequelae during the 168-day post-dose period (Day 1 to Day 169) was reduced by 
Evusheld compared to placebo in the pivotal study TACKLE (key secondary endpoint): 
• 
Treatment with Evusheld compared with placebo led to a 49.11% (95% CI: 14.47, 69.72) RRR for 
the composite endpoint of either death or hospitalization for COVID-19 complications or sequelae 
through Day 169. 
Evusheld treatment demonstrated a favourable effect on the secondary endpoint “Incidence of respiratory 
failure (defined as requirement for mechanical ventilation, ECMO, non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow 
nasal cannula oxygen delivery) through day 29”: 
• 
Treatment with Evusheld compared with placebo resulted in a 71.86% (95% CI 0.25 to 92.06) 
relative risk reduction for respiratory failure through day 29. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Various design changes were conducted in the ongoing study. Some of the subjects were unblinded in the 
ongoing study and prior to key secondary endpoint analysis. 
No adolescents, pregnant or breast-feeding women were included. Limited data on elderly is available. 
The number of events was overall small. Furthermore, available data do not suffice to establish efficacy in 
several sub-populations.  
The additional information for longer follow-up gained from the key secondary endpoint is considered 
small, as only one additional event was observed after the observation period for the primary endpoint. 
A tendency for a negative effect of Evusheld was seen in relevant subgroups including subjects at highest 
age (above 75 years), seropositives, in patients infected with the alpha variant and subjects from 
European region. 
No data are available on efficacy in previously vaccinated subjects. Furthermore, for these half-life 
extended antibodies there is a theoretical risk for PD interaction of Evusheld with subsequent COVID-19 
vaccination (impaired cellular or humoral immune response) that has not been addressed in clinical trials.  
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 125/130 
 
 
 
 
Viral sequencing data from clinical trials are too limited to allow conclusion on clinical efficacy in 
treatment against certain VOC/VOI. No clinical data on latest variants of concern (including omicron sub-
variants) are available.  
Unfavourable effects 
In the placebo arm, 6 (1.3%) patients and in the Evusheld arm, 7 (1.5%) patients died during the study 
as a result of serious adverse events. Reasons for death in the Evusheld group were acute left ventricular 
failure (1, 0.2%), sudden cardiac death (1, 0.2%), progression of gastric cancer (1, 0.2%), COVID-19 
pneumonia (2, 0.4%), respiratory distress due to COVID-19 (1, 0.2%), and metastatic colorectal cancer 
(1, 0.2%). In the placebo group, 3 (0.7%) participants died due to COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory 
failure, and 2 due to COVID-19 and septic shock, one cause was unknown. 
Antibody-dependent disease enhancement was not investigated in the pivotal study. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The proportion of patients that experienced any common treatment-emergent adverse event or any 
serious adverse event was higher in the placebo arm compared with the Evusheld arm. These differences 
remained until the Key Secondary DCO. 
Adverse events of special interest were numerically balanced between the treatment groups.  
SAEs were observed with a higher frequency in the placebo group. No treatment-related SAE was 
reported.  
Severe TEAEs were rare, more often reported in the placebo group and no specific adverse events pattern 
is apparent. None of SAEs with a fatal outcome were considered related to the study drug. 
The safety follow-up is currently restricted to 170 days, the overall follow-up is planned for 457 days. 
The available data (in vitro, non-clinical, clinical) do not raise a concern regarding antibody-dependent 
disease enhancement for the time being. Available clinical data on anti-drug antibody formation after 
Evusheld administration is currently limited. 
No clinical data is available for adolescents, and very limited data concerning pregnant, breastfeeding and 
elderly patients.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study TACKLE, a composite of either severe COVID-19 or death from 
any cause through study Day 29, is a relevant measure of overall clinical status in patients with mild to 
moderate COVID-19 at baseline. Evusheld demonstrated a statistically significant effect with moderate 
effect size for this important endpoint. The supportive analyses confirmed the significance of the results 
related to the primary endpoint.  
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 127/130 
 
 
 
 
With regard to the generalizability of study results some uncertainties remain for the pre-specified 
subgroups with high-age (above 75 years), seropositivity and European region. 
The results of the key secondary endpoint, as a measure of clinical worsening, can be considered 
supportive. There were signs of efficacy across secondary endpoints investigating development of COVID-
19 symptoms. However, considering the magnitude of effect, observations on COVID-19 symptoms are 
considered of limited clinical relevance. 
Efficacy data until day 29 are considered most relevant for the treatment of mild-moderate COVID-19.  
Potential bias resulting from inadequate planning and partial unblinding did not have the potential to 
impact study results to an extent that would make the entire conclusion on efficacy questionable. 
Lacking efficacy data in adolescents ≥40 kg may be compensated by popPK modelling. Based on 
theoretical considerations, adolescents are expected to profit from treatment in a similar way like adult 
patients. Currently available data and theoretical considerations did not identify specific safety issues. 
Treatment of pregnant women was currently not investigated in the clinical trial setting. Lack of cross-
reactivity in human foetal tissues suggests low risk to developing foetuses in pregnant women 
administered Evusheld. Nevertheless, currently available information without any clinical data is too 
limited to make a general treatment recommendation. Use in pregnancy is subject to Additional 
Pharmacovigilance Activities. Based on biological plausibility no risk for the breastfed infant is anticipated. 
Treatment in breast feeding women may be considered when clinically indicated. 
There is a theoretical risk for PD interaction of Evusheld with COVID-19 vaccines (impaired cellular or 
humoral immune response) that has not been addressed in clinical trials. As clinical trial data for 
subsequently SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals are lacking, treatment decisions or timing of such 
decisions will need to be based on local/national guidelines.  
As no clinical efficacy data will be obtained for recent/upcoming viral variants, estimates on efficacy will 
need to rely on in vitro information and modelling/simulations. Information from clinical trials on efficacy 
against certain VOCs is limited. The risk of viral resistance will be adequately addressed post approval by 
“other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities for lack of efficacy”. Post-authorisation reviews of 
genomic databases such as GISAID for emerging Variants of Interest and Variants of Concern and 
subsequent phenotypic evaluation by use of in vitro assays are planned. 
The submitted and currently available safety data resulting from the pivotal TACKLE study suggest a good 
tolerability and low immunogenic potential of Evusheld in the investigated adult (high-risk) population as 
the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events or adverse events leading to 
early study discontinuation was overall lower in the Evusheld group compared with the placebo group. 
Furthermore, no specific adverse event cluster was observed in the Evusheld group that would qualify for 
the determination of additional adverse drug reactions. Effects in patients with assumed 
immunosenescence (>65 years) and those classified as not being at high risk for developing severe 
COVID-19 are considered underrepresented, limiting the informative value of the data in these patients. 
The unfavourable effects seen in the TACKLE study population are similar to those of the PROVENT study 
keeping in mind, that the TACKLE population was overall younger and less prone to severe disease 
courses. 
Deaths due to serious adverse events were rare, almost numerically balanced between the treatment 
groups and all considered unrelated to the study drug; this assessment is concurred for the time being. In 
contrast to the observations in the PROVENT study, serious cardiac adverse events were slightly more 
frequently observed in the placebo group of the TACKLE study, thus, no cardiac adverse effects of 
Evusheld are currently assumed based on the available safety data. No new thromboembolic events were 
Assessment report  
EMA/834036/2022 
Page 128/130 
 
 
 
 
reported until the Key Secondary DCO; non-clinical and clinical data do not allow at this point to draw a 
strong conclusion regarding the association between Evusheld and thromboembolic events.  
The hitherto known safety profile should be further characterised. Currently safety data in adolescents are 
lacking and sparse in pregnant/breastfeeding women and elderly. Long-term safety data are limited to 
170 days and are expected to be updated after completion of the follow-up phase. Cardiac and 
thromboembolic events are continuously monitored. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The effect of Evusheld on overall clinical status in mild to moderately ill COVID-19 patients at increased 
risk for progression to severe disease was considered to be clinically relevant. A single dose 
administration of Evusheld demonstrated a good safety profile with a manageable risk of 
hypersensitivity/application-related reactions that does not raise a specific concern. As all the requested 
changes were implemented in the SmPC; the benefit-risk balance is considered positive. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None  
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Evusheld is positive. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to pharmacology: 
•  Bioanalytical reports for the determination of AZD8895 and AZD1061 human serum 
concentrations in TACKLE are currently outstanding and should be provided as soon as available 
(Q4, 2022) (REC). 
• 
Final TACKLE CSR should be provided as soon as available. (REC).

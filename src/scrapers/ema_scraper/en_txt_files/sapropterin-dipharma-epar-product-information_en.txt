CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Sapropterin Dipharma is indicated for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in adults and 
paediatric patients of all ages with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have been shown to be responsive to 
such treatment (see section 4.2). 
Sapropterin Dipharma is also indicated for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in adults 
and paediatric patients of all ages with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency who have been shown to 
be responsive to such treatment (see section 4.2). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride must be initiated and supervised by a physician 
experienced in the treatment of PKU and BH4 deficiency. 
Active management of dietary phenylalanine and overall protein intake while taking this medicinal 
product is required to ensure adequate control of blood phenylalanine levels and nutritional balance. 
As HPA due to either PKU or BH4 deficiency is a chronic condition, once responsiveness is 
demonstrated, Sapropterin Dipharma is intended for long-term use (see section 5.1). 
Posology 
PKU 
The starting dose of sapropterin dihydrochloride in adult and paediatric patients with PKU is 10 mg/kg 
body weight once daily. The dose is adjusted, usually between 5 and 20 mg/kg/day, to achieve and 
maintain adequate blood phenylalanine levels as defined by the physician. 
BH4 deficiency 
The starting dose of sapropterin dihydrochloride in adult and paediatric patients with BH4 deficiency 
is 2 to 5 mg/kg body weight total daily dose. Doses may be adjusted up to a total of 20 mg/kg per day.

Sapropterin Dipharma is provided as 100 mg tablets. The calculated daily dose based on body weight 
should be rounded to the nearest multiple of 100. For instance, a calculated dose of 401 to 450 mg 
should be rounded down to 400 mg corresponding to 4 tablets. A calculated dose of 451 mg to 499 mg 
should be rounded up to 500 mg corresponding to 5 tablets. 
Dose adjustment 
Treatment with sapropterin may decrease blood phenylalanine levels below the desired therapeutic 
level. Adjustment of the sapropterin dihydrochloride dose or modification of dietary phenylalanine 
intake may be required to achieve and maintain blood phenylalanine levels within the desired 
therapeutic range. 
Blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels should be tested, particularly in the paediatric population, one 
to two weeks after each dose adjustment and monitored frequently thereafter, under the direction of 
the treating physician. 
If inadequate control of blood phenylalanine levels is observed during treatment with sapropterin 
dihydrochloride, the patient’s adherence to the prescribed treatment, and diet, should be reviewed 
before considering an adjustment of the dose of sapropterin. 
Discontinuation of treatment should be done only under the supervision of a physician. More frequent 
monitoring may be required, as blood phenylalanine levels may increase. Dietary modification may be 
necessary to maintain blood phenylalanine levels within the desired therapeutic range. 
Determination of response 
It is of primary importance to initiate treatment as early as possible to avoid the appearance of non-
reversible clinical manifestations of neurological disorders in paediatric patients and cognitive deficits 
and psychiatric disorders in adults due to sustained elevations of blood phenylalanine. 
Response to this medicinal product is determined by a decrease in blood phenylalanine. Blood 
phenylalanine levels should be checked before administering sapropterin dihydrochloride and after 1 
week of use at the recommended starting dose. If an unsatisfactory reduction in blood phenylalanine 
levels is observed, then the dose can be increased weekly to a maximum of 20 mg/kg/day, with 
continued weekly monitoring of blood phenylalanine levels over a one month period. The dietary 
phenylalanine intake should be maintained at a constant level during this period. 
A satisfactory response is defined as a ≥ 30 percent reduction in blood phenylalanine levels or 
attainment of the therapeutic blood phenylalanine goals defined for an individual patient by the 
treating physician. Patients who fail to achieve this level of response within the described one month 
test period should be considered non-responsive, these patients should not be treated with sapropterin 
dihydrochloride and administration of sapropterin dihydrochloride should be discontinued. 
Once responsiveness to the medicinal product has been established, the dose may be adjusted within 
the range of 5 to 20 mg/kg/day according to response to therapy. 
It is recommended that blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels be tested one or two weeks after each 
dose adjustment and monitored frequently thereafter under the direction of the treating physician. 
Patients treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride must continue a restricted phenylalanine diet and 
undergo regular clinical assessment (such as monitoring of blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, 
nutrient intake, and psycho- motor development). 
Special populations  
Elderly 
Safety and efficacy of sapropterin dihydrochloride in patients above 65 years of age have not been 
established. Caution must be exercised when prescribing to elderly patients. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety and efficacy of sapropterin dihydrochloride in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency have 
not been established. Caution must be exercised when prescribing to such patients. 
Paediatric population 
The posology is the same in adults, children, and adolescents. 
Method of administration 
Oral use, after dissolution. 
Sapropterin Dipharma tablets should be administered with a meal to increase the absorption. 
For patients with PKU, Sapropterin Dipharma should be administered as a single daily dose, and at the 
same time each day preferably in the morning. 
For patients with BH4 deficiency, divide the total daily dose into 2 or 3 administrations, distributed 
over the day. 
The prescribed number of tablets should be placed in a glass or cup of water and stirred until 
dissolved. It may take a few minutes for the tablets to dissolve. To make the tablets dissolve faster 
they can be crushed. Small particles may be visible in the solution and will not affect the effectiveness 
of the medicinal product. The solution should be drunk within 15 to 20 minutes. 
Patients above 20 kg body weight 
The prescribed number of tablets should be placed in a glass or cup with 120 to 240 ml of water and 
stirred until dissolved. 
Children up to 20 kg body weight 
The measuring devices required for dosing in children up to 20 kg body weight (i.e. cup with 
graduations at 20, 40, 60, 80 ml; 10 ml and 20 ml oral syringes with graduation at 1 ml divisions) are 
not included in the Sapropterin Dipharma pack. These devices are supplied to the specialised 
paediatric centres for inborn errors of metabolism to be provided to the caregivers of the patients. 
Depending on the dose (in mg/kg/day) the appropriate number of tablets should be dissolved in a 
volume of water as depicted in Tables 1-4, whereby the volume of the solution to be administered is 
calculated according to the prescribed total daily dose. The prescribed number of tablets for a 2, 5, 10 
and 20 mg/kg/day dose should be placed in a cup (that shows the appropriate graduation markings at 
20, 40, 60 and 80 ml) with the amount of water as depicted in Tables 1-4 and stirred until dissolved. 
If only a portion of this solution needs to be administered, an oral syringe should be used to withdraw 
the volume of solution to be administered. The solution may then be transferred to another cup for 
administration of the medicinal product. For small infants an oral syringe can be used. A 10 ml oral 
syringe should be used for administration of volumes of  10 ml and a 20 ml oral syringe for 
administration of volumes of > 10 ml.

For cleaning, the plunger should be removed from the barrel of the oral syringe. Both parts of the oral 
syringe and the cup should be washed with warm water and air dry. When the oral syringe is dry, the 
plunger should be put back into the barrel. The oral syringe and the cup should be stored for next use. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Dietary intake 
Patients treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride must continue a restricted phenylalanine diet and 
undergo regular clinical assessment (such as monitoring of blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, 
nutrient intake, and psycho- motor development). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Low blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels 
Sustained or recurrent dysfunction in the phenylalanine-tyrosine-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (DOPA) 
metabolic pathway can result in deficient body protein and neurotransmitter synthesis. Prolonged 
exposure to low blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels during infancy has been associated with 
impaired neurodevelopmental outcome. Active management of dietary phenylalanine and overall 
protein intake while taking sapropterin dihydrochloride is required to ensure adequate control of blood 
phenylalanine and tyrosine levels and nutritional balance. 
Health disturbances 
Consultation with a physician is recommended during illness as blood phenylalanine levels may 
increase.  
Convulsions disorders 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing sapropterin dihydrochloride to patients receiving 
treatment with levodopa. Cases of convulsion, exacerbation of convulsion, increased excitability and 
irritability have been observed during co- administration of levodopa and sapropterin in BH4-deficient 
patients (see section 4.5). 
Discontinuation of treatment 
Rebound, as defined by an increase in blood phenylalanine levels above pre-treatment levels, may 
occur upon cessation of treatment. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Although concomitant administration of inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (e.g. methotrexate, 
trimethoprim) has not been studied, such medicinal products may interfere with BH4 metabolism. 
Caution is recommended when using such medicinal products while taking sapropterin 
dihydrochloride. 
BH4 is a cofactor for nitric oxide synthetase. Caution is recommended during concomitant use of 
sapropterin dihydrochloride with all medicinal products that cause vasodilation, including those 
administered topically, by affecting nitric oxide (NO) metabolism or action including classical NO 
donors (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 
molsidomin), phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and minoxidil. 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing sapropterin dihydrochloride to patients receiving 
treatment with levodopa. Cases of convulsion, exacerbation of convulsion, increased excitability and 
irritability have been observed during co-administration of levodopa and sapropterin in BH4-deficient 
patients. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are limited amount of data from the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, 
embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Available disease-associated maternal and/or embryofoetal risk data from the Maternal 
Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study on a moderate amount of pregnancies and live births (between 
300-1 000) in PKU-affected women demonstrated that uncontrolled phenylalanine levels above 
600 μmol/l are associated with a very high incidence of neurological, cardiac, facial dysmorphism, and 
growth anomalies. 
Maternal blood phenylalanine levels must therefore be strictly controlled before and during pregnancy. 
If maternal phenylalanine levels are not strictly controlled before and during pregnancy, this could be 
harmful to the mother and the foetus. Physician-supervised restriction of dietary phenylalanine intake 
prior to and throughout pregnancy is the first choice of treatment in this patient group. 
The use of sapropterin dihydrochloride should be considered only if strict dietary management does 
not adequately reduce blood phenylalanine levels. Caution must be exercised when prescribing to 
pregnant women. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether sapropterin or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. Sapropterin 
dihydrochloride should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
In preclinical studies, no effects of sapropterin on male and female fertility were observed. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sapropterin Dipharma has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Approximately 35% of the 579 patients aged 4 years and over who received treatment with sapropterin 
dihydrochloride (5 to 20 mg/kg/day) in the clinical trials for sapropterin experienced adverse reactions. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache and rhinorrhoea. 
In  a  further  clinical  trial,  approximately  30%  of  the  27  children  aged  below  4  years  who  received 
treatment  with sapropterin dihydrochloride  (10 or 20 mg/kg/day)  experienced  adverse  reactions.  The 
most commonly reported adverse reactions are “amino acid level decreased” (hypophenylalaninaemia), 
vomiting and rhinitis. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In the pivotal clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience for sapropterin, the following adverse 
reactions have been identified. 
The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very 
rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Paediatric population 
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children were essentially similar to those in 
adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Headache and dizziness have been reported after the administration of sapropterin dihydrochloride 
above the recommended maximum dose of 20 mg/kg/day. Treatment of overdose should be directed to 
symptoms. A shortening of the QT interval (-8.32 msec) was observed in a study with a single supra-
therapeutic dose of 100 mg/kg (5 times the maximum recommended dose); this should be taken into 
consideration in managing patients who have a pre-existing shortened QT interval (e.g. patients with 
familial short QT syndrome).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, various alimentary tract 
and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX07 
Mechanism of action 
Hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) is diagnosed as an abnormal elevation in blood phenylalanine levels 
and is usually caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the genes encoding for phenylalanine 
hydroxylase enzyme (in the case of phenylketonuria, PKU) or for the enzymes involved in 6R-
tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH4) biosynthesis or regeneration (in the case of BH4 deficiency). BH4 
deficiency is a group of disorders arising from mutations or deletions in the genes encoding for one of 
the five enzymes involved in the biosynthesis or recycling of BH4. In both cases, phenylalanine 
cannot be effectively transformed into the amino acid tyrosine, leading to increased phenylalanine 
levels in the blood. 
Sapropterin is a synthetic version of the naturally occurring 6R-BH4, which is a cofactor of the 
hydroxylases for phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The rationale for administration of sapropterin dihydrochloride in patients with BH4-responsive PKU 
is to enhance the activity of the defective phenylalanine hydroxylase and thereby increase or restore 
the oxidative metabolism of phenylalanine sufficient to reduce or maintain blood phenylalanine levels, 
prevent or decrease further phenylalanine accumulation, and increase tolerance to phenylalanine intake 
in the diet. The rationale for administration of sapropterin dihydrochloride in patients with BH4 
deficiency is to replace the deficient levels of BH4, thereby restoring the activity of phenylalanine 
hydroxylase. 
Clinical efficacy 
The phase III clinical development program for sapropterin included 2, randomised placebo-controlled 
studies in patients with PKU. The results of these studies demonstrate the efficacy of sapropterin to 
reduce blood phenylalanine levels and to increase dietary phenylalanine tolerance. 
In 88 subjects with poorly controlled PKU who had elevated blood phenylalanine levels at screening, 
sapropterin dihydrochloride 10 mg/kg/day significantly reduced blood phenylalanine levels as 
compared to placebo. The baseline blood phenylalanine levels for the sapropterin-treated group and 
the placebo group were similar, with mean ± SD baseline blood phenylalanine levels of 843 
± 300 μmol/l and 888 ± 323 μmol/l, respectively. The mean ± SD decrease from baseline in blood 
phenylalanine levels at the end of the 6 week study period was 236 ± 257 μmol/l for the sapropterin 
treated group (n= 41) as compared to an increase of 2.9 ± 240 μmol/l for the placebo group (n= 47) 
(p<0.001). For patients with baseline blood phenylalanine levels ≥ 600 µmol/l, 41.9% (13/31) of those 
treated with sapropterin and 13.2% (5/38) of those treated with placebo had blood phenylalanine levels 
< 600 µmol/l at the end of the 6-week study period (p= 0.012). 
In a separate 10-week, placebo-controlled study, 45 PKU patients with blood phenylalanine levels 
controlled on a stable phenylalanine-restricted diet (blood phenylalanine ≤ 480 μmol/l on enrolment) 
were randomised 3:1 to treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg/day (n= 33) or placebo 
(n= 12). After 3-weeks of treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg/day, blood 
phenylalanine levels were significantly reduced; the mean ± SD decrease from baseline in blood 
phenylalanine level within this group was 149 ± 134 μmol/l (p<0.001). After 3 weeks, subjects in both 
the sapropterin and placebo treatment groups were continued on their phenylalanine-restricted diets 
and dietary phenylalanine intake was increased or decreased using standardised phenylalanine 
supplements with a goal to maintain blood phenylalanine levels at < 360 μmol/l. There was a 
significant difference in dietary phenylalanine tolerance in the sapropterin treatment group as 
compared to the placebo group. The mean ± SD increase in dietary phenylalanine tolerance was 17.5 
± 13.3 mg/kg/day for the group treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg/day, compared to 
3.3 ± 5.3 mg/kg/day for the placebo group (p= 0.006). For the sapropterin treatment group, the mean 
± SD total dietary phenylalanine tolerance was 38.4 ± 21.6 mg/kg/day during treatment with 
sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg/day compared to 15.7 ± 7.2 mg/kg/day before treatment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety, efficacy and population pharmacokinetics of sapropterin in paediatric patients aged 
<7 years were studied in two open-label studies. 
The first study was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled study in children <4 years old 
with a confirmed diagnosis of PKU. 56 paediatric PKU patients <4 years of age were randomised 1:1 
to receive either 10 mg/kg/day sapropterin in conjunction with a phenylalanine-restricted diet (n= 27), 
or just a phenylalanine-restricted diet (n= 29) over a 26-week Study Period. 
It was intended that all patients maintained blood phenylalanine levels within a range of 120-
360 µmol/l (defined as ≥ 120 to < 360 µmol/l) through monitored dietary intake during the 26-week 
Study Period. If after approximately 4 weeks, a patient’s phenylalanine tolerance had not increased by 
> 20% versus baseline, the sapropterin dose was increased in a single step to 20 mg/kg/day. 
The results of this study demonstrated that daily dosing with 10 or 20 mg/kg/day of sapropterin in 
conjunction with a phenylalanine-restricted diet led to statistically significant improvements in dietary 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phenylalanine tolerance compared with dietary phenylalanine restriction alone while maintaining 
blood phenylalanine levels within the target range (≥ 120 to < 360 µmol/l). The adjusted mean dietary 
phenylalanine tolerance in the sapropterin in conjunction with a phenylalanine-restricted diet group 
was 80.6 mg/kg/day and was statistically significantly greater (p< 0.001) than the adjusted mean 
dietary phenylalanine tolerance in dietary phenylalanine therapy alone group (50.1 mg/kg/day). In the 
clinical trial extension period, patients maintained dietary phenylalanine tolerance while on 
sapropterin treatment in conjunction with a phenylalanine-restricted diet, demonstrating sustained 
benefit over 3.5 years. 
The second study was a multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and 
effect on preservation of neurocognitive function of sapropterin 20 mg/kg/day in combination with a 
phenylalanine- restricted diet in children with PKU less than 7 years of age at study entry. Part 1 of the 
study (4 weeks) assessed patients’ response to sapropterin; Part 2 of the study (up to 7 years of follow-
up) evaluated neurocognitive function with age-appropriate measures, and monitored long-term safety 
in patients responsive to sapropterin. Patients with pre-existing neurocognitive damage (IQ < 80) were 
excluded from the study. Ninety-three patients were enrolled into Part 1, and 65 patients were enrolled 
into Part 2, of whom 49 (75%) patients completed the study with 27 (42%) patients providing Full 
Scale IQ (FSIQ) data at year 7. 
Mean Indices of Dietary Control were maintained between 133 μmol/L and 375 μmol/L blood 
phenylalanine for all age groups at all time points. At baseline, mean Bayley-III score (102, SD= 9.1, 
n= 27), WPPSI-III score (101, SD= 11, n= 34) and WISC-IV score (113, SD= 9.8, n= 4) were within 
the average range for the normative population. 
Among 62 patients with a minimum of two FSIQ assessments, the 95% lower limit confidence interval 
of the mean change over an average 2-year period was -1.6 points, within the clinically expected 
variation of ± 5 points. No additional adverse reactions were identified with long-term use of 
sapropterin in children less than 7 years of age. 
Limited studies have been conducted in patients under 4 years of age with BH4 deficiency using 
another formulation of the same active substance (sapropterin) or an un-registered preparation of BH4. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Sapropterin is absorbed after oral administration of the dissolved tablet, and the maximum blood 
concentration (Cmax) is achieved 3 to 4 hours after dosing in the fasted state. The rate and extent of 
absorption of sapropterin is influenced by food. The absorption of sapropterin is higher after a high-
fat, high-calorie meal as compared to fasting, resulting, in average, in 40-85% higher maximum blood 
concentrations achieved 4 to 5 hours after administration. 
Absolute bioavailability or bioavailability for humans after oral administration is not known.  
Distribution 
In non-clinical studies, sapropterin was primarily distributed to the kidneys, adrenal glands, and liver 
as assessed by levels of total and reduced biopterin concentrations. In rats, following intravenous 
radiolabeled sapropterin administration, radioactivity was found to distribute in foetuses. Excretion of 
total biopterin in milk was demonstrated in rats by intravenous route. No increase in total biopterin 
concentrations in either foetuses or milk was observed in rats after oral administration of 10 mg/kg 
sapropterin dihydrochloride. 
Biotransformation 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sapropterin dihydrochloride is primarily metabolised in the liver to dihydrobiopterin and biopterin. 
Since sapropterin dihydrochloride is a synthetic version of the naturally occurring 6R-BH4, it can be 
reasonably anticipated to undergo the same metabolism, including 6R-BH4 regeneration. 
Elimination 
Following intravenous administration in rats, sapropterin dihydrochloride is mainly excreted in the 
urine. Following oral administration it is mainly eliminated through faeces while a small proportion is 
excreted in urine. 
Population pharmacokinetics 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sapropterin including patients from birth to 49 years of age 
showed that body weight is the only covariate substantially affecting clearance or volume of 
distribution. 
Drug interactions 
In vitro studies 
In vitro, sapropterin did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or 
CYP3A4/5, nor induce CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4/5. 
Based on an in vitro study, there is potential for sapropterin dihydrochloride to inhibit p-glycoprotein 
(P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in the gut at the therapeutic doses. A higher 
intestinal concentration of sapropterin is needed to inhibit BCRP than P-gp, as inhibitory potency in 
intestine for BCRP (IC50= 267 µM) is lower than P-gp (IC50= 158 µM). 
In vivo studies 
In healthy subjects, administration of a single dose of sapropterin at the maximum therapeutic dose of 
20 mg/kg had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of digoxin (P-gp substrate) 
administered concomitantly. Based on the in vitro and in vivo results, co-administration of sapropterin 
is unlikely to increase systemic exposure to drugs that are substrates for BCRP. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology (CNS, respiratory, cardiovascular, genitourinary), and toxicity to reproduction. 
An increased incidence of altered renal microscopic morphology (collecting tubule basophilia) was 
observed in rats following chronic oral administration of sapropterin dihydrochloride at exposures at 
or slightly above the maximal recommended human dose. 
Sapropterin was found to be weakly mutagenic in bacterial cells and an increase in chromosome 
aberrations was detected in Chinese hamster lung and ovary cells. However, sapropterin has not been 
shown to be genotoxic in the in vitro test with human lymphocytes as well as in in vivo micronucleus 
mouse tests. 
No tumorigenic activity was observed in an oral carcinogenicity study in mice at doses of up to 
250 mg/kg/day (12.5 to 50 times the human therapeutic dose range). 
Emesis has been observed in both the safety pharmacology and the repeated-dose toxicity studies. 
Emesis is considered to be related to the pH of the solution containing sapropterin. 
No clear evidence of teratogenic activity was found in rats and in rabbits at doses of approximately 3 
and 10 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Sapropterin Dipharma is indicated for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in adults and 
paediatric patients of all ages with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have been shown to be responsive to 
such treatment (see section 4.2). 
Sapropterin Dipharma is also indicated for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in adults 
and paediatric patients of all ages with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency who have been shown to 
be responsive to such treatment (see section 4.2). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride must be initiated and supervised by a physician 
experienced in the treatment of PKU and BH4 deficiency. 
Active management of dietary phenylalanine and overall protein intake while taking this medicinal 
product is required to ensure adequate control of blood phenylalanine levels and nutritional balance. 
As HPA due to either PKU or BH4 deficiency is a chronic condition, once responsiveness is 
demonstrated, Sapropterin Dipharma is intended for long-term use (see section 5.1). 
Posology 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PKU 
The starting dose of sapropterin dihydrochloride in adult and paediatric patients with PKU is 10 mg/kg 
body weight once daily. The dose is adjusted, usually between 5 and 20 mg/kg/day, to achieve and 
maintain adequate blood phenylalanine levels as defined by the physician. 
BH4 deficiency 
The starting dose of sapropterin dihydrochloride in adult and paediatric patients with BH4 deficiency 
is 2 to 5 mg/kg body weight total daily dose. Doses may be adjusted up to a total of 20 mg/kg per day. 
For patients above 20 kg body weight, the calculated daily dose based on body weight should be 
rounded to the nearest multiple of 100 mg. 
Dose adjustment 
Treatment with sapropterin may decrease blood phenylalanine levels below the desired therapeutic 
level. Adjustment of the sapropterin dihydrochloride dose or modification of dietary phenylalanine 
intake may be required to achieve and maintain blood phenylalanine levels within the desired 
therapeutic range. 
Blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels should be tested, particularly in the paediatric population, one 
to two weeks after each dose adjustment and monitored frequently thereafter, under the direction of 
the treating physician. 
If inadequate control of blood phenylalanine levels is observed during treatment with sapropterin 
dihydrochloride, the patient’s adherence to the prescribed treatment, and diet, should be reviewed 
before considering an adjustment of the dose of sapropterin. 
Discontinuation of treatment should be done only under the supervision of a physician. More frequent 
monitoring may be required, as blood phenylalanine levels may increase. Dietary modification may be 
necessary to maintain blood phenylalanine levels within the desired therapeutic range. 
Determination of response 
It is of primary importance to initiate treatment as early as possible to avoid the appearance of non-
reversible clinical manifestations of neurological disorders in paediatric patients and cognitive deficits 
and psychiatric disorders in adults due to sustained elevations of blood phenylalanine. 
Response to this medicinal product is determined by a decrease in blood phenylalanine.Blood 
phenylalanine levels should be checked before administering sapropterin dihydrochloride and after 1 
week of use at the recommended starting dose. If an unsatisfactory reduction in blood phenylalanine 
levels is observed, then the dose can be increased weekly to a maximum of 20 mg/kg/day, with 
continued weekly monitoring of blood phenylalanine levels over a one month period. The dietary 
phenylalanine intake should be maintained at a constant level during this period. 
A satisfactory response is defined as a ≥ 30 percent reduction in blood phenylalanine levels or 
attainment of the therapeutic blood phenylalanine goals defined for an individual patient by the 
treating physician. Patients who fail to achieve this level of response within the described one month 
test period should be considered non-responsive, these patients should not be treated with sapropterin 
dihydrochloride and administration of sapropterin dihydrochloride should be discontinued. 
Once responsiveness to the medicinal product has been established, the dose may be adjusted within 
the range of 5 to 20 mg/kg/day according to response to therapy. 
It is recommended that blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels be tested one or two weeks after each 
dose adjustment and monitored frequently thereafter under the direction of the treating physician. 
Patients treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride must continue a restricted phenylalanine diet and 
undergo regular clinical assessment (such as monitoring of blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, 
nutrient intake, and psycho- motor development).

Special populations  
Elderly 
Safety and efficacy of sapropterin dihydrochloride in patients above 65 years of age have not been 
established. Caution must be exercised when prescribing to elderly patients. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Safety and efficacy of sapropterin dihydrochloride in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency have 
not been established. Caution must be exercised when prescribing to such patients. 
Paediatric population 
The posology is the same in adults, children, and adolescents. 
Method of administration 
Oral use, after dissolution. 
Sapropterin Dipharma should be administered with a meal, to increase the absorption. 
For patients with PKU, Sapropterin Dipharma should be administered as a single daily dose, and at the 
same time each day preferably in the morning. 
For patients with BH4 deficiency, divide the total daily dose into 2 or 3 administrations, distributed 
over the day. 
The solution should be consumed within 30 minutes of initial dissolution. Unused solution should be 
discarded after administration. 
Patients above 20 kg body weight 
The contents of the sachet(s) should be placed in 120 to 240 ml of water and stirred until dissolved. 
Children up to 20 kg body weight (use only 100 mg powder sachets) 
The measuring devices required for dosing in children up to 20 kg body weight (i.e. cup with 
graduations at 20, 40, 60, 80 ml; 10 ml and 20 ml oral syringes with graduation at 1 ml divisions) are 
not included in the Sapropterin Dipharma pack. These devices are supplied to the specialised 
paediatric centres for inborn errors of metabolism to be provided to the caregivers of the patients. 
The appropriate number of 100 mg sachet(s) should be dissolved in a volume of water depicted in 
Tables 1-4 based on the prescribed total daily dose. 
If only a portion of this solution needs to be administered, an oral syringe should be used to withdraw 
the volume of solution to be administered. The solution may then be transferred to another cup for 
administration of the medicinal product. For small infants, an oral syringe can be used. A 10 ml oral 
syringe should be used for administration of volumes of ≤ 10 ml and a 20 ml oral syringe for 
administration of volumes of > 10 ml.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Dietary intake 
Patients treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride must continue a restricted phenylalanine diet and 
undergo regular clinical assessment (such as monitoring of blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, 
nutrient intake, and psycho- motor development). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Low blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels 
Sustained or recurrent dysfunction in the phenylalanine-tyrosine-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (DOPA) 
metabolic pathway can result in deficient body protein and neurotransmitter synthesis. Prolonged 
exposure to low blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels during infancy has been associated with 
impaired neurodevelopmental outcome. Active management of dietary phenylalanine and overall 
protein intake while taking sapropterin dihydrochloride is required to ensure adequate control of blood 
phenylalanine and tyrosine levels and nutritional balance. 
Health disturbances 
Consultation with a physician is recommended during illness as blood phenylalanine levels may 
increase.  
Convulsions disorders 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing sapropterin dihydrochloride to patients receiving 
treatment with levodopa. Cases of convulsion, exacerbation of convulsion, increased excitability and 
irritability have been observed during co- administration of levodopa and sapropterin in BH4-deficient 
patients (see section 4.5). 
Discontinuation of treatment 
Rebound, as defined by an increase in blood phenylalanine levels above pre-treatment levels, may 
occur upon cessation of treatment. 
Potassium content 
Sapropterin Dipharma 100 mg powder for oral solution 
This medicinal product contains 0.3 mmol (11.7 mg) potassium per sachet. To be taken into 
consideration by patients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet.  
Sapropterin Dipharma 500 mg powder for oral solution 
This medicinal product contains 1.6 mmol (62.6 mg) potassium per sachet. To be taken into 
consideration by patients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Although concomitant administration of inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (e.g. methotrexate, 
trimethoprim) has not been studied, such medicinal products may interfere with BH4 metabolism. 
Caution is recommended when using such medicinal products while taking sapropterin 
dihydrochloride. 
BH4 is a cofactor for nitric oxide synthetase. Caution is recommended during concomitant use of 
sapropterin dihydrochloride with all medicinal products that cause vasodilation, including those 
administered topically, by affecting nitric oxide (NO) metabolism or action including classical NO 
donors (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 
molsidomin), phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and minoxidil. 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing sapropterin dihydrochloride to patients receiving 
treatment with levodopa. Cases of convulsion, exacerbation of convulsion, increased excitability and 
irritability have been observed during co- administration of levodopa and sapropterin in BH4-deficient 
patients.

Pregnancy 
There are limited amount of data from the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, 
embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. 
Available disease-associated maternal and/or embryofoetal risk data from the Maternal 
Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study on a moderate amount of pregnancies and live births (between 
300 - 1 000) in PKU-affected women demonstrated that uncontrolled phenylalanine levels above 
600 μmol/l are associated with a very high incidence of neurological, cardiac, facial dysmorphism, and 
growth anomalies. 
Maternal blood phenylalanine levels must therefore be strictly controlled before and during pregnancy. 
If maternal phenylalanine levels are not strictly controlled before and during pregnancy, this could be 
harmful to the mother and the foetus. Physician-supervised restriction of dietary phenylalanine intake 
prior to and throughout pregnancy is the first choice of treatment in this patient group. 
The use of sapropterin dihydrochloride should be considered only if strict dietary management does 
not adequately reduce blood phenylalanine levels. Caution must be exercised when prescribing to 
pregnant women. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether sapropterin or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. sapropterin 
dihydrochloride should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
In preclinical studies, no effects of sapropterin on male and female fertility were observed. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sapropterin Dipharma has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Approximately 35% of the 579 patients aged 4 years and over who received treatment with sapropterin 
dihydrochloride (5 to 20 mg/kg/day) in the clinical trials for sapropterin experienced adverse reactions. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache and rhinorrhoea. 
In a further clinical trial, approximately 30% of the 27 children aged below 4 years who received 
treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride (10 or 20 mg/kg/day) experienced adverse reactions. The 
most commonly reported adverse reactions are “amino acid level decreased” 
(hypophenylalaninaemia), vomiting and rhinitis. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In the pivotal clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience for sapropterin, the following adverse 
reactions have been identified. 
The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1,000), very 
rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
Immune system disorders

Diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea  
Gastritis, oesophagitis 
Paediatric population 
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children were essentially similar to those in 
adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Headache and dizziness have been reported after the administration of sapropterin dihydrochloride 
above the recommended maximum dose of 20 mg/kg/day. Treatment of overdose should be directed to 
symptoms. A shortening of the QT interval (-8.32 msec) was observed in a study with a single supra-
therapeutic dose of 100 mg/kg (5 times the maximum recommended dose); this should be taken into 
consideration in managing patients who have a pre-existing shortened QT interval (e.g. patients with 
familial short QT syndrome).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, various alimentary tract 
and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX07 
Mechanism of action 
Hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) is diagnosed as an abnormal elevation in blood phenylalanine levels 
and is usually caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the genes encoding for phenylalanine 
hydroxylase enzyme (in the case of phenylketonuria, PKU) or for the enzymes involved in 6R-
tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH4) biosynthesis or regeneration (in the case of BH4 deficiency). BH4 
deficiency is a group of disorders arising from mutations or deletions in the genes encoding for one of 
the five enzymes involved in the biosynthesis or recycling of BH4. In both cases, phenylalanine 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cannot be effectively transformed into the amino acid tyrosine, leading to increased phenylalanine 
levels in the blood. 
Sapropterin is a synthetic version of the naturally occurring 6R-BH4, which is a cofactor of the 
hydroxylases for phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. 
The rationale for administration of sapropterin dihydrochloride in patients with BH4-responsive PKU 
is to enhance the activity of the defective phenylalanine hydroxylase and thereby increase or restore 
the oxidative metabolism of phenylalanine sufficient to reduce or maintain blood phenylalanine levels, 
prevent or decrease further phenylalanine accumulation, and increase tolerance to phenylalanine intake 
in the diet. The rationale for administration of sapropterin dihydrochloride in patients with BH4 
deficiency is to replace the deficient levels of BH4, thereby restoring the activity of phenylalanine 
hydroxylase. 
Clinical efficacy 
The phase III clinical development program for sapropterin included 2, randomised placebo-controlled 
studies in patients with PKU. The results of these studies demonstrate the efficacy of sapropterin to 
reduce blood phenylalanine levels and to increase dietary phenylalanine tolerance. 
In 88 subjects with poorly controlled PKU who had elevated blood phenylalanine levels at screening, 
sapropterin dihydrochloride 10 mg/kg/day significantly reduced blood phenylalanine levels as 
compared to placebo. The baseline blood phenylalanine levels for the sapropterin-treated group and 
the placebo group were similar, with mean ± SD baseline blood phenylalanine levels of 843 
± 300 μmol/l and 888 ± 323 μmol/l, respectively. The mean ± SD decrease from baseline in blood 
phenylalanine levels at the end of the 6 week study period was 236 ± 257 μmol/l for the sapropterin 
treated group (n= 41) as compared to an increase of 2.9 ± 240 μmol/l for the placebo group (n= 47) 
(p< 0.001). For patients with baseline blood phenylalanine levels ≥ 600 µmol/l, 41.9% (13/31) of those 
treated with sapropterin and 13.2% (5/38) of those treated with placebo had blood phenylalanine levels 
< 600 µmol/l at the end of the 6-week study period (p= 0.012). 
In a separate 10-week, placebo-controlled study, 45 PKU patients with blood phenylalanine levels 
controlled on a stable phenylalanine-restricted diet (blood phenylalanine ≤ 480 μmol/l on enrolment) 
were randomised 3:1 to treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg/day (n= 33) or placebo 
(n= 12). After 3-weeks of treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg/day, blood 
phenylalanine levels were significantly reduced; the mean ± SD decrease from baseline in blood 
phenylalanine level within this group was 149 ± 134 μmol/l (p< 0.001). After 3 weeks, subjects in 
both the sapropterin and placebo treatment groups were continued on their phenylalanine-restricted 
diets and dietary phenylalanine intake was increased or decreased using standardised phenylalanine 
supplements with a goal to maintain blood phenylalanine levels at < 360 μmol/l. There was a 
significant difference in dietary phenylalanine tolerance in the sapropterin treatment group as 
compared to the placebo group. The mean ± SD increase in dietary phenylalanine tolerance was 17.5 
± 13.3 mg/kg/day for the group treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg/day, compared to 
3.3 ± 5.3 mg/kg/day for the placebo group (p= 0.006). For the sapropterin treatment group, the mean 
± SD total dietary phenylalanine tolerance was 38.4 ± 21.6 mg/kg/day during treatment with 
sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg/day compared to 15.7 ± 7.2 mg/kg/day before treatment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety, efficacy and population pharmacokinetics of sapropterin in paediatric patients aged < 7 
years were studied in two open-label studies. 
The first study was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled study in children < 4 years old 
with a confirmed diagnosis of PKU. 
56 paediatric PKU patients < 4 years of age were randomised 1:1 to receive either 10 mg/kg/day 
sapropterin in conjunction with a phenylalanine-restricted diet (n= 27), or just a phenylalanine-
restricted diet (n= 29) over a 26-week Study Period. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It was intended that all patients maintained blood phenylalanine levels within a range of 120-
360 µmol/l (defined as ≥ 120 to < 360 µmol/l) through monitored dietary intake during the 26-week 
Study Period. If after approximately 4 weeks, a patient’s phenylalanine tolerance had not increased by 
> 20% versus baseline, the sapropterin dose was increased in a single step to 20 mg/kg/day. 
The results of this study demonstrated that daily dosing with 10 or 20 mg/kg/day of sapropterin in 
conjunction with a phenylalanine-restricted diet led to statistically significant improvements in dietary 
phenylalanine tolerance compared with dietary phenylalanine restriction alone while maintaining 
blood phenylalanine levels within the target range (≥ 120 to < 360 µmol/l). The adjusted mean dietary 
phenylalanine tolerance in the sapropterin in conjunction with a phenylalanine-restricted diet group 
was 80.6 mg/kg/day and was statistically significantly greater (p< 0.001) than the adjusted mean 
dietary phenylalanine tolerance in dietary phenylalanine therapy alone group (50.1 mg/kg/day). In the 
clinical trial extension period, patients maintained dietary phenylalanine tolerance while on 
sapropterin treatment in conjunction with a phenylalanine-restricted diet, demonstrating sustained 
benefit over 3.5 years. 
The second study was a multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and 
effect on preservation of neurocognitive function of sapropterin 20 mg/kg/day in combination with a 
phenylalanine- restricted diet in children with PKU less than 7 years of age at study entry. Part 1 of the 
study (4 weeks) assessed patients’ response to sapropterin; Part 2 of the study (up to 7 years of follow-
up) evaluated neurocognitive function with age-appropriate measures, and monitored long-term safety 
in patients responsive to sapropterin. Patients with pre-existing neurocognitive damage (IQ < 80) were 
excluded from the study. Ninety-three patients were enrolled into Part 1, and 65 patients were enrolled 
into Part 2, of whom 49 (75%) patients completed the study with 27 (42%) patients providing Full 
Scale IQ (FSIQ) data at year 7. 
Mean Indices of Dietary Control were maintained between 133 μmol/L and 375 μmol/L blood 
phenylalanine for all age groups at all time points. At baseline, mean Bayley-III score (102, SD= 9.1, 
n= 27), WPPSI-III score (101, SD= 11, n= 34) and WISC-IV score (113, SD= 9.8, n= 4) were within 
the average range for the normative population. 
Among 62 patients with a minimum of two FSIQ assessments, the 95% lower limit confidence interval 
of the mean change over an average 2-year period was -1.6 points, within the clinically expected 
variation of ± 5 points. No additional adverse reactions were identified with long-term use of 
sapropterin in children less than 7 years of age. 
Limited studies have been conducted in patients under 4 years of age with BH4 deficiency using 
another formulation of the same active substance (sapropterin) or an un-registered preparation of BH4. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Sapropterin is absorbed after oral administration of the dissolved tablet, and the maximum blood 
concentration (Cmax) is achieved 3 to 4 hours after dosing in the fasted state. The rate and extent of 
absorption of sapropterin is influenced by food. The absorption of sapropterin is higher after a high-
fat, high-calorie meal as compared to fasting, resulting, in average, in 40-85% higher maximum blood 
concentrations achieved 4 to 5 hours after administration. 
Absolute bioavailability or bioavailability for humans after oral administration is not known.  
Distribution 
In non-clinical studies, sapropterin was primarily distributed to the kidneys, adrenal glands, and liver 
as assessed by levels of total and reduced biopterin concentrations. In rats, following intravenous 
radiolabeled sapropterin administration, radioactivity was found to distribute in foetuses. Excretion of 
total biopterin in milk was demonstrated in rats by intravenous route. No increase in total biopterin 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentrations in either foetuses or milk was observed in rats after oral administration of 10 mg/kg 
sapropterin dihydrochloride. 
Biotransformation 
Sapropterin dihydrochloride is primarily metabolised in the liver to dihydrobiopterin and biopterin. 
Since sapropterin dihydrochloride is a synthetic version of the naturally occurring 6R-BH4, it can be 
reasonably anticipated to undergo the same metabolism, including 6R-BH4 regeneration. 
Elimination 
Following intravenous administration in rats, sapropterin dihydrochloride is mainly excreted in the 
urine. Following oral administration it is mainly eliminated through faeces while a small proportion is 
excreted in urine. 
Population pharmacokinetics 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sapropterin including patients from birth to 49 years of age 
showed that body weight is the only covariate substantially affecting clearance or volume of 
distribution. 
Drug interactions 
In vitro studies 
In vitro, sapropterin did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or 
CYP3A4/5, nor induce CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4/5. 
Based on an in vitro study, there is potential for sapropterin dihydrochloride to inhibit p-glycoprotein 
(P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in the gut at the therapeutic doses. A higher 
intestinal concentration of sapropterin is needed to inhibit BCRP than P-gp, as inhibitory potency in 
intestine for BCRP (IC50= 267 µM) is lower than P-gp (IC50= 158 µM). 
In vivo studies 
In healthy subjects, administration of a single dose of sapropterin at the maximum therapeutic dose of 
20 mg/kg had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of digoxin (P-gp substrate) 
administered concomitantly. Based on the in vitro and in vivo results, co-administration of sapropterin 
is unlikely to increase systemic exposure to drugs that are substrates for BCRP. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology (CNS, respiratory, cardiovascular, genitourinary), and toxicity to reproduction. 
An increased incidence of altered renal microscopic morphology (collecting tubule basophilia) was 
observed in rats following chronic oral administration of sapropterin dihydrochloride at exposures at 
or slightly above the maximal recommended human dose. 
Sapropterin was found to be weakly mutagenic in bacterial cells and an increase in chromosome 
aberrations was detected in Chinese hamster lung and ovary cells. However, sapropterin has not been 
shown to be genotoxic in the in vitro test with human lymphocytes as well as in in vivo micronucleus 
mouse tests. 
No tumorigenic activity was observed in an oral carcinogenicity study in mice at doses of up to 
250 mg/kg/day (12.5 to 50 times the human therapeutic dose range). 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Emesis has been observed in both the safety pharmacology and the repeated-dose toxicity studies. 
Emesis is considered to be related to the pH of the solution containing sapropterin. 
No clear evidence of teratogenic activity was found in rats and in rabbits at doses of approximately 3 
and 10 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Sapropterin Dipharma is and what it is used for 
Sapropterin Dipharma contains the active substance sapropterin which is a synthetic copy of a body’s 
own substance called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). BH4 is required by the body to use an amino acid 
called phenylalanine in order to build another amino acid called tyrosine. 
Sapropterin Dipharma is used to treat hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) or phenylketonuria (PKU) in 
patients of all ages. HPA and PKU are due to abnormally high levels of phenylalanine in the blood 
which can be harmful. Sapropterin Dipharma reduces these levels in some patients who respond to 
BH4 and can help increase the amount of phenylalanine that can be included in the diet. 
This medicine is also used to treat an inherited disease called BH4 deficiency in patients of all ages, in 
which the body cannot produce enough BH4. Because of very low BH4 levels phenylalanine is not 
used properly and its levels rise, resulting in harmful effects. By replacing the BH4 that the body 
cannot produce, Sapropterin Dipharma reduces the harmful excess of phenylalanine in the blood and 
increases the dietary tolerance to phenylalanine. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Sapropterin Dipharma  
Do not take Sapropterin Dipharma 
- 
if you are allergic to sapropterin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Sapropterin Dipharma, particularly: 
- 
- 
- 
if you are 65 years of age or older 
if you have problems with your kidney or liver 
if you are ill. Consultation with a physician is recommended during illness as blood 
phenylalanine levels may increase 
if you have predisposition to convulsions 
- 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When you are treated with Sapropterin Dipharma, your doctor will test your blood to verify how much 
phenylalanine and tyrosine it contains and may decide to adjust the dose of Sapropterin Dipharma or 
your diet if needed. 
You must continue your diet treatment as recommended by your doctor. Do not change your diet 
without contacting your doctor. Even if you take Sapropterin Dipharma, if your phenylalanine blood 
levels are not well controlled, you can develop severe neurologic problems. Your doctor should 
continue to monitor your blood phenylalanine levels often during your treatment with Sapropterin 
Dipharma, to make sure that your blood phenylalanine levels are not too high or too low. 
Other medicines and Sapropterin Dipharma 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. In particular you should tell your doctor if you are using: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
levodopa (used to treat Parkinson’s disease) 
medicines for treatment of cancer (e.g. methotrexate) 
medicines for treatment of bacterial infections (e.g. trimethoprim) 
medicines that cause dilation of blood vessels, (such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), isosorbide 
dinitrate (ISDN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), molsidomin, minoxidil). 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
If you are pregnant your doctor will tell you how to control phenylalanine levels adequately. If these 
are not strictly controlled before or when you become pregnant, this could be harmful to you and to 
your baby. Your doctor will monitor the restriction of dietary phenylalanine intake prior and during 
pregnancy. 
If the strict diet does not adequately reduce phenylalanine amount in your blood your doctor will 
consider whether you must take this medicine. 
You should not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Sapropterin Dipharma is not expected to affect the ability to drive and use machines. 
Sapropterin Dipharma contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to take Sapropterin Dipharma 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Dosing for PKU 
The recommended starting dose of Sapropterin Dipharma in patients with PKU is 10 mg for each kg 
of body weight. Take Sapropterin Dipharma as a single daily dose with a meal to increase the 
absorption, and at the same time each day, preferably in the morning. Your doctor may adjust your 
dose, usually between 5 and 20 mg for each kg of body weight per day, depending on your condition. 
Dosing for BH4 deficiency 
The recommended starting dose of Sapropterin Dipharma in patients with BH4 deficiency is 2 to 5 mg 
for each kg of body weight. Take Sapropterin Dipharma with a meal to increase the absorption. Divide 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the total daily dose into 2 or 3 doses, taken over the day. Your doctor may adjust your dose up to 
20 mg for each kg of body weight per day, depending on your condition.

Method of administration 
For PKU patients, the total daily dose is taken once a day at the same time each day, preferably in the 
morning. 
For BH4 deficiency patients, the total daily dose is divided into 2 or 3 doses over the day. 
Use in all patients 
Place the prescribed number of tablets in a glass or cup of water as accurately described below and stir 
until dissolved. 
It may take a few minutes for the tablets to dissolve. To make the tablets dissolve faster you can crush 
them. Small particles may be visible in the solution, but they will not affect the effectiveness of the 
medicine. 
Drink the dissolved preparation of Sapropterin Dipharma with a meal within 15 to 20 minutes of its 
preparation.  
Use in patients above 20 kg body weight 
Place the tablets in a glass or cup (120 to 240 ml) of water and stir until dissolved. 
Use in children up to 20 kg body weight 
The dose is based on body weight. This will change as your child grows. Your doctor will tell you: 
• 
• 
• 
the number of Sapropterin Dipharma tablets needed for one dose 
the amount of water needed to mix one dose of Sapropterin Dipharma 
the amount of solution you will need to give your child for their prescribed dose. 
Your child should drink the solution with a meal. 
Give your child the prescribed amount of solution within 15 to 20 minutes after dissolving. If you are 
not able to give your child’s dose within 15 to 20 minutes after dissolving the tablets, you will need to 
prepare a new solution as the unused solution should not be used beyond 20 minutes. 
Supplies needed to prepare and give your child’s dose of Sapropterin Dipharma 
• 
The number of Sapropterin Dipharma tablets needed for one dose 
• 
A medicine cup with graduation markings at 20, 40, 60 and 80 ml 
• 
A glass or cup 
• 
Small spoon or clean utensil for stirring 
• 
Oral syringe (graduated in 1 ml divisions) (10 ml syringe for administration of volumes of 
≤ 10 ml or 20 ml syringe for administration of volumes of > 10 ml) 
Ask your doctor for the medicine cup for dissolving the tablets and the 10 ml or 20 ml oral syringe if 
you do not have these supplies. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Steps for preparing and taking your dose: 
• 
Place the prescribed number of tablets in the medicine cup. Pour the amount of water into the 
medicine cup, as instructed by your doctor (e.g. your doctor told you to use 20 ml for dissolving 
one Sapropterin Dipharma tablet). Check to make sure that the amount of liquid lines up with 
the amount that your doctor tells you. Stir with the small spoon or clean utensil until the tablets 
dissolve. 
If your doctor told you to administer only a portion of the solution, point the tip of the oral 
syringe into the medicine cup. Slowly pull back the plunger to withdraw the amount as 
instructed by your doctor. 
Transfer the solution by pushing on the plunger slowly until all of the solution in the oral 
syringe is transferred to a glass or cup for administration (e.g. if your doctor told you to dissolve 
two Sapropterin Dipharma tablets in 40 ml water and administer 30 ml to your child, you would 
have to use the 20 ml oral syringe two times to draw up 30 ml (e.g. 20 ml + 10 ml) of the 
solution and transfer it to a glass or cup for administration). Use a 10 ml oral syringe for 
administration of volumes ≤ 10 ml or a 20 ml oral syringe for administration of volumes 
>10 ml. 
If your baby is too small to drink from a glass or a cup you may administer the solution via the 
oral syringe. Draw up the prescribed volume from the solution prepared in the medicine cup and 
place the tip of the oral syringe into your baby’s mouth. Point the tip of the oral syringe towards 
either cheek. Push on the plunger slowly, a small amount at a time, until all of the solution in 
the oral syringe is given. 
Throw away any remaining solution. Remove the plunger from the barrel of the oral syringe. 
Wash both parts of the oral syringe and the medicine cup with warm water and air dry. When 
the oral syringe is dry, put the plunger back into the barrel. Store the oral syringe and the 
medicine cup for next use.

If you take more Sapropterin Dipharma than you should 
If you take more Sapropterin Dipharma than prescribed, you may experience side effects that could 
include headache and dizziness. Immediately contact your doctor or pharmacist if you take more 
Sapropterin Dipharma than prescribed. 
If you forget to take Sapropterin Dipharma 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take the next dose at the usual time. 
If you stop taking Sapropterin Dipharma 
Do not stop taking Sapropterin Dipharma without prior discussion with your doctor, as phenylalanine 
levels in your blood may increase. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

≤ 10 ml or 20 ml syringe for administration of volumes of >10 ml) 
Ask your doctor for the medicine cup for dissolving the powder and the 10 ml or 20 ml oral syringe if 
you do not have these supplies. 
Steps for preparing and taking your dose: 
• 
Place the prescribed number of Sapropterin Dipharma 100 mg sachets in the medicine cup. Pour 
the amount of water into the cup, as instructed by your doctor (e.g. your doctor told you to use 
20 ml for dissolving one Sapropterin Dipharma sachet). Check to make sure that the amount of 
liquid lines up with the amount that your doctor tells you. Stir with the small spoon or clean 
utensil until the powder dissolves. After dissolving the powder in water, the solution must be 
clear, colourless to yellow. 
If your doctor told you to administer only a portion of the solution, point the tip of the oral 
syringe into the medicine cup. Slowly pull back the plunger to withdraw the amount as 
instructed by your doctor. 
Transfer the solution by pushing on the plunger slowly until all of the solution in the oral 
syringe is transferred to a glass or cup for administration (e.g. if your doctor told you to dissolve 
two Sapropterin Dipharma 100 mg sachets in 40 ml water and administer 30 ml to your child, 
you would have to use the 20 ml oral syringe two times to draw up 30 ml (e.g. 20 ml + 10 ml) of 
the solution and transfer it to a glass or cup for administration). Use a 10 ml oral syringe for 
administration of volumes ≤ 10 ml or a 20 ml oral syringe for administration of volumes 
>10 ml. 
If your baby is too small to drink from a glass or a cup you may administer the solution via the 
oral syringe. Draw up the prescribed volume from the solution prepared in the medicine cup and 
place the tip of the oral syringe into your baby’s mouth. Point the tip of the oral syringe towards 
either cheek. Push on the plunger slowly, a small amount at a time, until all of the solution in 
the oral syringe is given. 
Throw away any remaining solution. Remove the plunger from the barrel of the oral syringe. 
Wash both parts of the oral syringe and the medicine cup with warm water and air dry. When 
the oral syringe is dry, put the plunger back into the barrel. Store the oral syringe and the 
medicine cup for next use.

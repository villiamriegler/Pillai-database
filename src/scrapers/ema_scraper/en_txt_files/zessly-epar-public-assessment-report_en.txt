2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) plays an important pathogenic role in multiple inflammatory diseases. 
Inhibition of the TNF receptor-ligand interaction by TNF antagonist therapy results in down regulation of 
mediators of the inflammatory cascade and is associated with clinical improvement of inflammatory diseases 
such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriasis, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease among others. 
Zessly has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product, with the TNF-α inhibitor Remicade 
(infliximab) as the reference medicinal product.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018

About the product 
Zessly contains the active substance infliximab. Infliximab is a recombinant chimeric IgG1 kappa monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) composed of complementarity-determining regions derived from mouse anti-human TNF-α 
mAB and framework, and constant regions derived from human Immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG1). Zessly is 
produced using a recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary cell culture process and is capable of binding to 
human TNF in a dose-dependent manner and neutralizing its effects. 
Zessly finished product is supplied as a sterile, white lyophilised powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion. Zessly is presented as a vial containing 100 mg infliximab, to be administered via intravenous 
infusion, at the same dose as Remicade. 
The proposed clinical use of Zessly is identical to that of the reference medicinal product, Remicade. Zessly is 
proposed for the treatment of adult patients with Rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, Ulcerative colitis, 
ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis; and the treatment of paediatric patients with Crohn’s 
disease and Ulcerative colitis.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Zessly (infliximab), has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product, with Remicade as the 
reference medicinal product. The biosimilar development was initially carried out by Pfizer. Sandoz acquired 
the rights for seeking marketing authorization and commercialization of Zessly in the European Economic 
Area (EEA). Approved comparator products are referred to by regional source, i.e. EU-authorized Remicade 
(referred to as Remicade-EU in tables and figures) and US-licensed Remicade (referred to as Remicade-US in 
tables and figures).  
The finished product is presented as a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 100 mg of 
infliximab as active substance. 
Other ingredients are: disodium succinate hexahydrate, succinic acid, sucrose and polysorbate 80. 
The product is available in a type 1 glass vial with rubber stopper and aluminium crimp protected by a plastic 
cap. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Infliximab is a recombinant chimeric IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody composed of complementarity-
determining regions derived from mouse anti-human TNF-α mAB and framework, and constant regions 
derived from human IgG1. Zessly is produced by a recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture 
process and is capable of binding to human TNF in a dose dependent manner and neutralizing its effects. 
Zessly has two identical heavy (H) chains and two identical light (L) chains, covalently linked with four inter-
chain disulfide bonds. The N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence in the CH2 region is essentially fully 
occupied with asialo, core-fucosylated, complex-type biantennary N-linked glycans with zero and one 
terminal galactose residues, abbreviated as G0F and G1F, respectively. C-terminal lysine is observed at minor 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 13/106 
 
  
  
levels in the mature, secreted form of Zessly, presumably due to incomplete intracellular processing by CHO 
cellular proteases. The penultimate glycine residue is the predominant H chain C-terminus in Zessly. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
Zessly active substance is manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co KG, Germany. The 
manufacturing process for the active substance uses a recombinant CHO cell line that contains the 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) encoding the sequence for infliximab and is grown in suspension culture using 
chemically-defined, animal-derived component-free media. Cells from a vial of the working cell bank (WCB) 
are thawed, and the culture is progressively expanded until the production bioreactor is inoculated. 
Conditioned medium containing the active substance is generated in the production bioreactor, with 
maximum cultivation time established by LIVCA. A description and corresponding acceptance criteria for 
handling of cell cultures to the next step in the culture expansion process including the production bioreactor 
and the precise ending of the production step have been provided. The criticality of these process parameters 
has also been evaluated. The production bioreactor culture is harvested, followed by clarification by 
centrifugation and depth filtration to remove cells and debris. 
Information has been provided for control of the inoculum cultures during the expansion phase, to ensure 
that the maximum generation number is not exceeded during a production run and this has been sufficiently 
represented by the validation studies.  
After the harvest step, the active substance is purified using a series of chromatography and filtration steps 
and a virus inactivation step. Excipients are added to achieve the final formulation of the active substance, 
followed by final filtration.  
Information on the column sizes, buffer volumes and acceptable flow rates have been given for the 
purification process.  
Control of materials 
Details of the various solutions and media used in the manufacturing process are described. No animal-
derived materials or excipients are used in the establishment of the MCB, WCB, active substance or finished 
product manufacturing. Both compendial and non-compendial raw materials are used during production of 
Zessly. The water for injections (WFI) meets Ph. Eur. requirements. Information and testing for raw materials 
is given. 
The host cell line used in Zessly manufacturing is a CHO cell line. The host MCB was tested extensively to 
confirm the absence of adventitious contaminants. Gene and vector construction have been described and 
are satisfactory. Development of the production cell line, including cloning and expansion, are detailed. The 
amino acid sequence of Zessly was confirmed with 100% sequence coverage. 
Details of generation of the MCB in accordance with ICH Q5D guidelines and GMP requirements have been 
provided. Clonality of the cell line was confirmed in the MCB. Details of testing for the MCB (in line with ICH 
Q5A, ICH Q5D and Ph. Eur. where appropriate) are given, including purity and viability testing, identity 
testing for the cell line, microbiological safety tests and virus safety tests (in vitro and in vivo assays), which 
were satisfactory.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018

A working cell bank was established from the MCB. The purity of the Zessly WCB cells was confirmed, with no 
detectable adventitious microbial or viral agents introduced into the WCB.  
The MCB and WCB have been assigned a shelf life from the date of retesting. 
The proposed age for the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) for the Zessly cell line and production process has 
been justified. The Zessly end-of-production LIVCA cells were tested for purity and shown to be free of viral 
and bacterial contamination. End-of-production cells demonstrated genotypic consistency compared with MCB 
and WCB. Phenotypic characteristics also demonstrated stability across process validation batches and clinical 
batches.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
For the control of the Zessly active substance manufacturing process, Critical Process Parameters (CPP), non-
CPP, Critical Material Attributes and in-process tests have been defined for each step in the process. The 
criticality is associated with the impact on the defined critical quality attribute (CQA) of the Zessly. CQAs for 
Zessly are given and are satisfactory. Process controls have been defined and are based on development 
experience and risk assessments, which are sufficiently detailed in the submission. Results from these 
assessments and studies were used in the determination of appropriate process parameter and material 
attribute process validation (PV) control limits and process performance and product quality PV acceptance 
criteria. The control strategy is satisfactory. 
Process validation 
The active substance manufacturing process has been validated. All release results met acceptance criteria 
and the proposed commercial specifications. Consistency of each of the unit operations was demonstrated in 
the validation studies. Validation of the purification process has been conducted to confirm that each of the 
chromatography and filtration steps show consistent product yield and reduce the impurity content to an 
acceptably low level in the active substance. The impurities include e.g. host cell proteins (HCP), DNA or 
elemental impurities. All impurities were cleared with an acceptable safety margin, based on worst-case 
assumptions. 
In-process pool hold times were validated to demonstrate biochemical stability of Zessly over defined periods 
of time. The hold study confirmed that no significant changes were observed. Sanitary processing of the 
process equipment and product intermediates used in the manufacturing of Zessly was demonstrated.  
Shipping qualification has been provided for frozen active substance. 
Manufacturing process development 
No changes were made in the manufacturing scale during process development. Process performance was 
evaluated during several large-scale manufacturing campaigns. All clinical and process validation batches 
were manufactured at the commercial site and scale (Boehringer Ingelheim, Biberach, Germany). Throughout 
process development, the purification process has remained largely unchanged. The formulation of active 
substance was the same throughout process development. Comparability was demonstrated between the 
development / clinical batches and process validation batches. 
The production bioreactor was evaluated in design of experiments (DOE). Process control ranges were 
determined based on characterisation studies for the production bioreactor and harvest steps. For the 
downstream process, risk evaluation was performed to determine the focus for the process characterization 
studies.

Characterisation 
Extensive characterisation of Zessly included primary structure, post-translational modifications, charge and 
size heterogeneity, higher order structure and biological activity.  The results demonstrate that Zessly has 
the expected structure and functional properties.  
Primary structure analysis confirmed the expected amino acid sequence. Disulfide bonds with the correct 
linkages were identified.  
The site of N-glycosylation was confirmed with G0F and G1F as the major N-linked glycans. Additional minor 
and trace-level N-linked glycans were identified. The relative abundances of the respective glycopeptides are 
consistent with the glycan mapping results.  
Low levels of oxidation, deamidation and succinimide intermediate formation were detected.  
Charge heterogeneity was investigated, with a main pI value of approximately 7.6. Additional peaks 
represent additional isoforms, the acidic variants and basic variants. Characterisation of the isolated main 
peak showed the predominant charge isoform corresponds to the 4-chain antibody with both H chains 
missing C-terminal lysine, and one H chain containing G0F and the other H chain containing either G0F or 
G1F N-linked glycans.  
Higher order structure was characterised using several analytical methods. The level of high molecular mass 
species (HMMS) including aggregates was analysed showing a predominant peak consistent with the 
monomer molecular mass, low levels of HMMS and trace levels of low molecular mass species (LMMS).  
Zessly is designed to bind to soluble TNF (sTNF) and membrane-bound TNF (mTNF) targets, resulting in a 
blockade of TNF effects. Functional cell-based assays and binding assays were developed to characterize 
Zessly. Biological activity was assessed by inhibition of sTNF-induced apoptosis in a cell based apoptosis 
assay. Inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner with activity compared to reference material. The 
FcγRIIIa reporter gene assay (RGA) was used to assess infliximab-induced FcγIIIa activation and signalling 
event. An FcRn binding assay was developed and applied to assess the binding to the FcRn receptor. 
Forced deamidation studies,  photodegradation studies and thermal degradation studies were also carried out 
as part of the characterisation.  
Levels of process-related impurities were tested during manufacture of full scale batches and satisfactory 
clearance was shown. 
Specification 
The drug substance specification includes test methods for appearance (clarity, coloration), pH, protein 
concentration, glycan profile, charge heterogeneity, identity, purity, product-related impurities, sterility, 
endotoxins, and biological activity.  
Analytical methods 
The proposed specification for Zessly has been provided with information on the analytical methods used for 
release and shelf life. Product-specific, non-compendial methods, have been used for assessing the protein 
concentration, glycan profile, charge heterogeneity, identity, purity, product-related impurities, and biological

activity. Some of the limits should be reviewed and revised based on further batch data (see 
“Recommendations for future quality development”).  
Compendial methods are used to determine appearance (clarity, coloration), pH, bioburden and endotoxin 
levels.  
Summary validation reports for non-compendial methods were provided. 
The purpose of the cell based potency assay is to measure the in vitro functional activity. The assay is based 
on the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-induced cell apoptosis by Zessly in a cell line that 
expresses TNFα receptors. The number of apoptotic cells in a population is proportional to the caspase-3 and 
caspase-7 activities. The functional activity of Zessly test samples is determined by comparison to Zessly 
reference material.  
Batch analysis 
Batch data was provided for several Zessly active substance batches manufactured at the commercial scale 
at Biberach site and used for non-clinical studies, clinical studies, stability and process validation studies. 
Batch analysis showed consistent production of active substance and all results were within the acceptance 
criteria.  
The initial strategy for setting the specification limits for release and shelf life of active substance was not 
accepted. Upon request, the specification limit strategy has been revised and the limits have been tightened. 
The specification limits are considered acceptable, however the Applicant should commit to re-evaluate some 
of the specifications once further experience has been gained (see “Recommendations for future quality 
development”). 
Reference Standards or Materials 
The existing Primary Reference Material and Working Reference Material have been suitably manufactured 
and characterised for their purpose. A protocol for qualification of future working reference materials has 
been  described, listing the methods to be used.  
All future working reference material lots will be calibrated against the primary reference material and the 
potency (by cell-based bioassay) with be monitored on a regular basis, to ensure that long-term drift or shift 
in relative potency of the released commercial materials is unlikely. 
Container closure system  
The information on the active substance container closure systems has been supplied. A review of available 
safety data of elemental impurities has been conducted in accordance with the ICH Guideline for Elemental 
Impurities Q3D. Compatibility with the active substance has been assessed. 
Stability 
Active substance stability has been demonstrated under long term conditions at the recommended conditions 
using clinical batches of active substance manufactured at the proposed commercial scale and site. The 
stability studies monitored the biological activity, protein concentration, purity, identity, appearance and 
general quality attributes, including stability-indicating methods.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 17/106 
  
  
Stability data obtained from accelerated storage temperature condition are also given in support of the shelf 
life claim and to support temporary excursions. In addition, active substance batches were stored at thermal 
stress conditions. 
A temperature cycling study was included. All data remained within the commercial acceptance criteria and 
no trends were noted in the active substance exposed to freeze/thaw cycles.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is presented as a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. It is supplied in a 
glass vial sealed with a stopper and an aluminium crimp protected by a plastic cap. The finished product 
contains no preservatives and is intended for single use. 
After reconstitution with 10mL sterile water for injections, the concentration of the finished product is 
10 mg/mL. The formula contains succinate buffer, sucrose and polysorbate 80. The reconstituted product is 
further diluted with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride for administration by intravenous infusion. 
Comparative information on the reference product is provided. The reference product, Remicade, is supplied 
as a 100mg lyophilisate in a 20 mL vial, and its excipients are listed as sucrose, polysorbate 80, monobasic 
sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate. There is a difference in the buffering system between 
Zessly and Remicade, but not in the theoretical strength of the reconstituted active substance, nor the nature 
of the stabilizer or the surfactant. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Critical quality attributes for Zessly have been identified. The attributes are as expected for a lyophilized 
monoclonal antibody. Data indicate that although the succinate buffering system selected is different from 
that of the reference medicinal product (phosphate), the formulation could be expected to provide adequate 
stability of the active substance. In the freeze-dried finished product vial, the formulation could be expected 
to provide adequate stability during storage when protected from light. The choice and concentration of 
excipients has been adequately justified from a safety and efficacy perspective. 
Process development has included a combination of small-scale studies with univariate and multivariate 
process parameter assessments, and commercial scale verifications. CPPs and non-CPPs are given. 
Container closure integrity is controlled. 
Data from assessment of robustness to process excursions have been provided and indicate that the 
formulated finished product is tolerant to the in-process conditions and to foreseeable excursions outside the 
normal operating ranges.  
Data on stability of reconstituted finished product and of reconstituted finished product diluted in saline for 
infusion has been provided to justify a hold of reconstituted finished product for up to 24 hours at 2 - 30°C 
and a hold of the infusion solution at minimum or maximum recommended dilutions for 24 hours at room 
temperature (≤30°C) with or without light exposure. 
A range of infusion preparation and administration contact materials have been stated as being compatible 
with the intended administration of Zessly. Additional data has been presented to support this claim.

Product specification 
The specifications include general tests (e.g. coloration, clarity, pH, osmolality, residual moisture, protein 
concentration, particulate matter, microbiology), and product-specific tests for identity, purity, content, 
charge heterogeneity, product related impurities and potency.  
The initial approach to setting release acceptance criteria for numerical attributes was not deemed suitable. 
Upon request the Applicant provided additional justifications and tightened the acceptance limits. In addition, 
the applicant commits to re-evaluate the specifications once more experience has been gained. (see 
“Recommendations for future quality development”).

Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data have been provided. The results were within specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process. 
Reference Materials 
See the active substance section. The same reference materials are used for the active substance and 
finished product. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life is 48 months when stored at the recommended temperature of 2 to 8°C and a single 
period of up to 6 months (but not exceeding the original expiration date) when stored up to a maximum 
temperature of 30°C. The shelf life claim is based on a stability program for both recommended and 
alternative temperatures.  
Stability data obtained from accelerated storage temperature condition are also presented in support of the 
shelf life claim, as well as data from thermal stress conditions and data covering thermal cycling. 
The finished product batches used for the stability studies were produced with the intended commercial 
process and packaged in glass vials, which are the same as the proposed commercial packaging. 
The stability data at 2 - 8°C and at 30 ± 2°C / 70 ± 10% RH indicate a stable finished product up to 48 
months.  
Data to support storage after reconstitution has been presented. 
Photostability of naked finished product vials was carried out in accordance with ICH Q1B (option two) and 
the commercial acceptance criteria were met. 
Biosimilar comparability exercise 
An extensive comparability exercise has been performed between Zessly and both EU-authorized Remicade 
and US-licensed Remicade. Data from a sufficient amount of US-licensed Remicade batches, EU-authorized

biological activity, N-linked glycans, charge heterogeneity, product purity, protein concentration, disulfide 
bonds, higher order structures and comparative forced degradation studies of Zessly, EU-authorized 
Remicade and US-licensed Remicade. Formulation differences between Zessly and the reference product were 
shown not to impact the analytical studies. Details of methods used in the characterisation and forced 
degradation studies, including method qualification or validation (as appropriate), are given. Methods applied

for the biological activity assays have been described in-depth and summaries of the qualification reports 
have been provided. 
Primary, secondary and tertiary structure analysis demonstrated that Zessly, EU-authorized Remicade and 
US-licensed Remicade were comparable. Purity analysis shows comparable profiles for the predominant 
monomer peak, with only low levels of HMMS. Product-related fragment species were slightly higher in 
Zessly, but this did not impact the bioactivity of Zessly compared to EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed 
Remicade. The mean protein concentration of Zessly is slightly higher than the mean value for EU-authorized 
Remicade, but there is no impact of this higher protein concentration of Zessly in vials in terms of the total 
dose used in clinical studies, compared with EU-authorized Remicade. 
The three major N-linked glycoforms are the same with similar proportions in all 3 products. The abundance 
of some minor/ trace glycoforms show differences, although further information has confirmed that these 
slight differences are unlikely to have any clinical impact. The levels of %total afucosylation were 
comparable. Slight differences between FcRn binding did not have an impact on PK and half-life.  
Complex biantennary structures containing alpha-Gal were only detected in the EU-authorized Remicade and 
US-licensed Remicade products; this is due to the use of different cell lines (SP2/0 for Remicade, compared 
with CHO cell line for Zessly). Zessly contains sialic acid as NeuAc, whereas EU-authorized Remicade and US-
licensed Remicade contain NeuGc. These minor differences did not appear to impact the in vitro biological 
activity assays.   
Differences in charge heterogeneity were observed, with higher %main and lower % basic species in Zessly 
compared to EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade. This was attributed to higher levels of C-
terminal lysine observed in infliximab products, which is not considered to be clinically relevant, since C-
terminal lysine is rapidly cleaved in vivo. Trace-levels of glycation were observed in all three products. Low 
levels of oxidation, deamidation and succinimide intermediate were detected in all 3 products. No differences 
were observed in the in vitro biological activity and therefore the differences in charge variants for Zessly 
compared to EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade are not considered to be clinically relevant. 
Zessly showed comparable binding and functional Fab domain activity to EU-authorized Remicade and US-
licensed Remicade, in several different assays. This included comparable binding of the Fab domain of the 
molecule to TNF (by SPR) and binding to cell surface TNF antigen. Comparable sTNF binding and blockade of 
sTNF resulting in inhibition of apoptosis were demonstrated, as well as comparable inhibition of TNF-induced 
endothelial adhesion molecule expression. GP1111 showed comparable binding to mTNF target antigen, 
which is important as the binding of infliximab to mTNF is a prerequisite for the potential Fc effector function 
activity. Additional details have been provided for the biological activity assays. 
In most cases, Zessly showed comparable binding and functional Fc domain activity to EU-authorized 
Remicade and US-licensed Remicade.  Any differences detected were appropriately justified with regard to 
their potential impact on efficacy and safety. 
ADCC effector function was shown to be comparable in several cell-based functional assays and binding 
assays, including a primary NK cell ADCC and an FcγRIIIa Reporter Gene assay. It is noted that Zessly 
results are at the lower end of the range in the FcγRIIIa Reporter Gene assay. Additional mixed lymphocyte 
reaction and NK cell binding assays showed comparability of biological function of the Fc domain. The CDC 
and C1q binding data showed similar results in the assays for Zessly, compared to EU-authorized Remicade 
and US-licensed Remicade.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 23/106 
  
  
Forced degradation studies supported the claim that Zessly, EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed 
Remicade are comparable, for lyophilised finished product or reconstituted product under conditions of 
thermal stress, photodegradation and forced deamidation. The degradation rate was higher in EU-authorized 
Remicade and US-licensed Remicade under thermal stress for reconstituted product, but this is likely to be 
due to the different formulations of the products. 
In conclusion, an extensive analytical comparability exercise has been conducted and demonstrates that 
Zessly is highly similar to the reference product Remicade. 
Adventitious agents 
The cell bank and routine controls to detect and prevent viral adventitious agents are typical for a monoclonal 
antibody. 
Viral clearance studies have been described and additional data have been provided showing the clearance 
values and cumulative log 10 reduction values for each model virus. This confirms the viral clearance capacity 
of the purification process (which includes viral inactivation and removal steps). 
Sufficient detail regarding the virus filtration model has been provided to complete an assessment that 
routine clearance can be reasonably assured.  
Assurance that the cleaning process reliably inactivates resistant non-enveloped virus has been provided. 
TSE issues 
No animal derived materials or excipients are used in the culture of MCB and WCB and in Zessly active 
substance and finished product manufacturing. 
Certificates of Compliance of Zessly MCB and WCB as well as confirmation of BSE/TSE Compliance of the 
Zessly active substance and finished product are provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results from tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
An extensive comparability exercise has been conducted, demonstrating high similarity with the reference 
product Remicade at the quality level. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
assurance on viral/TSE safety. 
Biosimilarity to the reference product has been satisfactorily demonstrated.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
• 
To re-evaluate specifications for active substance and finished product when further manufacturing 
experience has been gained. 
To implement testing for endotoxin for disodium succinate hexahydrate. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Several assays were performed to establish how the biological activity of the Fab domain of Zessly compared 
to that of the reference products, EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade.  The number of 
batches was considered adequate.  For the biosimilar, Zessly, on the basis of the endpoints provided, the 
binding kinetics profile for soluble TNF-α, binding to membrane-bound TNF-α, inhibition of apoptosis and 
inhibition of endothelial adhesion molecule expression were all shown to be similar to or within the range of 
that observed for both EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade. 
Studies were also performed to establish how the binding and biological activity of the Fc domain of Zessly 
compared to that of the reference products, EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade; the first 
series of studies examined some of the pathways involved in ADCC and CDC effector function. The assay 
formats used are listed below.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Binding to human Fc receptors (FcγRI, FcγRII, FcγRIII and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)) using surface 
plasmon resonance (SPR). 
Binding to C1q using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
Natural Killer (NK) cell binding assay 
The ability to initiate ADCC and CDC using suitable cell-based assays. 
These assays were developed to support comparability and are also summarized in the above sections.  
The number of batches evaluated in each assay was considered adequate. For the biosimilar Zessly the 
results were all shown to be similar to or within the range of that observed for both EU-authorized Remicade 
and US-licensed Remicade. 
The binding of an antibody to FcγRIIIa on effector cells is the first step (and thus plays an important role) in 
mediating ADCC activity; hence, the binding affinity and kinetics for Zessly vs. EU-authorized/US-licensed 
Remicade to two receptor types of FcγRIIIa were compared.  The FcγRIIIa (CD16) receptor is distributed on 
several cell types; however, there is ample evidence to suggest that natural killer (NK) cells expressing the 
CHMP assessment report

FcγRIIIa receptor are the major cell population which mediate ADCC activity. Hence, an in vitro assay 
utilising NK cells of multiple human donors with the same FcγRIIIa heterozygous genotype (effector cell) and 
target cells expressing mTNF was conducted and the ADCC activity for Zessly was compared to that of the 
reference products.  Given the challenges and inherent variability associated with the use of primary cells 
from multiple donors, the Applicant also used a more precise and reproducible method to measure ADCC 
pathway activation, though it is accepted that the assay does not directly detect target cell lysis.  This assay 
developed by Cheng and colleagues (2014) employed target cells stably expressing human membrane bound 
TNFα and effector cells stably transfected with FcγRIIIa  and a luciferase reporter gene.  The ability of 
infliximab to bind to mTNFα on the target cells and to FcγRIIIa on the effector cells result in the activation of 
the luciferase reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner. 
Minor variations in the FcγRIIIa SPR results for the individual test samples of Zessly, EU-authorized Remicade 
and US-licensed Remicade were apparent, when compared to that observed for the Zessly reference 
material.  However, the relative affinity  for FcγRIIIa(both receptor types), the absolute affinity for NK cells 
with FcγRIIIa (all three phenotypes), the relative ADCC activity as determined using primary NK cells 
(FcγRIIIa  heterozygous genotype) and the relative FcγRIIIa activation (via Reporter Gene Assay) afforded by 
the biosimilar, Zessly, were all shown to be similar to or within the range of that observed for both EU-
authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade. 
The binding of the Fc region of target-cell bound antibodies to C1q protein (complement) is the first step and 
thus plays an important role, in mediating CDC activity; hence, the binding of Zessly vs. EU-authorized/US-
licensed Remicade to C1q protein from human serum was compared.  In addition, the ability of the 
infliximabs to cause human-complement-mediated cell lysis (of cells expressing TNF-α) was compared.  The 
range of values reported for the relative binding to C1q and the relative CDC activity of the biosimilar, Zessly 
were all shown to be similar to that observed for both EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade. 
To further characterise Fc effector function, the affinity of Zessly to FcγRI, FcγRIIa(both receptor types), 
FcγRIIIb and FcRn was determined using SPR technology and compared to that observed with the reference 
products, EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade.  Literature results suggest that the affinity of 
IgG1 molecules to FcγRI  is relatively high; this was confirmed for infliximab.  The Applicant has 
demonstrated that the affinity of Zessly for FcγRI was comparable to EU-authorized/US-licensed Remicade. 
With respect to the affinities for FcγRIIa  (both receptor types) and FcγRIIIb, the affinities were said to be 
low, which is in line with data reported in the literature.  Reliable K D values could not be obtained for FcγRIIa 
131R or FcγRIIIb (as binding saturation was not achieved at the maximum concentration evaluated); 
however, for FcγRIIa 131H, the ranges for the relative KD values for Zessly, EU-authorized Remicade and US-
licensed Remicade were similar.  The Applicant has demonstrated that the affinity of Zessly for FcγRn is 
similar to that observed with the reference products.   
Other effector mechanisms of anti-TNFα treatments have been proposed that are independent of TNFα 
neutralizing activity apart from ADCC and CDC. A mechanism for inhibition of T cell proliferation has been 
proposed and is thought to occur via Fc-dependent, anti-TNF-induced generation of a population of 
macrophages with an immunosuppressive phenotype.  The Applicant has demonstrated that the observed 
inhibition of T-cell proliferation for Zessly is similar to that observed with EU-authorized/US-licensed 
Remicade.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The analytical methods used to determine serum levels of infliximab conformed to GLP, were validated over 
the range of 100 to 5000 ng/mL.  The Applicant has stated that all samples were analysed within the 
established stability criteria and suggested that EU-authorized Remicade was stable at -20°C and -70°C for 
up to 129 days, while Zessly was considered to be stable at -70°C for 72 days (see Section 2.3.6). 
Two separate electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassays were validated to detect the presence of anti-
drug antibodies (ADAs) in rat serum following administration of EU-authorized Remicade and administration 
of Zessly. 
Infliximab does not bind to TNF-α from any other non-clinical species to the same extent as that observed in 
humans, apart from the chimpanzee and hence the CHMP Scientific advice provided in November 2012 and 
July 2014 questioned the relevance of the conduct of in vivo studies in the rat, though there is evidence that 
suggests that the rat can be used to characterise FcRn mediated non-target related clearance [Roopenian & 
Akilesh, 2007; Abdiche et al., 2015].  It is acknowledged that the 2 in vivo studies to evaluate the TK (and 
tolerability) were performed at the request of another regulatory agency outside the EU and that the studies 
were designed in accordance with the 3Rs. 
Following a single IV dose at 10 or 50 mg/kg (n=5/group), the systemic exposures and the half-lives for 
Zessly were said to be comparable to those observed with EU-authorized Remicade.   
A 2-week study was conducted whereby Zessly was administered once weekly on Days 1, 8 and 15 at 10 or 
50 mg/kg in a non-comparative study to both male and female rats.  The systemic exposures increased in a 
manner that was approximately proportional to dose and exposures were slightly higher on repeated dosing 
(Day 8).  No ADAs were detected following single IV administration of Zessly or EU-authorized Remicade; 
however, the levels of infliximab in the samples may have affected the ADA determinations. 
No studies to evaluate the distribution, metabolism, excretion or potential to cause pharmacokinetic 
interactions were conducted, which is in line with Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing

guideline (R1) Preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals 
[EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
In the rat, single IV administration of Zessly or infliximab at 10 and 50 mg/kg was well tolerated, whereby no 
effects on clinical signs, body weight or food consumption were observed.  In a non-comparative, 2-week 
repeated-dose IV study, where rats were given Zessly once weekly at 0, 10 or 50 mg/kg on Days 1, 8, and 
15, a decrease in the levels of platelets and an increase in the levels of neutrophils, monocytes, unstained 
large cells and fibrinogen were observed at the maximum dose tested. Minimal to mild sinusoidal cell 
hyperplasia was also observed at 50 mg/kg.  However, the observed changes were considered not to be 
adverse given the magnitude of the changes (≤ 2-fold), the lack of a histological correlate and/or that similar 
findings have been noted during previous infliximab studies conducted in the rat. 
Genotoxicity 
It is not expected that IgGs would interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material; hence, 
genotoxicity studies have not been conducted in accordance with ICH S6 (R1): Preclinical safety evaluation of 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals [EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998]. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies are not required to develop the proposed biosimilar in accordance with Guideline on 
similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-
clinical and clinical issues [EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev.1 (Dec 2014)]. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies to investigate the potential to cause reproductive and developmental toxicity are not required in 
accordance with Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins 
as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues [EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev.1 (Dec 2014)]. 
Local Tolerance  
Separate local tolerance studies are not recommended in accordance with Guideline on similar biological 
medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical 
issues [EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev.1 (Dec 2014)].  Local tolerance was evaluated as part of the 
repeated-dose study.

Other toxicity studies 
Separate studies to evaluate the potential for antigenicity and immunotoxicity have not been performed. 
Separate studies to evaluate dependence and the effects of metabolites have not been performed.  The 
conduct of toxicity studies in non-relevant species (i.e. to assess unspecific toxicity only, based on impurities) 
is not recommended.  This is in keeping with the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues 
[EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev.1 (Dec 2014)] 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, a protein and therefore unlikely to pose a significant risk to the 
environment. This is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The majority of the binding and functional assays appeared to be sufficiently validated and clarification was 
sought where details of methods were not located.  Overall the in vitro assays utilised can be considered to 
be scientifically valid and sufficiently robust. 
The data as presented did not detect substantial differences between the batches of proposed infliximab 
biosimilar and the batches of the Remicade® sourced from the EU and US. It was noted by the CHMP that the 
majority of the comparisons had been made using relative potency values for e.g., where the mean endpoints 
for Zessly and EU-authorized/US-licensed Remicade have been compared to or expressed as a percentage of 
the result obtained for Zessly reference material.  The Applicant clarified the calculations used to determine 
the relative potency.  For a given test sample, it was expected that the readout would be expressed as a 
percentage of the result obtained with the reference material (i.e. test result/reference result * 100).  
However, the equations presented suggested the converse. The Applicant confirmed that potency of the 
standard was expressed as a percentage of the reference and thus, an inverse ratio was calculated.   
It was also the view of the CHMP that definitive conclusions with respect to similarity could not be made on 
the basis of relative endpoints alone.  Hence, the absolute data for all of the individual endpoints from the 
binding and functional assays (for Fab and Fc functions) were requested to allow assessment. All the absolute 
and relative raw data have been provided by the applicant.  
For the NK binding assay, the methods used have been based upon that of Iida and colleagues, 2009.  The 
Applicant provided full description of the methods used upon request and has outlined the relevant negative 
control groups included to help demonstrate that the binding of infliximab (Zessly or EU-authorized/US-
licensed Remicade) to NK cells was dependent upon FcγRIIIa. 
To further characterise Fc effector function, the affinity of Zessly to FcγRI, FcγRIIa (both receptor types), 
FcγRIIIb and FcRn was determined using SPR technology and compared to that observed with the reference 
products, EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade. It was concluded that the mean relative values 
between Zessly and EU-authorized/US-licensed Remicade were comparable and the relative binding ranges 
overlap between Zessly and EU-authorized/US-licensed Remicade.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 29/106 
  
  
A mechanism for inhibition of T cell proliferation has been proposed and is thought to occur via Fc-dependent, 
anti-TNF-induced generation of a population of macrophages with an immunosuppressive phenotype.  The 
Applicant has suggested that the observed inhibition of T-cell proliferation for Zessly is similar to that 
observed with EU-authorized/US-licensed Remicade.    Upon request, the applicant has described the 
methods used and in the instances where the methods differ from that of Vos et al (2011). The assay 
methods/conditions have been clearly justified.  In addition, the Applicant has clearly demonstrated that the 
observed inhibition of T-cell proliferation is dependent upon both the interaction between the antibody 
(infliximab) and mTNF and the presence of an Fc region.  As requested, the Applicant provided detailed data 
to support the claim that the remaining cells at 7 days represent T-cellsThe comprehensive biological assays 
and results discussed above were considered comparable between Zessly and originator products, therefore a 
reduced non-clinical in vivo program was considered adequate. 
After review of the amended validation report for the determination of Remicade and Zessly in rat serum by 
quantitative ELISA, it is noted that 2/3 of the Zessly samples at 250 ng/mL did not meet the acceptance 
criteria at the time point of 58 days (while the criteria for stability at the longer time point of 72 days were 
met).  The Applicant was asked to clarify this discrepancy with the method validation and discuss how this 
deviation at the 58-day time point impacts upon the integrity of the results.   While the Applicant confirmed 
that none of the samples at the low concentration of 250 ng/mL passed the acceptance criterion for recovery, 
the lowest concentrations observed in the single and repeat dose studies were all approximately > two-fold 
or higher than the tested 250 ng/mL stability validation sample. Given that long-term stability of higher 
concentrations of Zessly for 72 days at -70°C in rat serum has been demonstrated, it is agreed that that 
variability seen during long-term stability assessment at the 250 ng/mL concentration level is unlikely to 
have impacted the toxicokinetic results reported. For validation of the methods used to detect ADAs 
generated against EU-authorized Remicade, it is evident that the acceptance criteria for inter-assay precision 
was 25%; typically, this should be set at 20% [EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**].  In 
addition, anti-EU-authorized Remicade antibody was stable in rat serum for at least 4.25 hours at ambient 
temperature, while long-term stability does not appear to have been determined.  Moreover, the acceptance 
criteria for stability were only met for 4 freeze/thaw cycles while it failed for 1, 2 and 6 freeze thaw cycles. 
The Applicant confirmed that the samples of rat serum were analysed within the established criteria of the 
validated method.  Given that the long-term stability of anti-drug antibodies is well documented and that 
separate validations were conducted in human serum, it is agreed that determinations of anti-EU-authorized 
Remicade or anti-Zessly antibodies in human serum should not have been adversely impacted by the 
deficiencies observed when validating with rat serum. 
A tailored toxicology package was provided: A comparative single-dose tolerability study was conducted in 
male rats only because non-clinical data and clinical PK data do not provide evidence of sex-related 
differences.  A non-comparative 2-week study was conducted where Zessly was administered once weekly on 
Days 1, 8 and 15; the findings from this study were then compared to results from historical studies 
conducted with infliximab as reported during the initial registration of Remicade, or the infliximab biosimilar, 
Remsima.  Both toxicology studies were conducted in the SD rat and conformed to the principles GLP. The 
non-clinical batches used (drug substance batch 94200 and drug product batch A03038) were said to be 
representative of the clinical drug product and were manufactured using the final commercial manufacturing 
process.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant provided a comprehensive package of in vitro pharmacology studies and the nature of the 
studies used for functional characterisation of Zessly is in line with the CHMP Scientific advice received.  The 
pharmacology data generated during the binding and functional assays demonstrate that Zessly is similar to 
Remicade with respect to the function of the Fab and Fc domains. 
The pharmacokinetics package for this application consisted of TK analysis from 2 toxicity studies and 
analytical methods to support the determination of infliximab and the anti-drug antibodies.   
Overall, the approval of the proposed biosimilar can be supported with respect to the active substance non-
clinical aspects. .  In addition, the proposed excipients, succinate buffer, sucrose and polysorbate 80 
represent pharmaceutical excipients with an established safety profile and there are no issues which preclude 
their inclusion.

At the time of the initial submission study GP11-301 was on-going and data were presented up to the Week 
30 pre-dose assessments (TP1: data cut-off date of 08 March 2016). This included full primary efficacy 
endpoint data. Data up to week 54 (TP2) was submitted with the responses to the D120 list of questions. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK data have been generated in the two clinical trials submitted in this application: the pivotal PK study in 
healthy volunteers (GP11-101); and supportive data from the efficacy trial in patients with Rheumatoid 
arthritis (GP11-301). In addition, a non-comparative pilot study using infliximab-EU only was performed to 
provide an estimate of overall PK variability for sample size calculation in healthy subjects (referred as 
B5371004). The assessment of clinical pharmacokinetics focuses on studies GP11-101 and GP11-301. 
Analytical methods 
Analytical methods applied during the clinical development include: 
1.  methods for measuring human serum levels of the active substance of Zessly and the reference 
product, Remicade 
An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to quantitatively measure free (i.e. free and 
monovalently bound) concentrations of infliximab (US-licensed Remicade, EU-authorized Remicade and 
Zessly) in human serum. The validation of this assay is acceptable. 
2.  anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 32/106 
 
 
 
 
  
  
In-line with the CHMP ‘Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of biotechnology-derived therapeutic 
proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006)’, the immunogenicity testing strategy utilizes a combination of 
screening, confirmatory and neutralisation assays for determining anti-drug antibodies. 
Anti-drug antibody detection 
In study GP11-101 two ECL bridging immunogenicity assays were used for the detection of anti-US-licensed 
Remicade/anti-EU-authorized Remicade and anti-Zessly antibodies. As labelled US-licensed Remicade was 
used to assess clinical samples from Phase 1, a cross-validation study using EU-authorized Remicade to US-
licensed Remicade was performed to show equivalence of assays using labelled US/EU reference product. 
In the phase III study GP11-301, a single assay strategy was used: ECL bridging assay  using labelled 
Zessly. The assay used is the same as used for Zessly treated subjects in Phase I. The applicant’s justification 
for this strategy is that it is favourable to reduce the risk of possible different sensitivities using different 
assays for EU-authorized Remicade/US-licensed Remicade and Zessly. There are slight differences between 
the 2 assays including in sensitivity and cut-points so in principle a single assay approach would be 
appropriate as this would minimise variability between the RMP and Zessly. Based on the high cross-reactivity 
seen, the Zessly single assay is suitable for use.  
Neutralising antibody detection 
In study GP11-101 two cell-based assays were used. The same strategy as for the anti-Remicade ADA assay 
was used whereby the assay was designed starting with US-licensed Remicade and then cross-validation was 
undertaken with EU-authorized Remicade. 
As for the ADA assay strategy, for the Phase III study GP11-301 a single cell-based NAb assay strategy was 
employed using the anti-Zessly NAb assay. There was high concordance seen between the two assays for 
samples from all 3 treated groups.

Analysis of hs-CRP in human serum of RA patients 
The assay used to determine the concentration of hs-CRP in serum samples of patients in the clinical 
efficacy/safety study is a commercially available system (Siemens BNII Nepheometer). The validation report 
provided for this assay is satisfactory. 
Study GP11-101 
The pivotal PK study was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, single-dose, 3-arm, comparative PK 
study in healthy volunteers carried out in a clinical research unit in the United States of America. Subjects 
received a single dose of 10mg/kg infliximab intravenously over a period of not less than 2 hours using a 
calibrated infusion pump in the form of the test product (Zessly) or reference products (EU-sourced Remicade 
or US-sourced Remicade) as per the randomisation list. 
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected prior to first dose, 2 hours, 4 hours, 24 hours (Day 2), Days 3, 
4, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, and 85. Immunogenicity was tested at baseline, Day 57 and Day 85 post 
dose. 
The primary endpoints were Cmax, AUCT and AUCinf. Secondary endpoints were AUCextrap%, CL, Vss and t½. 
The PK analysis was performed in the per-protocol (PP) population based on the planned 8-week serum drug 
concentration-time data. The PP analysis set included all randomized subjects who received the full dose of 
the assigned study drug and who did not have major protocol deviations. Equivalence for the primary 
endpoint were determined if the 90% CI for the ratio of the adjusted geometric means of Zessly to EU 
sourced Remicade were within the acceptance interval of 80.0 – 125.0%. The statistical and pharmacokinetic 
assessment methods used are generally appropriate for non-compartmental analysis. No single subject 
treated with either Zessly or EU-authorized Remicade had an AUCextrap% >20% and therefore no exclusions 
for AUCinf was performed based on this criterion.  
Overall, 151 subjects were randomized to the 3 study treatment groups. Five subjects discontinued prior to 
any study treatment; the remaining 146 subjects received the study treatment as assigned. In addition, 27 
subjects (12, 5, and 10 subjects in the Zessly, EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade treatment 
groups respectively) discontinued from the study after receiving the study treatment. The PP population 
consisted of 41 (78.8%) subjects in the Zessly treatment group, 45 (90.0%) in the EU-authorized Remicade 
group and 44 (89.8%) in the US-licensed Remicade group.  
Sixteen subjects with incomplete profile were excluded from the PK statistical analysis. The applicant 
indicated that exclusion of 15 out of 16 subjects from analysis was based on the incomplete PK profiles as the 
excluded subjects discontinued treatment before day 29 and therefore the elimination phase was not well 
characterised based on infliximab long half-life of 14 days. The remaining one subject was excluded due to 
high ADA leading to persistent BLQ serum measurements from day 22 onwards, although it was not clear 
how ADA, first emerged on day 29, led to BLQ on day 22. For all the excluded 16 patients, it was acceptable 
to exclude analysing the PK parameters which depend on the elimination phase characterisation (e.g. half-
life, Cl, AUCinf) when the elimination was not well-characterised (e.g. when subjects were early withdrawn). 
Moreover, the applicant included those patients in the analysis of the PK parameters which are independent 
of the elimination phase (e.g. Cmax). The new analysis for the Cmax values was within the 90% CI margins of 
80.0 – 125.0%. As inclusion of the Cmax results from the excluded subjects was consistent with the previous 
analysis, this indicates that exclusion of other PK parameters from those subjects which depend on the 
elimination phase is unlikely to affect the overall study conclusions. A high proportion of subjects in the Test 
arm discontinued post treatment compared to the reference (EU) (12/49 vs 5/48) who discontinued because

of lack of willingness to participate in the study. No longer willing to participate was the main reason for 
subject discontinuation in the treated arm of Zessly. It is reassuring that no adverse events related to the 
IMP were reported in those subjects.  
Among 146 randomized and treated subjects, 130 of which were included for PK analysis (PP analysis set) 
their demographic data (sex, age, race, weight and BMI) were generally comparable among the 3 treatment 
groups.  
Results of the PK analysis 
The 3 study drugs (Zessly, EU-authorized Remicade, and US-licensed Remicade) exhibited a similar PK 
profile, which was characterized by a rapid increase of serum drug concentration during each infusion 
followed by a multi-phasic decline in drug concentrations after completion of the i.v. infusion.

The 90% CIs for the ratio of geometric mean of Zessly and EU (and US) sourced infliximab for the primary 
endpoints of Cmax , AUCT and AUCinf were within the acceptance interval of 80.0 – 125.0% and support 
biosimilarity in pharmacokinetics of Zessly with EU (and US) sourced infliximab. 
As the 90% CI did not cross unity for all 3 PK parameters, an investigation into this observation revealed a 
difference in drug (protein) content of the vial containing the lyophilisate evidenced by the differences in 
protein concentration of the reconstituted lyophilisate between the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade used 
in study GP11-101. The difference in protein concentration represents a difference in dose. Whilst not 
crossing unity does not preclude biosimilarity, the EMA guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence allows 
for content correction where a reference batch with an assay content differing less than 5% from test product 
cannot be found (Doc. Ref.: CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). The protein-content corrected 
analysis comprised approximately 100.00% comparability between Zessly and EU sourced infliximab with 
90% CIs ranging from 93% to 112% for Cmax , AUCT and AUCinf. 
Summary of statistical comparisons of primary pharmacokinetic parameters with protein-content correction 
(PP set) 
The other PK endpoints Cl, Vss and t1/2 appear to support biosimilarity. The geometric mean ratios and the 
90% CIs appeared to be within the acceptable range of 80.00% to 125.00% except for Vss which had the 
lower bound of 90% CI slightly below 80%. The results for the additional PK endpoints are generally in 
support for the biosimilarity of Zessly to EU-authorized Remicade  
Summary data for Tmax was submitted and both Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade had comparable median 
and range for Tmax.

Five subjects tested positive for ADA during the protocol-specified 8-week PK profiling period, and therefore, 
the impact of ADA response on the PK similarity assessment was expected to be limited. 
The rate of ADA response increased considerably from Days 57 to 85 for all 3 treatment groups, which was 
accompanied by a decrease in mean drug concentration from Day 57, when the mean drug concentrations 
ranged from 7.54 to 8.17 μg/mL to Day 85, when the mean drug concentrations ranged from 2.56 to 2.87 
μg/mL. Consistent with this observation, patients with low infliximab concentrations (<2.2 μg/mL) were 
shown to be likely to develop ADA against infliximab. 
Overall, lower immunogenicity was observed for Zessly (12%) in comparison to EU-authorized Remicade 
(29%) and US-licensed Remicade (22%). However, the impact of ADA on Cl during the clinical study GP11-
101 was limited due to the single-dose PK and the absence of previous exposure to infliximab in the study 
population. Therefore, the antibody responses were primary antibody responses.  
Study GP11-301 
Supportive PK data is provided from the Phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of Zessly and EU-
authorized Remicade in combination with methotrexate in male and female patients with moderately to 
severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate. This study was 
on-going when data up to Week 30 pre-dose assessments were presented. This study is described in the 
clinical efficacy section below. 
Blood samples for measurement of serum drug concentrations were collected immediately (within 4 hours) 
prior to dose administration at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 54, and 62; within 5 minutes prior to the end 
of infusion at Weeks 0 and 14; and anytime during study visits at Weeks 4 and 78 (EOT). 
Ctrough levels at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 14, 22 and 30, and Cmax levels at weeks 0 and 14 were observed directly 
from the data. 
All patients who were treated with Zessly or EU-authorized Remicade, and provided at least 1 post-dose drug 
concentration measurement were included in the analysis of PK. Of the 650 randomized patients, 323 
patients received Zessly and 326 patients received EU-authorized Remicade and were included in the analysis 
of PK.  
Overall, discontinuation from treatment and from the study during treatment period 1 was similar between 
treatment arms. A total of 43 (13.3%) patients in the Zessly arm and 40 (12.3%) patients in the EU-
authorized Remicade arm discontinued from treatment during treatment period 1, defined by the date of the 
CHMP assessment report

final infusion. Before Week 14, 23 (7.1%) and 13 (4.0%) patients in the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade 
arms, discontinued treatment. The majority of patients were female (80.3%) and white (77.5%). The mean 
(SD) age of all patients was 52.8 (13.1) years, and the mean (SD) BMI was 27.4 (6.7) kg/m2.

Immunogenicity results 
TP1 
Up to week 30, the proportion of patients with ADAs in the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade study arms 
was similar at each specific time point of measurement. Overall, 48.6% of patients in the Zessly arm and 
51.2% of patients in the EU-authorized Remicade arm were ADA-positive up to Week 30. Approximately 80% 
of all ADA-positive patients also tested positive for NAbs, and ADA/NAb results were balanced between 
treatment arms at all measured time points.

A similar proportion of patients with ADAs, similar onset times and respective titers of ADAs were observed 
for the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade arms. The proportions of patients with ADAs after dose escalation 
were also similar between treatment arms. The proportions of patients with NAbs in ADA-positive patients 
were similar between treatment arms.

The development of ADAs lead to lower average Ctrough and Cmax concentrations in ADA-positive patients for 
both Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade. The frequency of ADA and NAbs was generally slightly lower in the 
Zessly arm. 
Population PK modeling 
A population PK model based on one clinical study (GP11-301) was developed to describe the PK of Zessly 
and EU-authorized Remicade in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis. The objectives were to estimate the 
systemic clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V) of Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade, and evaluate 
potential covariates influencing the CL and V for these treatments. NONMEM (7.2.0) was used for all model 
estimations, Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN, 4.2.0) was used for stepwise covariate modeling (SCM) and R 
(3.0.2) and S-Plus (8.0) were used for visual predictive check (VPC), and nonparametric bootstrapping. 
All technical modelling aspects were appropriately described. The population PK model described the PK of 
Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade with a two-compartmental model with linear elimination from central 
compartment. The similarity between Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade were supported by final model 
parameter estimates which showed similar clearance, V1 and V2 estimates for Zessly and EU-authorized

Remicade. Taking into consideration that the population PK model is of low impact in supporting biosimilarity, 
it has not received close Regulatory scrutiny. However, the use of popPK approach to support PK similarity 
and to add to the totality of evidence is acceptable.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Infliximab is an IgG1 kappa antibody that binds, via the variable region complementarity determining regions 
(CDRs), to both sTNF and mTNF with high avidity. Infliximab binding of TNF appears to mediate anti-
inflammatory effects through multiple mechanisms of action. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The primary mechanism of action is binding of the Fab domain of infliximab to sTNF resulting in disruption of 
TNF ligand-receptor signaling and inhibition of TNF proinflammatory effects. This mechanism of action is 
applicable across all disease indications. However, binding of sTNF does not completely explain infliximab’s 
effectiveness in treating CD. Binding to mTNF appears to be of additional importance in the treatment of CD. 
Once infliximab is bound to mTNF there are several proposed mechanisms of action. The infliximab/mTNF 
complex on the TNF-producing cell can block the binding to TNFR1/2 on TNF-responsive cells, thereby 
inhibiting TNF-induced apoptosis. Another proposed mechanism of action involves binding of the Fab domain 
of infliximab to mTNF resulting in a “reverse signaling” and cell apoptosis of the TNF-producing cell. Where 
infliximab has bound to mTNF, it is also possible that a cytotoxic effect is produced via the fragment 
crystallizable (Fc) domain through either antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). 
These mechanisms of action may play a role in neutralization of inflammatory response resulting in the 
effective treatment of these disorders with anti-TNF antibody therapy, supporting the consistent role of 
ligand-receptor interaction and function across these chronic, inflammatory disorders. 
No direct pharmacodynamic effects can be attributed to anti-TNFs in patients. In the clinical efficacy and 
safety trial GP11-301 the only pharmacodynamic endpoint studied was CRP which is a marker of disease 
activity but does not have a clear relationship to therapeutic effect. 
Up to week 30, mean changes from baseline in hs-CRP were similar between the treatment arms in the ITT 
population, with the maximal decrease of 17.2 mg/L in the Zessly arm and 16.1 mg/L in the EU-authorized 
Remicade arm observed at Week 2. Mean hs-CRP level decreased by 12.2 mg/L in the Zessly arm and 12.4 
mg/L in the EU-authorized Remicade arm at Week 30 as compared to the baseline values. In the PP 
population hs-CRP levels were also similar between the 2 treatment arms at each study visit up to Week 30. 
Mean hs-CRP concentrations at Week 30 pre-dose were 13.0, 14.4 and 10.6 mg/L in the Zessly/Zessly, EU-
authorized Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade, and EU-authorized Remicade/Zessly groups, respectively, and 
minimally increased over TP2 to 13.5, 16.5 and 12.0 mg/L at Week 54. The mean changes from study 
baseline in hs-CRP concentrations were -12.7, -10.2 and -16.0 mg/L at Week 30 pre-dose, and -12.2, -6.9 
and -15.2 mg/L at Week 54 for the Zessly/Zessly, EU-authorized Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade, and EU-
authorized Remicade/Zessly groups, respectively

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
PK data have been generated in the two clinical trials submitted in this application: the pivotal PK study in 
healthy volunteers (GP11-101); and supportive data from the efficacy trial in patients with Rheumatoid 
arthritis (GP11-301).  
The assay format employed by the applicant for the measurement of infliximab and immunogenicity is 
acceptable. For study GP11-101, the use of a single dose parallel design is acceptable considering the long 
half-life of infliximab and the possible generation of immunogenicity. EU sourced infliximab was used for the 
PK comparative study and in the pivotal clinical efficacy/safety trial. The inclusion of a US arm in the PK 
comparative study for the purpose of FDA requirements is regarded as supportive. 
The eligibility criteria are acceptable for study GP11-101. The selection of healthy volunteers in the pivotal PK 
study is recommended as they represent the most sensitive and homogenous population for a comparative 
PK evaluation for this procedure. The use of a single dose of 10 mg/kg represents the highest possible 
suggested strength for patients to induce immunologic tolerance and minimize the impact of ADA was 
accepted by CHMP and is considered appropriate to show comparable PK profiles of the test and reference 
products. The objectives and primary PK endpoints are in-line with those recommended in the CHMP 
Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and clinical 
issues. The sample size calculation, randomisation and blinding procedures are appropriate. The collection of 
supportive PK data in patients is appropriate and in-line with the guidance in the CHMP biosimilar monoclonal 
antibody guideline (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
For study GP11-101, the methods used are generally appropriate for non-compartmental analysis.  
For study GP11-301, the population PK assessments and the statistical methods used are appropriate for 
summarising the PK data. 
For study GP11-101, The 90% CIs for the ratio of geometric mean of Zessly and EU (and US) sourced 
infliximab for the primary endpoints of Cmax , AUCT and AUCinf were within the acceptance interval of 80.0 – 
125.0% and support biosimilarity in pharmacokinetics of Zessly with EU (and US) sourced infliximab. As the 
90% CI did not cross unity for all 3 PK parameters, investigations revealed differences in protein content. 
While this does not preclude biosimilarity, EMA guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence allows for 
content correction where a reference batch with an assay content differing less than 5% from test product 
cannot be found (Doc. Ref.: CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). The protein-content corrected 
analysis comprised approximately 100.00% comparability between Zessly and EU sourced infliximab with 
90% CIs ranging from 93% to 112% for Cmax, AUCT and AUCinf. 
For study GP11-301, almost 100% of the ITT population were included in the PK subset population. The PK 
population is well balanced for Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade arms. Ctrough and Cmax concentrations were 
similar between the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade treatment groups from Week 0 to 30. The 
development of ADAs lead to lower average Ctrough and Cmax concentrations in ADA-positive patients for both 
Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade. Of note, the frequency of ADA was generally lower in the Zessly arm. 
Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody known to be immunogenic with consequences on its 
pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy. In study GP11-101, overall lower immunogenicity was observed for 
Zessly (12%) in comparison to EU-authorized Remicade (29%). However, the impact of ADA on Cl during the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 47/106 
  
  
clinical study GP11-101 was limited due to the single-dose PK and the absence of previous exposure to 
infliximab in the study population. Therefore, the antibody responses were primary antibody responses. 
In study GP11-301, up to week 54, the proportion of patients with ADAs and NAbs in the Zessly and EU-
authorized Remicade study arms was generally similar at each specific time point of measurement. The 
development of ADAs lead to lower average Ctrough and Cmax concentrations in ADA-positive patients for both 
Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade.  
A population PK model based on study GP11-301 was also developed to describe the pharmacokinetics of 
Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.  The 
model objectives, nature of data, missing and outlying data handling; and general modeling aspects were all 
appropriately described. The population PK model described the PK of Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade 
with a two-compartmental model with linear elimination from central compartment. The clearance and 
volume of distribution were estimated and the effect of number of covariates including ADA, sex and BWT. 
The similarity between Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade is proposed to be supported by final model 
parameter estimates which showed similar clearance (0.014 L/h vs 0.015 L/h for Zessly and EU-authorized 
Remicade, respectively), V1 (3.38 L/h vs 3.57 L/h for Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade, respectively) and 
V2 (1.70 L/h vs 1.65 L/h for Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade, respectively). 
Pharmacodynamics 
In the clinical efficacy and safety trial GP11-301 the only pharmacodynamic endpoint studied was CRP which 
is a marker of disease activity but does not have a clear relationship to therapeutic effect. Mean hs-CRP 
concentration decreased in response to both Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade and the mean change from 
baseline was similar between the treatment arms up to week 54. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From a PK perspective, it is considered that comparability between Zessly and Remicade has been shown. 
From a PD perspective, no direct pharmacodynamic effects can be attributed to anti-TNFs in patients. In the 
clinical efficacy and safety trial GP11-301 the only pharmacodynamic endpoint studied was CRP which is a 
marker of disease activity but does not have a clear relationship to therapeutic effect. Up to week 54, mean 
changes from baseline were similar between the treatment arms. 
The immunogenicity data from the single-dose study GP11-101 in healthy volunteers and the data up to 54 
weeks in the GP11-301 study in patients with RA support biosimilarity between Zessly and the reference 
product Remicade.

GP11-301: A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-Blind Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Zessly 
and Infliximab in Combination with Methotrexate in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active 
Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Have Had an Inadequate Response to Methotrexate. 
Methods 
The clinical development programme to show biosimilarity between Zessly and Remicade is based on a single 
confirmatory efficacy and safety study (Phase III) comparing the efficacy and safety of Zessly and EU-
authorized Remicade in combination with methotrexate in male and female patients with moderately to 
severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate (GP11-301). 
The study population (aged 18 years or older) with moderate to severely active RA with a diagnosis for at 
least 4 month duration and with an inadequate response to MTX was proposed based on the historical 
Remicade data, including the ATTRACT study.

Study Participants 
 Key inclusion criteria 
•  Male or female patients aged 18 years or older at the time of informed consent. 
•  Diagnosis of RA based on 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification 
criteria for RA for at least a 4-month duration. 
•  Met Class I, II or III of the ACR 1991 Revised Criteria for Global Functional Status in RA. 
•  Moderately to severely active RA disease as defined by the following criteria: 
-  ≥6 tender joints (of 68 assessed) and 
-  ≥6 swollen joints (of 66 assessed) and 
-  High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) ≥10 mg/L (≥1 mg/dL). 
•  Stable dose of oral or parenteral methotrexate of 10 to 25 mg/week. Patients who could not tolerate 
10 to 25 mg/week methotrexate could take a lower dose of as low as 7.5 mg/week. In geographic 
regions where specified by local guidance or standard of care, a stable dose of as low as 6 mg/week 
was allowed. Patients were required to receive methotrexate for at least 12 weeks and were on a 
stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. 
Main exclusion criteria 
•  History of recurrent inflammatory joint disease other than RA (e.g., post infectious arthritis, gout, 
etc.) or history of any other autoimmune rheumatic diseases (e.g., vasculopathies, 
spondyloarthropathies, etc.) other than Sjogren’s syndrome. 
• 
Evidence of untreated or inadequately treated latent, or inadequately treated or active infection with 
tuberculosis (TB). 
•  Any current or prior treatment with the following disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) 
within the relevant washout period. 
•  Current or prior treatment with infliximab or lymphocyte depleting therapies (e.g., rituximab, 
alemtuzumab). Prior exposure to biologic therapy for RA with the exception of up to 2 doses of one 
biologic therapy for RA, including anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies (other than 
infliximab). 
Treatments 
All patients began their study treatment with an induction period, followed by a maintenance period. 
• 
Induction Period: Intravenous infusion of Zessly or EU-authorized Remicade at a dose of 3 mg/kg on 
Weeks 0, 2, and 6. The dose remained consistent for all patients for a minimum of 3 doses (up to 
Week 14). 
•  Maintenance Period: Beginning at Week 14, patients started to receive maintenance Zessly or EU-
authorized Remicade infusions every 8 weeks. The dose was maintained at 3 mg/kg for patients who 
achieved a minimum clinical response (20% improvement from baseline in both tender [68] and 
swollen [66] joint counts) at Week 14 visit. Patients who failed to achieve a minimum clinical 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 50/106 
  
  
response received a one-time dose increase to 5 mg/kg per infusion every 8 weeks from scheduled 
Week 14 visit onwards. Patients who initially achieved a 20% or greater response at Week 14, but 
subsequently lost the response also received a one-time dose increase to 5 mg/kg per infusion every 
8 weeks from the time point of such a loss of efficacy response. 
Prior to infusion with study drug, pre-medications, including antihistamines, acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
and/or corticosteroids, could be administered at the investigator’s discretion. 
Stable background therapies of methotrexate and oral folic/folinic acid supplementation were required 
throughout the study. Patients were required to continue their stable dose of oral or parenteral methotrexate 
of 10 to 25 mg/week. Patients who could not tolerate 10 to 25 mg/week methotrexate were allowed to enrol 
with a dose as low as 7.5 mg/week. In geographic regions where specified by local guidance or standard of 
care, a stable dose of as low as 6 mg/week was allowed. Patients were also required to receive an adequate 
stable dose of oral folic acid or oral folinic acid (≥5 mg per week) for at least 21 days prior to first dose of 
study drug and continue on the regimen throughout the study treatment. 
Permitted concomitant medications for stable pain/other arthritis therapy included: 
•  Stable dose (starting 4 weeks before baseline) of oral corticosteroids, equivalent to ≤10 mg/day of 
prednisone. 
•  Stable dose (starting 4 weeks before baseline) of one NSAID at a dosage less than or equal to the 
maximum recommended dose in the product information; in addition a cardiovascular dose of aspirin 
(≤325 mg/day) is permitted. 
• 
Physical therapy and therapeutic exercise. 
•  Daily doses of opioids and acetaminophen/paracetamol that were required to be stable for at least 2 
weeks prior to first study dose and remain on a stable dose throughout the first 54 weeks of the 
study treatment course unless treatment adjustment was needed to protect a subject’s safety or 
required as rescue therapy.

To evaluate the individual ACR (American College of Rheumatology criteria) parameters of clinical

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving clinical response in accordance to 
the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria of 20% improvement (ACR20) at Week 14.  The trial 
was designed to show equivalence of the test and reference products if the 95% CI for the difference 
between treatments was entirely within -13.5% to +13.5% with the primary analysis in the ITT population 
(the PP population was used as a sensitivity analysis). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included categorical and continuous measures of clinical efficacy, including 
ACR20 (other than Week 14), ACR50, ACR70, change in DAS28-CRP, DAS remission (<2.6), EULAR 
(European League Against Rheumatism) response and ACR/EULAR remission, change from baseline in 
individual components of ACR response (including Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index [HAQ-
DI]).  
Sample size 
The planned sample size of 614 in a 1:1 ratio was calculated using the difference in ACR20 response rates 
between the 2 treatment arms. With the equivalence or symmetric margin of (-13.5%, 13.5%), assuming the 
expected difference of 0 in Week 14 ACR20 response rates between the 2 treatment arms (response rate = 
57.5% for both Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade), a total sample size of 614 patients (307 patients per 
arm) yields ≥85% power to demonstrate equivalence using a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Equivalence between the 2 treatment arms in this study could be declared if the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
observed difference in ACR20 response rates at Week 14 fell within the equivalence margin of (-13.5%, 
13.5%). The equivalence margin was derived using a meta-analysis of historical published data for infliximab 
in RA and was accepted by the EMA. The expected ACR20 response rate of 57.5% at Week 14 was 
determined based on a weighted-average across the historical studies. The sample size was calculated using 
the method provided in Chow, et al (2008). 
At the conclusion of the enrolment, 650 patients were randomized to study treatment. Under the original 
assumption of 57.5% ACR20 response rate for both Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade: with the symmetric 
equivalence margin criterion (similarity margin (-13.5%, 13.5%) and 95% 2-sided CI), the power was 87.1% 
for the total of 650 patients randomized (assuming 1:1 ratio). 
The sample size and power calculations were done for the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population. 
Randomisation 
Patients were initially randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Zessly or EU-authorized Remicade, prior to Day 1 
dosing using an automated web-based interactive response system (IWRS). Randomization was stratified by 
geographic region (North America and Western Europe/Japan/South Korea/Latin America/Rest of the world). 
A second randomization was blindly performed prior to dosing at Week 30. All patients initially randomized to 
EU-authorized Remicade were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio, with 50% of the patients in the EU-authorized 
Remicade arm switching to Zessly and the other 50% remaining on EU-authorized Remicade. All patients 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 52/106 
  
  
initially assigned Zessly remained blindly assigned to continue on Zessly. All patients began open label 
treatment with Zessly at Week 54. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study patients, investigators/site staff, and Sponsor’s personnel directly involved in the study conduct 
were blinded to the IWRS treatment assignments throughout the study conduct. 
Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade were supplied packaged as blinded supplies in which the external 
packaging (carton) for both products appeared identical and identified with a unique container number. 
Zessly or EU-authorized Remicade solutions for infusion were prepared by the site’s un-blinded pharmacists 
designated to participate in this study. Un-blinded pharmacists received study specific training on the 
obligations of the role and signed an agreement that would be maintained in the Site Master File. 
A limited number of Sponsor’s personnel were un-blinded to conduct the analyses up to Week 30 and to 
prepare for initial regulatory submission. The review and conduct of the study continued in a blinded manner 
by study team members that were blinded to all study data until all randomized patients completed the Week 
54 visit or at the end of TP2. The study site personnel, investigators, and study patients also continued to be 
blinded until the end of TP2. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analysis sets 
The ITT population (ITT) was defined as all patients who were randomized to study treatment. The ITT 
population was used as the primary analysis population. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population was defined as all patients who were randomized and received the study 
treatment as planned up to Week 14, and had no major protocol deviations. 
The PP population was used as the second population for analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints 
and for sensitivity analyses. The list of patients with major protocol deviations or less than 100% study 
treatment compliance to Week 14 was determined based on blinded data review prior to database release. 
Statistical tests 
The primary analysis of the study was conducted after all patients have completed Week 30 assessment. An 
additional follow-up analysis was performed after all patients completed the Week 54 assessments and 
include 1 year of immunogenicity data. Both analyses support regulatory submissions and are not intended to 
alter the conduct of the study. Therefore, the Type 1 error rate will not be affected. 
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy parameter was the clinical response according to the ACR definition of 20% 
improvement, ACR20. The proportion of patients achieving ACR20 response at Week 14 was analyzed by 
calculating a point estimate with 95% and 90% CIs for the difference between the 2 treatment arms. 
Two exact methods were used to calculate CIs for the difference in ACR20 response rate at Week 14 between 
the 2 treatment arms. One was the score statistic method based on Farrington-Manning score statistic, and 
the other was the unconditional approach, which eliminates nuisance parameters by maximizing the p-value 
over all possible values of the nuisance parameters. The CI calculated by the score statistic method was used 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 53/106 
  
  
for the inference of equivalence. The CIs for the primary efficacy endpoint calculated by the 2 methods were 
compared to each other for a sensitivity evaluation. The analyses were carried out using SAS® PROC FREQ 
(SAS/STAT® 9.3). Equivalence between the 2 arms would be declared if the 2-sided 95% CI fell within the 
symmetric equivalence margin (-13.5%, 13.5%); this approach was endorsed by EMA and PMDA. The FDA 
endorsed the alternative approach where equivalence would be declared if the 2-sided 90% CI fell within the 
asymmetric equivalence margin (-12%, 15%). 
The ITT was the primary analysis population for ACR20 at Week 14. The same analyses were repeated for the 
PP population. 
The primary analysis for ACR20 was performed with the missing data imputed using a non-responder 
imputation method. For sensitivity purposes further missing data handling rules were applied. 
To account for a stratification factor (region), a sensitivity analysis was performed on the primary endpoint, 
utilizing a binomial model (SAS PROC GENMOD with identity link function) with treatment arm as a fixed 
effect and geographic region as a covariate. The “identity link function” is an option in the model that allows 
the difference in ACR20 response rates between the 2 arms and its confidence interval to be estimated. This 
analysis used all observed data at Week 14 in the ITT and PP populations, and no imputation was applied for 
missing ACR20 data at Week 14 for this analysis. 
Descriptive statistics including number of patients (n), frequency and percentage (%) were presented for 
ACR20 response at Week 14 in both ITT and PP populations. 
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints 
No equivalence testing was performed on secondary endpoints. The primary analysis was, however, repeated 
for secondary endpoint ACR20 at Week 22 and Week 30. 
Descriptive statistics were presented for all secondary efficacy endpoints for the ITT population and also 
presented for ACR20 response rate, DAS28-CRP and hs-CRP for the PP population. Point estimates for the 
difference in ACR50 and ACR70 response rates between Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade at all protocol-
defined time points up to Week 30 were also summarized. 
In addition, ACR20 up to Week 30 was analysed using a generalized estimating equation model with 
randomized treatment arm and visit as fixed effects and geographic region as covariate. Summary included 
point estimate and 95% CIs for the differences in ACR20 response. 
Figures of changes from baseline value by visit were presented for some of the secondary efficacy endpoints 
including joint counts, DAS-CRP, hs-CRP, PAAP, PGA, PGAA and HAQ-DI in the ITT population. 
Handling of missing data 
Three imputation methods (non-responder imputation, all observed data with no imputation, and tipping 
point analysis based on multiple imputation) were selected to explore the potential impact of assumptions 
regarding missing data. 
Efficacy data collected after TP 1 (i.e. in TPs 2 and 3)  
This will be summarized and presented by treatment groups within each treatment period and cumulatively 
across periods. These efficacy data include ACR responses and other secondary efficacy endpoints. Data will 
be summarized only descriptive statistics, no treatment comparisons will be performed. There are three 
groups in TP2: i) Zessly in TPs 1 and 2, ii) EU-authorized Remicade in TP1 and Zessly in TP2 and iii) EU-
authorized Remicade in TPs 1 and 2. There is only one treatment group Zessly in TP3.

Equivalence was shown for the ACR20 at Week 14 for both the ITT and PP populations, with the confidence 
intervals being well contained within ± 13.5%, so the study met its primary endpoint and supports 
biosimilarity in efficacy between Zessly and Remicade. Furthermore, the 95% confidence intervals for the 
treatment differences in ACR response rates between the 2 treatment groups were less than +/- 10%, which 
is considered not clinically relevant. 
The results of the supportive and sensitivity analyses reflect those in the primary analysis and support the 
robustness of the primary efficacy analysis. The ACR20 response rates at week 14 in the primary analysis 
were similar to the applicant’s assumption (57.5%) determined based on a weighted average across 
historical studies. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 responses by visit 
Up to week 30 the ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 responses were generally similar at all study visits. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 60/106 
 
 
  
  
For each of the individual ACR components the mean baseline value, mean absolute value and change from 
baseline at each timepoint was generally similar between both treatment arms. With the exception of hs-CRP 
where the maximal effect was seen at week 2, the maximal effect was seen at week 30. 
DAS28-CRP response 
In both the ITT and PP populations, at each study visit, DAS28-CRP responses and changes from baseline 
were similar between the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade arms with the maximum effect being observed 
at Week 30 for both treatments. 
DAS remission 
The proportion of patients with DAS remission (DAS<2.6) was similar between the 2 treatment arms at each 
visit. In the ITT population, a total of 62 patients (19.1%) and 54 patients (16.6%) achieved DAS remission 
in the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade arms, respectively, at Week 30. 
European league against rheumatism (EULAR) response.  
The proportions of patients in each response category were similar between the 2 arms. In the ITT population 
a total of 101 patients (31.2%) and 94 patients (28.8%) achieved good EULAR response in the Zessly and 
EU-authorized Remicade arms, respectively, at Week 30. 
ACR/EULAR remission 
At each study visit, a similar proportion of patients reached ACR/EULAR remission in the Zessly and EU-
authorized Remicade arms, with a Week 30 response in 30 patients (9.3%) and 23 patients (7.1%), 
respectively in the ITT population.

Efficacy results in sub-populations 
ACR20 and DAS28-CRP response for eligible patients with dose escalation 
Taking into consideration the smaller numbers in the subgroups that received a dose increase, it is agreed 
that the ACR20 and DAS28-CRP response rates were similar at weeks 22 and 30 in both treatment groups in 
the 3mg/kg and 5mg/kg subgroups. 
Demographic and other characteristics (ACR20 response rate at week 14) 
Overall, no significant differences were observed in ACR20 response rates between the subgroups.

Six hundred and fifty patients were included in TP1 and 566 patients continued on to TP2, of who 89.4% 
completed TP2. The number of patients in TP2 who discontinued treatment/discontinued from the study was 
balanced across the 3 treatment arms. 
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics were similar between the 3 treatment groups in TP2. All baseline RA disease 
characteristics were generally similar between the three treatment groups in TP2 and the cumulative 
TP1+TP2 analysis. However, there were some numerical differences in the RA characteristics at the start of 
TP2 from the Week 30 value for the original EU-authorized Remicade arm. 
A one-time dose escalation for patients who had not experienced a minimal improvement was possible from 
Week 14 study visit onwards, with a dose increase to 5 mg/kg. Similar numbers of patients had a one-time 
dose escalation in TP1 (Zessly: 83 patients [25.6%], EU-authorized Remicade: 83 patients [25.5%]). In TP2 
one-time dose escalation occurred in the following: Zessly/Zessly: 22 patients [7.9%], EU-authorized 
Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade: 19 patients [13.3%], and EU-authorized Remicade/Zessly: 12 patients

The decreases from Week 30 pre-dose to Week 54 were comparable among the 3 treatment groups, and the 
differences between the treatment groups were all less than the minimal clinically important difference of 0.6 
for DAS28-CRP. 
DAS remission 
The percentage of patients who had achieved DAS remission at Week 30 pre-dose was 22.5%, 20.3% and 
17.5% in the Zessly/Zessly, EU-authorized Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade, and EU-authorized 
Remicade/Zessly treatment groups, respectively. The value increased over TP2 in all treatment groups to 
28.2%, 23.1% and 20.3% at Week 54.

Efficacy results in sub-populations 
ACR 20 and DAS28-CRP response for patients with dose escalation 
A total of 166 patients (25.5%) received an increased dose during TP1 with similar proportion between 2 
treatment arms: 83 patients (25.6%) in the Zessly arm and 83 patients (25.5%) in the EU-authorized 
Remicade arm.  
ACR20 response rate at Weeks 22 and 30 
Similar response rates at Week 22 were observed for patients between the Zessly and EU-authorized 
Remicade arms who continued on 3 mg/kg, and for patients who received 5 mg/kg at Week 14. For patients 
who were eligible and dose escalated first at Week 22, similar Week 30 response rates were observed 
between the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade arms. 
Descriptive summary of ACR20 response rate at Weeks 22 and 30 in study GP11-301 (ITT population

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development programme to show biosimilarity between Zessly and Remicade is based on a single 
Phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade in combination with 
methotrexate in male and female patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have 
had an inadequate response to methotrexate (GP11-301). 
A single pivotal Phase III equivalence trial comparing the test and reference product is considered adequate 
to support this biosimilar application. 
The design of the study including the choice of the indication (rheumatoid arthritis), the clinical setting 
(patients not adequately controlled with methotrexate), dose regimen, the primary endpoint (ACR20 at week 
14) and the equivalence margin (± 13.5%) are in line with the CHMP guidance and were endorsed in CHMP 
Scientific Advice. Indeed, this clinical model was considered sufficiently sensitive to enable the detection of 
differences between the two products. 
The study was conducted in 5 geographic regions: North America and Western Europe, Japan, Republic of 
Korea, Latin America, and Rest of the world. Only 15.5% of the enrolled patients were from the North 
America and Western Europe geographic region. However, within each region, enrolment in the 2 study arms 
was balanced as region was the stratification factor used at the randomization and this is acceptable for a 
biosimilar exercise, provided that similar results are shown across geographical regions. 
This study is on-going but data on the double-blind period of the study up to week 54 is complete. The final 
24 weeks of the study comprise an open-label period where all patients will receive Zessly. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In treatment period 1, baseline patient demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across 
the two treatment groups, as were prior and concomitant medications. The number of patients that were 
eligible in accordance with the protocol and received a one-time dose escalation at week 14 or 22 was similar 
between the two treatment groups. The number of patients during TP1 that discontinued from study 
treatment and that discontinued from the study was comparable across the two treatment arms. The number 
of patients that discontinued treatment/the study due to adverse events was low and balanced across the 2 
treatment arms. 
Of the 650 patients randomized in TP1, 566 patients continued on to TP2, of who 89.4% completed TP2. The 
number of patients in TP2 who discontinued treatment/discontinued from the study was balanced across the 
3 treatment arms. The demographic characteristics were similar between the 3 treatment groups in TP2. All 
baseline RA disease characteristics were generally similar between the three treatment groups in TP2 and the 
cumulative TP1+TP2 analysis. However, there were some numerical differences in the RA characteristics at 
the start of TP2 from the Week 30 value for the original EU-authorized Remicade arm. In TP2 one-time dose 
escalation occurred in the following: Zessly/Zessly: 22 patients [7.9%], EU-authorized Remicade/EU-
authorized Remicade: 19 patients [13.3%], and EU-authorized Remicade/Zessly: 12 patients [8.4%]). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 70/106 
 
  
  
Equivalence was shown for the ACR20 at Week 14 in both the ITT and PP populations, with the confidence 
intervals being well contained inside ± 13.5%, so the study met its primary endpoint and supports 
biosimilarity in efficacy between Zessly and Remicade. Furthermore the 95% confidence intervals for the 
treatment differences in ACR response rates between the 2 treatment groups were less than +/- 10% which 
is considered not clinically relevant. The ACR20 response rates at week 14 in the primary analysis were 
similar to the applicant’s assumption (57.5%) determined based on a weighted average across historical 
studies. The results of the supportive, sensitivity and sub-group analyses (including patients with dose 
escalation and by demographics including region) reflect those in the primary analysis and support the 
robustness of the primary efficacy analysis.  
Furthermore, the results of secondary endpoints, in particular ACR50, ACR70 and DAS28-CRP, were all 
consistent with the results of the primary endpoint and were similar between both treatment groups up to 
week 54. 
In-line with historical data on Remicade, in all treatment groups up to week 54, the response rates were 
higher in patients that were ADA negative compared to those that were ADA/NAb positive.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The single pivotal efficacy equivalence trial met its primary endpoint with the 95% confidence intervals of the 
treatment difference well contained within the equivalence margin. The robustness of this result is supported 
by the sensitivity, supportive and subgroup analyses, together with the results of the secondary endpoints up 
to week 54. 
These results demonstrate equivalence in clinical efficacy between the proposed biosimilar Zessly (Zessly) 
and the reference product Remicade (EU-authorized Remicade). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The comparative safety of Zessly was investigated in two studies: 
• 
• 
The PK study GP11-101 in healthy volunteers; 
The confirmatory efficacy and safety study GP11-301 in patients with RA.  
Safety data are presented by study. Due to the different objectives, design and populations in these 2 clinical 
studies, no combined or integrated analyses were planned or performed. In both studies, the safety 
population comprised all subjects/patients treated with at least 1 dose of study drug. 
For study GP11-301 data up to pre-dose week 30 comparing the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade 
treatment groups is presented (TP1). Data from week 30-54 comparing the Zessly/Zessly, EU-authorized 
Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade and EU-authorized Remicade/Zessly treatment groups is also presented, 
together with a combined analysis of TP1 and TP2 where appropriate/available. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 71/106 
 
  
  
Patient exposure 
In study GP11-101 146 subjects received a single IV dose of 10mg/kg infliximab: 49 subjects received 
Zessly, 48 received EU-sourced Remicade and 49 received US-sourced Remicade. 
In study GP11-301 patients received 3 mg/kg body weight administered IV at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed 
by a maintenance regimen of every 8 weeks, which is the approved dosing regimen for US-licensed Remicade 
in RA therapy. A one-time dose escalation for patients who had not experienced a minimal improvement was 
possible from Week 14 study visit onwards, with a dose increase to 5 mg/kg. 
TP1 
Drug exposure in study GP11-301 (TP1), safety population 
The administered total dose was similar between treatment arms: Zessly mean (SD) 1110.8 mg (389.52) 
and EU-authorized Remicade 1137.2 mg (377.16). Less than 5% of the total number of patients (14 [4.3%] 
patients on Zessly and 15 [4.6%] patients on EU-authorized Remicade) missed a dose and the main reason 
was due to AEs. The maximum number of missed doses was 3. There were no dose reductions due to AEs in 
either treatment arm. A total of 60 (18.5%) patients in the Zessly arm and 68 (20.9%) patients in the EU-
authorized Remicade arm had dose escalation to 5 mg/kg at Week 14. Twenty-three (23) (7.1%) in the 
Zessly arm and 15 (4.6%) patients in the EU-authorized Remicade arm had dose escalation to 5 mg/kg first 
at Week 22. 
The dosing instructions for Remicade vary depending on the indication and include dose escalation for 
patients with insufficient response or loss of clinical response. In patients with RA, studies with Remicade 
with doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg indicate a broad therapeutic window for infliximab with regards to the 
safety profile (Maini et al 1999, Westhovens et al 2006). Therefore, and also due to similar numbers of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 72/106 
 
 
  
  
patients with one-time dose escalation to 5mg/kg in TP1 in both treatment arms, no further safety subgroup 
analysis in patients with dose escalation has been undertaken. 
TP2 
Drug exposure in TP2, SAF 
In TP2 exposure to the IP is generally comparable across the three treatment groups. 
Adverse events 
Study GP11-101 
The number of subjects reporting TEAEs was 17 (34.7%) in the Zessly arm compared to 21 (43.8%) in the 
EU-authorized Remicade arm and 18 (36.7%) in the US-licensed Remicade arm. TEAEs were most commonly 
reported with PTs belonging to the SOCs nervous system disorders (6.1%, 6.3% and 8.2% respectively) as 
well as infections and infestations (6.1%, 4.2% and 0% respectively); the most common PTs within these 
SOCs were headache, and upper respiratory tract infection, reported for similar proportions of subjects in 
both treatment arms. 
Treatment-related AEs were reported for 5 subjects (10.2%) in the Zessly arm, 12 subjects (25.0%) in the 
EU-authorized Remicade arm and by 11 subjects (22.4%) in the US-licensed Remicade arm.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 73/106 
 
 
 
 
  
  
No Grade 4 or 5 TEAEs occurred in study GP11-101. Eight subjects had grade 3 AEs. The most common 
grade 3 TEAE was granulocytopenia, reported for 5 subjects (3.4%) overall: 3 subjects (6.3%) in the EU-
authorized Remicade arm and 2 subjects (4.1%) in the US-licensed Remicade arm. Two further grade 3 PTs 
were increased AST and myalgia, reported for 1 subject each (2.0%) in the US-licensed Remicade arm. 
Grade 3 mental disorder (not related to study drug) was reported for 1 subject (2.0%) in the Zessly arm. 
The overall safety profile appears generally comparable between treatment groups in study GP11-101. The 
number of AEs/subjects with AEs assessed as treatment-related was lower in the Zessly arm compared with 
the EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade arms, although it is acknowledged that the total 
numbers are small. 
Study GP11-301 
TP1 
As of 29 June 2016, 185 (57.3%) patients reported 486 TEAEs in the Zessly treatment arm and 176 (54%) 
patients reported 492 TEAEs in the EU-authorized Remicade treatment arm.

In-line with the known safety profile of infliximab, TEAEs were most commonly reported in the SOC 
‘infections and infestations’ with 86 (26.6%) patients in the Zessly arm and 72 (22.1%) patients in the EU-
authorized Remicade arm. 
Similar percentages of patients in both treatment arms had treatment-related TEAEs (Zessly: 81 patients 
[25.1%] and EU-authorized Remicade: 75 patients [23.0%]). Four patients (1.2%) in each treatment arm 
had treatment-related SAEs. Less than 5% of patients in each arm had treatment-related TEAEs of grade 3 or 
higher. The most common drug-related PTs were IRR with 17 (5.3%) TEAEs reported in the Zessly arm and 
20 (6.1%) in the EU-authorized Remicade arm; and increased ALT with 12 (3.7%) TEAEs reported in the 
Zessly arm and 8 (2.5%) in the EU-authorized Remicade arm, this is in-line with the overall most common 
PTs. Whilst a slightly higher number of treatment-related TEAEs were seen in the Zessly arm in the 
investigations SOC (23 [7.1%] vs 10 [3.1%]; with the exception of the AEs ‘ALT’, ‘AST’ and ‘lymphocyte 
morphology abnormal’ which were essentially balanced across the treatment arms, this slight imbalance 
came from single AEs per preferred term. 
Within the Zessly treatment arm, 33 (10.2%) and 3 (0.9%) patients reported TEAEs of Grade 3 and Grade 4-
5, respectively. In the EU-authorized Remicade arm, 30 (9.2%) and 6 (1.8%) patients reported TEAEs of 
Grade 3 and Grade 4-5, respectively. 
Within the Zessly treatment arm, 15 (4.6%) patients reported Grade 3 treatment-related TEAEs. No 
treatment-related TEAEs of Grade 4-5 were reported. In the EU-authorized Remicade arm, 12 (3.7%) and 3 
(0.9%) patients reported treatment-related TEAEs of Grade 3 and Grade 4-5, respectively. IRR was the only 
treatment-related TEAE of Grade 3 or higher that occurred in ≥1% of patients in any treatment arm. It was 
reported by 5 (1.5%) and 2 (0.6%) patients in the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade treatment arms, 
respectively.  
During TP1, the overall safety profile appears generally comparable between treatment groups in study 
GP11-301.

In TP2 similar proportions of patients experienced all causality TEAEs, treatment-related TEAEs: 
Zessly/Zessly 32 (11.4%), EU-authorized Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade 20 (14.0%) and EU-authorized 
Remicade/Zessly 16 (11.2%) and all causality TEAEs of grade 3 or higher: Zessly/Zessly 20 (7.1%), EU-
authorized Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade 11 (7.7%) and EU-authorized Remicade/Zessly 6 (4.2%) 
across the 3 treatment groups. 
In the TP1+TP2 analysis the number of all causality TEAEs was numerically slightly higher in the 
Zessly/Zessly group (67.5%) compared with the EU-authorized Remicade (59.4%) and EU-authorized 
Remicade/Zessly (63.6%) groups. However, the number of treatment-related TEAEs and all causality TEAEs 
of grade 3 or higher across the 3 treatment groups is generally balanced. The potential effect of the smaller 
size of the 2 infliximab arms (EU-authorized Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade and EU-authorized 
Remicade/Zessly) following re-randomisation at Week 30 also needs to be taken into consideration. 
During TP1 and TP2, the overall safety profile appears generally comparable between treatment groups in 
study GP11-301. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study GP11-101  
No deaths were reported. Two patients experienced an SAE: one unrelated case of ‘mental disorder’ in the 
Zessly treatment arm and one related case of ‘myalgia’ in the EU-infliximab arm. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 78/106 
 
  
  
Study GP11-301 
TP1 
Up to 29 June 2016, 4 deaths were reported, two in each treatment arm. One of the deaths in the EU-
authorized Remicade arm occurred outside of the TP1 data cut-off. None of the deaths were assessed by the 
sponsor or the investigator as treatment-related.  
The number of all-causality treatment-emergent SAEs was low, with 16 (5%) patients reporting SAEs in the 
Zessly arm and 20 (6.1%) in the EU-authorized Remicade arm, and generally comparable between the two 
treatment arms. In keeping with the known safety profile of infliximab, the SOC with the highest proportion 
of patients who had SAEs was ‘Infections and infestations’ with 6 (1.9%) patients in the Zessly group and 9 
(2.8%) patients in the EU-authorized Remicade group. Within the SAEs in this SOC, in the EU-authorized 
Remicade group one SAE ‘Community-acquired pneumonia’ was fatal; this death was assessed as not related 
to study treatment by the sponsor and investigator. 
In addition, there were 2 pregnancy cases reported during TP1 in the Zessly treatment arm that were 
considered significant AEs. In one case the outcome was the birth of a healthy male infant, in the other case 
the subject underwent induced abortion. No changes to the proposed information in section 4.6 of the SmPC 
are proposed or considered required based on these 2 pregnancy cases. 
TP2 
One death occurred in TP2 in the Zessly/Zessly treatment group. This was assessed by the investigator and 
sponsor as not related to the study drug. 
The number of all-causality treatment-emergent SAEs was low and generally comparable between the three 
treatment arms with 13 (4.6%) patients reporting SAEs in the Zessly/Zessly arm, 11 (7.7%) in the EU-
authorized Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade arm, and 4 (2.8%) in the EU-authorized Remicade/Zessly arm.  
Similarly, for the combined TP1+TP2 analysis the number of all-causality treatment-emergent SAEs was 
generally comparable between the three treatment arms. 
Adverse events of interest 
Study GP11-101 
Among AESIs, only infectious AEs were reported in this study. There were 6 (12.2%), 3 (6.3%) and 2 (4.1%) 
subjects in the Zessly, EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed Remicade treatment groups respectively, 
who experienced AEs under the SOC of “Infections and infestations”. Of these 3 (6.1%), 3 (6.3%) and no 
(0%) subjects respectively experienced treatment-related AEs. No tuberculosis or pneumonia cases were 
reported.  
Although more subjects experienced AEs under the SOC of “Infections and infestations” in the Zessly 
treatment group, all of these AEs were Grade 1. Two subjects experienced Grade 2 AEs; 1 in the EU-
authorized Remicade treatment group who experienced groin abscess (treatment-related), and 1 in the US-
licensed Remicade treatment group who experienced cellulitis (not treatment-related). 
Study GP11-301 
Infusion related reactions, infections (including TB and pneumonia), malignancy (including lymphoma) and 
hypersensitivity were identified as adverse events of special interest for infliximab. At the request of the

CHMP, taking into consideration section 4.4 of the Remicade SmPC and the identified risks in the RMP, the 
following were also included as AESI in the updated assessment of safety (up to week 54) submitted with the 
responses to the D120 LoQ: ‘Hepatobiliary events’, ‘SLE/lupus-like syndrome’, demyelinating disorders’, 
‘Heart failure’, ‘Haematological disorders’ and ‘delayed hypersensitivity (serum sickness)’. 
TP1 
Infusion-related reactions 
Low and similar proportions of patients in each treatment arm experienced an IRR: 19 (5.9%) in the Zessly 
arm and 21 (6.4%) in the EU-authorized Remicade arm. No patients experienced an SAE and the number of 
patients that discontinued treatment (6 [1.9%] Zessly vs 6 [1.8%] EU-authorized Remicade) or temporarily 
discontinued (7 [2.2%] Zessly vs 11 [3.4%] EU-authorized Remicade) due to AEs related to IRRs was similar 
across the 2 treatment groups. There were no dose reductions in either treatment arm due to IRRs. The 
majority of IRRs were attributed to study treatment by the investigator. 
IRR in ADA-positive patients 
Overall 157 (48.6%) of patients in the Zessly arm and 167 (51.2%) patients in the EU-authorized Remicade 
arm were ADA positive up to week 30. Less than 10% of patients had an IRR after testing positive for ADA 
and the rates were similar in each treatment arm (11 [7.0%] Zessly vs 14 [8.4%] EU-authorized Remicade). 
Infections 
There were no clinically meaningful differences between infectious AEs between the two treatment arms. 
All-causality treatment-emergent infectious AEs, safety population – TP1 
a. Includes 5 positive QuantiFERON®-TB test results under the investigations SOC 
During TP1 the number of patients with all-causality treatment-emergent infectious AEs was numerically 
slightly higher in the Zessly treatment arm (87 [26.9%]) compared with the EU-authorized Remicade group 
(73 [22.4%]). The number of patients with infectious SAEs was numerically slightly lower with 6 patients 
(1.9%) in the Zessly group and 9 (2.8%) in the EU-authorized Remicade group.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 80/106 
 
 
  
  
More patients in the EU-authorized Remicade group required the use of antimicrobial drugs, including 
parental (35 [47.9%]) and required hospitalization due to infectious AEs (10 [13.7%]) compared with the 
Zessly group (28 [32.2%] and 5 [5.7%] respectively). 
There were 6 cases of pneumonia reported, distributed equally between the 2 treatment arms. There were 2 
cases of tuberculosis; one case of latent TB in the Zessly group and one case of active TB in the EU-
authorized Remicade group. 
Malignancy and lymphoma-related AEs 
One grade 3 colon cancer was reported in each treatment arm. The investigator considered both cases not 
related to the study drug. One additional subject in the EU-authorized Remicade arm was diagnosed with a 
non-malignant lipoma. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the pattern of hypersensitivity reactions in the 2 treatment 
arms. 
All-causality treatment-emergent hypersensitivity AEs, safety population – TP1 
There were no dose reductions due to hypersensitivity AEs in either treatment arm. One subject from the EU-
authorized Remicade arm had a Grade 5 SAE of “shock multi-organ failure” captured using the 
hypersensitivity search criteria. The event was secondary to perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis and not 
due to hypersensitivity. 
Hypersensitivity AEs in ADA-positive patients 
A total of 11 (7.0%) and 19 (11.4%) patients reported 14 and 25 hypersensitivity AEs in the Zessly and EU-
authorized Remicade treatment arms, respectively. Three (1.9%) patients in the Zessly arm reported Grade 
3 AEs including cyanosis, blood pressure decreased, dyspnoea, hypotension and urticaria. Two (1.2%) 
patients in the EU-authorized Remicade arm reported Grade 3 rash and dyspnoea. No AEs of Grade 4-5 or 
SAEs were reported. Five patients each in the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade arms discontinued 
treatment due to hypersensitivity AEs; 3 (1.9%) and 2 (1.2%) patients, respectively, discontinued from the 
study. Two (1.3%) patients in the Zessly arm and 6 (3.6%) patients in EU-authorized Remicade arm

temporarily discontinued from the treatment. There were no dose reductions due to AEs in either treatment 
arm. 
In ADA positive patients, the number of patients with hypersensitivity reactions and the severity and 
seriousness of these was balanced across the 2 treatment groups. 
TP2 
In TP2 and the combined TP1+TP2 analysis, no clinically meaningful differences were seen in AESI between 
the three treatment groups.

Infusion-related reactions 
Although the overall number of IRRs was slightly higher in the EU-authorized Remicade/EU-authorized 
Remicade group compared with the Zessly/Zessly group, there were no clinically meaningful differences in 
the percentage of patients that had an IRR in each of the three treatment groups in TP2 or the combined 
TP1+2 analysis. 
Only a small fraction of the IRRs was grade 3 or 4 in either the ADA positive or negative groups. A low and 
comparable portion of patients among the 3 treatment groups discontinued treatment due to IRRs. 
Infectious AEs 
Whilst in the TP1+TP2 analysis there was a slight numerical imbalance between the groups, with the 
percentage of infectious AEs being numerically slightly higher in the Zessly/Zessly group, the vast majority of 
the AEs were grade 1-2 and the number of SAEs was very low and balanced between the groups. 
In TP2 the percentage of patients in the Zessly/Zessly group that required antimicrobials was numerically 
lower than in the other 2 treatment groups. Three patients in the EU-authorized Remicade/EU-authorized 
Remicade treatment group in TP2 were reported with treatment-emergent pneumonia. The number of 
patients with a negative quantiFERON®-TB test result at screening and reported with treatment-emergent 
latent TB in TP2 was very low and generally balanced across the treatment groups. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Although the overall number of hypersensitivity reactions was slightly higher in the EU-authorized 
Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade group compared with the Zessly/Zessly group, there were no clinically 
CHMP assessment report

Page 84/106 
 
  
  
meaningful differences in the percentage of patients that had a hypersensitivity reaction in each of the three 
treatment groups in TP2 or the combined TP1+2 analysis 
The number of hypersensitivity reactions that were grade 3 or above and the number of serious 
hypersensitivity reactions was very low and balanced across the groups. Similarly, the number of patients 
that required dose reduction/temporary or permanent discontinuation of treatment due to hypersensitivity 
reactions was low. 
The incidence and severity of hypersensitivity reactions across the treatment groups did not appear to be 
increased by ADA status. 
Congestive heart failure 
Up to week 54, 3 cases of heart failure were reported: 1 patient in the Zessly arm that later continued into 
the Zessly/Zessly group; 1 patient in the EU-authorized Remicade arm experienced a grade 1 TEAE of cardiac 
failure during TP1; and 1 patient in the EU-authorized Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade group experienced 
a grade 1 TEAE of heart failure during TP2. None of the events were considered related to study drug.  
SLE/lupus-like syndrome, Demyelinating disorders and Delayed hypersensitivity (serum sickness) 
No cases of any of these 3 AESI were reported during TP1 or TP2. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall the profile of laboratory parameters in study GP11-101 and GP11-301 was similar across the 
treatment groups. 
Impact of Anti-drug antibodies on safety 
In accordance with the Remicade SmPC, it is known that patients who developed antibodies to infliximab 
were more likely (approximately 2-3 fold) to develop IRRs. Use of concomitant immunosuppressant agents 
appeared to reduce the frequency of IRRs and development of ADA. In clinical studies, delayed 
hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. 
In study GP11-301, in-line with the known safety profile of infliximab, the percentage of patients that had 
IRRs was greater in the subjects that were ADA positive. The incidence and severity of hypersensitivity 
reactions across the treatment groups did not appear to be increased by ADA status. 
The impact of immunogenicity on safety was evaluated with respect to IRR and hypersensitivity. There were 
no treatment related differences on the effect of immunogenicity for IRR and hypersensitivity. 
Safety in special populations 
No studies in special populations were submitted. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In accordance with the EMA biosimilar guideline (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005), no further specific studies 
on the potential impact of drug interactions were submitted with Zessly.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study GP11-101 
This was a single dose study. There were no permanent discontinuations due to AEs. 
Study GP11-301 
TP1 
Permanent discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events 
Twenty-three (7.1%) and 24 (7.4%) patients from the Zessly and EU-authorized Remicade arms 
permanently discontinued treatment due to AEs, respectively; 16 (5.0%) and 14 (4.3%) patients, 
respectively, discontinued from the study. The SOCs with the highest proportion of patients who had AEs 
leading to permanent treatment discontinuations were Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (8 [2.5%] 
patients on Zessly and 7 [2.1%] patients on EU-authorized Remicade), Injury, Poisoning and Procedural 
Complications (6 [1.9%] patients on Zessly and 6 [1.8%] patients on EU-authorized Remicade) and 
Infections and Infestations (5 [1.5%] patients on Zessly and 6 [1.8%] patients on EU-authorized Remicade). 
Eleven SAEs led to permanent treatment discontinuation in TP1, 4 in the Zessly arm and 7 in the EU-
authorized Remicade arm. 
Temporary discontinuation due to adverse events 
During TP1, 31 (9.6%) patients in the Zessly arm and 28 (8.6%) patients in the EU-authorized Remicade arm 
temporarily discontinued due to TEAEs. The majority of the TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2, and resolved by the 
time of reporting. There were 7 SAEs that led to temporary treatment discontinuation during TP1, 3 in the 
Zessly arm and 4 in the EU-authorized Remicade arm 
During TP1 the incidence, type and severity of all-causality TEAEs that resulted in temporary or permanent 
treatment discontinuation, including patients that discontinued the study was essentially comparable between 
treatment arms. 
TP2 
Similar percentages of patients across treatment groups permanently discontinued treatment due to AEs 
(Zessly/Zessly: 14 patients [5.0%]; EU-authorized Remicade/EU-authorized Remicade: 10 patients [7.0%], 
EU-authorized Remicade/Zessly: 7 patients [4.9%]). The percentage of patients who discontinued from the 
study was also similar across groups (Zessly/Zessly: 12 patients [4.3%]; EU-authorized Remicade/EU-
authorized Remicade: 6 patients [4.2%], EU-authorized Remicade/Zessly: 5 patients [3.5%]) 
In keeping with the data from TP1, the number of patients across treatment groups that permanently 
discontinued treatment/discontinued from the study was similar in both the TP2 and TP1+TP2 analyses. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main safety data are derived from study GP11-301 in patients with Rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, 
safety data is provided from the phase I PK study in healthy volunteers which is considered supportive in 
characterising the short-term safety profile of Zessly. 
Overall, 49 healthy volunteers in study GP11-101 and 323 patients with RA in study GP11-301 were treated 
with at least one dose of Zessly. The extent of exposure to the IP is comparable for the Zessly and EU-
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 86/106 
  
  
Infliximab treatment groups.  
The overall safety profile as reflected by the most frequently reported TEAEs, severity of the TEAEs and 
number reported as related, appears similar between Zessly and Remicade and in line with that expected 
based on the EU-authorized Remicade SmPC. 
In study GP11-301, up to week 30 the most frequently affected SOCs were infections and infestations; 
gastrointestinal disorders; skin and subcutaneous disorders; and injury, poisoning, and procedural 
complications. The most frequently occurring TEAEs were IRR, ALT increased and nasopharyngitis. 
In study GP11-101, no deaths were reported. Two patients experienced an SAE: one unrelated case of 
‘mental disorder’ in the Zessly treatment arm and one related case of ‘myalgia’ in the EU-infliximab arm. 
Up to week 54, 5 deaths have been reported in study GP11-301, two in each treatment arm in TP1 and one 
in the Zessly/Zessly treatment arm in TP2. None of the deaths were assessed by the sponsor or the 
investigator as treatment-related. The number of all-causality treatment-emergent SAEs was low and 
generally comparable between the treatment arms.  
The overall incidence of TEAEs that affected IP administration in study GP11-301 was comparable in both 
treatment arms. The number of patients that experienced TEAEs that led to IP discontinuation, including 
patients that discontinued the study, was also comparable. 
In study GP11-301 IRRs, Infections (including tuberculosis and pneumonia), Malignancy (including 
lymphoma) and Hypersensitivity were identified by the applicant as TEAEs of special interest. At the request 
of the CHMP, the following were also included as AESI in the updated assessment of safety (up to week 54): 
‘Hepatobiliary events’, ‘SLE/lupus-like syndrome’, demyelinating disorders’, ‘Heart failure’, ‘Haematological 
disorders’ and ‘delayed hypersensitivity (serum sickness)’. There were no clinically meaningful differences in 
AESI between the treatment groups. 
In accordance with the known safety profile of infliximab, it is recognised that patients who develop 
antibodies to infliximab are more likely to develop IRRs. In study GP11-101, there were no AEs in any arm 
reasonably attributable to immunogenicity. In study GP11-301, over 54 weeks, the percentage of patients 
that had IRRs was balanced between treatment arms within the ADA positive subgroup. Only a small 
proportion of these IRRs were grade 3, 4 or serious and a low and comparable proportion of patients 
discontinued treatment due to IRRs. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on the data from study GP11-301 in patients up to week 54, together with supportive data from the 
single dose study in healthy volunteers, the overall safety and immunogenicity profile of Zessly is acceptable 
and supports biosimilarity between Zessly and Remicade (EU-authorized Remicade). 
2.6.3.  Extrapolation to the indications of the reference product 
Remicade has a number of indications in chronic inflammatory conditions in adults (RA, Crohn’s disease, UC, 
ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis) and children (Crohn’s disease and UC). In line with 
CHMP guidance (Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins 
as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues - EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1), extrapolation 
should be considered in the light of the totality of data, i.e. quality, non-clinical and clinical data. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 87/106 
  
  
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK profiles are well characterized and essentially similar across all indications for Remicade. 
Pharmacokinetics in adults 
Infliximab exhibits a dose proportional and linear PK profile over the studied dose range (1 – 20 mg/kg) and 
similar PK characteristics across RA, AS, PsA, PsO, CD and UC indications. 
PK data and Population PK analysis of Remicade collected in RA, AS, PsO, PsA, and adult and paediatric CD 
and UC indicate that the overall PK properties of Remicade across all approved indications are comparable. 
Population PK analyses of infliximab in various populations showed that clearance of infliximab was higher in 
patients who developed ADAs and influenced by body weight. In patients with RA receiving repeated 
infliximab dosing, concomitant administration of methotrexate resulted in higher serum infliximab 
concentrations at the low infliximab dose of 1 mg/kg, possibly by suppressing ADA formation and preventing 
its impact on infliximab PK. Similar findings have been generally reported in other indications, even though 
the extent of ADA formation, its response to concomitant immunosuppressants, and its impact on PK 
parameters may differ across indications. Accounting for those factors, the pharmacokinetics of infliximab is 
similar in patients with RA, PsO and CD. 
Based on all the above, it is reasonable to conclude that the PK of infliximab is linear and similar across 
disease indications in the tested dose range. 
Pharmacokinetics in paediatric population 
Infliximab PK characteristics (including peak and trough concentrations and terminal half-life) were similar in 
paediatric and adult patients with CD or UC following the administration of 5 mg/kg infliximab. Population PK 
analysis based on the data obtained in two Phase 3 studies comprising paediatric and adult patients showed 
that weight influenced the pharmacokinetics, however, age was not found to influence infliximab PK in age 
range tested (6-76 years). The effect of body weight on the PK of infliximab was corroborated in another 
population PK analysis conducted on data obtained from paediatric patients with a subgroup of patients aged 
6 years to 17 years showing mild decrease (20%) in steady state area under the concentration-time curve 
(AUC). The recommended dosing regimen of Remicade in USPI and SmPC in paediatric CD patients is 
generally consistent with that in adult patients, which further affirms PK similarity between paediatric and 
adult patients. 
Distribution 
The distribution/disposition of infliximab in humans is expected to be through the same mechanisms as other 
monoclonal antibodies.  These disposition mechanisms are expected to be shared by patients of the different 
licensed indications of infliximab. 
Conclusion 
These data suggest no major differences in infliximab PK across the indications of Remicade. A similar PK 
profile of Zessly and Remicade in healthy volunteers was demonstrated in study GP11-101 with supportive 
data in RA patients from study GP11-301. From a PK perspective, it is considered that equivalence is 
confirmed and sufficient data are available to support extrapolation, based on the totality of the data 
supporting similarity of Zessly and the reference product, to all indications of Remicade. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 88/106 
  
  
Efficacy 
The RA indication is considered a sensitive clinical model for the detection of potential differences in efficacy 
between a biosimilar candidate to Remicade and the reference product. Study GP11-301 met its primary 
endpoint and these results are supported by the sensitivity analyses and the secondary endpoint data up to 
week 54.  
From a PD perspective, extrapolation  to all other indications of Remicade, based on the totality of the data 
supporting similarity of Zessly and the reference product, especially those of inflammatory bowel diseases, 
depends on convincing evidence of the comparability of binding and effector functions, including those in the 
setting of membrane bound TNFα and is considered justified.  
Safety 
Remicade has a well-established safety profile in all approved indications based on the clinical trial experience 
in 4955 paediatric and adult patients and over 18 years of post-marketing experience. The important 
identified and potential risks for Remicade include infections, malignancies, heart failure and infusion 
reactions. The most common adverse events (>10%) include infections, infusion-related reactions, 
headache, and abdominal pain. Generally, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions observed were 
similar in Remicade-treated RA, AS, PsA, PsO, and CD patients. Overall, the adverse reactions reported in the 
paediatric UC trial and adult UC studies were generally consistent. Studies in paediatric patients receiving 
Remicade found a higher rate of infections, haematological disorders such as anaemia, leukopenia, and 
neutropenia, flushing, bone fracture and respiratory tract allergic reactions compared to those observed in 
adults with CD. 
Conclusion 
The overall pattern of safety events is generally consistent across the multiple approved clinical indications of 
Remicade and differences due to posology, patient population, indication, or patient factors are described in 
the prescribing information. The key safety concerns are common to all TNF inhibitors and reflect the primary 
MOA of Remicade (i.e., neutralization of the biological activity of TNF and the immunosuppressive effect). 
While potential qualitative or quantitative differences between the various indications are conceivable, those 
would be expected to result from unique disease specific factors, clinical and post-marketing exposure, and 
not from differences in the mechanistic effects of infliximab. 
Based on the data up to Week 54 from study GP11-301 in patients, together with supportive data from the 
single dose PK study in healthy volunteers, the overall safety profile is acceptable, supports biosimilarity and 
extrapolation to the other indications of Remicade based on the totality of the data supporting similarity of 
Zessly and the reference product is considered justified. 
Immunogenicity 
The rate of ADAs reported in literature varies from study to study according to the format, sensitivity and 
specificity of the assay, the cut-point used, or other factors such as dose or dosing regimen, concomitant 
medication and the underlying disease(s). 
There are differences between patient populations regarding the dose of infliximab (with the development of 
ADAs being inversely associated with infliximab dose), dosing regimen or the concomitant medications (e.g. 
immunosuppressive treatments). Inflammatory burden, thought to favour the production of ADAs, also 
differs among the disease populations. The effect of age on the ADAs has not been extensively studied. It has 
been reported that in patients with CD the prevalence of infliximab ADAs may be lower in children than adults 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 89/106 
  
  
(2.9% versus 11% in one of the studies), but community-based studies of paediatric and older populations 
find similar prevalence, suggesting that patient age may only play a limited role in anti-infliximab antibody 
production. 
From an efficacy perspective, infliximab ADAs may reduce treatment effects by two possible mechanisms: 1) 
neutralizing ADAs block binding of infliximab to its target, reducing treatment efficacy; 2) binding of both 
neutralizing and non-neutralizing ADAs to infliximab can result in the formation of immune complexes, which 
are then cleared from the circulation reducing the exposure to active drug contributing to changes in drug 
pharmacokinetics.  
Other important safety consequences of the development of ADAs are acute infusion reactions and delayed 
hypersensitivity. 
The clinical experience with Remicade is consistent with the above considerations. ADAs have been detected 
in studies with Remicade in different patient populations. The frequency of ADA formation reported in the 
Remicade SmPC is summarized in the table below: 
As expected, the antibody titers varied according to the patient population and the concomitant use of 
immunosuppressant therapies within specific indications. 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, it follows that immunogenic response to infliximab is not expected to be the same in all patient 
populations. However, considering the totality of the data supporting similarity of Zessly and the reference 
product, and, the comparable immunogenicity profiles in RA extrapolation to the other indications of 
Remicade.

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Zessly (infliximab) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it is a biologic product.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Zessly has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to Remicade. The European reference 
medicinal product is Remicade 100mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, MA numbers 
EU/1/99/116/001-005, MA holder Janssen Biologics B.V., NL, authorised 13 August 1999. 
The proposed clinical use of Zessly is identical to that of the reference medicinal product, Remicade. Zessly is 
proposed for the treatment of adult patients with Rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, Ulcerative colitis, 
ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis; and the treatment of paediatric patients with Crohn’s 
disease and Ulcerative colitis. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
This is a biosimilar application to Remicade. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical trial programme to show biosimilarity between Zessly and Remicade is based on two trials: 
•  Study GP11-101, Phase I PK study in healthy volunteers. 
•  Study GP11-301, Phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of Zessly and Remicade in 
combination with methotrexate in adult male and female patients with moderately to severely active 
rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
From a quality perspective, it is considered that high similarity between Zessly and Remicade was shown with 
regard to: 
• 
• 
primary, secondary and tertiary structures 
binding to sTNF and inhibition of sTNF response (apoptosis assay, inhibition of TNF-induced 
endothelial adhesion molecule expression) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 101/106 
  
  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
binding kinetics to TNF (sTNF and mTNF) 
glycosylation profile (only minor differences in the relative content of N-glycans) 
comparable total afucosylation and terminal galactosylation 
glycans of complex biantennary type, with low levels of high mannose glycans 
product purity  
HC + LC (slightly higher fragment content in Zessly, low levels overall)  
degradation profile (lower rate of degradation for Zessly after reconstitution, attributed to different 
buffer systems)  
There is a lack of alpha-Gal and NeuGc in Zessly (low levels in EU-authorized Remicade) which is considered 
favourable as these are potentially immunogenic. 
From a non-clinical perspective, the following endpoints for the proposed biosimilar, Zessly were all shown to 
be similar to or within the range of that observed for both EU-authorized Remicade and US-licensed 
Remicade: 
•  Relative affinity  for FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa (both receptor types) 
• 
(Absolute) affinity to NK cells with FcγRIIIa (all 3 phenotypes) 
•  Relative ADCC activity as determined using primary NK cells with the same FcγRIIIa heterozygous 
genotype  
•  Relative FcγRIIIa activation (as observed during a normal ADCC response) via reporter gene assay 
•  Relative binding to C1q and the relative CDC activity 
• 
(Absolute) inhibition of T-cell proliferation 
From a clinical perspective: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The pivotal PK trial in healthy volunteers showed comparable PK profile with 90% confidence intervals 
for the ratios of all 3 primary parameters (Cmax, AUCT and AUCinf) being well contained within the 
standard bioequivalence interval of 80% – 125%; 
PK data from the phase III clinical efficacy and safety study were also supportive of similarity. 
The pivotal efficacy trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis achieved its primary endpoint since the 
95% confidence interval for the difference in ACR20 was well-contained within the predefined 
equivalence margin (± 13.5%) in both the ITT and PP populations; 
The results of sensitivity and sub-group analysis of the primary endpoint data, together with the 
results of the secondary endpoints up to week 54 reflect those of the primary endpoint and support 
biosimilarity. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
From a quality perspective, some differences were observed between Zessly and Remicade: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 102/106 
  
  
• 
• 
• 
lower C-terminal lysine content in Zessly compared with infliximab; however, rapid cleavage of the C-
terminal lysine occurs in blood 
differences in the levels of minor and trace glycans 
trace levels VHS signal peptide and amidated proline in Zessly, not present in EU-authorized 
Remicade  
•  %main isoforms higher and % basic isoforms lower in Zessly (attributed to difference in C-terminal 
lysine levels) 
• 
• 
reduced FcRn binding for Zessly (some batches below EU-authorized Remicade range)  
protein content higher in Zessly than EU-authorized Remicade 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The type and incidence of ADRs to the test and reference products were broadly comparable and in line with 
those expected on the basis of the Remicade SmPC.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations about the unfavourable effects. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Data from the two clinical trials support PK, efficacy and safety similarity between Zessly and Remicade with 
both studies meeting their primary endpoints. The pivotal PK trial in healthy volunteers showed comparable 
PK profile with 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of all 3 primary parameters (Cmax, AUCT and AUCinf) 
being well contained within the standard bioequivalence interval of 80% – 125%; PK data from the phase III 
clinical efficacy and safety study in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis were also supportive of similarity. 
The single pivotal efficacy equivalence trial met its primary endpoint with the 95% confidence intervals of the 
treatment difference well contained within the equivalence margin. The robustness of this result is supported 
by the sensitivity, supportive and subgroup analyses, together with the results of the secondary endpoints up 
to week 54 
Based on the data from study GP11-301 in patients up to week 54, together with supportive data from the 
single dose study in healthy volunteers, the overall safety and immunogenicity profile of Zessly is acceptable 
and supports biosimilarity between Zessly and Remicade (EU-authorized Remicade).  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The clinical trial programme to show biosimilarity between Zessly and Remicade is based on two trials: Study 
GP11-101, a Phase I PK study in healthy volunteers and Study GP11-301, a Phase III study in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis.

Remicade has a number of indications in chronic inflammatory conditions in adults (RA, Crohn’s disease, UC, 
ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis) and children (Crohn’s disease and UC). In line with 
CHMP guidance (Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins 
as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues - EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1), extrapolation 
should be considered in the light of the totality of data, i.e. quality, non-clinical and clinical data. 
Extrapolation to the other indications of Remicade is justified based on the totality of the data supporting 
similarity of Zessly and the reference product including the pharmacokinetic and safety data which were 
generated in the PK study in healthy volunteers, and the PK, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity data which 
were generated in the confirmatory efficacy and safety study (phase III) in RA. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Zessly is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Zessly is favourable in the following indications: 
Rheumatoid arthritis  
Zessly, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the reduction of signs and symptoms as well as the 
improvement in physical function in:  
• 
adult patients with active disease when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs), including methotrexate, has been inadequate.  
• 
adult patients with severe, active and progressive disease not previously treated with methotrexate 
or other DMARDs.  
In these patient populations, a reduction in the rate of the progression of joint damage, as measured by X-
ray, has been demonstrated (see section 5.1).  
Adult Crohn’s disease  
Zessly is indicated for:  
• 
treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients who have not responded 
despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant; or who are 
intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.  
• 
treatment of fistulising, active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients who have not responded despite a 
full and adequate course of therapy with conventional treatment (including antibiotics, drainage and 
immunosuppressive therapy).  
Paediatric Crohn’s disease  
Zessly is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn’s disease, in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/223369/2018 
Page 104/106 
  
  
years, who have not responded to conventional therapy including a corticosteroid, an immunomodulator and 
primary nutrition therapy; or who are intolerant to or have contraindications for such therapies. Infliximab 
has been studied only in combination with conventional immunosuppressive therapy. 
Ulcerative colitis  
Zessly is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who have 
had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) 
or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.  
Paediatric ulcerative colitis  
Zessly is indicated for treatment of severely active ulcerative colitis, in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 
years, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-MP or 
AZA, or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.  
Ankylosing spondylitis  
Zessly is indicated for treatment of severe, active ankylosing spondylitis, in adult patients who have 
responded inadequately to conventional therapy.  
Psoriatic arthritis  
Zessly is indicated for treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when the 
response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate.  
Zessly should be administered  
• 
• 
in combination with methotrexate  
or alone in patients who show intolerance to methotrexate or for whom methotrexate is 
contraindicated  
Infliximab has been shown to improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the 
rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular 
symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1).  
Psoriasis  
Zessly is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who failed to 
respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including 
cyclosporine, methotrexate or PUVA (see section 5.1).

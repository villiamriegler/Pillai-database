2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-stranded ribonucleic acid viruses, named for the crown-like 
appearance of their spike glycoproteins on the virus envelope. They are a large family of viruses that 
cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV).  
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 8/133 
 
 
 
In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in clusters of patients in the city of 
Wuhan, China. A novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus – severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – was identified in these patients, and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 
infection was later designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2020) (Zhu, 2020). 
Most patients with mild cases of disease recover with symptomatic treatment and supportive care. 
However, approximately 15% of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with more severe illness frequently 
require hospitalization (WHO 2020). Approximately 5% of infected patients experience complications 
related to a severe form of interstitial pneumonia, which may progress to acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) and/or multi-organ failure and death (WHO 2020). 
Millions of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been confirmed worldwide, and the rapidly spreading, 
worldwide outbreak has prompted the WHO to declare COVID-19 a pandemic and public health 
emergency of international concern.  
The indication initially sought as part of this application was: 
COVID-19 
Kineret is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult patients with 
pneumonia who are at risk of developing severe respiratory failure (see section 5.1). 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
As of June 22, 2021, more than 178 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, including 
more than 3.8 million deaths. In the EU/EEA, over the month of April 2021, reported hospital and 
intensive care unit-admission rates for COVID-19 were approximately 175 000 and 25 000, 
respectively. The majority of patients with COVID-19 have little or no symptoms. Risk factors for more 
severe COVID-19 infections are among others advanced age and certain underlying medical co-
morbidities (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, obesity and immune 
compromised status). 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped RNA viruses and are important human and animal pathogens. Two 
coronaviruses have previously been identified as zoonotic infections which have adapted to humans 
and caused severe respiratory illnesses with high fatality: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) is a class I transmembrane envelope protein that forms a 
homo-trimer and mediates binding, fusion, and viral entry into host cells. The S protein is essential for 
virus infectivity and is the main target of the humoral immune response, as demonstrated by serology 
analysis of recovered COVID-19 patients (Long, 2020). The S protein mediates binding to the host 
receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting in membrane fusion and entry of the virus 
into susceptible cells (Hoffmann, 2020).  
Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily through person-to-person contact and respiratory 
droplet transmission (Lai, 2020) (Lewis, 2020). A high background rate of lateral transmission has 
been observed in households with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infected individual quarantining 
alongside other household members (Madewell, 2020). Compared to other betacoronavirus infections, 
the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., time before symptoms occur) has features that 
complicate the control of virus transmission: the period is highly variable (range 2 to 14 days) and it is 
often characterized by high viral loads and viral shedding (Ellington, 2020). 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 9/133 
 
 
 
 
Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
COVID-19 can be classified into 3 clinical stages. In stage 1, an estimated 80 % to 84 % of infected 
patients are slightly symptomatic. In stage 2a, patients have a non-hypoxemic pneumonia but can 
advance to a hypoxemic pneumonia in stage 2b or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 
stage 3 (8, 9). After 
9 to 10 days, 17 % to 20 % of patients can evolve toward more severe stages 
2b or 3, with increasing requirement for oxygen necessitating admission into an ICU with non-invasive 
or invasive MV (8, 9). At the more severe stages of COVID-19, mortality is reaching 60 % (10, 11), 
∼
and SRF from ARDS is the leading cause of death (12). By preventing the progression from LRTI and 
pneumonia to ARDS and SRF, the prognosis for patients with COVID-19 would be improved, lives 
would be saved, and the burden on global healthcare systems during the pandemic would be reduced. 
Several commercial detection assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen and serological assays for SARS-
CoV-2 specific antibodies are available on the market. 
Management 
Prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and clinical management of the disease are the 2 main 
strategies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Prevention with vaccines is expected to decrease the 
infection rate; however, emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants may constitute a threat, and the duration of 
protection following immunization is still unclear. Because of these uncertainties, an effective clinical 
management of the disease to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is of great importance. Since 
the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, immunomodulators were suggested as one of the main 
strategies to attenuate the exaggerated immune response of the host. Currently, a few medicinal 
products have been approved for the treatment of COVID-19 addressing different targets and various 
steps in the severity of the disease. Those are presented briefly below.  
Velkury (remdesivir, RDV), a broad spectrum anti-viral, was granted conditional approval by the EMA 
on 25 June 2020 and is indicated for use in adults and adolescents (from 12 years of age and weighing 
at least 40 kilograms) with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen or 
other non-invasive ventilation at the start of treatment).   
Regkirona (regdanvimab) is an antiviral, a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to 
the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike(s) protein of SARS-CoV-2 consequently blocking 
cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been granted a marketing authorisation on 12/11/2021 
for the treatment of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who do not require 
supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.  
Ronapreve (casirivimab / imdevimab) is a human IgG1 mAbs that bind simultaneously to the S protein 
receptor binding domain (RBD) and block its interaction with the host receptor, angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2). It has been granted a marketing authorisation on 12/11/2021 for the treatment of 
COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg who do not 
require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 and the 
prevention of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg. 
RoActemra (is an immunomodulating medicine (a medicine that changes the immune system activity). 
The active substance in RoActemra, tocilizumab, is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein designed 
to attach to a specific target (called an antigen) in the body. It has been authorised for the treatment 
of adults with COVID-19 who are receiving systemic treatment with corticosteroids and require 
supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 10/133 
 
 
 
EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) has issued advice (Article 5(3) procedure) on the use of 
Lagevrio (also known as molnupiravir or MK 4482) for the treatment of COVID-19 on 19/11/2021. The 
medicine, which is currently not authorised in the EU, can be used to treat adults with COVID-19 who 
do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. 
Lagevrio should be administered as soon as possible after diagnosis of COVID-19 and within 5 days of 
the start of symptoms. The medicine, which is available as capsules, should be taken twice a day for 5 
days. 
Systemic corticosteroids were not routinely recommended until emerging data from clinical trials, 
including the RECOVERY trial dexamethasone cohort (Horby et al. 2021), indicated a mortality benefit 
among patients requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. The EMA issued 
recommendations on the use of dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients on oxygen or mechanical 
ventilation (art 5(3) procedure 18 September 2020).  
Several other therapeutics are currently under evaluation in Europe. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Kineret (anakinra) is a recombinant human IL-1Ra that blocks the biological activity of cytokine IL-1 
(IL-1α and IL-1β) by competitively inhibiting its binding to the IL-1RI, thereby controlling active 
inflammation. Kineret has a short plasma half-life (4 to 6 hours) and is administered as a daily s.c. 
injection. The product is supplied as a 100 mg/0.67 mL solution in a single-use, prefilled syringe for 
s.c. injection.  
In the EU, Kineret is currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), all forms of 
cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), for Still’s disease (including systemic juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD)). Kineret is also approved for familial 
Mediterranean fever (FMF). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek formal CHMP scientific advice (SA) for this procedure. However, EMA COVID-ETF 
SA was initially sought by the principal investigator on the protocol design of the pivotal phase 3 SAVE-
MORE study supporting this extension of indication following which the protocol was amended. In 
addition, EMA COVID-ETF written advice was provided on the draft SAP for the SAVE-MORE study, and 
the SAP was thereafter amended according to the obtained feedback.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Anakinra (trade name Kineret) is a human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (r-metHuIL-1Ra) produced 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 11/133 
 
 
 
in an E. coli expression system by recombinant DNA technology. Anakinra is a 153 amino acid 
polypeptide with a molecular mass of 17.3 kilodaltons, and almost identical to the naturally occurring, 
non-glycosylated form of human IL-1Ra. Therefore, the MAH submitted a justification for not 
submitting ERA studies for anakinra, based on the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev1. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. The justification provided by the MAH for not submitting an ERA is considered to be 
acceptable based on the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev1.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No PK data were generated in the SAVE and SAVE-MORE studies (i.e., no quantification of anakinra). 
Further, anakinra was administered at the same dose (i.e. 100 mg) as for the other approved 
indications (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, RA) in the EU; therefore, there were no proposed changes to 
the product information in the clinical pharmacology section. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 12/133 
 
 
 
 
The PK profile of anakinra has been previously assessed in other patient populations (i.e. RA and Still’s 
disease) characterised by hyper-inflammation associated with elevated cytokines levels close to levels 
observed in severe COVID-19.  
With regards to interactions, treatment with anakinra might upregulate CYP450 enzymes that are 
suppressed by increased levels of cytokines. This is expected to be a problem for concomitant 
treatment with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic interval, however this is not 
considered to be the case for remdesivir which is co-administered with anakinra in some patients. 
Remdesivir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro and an inducer of CYP1A2 and 
potentially CYP3A in vitro. However, as anakinra is excreted renally, remdesivir is not considered to 
affect the exposure to anakinra during co-administration. 
The dosing in patients with renal impairment is extrapolated from previous studies with anakinra and 
in other patient populations. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Anakinra neutralises the biologic activity of interleukin 1α (IL 1α) and interleukin 1β (IL 1β) by 
competitively inhibiting their binding to interleukin 1 type I receptor (IL RI). Interleukin 1 (IL 1) is a 
pivotal pro-inflammatory cytokine mediating many cellular responses including those important in 
synovial inflammation. 
Primary pharmacology 
Severe COVID-19 is associated with high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines.  
IL-1α is constitutively synthesized as a precursor protein and is stored in epithelial cells, whereas 
monocytes and macrophages rely on de novo synthesis. The precursor form of IL-1α acts as a Danger-
associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule when released from cells undergoing pyroptosis. 
Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is commonly observed with 
cytopathic viruses. DAMPs and IL-1α stimulate production of IL-1β from monocytes and macrophages.  
Both IL-1α and IL-1β possess strong pro-inflammatory effects, and elevated levels of IL-1β have been 
reported during SARS-CoV-2 infection1. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly replicates in the epithelial cells of the 
lungs; cells are destroyed and release DAMPs, among which IL-1α plays a major role. It has been 
suggested that the progression from LRTI to SRF in COVID-19 depends on the early release of IL-1α 
from virally infected lung epithelial cells, which in turn stimulates further cytokine production including

Figure 1 Events during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the rationale for use of anakinra 
The rationale for treating patients at risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 with anakinra, is the 
pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection where epithelial damage leads to an autoinflammatory loop 
involving IL-1α and IL-1β release and recruitment of innate immune cells. Anakinra is a recombinant 
human IL-1 receptor antagonist that competes with IL-1α and IL-1β on the binding sites, blocking the 
biological activity of IL-1α and IL-1β, and thereby preventing tissue damage. It has been suggested 
that the progression from lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) to severe respiratory failure (SRF) in 
COVID-19 depends on the early release of IL-1α from virally infected lung epithelial cells, which in turn 
stimulates further cytokine production including IL-1β from alveolar macrophages. Anakinra blocks the 
biological activity of both IL-1α and IL-1β and has a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases 
including RA, CAPS, Still’s disease, and FMF, as well as in hyperinflammatory disorders. Considering 
the above information about COVID-19 immunopathology and anakinra mechanism of action, the MAH 
considered that a positive effect of anakinra in COVID-19 could be expected. The MAH also presented 
data from a preclinical study using mice challenged with human plasma either from healthy volunteers 
or from COVID-19 patients that supports the above described rationale.  
The risk of progression to SRF in COVID-19 patients was determined by blood levels of a soluble 
urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) of at least 6 ng per ml.

Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR):  
suPAR is the soluble counterpart of the uPAR receptor, which is anchored in the cell membrane of 
neutrophils and endothelial cells and is cleaved after the activation of the kalikrein system. Early suPAR 
increase is an indicator of the release of DAMPs like calprotectin (Renieris et al. 2021, Rodrigues et al. 
2021). Calprotectin stimulates the aberrant production of IL-1β by the circulating monocytes of 
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (Rodrigues et al. 2021). In an animal model of COVID-19, it was 
shown that knock-out of another DAMP, namely IL-1α, was protective for the host (Renieris et al. 
2021). These observations framed the hypothesis that early increase of suPAR may guide targeted 
therapeutics against IL-1α and IL-1β in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, in order to identify patients that 
would benefit from treatment with anakinra, the suPAR biomarker with cut-off ≥ 6 ng/ml was used as 
an inclusion criterion in the clinical studies (SAVE and SAVE-MORE) submitted to support this extension 
of indication in COVID-19. No other biomarker was initially considered in the enrichment of the 
population.  
According to the MAH, suPAR can be quickly measured with the CE-marked suPARnostic assays 
(ViroGates) using lateral-flow quick tests. The assay (suPARnostic Quick Triage kit) used for both 
SAVE-MORE and SAVE studies met all the essential requirements of Council Directive 98/79/EC as 
stated in the declaration of conformity submitted as part of this application. All assays for this test 
have been validated to ensure consistent measurements across the various platforms. Upon request 
from the CHMP, the MAH confirmed that the manufacturer of suPARnostic run validation programs for 
all 3 different assays according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute standards to ensure that 
they all fulfil requirements of repeatability and consistency as also required under the currently 
applicable Council Directive 98/79/EC for in vitro diagnostic medical devices.  
According to the MAH, suPAR was selected as an inclusion criterion based on studies showing that 
suPAR levels at hospital admission were associated with a risk of progressing into hyperinflammation 
and SRF in the context of COVID-19 pneumonia. These studies are briefly referenced below. In most of 
the studies presented, the ROC AUC was numerically higher for suPAR than for other biomarkers. It 
should be noticed that the cut-off values for suPAR and the patient populations differed between 
studies. Furthermore, the outcome in the prediction studies was not solely respiratory failure.  
• 
suPAR was initially proposed as a predictor of progression to SRF in COVID-19 by Rovina et al 
2020. Specifically, the authors reported that plasma suPAR levels ≥6 ng/mL at the time of 
hospital admission predicted progression to SRF (pO2/FiO2 <150 mm Hg requiring MV or 
continuous positive airway pressure) within 14 days in a cohort of 57 patients hospitalized with 
COVID-19 pneumonia, with airway pressure release ventilation (aPPV) of 86% and an negative 
pressure ventilator (NPV) of 92%. 
• 
In a prospective cohort of 187 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, suPAR and IL-6 
were found to be the blood biomarkers with the best performance to predict a 28-day 
composite outcome of non-invasive ventilation, intensive care admission, or death (Arnold et al 
2021). Simple clinical features alone such as age performed nearly as well as suPAR and IL-6. 
A cut-off of suPAR of 5.2 ng/ml was used. AUC ROC was 0.81, and the sensitivity and 
specificity were 0.82 and 0.65, respectively. The AUC for age was 0.70, and the sensitivity and 
specificity were 0.95 and 0.41, respectively. 
• 
In a prospective cohort of 403 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, the admission levels of 
plasma suPAR were found to have prognostic utility in predicting severe complications. The 
incidence of the primary endpoint, a composite outcome for the development of severe 
complications (including acute respiratory distress syndrome, ICU admission, or death from 
any cause), was 11.5% (95% CI:6.7to 16.3) in patients with suPAR levels >3.91ng/mL 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 15/133 
 
 
 
compared to 2.9% (95% CI:0.4to 5.5) in those with suPAR ≤3.91ng/mL. A competing risk 
analysis showed that for every increase of 1ng/mL in suPAR level at baseline, there is a 
corresponding increase of 58% in the hazard of experiencing COVID-19 complications (HR:1.6, 
95% CI:1.2 to 2.1, P=0.003). suPAR was significantly associated with incidence of severe 
COVID-19 complications (Oulhaj et al 2021). 
•  Napolitano et al 2021 published a single-center, prospective cohort study of 104 patients 
hospitalized for COVID-19 and proposed suPAR as a serum biomarker of clinical severity and 
outcome with a better performance compared to both IL-6 and CRP with the aim to optimize 
hospital resources. In patients with mild disease, suPAR levels were increased as compared to 
healthy controls, but they were dramatically higher in severely ill patients. suPAR levels were 
analyzed in a cohort of severe cases of COVID-19 on the first day of admission in ICU; the 
cohort showed a significant increase of suPAR levels (3870±1854 pg/mL) as compared to 
healthy controls (1680 ± 567 pg/mL) and patients with a mild form of COVID-19 (2836 ± 1102 
pg/mL). The data suggested that suPAR strongly correlated with the severity of the disease. 
The non-survivor group had higher levels of serum suPAR (4523 ± 1976 pg/mL). The ROC 
analysis indicated that the AUCs are much greater for serum suPAR (0.704; P<0.006) than for 
IL-6 (0.662; P<0.03). 
• 
In a large observational cohort study of 959 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, the prognostic 
value of suPAR in identifying patients with COVID-19 at risk of progressing to SRF was 
observed (ISIC cohort; Meloche et al 2021). In a multivariate analysis of severe inflammatory 
biomarkers, suPAR, IL-6, LDH, and procalcitonin were independently associated with the 
combined outcome of death/need for MV/dialysis; the AUC in predicting the outcome was the 
highest for suPAR (0.798, 95% CI: 0.749 to 0.830), followed by procalcitonin (0.750, 
95%CI:0.712to 0.784), LDH (0.714, 95% CI: 0.675to 0.749), and IL-6 (0.674, 95%CI:0.624to 
0.719).  
suPAR has also been investigated in other research projects, where it has been associated with 
morbidity and mortality in a number of acute and chronic diseases, and as such was considered, by the 
MAH, to be a prognostic marker of an inflammatory response and not a diagnostic marker for either 
COVID-19 or other diseases.  
The justification to use a suPAR cut-off of 6 ng/ml or more was based on available published evidence 
as well as on the conducted phase 2 SAVE study.  
As the suPAR test might not yet be broadly available in the EU, the MAH proposed to use an alternative 
score (i.e. the SCOPE score) using other biomarkers of inflammation that are well established. This is 
presented below.  
SCOPE score 
suPAR is a biomarker of early deterioration of patients which integrates information on 3 different 
functions (i.e. inflammatory cascade activation, coagulation, and endothelial-neutrophil interaction). 
These three functions are up-regulated in COVID-19, which explains why using biomarkers that only 
carry information for one of the functions cannot provide the integrated information as suPAR does. 
Moreover, the MAH considered that as the three functions are not equally affected in all COVID-19 
patients at the same time point; a set of biomarkers (SCOPE score) integrating the elements of all 
these three functions, could be used instead in the absence of suPAR. Therefore, in order to investigate 
more easily accessible biomarkers that would allow to identify COVID-19 patients that might benefit 
from treatment with anakinra, the use of the SCOPE score was proposed by the MAH. This score 
includes a combination of biomarkers of inflammation, coagulopathy and endothelial activation (CRP, 
ferritin, D-dimers, and IL-6) that have been measured in many of the patients involved in the SAVE-

MORE study and that, according to the MAH, could be used to obtain similar prognostic information as 
suPAR.  
Data on the SAVE-MORE population screened for inclusion (both patients with suPAR < 6 and suPAR ≥ 
6 ng / mL) was used to validate the proposed SCOPE score. Based on quartiles of CRP, ferritin, D-
dimers, and IL-6; each patient was assigned a score for each biomarker of 0, 1, 2 or 3 and a combined 
score between 0 and 12. The risk of progressing to SRF based on the new score was assessed by the 
MAH, and it was concluded that a score of 6 or more was associated with the same hazard of 
progression to SRF as suPAR ≥ 6 ng/ml. This was further elucidated by similar ROC curves. 
Both SCOPE and suPAR demonstrated a good performance in differentiating patients that have a higher 
probability of SRF or death. Nevertheless, the correlation between the suPAR and the SCOPE scores 
was further explored in the SAVE-MORE study upon request from the CHMP and a Spearman 
correlation of 0.39 was found. Further, in the current population that was studied, the two 
biomarkers/scores (suPAR and SCOPE) had only an overlap of 63% (404/639) of the included patients. 
In the SAVE study, in which an external validation was performed, the results were similar. Therefore, 
the SCOPE score does not identify the same patients at risk for progression to SRF as the suPAR does. 
The CHMP ultimately considered that this new screening tool (SCOPE score) was not a valid tool and 
thus cannot be used in the absence of suPAR to identify COVID-19 patients with pneumonia at risk of 
progressing to SRF. Upon request from the CHMP, the reference to SCOPE score initially included in 
SmPC section 5.1 was removed by the MAH.  
Overall, the proposed use of suPAR with cut-off ≥ 6 ng/ml to identify patients at risk of progressing to 
SRF was adequately justified by the MAH. Taking into account that a clinically relevant and statistically 
significant efficacy was demonstrated in those specific patients, the CHMP considered that the 
indication should be restricted to patients with suPAR ≥ 6 ng/ml in the absence of robust justification 
and clinical evidence supporting a broader indication (i.e. regardless of suPAR determination). Relevant 
information on the suPAR biomarker, including the specific test used as part of the studies, were 
introduced in SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1. See discussion on clinical efficacy.  
Considering the decisive role of suPAR for the identification of patients that are suitable for treatment 
with anakinra in COVID-19, the MAH should ensure that an appropriate and validated test that reliably 
allows the distinction between patients with suPAR < 6 ng/ml and patients with suPAR ≥ 6 ng/ml is 
available for all European patients. Such test should be adequately CE-marked as a companion 
diagnostic under the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation framework. 
Proposed dose 
The recommended dose of Kineret is 100 mg administered once a day by subcutaneous injection for 10 
days.

Not applicable.  
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No PK data were generated in the supportive phase 2 SAVE and single pivotal phase 3 SAVE-MORE 
studies, and no interaction studies were performed. The lack of PK data and interaction studies is 
overall considered acceptable by the CHMP, as it was already assessed as part of other approved 
indications and is not considered to be different in the newly proposed indication.

The recommended dose of Kineret is 100 mg administered once a day by subcutaneous injection for 10 
days in adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH clarified that 
the phase 2 SAVE study was considered as a dose finding study and together with data available for 
other anakinra indications was sufficient to inform the choice of the proposed dose. The data gathered 
from the  SAVE study are accepted to support the 10 days treatment schedule which differs from the 
other anakinra indications (e.g. RA).  
With regards to interactions, treatment with anakinra might upregulate CYP450 enzymes that are 
suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g. in patients with COVID-19). This is expected to be a 
problem for concomitant treatment with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic interval, 
however this is not considered to be the case for remdesivir which is co-administered with anakinra in 
some patients. Remdesivir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro and an inducer of 
CYP1A2 and potentially CYP3A in vitro. However, as anakinra is excreted renally, remdesivir is not 
considered to affect the exposure to anakinra during co-administration. 
Kineret is eliminated by glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular metabolism. As stated in the 
current SmPC for anakinra, dosing should be every other day in patients with severe renal impairment 
(CLcr < 30 ml/min) or end stage renal disease. Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH clarified the 
information regarding renal impairment was extrapolated from previous studies with anakinra and in 
other patient populations, which is considered reasonable. In line with other approved indications, a 
dosing adaptation should apply only to patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal 
disease at the time of anakinra treatment start due to COVID-19.  
In order to identify patients that would most benefit from treatment with anakinra in COVID-19 
pneumonia, suPAR, a biomarker of inflammation, was used in the inclusion criteria to select patients 
with risk of an unfavourable outcome of the COVID-19 infection. A suPAR level equal to or above 6 
ng/ml was required for COVID-19 patients to be included in both SAVE and SAVE-MORE studies. suPAR 
has been proposed as a prognostic marker of disease severity, not only in COVID-19 patients but also 
in acute medical patients. suPAR levels in healthy individuals are 2-3 ng/ml and may increase to 9-10 
ng/ml in critically ill patients. The hypothesis formulated by the MAH was that early treatment with 
anakinra guided by the suPAR biomarker may prevent progression to SRF in patients with COVID-19 
pneumonia. In addition, it was suggested that plasma concentrations of suPAR ≥6 ng/mL was an early 
predictor of SRF in those patients. Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH provided further evidence 
supporting the elevation of suPAR as a reliable prognostic marker for the development of complications 
in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who are not yet critically ill. Further, it was considered that in 
routine clinical practice and in clinical studies, blood biomarkers at the point of hospital admission have 
limited ability, in isolation, to predict poor outcomes from COVID-19, whilst some of the biomarkers of 
immune or inflammatory response activation, such as suPAR, were shown to have the best prognostic 
performance when used alongside clinical information (Arnold et al 2021). According to the MAH, 
suPAR levels are an indicator of a broad immune and inflammatory activation pathways and is believed 
to be detected earlier in the disease course and therefore identify a window of opportunity for 
intervention with anakinra in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The MAH also clarified that at the 
time the SAVE-MORE study was designed, the suPAR cut-off of ≥6 ng/ml was chosen based on the 
phase 2 SAVE study results and available published evidence. Subsequent evidence cumulated from 
prospective studies confirmed, according to the MAH, that suPAR is a reliable biomarker for early 
prognosis of risk for progressing to SRF in COVID-19. This is supported by CHMP. 
In addition, the MAH’s proposal to initially replace the use of suPAR ≥6 ng/mL with the SCOPE score in 
the absence of suPAR test was not endorsed by CHMP as suPAR and SCOPE did not identify the same 
population of patients at risk of progressing to SRF in COVID-19 pneumonia and efficacy was only 
demonstrated in patients with suPAR ≥6 ng/ml. Therefore, only suPAR with cut-off of ≥6 ng/ml is 
Assessment report

considered to be able to identify patients that may benefit from treatment with anakinra in COVID-19. 
See discussion on clinical efficacy for further information on restriction of indication to COVID-19 
patients with suPAR level ≥6 ng/ml.  
Considering the decisive role of suPAR for the identification of patients that are suitable for treatment 
with anakinra in COVID-19 pneumonia, the MAH should ensure that an appropriate and validated test 
that reliably allows the distinction between patients with suPAR < 6 ng/ml and patients with suPAR ≥ 6 
ng/ml is available for all European patients. Such test should be adequately CE-marked as a 
companion diagnostic under the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation framework.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, similar PK profile and similar drug-drug interaction is expected for anakinra in patients with 
COVID-19 pneumonia as in other patient populations previously investigated. The absence of PK data 
and interaction studies in patients with COVID-19 is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Evidence from SAVE-MORE and SAVE studies as well as from other published studies were provided to 
support the validity of the biomarker suPAR ≥ 6 ng/ml in predicting an adverse outcome (i.e. SRF) in 
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.  
In conclusion, based on the data submitted, the CHMP endorsed the proposed dosing regimen for 
treatment of COVID-19: a 100 mg dose administered once a day by subcutaneous injection for 10 
days.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted one pivotal study in support of the proposed indication and posology in COVID-19: 
the SAVE-MORE study, which is a pivotal, confirmatory, prospective, multicenter, double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled study in hospitalized patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-
2, LRTI and plasma suPAR levels ≥6 ng/ml. In support of the SAVE-MORE study, the MAH also 
submitted results from the ongoing open label single arm, prospective phase 2 SAVE study. In 
addition, the MAH provided references to other clinical studies in which anakinra has been used for the 
treatment of COVID-19, as requested by the CHMP.  
The database lock for the SAVE-MORE study occurred on August 18, 2021 and the final CSR is planned 
for completion in December 2021. The MAH committed to submit the final CSR as part of a type II 
variation by end of December 2021. In addition, the CHMP recommended the MAH to provide the final 
CSR of the phase 2 SAVE study, once available.  
The therapeutic indication initially proposed by the MAH was as follows: 
Kineret is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult patients with 
pneumonia who are at risk of developing severe respiratory failure (see section 5.1). 
The final therapeutic indication granted by the CHMP was restricted as follows:  
Kineret is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult patients with 
pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to 
severe respiratory failure determined by plasma concentration of soluble urokinase plasminogen 
activator receptor (suPAR) ≥ 6 ng/ml (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
The indication is further discussed in the below discussion on clinical efficacy section.  
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 19/133 
 
 
 
The recommended dose of Kineret in adult patients with COVID-19 is 100 mg administered once a day 
by subcutaneous injection for 10 days. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response studies were performed in subjects with COVID-19, which is considered acceptable 
by the CHMP.  
The dose proposed by the MAH (i.e. 100 mg q.d. administered s.c. for 10 days) was chosen based on 
the results of the proof-of-concept phase 2 SAVE study. This daily dose is similar to the dose described 
in the SmPC of anakinra for other currently approved indications (e.g. RA).  
2.4.2.  Main study 
SAVE-MORE: suPAR-guided Anakinra Treatment for Validation of the Risk and Early

•  Treatment Arm 1: patients received placebo+SoC. Placebo (0.67 mL of 0.9 % NaCl) was 
injected s.c. once daily for 10 days.  
•  Treatment Arm 2: patients received anakinra+SoC. Anakinra was injected s.c. as 100 mg once 
daily for 10 days.  
The medicinal product was administered on the same time ±2 hours every day. In case the patient 
was discharged (sent home) alive before the completion of 10 days of treatment, treatment was 
stopped prematurely. It was explicitly stated that the minimum number of days of treatment was 7.

Standard-of-care (SoC) 
The SoC options were decided by taking the following into consideration: the current algorithm for the 
management of COVID-19 by the WHO; the current algorithm for the management of COVID-19 by 
the NIH; and the WHO suggestion for remdesivir. 
The SoC for patients enrolled in the SAVE-MORE study included the following: 
For patients not in need of oxygen support with moderate illness.  
•  Regular monitoring of vital signs, including pulse oximetry.  
•  Anticoagulant prophylaxis was as follows: Patients who were receiving anticoagulant or 
antiplatelet therapies for other underlying conditions had to continue these medications. For 
the other patients, pharmacological prophylaxis, such as low molecular weight heparin, should 
be used according to local standards to prevent venous thromboembolism, when not 
contraindicated.  
•  Remdesivir treatment was reserved at the discretion of the treating physicians.  
For patients in need of oxygen support with severe illness.  
• Immediate implementation of oxygen support.  
• Application of positioning and airway clearance management, as needed, per the discretion of the 
treating physicians.  
• Regular monitoring of vital signs, including pulse oximetry.  
• Regular monitoring for signs or symptoms suggestive of venous or arterial thromboembolism, such 
as stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or acute coronary syndrome. Further 
diagnosis (e.g., laboratory tests and/or imaging) and management was done according to hospital 
protocols.  
• Cautious treatment with i.v. fluids.  
• Dexamethasone 6 mg i.v. or orally for up to 10 days or until hospital discharge, whichever came 
first.  
• Anticoagulant prophylaxis was as follows: Patients who were receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet 
therapies for other underlying conditions had to continue these medications. For the other patients, 
pharmacological prophylaxis, such as low molecular weight heparin to be used according to local 
standards to prevent venous thromboembolism, when not contraindicated.  
• Remdesivir treatment was reserved at the discretion of the treating physicians.  
There  were  protocol  deviations  in  a  considerable  number  of  patients,  with  higher  frequency  in  the 
placebo  arm  and  mainly  regarding  the  corticosteroid  regimen  used.  It  is  not  expected  that  these 
deviations have affected the effect of anakinra substantially. 
The MAH stated that the recruitment period was only three months and that there were no relevant 
changes in SOC or temporal trends in the prescription of remdesivir as SOC. The MAH also provided 
univariate and multivariate analyses for the primary endpoint including treatment with remdesivir as 
a covariate. The data provided did not support any modification of anakinra effect by remdesivir use.

Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy of early start of anakinra guided by suPAR in patients with LRTI by SARS-CoV-
2 in improving the clinical state of COVID-19 over 28 days as measured by the ordinal scale of the 11-
point WHO-CPS. 
Secondary objectives: 
-Clinical efficacy of anakinra treatment guided by suPAR in patients with LRTI by SARS-CoV-2. This 
was assessed by i) the changes of the ordinal scale of the 11-point WHO-CPS at Days 14 and 28 from 
baseline Day 1; ii) the changes of the SOFA score at Days 7 and 14 from baseline Day 1; iii) the 
duration of hospital and ICU stay; and iv) the association of clinical efficacy with the time of start of 
anakinra from the onset of COVID-19.  
-Effect of anakinra treatment guided by suPAR on biomarkers in patients with LRTI by SARS-CoV-2. 
This was assessed by the changes over time in CRP, IL-6, suPAR, ferritin, D-dimers, viral load, blood 
transcriptomics, and plasma proteomics.  
-Safety of anakinra in COVID-19. This was assessed by Day 28 and was further followed up long-term 
(Days 60 and 90).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
For clinical research, common outcome measures of COVID-19 were developed by the WHO, the 
International Forum for Acute Care Trialists, and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and 
Emerging Infections Consortium to serve as a minimum set of outcome measures for studies on 
COVID-19. Investigators in the clinical research community have been urged, by the WHO Working 
Group, to include these common outcome measures in ongoing and future COVID-19 studies. 
Therefore, the primary study outcome for the SAVE-MORE study was the comparative 11-point WHO-
CPS (see Table below) between the two arms of treatment by Day 28. This was expressed as the 
distribution of the frequencies of each score of the scale in each arm of treatment by Day 28. The 
primary endpoint was changed as agreed with EMA COVID-19 ETF from a dichotomic assessment on 
respiratory failure to the 11 point WHO-CPS scale.  
The primary endpoint that was originally proposed and agreed with EMA COVID-ETF was the 
comparative incidence of SRF between the two arms of treatment by day 14 as measured by the 11-
point WHO CPS scale. Patients dying before study visit of day 14 are considered achieving the primary 
endpoint. SRF was defined as clinical progression into hypoxemia with pO2/FiO2 <150 mmHg 
necessitating MV or NIV or ECMO.

Table 1 The WHO Clinical Progression Scale 
Secondary endpoints 
Several secondary and exploratory efficacy and safety endpoints to support the primary endpoint were 
included (see below). In addition to the 11-point of WHO-CPS score, the SOFA (sequential organ 
failure assessment) score has also been evaluated. The SOFA score can be used to evaluate organ 
dysfunction in sepsis. Also, time to discharge, long-term safety by 60 and 90 days, changes in 
circulating biomarkers and viral load were evaluated. Mortality was not included as an endpoint. 
However, a post-hoc survival analysis has been conducted by the MAH.  
The secondary outcomes included the comparison of the following between the 2 arms of treatment:  
• Change of the measure of the 11-point WHO-CPS by Day 28 from baseline Day 1 (both absolute and 
relative changes).  
• Change of the measure of the 11-point WHO-CPS by Day 14 from baseline Day 1 (both absolute and 
relative changes).  
• Change of the SOFA score* by Day 14 from baseline Day 1 (both absolute and relative changes) for 
patients who remained hospitalized by that day.  
• Change of the SOFA score by Day 7 from baseline Day 1 (both absolute and relative changes) for 
patients who remained hospitalized by that day.  
• Time until discharge from hospital.  
• Time until discharge from the intensive care unit (This was applicable only for patients who were 
admitted in the ICU).  
• Safety by Day 28.  
• Long-term safety by Day 60.  
• Long-term safety by Day 90.  
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021

• Relative changes of circulating concentrations of suPAR, CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, and IL-6 by Day 7 
from baseline Day 1.  
• Relative changes of circulating concentrations of suPAR, CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, and IL-6 by Day 4 
from baseline Day 1.  
• Change of the viral load by Day 7 from baseline Day 1 (both absolute and relative changes).  
• Change of the viral load by Day 4 from baseline Day 1 (both absolute and relative changes).  
• Transcriptomic analysis that also allowed for lymphocyte cell subset analysis.  
• Proteomic analyses.  
• Relation of endpoints to duration of disease (from first symptoms) and timing of treatment initiation.  
In addition, there are supportive comparative analyses to the primary endpoint based on the following: 
•  Being fully resolved (WHO CPS = 0) at day 28. 
•  Having severe disease (WHO CPS > 5) at day 28. 
• 
Event of SRF during trial. 
*The SOFA score is based on the 6 variables as mentioned in the table below. Each variable is scored 
between 0 and 4 points, and the SOFA score is the sum of the score of each variable. 
Table 2 The SOFA score  
Exploratory outcome  
The exploratory outcomes of the study included the comparison of the following between the 2 arms of 
treatment:  
• The cost of hospitalization.  
• The 11-point WHO-CPS by Day 60; this was expressed as the distribution of the frequencies of each 
score of the scale in each arm of treatment by Day 60.  
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 25/133 
 
 
 
 
 
• The 11-point WHO-CPS by Day 90; this was expressed as the distribution of the frequencies of each 
score of the scale in each arm of treatment by Day 90.  
• The over-time curve of the measures of the 11-point WHO-CPS between Days 1 and 14.  
Sample size 
The calculation of the sample size was based on the results of the phase II study (SAVE). According to 
this calculation: 
• The distribution of the frequencies of the main categories of the WHO CPS of SOC comparators of the 
SAVE study by Day 28 was: 21% death; hospitalized with severe disease 21%; hospitalized with 
moderate disease 13.7% and ambulatory mild disease 44.3% 
• The distribution of the frequencies of the main categories of the WHO CPS of anakinra-treated 
patients of the SAVE study by Day 28 was: 10.9% death; hospitalized with severe disease 5.4%; 
hospitalized with moderate disease 6.2%; and ambulatory mild disease 77.5%  
• 90% power at the 5% level of significance were used  
• 1:2 randomization was applied (one patient allocated to treatment Arm 1; two patients allocated to 
treatment Arm 2) 
Final calculation after adjusting for the design effect (DEFF): 600 patients needed to be enrolled in 
total (200 patients in Arm 1; and 400 patients in Arm 2). 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was made using a computer-generated randomisation chart applied for each country. 
The randomisation was made in blocks of 30 (20 for intervention and 10 for control) to achieve the 
pre-specified proportion of 2:1. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either placebo+SoC or 
anakinra+SoC randomly assigned 1:2 to placebo and anakinra. Also, randomisation was stratified 
based on severity of disease per WHO classification (moderate vs severe), administration of 
dexamethasone as SoC therapy (No vs. Yes), BMI (≤30 vs. >30), and region (Italy vs. Greece). 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was double-blinded, with both the treating physicians and staff that evaluated study 
endpoints being blind for treatment or placebo arm allocation.  
Statistical methods 
Continuous variables following normal distribution were expressed by mean and SD. Continuous 
variables not following the normal distribution were expressed by median and interquartile range. 
Binomial variables were expressed as absolute and percentage frequencies with 95% CIs. 
All the baseline continuous and binomial variables alongside comparisons of the two arms of treatment 
were provided, including demographics (sex and age), disease severity, baseline laboratory values, 
and co-administered treatment.

Analysis population 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment. The 
following patients were excluded from the FAS: 
- Patients with a major violation of the inclusion or exclusion criteria that took place before the patient 
was randomized and objectively assessed according to the ICH-E9 guideline. 
- Patients who withdrew consent and requested withdrawal of data. 
The Per-protocol (PP) set included all patients randomly assigned to treatment. The following patients 
were excluded from the entire randomized population in order to determine the PP patient population: 
- Patients with a major violation of the inclusion or exclusion criteria that took place before the patient 
was randomized and objectively assessed according to the ICH-E9 guideline. 
- Patients who withdrew consent and requested withdrawal of data. 
- Patients with a major deviation of the SoC treatment that was captured and objectively assessed 
according to the ICH-E9 guideline. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary study outcome was the comparative 11-point WHO-CPS between the two arms of 
treatment by Day 28. This was expressed as the distribution of the frequencies of each score of the 
scale in each arm of treatment by Day 28. 
Multivariate ordinal regression was the primary statistical analysis procedure followed. The basic 
assumptions of the model were the assumption of proportional odds (also called the assumption of 
parallel lines) that was checked by performing the relevant chi-square test and the goodness-of-fit 
test, reported through Pearson’s chi-square test. The dependent variable was the 11-point WHO-CPS 
scale, and the primary independent variable was the arm of treatment. The primary statistical measure 
reported was the point estimate in terms of the OR with its 95% CI, denoting the magnitude of the 
treatment effect in the multivariate model (adjusted effect). The variables used for the stratified 
randomization were entered as factors in the analysis model (i.e., severity of illness per WHO 
classification [moderate vs. severe], intake of dexamethasone in the SoC [No vs. Yes], and BMI [≤30 
vs. >30]). The region, in the form of the country (Italy vs. Greece) where the study was performed, 
was also included as a variable. 
The primary endpoint was supported by the following three pre-specified analyses:  
• Analysis of the patient’s WHO-CPS score by Day 14 in the FAS population was performed using the 
same statistical models as for the primary endpoint. 
• Contextualisation of the clinical benefit was performed with a logistic regression model run on two 
spectra of the WHO-CPS score by Day 28. The two spectra were as follows: 
-  Spectrum 1: Patients who were uninfected or not. To achieve this, the WHO-CPS was 
transformed into a binary variable of patients with fully resolved and persistent disease. 
-  Spectrum 2: Patients who remained with severe disease. To achieve this, the WHO-CPS was 
transformed into a binary variable of patients who remained severe and were classified to 
points of 6 or more (Yes) and of patients who did not remain severe and were classified to 
points of 5 or less. 
Two multivariate logistic models were run, i.e., 1 for each spectrum. In each model, the spectrum as 
the dependent variable, including independent covariate treatment allocation (placebo vs. anakinra) 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 27/133 
 
 
 
and the variables used for the stratified randomization, i.e., severity of illness per WHO classification 
(moderate vs. severe), intake of dexamethasone in the SoC (No vs. Yes), and BMI (≤30 vs. >30). The 
region, in the form of the country (Italy vs. Greece) where the study was performed, was also included 
as a variable. 
•  Analysis of the time to SRF up to Days 14 and 28 was also performed as a pre-specified 
confirmatory analysis to provide a comparison to the results of the SAVE study. This included a 
Cox proportional model of the time until progression into NIV/HFO or MV or death from the start of 
blind treatment until Days 14 and 28. In this model, the progression into NIV/HFO or MV or death 
was the dependent variable; the independent covariates were treatment allocation (placebo vs. 
anakinra) and the variables used for the stratified randomization (i.e., severity of illness per WHO 
classification [moderate vs. severe], intake of dexamethasone in the SoC [No vs. Yes], and BMI 
[≤30 vs. >30]). The region, in the form of the country (Italy vs. Greece) where the study was 
performed, was also included as a variable. 
Five sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were performed, as follows: 
•  Analysis in patients receiving at least 7 doses of the study drug. 
•  Comparison of the treatment-effect provided by the unadjusted comparison and the adjusted 
model. 
•  Complete case analysis (i.e., ignoring incomplete data) and comparison to the FAS. 
•  Responder analysis treating all missing values as failures. 
•  Analysis including the PP population. 
Any p-value below 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. 
Secondary Endpoints 
Change of the measure of the 11-point WHO-CPS by Days 14 and 28 from baseline Day 1 
The statistical analysis procedure followed was an ordinal regression analysis of the change of the 11-
point WHO-CPS by Days 14 and 28 from baseline Day 1. The variables in the equation were allocated 
group of treatment (placebo vs. anakinra), WHO severity (moderate vs. severe), intake of 
dexamethasone (No vs. Yes), and BMI (≤30 vs. >30). The region, in the form of the country (Italy vs. 
Greece) where the study was performed, was also included as a variable. 
Change of the SOFA score by Days 7 and 14 from baseline Day 1 (both absolute and relative changes)  
This analysis was applicable only for patients who remained hospitalized by Days 7 and 14, 
respectively. The statistical analysis procedure followed was an ordinal regression analysis of the 
change of the SOFA score by Days 7 and 14 from baseline Day 1. The variables in the equation were 
allocated group of treatment (placebo vs. anakinra), WHO severity (moderate vs. severe), intake of 
dexamethasone (No vs. Yes), and BMI (≤30 vs. >30). The region, in the form of the country (Italy vs. 
Greece) where the study was performed, was also included as a variable. 
Time until discharge from hospital 
Comparisons were done by Cox regression analysis, and the HR and 95% CIs were provided. A 
multivariate model was applied, including the following as covariates: allocated group of treatment 
(placebo vs. anakinra), WHO severity (moderate vs. severe), intake of dexamethasone (No vs. Yes), 
and BMI (≤30 vs. >30). The region, in the form of the country (Italy vs. Greece) where the study was 
performed, was also included as a variable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 28/133 
 
 
 
Time until discharge from the ICU 
This analysis was applicable only for patients who were admitted in the ICU after enrolment. 
Comparisons were done by univariate Cox regression analysis, and the HR and 95% CIs were 
provided. 
Relative changes of circulating concentrations of suPAR, CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, and IL-6 by Day 7 
from baseline Day 1 
This analysis excluded patients whose sampling on Day 7 was not performed because of earlier 
hospital discharge. All other missing variables were imputed by the LOCF principle. Comparison 
between groups was done by the Mann-Whitney U test. 
Relative changes of circulating concentrations of suPAR, CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, and IL-6 by Day 4 
from baseline Day 1 
This analysis excluded patients whose sampling on Day 4 was not performed because of earlier 
hospital discharge. All other missing variables were imputed by the LOCF principle. The statistical 
analysis procedure followed was the Mann-Whitney U-test. Comparison between groups was done by 
the Mann-Whitney U test. 
Change of the viral load by Day 7 from baseline Day 1 (both absolute and relative changes) 
This analysis excluded patients whose sampling on Day 7 was not performed because of earlier 
hospital discharge. All other missing variables were imputed by the LOCF principle. The viral load was 
expressed as the Ct to positivity of the real-time PCR. Each measurement was done in the pharyngeal 
swab and in the blood, and it was done separately for the genes ORF 1ab and N. Comparison between 
groups was done by the Mann-Whitney U test. 
Change of the viral load by Day 4 from baseline Day 1 (both absolute and relative changes) 
This analysis excluded patients whose sampling on Day 4 was not performed because of earlier 
hospital discharge. All other missing variables were imputed by the LOCF principle. The viral load was 
expressed as the Ct to positivity of the real-time PCR. Each measurement was done in the pharyngeal 
swab and in the blood, and it was done separately for the genes ORF 1ab and N. Comparison between 
groups was done by the Mann-Whitney U test. 
Relation of endpoints to duration of disease (from the first symptoms) and timing of treatment 
initiation 
This analysis was performed for the primary endpoint. The quartiles of time between the start of the 
first symptoms of COVID-19 and the start of the study drug were calculated. Then, the primary 
efficacy endpoint was compared between the treatment arms within each quartile. 
All statistical tests were done at 5% level. Consequentially there was no control of the family wise 
error rate, and the analyses of secondary endpoints are regarded as being supportive to the analysis of 
the primary endpoint.  
The primary study endpoint is the patient’s WHO CPS score by day 28 in the FAS population. The WHO 
CPS is a minimal but comprehensively collected outcome set that could facilitate study design and data 
sharing, and includes information on viral burden, clinical course, and survival measured. However, it 
is important to acknowledge that due to its very recent nature the CPS scale lacks validation. The 
developers of the scale state in the published paper that further testing and validation of the measure 
are needed and this process might result in further modifications to its structure. Although this might 
not prevent its use as a measure of treatment intensity within clinical trials with COVID-19, as stated 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 29/133 
 
 
 
by the WHO group that developed the scale, results from this only primary outcome should be 
interpreted with caution. 
The stand out factor in the approach proposed is the fact that, depending on the relative distribution 
across the primary 11-point scale outcome it is proposed that the scale is transformed to a 5-point 
scale or even to a binomial variable to compare patients in all other scales against the baseline scale of 
uninfected patients. In case the latter case it is stated that logistic regression will be applied. Due to 
the lack of validation of the scale there is enough evidence that aggregating categories will not affect 
the reliability of the scale. This should be considered when interpreting the results in case the need to 
aggregate categories of the scale is verified. 
The MAH provided the outcome of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test performed for several of the 
secondary endpoints and the consequent specification for the statistical analyses. Some endpoints 
analysed are conditioned by the presence/absence of specific events, such that only a proportion of the 
population is analysed, e.g. discharge from ICU or change in SOFA score at day 14. However, the MAH 
did not identified this as a joint endpoint (entering ICU together with leaving ICU or remain in hospital 
at day 14 together with SOFA score) and omitted the conditional event doing only a marginal analysis 
on the other part of the joint endpoint. Since efficacy is supposed to have an impact on the conditioned 
event, a proper analysis would in principle include both parts. Upon request from the CHMP, an 
updated analysis was provided by the MAH which allowed to better understand the treatment effects, 
but due to the conditional nature of these endpoints, there remains considerable unclarity on how the 
results are to be interpreted. However, it is unlikely that the B/R assessment will be impacted and 
therefore, the issue was not further pursued by the CHMP.  
The MAH specified that in the time-to-event analyses data were censored at the end of the analysed 
period (Day 14, Day 28). However, the MAH should have specified the censoring strategy for each time 
to event analysis, e.g. in the analysis of “Time to hospital discharge” how were patients who died 
before Day 28 handled and how were data censored for withdrawals and dropouts. Upon request from 
the CHMP, the MAH explained that the number at risk of patients in each group at day 4,8,12,16,20,24 
and 28 will be provided at the bottom of all survival curves as well as the standard output from time-
to-event analysis, such as median time to event or equivalent in the final CSR, planned to be 
submitted by End of December 2021 via a type II variation, which is acceptable.  
Handling of missing data 
Imputation of missing data was done by the principle of Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). The 
only exclusion of the LOCF rule is for biomarkers not sampled on days 4 and 7 because of earlier 
hospital discharge. In all other cases, the LOCF principle was applied for the biomarker analysis as 
well. There has only been one patient for which the primary endpoint, WHO-CPS at Day 28, was 
missing. The patient was allocated to treatment with placebo. With the principle of last-observation 
carried forward for the primary analysis the WHO-CPS at Day 28, the value was considered 0 and can 
as such be considered conservative and it did not change the statistics of the comparative analysis. 
Further analyses of the primary endpoint have been completed to assess the impact of intercurrent 
events. The MAH made three sensitivity analyses to handle intercurrent events. One based on the 
population of patients who did not experience an intercurrent event and two using a hypothetical 
strategy for the intercurrent events (a “worst-case scenario” where patients with intercurrent events 
were imputed to have the worst-case outcome on the WHO-CPS, i.e. score=10, and a “LOCF scenario” 
using last available WHO-CPS score before the first intercurrent event).

Results 
Participant flow 
See disposition of patients below. 
Figure 2 Disposition of patients  
Recruitment 
A total of 1060 patients were screened from December 2020 through March 2021, and 606 patients 
were enrolled at 37 study sites (29 in Greece and 8 in Italy) and randomized to one of the 2 treatment 
arms. 194 patients were allocated to the placebo+SoC arm and 412 patients were allocated to the 
anakinra+SoC arm. 12 patients withdrew consent and requested the removal of all data, leaving a final 
ITT (FAS) analysis set of 594 patients with 189 patients in the placebo+SoC arm and 405 patients in 
the anakinra+SoC arm. One patient allocated to the placebo+SoC arm was reported as lost to follow-
up (but were still part of the FAS). 
Extent of exposure  
594 hospitalized patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 pneumonia (WHO classification) were 
exposed in this study. 27 patients with moderate pneumonia and 162 patients with severe pneumonia 
received placebo+SoC treatment. 82 patients with moderate pneumonia and 323 patients with severe 
pneumonia received anakinra+SoC treatment (see Table below). The mean number of administered 
doses of study drug for all the patients was 8.6. The mean number of administered doses was similar 
for both the treatment groups (placebo+SoC [8.7]; anakinra+SoC [8.4]). The median duration of 
Assessment report

exposure (minimum, maximum) of anakinra was 10 (1,10) days and the same for placebo was 10 
(2,10) days. 
Patients (n=5 in the placebo arm and 7 in the anakinra arm) who withdrew consent and requested 
withdrawal of data (already obtained) were not part of the FAS.  
Inclusion was guided by suPAR being noted that many patients (n=405) were excluded after screening 
based on suPAR<6 ng/ml.   
Conduct of the study 
Changes in the conduct of the study  
The following changes from the schedule of assessments were included in the interim clinical study 
report:  
• Measurements of the 11-point WHO-CPS were not marked in the schedule of assessments, but were 
recorded on Day 1, Day 28, and on Days 60 and 90.  
• SOFA score was recorded only at Day 1, Day 7, and Day 14 and not recorded on Days 2, 3, 4, 5 ,6, 
8, 9, 10.  
• Blood sampling for suPAR, CRP, IL-6, ferritin, D-dimers, transcriptomic, and proteomic analysis was 
not performed at screening. 
Changes in the planned analyses 
The following changes from the analysis specified in the protocol v. 2.0 and SAP v. 4.0 were included 
in the interim clinical study report and were done prior to database lock and based on advice from the 
EMA COVID-19 ETF: 
•Before database lock and unblinding, the analyses methods for the primary endpoint and secondary 
endpoints were updated and described in more detail in the SAP compared to the protocol. 
•The patients who withdrew consent and requested withdrawal of data also were excluded from the 
SAS, although not defined that way in the SAP. 
•The changes of the ordinal scale of the 11-point WHO-CPS and the SOFA score were unintentionally 
mentioned as “between Days 14 and 28” instead of “at Days 14 and 28” in the SAP. 
•The analyses of treatment differences in biomarker and viral load endpoints (change from baseline) 
were performed by using the Mann-Whitney U test, not ANCOVA or ordinal regression analysis as 
stated in the SAP. 
•The univariate Cox regression analysis of “Survival analysis/Time to death by Day 28” was added as a 
post hoc analysis, although not specified in the list of analysis. 
•The secondary outcome “Time until discharge from the ICU” was analysed using the univariate model, 
not the multivariate model due to the low number of patients. 
Protocol deviations 
The rate of protocol deviations from the SoC treatment was significantly greater in the patients 
allocated to the placebo arm than in the patients allocated to the anakinra arm (14.3 % vs. 3.2 %). 
Significant differences were found for “administration of 6 mg/day dexamethasone for more than 10 
days”, “Administration of dexamethasone 6-18 mg daily with MTP for 10 days” and “Stop study drug, 
administration of TCZ+IVIG+ANA”. It is unclear whether these differences affected the results 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 32/133 
 
 
 
obtained, however these deviations are not expected to artificially inflate the anakinra’s effect. Further, 
these patients were excluded from the PP analysis. 
Study sites 
In total patients were recruited from 37 different sites. The study recruitment was competitive 
between the participating sites and there were no limits to the number of included patients by each 
site/country nor an imbalance in the allocation.

The definition of the WHO classification on the severity of pneumonia according to the protocol is 
provided below:  
•  Moderate illness: clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnoea, fast breathing) but no 
signs of severe pneumonia, including SpO2 ≥90% on room air. These patients are not in need 
of oxygen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 34/133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Severe disease: clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnea, fast breathing) plus one of 
the following: respiratory rate >30 breaths/minute; severe respiratory distress; or SpO2 <90% 
on room air. These patients need oxygen.  
Respiratory distress and need for oxygen supplementation are guiding severity.  
Baseline viral load is provided below.  
Baseline WHO-CPS is provided below. 
The distribution of patients by treatment group and oxygen use is provided below; the p-value of the 
Pearson X2 test of the distribution of the frequencies between the 2 groups is 0.325. 
The overall median time from symptom onset to enrolment was 9 days, and the median time from 
hospital admission to enrolment was 2 days. Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH provided a 
separate list of baseline medication and a separate list of co-administered treatment during the study. 
A marginally higher proportion in the anakinra arm received remdesivir whereas the opposite was the 
case for dexamethasone at baseline. In addition, more patients received antibiotics in the placebo arm. 
Pip/tazo was received in 19% in the placebo arm and 15.8% in the anakinra arm. Further, more 
patients in the placebo arm received cephalosporines with 58% in the anakinra arm and 63% in the 
placebo arm. Overall, baseline medications were equally distributed between the arms. However, 
during the study, more patients received furosemide in the placebo arm than in the anakinra arm 
Assessment report

(19.6% vs 10.9%, respectively). Further, more patients received propofol in the placebo arm than in 
the anakinra arm (11.1 % vs 4.7%, respectively) and more received noradrenaline in the placebo arm 
than in the anakinra arm (11.6% vs 4.9%, respectively). 
The study drug compliance was determined from the empty syringes that were stored after the study 
drug administration. The mean number of administered doses of study drug for all the patients was 
8.6.  
Baseline characteristics  
The baseline characteristics were overall equally distributed across treatment arms. However, based on 
the WHO classification, the majority of the patients (91.6%) were identified with severe COVID-19 
pneumonia, and 8.4 % of patients were identified with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. Numerically 
more patients in the placebo arm had severe pneumonia (94.2% vs 90.4% in the anakinra group), 
lower PO2/FiO2, slightly higher WHO-CPS and more patients received antibiotics. The only parameter 
pointing in a direction of the anakinra arm being slightly sicker is the fact that more patients in the 
anakinra arm progressed between screening and inclusion, as rapid progression is an important clinical 
measure for a more severe outcome. Further insight on the differences in baseline disease severity has 
been provided upon request from the CHMP. The MAH considered that the allocation of patients with 
severe COVID-19 is similar between arms despite the numeric differences observed. Further, the 
differences in baseline disease severity could potentially impact on differences in disease severity at 
day 28 in favour of the investigative drug.  However, CHMP agreed that these differences (Severe 
COVID-19 by WHO) were taken in account in the multivariate analysis.  
SOFA score was very similar in both groups 2.5 and 2.4 in the placebo and anakinra group 
respectively.  Days from symptom onset (9 days) and from hospitalization (2 days) were similar in 
both groups. 
Regarding laboratory values (WBC, Lymphocyte count, CRP, IL-6, Ferritin, and D-dimer) there were no 
differences between the two arms, except for a slightly higher IL-6 level in the placebo group (20.1 vs 
15.5), which is assessed as not important. The included population had suPAR of median (IQR) 7.6 
(6.9-9.1).   
Comorbidity  
The frequency of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Chronic heart failure, Chronic renal disease, Chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, Coronary heart disease and Atrial fibrillation were well balanced 
between treatment arms. There is no information on asthma.  
Baseline/Co-administered medication 
A marginally higher proportion in the anakinra arm received remdesivir whereas the opposite was the 
case for dexamethasone at enrolment. This is not expected to have any clinical impact. However, as of 
March 31, 2021, the antiviral remdesivir and dexamethasone are the available SoC treatments that are 
recommended by the WHO for patients with COVID-19. For patients classified with moderate disease, 
SoC treatments include anticoagulation and remdesivir. For patients classified with severe disease, SoC 
treatments include anticoagulation, oxygen supply, dexamethasone, and remdesivir. 
SAVE-MORE study had First Patient First Visit on 23 December 2020, and in total 606 patients were 
enrolled (194 patients in the placebo arm and 412 patients in the active arm). Of 20 February 2021, 
225 patients had been enrolled, i.e. prior to the time that remdesivir and dexamethasone were 
introduced as SoC for COVID-19 treatment. Hence, a substantial number (> 1/3 of enrolled patients) 
of patients in SAVE-MORE were included in the study before the new SoC with remdesivir and 
dexamethasone was implemented. However, the MAH stated that the recruitment period was only 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021

three months and that there were no relevant changes in SOC or temporal trends in the prescription of 
remdesivir as SOC in the period. The data provided in the table below does not support any 
modification of anakinra effect by remdesivir use. 
Table 4 Univariate and multivariate ordinal regression analyses of the WHO-CPS at Day 28 
A subgroup of patients did not receive dexamethasone at any time during the study. The table below 
show the univariate and multivariate analyses of the 84 patients not receiving dexamethasone. For 
clarification, the patients who had not commenced dexamethasone at baseline, did not receive 
dexamethasone at any time during the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021

At baseline more patients received antibiotics in the placebo arm. This probably reflects that more 
patients in the placebo arm had severe pneumonia, as discussed above. Besides of that baseline 
medications were equally distributed between the arms. However, during the trial more patients 
received furosemide in the placebo arm 19.6% vs 10,9% in the anakinra arm. Further, more patients 
received propofol in the placebo arm 11.1 % vs 4.7% and more received noradrenaline in the placebo 
arm 11.6% vs 4.9% in the anakinra arm, reflecting that more patients in the placebo arm deteriorated 
to SRF.   
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021

Viral load in blood measured as copies of SARS-CoV-2 gene was equal in both groups. The MAH has 
not provided data and analyses on variants and argue that the hyperinflammatory consequences 
remain the same, which is agreed and acceptable. 
As the study drug was an s.c. injection administered at the hospital, no issues are expected regarding 
study drug compliance.  
Numbers analysed 
In total 1060 patients were screened and hereof 606 patients were randomized 1:2 to placebo+SoC 
n= 194 or to anakinra+SoC n=412. 12 patients withdrew consent leaving a final ITT (FAS) analysis set 
of 594 patients (n=189 in the placebo+SoC arm and n=405 in the anakinra+SoC arm). Patients (n=5 
in the placebo arm and 7 in the anakinra arm) who withdrew consent and requested withdrawal of data 
(already obtained) were not part of the FAS.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary study endpoint, the comparative 11-point WHO-CPS between the two arms of treatment 
by Day 28, was expressed as the OR for allocation to lower severity after anakinra treatment 
compared to placebo. See Figure below. Covariates entered in the multivariate model were those used 
for stratified randomization. The unadjusted OR at Day 28 was 0.36 (95 % CI 0.26 to 0.49; P<0.001) 
(see Figure and Table below).

Table 6 WHO-CPS at Day 28 – FAS population  
The primary outcome  
The prespecified primary endpoint was the comparative 11-point WHO-CPS between the two arms of 
treatment, and was expressed as the OR for allocation to lower severity after anakinra treatment 
compared to placebo at day 28 in the FAS population. This was assessed by ordinal regression analysis 
unadjusted and adjusted for other factors (administration of dexamethasone, severe COVID-19, 
BMI>30kg/m2 and country). The unadjusted OR at Day 28 was 0.36 (95 % CI 0.26 to 0.49; P<0.001), 
hence the primary endpoint was met and statistically significant. Also, in the adjusted (multivariate) 
analysis anakinra+SoC was beneficial (OR 0.36; 95 % CI 0.26 to 0.50; P<0.001).  
Based on the distribution of WHO-CPS at day 28, the proportion of patients with severe outcome 
needing oxygen supplementary WHO-CP score ≥ 5 is higher in the placebo arm than in the anakinra 
Assessment report

arm. This indicates an overall beneficial effect of anakinra treatment. However, there are few “events” 
in the severe groups, and numbers are low. The interpretation is eased by some of the supportive 
analysis of the primary endpoints such as “time to progression to severe respiratory failure”, see 
below.  
Supportive analyses of the primary endpoint 
There were three supportive analysis of the primary endpoint:  
1)  The unadjusted OR of the ordinal regression analysis of the WHO-CPS by Day 14 was 0.57 (95 % 
CI 0.44 to 0.77; P<0.001). See Figure below. The OR adjusted after multivariate analysis was 0.58 
(95 % CI 0.42 to 0.79; P=0.001). 
Figure 4: First supportive analysis of the study primary outcome, WHO-CPS by Day 14 – FAS 
population 
2)  The second supportive analysis to confirm the primary endpoint was designed to explain how the 
treatment benefit of anakinra may be associated with the two spectra of the WHO-CPS by Day 28. 
For the analysis of the first spectrum, patients were divided into those who were fully recovered by 
Day 28 with negative viral load and into those who had persistent disease ranging between points 
1 to 10 of the WHO-CPS by Day 28. See Table below.

EMA/772497/2021  
Page 41/133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 7: Analysis towards fully resolved or persistent disease (first spectrum) – FAS population 
For the analysis of the second spectrum, patients were divided into those who by Day 28 were 
allocated to 6 or more points of the WHO-CPS (severe hospitalized and dead) and into those who were 
allocated into 5 or less points of the WHO-CPS. The multivariate logistic regression model for the 
second spectrum of the WHO-CPS are shown in the Table below.  
Table 8: Analysis towards allocation into WHO-CPS≥6 (Yes) or WHO-CPS≤5 (second spectrum) – FAS 
population 
3)  The third supportive analysis was a univariate and multivariate stepwise Cox regression analysis of 
respiratory failure progression during the first 14 and 28 days. SRF was defined as respiratory 
ratio-PF <150 necessitating HFO/NIV/MV or death by Day 14 or Day 28. See Table below.

Post hoc analysis (survival analysis)  
The below Figure shows the Kaplan-Meier curve of time to death. The univariate Cox regression 
analysis of time to death by Day 28 showed that anakinra treatment reduced the mortality compared 
to placebo (HR: 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.98, P=0.045); 6.9% of patients in the placebo+SoC group and 
3.2% of patients in the anakinra+SoC group died by Day 28 (see also Table 6).

Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint 
Five sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were performed (see Tables below). The first four 
sensitivity analyses were univariate and multivariate ordinal regression analyses of the primary study 
outcome (WHO-CPS) at Day 28. Covariates entered in the multivariate model were the same as those 
used for stratified randomization.

Table 12: Sensitivity analysis 3 – Complete case analysis  
Table 13: Sensitivity analysis 4 – Responder analysis treating missing values as failures 
Table 14: Sensitivity analysis 5 – Comparison of the unadjusted and the adjusted model 
Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH provided results based on the originally proposed primary 
endpoint (dichotomic assessment on respiratory failure). Univariate and multivariate stepwise analyses 
of the incidence and time to SRF progression at Day 14 were performed. SRF was defined as P/F <150 
necessitating HFO/NIV/MV or death. In both analyses, anakinra treatment prevented the progression 
to SRF by Day 14. The adjusted OR for the incidence of SRF by Day 14 is 0.59 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.89), 
and this is consistent with the analysis using the ordinal WHO-CPS scale at Day 14 (adjusted OR: 0.58, 
95% CI: 0.42 to 0.79).  
In order to handle intercurrent events three sensitivity analyses were completed. For the first 
sensitivity analysis, the treatment effect only in patients who did not experience an intercurrent event 
was estimated. Results are consistent with the primary analysis (primary analysis adjusted OR =0.36, 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 45/133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
95% CI [0.26 to 0.50] versus OR = 0.35, 95% CI [0.25 to 0.50] for patients without intercurrent 
events). For the second patients with intercurrent events were imputed to have the worst-case 
outcome on the WHO-CPS, i.e. score=10 for the primary endpoint. The overall OR were consistent with 
the current primary analysis results (primary analysis adjusted OR: 0.36, 95% CI [0.26 to 0.50] 
versus OR=0.31, 95% CI [0.22 to 0.42] using this hypothetical estimand approach). For the third data 
beyond the intercurrent event was imputed with the patients' last available score before the event. 
Again, results are very consistent with the primary analysis (primary analysis adjusted OR = 0.36, 
95% CI [0.26 to 0.50] versus OR=0.32, 95% CI: [0.23 to 0.44] using this hypothetical estimand 
approach).  
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Analysis of the clinical secondary endpoints are shown in the Table below. The decrease of the WHO-
CPS score from baseline to Days 14 and 28 and of the SOFA score from baseline to Day 7 were 
significantly greater in the anakinra+SoC arm compared to the placebo+SoC arm. Moreover, in the 
anakinra+SoC group, the average time until hospital discharge was 1 day shorter and the time until 
ICU discharge was 4 days shorter than in the placebo+SoC group.  
Table 15: Secondary efficacy endpoints – FAS population 
Regarding the absolute and relative changes of the WHO-CPS at day 14 from baseline Day1, results 
are also in favour of anakinra.  
The absolute and relative changes of the SOFA score at day 7 from baseline Day1 were greater in the 
anakinra arm as compared to the SoC arm. Nevertheless, the SOFA score was only assessed in few

patients in each group (n= 66 in the placebo arm and n=120 in the anakinra arm), it is assumed to be 
because SOFA scores were only assessed in hospitalized patients.  
Time until discharge from hospital 
The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the time until hospital discharge was 1 day 
shorter in the anakinra+SoC group than in the placebo+SoC group (HR: 1.21; 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.45; 
P=0.042) (see Table and Figure below).

This analysis included only the patients who were admitted in the ICU. The univariate Cox regression 
analysis showed that the time until ICU discharge was 4 days shorter in the anakinra+SoC group than 
in the placebo+SoC group (HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.11-4.92; P=0.026) (see Figure below). Multivariate 
analysis was not performed because of the low number of patients.  
Figure 8: Time until discharge from the ICU 
Time until discharge from ICU is a conditional analysis on entering ICU, and reporting the marginal 
only is not regarded as sufficient (see discussion on clinical efficacy). Time until discharge from ICU is 
shorter in the anakinra arm. The Kaplan-Meier curves separate from approximately day 9. Some clarity 
regarding censoring is still lacking. However, since this endpoint will be regarded as only supportive, 
this issue is not further pursued. Multivariate analysis was not performed because of the low number of 
patients, which is acceptable.  
Relative changes of circulating concentrations of suPAR, CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, and IL-6 by 
Day 4 and 7 from baseline Day 1.  
Concentrations of suPAR, CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, IL-6 and viral load were measured at three time 
points, baseline Day 1, on Days 4 and 7 for enrolled patients. The change from baseline at Days 4 and 
7 in suPAR decreased significantly more in the anakinra+SoC group than in the placebo+SoC group (-
21.0 % [41.3%] and -12.8% [43.3%], P=0.006 at Day 4; -17.1% [46.9%] and -2.5% [57.1%] at Day 
7; P<0.001). See Figure below. CRP and IL-6 decreased more in the anakinra+SoC group than in the 
placebo+SoC group, while D-dimers and ferritin changes were similar in the 2 treatment groups. The 
changes of the viral gene expressions did not differ between the treatment groups.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary endpoints in three main subgroups of patients.  
•  Gender (male and female).  
•  Patients with suPAR of >9 ng/mL and ≤9 ng/mL before randomization.  
•  Patients with Charlson’s Comorbidity Index (CCI) score of ≥2 and <2 before randomization. No 
subgroup analysis was performed for age since age was calculated with CCI.  
Overall, results were consistent with the primary analysis showing unadjusted OR in favour of anakinra 
in all the subgroups. There were minimal differences between females and males; suPAR above 9 
ng/mL or at 9 ng/mL or below; Charlson’s Comorbidity Index (CCI) <2 or ≥2 as shown below. 
Subgroup analysis for female patients showed in the univariate analysis OR 0.44 (0.27-0.72) p=0.001 
and for male patients in the univariate analysis OR 0.30 (0.20-0.47) p<0.001.   
Subgroup analysis for suPAR ≤ 9ng/mL in the univariate analysis OR 0.36 (0.25-0.5) p<0.001 and for 
suPAR > 9ng/mL OR 0.35 (0.18-0.65) p=0.001.   
Subgroup analysis for CCI <2 in the univariate analysis OR 0.42 (0.24-0.73) p=0.003, and for CCI ≥ 2 
OR 0.33 (0.23-0.49) p<0.001. 
The effect of anakinra was similar in patients below and above 65 years of age as shown in the table 
below.

Supportive study 
The SAVE study 
The SAVE study is an ongoing, prospective, open-label, single-arm study. Eligible patients in the SAVE 
study were the same as the patient population in the SAVE-MORE study (i.e., males and females ≥18 
years of age hospitalized with confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus, LRTI [radiologically 
confirmed], and plasma suPAR levels ≥6 ng/mL). Patients were included in two periods. Eligible 
patients in the SAVE study received SoC and anakinra 100 mg s.c. q.d. for 10 days.  See Figure below 
for study-flow. 
Figure 13: SAVE study flow chart of patient selection of the 2 periods (SAVE study) 
In the first period from April to September 2020, 130 patients were included in the study and treated 
with anakinra+SoC and compared to a propensity matched control group of 130 patients receiving SoC 
treatment (in the same period and at same centers). Baseline data were comparative between the two 
groups. Results were in benefit for anakinra 22.3% (95 % CI: 16.0 to 30.2) receiving anakinra+SoC 
progressed to SRF by Day 14 (primary endpoint), whereas 59.2 % (50.6 to 67.3 %) among the 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 56/133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
parallel SoC-treated patients progressed to SRF by Day 14 (adjusted HR=0.28; 95 % CI: 0.18 to 0.44, 
p<0.001).   
Table 18: Primary, secondary, and exploratory study outcomes of the first period (SAVE study) 
In the SAVE study period 2; parallel SoC-treated patients and anakinra+SoC-treated patients (117 and 
525 patients, respectively) were included. Due to the few available comparators, no propensity score 
matching was done. This means that the control group did not match the anakinra group in some 
essential ways e.g. the proportion having severe COVID-19 by WHO was 68.4% of the comparators 
and 82.7 % of the anakinra arm (p=0.0001) and diabetes type 2 in 12.8 % in the comparator arm vs 
22.7% in the anakinra arm (p=0.017). However, since severe COVID-19 was more frequent in the 
anakinra arm this could not affect the effect positively and is thus acceptable. The incidence of SRF 
among the parallel SoC-treated patients was significantly greater compared to the patients treated 
with anakinra (adjusted HR=0.33; 95 % CI: 0.32 to 0.49; p<0.001). See Figure below. Further, 
Mortality Day 28 was decreased: Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that survival was 
prolonged among the patients treated with anakinra (HRadj: 0.38; 95 % CI: 0.23 to 0.62; p<0.001).

In both periods of the SAVE study, secondary efficacy endpoints were supportive of the primary 
endpoint and demonstrated clinical improvement with anakinra treatment. However, the design of the 
SAVE trial does not facilitate a robust comparison of the treatment effects of anakinra towards a 
control. Even though a control group is established by the use of propensity scoring, the value of such 
a control is questionable. Furthermore, both the selection of subjects for intervention with anakinra, 
done at investigators discretion and the selection for the controls, which is not sufficiently described, 
could be the source of considerable biased treatment effects. It is agreed that results from the first two 
periods of the SAVE study, though not randomized nor blinded, provide support for the efficacy for the 
treatment of anakinra in patients with moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonia who are at risk of 
progressing to SRF. It should be noted that this study was also suPAR guided and included only 
patients with suPAR>6 ng/mL as for SAVE MORE. 
When analysing the two main secondary study outcomes of the SAVE study, i.e. the effect of 
anakinra treatment on circulating inflammatory biomarkers and function of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cell (PBMCs), it was noted that suPAR was increased among anakinra-treated patients 
on Day 7 from baseline. Nevertheless, one would expect suPAR to decrease in patients with beneficial 
effect of anakinra. Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH clarified that there was a difference 
between using suPAR as a prognostic marker and as a response marker. Additionally, data showed 
that suPAR increase or decrease by Day 7 is not relevant to predict the progression to SRF or 30 day-
mortality. It is agreed that the evidence presented does not support the use of suPAR as a response 
biomarker. 
Additional studies with anakinra in the treatment of COVID-19  
Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH clarified that very few completed, randomized, controlled 
studies are available: SAVE-MORE, CORIMUNO-ANA-1, REMAP-CAP, COV-AID. Further, there are five 
ongoing/completed studies with no published results and four terminated. An overview of the three 
randomized controlled studies of IL1-RA agents in the treatment of COVID-19 (besides SAVE-MORE) is 
presented below:  
The CORIMUNO-ANA-1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study of 116 patients with 
moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (requiring min 3 L/min, WHO-CPS at 5) randomized 1:1 to high-dose 
i.v. anakinra at 200 mg twice daily for 3 days, followed by lower dosing over 2 days or non-
standardized SoC treatment at the discretion of the physician. In this study anakinra did not improve 
survival or need for MV or NIV. See table below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 58/133 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 19: Primary and secondary efficacy outcomes (CORIMUNO-ANA-1, Lancet Respir Med 
2021;9;295-304) 
It is acknowledged that CORIMUNO-ANA-1 might have had an inadequate sample size. The study was 
ended prematurely due to futility, as the study did not show any difference in the primary endpoint 
between treatment arms after inclusion of 116 patients. Anakinra was administered in a higher dose 
but for a marginally shorter time than in the SAVE-MORE study, and the cumulative dose was higher. 
The included population reflects the included population in the SAVE-MORE study, with the exception 
that the SAVE-MORE study only included patients with a suPAR ≥6 ng/ml, whereas the COVIMUNO-
ANA-1 included patients based on CRP >25 mg/ml.    
REMAP-CAP was an open-label, randomized, adaptive platform study investigating multiple 
therapeutic approaches in critically ill COVID-19 patients, hereof also anakinra n=373. Patients 
enrolled in REMAP-CAP had already progressed to requiring intensive care and respiratory and/or 
cardiovascular support at baseline. The REMAP-CAP study (although not peer reviewed yet) showed no 
effect on the primary endpoint of anakinra compared with standard of care in critical ill patients.  
COV-AID was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study. The COV-AID 
study has a 2 × 2 factorial design to evaluate IL-1 blockade vs no IL-1 blockade and IL-6 blockade vs 
no IL-6 blockade. Only 44 patients received anakinra alone. The studied population differ from the 
SAVE-MORE population in a tendency toward more severe disease. Patients in the COV-AID have lower 
PaO2/FiO2 median 135 (82-233) (PaO2/FiO2<150 excluded in SAVE-MORE), higher laboratory values 
(CRP, Ferritin, D-dimer) and fewer received remdesivir (5%) and dexamethasone (64%). In addition, 
the study design is complex and it seems that 2/3 of the patients assessed in the primary endpoint 
also received IL-6 blocker (in both the IL-1 group and in the comparator group). The study showed no 
benefit of anakinra.

4 terminated studies were also summarized by the MAH. Sobi.IMMUNO-101 study was ended after 
inclusion of five patients in the anakinra group. The MAH explain that the trial was prematurely 
terminated for unknown reasons and data are not available. JAKINCOV a phase 2, open-label, 
randomized, controlled trial assessing the efficacy of anakinra and ruxolitinib in patients with severe 
and critical COVID-19. The study was ended after inclusion of two patients for unknown reason. 
INFLAMMACOV a phase 3, open-label, prospective, randomized trial assessing the efficacy of 
anakinra or tocilizumab alone or in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with severe COVID-19 
(stages 2b and 3). Further details and reason for termination are not available. The fourth prematurely 
terminated study was ANACONDA a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial comparing 
the administration of optimized SoC and anakinra vs optimized SoC alone in patients with COVID-19 
and worsening respiratory symptoms hospitalized in a medical unit. Due to a concern about an 
imbalance in the number of deaths in the anakinra arm compared to SOC the study was stopped after 
inclusion of 71 patients. The MAH clarified that the French Health Authority made further analysis of 
data from ANACONDA, as well as results available from other clinical studies and confirmed that there 
was no potential safety risk linked to the use of anakinra in COVID-19 patients. However, no data were 
made available.  
In addition, the MAH referred to 3 systematic review/Meta-analyses including both observational 
and RCT data of anakinra use in COVID-19. The study by, Kyriazopoulou et al included 9 studies of 
patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia due to COVID-19: 8 studies were observational, and 
1 was an RCT (i.e. CORIMUNO-ANA-1). Numbers of patients in the studies were 12- 130 treated with 
anakinra. Mortality was significantly lower in anakinra-treated patients (38/342 [11.1 %]) as compared 
with 137/553 (24.8 %) observed in patients receiving SoC and/or placebo on top of SoC. Barkas et al 
2021 made a systematic review of 9 studies included, 7 studies overlapped with Kyriazopoulou’s meta-
analysis and numbers of patients in the studies were 12- 130 treated with anakinra. Anakinra reduced 
the need for invasive MV (OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.85, p=0.02, I2=67%; 6 studies, n=587) 
compared with SoC. Kyriakoulis et al 2021 made a systematic review of 6 studies including SAVE-
MORE and SAVE. The pooled HR for death in patients treated with anakinra was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.34 to 
0.65). The systematic reviews point in a direction of benefit of anakinra. However, the studies included 
are small and mostly controlled by historical cohorts, where the SoC was different as compared with 
today.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Anakinra is a recombinant human IL-1Ra that blocks the activity of cytokine IL-1 (IL-1α and IL-1β) by 
competitively inhibiting its binding to the IL-1RI, thus controlling active inflammation. Anakinra is 
currently approved for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis, all forms of Cryopyrin-associated 
periodic syndrome, Still’s disease (including Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and Adult-onset Still’s 
disease) and for Familial Mediterranean fever in the EU. With this application, the MAH is proposing to 
add a new indication for the treatment of COVID-19. The MAH initially sought a broad indication as 
follows: ‘Kineret is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult 
patients with pneumonia who are at risk of developing severe respiratory failure.’ However, this was 
not considered acceptable by the CHMP and is further discussed below.  
This application is primarily based on one single pivotal phase 3 study (SAVE-MORE), an investigator-
sponsored study. The results discussed below are based on the interim CSR. Final CSR will be 
submitted by end of December 2021 as a Type II variation and will contain data by day 60 and day 90. 
Further, the MAH submitted results from the ongoing, open label phase 2 study (SAVE) which was 
considered as supportive by the CHMP. Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH also presented 
additional studies conducted with anakinra in the treatment of COVID-19, which are discussed below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 60/133 
 
 
 
No dose response studies were performed in subjects with COVID-19. The posology proposed by the 
MAH is as follows: 100 mg s.c. once daily for 10 days. The supportive Phase 2 SAVE study was 
considered as a dose defining study and together with data available for other anakinra indications was 
sufficient to inform on the choice of the dose for COVID-19 patients. This was agreed by the CHMP.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
SAVE-MORE was a pivotal, confirmatory, prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anakinra guided by suPAR in patients with LRTI 
by SARS-CoV-2 in improving the clinical state of COVID-19 over 28 days. Patients were randomly 
assigned 1:2 to one of the two treatment groups placebo+SoC or anakinra+SoC. Anakinra was 
injected s.c. as 100 mg once daily for 10 days.  
Patients were recruited from 37 sites. However, protocol deviations from the SoC treatment were not 
equally distributed and occurred significantly more often in the placebo group 14,3% than in the 
anakinra group 3.2%. Deviations consisted of increase of the corticosteroid or discontinuation of the 
study drug and administration of other anti-cytokines.  
Bias in the comparative analyses related to intercurrent events are considered to favor the placebo 
group and thus are considered conservative with regards to the estimated treatment difference. This is 
supported by the requested post hoc analysis, in which bias due to intercurrent events were minimized 
by relevant means of imputation. Further, in the post hoc analysis submitted by the MAH, the 
difference to placebo remained significant, in line with what was seen in the pre-defined analyses. 
Furthermore, the estimated treatment difference (i.e. the placebo controlled anakinra effect) was more 
pronounced with a point estimate of the OR of 0.32 vs 0.36 in the pre-defined analysis in which bias of 
intercurrent events was not addressed. The issue on handling of intercurrent events was therefore 
considered to be sufficiently addressed by the CHMP.  
As the study drug was an s.c. injection administered at the hospital, no issues were considered to be 
expected regarding study drug compliance.  
Overall, the conduct of the study is acceptable by the CHMP. 
Endpoints 
The primary study endpoint was the comparative 11-point WHO-CPS between the 2 arms. This was 
expressed as the distribution of the frequencies of each score of the scale in each arm of treatment by 
Day 28. The primary endpoint was changed during the study conduct from a dichotomic assessment on 
respiratory failure to the 11 point WHO-CPS scale. Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH conducted a 
sensitivity analysis based on the original primary endpoint. The results are presented and discussed 
below. The MAH performed several sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint, and supportive 
secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints. In addition to the 11-point of WHO-CPS score, the SOFA 
(sequential organ failure assessment) sepsis score was also evaluated. Further, time to discharge, time 
to progression of disease and long-term safety by 60 and 90 days were also evaluated. Overall, the 
primary and secondary endpoints of the pivotal SAVE-MORE study are adequate for the objectives 
defined as part of the study. 
Statistical analysis 
All statistical tests were done at 5% level. Consequentially there was no control of the family wise 
error rate, and the analyses of secondary endpoints are thus regarded as being supportive of the 
primary endpoint. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 61/133 
 
 
 
 
Adjustment by factors used in the randomisation was not done according to the Guideline on 
adjustment for baseline covariates in clinical trials (EMA/CHMP/295050/2013), as these were included 
as main effects in the analyses, whereas any interactions have been excluded. Furthermore, ‘country’ 
also appeared to be a stratification factor but was not included in any of the analyses performed by the 
MAH. Due to the limited impact across the secondary endpoints and taking into account that those 
endpoints are only supportive, the issue on stratification factors was not pursued further by the CHMP. 
Some endpoints analysed were conditioned by the presence/absence of specific events, such that only 
a proportion of the population was analysed, e.g. discharge from ICU or change in SOFA score at day 
14. However, the MAH did not identify this as a joint endpoint (entering ICU together with leaving ICU; 
or remaining in hospital at day 14 together with SOFA score) and did omit the conditional event doing 
only a marginal analysis on the other part of the joint endpoint. Since efficacy is supposed to have an 
impact on the conditioned event, a proper analysis should have included both parts. Upon request from 
the CHMP, an updated analysis considering these endpoints to be joint was provided by the MAH, it 
provided further insight on the understanding of treatment effects, but due to the conditional nature of 
these endpoints, there remains considerable unclarity on how the results are to be interpreted. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP considers that it is very unlikely that the B/R assessment will be impacted. 
The issue was therefore not further pursued by the CHMP.  
The MAH initially specified that in the time-to-event analyses data were censored at end of the 
analysed period (Day 14, Day 28). However, the MAH should have specified the censoring strategy for 
each time to event analysis, for example in the analysis of ‘Time to hospital discharge’ how were 
patients who died before Day 28 handled and how were data censored for withdrawals and dropouts. 
Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH explained that number at risk of patients in each group at day 
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 will be provided at the bottom of all survival curves as well as standard 
output from time-to-event analysis, such as median time to event or equivalent in the final CSR that 
will be submitted by End of December 2021 via a type II variation. This was accepted by the CHMP. 
The estimation of the effect of the intervention in the outcomes was performed in accordance with the 
a priori statistical plan. In addition, due to the strong link between disease severity and use of 
dexamethasone, some uncertainty was raised on whether the effect of anakinra may be related to 
dexamethasone use. Upon request from the CHMP, a subgroup analysis for patients receiving or not 
receiving dexamethasone was provided. The magnitude of the effect was different in these subgroups 
but in both, anakinra had a beneficial effect independently of the administration of dexamethasone. In 
addition, for all analyses, the estimated treatment effect was adjusted for a potential effect of 
dexamethasone.  
Study participants 
Eligible patients were hospitalised patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, LRTI based on chest X-ray or 
computed tomography of the chest, and suPAR level ≥ 6 ng/ml.  
Although eligible patients were hospitalised, hospitalisation is not included in the proposed wording of 
the therapeutic indication. This has been endorsed by the CHMP as the requirement for supplemental 
oxygen (low- or high-flow) usually required an hospital setting/hospitalisation.  
The included population had suPAR of median (IQR) 7.6 ng/ml (6.9-9.1). Hence, anakinra was not 
studied in patients with a suPAR level < 6 ng/ml. Nevertheless, the indication that was initially 
proposed by the MAH did not restrict the use of anakinra in patients with a suPAR level ≥ 6 ng/ml. The 
MAH was therefore requested to further justify the proposed indication regardless of suPAR level. The 
MAH argued that patients with suPAR below 6 ng/ml are likely to benefit from treatment, however, this 
was not documented nor sufficiently justified, as no data in subjects with suPAR < 6 ng/ml have been 
provided. Therefore, in the absence of clinical efficacy established in patients with suPAR level < 6 
Assessment report

ng/ml, the indication was ultimately restricted to patient with suPAR ≥ 6 ng/ml. This has been 
adequately reflected in SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1.  
There are some well-known risk factors for progression of the disease e.g. advanced age or COPD. 
However, not all of the included patients had such systemic comorbidities (39% placebo group 43% 
anakinra group). Nevertheless, this was not considered to be an issue as patients with moderate to 
severe COVID-19 pneumonia (WHO classification) are expected already to be at risk of progression to 
severe respiratory failure.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the single pivotal phase 3 SAVE-MORE study, a total of 1060 patients were screened from December 
2020 through March 2021, and 606 patients were enrolled at 37 study sites (29 in Greece and 8 in 
Italy). 194 patients were allocated to the placebo+SoC arm, and 412 patients were allocated to the 
anakinra+SoC arm. 12 patients withdrew consent and requested the removal of all data, leaving a final 
intention-to-treat (ITT/FAS) analysis set of 594 patients with 189 patients in the placebo+SoC arm and 
405 patients in the anakinra+SoC arm. 1 patient allocated to the placebo+SoC arm was reported as 
lost to follow-up. Except for one sensitivity analysis all analyses were made on the ITT population. The 
PP population consisted of: SoC + placebo= 162 patients; SoC + anakinra= 292 patients. 
Baseline characteristics and disease severity 
Slightly more patients in the placebo arm had severe pneumonia at the start of the treatment than in 
the anakinra group (93.7% vs 90.4%, respectively). In addition, slightly more patients in the placebo 
arm needed high flow oxygen and the P/F ratio was slightly lower at baseline than in the anakinra 
group. The MAH considered that the allocation of patients with severe COVID-19 was similar between 
the two arms despite the numeric differences observed. The CHMP did not fully agree with the MAH as 
the inability to exclude that this distribution could happen by chance is not synonymous of having 
equivalent or similar groups. Further, the differences in baseline disease severity could potentially 
impact on differences in disease severity at day 28 in favour of the investigative drug. However, the 
CHMP considered that severe COVID-19 by WHO were taken in account in the multivariate analysis 
and that the identified imbalance at baseline on signs of pneumonia, is expected to be correlated and 
to overall counterbalance potential bias on this regard.  
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Chronic heart failure, Chronic renal disease, Chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, Coronary heart disease and Atrial fibrillation were well balanced between treatment arms.  
Viral load in blood measured as copies of SARS-CoV-2 gene was equal in both groups. The MAH did not 
provide data or analyses on variants and argued that the hyperinflammatory consequences would 
remain the same, which is agreed and acceptable by the CHMP.  
Information on baseline characteristics and disease severity were adequately reflected into SmPC 
section 5.1, as requested by CHMP. 
Co-administered medication 
A marginally higher proportion in the anakinra arm received remdesivir, whereas the opposite was the 
case for dexamethasone at enrolment. In addition, there were more patients that received antibiotics 
in the placebo arm. This possibly reflects that more patients in the placebo arm had severe 
pneumonia. Overall, baseline medications were well balanced between arms. There were no relevant 
changes in SOC or temporal trends in the prescription of remdesivir as SOC. The MAH also provided 
univariate and multivariate analyses for the primary endpoint including treatment with remdesivir as a 
covariate, which did not show any modification of anakinra effect by remdesivir use. This is agreed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 63/133 
 
 
 
Further, data from patients not treated with dexamethasone suggest that anakinra effect is not 
dependent on whether this was included in the SoC or not, as discussed above. 
During the study, proportionally more patients received noradrenaline and propofol in the placebo arm. 
In addition, more patients in the placebo arm received furosemide than in the anakinra arm (19.6% vs 
10.9%, respectively). It is agreed that this most likely reflects that worsening into SRF occurred more 
often in the placebo arm. The remaining relevant co-administered drugs provided upon request from 
the CHMP were equally distributed across treatment arms. 
Primary endpoint 
The pre-specified primary endpoint was the comparative 11-point WHO-CPS between the two arms of 
treatment; and was expressed as the OR for allocation to lower severity after anakinra treatment 
compared to placebo at day 28 in the FAS population. This was assessed by ordinal regression analysis 
unadjusted and adjusted for other factors (administration of dexamethasone, severe COVID-19, 
BMI>30kg/m2 and country). The adjusted (multivariate) analysis anakinra+SoC was also beneficial 
(OR 0.36; 95 % CI 0.26 to 0.50; P<0.001), hence the primary endpoint was met and considered to be 
statistically significant. The unadjusted OR at Day 28 was 0.36 (95 % CI 0.26 to 0.49; P<0.001). 
In addition, five sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were performed. The first four sensitivity 
analyses were univariate and multivariate ordinal regression analyses of the primary study outcome 
(WHO-CPS) at Day 28 in e.g. the PP population. It is acknowledged that the first four sensitivity 
analysis on the primary endpoint were in favour of anakinra and did support the primary endpoint. The 
fifth sensitivity analysis showed the impact on the estimated treatment effect when adjusting for 
stratifying factors.  
Three analyses of the primary endpoint were also made and supported the clinical benefit of anakinra 
treatment, though p-values were nominal as no hierarchy for analyses beside primary endpoint was 
predefined. In a multivariate logistic regression model of the WHO-CPS of 0 or ≥1 (the first spectrum) 
anakinra was protective (OR: 0.36; 95 % CI 0.25 to 0.53; P<0.001). The same was present when (the 
second spectrum) patients were divided into WHO-CPS ≥ 6 or ≤ 5 (OR: 0.46; 95 % CI 0.26 to 0.83; P: 
0.010). Lastly, Kaplan Meier curve of time to progression to SRF illustrate an inhibitory effect of 
anakinra. Curves start to separate from approximately Day 3 and stay more or less parallel from Day 8 
and onwards. Overall, the direction of anakinra effect was the same in all the analyses and therefore 
supportive of anakinra benefit. Further, an important post hoc analysis (not controlled for multiplicity) 
regarding time to death was made and showed that anakinra treatment reduced the mortality 
compared to placebo (HR: 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.98, P=0.045). 6.9% of patients in the placebo+SoC 
group and 3.2% of patients in the anakinra+SoC group died by Day 28. Separation of the survival 
curve occurred approximately from day 5.   
As discussed, the MAH clarified that SoC did not change in the study period. The additive effect of 
dexamethasone is insignificant in the presence on anakinra (in the multivariable ordinal regression 
analysis), and so is the additive effect of remdesivir. 
Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH also provided on treatment effects using the originally proposed 
primary endpoint; the comparative incidence of SRF between the two arms of treatment by day 14 as 
measured by the 11-point WHO-CPS scale. Patients dying before study visit of day 14 were considered 
achieving the primary endpoint. SRF was defined as clinical progression into hypoxemia with pO2/FiO2 
<150 mmHg necessitating MV or NIV or ECMO. Univariate and multivariate stepwise analyses of the 
incidence and time to SRF progression at Day 14 were performed. In both analyses, anakinra 
treatment prevented the progression to SRF by Day 14. The adjusted OR for the incidence of SRF by 
Day 14 is 0.59 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.89), and this is consistent with the analysis using the ordinal WHO-
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 64/133 
 
 
 
CPS scale at Day 14 (adjusted OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.79). Overall, the CHMP agreed that the 
results presented by the MAH were in favour of anakinra and supported the primary endpoint.  
Secondary endpoints 
Several analyses (absolute and relative change in WHO CPS at days 14 and 28, SOFA score at days 7 
and 14, suPAR at days 4 and 7 and others) were included as secondary endpoints. It is agreed that 
results are supportive of anakinra+SoC treatment. The decrease of the WHO-CPS score from baseline 
to Days 14 and 28 were significantly greater in the anakinra+SoC arm compared to the placebo+SoC 
arm. However, the value of an absolute decrease of 1 additional point (4 points instead of 3 points) in 
the WHO-CPS can be discussed; and is dependent on where in the scale the decrease occurs. 
Regarding the absolute and relative change of the WHO-CPS at day 14 from baseline Day 1, results 
were also in favour of anakinra.   
A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the time until hospital discharge was 1 day shorter 
in the anakinra+SoC group than in the placebo+SoC group (HR: 1.21; 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.45; 
P=0.042). However, the clinical importance of one day shorter for hospitalisation could be questioned. 
Time until discharge from ICU is significantly shorter in the anakinra arm, however some clarity 
regarding censoring was lacking. As this is a secondary endpoint and those are regarded as only 
supportive, this issue was not further pursued by the CHMP.  
suPAR, CRP and IL-6 variation between baseline and days 4 and 7 showed a significantly larger 
decrease in anakinra + placebo when compared to SOC + placebo. However, the other biomarkers 
analysed such as ferritin and D-dimer did not show the same differences. While this information is 
considered to be relevant and supportive of the proposed mechanism of anakinra benefit, with an 
effect in decreasing inflammatory response, it should also be noticed that correlation with clinical 
improvement is not shown. Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH discussed the possibility to use 
biomarkers to guide an early stop of anakinra therapy. Nevertheless, it is agreed that the available 
data is insufficient to draw any conclusion and that additional prospective data would be necessary to 
validate any kind of stopping rule based on decreases in biomarkers Day 4 and 7.  
Special populations 
Three subgroups were analysed: females and males; suPAR above 9 ng/ml or at 9 ng/ml or below; and 
Charlson’s Comorbidity Index (CCI) <2 or ≥2. There were significant results in favour of anakinra in all 
the subgroups. There were minimal differences between females and males; suPAR above 9 ng/mL or 
at 9 ng/mL or below; Charlson’s Comorbidity Index (CCI) <2 or ≥2.  About half of the included 
patients were above 65 years of age. In both patients below and above 65 years of age, the primary 
endpoint was met with OR in the multivariate analysis of 0.29 (0.18-0.44) and 0.39 (0.24-0.64), 
respectively. This information has been adequately reflected in SmPC section 4.4.  
No paediatric pharmacokinetic or clinical data are available as this medicinal product is not 
recommended for use in paediatric patients with COVID-19.  
Supportive study 
The phase 2 SAVE study is an ongoing, prospective, open-label, single-arm study. Eligible patients in 
the SAVE study were the same as the patient population in the SAVE-MORE study (i.e., males and 
females ≥18 years of age hospitalized with confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus, LRTI 
[radiologically confirmed], and plasma suPAR levels ≥6 ng/mL). Patients were included in two periods.  
In the first period, 130 patients were included in the study and treated with anakinra+SoC and 
compared to a propensity matched control group of 130 patients receiving SoC treatment (in the same 
period and at same centers). Results were in benefit for anakinra. In the second period, parallel SoC-

treated patients and anakinra+SoC-treated patients (117 and 525 patients, respectively) were 
included. The incidence of SRF among the parallel SoC-treated patients was significantly greater 
compared to the patients treated with anakinra. As the study has a single arm open label study design, 
the results should be interpreted with caution and can thus only be considered as supportive by the 
CHMP. 
Additional studies with anakinra in the treatment of COVID-19  
Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH presented results from published papers of three other 
completed randomized studies with anakinra conducted by academia (CORIMUNO-ANA-1, REMAP-CAP 
and COV-AID).  
CORIMUNO-ANA-1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study of 116 patients with moderate 
COVID-19 pneumonia (requiring min 3 L/min, WHO-CPS at 5) which was stopped prematurely because 
of an absence of effect of anakinra. In this study anakinra did not improve survival or need for MV or 
NIV (primary endpoints). The inclusion criteria and the studied population differed only slightly from 
the SAVE-MORE study (higher inflammatory markers, fewer received dexamethasone and levels of 
suPAR were unknown). The MAH argued that there was a tendency towards a positive benefit of 
anakinra, however, this was based on minor differences in the subgroups of the CPS score. Due to the 
differences in study population, comparisons between the two studies (CORIMUNO-ANA-1 vs SAVE-
MORE) are difficult.  
REMAP-CAP studied critically ill patients at baseline, that already had progressed to require intensive 
care, respiratory and/or cardiovascular support. There was no effect of anakinra compared with 
standard of care in this patient population. Although the study had an open label design, the results 
may indicate that the time window for the treatment of anakinra is of utmost importance.  
COV-AID was a multicentre, open-label, randomized clinical trial with factorial design that allocated 
112 patients for IL-1 blockade with anakinra. The study design had important differences when 
compared to SAVE-MORE, e.g. the median PaO2/FiO2 ratio at day of randomisation was 135, a value 
that would exclude an important part of the patients of SAVE-MORE. Also, patients already under NIV 
or MV could be included in COV-AID but not in SAVE-MORE, as patients on NIV other than HFNO and 
on MV were excluded in SAVE-MORE. Those are fundamental differences in the populations studied 
that make comparability of these studies difficult. Nonetheless, in COV-AID, no evidence for a 
treatment effect of IL-1 blockade could be found when analysing both primary and secondary 
endpoints and also no differences were apparent in the subgroup analysis. 
Further, the MAH presented the results of three published meta-analysis including both observational 
and RCT data of anakinra use in COVID-19. All the metanalyses seem to support a beneficial effect for 
anakinra, however it should be stressed that all included studies with heterogeneous designs, different 
populations, different SoC, and different anakinra dosing schedules. Therefore, those meta-analyses as 
well as the RCTs presented above cannot be considered as supportive of anakinra for the treatment of 
COVID-19 and as such cannot be used as compelling evidence for the broad indication that was 
primarily sought by the MAH.  
Overall, the MAH presented a thorough review of the available evidence about the use of anakinra in 
COVID-19 upon request from the CHMP. The evidence presented, particularly in the other RCTs, had 
contradictory results and did not provide robust support. It is acknowledged that the RCTs showing no 
effect included populations with substantial differences when compared with SAVE-MORE. Nonetheless, 
these discrepancies underline that patient selection is of utmost importance and that anakinra potential 
beneficial effects depend both on the type of patients selected and the timing of treatment initiation 
guided by suPAR level ≥ 6 ng/ml.  
Assessment report

Therapeutic indication  
The indication initially proposed by the MAH was as follows: Kineret is indicated for the treatment of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult patients with pneumonia who are at risk of developing 
severe respiratory failure (see section 5.1). 
As also discussed above, this broad indication was not supported by the CHMP as it was considered not 
sufficiently justified from a scientific viewpoint in view of the population studied in the single pivotal 
phase 3 SAVE-MORE study supporting this application.  
Patients who did not require supplemental oxygen were also included in the study. Upon request from 
the CHMP, the MAH provided subgroup analyses based on supplemental oxygen at screening during 
the study. However, the results in those who were not treated with supplemental oxygen at screening 
were not clinically relevant, and it is therefore agreed that the indication should be restricted to 
patients requiring supplemental oxygen, as proposed by the MAH. In addition, the MAH was requested 
to reflect the level of oxygen needed in the indication (i.e. low- or high- flow oxygen) as patients under 
MV or NIV or ECMO were not studied. Clinical efficacy has therefore not been established in those more 
severe patients. This has been adequately reflected in both SmPC sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1.  
As the majority of the patients received corticosteroids (81.8%), the MAH was requested to further 
justify the efficacy of anakinra in patients not receiving corticosteroids. In a subgroup analysis focusing 
on patients that did not receive dexamethasone at baseline and during the study indicated that 
anakinra effect is not dependent on co-treatment with dexamethasone. Although the sample size was 
small and most of the patients in the SAVE-MORE study were under dexamethasone treatment, the 
CHMP ultimately considered that anakinra has shown benefit with or without corticosteroids.  
The indication initially proposed by the MAH did not restrict the use of anakinra in COVID-19 to 
patients with a suPAR level ≥ 6 ng/ml. However, anakinra was not studied in patients with a suPAR 
level < 6 ng/ml and it is noted that 405 out of 1060 screened patients were excluded due to a suPAR 
below 6 ng/ml. Further, based on the responses submitted by the MAH, the CHMP concluded that an 
efficacy was not established in patients with suPAR level below 6 ng/ml. As such, the CHMP considered 
that only patients with suPAR level ≥6 ng/ml should be treated with anakinra as an efficacy was only 
demonstrated in those patients (i.e. suPAR ≥6 ng/ml).  
Further, the inclusion of patients with suPAR level ≥ 6 ng/ml was chosen to identify a patient 
population in risk of disease progression to SRF. Based on a potential limited availability of suPAR 
testing in the EU, the MAH was requested to investigate whether other well-established biomarkers 
could identify a relevant target population. In a post-hoc analysis, the MAH tried to identify other 
biomarkers associated with progression to SRF (e.g. CRP, ferritin, IL-6 and D-dimer) and proposed a 
score for progression based on those biomarkers i.e. the SCOPE score. Based on this post-hoc 
analysis, the MAH initially stated in the SmPC section 5.1. that in the absence of suPAR, other 
biomarkers of inflammation (e.g. CRP, ferritin, IL-6, D-dimers, LDH) could provide similar clinical 
information. However, the SCOPE score only partly overlaps with patients identified with suPAR ≥6 
ng/ml. The CHMP therefore considered that the SCOPE score did not identify the same patients at risk 
as suPAR does. As such, the SCOPE score was not considered as a valid tool to identify patients that 
may benefit from treatment with anakinra. Based on this, the MAH agreed to remove any claim 
referring to the SCOPE score in SmPC section 5.1.  
Considering the decisive role of suPAR for the identification of patients that are suitable for treatment 
with anakinra in COVID-19 pneumonia, the MAH should ensure that an appropriate and validated test 
that reliably allows the distinction between patients with suPAR < 6 ng/ml and patients with suPAR ≥ 6 
ng/ml is available for all European patients. Such test should be adequately CE-marked as a 
companion diagnostic under the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation framework.  
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 67/133 
 
 
 
Overall, the CHMP considered that the initially proposed indication did not fully reflect the patient 
population studied in the pivotal phase 3 SAVE-MORE study. Further, in the absence of a robust 
justification to extrapolate the indication to patients regardless of suPAR level, the CHMP considered 
that the indication should be restricted to the population of patients where a positive benefit/risk 
balance has been demonstrated i.e. suPAR level ≥ 6 ng / ml.  
The final indication granted by the CHMP was thus restricted as follows: Kineret is indicated for the 
treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult patients with pneumonia requiring 
supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory 
failure determined by plasma concentration of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor 
(suPAR) ≥ 6ng/ml (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
In SmPC section 4.4 the following was consequently included: ‘The effect of treatment with Kineret has 
not been established in COVID-19 patients with suPAR < 6 ng/ml.’; and ‘Kineret treatment should not 
be initiated in patients requiring non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as efficacy has not been established in these patient populations.’. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The single pivotal phase 3 SAVE-MORE study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically 
significant reduction in the 11-point WHO-CPS score. In addition, the study demonstrated that 
anakinra + SoC treatment had a beneficial effect on time to progression to severe respiratory failure, 
on time until hospital discharge and on mortality, as compared to placebo +SoC treatment. Based on 
the data submitted, the CHMP considered that a clinically relevant efficacy was only demonstrated in 
COVID-19 patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) who are 
at risk of progressing to SRF determined by suPAR ≥ 6ng/ml.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
As part of this application, the MAH proposed to add a new indication in COVID-19 pneumonia, where 
anakinra is administered as a daily s.c. injection at a dose of 100 mg for up to 10 days of treatment.  
The safety profile of anakinra has been well established since its first use in company-sponsored 
studies and during almost 20 years of post-marketing experience across multiple indications.  
The safety of anakinra in the proposed COVID-19 indication and dosing regimen was studied in 2 
investigator-sponsored studies (SAVE-MORE and SAVE). The MAH provided safety data from the 
following sources: 
-Primary safety data set: pivotal phase 3 SAVE-MORE study. 
-Supportive safety data from: 
- The open-label, single-arm phase 2 SAVE study. 
- Company-sponsored Phase 2/3, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 3-arm, multicenter 
study (Sobi.IMMUNO-101). 
- Post marketing cumulative safety data with off-label use in COVID-19, including spontaneous 
(health care providers and consumers) and literature reports, including safety data from other Sobi-
supported studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 68/133 
 
 
 
- Relevant findings from literature searches in PubMed and EMBASE performed to identify 
aggregated data from off-label use in COVID-19. 
As part of their application, the MAH initially submitted information pertaining to TEAEs, serious TEAS, 
and aggregated data on laboratory values, medical history, and concomitant medications from the 
SAVE-MORE study (analysis of Day 28 only).  
Patients in the phase 2 SAVE study were enrolled during 2 time periods (April to September 2020 and 
October to December 2020), considering the available SoC treatment that was recommended by the 
WHO for patients with COVID-19 before and after mid-September 2020. This included, for patients 
classified with moderate disease, anticoagulation and remdesivir (based on medical judgment) and, for 
patients classified with severe disease, anticoagulation, oxygen supply, dexamethasone, and 
remdesivir (based on medical judgment). Similarly, the SoC treatment was administered to all patients 
of the SAVE-MORE Phase 3 study. In both time periods of the phase 2 SAVE study, patients with 
COVID-19 who were concurrently treated with SoC alone were used as parallel SoC comparators; 
these parallel SoC comparators were hospitalized during the same time period. TEAE and serious 
TEAEs were reported, and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (Version 4.03) was 
used for the classification of the events. 
Interim safety data up to 14-day follow-up of 130 patients from the SAVE study from the 1st period 
(April to September 2020) have been published by Kyriazopoulou et al. 2021. 
MAH-sponsored, Phase 2/3, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, 3-arm, multicenter study 
(Sobi.IMMUNO-101) was also initiated to investigate the efficacy and safety of anakinra and 
emapalumab versus SoC in reducing hyperinflammation and respiratory distress in patients with SARS-
CoV-2 infection. Only 16 patients were randomized due to a premature closure of the enrolment in the 
study. Safety data related to the TEAEs, serious TEAEs, laboratory values, and vital sign results were 
collected and reported with the study report. 
Summaries of TEAEs experienced by patients in studies SAVE-MORE, SAVE, and Sobi.IMMUNO-101 
were presented sequentially for each category as common TEAEs, deaths, other serious TEAEs, other 
significant TEAEs, and analysis of TEAEs.  
In addition, a search in the MAH’s Global Safety Database was performed to retrieve all SAEs involving 
anakinra use in the SAVE-MORE study received after unblinding. Evaluation of SAEs, fatal and life-
threatening case reports, serious infections, hepatic events, and Designated medical event (DME) 
summaries, in addition to an overall medical assessment of all case reports was performed. Of note, 
discrepancies in SAEs can be seen between the MAH’s analysis and SAVE-MORE CSR, as no 
reconciliation has been performed yet. The MedDRA coding of SAEs was provided by the MAH as 
requested by the CHMP. In addition, the SAVE-MORE interim CSR presented serious TEAEs up to Day 
28 whereas the Global Safety Database analysis is based on SAEs collected up to Day 28 and beyond. 
The final CSR for the SAVE-MORE study will be submitted in the post approval setting via a type II 
variation by End of December 2021. In addition, the CHMP recommends the MAH to provide the final 
CSR of the phase 2 SAVE study, once available. 
Considering the lack of standardization between the different studies, it was not possible to pool or 
directly compare the TEAE frequencies. A high-level view of the data, however, indicated that the TEAE 
pattern was similar between the SAVE-MORE and SAVE studies and was primarily suggestive of the 
underlying disease and its complications. 
Sobi.IMMUNO-101 study data were inconclusive due to a low patient number; the safety data are 
presented below.

Solicited SAEs from ISSs including the SAVE-MORE study are presented together with the COVID-19 
off-label use data. 
Patient exposure 
As of May 1, 2021, the estimated exposure to anakinra in completed, company-sponsored, clinical 
studies (encompassing all studied indications, excluding Sobi.IMMUNO-101 study) was 6,408 patient-
years in 8,631 patients. 
Pivotal SAVE-MORE study 
In the SAVE-MORE study, 594 hospitalized patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 pneumonia 
and plasma suPAR of ≥6 ng/mL or more and receiving SoC were randomized 1:2 to s.c. treatment with 
placebo or 100 mg anakinra once daily for 10 days; 194 patients were allocated to the placebo+SoC 
arm and 412 patients were allocated to the anakinra+SoC arm. Following the consent withdrawal from 
12 patients, 189 patients received the allocated placebo+SoC treatment, and 405 patients received the 
allocated anakinra+SoC treatment. The mean number of administered doses of study drug for all the 
patients was 8.6. The mean number of administered doses was similar for both the treatment arms 
(placebo+SoC [8.7]; anakinra+SoC [8.4]). Upon request from the CHMP, updated safety data were 
provided up to Day 90. 
Supportive studies 
The analysis of the 1st period of the SAVE study was based on 130 anakinra-treated patients and 130 
parallel SoC comparators (hospitalized the same time period at different departments). The 1st patient 
was enrolled on April 16, 2020 and the last on September 12, 2020. During the 2nd period of SAVE 
study (October to December 2020), 587 patients were enrolled for the treatment with anakinra in 
parallel with 141 patients treated with SoC. In both periods, COVID-19 patients who were concurrently 
treated with SoC alone were used as parallel SoC comparators. The treatment duration was up to 10 
days during both periods.  
A total of 16 patients completed screening and were enrolled in the Sobi.IMMUNO-101study. 5 patients 
received treatment with emapalumab, 5 patients received treatment with anakinra, and 6 patients 
received SoC. 12 patients (75%) completed the study, and 4 patients (25%) discontinued the study. 
The major reasons for early study discontinuation were death (1 patient each in the emapalumab and 
anakinra arms), TEAE (1 patient in the emapalumab arm), and lack of efficacy (1 patient in the SoC 
arm). 
Demographic and other characteristics of study population 
Pivotal SAVE-MORE study 
The patients had a mean (SD) age of 61.9 years (12.1), with a similar distribution between treatment 
groups (placebo+SoC [61.5 years]; anakinra+SoC [62.0 years]). The distribution by sex was balanced 
between treatment groups, with the male sex accounting for 57.1% in placebo+SoC arm and 58.3% in 
anakinra+SoC arm. A total of 27 patients (14.3%) with moderate pneumonia and 162 patients 
(85.7%) with severe pneumonia received placebo+SoC treatment; 82 patients (20.2%) with moderate 
pneumonia and 323 patients (79.8%) with severe pneumonia received anakinra+SoC treatment.

Supportive studies 
In the SAVE study a total of 130 patients were enrolled during the 1st period and 130 parallel SOC 
comparators were identified after the propensity score matching within the same time frame. Overall, 
62.3% patients in the anakinra+SoC arm and 64.8% patients in the SoC group were male, and the 
mean (SD) age was 63 (14) years in the anakinra+SoC arm and 66 (14) years in the SoC group. A 
total of 587 patients were enrolled during the 2nd period. When the results of the 1st period analysis 
of the SAVE study were announced, most of the medical departments managing patients with COVID-
19 decided to join the study, which led to the 2nd protocol amendment (Version 3.0). This led to 
substantial reduction of the available parallel SoC comparators to only 141. No propensity score 
matching was done because the available comparators were far fewer than the treated patients. 
Overall, 59.8 % patients in the SoC group and 64.1% in the anakinra+SoC arm were male, and the 
mean (SD) age was 64.3 (14.6) years in the SoC group and 61.8 (13.2) years in the anakinra+SoC 
arm. Differences were observed between the 2 groups regarding the severity of COVID-19 and a few 
other baseline characteristics that includes Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and ceftaroline 
treatment. 
In the Sobi.IMMUNO-101 study, all 16 patients that were randomized and treated were included in the 
safety population and in the modified intent-to-treat population. The patients had a similar distribution 
of the demographic and baseline characteristics in the safety population, with a mean (SD) age of 65 
(14.8) years in emapalumab group, 62.4 (11.1) years in anakinra group, and 62.5 (13.4) years in SoC 
group and most patients were male (4 patients [80%] in emapalumab group, 4 patients [80%] in 
anakinra group, and 6 patients [100%] in SoC group).

Adverse events 
The most common events reported overall with the primary safety data set were increased liver 
function tests, hyperglycaemia, and anaemia, along with other reported electrolyte abnormalities.  
Although a consistent terminology was not presented across all safety results, a similar safety profile 
of anakinra was observed in the supportive SAVE study (both periods), which included elevated liver 
function tests, electrolyte abnormalities, and anaemia as the most commonly reported TEAEs. 
Pivotal SAVE-MORE study 
Overall, 170 (89.9%) patients treated with placebo+SoC and 352 (86.9%) patients treated with 
anakinra+SoC experienced at least one non-serious TEAE (see table below). The TEAEs occurring at a 
higher proportion in the anakinra+SoC arm compared to the placebo+SoC arm included the increase of 
liver function tests, hypernatremia, constipation, hyperkalemia, anxiety, rash at the injection site, 
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Of these, the increase of liver function tests (hepatic enzyme 
increased), rash at the injection site (injection site reaction), neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are 
listed ADRs in the anakinra product information. The most frequent events overall were 
hyperglycaemia, increase of liver function tests, anaemia, and hypernatremia. The TEAEs reported in 
the majority of patients were suggestive of advanced COVID-19 and its complications along with the 
worsening of patients’ concurrent clinical conditions.

Table 22: Most common (>2% of patients) non-serious TEAEs by SOC and PT (Safety set) 
Upon request from the CHMP, the SAVE-MORE safety data up to Day 90 was provided, including all 
TEAEs combined, according to investigator causality; most common (>2%) serious and non-serious 
TEAEs; serious and non-serious TEAEs, according to investigator causality; and non-serious TEAEs, 
according to severity. 
Overall, 156 (82.5 %) patients treated with placebo + SoC and 335 (82.7 %) patients treated with 
anakinra + SoC experienced at least 1 TEAE. The TEAEs, excluding single events, occurring at a higher 
proportion in the anakinra + SoC group compared to the placebo + SoC group, included Leukopenia,

Neutropenia, Injection site reaction, Fall, Rash, Nausea, Constipation, Transaminases increased, 
Gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, Alkaline phosphatase increased, Blood pressure decreased, 
Sinus tachycardia, Atrial fibrillation, Anxiety, Agitation, Acute kidney injury, Hyperglycemia, 
Hypernatraemia, Hyperkalaemia, Hypercalcaemia, Hypophosphataemia, Cystitis acute, Epistaxis, Chest 
pain, and Catheter bleeding. Of these, Neutropenia, Rash, Injection site reaction, and Hepatic enzyme 
increased, are listed ADRs in the anakinra product information. Few of these events were serious or led 
to premature treatment discontinuation (3 patients – 1 Leukopenia, 2 Transaminases increased, 
[0.7%] in the anakinra group and 2 patients – 1 Leukopenia, 1 Transaminases increased [1.0%] in the 
placebo group).  
The TEAEs reported in the majority of patients were suggestive of advanced COVID-19 and its 
complications and/or worsening of patients’ concurrent clinical/background condition and concomitant 
medication.  
In the SAVE-MORE study, death was a component of the primary endpoint and in line with the study 
protocol; all deaths were considered by the MAH to be not related to study drug and due to COVID-19 
progression/complications and/or the patient’s concurrent clinical/background condition. A total of 35 
patients (5.9%) in the study had an AE with an outcome of death up to 90 days; 17 patients (9.0%) 
received placebo + SoC and 18 patients (4.4%) received anakinra + SoC. Fatal events were reported 
in the SOCs of Infections and infestations (Bacteraemia, Pneumonia, Septic shock), Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders (Pneumothorax, Pneumomediastinum), and Vascular disorders 
(Arterial thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism).  
Overall, 42 patients (22.2 %) treated with placebo + SoC and 66 patients (16.3 %) treated with 
anakinra + SoC experienced at least 1 serious TEAE. The most frequently reported (>2 %) serious 
TEAEs in both groups were Bacteremia, Nosocomial infection, Pneumonia, Septic shock, and Pulmonary 
embolism. Other serious TEAEs reported at a higher rate in the anakinra + SoC group than in the 
placebo + SoC group and in more than 1 patient were Acute kidney injury, Hypernatraemia, 
Hyponatraemia, and Lymphopenia. 
The serious TEAEs were suggestive of advanced COVID-19 disease and its complications. Pulmonary 
infections, such as HAP/VAP with secondary bacterial infections, Sepsis, thromboembolic conditions, 
Acute kidney injury, electrolyte disturbances and Lymphopenia have been reported as complications of 
COVID-19 during the pandemic and reported in various reports. 
Supportive studies 
SAVE was an open-label study, and no comparison group was available. However, a group of parallel 
comparators receiving SoC treatments at the same period was used. 
TEAEs were collected from baseline up to 14 days of follow-up. Investigators monitored the patients 
for TEAEs and were responsible for recording all TEAEs that occurred during the study.  
The TEAEs captured during the 1st period (April to September 2020) are listed in the below table. The 
incidence of the same events was depicted among parallel SoC comparators. As shown in the table 
below, the number of patients experiencing at least 1 TEAE was similar in the parallel SoC comparators 
(68.5%) compared to the anakinra+SoC arm (65.4%). The TEAEs occurring at numerically higher 
proportion of patients in the anakinra+SoC arm compared to the parallel SoC comparators were 
gastrointestinal disturbances (11.5% versus 6.9%), leukopenia (8.5% versus 2.3%); thrombopenia 
(6.9% versus 5.4%), and headache (3.1% versus 1.5%), respectively. Of these events, leukopenia 
(neutropenia), thrombocytopenia, and headache are expected with anakinra treatment; however, 
these are also observed in COVID-19 infected patients. In addition, gastrointestinal disturbances are 
known to occur in COVID-19 patients, and although they were observed at a higher rate in the 
Assessment report

anakinra+SoC arm, they are most likely due to the underlying COVID-19 medical condition in these 
patients. 
Table 23: Treatment-emergent adverse events reported in the SAVE study (1st period – April to 
September 2020) 
Safety analysis was performed up to Day 14 for all 587 patients who were enrolled in the SAVE study 
during the 2nd period of October to December 2020. For reasons of comparison, the frequency of the 
same events was captured for all 141 patients who received SoC. The proportion of TEAEs in the 
anakinra group was lower than the SoC comparators for anaemia and any heart arrhythmia, and 
similar to that of the SoC comparators for thrombopenia, headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, 
electrolyte abnormalities, leukopenia, and allergic reactions, except for elevated liver function tests 
that were reported at a higher proportion in the anakinra group (43.8%) than in the SoC comparators 
group (36.9%) .

The list of AEs captured until Day 90 follow-up are included in the table below for the 717 patients 
enrolled in SAVE and 271 comparators. 
In the SAVE study, fatal events were all attributed to infections – either COVID-19 or secondary infections 
– by investigators. 
There were relatively fewer deaths in anakinra-treated patients than comparators in the SAVE study up 
to Day 90 follow-up. Deaths due to underlying COVID-19 and secondary infections were both reported 
less frequently in the anakinra group than in the comparator group, as were other SAEs (infectious, 
renal, and vascular). Regarding non-serious AEs, increased transaminases, injection site rash, 
leukopenia, and nausea were more frequently reported in anakinra-treated patients than comparators. 
Given the non-randomized nature of the study, detailed analysis of the AE pattern is not feasible, but 
the data is compatible with the known safety profile of anakinra.  
Overall, the review of TEAEs in SAVE MORE and SAVE up to Day 90 follow-up did not indicate any new 
safety signal identified with anakinra treatment in COVID-19, and indicated that the safety profile is 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 76/133 
 
 
 
 
consistent with current approved product information, taking the underlying disease, dose, and 
duration of anakinra treatment in the studies into account. 
In the Sobi.IMMUNO-101 study, 7 out of 16 patients experienced TEAEs in the safety population: 2 
patients (40.0%) in the anakinra group, 4 patients (80.0%) in the emapalumab group, and 1 patient 
(16.7%) in the SoC group (see table 23). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 1 patient in each 
treatment group and included thrombocytopenia (1 patient [20.0%] in the anakinra group), atrial 
fibrillation (1 patient [20.0%] in the emapalumab group), hypertransaminasemia (1 patient [16.7%] in 
the SoC group). 
Severe TEAEs were reported in 1 patient (20.0%) in the anakinra group and 2 patients (40.0%) in the 
emapalumab group each with SRF. No patients in the SoC group experienced a severe TEAE (see table 
24). The most common TEAE by preferred term was respiratory failure (1 patient [20.0%] in the 
anakinra group and 2 patients [40.0%] in the emapalumab group). All other TEAE PTs were reported 
in single patients in each treatment group during this study.

Table 26: Serious TEAEs by SOC and PT (Safety population) 
The Safety Data from the SAVE-MORE study was provided up to Day 90. TEAEs occurring at a higher 
proportion on the anakinra+SoC group included:

-  Leukopenia, neutropenia, injection site reaction, fall, rash, nausea, increase of transaminases, γ-GT 
and alkaline phosphatase, blood pressure decreased, sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, anxiety, 
agitation, acute kidney injury, hyperglycaemia, hypernatremia, hyperkalaemia, hypercalcemia, 
hypophosphatemia, cystitis, acute epistaxis, chest pain and catheter bleeding. 
Already included in Kineret’s SmPC are neutropenia, rash, injection site reaction and increased hepatic 
transaminases. According with the MAH the TEAEs reported in the majority of patients were suggestive 
of advanced COVID-19 and its complications and/or worsening of patients’ concurrent 
clinical/background condition and concomitant medication; the same conclusion was adopted related 
with serious TEAEs. 
To date the serious TEAEs reported can indeed be related to progression of COVID-19 infection. 
The MAH has updated section 4.8 of the SmPC to include D90 data on safety:  
“Adverse reactions data in COVID-19 are based on a randomized placebo-controlled study of 405 
Kineret-treated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (SAVE-MORE study). The incidence of serious 
adverse reactions in the anakinra-treatment group was comparable with the placebo group. 
Neutropenia, elevation of liver function test, rash and injection site reactions were reported more 
frequently in patients receiving Kineret compared with placebo. The overall safety profile in patients 
with COVID-19 treated with Kineret is similar to that in Kineret-treated patients with RA.” 
“In the clinical study in COVID-19, secondary serious infections were common, however less frequently 
observed in patients treated with Kineret compared to placebo-treated patients.” 
“In the clinical study in COVID-19, events of neutropenia were reported in 3.0% of Kineret-treated 
patients and 0.5% of patients receiving placebo. All adverse events of neutropenia were mild or 
moderate in severity.” 
“In patients with COVID-19 treated with Kineret, injection site reactions were reported with low 
frequency. “ 
Of note, for patients with COVID-19 that were treated with anakinra, injection site reactions (ISR) 
were reported with a frequency higher compared to the placebo treated patients. Nevertheless, the 
frequency of reported ISR in patient that received anakinra was still considered to be low by the MAH. 
Therefore, the addition of the following statement to SmPC section 4.8: ‘In patients with COVID-19 
treated with Kineret, injection site reactions were reported with low frequency’ was agreed by the 
CHMP. 
It is agreed that the data available up to Day 90 follow-up do not indicate any new safety signal 
identified with anakinra treatment in COVID-19, and also indicate that the safety profile is consistent 
with the current labelling, taking the underlying disease, dose, and duration of anakinra treatment in 
the studies into account. 
The SmPC has been updated with the data available to the date. Any new follow up data should be 
provided as part of the final CSR for the SAVE-MORE and SAVE studies. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
The proportion of patients with an outcome of death was lower in the anakinra-treated group than the 
placebo group in the primary SAVE-MORE study and was consistently lower in the anakinra-treated 
group than the comparator group in supportive studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021

Pivotal SAVE-MORE study 
A total of 26 patients (4.3%) in the study experienced an outcome of death, up to 28 days; 13 patients 
(6.9%) received placebo+SoC and 13 patients (3.2%) received anakinra+SoC. All deaths were 
considered to be due to COVID-19 progression and the patient’s concurrent medical conditions that 
were considered the risk factors for COVID-19 and may have contributed to fatal outcomes in these 
patients and considered to be not related to study drug. Secondary bacterial infections including 
associated septic shock and multiorgan failure are known complications of patients with COVID-19 
hospitalized or in ICU and on ventilator respiratory support. Narratives for patients who experienced 
serious TEAEs and all TEAEs with an outcome of death were provided upon request from the CHMP.  
In the SAVE-MORE study, death was a component of the primary endpoint and was excluded from 
reporting as an SAE according to the study protocol. All deaths but 1 were considered by the 
investigator to be not related to study drug and due to COVID-19 progression/complications and/or the 
patient’s concurrent clinical/background condition. A total of 35 patients (5.9 %) in the study had an 
AE with an outcome of death up to 90 days; 17 patients (9.0 %) received placebo + SoC and 18 
patients (4.4 %) received anakinra + SoC. Of the 18 fatal cases in the anakinra arm, 13 were in male 
patients and 5 in female patients. The median age of the patients was 75 years (age band range: 50 to 
89 years). A list of all fatal event PTs is provided in the table below. 
Table 27: Most frequently reported fatal events in the anakinra group in the SAVE-MORE study 
The most frequently reported fatal events (≥2 events) were Septic shock (6 events), Pneumonia (5 
events), Nosocomial infection and Bacteraemia (4 events each), and Acute kidney injury and 
Pneumomediastinum (2 events each). The time to onset of the events occurring in ≥2 patients ranged 
from 1 to 69 days and showed no trend. The cases of arterial thrombosis, pneumothorax, and acute 
pyelonephritis were confounded by concurrent COVID-19 infection and concurrent clinical/background 
condition and/or concomitant medication. The case of abdominal infection had insufficient information 
to assess; however, the patient had medical history of possible intra-abdominal infection reported prior 
to anakinra start.  
In the SAVE-MORE study, the most frequently reported fatal event was septic shock. The second most 
frequently reported fatal event was pneumonia (bacterial or fungal origin). Secondary pneumonia is 
recognized as a complication of severe COVID-19. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of 
infection due to prolonged ICU stays and broad-spectrum antibiotic use. The third most frequently 
reported fatal event was nosocomial infection and bacteraemia. Nosocomial infections were all reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 79/133 
 
 
 
 
as hospital-acquired infections. A recent study found the nosocomial infection rate in the ICU was 
noted to be higher among COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 patients (Ong et al 2021). 
The events of bacteraemia had a median time to onset of 38 days (range: 11 to 69 days). The short 
duration of treatment of anakinra (10 days) along with its short half-life (4 to 6 hours) makes the role 
of anakinra in these cases unlikely. The most likely cause/contributing factor(s) is COVID-19, 
underlying severe clinical condition with possible pneumonia, and central venous catheters and other 
intravascular devices in these patients.   
In the SAVE-MORE study, deaths were mostly attributed to the SOC Infections and infestations, either 
pneumonia (COVID-19 or bacterial superinfection), bacteremia, or septic shock. There were also single 
fatalities attributed to events in the ‘Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders’, and ‘Vascular 
disorders’ SOCs. The spectrum of fatal events was similar between anakinra- and placebo-treated 
patients.  
In summary, all deaths in the SAVE-MORE study on the anakinra arm were considered by the MAH to 
be not related to study drug but related to COVID-19 progression/complications and/or the patient’s 
concurrent clinical/background condition. The MAH performed a thorough review of all anakinra cases 
in the COVID-19 indication and, to date, no new signal/safety concern was identified. 
For the SAVE-MORE study, deaths are provided in the table below (censored at Day 90). 
Supportive studies 
In the SAVE study the proportion of all deaths in the anakinra group was lower than in the comparator 
group for both the 1st period (4.6 % (n=6) in anakinra group and 12.3 % (n=16) in the comparator 
group) and the 2nd period (4.4 % (n=26) in the anakinra group and 14.2 % (n=20) in the comparator 
group). Narratives are not available yet. Those are expected to be provided once the final CSR will be 
ready.  
An updated analysis reporting all deaths up to 90 days of follow-up in the SAVE study is included 
below. The table does not categorize events according to SOC and PT since the events have not been 
MedDRA-coded in the SAVE study.

Table 28: Fatal adverse events captured until day 90 among patients enrolled in SAVE and 
comparators 
In the Sobi.IMMUNO-101study, 1 patient (20.0 %) in the anakinra group and 2 patients (40.0 %) in 
the emapalumab group each experienced a serious TEAE of respiratory failure with a fatal outcome. No 
patients in the SoC group experienced a fatal TEAE. None of the fatal TEAEs was considered related to 
study drug. The patient that experienced a fatal outcome in the anakinra group was 60-69-year-old, 
hospitalized prior to enrolment in the study for interstitial lung pneumonia, secondary to COVID-19.  
Medical history of particular interest included SARS-CoV-2 infection (diagnosed 19 days before 
randomization), interstitial pneumonia, liver disease, and acute hepatitis C. Other relevant medical 
history included cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis C. The patient experienced severe respiratory failure on 
Day 14. 
Other serious adverse events 
The proportion of patients with at least 1 serious TEAE was lower in the anakinra-treated group than in 
the placebo group in the SAVE-MORE study and was consistently lower in the anakinra-treated group 
than in the comparator group in supportive studies. The most frequently reported serious TEAEs in 
both treatment groups in the SAVE-MORE study were VAP, bloodstream infection, probable nosocomial 
infections, and pulmonary embolism. 
Pivotal SAVE-MORE study 
Overall, 40 (21.2%) patients treated with placebo+SoC and 66 (16.3%) patients treated with 
anakinra+SoC experienced at least 1 serious TEAE. The most frequently reported serious TEAEs in 
both arms were VAP, bloodstream infection, probable nosocomial infections, and pulmonary embolism, 
see table below. Other serious TEAEs reported at a higher rate in the anakinra+SoC arm than in the 
placebo+SoC arm were AKI, pneumomediastinum, ischaemic stroke, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, 
increase of liver function tests, neutropenia, and lymphopenia. 
These serious TEAEs were suggestive of advanced COVID-19 disease and its complications. 
Pulmonary infections such as HAP/VAP with secondary bacterial infections, sepsis, and thromboembolic 
conditions have been reported as complications of COVID-19 during the pandemic and reported in 
various reports (i.e., by WHO).

Table 29: Most common (>2% patients) serious TEAEs in the SAVE-MORE study 
Table 30: Most common (>2%) serious TEAEs by SOC and PT (Safety set) 
In the SAVE-MORE study when classified by organ class or syndrome by organ system or syndrome, 
the related TEAEs (as per investigator’s assessment) of hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, 
elevation of liver function tests, constipation, nausea and vomiting, thrombocytosis, leukopenia, 
neutropenia, anxiety, rash, and reaction at injection site were observed more frequently in the 
anakinra+SoC arm than in the placebo+SoC arm. The related TEAEs of hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, 
hyponatremia, hypokalemia, diarrhea, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, headache, and creatinine increase 
were observed more frequently in patients in the placebo+SoC arm than in the anakinra+SoC arm.  
Events of neutropenia, rash, and elevated liver function tests are known ADRs for anakinra; while the 
events of nausea, vomiting, anxiety, hypernatremia, and hyperkalemia are known to occur in 
individuals with COVID-19 infection and are also in accordance with the comorbidities reported in this 
study population. 
The classification by severity of non-serious TEAEs revealed that the majority of TEAEs were 
considered mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in severity. Grade 3 severity TEAEs were infrequent 
and balanced between the 2 arms.  
The distribution of infections and infestations by MedDRA PT is shown in the table below. The distribution 
of the majority of infections is generally lower in the anakinra group than in the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021

Overall, serious infections occurred less frequently in the anakinra + SoC group (9.1%) than in the 
placebo + SoC group (16.9%) in the SAVE-MORE study. The serious events (all causality) within the 
Infections and infestations SOC occurring at a slightly higher frequency in the anakinra + SoC group 
compared to the placebo + SoC group were single cases of diverticulitis, hepatitis B, and skin 
infection; all of which were considered unrelated by the investigator at the time of latest follow-up 
received.  
The table below lists the causative organisms in the anakinra + SoC and placebo + SoC groups. 
Overall, the pattern of secondary infection pathogens was similar between treatment groups, and 
opportunistic agents were observed in both treatment groups.  
The causative organisms occurring at a higher rate in the anakinra + SoC group compared to the 
placebo + SoC group were: Staphylococcus hominis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, 
Escherichia coli, Aspergillus flavus, Candida spp., and Hepatitis B virus.

Table 31: Causative organisms according to treatment group for events of serious infection 
In the SAVE-MORE study, serious infections, including pneumonia as a superinfection, were less 
frequent in the anakinra + SoC group than in the placebo + SoC group. This difference, compared to 
the current approved Kineret label, is not surprising, considering the different clinical setting of chronic 
treatment of ambulatory RA patients compared with hospitalized patients with ongoing viral SARS-
CoV-2 associated pneumonia. In addition, as demonstrated by the efficacy results in the SAVE-MORE 
study, anakinra + SoC treated patients did clinically better overall, which could have contributed to 
fewer secondary infections. The types of infections and the causative micro-organisms reported in the 
SAVE-MORE study were due to gram-negative infections such as A. baumannii, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. Faecalis, which are frequently reported in hospitalized 
patients.  
In conclusion, except for overall less frequent infections in anakinra-treated patients, the anatomic, as 
well as microbiological, patterns were similar between anakinra- and placebo-treated patients and 
appear congruent with the clinical setting. 
In the SAVE-MORE study at Day 28 follow-up, 30 patients (15.9%) allocated to the placebo group 
worsened in clinical course due to infections, compared to 34 patients (8.4%) in the anakinra group 
(p=0.010 by the Fisher exact test), indicating that the incidence of infections aggravating the clinical 
course was lower in the anakinra group than in the placebo group. There were 12 cases of

neutropenia, both serious and non-serious, in the anakinra group. The table below shows the incidence 
of serious infections recorded as SAEs according to the presence of neutropenia. No infectious SAEs 
were recorded among patients developing neutropenia. 
Supportive studies 
In the SAVE study the captured serious TEAEs during the 14 days of the 1st period are presented in 
the table below. 
The number of patients experiencing at least 1 serious TEAEs by Day 14 was higher in the parallel SoC 
comparators group (48.5 %) compared to the anakinra+SoC arm (24.6 %). With the exception of 
pulmonary edema, which occurred in 1 patient in the anakinra+SoC arm, the majority of serious TEAEs 
observed by Day 14 occurred at a higher rate in the parallel SoC comparators group compared to the 
anakinra+SoC arm. 
Table 32: Serious TEAEs reported in the SAVE study (1st period – April to September 2020) 
The captured serious TEAEs during the 14 days of the 2nd period are shown in the table below. 
The incidence of all serious TEAEs in the anakinra group was 18.9% and in the SoC comparators group 
was 39.0%, including shock (anakinra 6.5% and SoC comparators 26.2%), AKI (anakinra 4.4% and 
15.6% SoC comparators), any bacterial infection (anakinra 7.0% and SoC comparators 12.8%), and 
thromboembolic event (anakinra 1.9% and SoC comparators 2.8%).

Table 33: Serious TEAE reported in SAVE study (2nd period – October to December 2020) 
Data analysis of adverse events by organ system or syndrome in the SAVE study are not available yet 
(those are expected to be provided once available). 
In the SAVE study, serious infectious events (as a proxy of potentially aggravating secondary 
infectious events) reported up to 90 days of follow-up are 50 (7.0%) pneumonia events in anakinra 
treated patients and 48 (17.7%) pneumonia events in the comparator group, 65 (9.1%) septic shock 
events in anakinra-treated patients, and 93 (34.3%) septic shock events in the comparator group. No 
information on neutropenia in anakinra-treated patients in the SAVE study is available from the 
sponsor.  
In the Sobi.IMMUNO-101study, serious TEAEs were reported in 1 patient (20.0%) in the anakinra 
group and 2 patients (40.0%) in the emapalumab group. No patients in the SoC group experienced a 
serious TEAE. None of the serious TEAEs was considered related to study drug. When classified by 
organ by organ system or syndrome the most common TEAE by organ system was respiratory, 
thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (anakinra: 1 patient [20.0%]; emapalumab: 2 patients [40.0%]). 
Laboratory findings 
Pivotal SAVE-MORE study 
Over-time, follow-up of laboratory values showed that there were no statistically significant differences 
between the anakinra+SoC and placebo+SoC arms at Day 1, Day 4, or Day 7 except for white blood 
cells (WBC) (median 6710 versus 7250 cells/mm3 at Day 4 and 7900 versus 8560 cells/mm3 at Day 7, 
respectively), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (median 5050 versus 5665 cells/mm3 at Day 4 and 
5785 versus 6620 cells/mm3 at Day 7, respectively), absolute lymphocyte count (median 1330 versus 
1200 cells/mm3 at Day 7, respectively), and s-sodium (mean 141.7 versus 140.1 mmol/L at Day 4, 
respectively). Since treatment was continued past 7 days, the interpretation of these laboratory results 
is limited. 
No data on vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety were available. 
Supportive studies: 
Data from the SAVE study was not made available. Thus, there was no data on vital signs, physical 
findings, and other observations related to safety. Those are expected to be submitted once available.  
In the Sobi.IMMUNO-101study no severe TEAEs or serious TEAEs related to laboratory parameters 
were reported. A non-serious TEAE of thrombocytopenia was reported for 1 patient in the anakinra 
group. The patient’s platelet count was within the normal reference ranges (150 to 450 × 109/L) on 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 86/133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Days 1 through 10. The patient’s platelet count was 94 × 109/L on Day 13 and 66 × 109/L on Day 15. 
The event was moderate and considered related to the study drug. The dose of study drug was not 
changed as a result of the event. At the time of reporting, the event was considered not recovered/not 
resolved. Of note, immune thrombocytopenic purpura can occur secondary to COVID-19. A non-serious 
event of hypertransaminasemia was reported for 1 patient in the SoC group. For this patient, ALT and 
AST levels were within the normal reference ranges on Day 1. From Days 4 through 10, the ALT and 
AST levels were above the normal range. On Day 15, AST had returned to the normal reference range, 
although ALT remained elevated. The event was moderate and considered related to the SoC. Action 
taken with the study drug was reported as not applicable. The event recovered/resolved after 22 days.  
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Mean values of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen 
saturation, and temperature were similar across the treatment groups at baseline.  
No relevant trends in vital signs over the course of the study were observed; however, the number of 
patients in each treatment group and overall was too small to allow for meaningful comparisons in vital 
signs between the treatment groups. 
Overall, the majority of patients had normal physical examination findings at baseline. 1 patient had an 
abnormal skin examination, and 1 patient had an abnormal abdominal examination that were 
considered clinically relevant. At baseline, clinically relevant abnormal examination of the thorax/lungs 
was reported in 7 patients (3 [60.0%] in the emapalumab group, 2 [40.0%] in the anakinra group, 
and 2 [33.3%] in the SoC group). All 16 patients had clinically relevant abnormal chest imaging 
findings. In the emapalumab group, ECG changes from screening were reported for 2 patients, no 
clinically significant abnormal ECGs or ECG changes from screening to Day 15 were reported for 
patients in the anakinra group.  
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
Intrinsic factors have not explicitly been studied for COVID-19. 
Studies in patients with hepatic and renal impairment have shown that anakinra is mainly excreted 
through the kidneys and that mean plasma clearance of anakinra after s.c. administration in patients 
with severe renal insufficiency and end stage renal disease (defined as creatinine clearance < 30 
mL/min, as estimated from serum creatinine levels) was reduced by 70% and 75%, respectively. 
Anakinra is not eliminated by dialysis, removal of anakinra via hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory 
peritoneal dialysis is minimal (<2.5% of total clearance). 
The approved anakinra product information recommends that physicians should consider 
administration of the prescribed dose of anakinra every other day for patients who have severe renal 
insufficiency or end stage renal disease. For patients with hepatic insufficiency, no dosage adjustment 
is warranted. It was confirmed that those dose adjustments also apply to patients with COVID-19.   
Extrinsic factors 
No extrinsic factors pertinent to individualizing therapy or patient management have been observed.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interactions between anakinra and other relevant medicinal products are described in the approved 
anakinra product information.  
Interactions between Kineret and other medicinal products have not been investigated in formal 
studies. In clinical trials, interactions between Kineret and other medicinal products (including 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products, glucocorticoids, and DMARDs) have not been 
observed. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Pivotal SAVE MORE study 
Overall, there were 5 patients who discontinued treatment due to an AE. The percentage of patients 
where the study drug was stopped due to leukopenia or due to increase of aminotransferase was low 
and comparable between the 2 groups of treatment (see table below) 2 patients from the placebo+SoC 
treatment group, one patient due to leukopenia and one patient due to derangement of liver function 
tests, were discontinued. 3 patients from the anakinra+SoC treatment group, one patient due to 
leukopenia and two patients due to derangement of liver function tests were discontinued. No 
leukopenia events were reported as serious. Three (3) (0.7%) Transaminases increased events were 
reported as serious in the anakinra group compared with 2 (1.1%) events assessed as serious in the 
placebo group. No increases in hepatic enzymes were associated with clinical consequences such as 
DILI or non-infectious hepatitis. The proposed treatment course of anakinra in COVID-19 is limited to 
10 days. 
Supportive studies 
No data are available for the SAVE study. In the Sobi-IMMUNO-101 study, 1 patient (20.0%) in the 
anakinra group and 2 patients (40.0%) in the emapalumab group experienced TEAEs leading to 
withdrawal of study drug (see table below).

Use in pregnancy and lactation 
 No reports of pregnancies in patients with COVID-19 were received by the MAH up to May 1, 2021.  
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, 
embryonic/fetal development, parturition or postnatal development. There are no adequate clinical 
study data from the use of anakinra in pregnant women since pregnant women were excluded from 
participation in anakinra clinical studies. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of anakinra during pregnancy and in 
woman of childbearing potential not using contraception. It is unknown whether anakinra/metabolites 
are excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with anakinra. 
Overdose, Drug abuse, Withdrawal and Rebound 
No dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical studies. In studies of sepsis, 1015 patients 
received anakinra at doses up to 2 mg/kg/hour i.v. (approximately 35 times the recommended dose in 
RA) over a 72-hour treatment period. The safety profile of anakinra in these studies showed no overall 
difference from that seen in the RA or other studies. 
Drug abuse 
Currently, no evidence exists for potential abuse of anakinra. No reports of abuse of anakinra have 
been received. 
Withdrawal and rebound 
There have been no clinical studies specifically designed to evaluate withdrawal and/or rebound. 
However, there are no indications of withdrawal or rebound effects in clinical studies, or from post-
marketing data, other than re-occurrence of the disease treated. 
Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental 
ability 
No studies on the effects of anakinra on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
There are no indications in clinical or preclinical data that anakinra would affect the ability to drive or 
operate machinery or impair mental ability.

Post marketing experience 
As of May 1, 2021, the cumulative post-marketing exposure across multiple indications is estimated to 
be 142, 955 patient-years. The patient exposure was estimated based on the amount of product 
distributed and includes all preparations (i.e., both the non-graduated and graduated syringes, which 
were first launched in the US in August 2013 and in the EU in April 2014).  
Review of MAH’s global safety database for anakinra use in SAVE-MORE 
study 
Serious AEs 
A total of 112 SAEs in 76 case reports for SAVE-MORE study were retrieved up to the DLP of June 8, 
2021, see table below. 
The review of 112 SAEs in 66 patients (76 case reports) revealed a mean of 64 years and a median of 
65 years (age band range: 30 to 89 years). The proportion of patients by age group was equal 
between adults and elderly patients (n=33 for each age group), of these 49 were male (74%) and 19 
female (29%) patients. 
The SAE outcomes were reported as favorable (recovered/ resolved/ recovering/ resolving) in 58 SAEs 
(52%); recovered/ resolved with sequelae in 3 SAEs (3%); not recovered/ not resolved in 3 SAEs 
(3%); and fatal in 27 SAEs (24%). The outcome of 21 SAEs (19%) were unknown. The reporter 
causality for the SAEs was reported as suspected in 12 SAEs (11%) and as not suspected in 100 SAEs 
(89%). The dose latency was reported in 99 SAEs with a mean of 13.5 days and median of 10 days 
(range: 1 day to 100 days). The distribution of the SAEs by SOC and PT from the case reports reported 
in the anakinra+SoC arm in SAVE-MORE study are shown in the below table.

study (safety database) 
Assessment report

Page 91/133 
 
 
 
 
Following the review of all 76 case reports, which were all SAEs, from the SAVE-MORE study as 
identified in the MAH’s global safety database, the outcome of the majority of the SAEs was favourable 
(52%). The AE outcome of 24% of AEs was reported as fatal and 42% as life threatening. Considering 
the inclusion criteria of the investigator-sponsored study included hospitalization for COVID-19 and the 
fact that a majority of patients (81.6%) were identified with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, this can be 
expected. The Investigator considered the majority of the reported AEs as not related (89%). 
The mean age of COVID-19 patients at anakinra initiation was 64 years and the median was 65 years, 
with an age distribution of 1:1 of adults to elderly. The mean age of patients experiencing fatal 
outcomes was 71.1 years and the median was 74 years, with an age distribution of 1:2.8 of adults to 
elderly. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people in their 50s are 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 92/133 
 
 
 
 
at higher risk for severe illness, than people in their 40s; meaning that a person with COVID-19 may 
require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die. 
Similarly, people in their 60s or 70s are, in general, at higher risk for severe illness than people in their 
50s; with the greatest risk for severe illness from COVID-19 being among those aged 85 years or 
older. Thus, no unexpected shift in age distribution was seen with the use of anakinra for treating 
COVID-19 and its complications. 
The most frequently reported AEs included pneumonia (16 AEs, 14.3% of all AEs); nosocomial 
infections (7 AEs, 6.3% of all AEs); pulmonary embolism (6 AEs, 5.4% of all AEs); bacteremia (5 AEs, 
4.5% of all AEs); and pneumomediastinum, hypernatremia, pyelonephritis acute, and septic shock 
(each with 4 AEs, 3.6% of all AEs). The clinical presentation of the most frequently reported AEs can 
be explained by the underlying COVID-19, nosocomial causes, and the use of corticosteroids (74% of 
case reports involved concomitant use of corticosteroids at baseline).  
The AE distribution for fatal and life-threatening AEs also followed a similar distribution with the events 
attributed to underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis and nosocomial factors.  
Overall, 52 out of 76 case reports had sufficient case details, such as medical history, concomitant 
medication, and dose latency, for a comprehensive causal assessment. The dose latency had a mean 
of 13.5 days and a median of 10 days. All 52 case reports had at least 2 non-COVID-19 pre-existing 
morbidities at study baseline affecting different organ systems with 2 case reports having more than 5 
organ systems affected, 12 case reports having more than 3 SOC affected, and 29 case reports having 
more than 3 organ systems affected. The most common non-COVID-19 medical histories reported 
were those affecting the cardiovascular system (e.g., hypertension, ischemic heart diseases, heart 
failure, arrhythmia, etc.), respiratory system (e.g., COPD, asthma), diabetes, infections, cancers, and 
obesity. As per the current understanding of COVID-19, adults with the conditions of cancer, chronic 
kidney disease, chronic lung diseases, dementia or other neurological conditions, diabetes mellitus, 
heart conditions (e.g., heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, or hypertension), 
overweight and obesity, smoking (current or former), stroke, or cerebrovascular disease can be more 
likely to get severely ill from COVID-19 resulting in hospitalisation, intensive care, ventilator support, 
and even death. 
Deaths 
Within the global safety database, a total of 15 patients (27 AEs) with a fatal outcome were received 
by DLP on June 8, 2021, with anakinra used in the SAVE-MORE study, as shown in the table below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 93/133 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 36: Distribution of fatal SAEs received in cases reporting the use of anakinra for treating COVID-
19 in the SAVE-MORE study 
The review of 27 AEs from the 15 patients revealed a mean of 71.1 years and a median of 74 years 
(age band range: 50 to 89 years). The patients’ age group ratio between adults and elderly was 1:2.8 
(4 adults, 11 elderly). Of the 15 patients, 11 were male (73 %) and 4 female (27 %) patients. The 
dose latency was reported in 27 fatal AEs with a mean of 15.6 days and a median of 10.5 days (range: 
1 to 100 days). 
On review of the fatal cases, the majority (73%) were elderly patients (mean age: 71.1 years and 
median age: 74 years), which is consistent with the age distribution of mortality cases seen worldwide. 
The most frequently reported fatal AE PTs were septic shock (4 AEs [11.6% of all fatal AEs]); multiple 
organ failure syndrome (MODS) (3 AEs [11.1% of all fatal AEs]); pneumonia (3 AEs [11.1% of all fatal 
AEs]); Acute kidney injury (AKI) (2 AEs [7.4% of all fatal AEs]); and nosocomial infection (2 AEs 
[7.4% of all fatal AEs]). The remaining AEs PTs were singularly reported. Of the 27 fatal AEs, the most 
reported AEs were infections and infestations (18 AEs [67% of all fatal AEs]), wherein the most 
common systems affected were the circulatory system (including cause of septic shock) followed by 
the respiratory system. The main causative organisms reported were Pneumococcus and Klebsiella, 
which are commonly known respiratory pathogens or bloodstream infections in underlying COVID-19, 
underlying pneumonia, or hospitalized cases. 
The clinical presentation of septic shock, MODS, pneumonia, AKI, nosocomial infection have been 
typically reported in critical COVID-19 and autopsies of COVID-19 mortality patients. Hence, the most 
frequently reported AEs identified as a clinical condition can be attributed to natural history and 
progression of the underlying COVID-19 or nosocomial causes.  
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 94/133 
 
 
 
 
Overall, all 15 case reports were confounded by COVID-19 progression, and/or medical history, and/or 
concomitant medication. The most common non-COVID-19 medical histories reported were those 
affecting the cardiovascular system identified in all 15 case reports with fatal AEs (such as 
hypertension, ischemic heart diseases, heart failure, arrhythmia, etc.), or diabetes or with 
comedication for diabetes (5 case reports [33%]), respiratory system in 4 case reports (27%) (e.g., 
COPD, asthma, etc.), extrapulmonary infections (2 case reports [13%]; septic shock, intraabdominal 
infection), and multiple co-morbidities (14 case reports [93%]). As per the current understanding of 
COVID-19, adults with the conditions of cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung diseases, 
dementia or other neurological conditions, diabetes mellitus, heart conditions (such as heart failure, 
coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, or hypertension), overweight and obesity, smoking 
(current or former), stroke, or cerebrovascular disease are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-
19 resulting in hospitalisation, intensive care, ventilator support, and even death. 
Serious infections 
Serious infections are considered important identified risks for anakinra. A total of 59 SAEs in 40 case 
reports of SOC infections and infestations were received up to the DLP on June 8, 2021, as shown in 
the table below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 95/133 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 37: Distribution of SAEs in SOC infections and infestations reported with anakinra arm in the 
SAVE-MORE study (safety database reports) 
On review of 59 AEs of infections, 18 (31%) were fatal. 41 % (n=24) of AE outcomes were reported as 
favourable (recovered/resolved/recovering/resolving) and 2% as non-recovered (n=1). The causality 
was reported as not suspected for the majority of AEs (88%, n=52) and suspected only in 7 AEs 
(12%). 
The most frequently reported AE PTs in the life-threatening cases was pneumonia (16 AEs [14.3% of 
all AEs]); nosocomial infection (7 AEs [6.3% of all AEs]); bacteremia (5 AEs [4.5% of all AEs]); septic 
shock and pyelonephritis acute (each with 4 AEs [3.6% of all AEs]); and Staphylococcal bacteremia, 
bacterial infection, sepsis, and Klebsiella bacteremia (each with 2 AEs [1.8% of all AEs]). The 
remaining AEs were singularly reported. The most frequently reported AEs suggested respiratory 
involvement or bloodstream infection with the most common sources being Staphylococcus and 
Klebsiella, which are common with underlying COVID-19, underlying pneumonia, or hospitalised cases. 
However, considering the SAVE-MORE inclusion criteria “Need for hospitalization for COVID-19”, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 96/133 
 
 
 
 
 
the fact that a majority of patients (81.6%) were identified with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, this can 
be expected.  
The dose latency was reported in 52 AEs with a mean of 18.3 days and a median of 10 days (range: 1 
day to 100 days). Reasonable case details for comprehensive causal assessment was available in 57 
out of 59 case reports, wherein confounders for predisposition to infections (in addition to pre-existing 
COVID-19 pneumonia) were identified such as the use of corticosteroids (29 case reports, 51%), 
diabetes (7 case reports, 3%), and serious cardiorespiratory comorbidity (100 % of case reports). 
About 51 % of patients were also on pre-existing higher antibiotics suggesting the possibility of a pre-
existing infection prior to starting anakinra. Serious infections are listed as common ADRs for anakinra 
as per current reference safety information. 
Life-threatening cases summary 
A total of 33 life-threatening case reports with 38 AEs in 26 patients, were received up to the DLP of 
June 8, 2021, as shown in the table below. These case reports were considered life-threatening but 
were not fatal. 
Table 38: Distribution of life-threatening SAEs reported with anakinra arm in the SAVE-MORE study 
(safety database reports) 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 97/133 
 
 
 
 
The patients’ age was reported in all cases with a mean of 62.3 years and a median of 61 years (age 
band range: 40 years to 89 years) that comprised 16 adults (62%) and 10 elderly (38%) patients.  
About 79% of the life-threatening AEs were reported in male patients. The dose latency identified in 
the 38 AEs had a mean of 13.8 days and a median of 10 days (range: 2 days to 67 days). 
The most frequently reported AE PTs in the life-threatening cases were pneumonia (6 AEs, 15.8% of all 
life-threatening AEs); pulmonary embolism (4 AEs, 10.5% of all life-threatening AEs); bacteraemia and 
lymphopenia (each with 3 AEs, 7.9% of all life-threatening AEs); and hyponatremia, hypoglycaemia, 
and nosocomial infection (each with 2 AEs, 5.3 % of all life-threatening AEs). The remaining AEs were 
singularly reported. 
Considering the clinical presentation of predominant severe respiratory involvement for the life-
threatening cases identified, the most frequently reported AEs can be better attributed to natural 
history and progression of COVID-19, nosocomial causes (such as HAP, ventilator associated 
infections), co-morbidities (such as diabetes), and concurrent use of anti-coagulants, diuretics (for 
electrolyte disturbances). This clinical presentation has been typically reported in critical COVID-19 and 
patients on concomitant use of higher antibiotics at baseline (covering broad spectrum and 
antibacterial resistance usually seen in a nosocomial setting suggesting pre-existing systemic 
infections). 
Overall, all the 33 life-threatening case reports (in 26 patients) were confounded by COVID-19 
progression and/or medical history and/or concomitant medication. The most common non-COVID-19 
medical histories reported were hypertension, ischemic heart diseases, heart failure, arrhythmia, 
diabetes, or concomitant diabetic medications. As per the current understanding of COVID-19, adults 
with the conditions of cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung diseases, dementia or other 
neurological conditions, diabetes mellitus, heart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery 
disease, cardiomyopathies, or hypertension), overweight and obesity, smoking (current or former), 
stroke or cerebrovascular disease are more likely to become severely ill from COVID-19 resulting in 
hospitalisation, intensive care, ventilator support and even death. 
Hepatic event case summary 
Hepatic disorders are considered important identified risks for anakinra. Overall, in the SAVE-MORE 
study, few patients (4 patients) experienced SAEs: transaminases increased, liver function test 
increased, hepatic enzyme increased, and gamma-glutamyl transferase increased. 
SAE of serum transaminases increased was reported in a 40-49-year-old patient who experienced an 
increase in transaminases (AST: 208 IU/L and ALT 447 IU/L) after 6 days of treatment with anakinra 
+SoC. This patient also received multiple medications (i.e., remdesivir and azithromycin) that were 
considered co-suspect concurrent medications. Following discontinuation of anakinra treatment, the 
patient’s liver enzymes started to recover, and the patient was discharged in 4 days when positive de-
challenge was noted. The event of serum transaminases increased was considered to be related to 
anakinra treatment, although the role of other concurrent treatments (i.e., remdesivir and 
azithromycin) cannot be ruled out. 
SAE of liver function test elevated was reported in a 30-39-year-old patient who had mild elevated 
liver function tests at baseline, due to antibiotics while treated for COVID-19. The patient subsequently 
started treatment with anakinra and remdesivir. After finishing the remdesivir treatment and 7-day 
treatment with anakinra, the patient experienced further elevation of liver function tests (AST: 195 
U/L, ALT: 321 U/L). Anakinra treatment was discontinued. The events resolved 4 days after 
discontinuation of anakinra treatment (i.e., positive de-challenge). The SAE of liver function test 
elevated was considered related to anakinra treatment, although confounding factors of remdesivir, 
Assessment report

previous antibiotics, and pre-existing baseline liver function test elevations can be additional 
contributory factors. 
SAE hepatic enzymes increased was reported in a 70-79-year-old patient who experienced the event 
after 5 days of anakinra treatment. Anakinra treatment was discontinued and the patient recovered 
completely in 5 days. The event was evaluated as related to study treatment with anakinra, although 
the role of concurrent antibiotics cannot be ruled out.  
A SAE of gamma-glutamyl transferase increased was reported in a patient after 10 days of anakinra 
treatment. No medical history or details of concurrent treatments were provided. The event was 
evaluated as related to anakinra; however, there was minimal information available to complete a 
medical/causality assessment. It was noted that the patient was asymptomatic and that the event 
duration was approximately 40 days, which also casts doubt on the contribution of anakinra 
considering its short half-life (6 to 7 hours). 
Overall, based on the review of the 4 case reports, there was no new safety signal reported for hepatic 
enzymes elevation. Hepatic enzymes elevation is a known complication of the antibiotic use, especially 
in infection. In addition, while patients are being treated in the hospital with other concurrent 
medications for COVID-19 (i.e., remdesivir), it is very difficult to differentiate which drug may have 
contributed to the hepatic events. All 4 patients remained asymptomatic and recovered completely 
after anakinra treatment discontinuation. The short duration (10 days) of anakinra treatment, along 
with the fact that the patients were treated concurrently with antibiotics and other COVID-19 
treatments that may also affect hepatic enzymes, confounds the cases and suggests an alternate 
etiology. 
Designated medical event (DME) case summary 
On the evaluation of the MAH’s database with SAVE-MORE case reports, 5 were identified as having 
events considered to be DMEs. These were events of anaphylactic shock (1 event), AKI (3 events), and 
pulmonary fibrosis (1 event). On further analysis of these patients, the anaphylactic shock was 
reported after completion of anakinra treatment in a patient who developed HAP while on ventilator 
support in the ICU. The event of anaphylactic shock was due to colistin treatment and was evaluated 
as unrelated to anakinra. The three AKI and pulmonary fibrosis events were evaluated as caused by 
the use of multiple antibiotics, as well as COVID-19-related complications. No new safety signal was 
identified on a review of the DME case reports.  
Review of the investigator-sponsored dataset 
A total of 171 case reports were received from 6 investigator-sponsored studies, of which 2 case 
reports were considered invalid. The breakdown of the 169 valid case reports by protocol number is 
provided in the table below. 
Assessment report

Table 39: Investigator-sponsored study cases by protocol number 
The most frequently reported SOCs (>30 events) were respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
(80 events); infections and infestations (76 events); blood and lymphatic system disorders (39 
events); vascular disorders (33 events); and general disorders and administration site conditions (32 
events). The most frequently reported PTs (≥10 events) were respiratory failure (27 events); shock 
and acute respiratory distress syndrome (23 events each); liver function test increased and anaemia 
(19 events each); electrolyte imbalance (18 events); AKI (15 events); leukopenia and septic shock (11 
events each); and MODS (10 events). 
Review of global safety database for anakinra use 
A search of the MAH Global Safety Database was conducted up to DLP of May 1, 2021, to retrieve all 
cases involving anakinra use and any indication PT coded within the COVID-19 standardized MedDRA 
queries (narrow; MedDRA version 24.0). 
Results 
A total of 613 case reports (valid case reports: 455; invalid case reports: 158) were received through 
the DLP on May 1, 2021. A review of the invalid case reports did not identify any new signals or safety 
concerns. 
The safety assessment for the COVID-19 indication was conducted on the 831 events in 455 valid case 
reports. The source of the 455 case reports is provided in the table below.

Table 40: Source of valid case reports 
The review of 831 AEs from the 455 case reports revealed the following information: 
- The off-label indication for anakinra for treatment of COVID-19, severe COVID-19 pneumonia or 
pneumopathy, or complications of COVID-19, such as severe COVID-19 with secondary 
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, cytokine storm syndrome due to COVID-19, ARDS, or paediatric 
multisystem inflammatory syndrome, are outside the product's marketing authorisation. Out of the 
455 case reports, 216 case reports involved off-label use with no AE. 
- The patients’ age was reported in 337 case reports with a mean of 55 years and a median of 61 
years (age band range: 0 to 99 years). 
- The patients' age groups were reported in 369 case reports and comprised 18% in paediatric age 
group (i.e., neonate [N=1]; infant [N=6]; child [N=42]; adolescent [N=16]), 45% (N=167) as adults, 
and 37% (N=137) as elderly. 
- The patients’ gender was reported in 419 case reports with 274 male (65%) and 145 female (35%) 
patients. 
- Out of 831 AEs, 476 AEs (57%) were serious and 355 AEs (43%) were non-serious. 
- Anakinra dosing ranged from 2 mg up to 600 mg. No meaningful information could be gathered from 
the dose ranges concerning the COVID-19 outcome. 
- The AE outcome was reported as favourable (either recovered, resolved, recovering, or resolving) in 
192 AEs (23 %), recovered or resolved with sequelae in 6 AEs (0.7%), not recovered or not resolved 
in 39 AEs (4.7%), and fatal in 121 AEs (15%). The AE outcome of 473 AEs (57 %) was reported as 
unknown. 
- About 90 % of the case reports were from studies and literature sources. 
- The AEs causality was reported as suspected in 55 AEs (6.6 %), not suspected (or no reasonable 
probability) in 317 AEs (38.1%), and not reported in 459 AEs (55.2%). 
- The dose latency was reported in 222 AEs with a mean of 9 days and a median of 7 days (range: 1 
day to 55 days). 
The SOC/PT distribution of the AE PTs (≥5 PTs) from valid case reports is shown in the table below.

Fatal cases reporting anakinra use for COVID-19 (off-label use) 
Within the global safety database, a total of 80 case reports (121 AEs) with a fatal outcome were 
received through DLP on May 1, 2021, associated with anakinra use for COVID-19 treatment (off-label 
use) as shown in the table below. 
Table 42: Distribution of fatal AEs received in cases reporting use of anakinra for treating COVID-19 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 103/133 
 
 
 
 
 
The review of 121 AEs from the 80 case reports revealed the following information: 
- The patient's age was reported in 73 case reports with a mean of 71 years and a median of 72 years 
(age band range: 0 years to 99 years). 
- The patients' age groups were reported in 74 case reports and comprised 1.4% of paediatric age 
group (child [1.4%, N=1]), 25.7 % (N=19) adults, and 73.0% (N=54) elderly. 
- The patient's gender was reported in 53 case reports with 37 male (70.0%) and 16 female (30.0%) 
patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 104/133 
 
 
 
 
- Anakinra dosing ranged from 100 mg up to 600 mg. No meaningful information can be gathered from 
dose ranges concerning the severity or the outcome. 
- Of the 80 patients with reported medical history or concomitant medications, 54 had at least 2 risk 
factors, 35 had at least 3 risk factors, and 27 had at least 4 risk factors, placing these patients in the 
higher risk category of getting severe COVID-19.  
- The dose latency was reported for 52 of the fatal AEs with a mean of 11.3 days and a median of 9 
days (range: 1 day to 55 days). 
The most frequently reported fatal AE PTs (>5) were death (cause unknown for 14 events [11.6% of 
all fatal AEs]); MODS (14 events [11.6% of all fatal AEs]); respiratory failure (11 events [9.1% of all 
fatal AEs]); ARDS (11 events [9.1% of all fatal AEs]); and septic shock (6 events [5.0% of all fatal 
AEs]). The clinical presentation of MODS, respiratory failure, ARDS, and septic shock have been 
typically reported in critical COVID-19 and autopsies of COVID-19 mortality patients. Hence the most 
frequently reported AEs, identified as a clinical condition, can be attributed to the natural history and 
progression of the underlying COVID-19 disease. 
A review of the case reports with fatal PTs occurring below ≤5 events and singular PTs at the MedDRA 
high-level term did not reveal any new safety trends.  
Non-fatal case summary 
A total of 33 life-threatening case reports (51 AEs) not reported with a fatal outcome were received 
through DLP of May 1, 2021, as shown in the table below. 
Table 43: Distribution of life-threatening AEs in non-fatal case reports reporting use of anakinra for 
treating COVID-19 
The  review  of  the  majority  of  life-threatening  AEs  for  non-fatal  case  reports  revealed  the  following 
information: 
- The patient’s age was reported in 30 case reports with a mean of 60 years and a median of 61 years 
(age band range: 20 years to 99 years). 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 105/133 
 
 
 
 
- The patients' age groups comprised 60% (N=18) adults and 40% (N=12) elderly. 
- About 77% of life-threatening AEs were reported in male patients. 
- Anakinra dosing ranged from 1 mg up to 400 mg. No meaningful information could be gathered from 
the dose ranges concerning severity or outcome. 
- The dose latency was reported for 46 AEs with a mean of 7 days and median of 6 days. 
The most frequently reported AE PTs (≥2 events) in the life-threatening case reports were ARDS 
(23.5%; 12 events), haemodynamic instability (7.8%; 4 events), septic shock (5.9%; 3 events), 
nosocomial infection (5.9%; 3 events), pneumonia bacterial (5.9%; 3 events), shock (3.9%; 2 
events), respiratory failure (3.9%; 2 events), dyspnoea (3.9%; 2 events), and pneumothorax (3.9%; 
2 events). 
The most frequently reported high-level group terms (≥3 events) were lower respiratory tract 
disorders (excluding obstruction and infection) (23.5 %; 12 events), bacterial infectious disorders 
(17.6 %; 9 events), infections - pathogen unspecified, and respiratory disorders NEC (11.8 %; 6 
events each), vascular disorders NEC (7.8 %; 4 events), and ancillary infectious topics (5.9 %; 3 
events). Most of the case reports were confounded by COVID-19 and/or medical history with the 
remaining cases having insufficient information to confirm a medical or causal association.  
Serious infection summary 
Serious infection is considered an important identified risk for anakinra. A search of the MAH Global 
Safety Database through May 1, 2021, for the COVID-19 off-label use cases, retrieved 61 case reports 
with 81 AEs. Events suggestive of COVID-19 or COVID-19 pneumonia were not included in the analysis 
of serious infection risk as they were considered as a disease under investigation. The table below 
shows the distribution of all SAE infection PTs (including events of COVID-19 and pneumonia) within 
the SOC of infections and infestations reported following the use of anakinra in COVID-19. This 
analysis is based on 54 case reports (73 AEs). 
Table 44: Distribution of SAEs within the infection SOC in cases reporting use of anakinra for treating 
COVID-19 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 106/133 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 15 of 54 case reports reported a fatal outcome, including 6 elderly patients. The patients 
developed AEs of septic shock (6 events; 6 patients), pneumonia bacterial (3 events; 3 patients), 
pneumonia (2 events; 2 patients), and sepsis (2 events; 2 patients); the remaining events occurred 
singularly. Furthermore, 2 adult patients died due to VAP developed while they were on ventilator 
respiratory support in the ICU and had various superimposed bacterial infections such as K. aerogenes, 
Pneumococcus and MSSA, and Enterobacter aerogenes. These 15 cases with fatal outcomes had 
complex medical histories, with several debilitating concurrent medical conditions and advanced 
COVID-19 disease. This resulted in superimposed bacterial and viral infections in the ICU/ventilator-
associated infections with fatal multiorgan failure. 1 patient died on Day 1, 1 patient died on Day 6, 
and 2 patients died on Day 9 of treatment with anakinra; the remaining 7 patients had a fatal outcome 
due to bacterial infections 15 to 41 days after the end of anakinra treatment. Advanced COVID-19 
disease with progressive respiratory deterioration in these patients resulted in the development of 
bacterial infections, although anakinra treatment’s role cannot be ruled out. 
In 23 of the remaining 39 non-fatal case reports of serious infections, the patients had recovered 
completely, recovered with sequelae, or were recovering. Most of the non-fatal case reports (21 case 
reports) involving serious infections were reported in elderly patients. Patients who experienced 
infections had multiple COVID-19 related risk factors, including concurrent clinical conditions making 
them susceptible to secondary bacterial infections, which included pulmonary conditions like asthma, 
COPD, and diabetes. The patients were treated with anakinra for COVID-19 for a short duration 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 107/133 
 
 
 
 
(mostly 10 days); thus, an increase in the secondary infections would be very unlikely. The infections 
experienced by patients were mostly due to ICU and ventilator-associated superimposed bacterial 
infections with advanced COVID-19; the incidence of such secondary infections is high in these clinical 
situations. Of note, 4 of the 39 non-fatal case reports involving serious infections were evaluated by 
treating physicians as related to anakinra treatment. 
In summary, serious and severe superimposed and secondary bacterial, fungal, and viral infections 
were reported in patients with COVID-19, especially for patients with associated COVID risk factors 
such as immunocompromised patients, elderly, patients with diabetes mellitus, asthma, and COPD, 
etc. In COVID-19 patients, anakinra is used for a shorter duration (e.g., up to 10 days of treatment). 
In other approved indications, the risk of serious infections is reported in the context of long-term use 
of anakinra. In most of the case reports, the infections were treated with antibacterial or antifungal 
treatments, and the majority of patients recovered completely. Although biological plausibility and the 
time to onset of serious infections suggest the possible role of anakinra to potentially contribute to the 
serious infections, the scientific literature and SAVE-MORE data suggest that these infections are 
reported at a higher incidence in COVID-19 patients, especially when patients need to be treated in the 
ICUs, with most of the infections reported as pulmonary infections. 
Hepatic event summary 
The hepatic disorder is considered an important identified risk for anakinra. The search of the MAH’s 
Global Safety Database up to May 1, 2021, for the COVID-19 off-label use case reports, retrieved 41 
valid case reports with 59 hepatic events. The following PTs were reported: alanine aminotransferase 
increased (5 events), aspartate aminotransferase increased (5 events), cholestasis (1 event), gamma-
glutamyl transferase increased (2 events), hepatic cytolysis (7 events), hepatomegaly (5 events), 
hepatitis (3 events), hepatic function abnormal (1 event), hypertransaminasemia (1 event), jaundice 
(1 event), liver function test increased (19 events), and transaminase increased (8 events). 
A total of 22 events were reported as serious; all were reported by physicians, pharmacists, or other 
healthcare professionals; none of these were fatal or life-threatening. A total of 29 events from 26 
case reports were from investigator-initiated studies, 24 events from 19 case reports were from 
literature, and 5 events from spontaneous case reports. 
Age band ranged from 20 to 89 years (1 case did not have information on the age of the patient); 11 
case reports with 14 events occurred in female patients. The outcome of the events was reported as 
not recovered/not resolved for 4 events in 3 patients; recovered/resolved for 7 events; recovering for 
9 events in 6 patients; unknown for 38 events. Dose latency ranged from 1 to 21 days when reported 
(18 events). A total of 9 events were considered as related by the reporter and 23 events were 
considered not related. The dose of anakinra was maintained for 2 events, discontinued for 7 events, 
temporarily withheld for 1 event, not applicable for 1 event, and not reported for 1 event. 
The results of liver function tests were evaluated in the case reports and showed normal range in 2 
patients, increased with mild to moderate intensity in 34 patients, and severe elevations in 3 patients; 
no results were mentioned in 10 patients. The review of 3 case reports with severe intensity revealed 
the presence of many confounding factors and other concomitant medications; the relationship of the 
increase in liver function tests with the drug cannot be established clearly, but the causality cannot be 
excluded. The data were also analysed with Hy’s law criteria.  
Although the available data were limited, still no new safety signal was detected. The in-depth review 
of details provided in the case narratives did not reveal any new safety issues. A clear relationship 
between the drug and the hepatic events could not be established. The major confounding factor was 
the underlying COVID-19 disease. Other confounding factors in addition to the concomitant 
medications could also have contributed to the onset or worsening of the hepatic events. Few cases 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 108/133 
 
 
 
had underlying HLH or secondary HLH based on the secondary HLH score criteria, which provided a 
strong alternate etiology. However, the relationship between the drug and hepatic events cannot be 
excluded. 
PRES case summary 
PRES (Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) is a potential complication of severe COVID-19. 
This is increasingly recognized in a number of case reports and case series. A recent paper by Llansó et 
al. 2020 implied the occurrence of PRES a few days after anti-IL (IL-6 or IL-1) treatments which raised 
the possibility that these immunomodulatory agents may also favour PRES. Therefore, in order to 
ensure a comprehensive review of the safety data, the MAH performed an additional search of the 
safety database to identify all cases of anakinra with an AE coded to the PT of posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome. The review of the MAH’s Global Safety database identified a total of 3 
reports with the off-label COVID-19, in patients aged 61 to 66 years. 
The search retrieved a total of 7 case reports of PRES (including the 3 COVID-19 case reports), of 
which the 3 case reports from the literature, 2 spontaneous, and 1 case each originated from a 
solicited patient support program and investigator-sponsored study, respectively. The case reports 
involved 3 males and 4 females; 3 were paediatric patients aged <10 years (1 with juvenile RA; and 2 
patients with a genetic inflammatory disorder with an overlap of Bechet’s and Crohn’s disease); 1 case 
involved a 30-39-year-old with familial Mediterranean fever.  
There was insufficient evidence to suggest a causal relationship to anakinra in the treatment of COVID-
19 at this point. 
The MAH later conducted a search of the MAH’s Global Safety database (data cut-off October 6, 2021) 
to identify all cases where Kineret was used in combination with an anti-IL-6 drug tocilizumab. A total 
of 176 cases were identified, of which 172 cases were considered valid. A review of the 4 invalid cases 
with no patient identifiers did not reveal any new signals of safety concerns. Of the 172 valid cases, 31 
cases were in an unknown indication. The majority of the remaining 141 cases (>80%) were in 
patients with autoimmune or autoinflammatory disease. A review of the 141 valid cases, involving co-
administration of Kineret and anti-IL-6, also did not reveal any new safety signals or safety concerns. 
An overview of the data from these 141 valid cases is provided below.  
In 141 valid cases, the most frequently occurring MedDRA HLT (≥15 PTs) are presented in the table 
below.

Table 45: The most frequently occurring HLT (≥15 PTs) 
A review of the events within the HLTs did not identify any new safety signals/concerns. The event PTs 
were in accordance either with the known safety profile of anakinra or with the background/concurrent 
clinical condition(s)/concomitant medication(s) of the patients in each case.

PRES is an acute neurotoxic syndrome that is characterized by a spectrum of neurological and 
radiological features from various risk factors. Of the 7 cases of PRES, 2 cases had no concomitant 
medications or medical history reported; or information surrounding the occurrence of PRES, to make 
a medical or causal assessment. Of the remaining 5 cases, 2 cases involved paediatric patients with a 
medical history of Behcet’s syndrome. In one case, which involved concomitant use of tocilizumab, the 
patient also had history of arterial hypertension and use of systemic corticosteroids, both of which, in 
addition to Behcet’s syndrome, are known triggers of PRES. Common factors known to trigger PRES 
include abrupt elevations of blood pressure, impaired renal function, preeclampsia/eclampsia, 
autoimmune diseases, infection, transplantation, and chemotherapeutic agents (Hinduja 2020).  
The remaining 3 cases involved use of Kineret in female patients over 60 years of age with severe 
COVID-19 infection. In one case, which involved concomitant use of tocilizumab, treatment with 
Kineret was temporarily interrupted in response to PRES, and then re-introduced at a lower unspecified 
dose with no re-occurrence of PRES; the patients concurrent condition confounds PRES. In the second 
COVID-19 case, the patient experienced PRES 3 days after a 7-day treatment course with Kineret was 
completed. Kineret has a half-life of 4 to 6 hours; therefore, the short half-life, in addition to the 
patient’s history of renal transplant and use of tacrolimus (both known triggers for PRES), makes the 
PRES unlikely to be due to Kineret. The remaining COVID-19 case had no medical history reported. 
The event of PRES occurred approximately 2 weeks after initiation of Kineret and action taken with 
Kineret in response to the event was not reported. However, the patient’s concurrent condition of 
septic shock (a known trigger for PRES), along with severe COVID-19 infection, confound the case.  
In patients with severe COVID-19, PRES can be triggered by uncontrolled hypertension, or occur 
independently in the setting of systemic illness and certain medications. COVID-19 infection has an 
impact on multiple SOCs. Several reports have described significant procoagulant events (Sakr et al 
2020), in addition to AKI (Nadim et al 2020) and gastrointestinal disturbances (Cha et al 2020; 
Trottein et al., 2020), both of which can lead to electrolyte disturbances (Pourfridoni et al 2021). 
Infection, renal disease, haematological disorders, and electrolyte disturbances are also all known 
triggers of PRES (Hinduja 2020). Current literature suggests that, like other infectious processes, 
critically ill patients with COVID-19 may be at greater risk of PRES because of impaired vasoreactivity 
(Lallana et al 2021). In summary, aside from the 2 cases of PRES with insufficient information, the 
remaining 5 cases were confounded by concurrent history/clinical condition/concomitant medication.  
A review of all cases involving co-administration of Kineret and anti-IL-6, in licensed and unlicensed 
indications, including in patients with autoimmune disease, did not raise any new safety concerns. The 
MAH has a robust signal management process in place and reviews data from all sources routinely. 
Kineret has been marketed for over 19 years and has an established and well-characterized safety

profile. To date, aside from the known safety profile and risks associated with Kineret, no new safety 
signals or safety concerns have been identified from licensed or off-label use indications. 
DME (Designated medical event) summary 
A search of the MAH’s Global Safety Database up to May 1, 2021, of the COVID-19 off-label use cases, 
retrieved 26 case reports with 27 events which included PTs on the EMA DME list of events. The DMEs 
included AKI (20 events), renal failure (5 events), pancytopenia (1 event), and pulmonary 
hypertension (1 event). A review of the 26 case reports, revealed the DMEs to be related to concurrent 
co-morbid clinical conditions along with COVID-19 related complications, and not related to anakinra 
treatment. The outcome was reported as recovered in 5 case reports.  
A fatal outcome was reported in a 70-79-year-old patient, who experienced renal failure along with 
respiratory failure. This patient had a complex medical history of coronary artery disease and 
hemorrhagic cystitis along with reproductive organs cancer. 
Literature search for off-label use of anakinra in COVID-19 
A review of all the COVID-19 literature (as part of routine literature surveillance) up to the DLP on May 
1, 2021, identified a total of 37 noteworthy articles (a mix of retrospective studies, case series, and 
reviews) reporting the positive benefits of anakinra in the COVID-19 indication. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Introduction 
The well-known safety profile of Kineret is based on the currently approved indications all with chronic 
long-term treatment. In COVID-19, Kineret treatment is limited to 10 days.  
Kineret has a complex safety profile that has been well established with 20 years of post-marketing 
experience in multiple indications, and with ADRs that are similar to clinical manifestations observed in 
severe COVID-19. Kineret has been associated with an increased incidence of serious infections in RA 
patients and in a small number of patients with asthma. Overall, the approved SmPC includes warnings 
regarding allergic reactions, hepatic events, serious infections, renal impairment, neutropenia, 
pulmonary events, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, immunosuppression, 
malignancies, vaccination, treatment in the elderly population ≥65 years of age, concurrent Kineret 
and TNF-α antagonist treatment and sodium content.  
Design and exposure 
The safety evaluation of anakinra for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia was primarily based on 
the safety data from the phase 3 SAVE-MORE study. In addition, supportive data were provided from 
the open-label phase 2 SAVE study and the company-sponsored Sobi.IMMUNO-101 study alongside 
supportive safety data from MAH’s Global Safety Database, including other MAH-supported 
investigator-sponsored studies, post-marketing off label use data from spontaneous reports and 
literature, and a literature search.  
The phase 2 SAVE study is still ongoing. The SAVE report covering Periods 1 and 2 was submitted by 
the MAH upon request from the CHMP. In addition, updated data on AEs were also provided.  
In the pivotal phase 3 SAVE-MORE study, the placebo+SoC treatment group had fewer patients 
(14.3% vs. 20.2%) with moderate pneumonia and more patients (85.7% vs.79.8%) with severe 
pneumonia compared to the anakinra+SoC treatment group. In the anakinra + SoC treatment group 
there were also a higher percentage of patients with co-morbidities (43.4% versus 38.6%) including 
more patients with e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus (16.3% versus 14.8%) and chronic renal disease 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 114/133 
 
 
 
(2.2% versus 0.5%). The identified differences in disease characteristics are not expected to have a 
significant impact on the overall conclusion on safety. 
No pooled safety data were provided due to a lack of standardization between the above-mentioned 
studies; thus, TEA frequencies could not be directly compared. MedDRA coded tables were not 
integrated in the safety summary but were provided during the procedure as requested by the CHMP. 
Overall, the mean ages in all the above studies above was 60 years, reflecting the age where the risk 
of a severe COVID-19 disease course is accentuated. For AEs, frequencies listed by organ system and 
syndrome where available, and were in alignment with the adverse event listings. The extent of the 
provided data from 1134 anakinra treated COVID19 patients is sufficient for the safety evaluation of 
this new indication.  
Adverse events (AEs) 
The most frequently reported AEs across groups in the SAVE-MORE study were hyperglycemia, 
increase of liver function tests, anaemia, and hypernatraemia. There were comparable proportion of 
patients experiencing at least one non-serious TEAE’s in the anakinra and placebo treatment groups, 
86.9% vs. 89.9% respectively. Most commonly reported non-serious TEAEs by SOC and PT occurring 
at numerical higher proportion in the anakinra+SoC arm compared to the placebo+SoC arm included 
the increase of liver aminotransferases (35.8% vs. 33.3%), hypoglycaemia (8.4% vs. 7.9%), 
electrolyte abnormalities (hypernatraemia (11.4% vs. 9.0%), hyperkalaemia (8.9% vs. 6.9%)), 
constipation (9.6% vs. 8.5%), nausea/vomiting (2.2% vs. 0.5%), anxiety (8.2% vs. 5.8%), rash 
(3.7% vs. 1.5%), neutropenia (3.0% vs. 0.5%), leukopenia (3.5% vs. 2.6%) and thrombocytopenia 
(2.2% vs. 2.1%). Of these, the increase of liver function tests (hepatic enzyme increased), rash at the 
injection site (injection site reaction), neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are listed ADRs in the 
anakinra PI; hypernatremia, constipation, hyperkalemia, and anxiety are not. None of the enrolled 
patients showed signs of bone marrow suppression (all three cell lines affected). It is acknowledged 
that there is only limited information on medical history, however a higher frequency of depression 
could indicate an existing imbalance in predisposition for mental disorders/vulnerability. Overall the 
safety profile is acceptable singling out hyperglycemia and elevated aminotransferase increase as the 
most frequent TEAs, with elevated aminotransferase at a higher frequency in the anakinra + SoC 
treatment group (35.8% vs. 33.3%). It is acknowledged that some of the numerical imbalances in the 
given TEASs can indeed reflect different manifestations of underlying disease. SmPC section 4.8 was 
updated to reflect that ‘in the clinical study in COVID-19, events of neutropenia were reported in 3.0% 
of Kineret-treated patients and 0.5% of patients receiving placebo. All adverse events of neutropenia 
were mild or moderate in severity.’ 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In the phase 3 SAVE-MORE study, the frequency of patients with at least 1 serious TEAE was lower in 
the anakinra-treated group (16.3 %, n=66) than in the placebo group (21.2 %, n=40) and likewise in 
supportive studies with lower frequencies in the anakinra-treated group than in the comparator group. 
In the SAVE-MORE study the most frequently reported serious TEAEs in both treatment groups were 
ventilator associated pneumonia, bloodstream infection, probable nosocomial infections, and 
pulmonary embolism. Infections and infestations were fewer in the anakinra treatment group (8.4% 
vs. 15.9%). Bacteraemias were evenly distributed 2.7% in both groups, but hospital acquired 
infections (2.5% vs. 3.7%) and ventilator associated pneumonias (2.2% vs. 7.9%) were fewer in the 
anakinra treatment group. Overall the safety data on serious adverse events are acceptable.  
In the pivotal phase 3 SAVE-MORE study the frequency of death was lower in the anakinra-treated 
group than the placebo group (3.2% vs. 6.9%) and was also lower in the anakinra-treated group than 
the comparator group in supportive studies: 4.6% vs. 12.3% in the SAVE study and 20.0% vs. 40% in 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 115/133 
 
 
 
the Sobi.IMMUNO-101 study. All deaths were considered to be due to COVID-19 progression and the 
patient’s concurrent medical conditions that were considered the risk factors for COVID-19 and may 
have contributed to fatal outcomes in these patients and considered to be not related to study drug. 
Overall, the safety data on deaths are acceptable. There were two more deaths (15 vs 13) within the 
global safety database. No reconciliation was performed as the 13 cases of deaths included in the 
primary endpoint and the 15 patients with STEAEs with fatal outcomes belong to partly different data 
subsets and cannot be directly compared. 
Serious infection as an Adverse Event of Special Interest 
In the PI currently approved for Kineret, it is stated in the SmPC section 4.4 that “Kineret has been 
associated with an increased incidence of serious infections (1.8%) vs. placebo (0.7%) in RA patients. 
For a small number of patients with asthma, the incidence of serious infection was higher in Kineret-
treated patients (4.5%) vs. placebo-treated patients (0%), these infections were mainly related to the 
respiratory tract” and “Kineret treatment should not be initiated in patients with active infections”.  
The CHMP agreed that the clinical presentation of the most frequently reported AEs can to some extent 
be explained by the underlying COVID-19, nosocomial causes, and the use of corticosteroids. The MAH 
provided data on the distribution of infections and infestations by SOC/PT in the SAVE-MORE study, 
raising no concerns of specific risk of infection in anakinra treated patients. The distribution of the 
majority of infections was in general lower in the anakinra group than in the placebo group apart from 
single cases of diverticulitis, hepatitis B, and skin infection (considered unrelated by the investigator) 
occurring at a slightly higher frequency. Also, there were higher frequencies of Staphylococcus 
hominis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Aspergillus flavus, Candida 
spp., and Hepatitis B virus, however numbers were low.  
In off-label use of Kineret in Covid-19, of the 112 SAE’s reported, 59 of them were infections and 
infestations, whereof pneumonia accounted for 16 of them. About 51 % of patients were on pre-
existing higher antibiotics and predisposing factors for infection including the use of corticosteroids (29 
case reports, 51%), diabetes (7 case reports, 3%), and serious cardiorespiratory comorbidity (100 % 
of case reports) were identified.  
Infections and infestations were fewer in the anakinra treatment group (8.4% vs. 15.9%). Bacteremias 
were evenly distributed 2.7% in both groups, but hospital acquired infections (2.5% vs. 3.7%) and 
ventilator associated pneumonias (2.2% vs. 7.9%) were fewer in the anakinra treatment group.  
In the SAVE-MORE study the incidence of infections aggravating the clinical course was lower in the 
anakinra group than in the placebo group and among the 12 cases of neutropenia in the anakinra 
group, no infectious SAEs were recorded. In the SAVE study, serious infectious events were registered 
as a proxy of potentially aggravating secondary infectious events with fewer cases with septic shock in 
the anakinra treated group (9.1% vs. 34.3%). In the Sobi-IMMUNO-101 study, there were no 
infections reported. No information on neutropenia in anakinra-treated patients in the SAVE or SOBI-
IMMONO-101 studies are available. Overall, the incidence of infections aggravating the clinical course 
was lower in the anakinra group than in the placebo group. No concerns are raised with regards to 
potential study drug induced secondary infections that may have aggravated the clinical course, 
including patients with neutropenia. The following information was added to SmPC section 4.4: 
‘Treatment with Kineret for COVID-19 can be continued despite (secondary) infections.’ The SmPC 
section 4.8 was also updated to reflect that ‘In the clinical study in COVID-19, secondary serious 
infections were common, however less frequently observed in patients treated with Kineret compared 
to placebo-treated patients.’ 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 116/133 
 
 
 
In line with the currently approved product information, Kineret treatment must not be initiated in 
patients with neutropenia (ANC<1.5 x 109/l). Further, the existing warning included into SmPC section 
4.4 is also applicable to patients with COVID-19.  
Discontinuations 
4 patients in the anakinra treatment group (n=3 in the SAVE-MORE and n=1 in Sobi-IMMUNO-101) 
studies discontinued, of these two were due to liver function test, one due to leukopenia and one due 
to respiratory failure. Data were not provided for the SAVE study. Overall the frequency of 
discontinuations in the anakinra treatment group were higher in the pivotal SAVE-MORE study 
compared to the placebo-group. It is unclear whether the impact on liver parameters and leukopenia 
was evaluated as related to the study product, however this cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, 
neutropenia and derangement of liver function tests are well-known adverse drug reactions to anakinra 
and are already described in the SmPC.  
The proposed treatment course of anakinra in COVID-19 is limited to 10 days and there were only a 
few discontinuations of study-drug due to leukopenia or due to increase of aminotransferase; and 
those were comparable between the 2 groups of treatment in the SAVE-MORE study with no clinical 
consequences of the aberrant lab values.   
Laboratory findings 
No clinical meaningful trends were observed among laboratory findings.  
Safety in special populations 
Aminotransferase increase was one of the most frequent TEA in the SAVE-MORE study with a higher 
frequency in the anakinra + SoC treatment group (35.8% vs. 33.3%). It is included in the SmPC that 
no dose adjustment is required for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). 
Kineret should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment. This is also applicable 
for the COVID-19 indication. 
The MAH has provided a list of Serious TEAEs and Non-Serious TEAEs in patients not receiving 
dexamethasone. The incidence of serious TEAEs through Day 90 were similar in anakinra and placebo 
groups (12.7% and 14.3%, respectively).  
No data are available on the effects of vaccination with other inactivated antigens, or COVID-19 
vaccines, in patients receiving Kineret. This has been adequately reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
A total of 173 COVID-19 patients ≥ 65 years of age were studied in clinical study. No overall 
differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. 
Because there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general, caution should be 
used in treating elderly patients. The SmPC section 4.4 has been updated accordingly.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The potential for DDIs with Kineret is limited.  
Pregnancy and lactation 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, 
embryonic/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. As pregnant women were 
excluded from participation in anakinra clinical studies, no adequate clinical study data from the use of 
anakinra are available in pregnant women. It is included in the SmPC that it is preferable to avoid the 
use of anakinra during pregnancy and in woman of childbearing potential not using contraception and 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 117/133 
 
 
 
 
that breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with anakinra. This is also considered 
appropriate for the COVID-19 indication. 
Overdose, Drug abuse, Withdrawal and Rebound 
No concerns are raised with regards to re-occurrence of COVID-19 as this has not been observed (up 
to Day 28 or in the follow-up period up to Day 90) in the SAVE-MORE study. 
Post marketing 
No new relevant safety concerns were found in the data presented from post marketing off label use in 
the COVID-19 indication and literature. 
Review of the investigator-sponsored dataset 
A review by the MAH of the investigator-sponsored dataset with 169 valid case reports (377 events 
(103 unique PTs)) was provided; and did not reveal any new safety observations or concerns.  
Off-label use 
Review of off-label use (safety assessment for the COVID-19 indication conducted on 831 events in 
455 valid case reports) showed that 57% of AEs reported were serious, but in 55% of cases the 
outcome was not reported. No apparent shift in age and gender distribution was seen on off-label use 
of anakinra for treating COVID-19, and it is acknowledged that the most frequently reported AEs 
(respiratory failure, shock, ARDS, AKI, anaemia, liver test derangements, electrolyte imbalance) 
identified could also be attributed to the course and progression of underlying COVID-19. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
The MAH identified 3 reports of PRES, a potential complication of severe COVID-19 in review of off-
label use of Kineret. A review of the 141 valid cases, involving co-administration of Kineret and anti-IL-
6 did not reveal any new safety signals or safety concerns, and no specific concerns are raised 
regarding the potential risk of PRES due to co-administration of anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6, including 
patients with autoimmune diseases.  
Overall, based on the data presented (including safety data provided from the SAVE-MORE study up to 
Day 90 upon request from the CHMP and presented below), the MAH considered that no new 
significant finding regarding safety was found.  
TEAEs occurring at a higher proportion on the anakinra+SoC group included:  
-  Leukopenia, neutropenia, injection site reaction, fall, rash, nausea, increase of transaminases, 
gamma-GT and alkaline phosphatase, blood pressure decreased, sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, 
anxiety, agitation, acute kidney injury, hyperglycaemia, hypernatremia, hyperkalaemia, 
hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, cystitis, acute epistaxis, chest pain and catheter bleeding. 
Neutropenia, rash, injection site reaction (ISR) and increased hepatic transaminases are already 
included in Kineret’s SmPC. Regarding ISR, for patients with COVID-19 that were treated with 
anakinra, ISR were reported with a frequency higher compared to the placebo treated patients. 
Nevertheless, the frequency of reported ISR in patient that received anakinra was still considered to be 
low by the MAH. Therefore, the addition of the following statement to SmPC section 4.8: ‘In patients 
with COVID-19 treated with Kineret, injection site reactions were reported with low frequency’ was 
agreed by the CHMP. According to the MAH, the TEAEs reported in the majority of patients were 
suggestive of advanced COVID-19 and its complications and/or worsening of patients’ concurrent 
clinical/background condition and concomitant medication; the same conclusion was made regarding 
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 118/133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
serious TEAEs. The CHMP agreed that the serious TEAEs reported can be related to the progression of 
COVID-19 infection. 
Overall, it is agreed that the data available up to Day 90 follow-up did not indicate any new safety 
signal identified with anakinra treatment in COVID-19. The data also supported that the safety profile 
is consistent with the other approved indications, taking the underlying disease, dose, and duration of 
anakinra treatment in the studies into account. The SmPC section 4.8 was updated to include D90 data 
on safety from the SAVE-MORE study. This is acceptable. Any new follow-up data should be submitted 
by the MAH i.e. as part of the final CSR of the SAVE-MORE study that will be submitted by end of 
December 2021 via a type II variation. In addition, the CHMP recommended the MAH to provide the 
final CSR of the phase 2 SAVE study, once available. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety evaluation of Kineret in COVID-19 pneumonia was mainly based on the pivotal phase 3 
SAVE-MORE study. In addition, supportive data were provided from the open-label phase 2 SAVE study 
and the company-sponsored Sobi.IMMUNO-101 study alongside supportive safety data from MAH’s 
Global Safety Database, including other MAH-supported investigator-sponsored studies, post-
marketing off label use data from spontaneous reports and literature, and a literature search. 
The overall occurrence of AEs, SAEs including infections discontinuations and deaths were lower in the 
patients treated with Kineret compared to the ones treated with placebo in the pivotal SAVE-MORE 
study.  
No new safety signals were identified in the treatment of hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 
pneumonia. Relevant adverse reactions observed in COVID-19 treatment were adequately reflected in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. The SmPC adequately reflects the safety profile of Kineret in this new 
indication. Overall, the safety profile is considered to be consistent with the known safety profile of 
Kineret in the other approved indications. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5.9 is acceptable.

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The package leaflet included in this submission is identical to the previously readability tested package 
leaflet for Kineret (indicated for RA and CAPS) with the only difference between the two leaflets being 
new indications (Still’s disease, FMF previously approved and the current variation for COVID-19).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic health emergency by the WHO on 11 March 2020 
and presents a global healthcare challenge. COVID-19 is associated with high morbidity and mortality. 
According to the WHO, as of 22 June 2021, there have been over 177 million confirmed cases of 
COVID-19, with approximately 3.9 million deaths reported to the WHO (WHO 2021a). As of 24 June 
2021, a total of 33.0 million cases have been reported in EU/EEA, with over 736,000 deaths (ECDC). 
The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to clinical 
conditions characterized by respiratory failure that necessitates mechanical ventilation and support in 
an ICU, to systemic manifestations of sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (Cascella et 
al. 2020). 
Most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, presenting with symptoms of 
an upper respiratory tract infection, including fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, 
muscle pain or malaise without evidence of viral pneumonia or hypoxia. Loss of taste (ageusia) and/or 
smell (anosmia) have also emerged as characteristic symptoms of COVID-19. Respiratory symptoms 
such as fever, cough, dyspnea and tachypnea without significant hypoxia are indicative of moderate 
pneumonia.  Long-term symptoms have been reported even in non-hospitalized patients who have had 
mild COVID-19. Approximately 15% of COVID-19 patients develop severe pneumonia characterized by 
the same clinical signs as moderate pneumonia with the addition of one of the following: respiratory 
rate (>30 breaths/minute); severe respiratory distress; or hypoxia requiring hospitalization and 
oxygen support (WHO 2020; Cascella et al. 2020). In approximately 5% of infected patients, the 
severe form of interstitial pneumonia with alveolar damage may rapidly progress to critical 
manifestations of the disease characterized by respiratory failure associated with ARDS that 
necessitates mechanical ventilation and support in an ICU, sepsis, septic shock, and/or multi organ 
failure including acute kidney and cardiac injury, and even death (WHO 2020). 
Mortality rate varies among regions and hospitals and with associated risk factors. In a cohort study of 
64,781 patients with COVID-19 treated in 592 US hospitals during April and May 2020, the in-hospital 
mortality rate was 20.3% (Rosenthal et al. 2020). In a multicenter cohort study that included 3924 
critically ill patients, 40.6% of patients not treated with TCZ within 2 days of ICU admission died 
(Gupta et al. 2021). Among patients admitted to ICU in a randomized platform trial (REMAP-CAP), the 
mortality in patients not receiving TCZ was 35.3% (REMAP-CAP Investigators et al 2021). 
The therapeutic indication initially claimed by the MAH for this extension of indication for Kineret was 
‘treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult patients with pneumonia requiring 
supplemental oxygen who are at risk of developing severe respiratory failure (see section 5.1)’. See 
below sections for the final restricted indication granted by the CHMP.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and clinical management of the disease are the 2 main 
strategies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Prevention with vaccines is expected to decrease the 
infection rate; however, emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants may constitute a threat, and the duration of 
Assessment report

Page 125/133 
 
 
 
protection following immunization is still unclear. Because of these uncertainties, an effective clinical 
management of the disease to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is of great importance. As of 
March 31, 2021, the antiviral remdesivir became available. For patients classified with severe disease, 
treatments include anticoagulation, oxygen supply, dexamethasone, and remdesivir. Since the 
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, immunomodulators were suggested as one of the main 
strategies to attenuate the exaggerated immune response of the host. Also, two monoclonal antibodies 
Ronapreve (casirivimab/imdevimab) and Regkirona (regdanvimab) have been authorised for treating 
COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms) earlier 
in the course of the disease (patients who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at 
increased risk of their disease becoming severe.) Besides these, two medicinal products are approved 
for the treatment of patients requiring oxygen supplementation, which is Veklury (remdesivir) and 
dexamethasone. Later phases of COVID-19 triggered by cytokine release syndromes are mainly 
treated with IL-6 inhibitors and dexamethasone. Recently, tocilizumab, targeting the IL-6 pathway was 
approved for treatment of adults with COVID-19 who are receiving systemic treatment with 
corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, while Kineret is considered 
approvable in the treatment of adults COVID-19 pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen (low- or 
high- flow oxygen) who are at risk of progression to SRF. Several other therapeutics are currently 
under evaluation in Europe. Despite ongoing advancements in the development of vaccines and 
treatments for COVID-19, significant unmet medical need remains especially in hospitalised patients 
with COVID-19 pneumonia who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure.   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The submission was mainly based on one pivotal phase 3 study, SAVE-MORE, which was an 
investigator sponsored study.  
SAVE-MORE was a double-blind, randomised pivotal phase 3 confirmatory study. In this study, a total 
of 1060 patients were screened from December 2020 through March 2021, and 606 patients were 
enrolled at 37 study sites (29 in Greece and 8 in Italy). Patients were eligible to the study if they had 
confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus, findings in chest X-ray or in chest computed tomography 
compatible with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), need for hospitalisation due to COVID-19 
defined by the attending physician and suPAR level ≥ 6 ng/ml. Patients were randomized 2:1 with 412 
patients were allocated to the anakinra+SoC arm and 194 patients were allocated to the placebo+SoC 
arm. The final intention-to-treat (ITT/FAS) analysis set consisted of 594 patients with 189 patients in 
the placebo+SoC arm and 405 patients in the anakinra+SoC arm.  
The primary objective of the SAVE-MORE study was to evaluate the efficacy of early start of anakinra 
guided by suPAR in patients with LRTI by SARS-CoV-2 in improving the clinical state of COVID-19 over 
28 days as measured by the ordinal scale of the 11-point WHO-CPS. 
Several secondary and exploratory efficacy and safety endpoints to support the primary endpoint were 
also included. In addition to the 11-point of WHO-CPS score, the SOFA (sequential organ failure 
assessment) score has also been evaluated. The SOFA score can be used to evaluate organ 
dysfunction in sepsis. Also, time to discharge, long-term safety by 60 and 90 days, changes in 
circulating biomarkers and viral load were evaluated. Mortality was not included as an endpoint, 
however, a supportive post-hoc survival analysis has been submitted by the MAH.  
Further supportive data were also provided from the ongoing, open-label phase 2 SAVE study.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The SAVE-MORE study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant and clinically 
relevant reduction in the WHO-CPS score at Day 28 in patients treated with anakinra+SoC as 
compared to patients receiving placebo+SoC (adjusted OR at Day 28 was 0.36 (95 % CI 0.26 to 0.50; 
P<0.001)). The effect was already present at Day 14 (adjusted OR 0.58 (95 % CI 0.42 to 0.79). 
More patients fully recovered by Day 28 in the anakinra arm in comparison to the placebo arm (50.5% 
vs 26.5 %, respectively). In a multivariate logistic regression model of the WHO-CPS of 0 or ≥1 
anakinra was protective (adjusted OR: 0.36; 95 % CI 0.25 to 0.53). The same results were seen when 
patients were divided into WHO-CPS ≥ 6 or ≤ 5 (adjusted OR: 0.46; 95 % CI 0.26 to 0.83), and the 
proportion of patients with severe outcome (WHO-CP score ≥ 6) was higher in the placebo arm than in 
the anakinra arm. 
Time to progression to serious respiratory failure (defined as PaO2/FiO2 <150, need for high flow 
oxygen, mechanical ventilation or death) also illustrated an effect of anakinra. Curves start to separate 
from approximately Day 3 and stay parallel from Day 8 and onwards (adjusted HR 0.66 (0.47-0.91), 
p=0.012).  
The 28-day mortality was lower among patients allocated to the anakinra+SoC treatment (6.9 % vs. 
3.2 %, respectively). Further, the univariate Cox regression analysis of time to death by Day 28 
showed that anakinra treatment reduced the mortality compared to placebo (HR: 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-
0.98). 
Treatment with anakinra, compared to placebo, had significant effect on the decrease of the WHO-CPS 
score from baseline by Day 28 and Day 14, and on the decrease of the SOFA score from baseline by 
Day 7. Anakinra treatment reduced time to hospital discharge. An increase in the number of patients 
fully recovered and reduction in the number of patients who progressed to SRF or death was also 
noticed. Anakinra treatment was associated with reduced mortality up to Day 28 compared to placebo.  
A subgroup analysis based on patients not receiving dexamethasone treatment during the study (11% 
in placebo arm, 15% in anakinra arm) showed efficacy of anakinra. In addition, efficacy was 
demonstrated in subgroup analyses based on age, suPAR and gender; thus, supporting similar efficacy 
of anakinra across subgroups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
This application was primarily based on interims results from a single pivotal phase 3 study (SAVE-
MORE). Furthermore, the evidence presented, particularly in the other RCTs conducted with anakinra 
in COVID-19, had contradictory results and did not provide robust support for this application. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP considered that the RCTs showing no effect included populations with 
substantial differences when compared with SAVE-MORE. Consequently, the CHMP considered that the 
statistically significant and clinically relevant efficacy demonstrated in SAVE-MORE provided sufficient 
support for an approval of Kineret in this new indication.  
Even though the study met most of the secondary endpoints, those were not controlled for multiplicity. 
Consequentially, the analyses of secondary endpoints can only be regarded as being supportive to the 
analysis of the primary endpoint. Even though, the clinical value of some of the secondary endpoints 
can be questioned e.g. the clinical value of a one-day shorter hospital stay and the median difference 
in CPS score of 1; they were considered to provide relevant information regarding the efficacy of 
anakinra in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen and at risk of 
progressing to SRF.  
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 127/133 
 
 
 
Slightly more patients in the placebo arm had severe pneumonia, required more high flow oxygen and 
their P/F ratio was a bit lower at inclusion (baseline) than in the anakinra group. Further, at baseline 
more patients in the placebo group received antibiotics, probably reflecting that more patients in the 
placebo arm had severe COVID pneumonia. This could reflect that the placebo arm is somewhat sicker, 
which may have affected the endpoints in favour of anakinra. However, as this was accounted for in 
the multivariate analysis of the primary endpoint, this issue was not further pursued by the CHMP. 
Since patients with suPAR level below 6 ng/ml were not included in the SAVE-MORE study, it is 
uncertain whether the treatment effect seen in patients with suPAR level above or equal to 6 ng/ml can 
be extrapolated to patients with suPAR level below 6 ng/ml. Therefore, the therapeutic indication was 
restricted to patients with suPAR ≥ 6 ng /ml only. This has been adequately reflected in SmPC section 
4.1 and a corresponding warning statement was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The clinical efficacy in patients critically ill (i.e. that have progressed to severe respiratory failure 
defined as i.e. in need of NIV, MV or ECMO) was not studied in the SAVE-MORE study. As such, it is 
uncertain whether an efficacy has been established in patients in need of NIV, MV or ECMO. While it 
could have been of interest to gain further insight on the efficacy of anakinra in patients that had 
progressed to SRF, this is not considered as an issue as the indication targeted an earlier stage of the 
disease i.e. patients that have not yet progressed to SRF. Nevertheless, a corresponding warning 
statement was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
A subgroup analysis based on supplemental oxygen at screening showed a statistically significant 
difference in the primary endpoint in favour of anakinra in both subgroups, however, the effect in the 
subgroup without need for supplemental oxygen was not considered clinically relevant, because none 
progressed to SRF. Therefore, the therapeutic indication was restricted to patients requiring 
supplemental oxygen (i.e. low- or high- flow oxygen). This has been adequately reflected in section 
4.1 of the SmPC.  
It is anticipated that only a few laboratories in EU are currently able to measure suPAR. In a post-hoc 
analysis, the MAH tried to identify other biomarkers associated with progression to SRF e.g. CRP, 
ferritin, IL-6 and D-dimer to define a score for progression. With this “SCOPE score”, a score was given 
to each four biomarkers according to a determined level. The MAH claimed that a SCOPE score >6 
could identify patients for treatment with anakinra in case suPAR would not be available. However, the 
score based on those biomarkers did not identify the same patients as suPAR ≥6 ng/ml did and 
therefore cannot replace suPAR in the selection of the patients at risk of SRF i.e. patients with suPAR ≥ 
6 ng/ml. Considering the decisive role of suPAR for the identification of patients that are suitable for 
treatment with anakinra in COVID-19, the MAH should ensure that an appropriate and validated test 
that reliably allows the distinction between patients with suPAR < 6 ng/ml and patients with suPAR ≥ 6 
ng/ml is available for all European patients. Such test should be adequately CE-marked as a 
companion diagnostic under the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation framework. 
The final CSR of the SAVE-MORE study will be submitted by the MAH by Q4 2021, as agreed by the 
CHMP. It is expected to provide further insight on efficacy based on the following exploratory 
outcomes: the 11-point WHO-CPS score by Day 60 and the 11-point WHO-CPS score by Day 90.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The well characterised safety profile of Kineret is based on the already approved indications, all with 
chronic long-term treatment. Kineret treatment for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia is limited to 
10 days. The safety evaluation was primarily based on the safety data from the SAVE-MORE study. No 
new safety signals were identified in the patients studied. The safety profile is overall consistent with 
the known safety profile of Kineret in the other approved indications, including infections.  
Assessment report  
EMA/772497/2021  
Page 128/133 
 
 
 
Slightly fewer patients in the anakinra treatment group experienced at least one non-serious TEAEs 
compared to the placebo in the SAVE-MORE study (86.9% vs. 89.9%, respectively). Most common 
non-serious TEAEs by SOC and PT occurring at numerical higher proportion in the anakinra+SoC arm 
compared to the placebo+SoC arm included the increase of liver aminotransferases (35.8% vs. 
33.3%), hypoglycaemia (8.4% vs. 7.9%), electrolyte abnormalities (hypernatraemia, 11.4% vs. 9.0%, 
hyperkaliaemia, 8.9% vs. 6.9%), constipation (9.6% vs. 8.5%), nausea/vomiting (2.2% vs. 0.5%), 
anxiety (8.2% vs. 5.8%), rash (3.7% vs. 1.5%), neutropenia (3.0% vs. 0.5%), leukopenia (3.5% vs. 
2.6%) and thrombocytopenia (2.2% vs. 2.1%). The increase of liver function tests (hepatic enzyme 
increased), neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are listed ADRs in the anakinra label.  
SAEs were lower in the anakinra-treated group (16.3 %,) than in the placebo group (21.2 %) in the 
SAVE-MORE study and in the supportive studies as well as lower frequencies in the anakinra-treated 
group were seen compared to the comparator group. In the SAVE-MORE study, the most frequently 
reported serious TEAEs in both treatment groups were ventilator associated pneumonia, bloodstream 
infection, probable nosocomial infections, and pulmonary embolism. Infections and infestations were 
lower in the anakinra treatment group (8.4% vs. 15.9%). Bacteraemia’s were evenly distributed 2.7% 
in both groups, but hospital acquired infections (2.5% vs. 3.7%) and ventilator associated pneumonias 
(2.2% vs. 7.9%) were lower in the anakinra treatment group. In off-label use of Kineret in COVID-19, 
of the 112 SAEs reported, 59 of them were infections and infestations.  
The occurrence of death was less frequent in the anakinra-treated group compared to the placebo 
group (3.2% vs. 6.9%) in the pivotal study and in supportive studies. All deaths were considered to be 
due to COVID-19 progression and the patient’s concurrent medical conditions. 
No clinical meaningful trends were observed regarding laboratory findings. 
Overall, relevant adverse reactions data in COVID-19 based on the SAVE-MORE study were reflected 
into SmPC section 4.8: Neutropenia, elevation of liver function test, rash and injection site reactions 
were reported more frequently in patients receiving Kineret compared with placebo.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There were no new or unknown unfavourable effects that could be discerned from the safety data 
submitted by the MAH to support this extension of indication in COVID-19.  
Three reports of Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), a potential complication of 
severe COVID-19, were identified following a review of off-label cases with Kineret. It is unclear 
whether to what extent co-administration of anti-IL-1 can induce safety event of PRES. However, the 
review of 141 valid cases involving co-administration of anakinra did not reveal any new safety signals 
or safety concerns.  
This application was initially based on interim CSR from the SAVE-MORE study. Further safety data 
were provided during the procedure upon request from the CHMP. However, the final CSR of the SAVE-
MORE study has not yet been submitted. Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH confirmed that the 
final CSR will be submitted as part of a type II variation by end of December 2021. Further long-term 
safety data are missing and are expected to be provided in the post-approval setting (e.g. as part of 
future PSURs).

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The SAVE-MORE study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant reduction in the 
WHO-CPS score in patients treated with anakinra+SoC as compared to patients receiving SoC at Day 
28. A robust and clinically relevant efficacy was therefore considered to be demonstrated with anakinra 
treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow 
oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure determined by plasma 
concentration of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) ≥ 6ng/ml. Further, an effect 
was already observed at Day 14, although the difference was not statistically significant. A favourable 
effect of anakinra was also demonstrated by the secondary endpoints, as more patients fully recovered 
by Day 28 in the anakinra arm in comparison to the placebo arm (50.5% vs 26.5 %, respectively) and 
the proportion of patients with severe outcome (WHO-CP score ≥ 6) was higher in the placebo arm 
than in the anakinra arm. Nevertheless, these results were not controlled for multiplicity and should 
thus be interpreted with caution. The absolute decrease of the WHO-CPS score from baseline to Days 
28 was significantly greater in the anakinra arm. Even though, the clinical relevance of an absolute 
decrease of 1 additional point (4 points with anakinra versus 3 points with placebo) can be debated the 
totality of the data are overall supporting a benefit of anakinra. Time to progression to serious 
respiratory failure until Day 28 also supported a benefit of anakinra. In addition, the lower 28-day 
mortality among patients allocated to the anakinra+SoC treatment in comparison to the placebo+SoC 
(6.9 % vs. 3.2 %, respectively) was considered clinically relevant. Time until hospital discharge was 1 
day shorter in the anakinra+SoC group than in the placebo+SoC group; although the relevance of a 1-
day shorter hospitalization is considered to be limited.  
Overall, based on the data submitted to support this application, the CHMP considered that a clinical 
efficacy was only demonstrated in the population studied in SAVE-MORE. As such, the therapeutic 
indication was restricted as follows: ‘treatment of adult COVID-19 patients with pneumonia requiring 
supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory 
failure determined by plasma concentration of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor 
(suPAR) ≥ 6 ng/ml’.  
The safety profile of Kineret is overall acceptable. No new or unknown unfavourable effects could be 
discerned from this COVID-19 pneumonia population who often had pre-existing co-morbidities. The 
risks thereof are adequately described in the SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the SAVE-MORE study, a statistically significant and clinically relevant efficacy has been 
demonstrated with anakinra in adult COVID-19 patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental

oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to SRF determined by suPAR ≥ 6 
ng/ml. In addition, anakinra also had a beneficial effect on time to progression to severe respiratory 
failure, on time until hospital discharge and on mortality.  
As no other biomarkers of inflammation could be reliably identified in recognising the same patients as 
suPAR ≥ 6 ng/ml did, the CHMP concluded that the data only supported the use of anakinra in patient 
with suPAR ≥ 6ng/ml.  
The safety profile of Kineret in the studied population is overall consistent with the know safety profile 
of Kineret in the other approved indications. No new safety signals arose from the data submitted. The 
long-term safety in this patient population will be closely monitored in the post-approval setting as 
part of the regular PSURs submission.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kineret in the ‘treatment of adult COVID-19 patients with pneumonia requiring 
supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory 
failure determined by plasma concentration of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor 
(suPAR) ≥ 6 ng/ml’ is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
C.I.6 - Extension of indication to include treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult 
patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of 
progressing to severe respiratory failure determined by plasma concentration of soluble urokinase 
plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) ≥ 6 ng/ml for Kineret; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 
4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP is 
updated to version 5.9. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Europe) Ltd. submitted on 3 March 2017 an extension of the marketing 
authorisation to add a new strength of film-coated tablets (100 mg Lumacaftor / 125 mg Ivacaftor) for 
paediatric use (6 to 11 years). The RMP (version 3.1) is updated accordingly. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008,  
(2) point  (c)  - Extensions of marketing authorisations 
Orkambi, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/14/1333 on 20 September 2010 in the 
following condition: treatment of cystic fibrosis. The MAH has withdrawn the Orphan Designation on 09-
10-2015 and therefore this product is no longer an orphan medicine. The new indication, which is the 
subject of this application, does not fall within any orphan designation.  
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0220/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0220/2016 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products. 
Additional Data exclusivity/Marketing protection 
The MAH requested consideration of one year marketing protection in regards of its application for a new 
indication in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004. 
Protocol Assistance 
The MAH received Protocol Assistance from the CHMP on 26 February 2015.  The Protocol Assistance 
pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulatory (CFTR) gene 
that result in absence or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is an 
epithelial chloride ion (CL-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, including lungs, pancreas, 
intestinal tract, liver, and vas deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water 
absorption and secretion. CFTR mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they 
disrupt CFTR function. Stop codon mutations (class I) result in a truncated nonfunctional CFTR, class II 
mutations consist of aberrantly folded CFTR protein that is degraded by the cell quality control system, 
while class III mutations lead to defective regulation of the CFTR protein and, consequently, the absence 
of CFTR function. These three classes usually lead to a classic CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency. 
CFTR mutations that lead to defective chloride conductance are grouped together in class IV. Class V 
mutations interfere with normal transcription, thereby reducing the amount of otherwise normal CFTR. 
These latter two classes are mostly associated with a milder expression of the disease. The most prevalent 
mutation is an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of phenylalanine at position 508 in 
the CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR) and it is a Class II mutation: it prevents most of the CFTR protein from 
reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no chloride transport. The decrease in the amount of 
F508del-CFTR at the cell surface is due to a defect in the processing and trafficking of the F508del-CFTR 
protein. The very small amount of F508del-CFTR protein that reaches the cell surface also has defective 
channel gating and a decreased stability at the cell surface. Patients who are homozygous with F508del-
CFTR defects have little or no CFTR protein at the cell surface and hence suffer from a severe form of CF 
disease. The failure of the mutated CFTR to function properly in the lungs result in a cycle of mucus 
plugging, infection, and inflammation that leads to irreversible structural changes in the lungs and 
eventually respiratory failure, the most common cause of death for patients with CF. Orkambi is indicated 
for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (class II).  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CF is a chronically debilitating, autosomal recessive disease associated with serious morbidity and a high 
rate of premature mortality and at present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately 70,000 individuals 
worldwide, including approximately 30,000 individuals in the United States (US), 32,000 individuals in the 
European Union (EU), 4,000 individuals in Canada, and 3,100 individuals in Australia. The incidence and 
prevalence of CF varies between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the Caucasian 
populations of North America and Europe than in Asian and African populations. The median predicted age 
of survival for patients with CF born in 2014 is 40.0 years of age. The predicted median age of survival of 
individuals born with CF today is approximately 40 years of age, while the median age at death is 
generally in the 20s. Although expected survival has doubled over the past 30 years due to advances in 
treatment, of those who died in 2014, the median age at death ranged from 27.0 to 32.4 years in the US, 
Canada, EU, and Australia.   
Assessment report  
EMA/781319/2017 
Page 7/74 
  
  
Orkambi is approved in the EU for the treatment of CF patients 12 years and older who are homozygous 
for the mutation F508del, the commonest disease-causing CFTR mutation. In the EU, approximately 80% 
of patients with CF have F508del on at least one allele and 40% are homozygous for F508del. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The biochemical defect of defective chloride channel function is present from birth, with the sequelae of 
lung, pancreatic and other organ involvement emerging progressively throughout childhood and into 
adulthood. 
The indication is restricted to the homozygous F508del-CFTR genotypic subpopulation of CF who have a 
severe form of the disease due to the very low level of chloride channel function. Even in this severely 
affected subgroup, however, lung injury proceeds at a slow rate and pulmonary function as measured by 
spirometry can be apparently normal in the 6 – 11 year old age group. Nonetheless, even with normal 
spirometry, patients can   have pulmonary structural aberrations on computed tomography (CT) scans. 
Consistent with this, impaired lung clearance index (LCI), which measures the degree of small airway 
disease by assessing ventilation inhomogeneity, can be demonstrated in paediatric patients with normal 
spirometry. Because the underlying molecular defect is the same in this age group and older patients, it 
was anticipated that LUM/IVA may be efficacious in this population to slow or pre-empt disease 
progression by correcting the biochemical defect in the chloride channel protein. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Lumacaftor is a CFTR corrector and IVA is a CFTR potentiator. LUM acts on CFTR to facilitate the cellular 
processing and trafficking of CFTR, allowing the protein to reach the cell surface, where it exhibits 
improved chloride channel function compared to uncorrected F508del-CFTR. The channel gating activity of 
F508del-CFTR that has been delivered to the cell surface by LUM can be potentiated by IVA to further 
enhance chloride transport. The combination of a CFTR corrector and potentiator is a novel approach to 
enhance the amount and function of the defective CFTR protein in patients with CF who have the F508del-
CFTR mutation. 
A modest restoration of chloride secretion through the action of the combination of LUM and IVA in vitro 
has been shown to improve fluid regulation and ciliary beat frequency in primary cultures of human 
bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells derived from donors with CF who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR 
mutation. In individuals with CF, this would be expected to improve the mucociliary clearance to alleviate 
the cycle of mucus plugging, infection, and inflammation that leads to irreversible structural changes in 
the lungs, and eventually respiratory failure for patients with CF. 
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor target the biochemical defect in the chloride channel protein whereas all other 
current treatments for CF alleviate the clinical manifestations of the disease but do not act on the 
underlying chloride channel defect. Current treatments include inhaled mucolytics, bronchodilators, 
antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, and pancreatic enzymes.

About the product 
Orkambi is a fixed drug combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor that combines corrector and potentiator 
action to provide a partial reversal of the biochemical defect in the chloride channel due to mutation in the 
CFTR gene.  
Orkambi is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The extended indication will be: Orkambi is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 
aged  6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).  
Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator through increased gating 
activity, resulting in increased chloride transport. F508del-CFTR is a Class II mutation leading to an 
aberrantly folded protein susceptible to defective intracellular processing and trafficking that prevents 
most of the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no chloride transport. The 
very small amount of F508del-CFTR protein that reaches the cell surface also has defective channel gating 
and decreased stability at the cell surface. Patients who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR have little or 
no CFTR protein at the cell surface and hence suffer from a severe form of CF disease. Lumacaftor is 
presumed to partially correct the folding defect in F508del-CFTR, facilitating its cellular processing and 
trafficking, allowing the protein to reach the cell surface. The channel gating activity of F508del-CFTR 
delivered to the cell surface by lumacaftor can be potentiated by ivacaftor to further enhance chloride 
transport. When added in vitro to F508del/F508del human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE), the magnitude 
of chloride transport observed with the combination of lumacaftor and either acute or chronic ivacaftor 
treatment was greater than that observed with lumacaftor alone. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The line extension application is for an extension of indication to children 6 years and older, from the 
currently approved target population 12 years and older. The same genotypic subpopulation of cystic 
fibrosis (homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene) is indicated. Orkambi is authorised in the 
EU as a single strength LUM 200-mg/IVA 125-mg FDC tablet for oral administration, given as 2 tablets 
(administered dose LUM 400 mg/IVA 250 mg) every 12 hours. The line extension proposes an additional 
lower strength FDC tablet, with a different ratio of LUM to IVA (LUM 100-mg/IVA 125-mg) from the 
existing strength (LUM 200-mg/IVA 125-mg) to be administered as 2 tablets every 12 hours in CF patients 
6 to 11 years of age with the F508del CF mutation. The total daily administered dose of LUM is therefore 
half (400 mg) that of the daily dose in children 12 years and older (800 mg) whereas the daily dose of IVA 
is the same (500 mg) in both age groups. 
This line extension is supported by a new combination of Orkambi with an altered ratio of LUM:IVA (50% 
reduction in LUM while maintaining the same quantity of IVA) intended for the  6 -11 years age group. The 
altered ratio was informed by PK modelling and supported by new PK data in the 6 -11 year old CF 
patients together with Population PK analysis comparing LUM and IVA exposures in 6-11 year olds 
compared with patients 12 years and older. The line extension dossier provides a single confirmatory 
efficacy and safety study of the age appropriate formulation at the proposed posology in the extended 
target population.

The product is available in blisters consisting of polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE)/ Polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) with a paper-backed aluminium foil lidding, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substances lumacaftor and ivacaftor have already been approved as active substances in 
Orkambi 200 mg/125 mg film-coated tablets of the same applicant. No new information on the active 
substances has been provided within this line extension application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The proposed new strength is also a fixed dose combination (FDC) presented as pink immediate-release 
film-coated tablets for oral administration containing 100 mg of lumacaftor and 125 mg of ivacaftor as 
active substances. The tablets are printed in black ink with “1V125” on one face. 
Similar to the existing strength, lumacaftor active substance is provided as a crystalline solid and ivacaftor 
active substance is provided as an amorphous spray dried dispersion (SDD) intermediate. The composition 
of this strength is very similar to the marketed 200 mg/125mg tablets in terms of the content %. he 
excipients used are qualitatively the same as those contained in the existing 200mg/125 mg FDC tablets. 
They are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC.

Product and manufacturing process development were conducted under a Quality by Design (QbD) 
paradigm. Much of the information presented for the registration of the 100mg/125 mg FDC tablets is 
common to the previously approved 200mg/125 mg FDC tablets. The components of the finished products, 
formulation development and manufacturing process development are identical for both strengths. 
The critical quality attributes (CQAs) and criticality thresholds of the 100mg/125 mg FDC tablets are the 
same as for the 200mg/125 mg FDC tablets. The proposed changes to the dossier relating to the 
100mg/125mg tablet have been provided. The main changes are with regards to the continuous 
manufacturing process development. In this regard, the desired manufacturing ranges (DMR) for the 
process parameters evaluated are also identical to those of the 200mg/125mg tablets with the exception 
of water added during twin-screw wet granulation (TSWG), intragranular (IG) blend fill level, and 
compression force, where some adjustments were made due to the changes in formulation. 
QbD experiments were executed across all steps in the manufacturing process to evaluate the impact of 
material attributes and process parameters on the drug product CQAs. The experimental designs of the IG 
blending and compression processes were equivalent to those of the 200/125 mg FDC tablet. A DOE for 
TSWG through milling and another DOE for compression were conducted, which led to the establishment 
of design spaces. No DOE was executed for the film-coating step, since the core tablet thickness of the 
100/125 mg FDC tablet is within the range previously studied during 200mg/125 mg and 200/83 mg FDC 
tablet development and therefore the criticalities and design space limits established for them are 
applicable to the 100mg/125 mg FDC. However, a single coating experiment at the wettest condition was 
conducted to confirm that there was no impact of coating parameters on physical form. Design spaces 
were established for IG blending, continuous manufacturing steps (granulation though compression) and 
film-coating.  
Finally, confirmatory runs were completed in order to validate predictive models for dissolution developed 
throughout previous QbD experiments in addition to verifying processability throughout the DMR at the 
planned commercial site. All dissolution values were within specification and acceptability with regard to 
magnitude/directionality of effect of the statistically significant process parameters and material attributes 
was confirmed. 
The primary packaging is a blister consisting of PCTFE (polychlorotrifluoroethylene)/PVC (polyvinyl 
chloride) with a paper-backed aluminium foil lidding. The material complies with the current European 
Guideline on Plastic Immediate Packaging Materials (CPMP/QWP/4359/03), the Directive 2002/72/EC and 
Regulation No 10/2011 and/or the relevant European Pharmacopoeia Monograph. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The commercial manufacturing process for the 100mg/125 mg lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablet is very 
similar to the existing 200mg/125mg tablets, with some adjustments on some operating ranges as 
described under the manufacturing process development section above.  
Briefly, the manufacture of Orkambi FDC tablets is a two-stage process. 
In the first stage (figure 1), crystalline ivacaftor active substance is dissolved with a polymer and a 
surfactant in the process solvents, then spray dried to form a powder, which undergoes secondary drying 
Assessment report  
EMA/781319/2017 
Page 11/74 
  
  
to further remove process solvents to acceptable limits.  This results in an amorphous spray-dried 
dispersion drug product intermediate (SDD) which is a free flowing, compressible powder.  
The second stage, which involves the manufacture of the FDC tablets, consists of seven steps: intra-
granular blending of ivacaftor SDD and lumacaftor, twin screw wet granulation, fluid bed drying and 
milling, extra-granular blending, compression, film coating, and printing. 
The process flow diagram for the second stage is shown in figure 2, with the blue box denoting the portion 
of the manufacturing process that is operated on a continuous mode (all steps granulation to 
compression). Intragranular blending and film coating are performed in batch mode.

indicate the boundaries of the continuous process equipment used at the proposed manufacturing site. 
As indicated above, design spaces have been defined for IG blending, continuous manufacturing steps 
(granulation though compression) and film-coating. Adequate in-process controls have been defined.  
Design spaces have been established for the several steps of the manufacturing process of the SDD (spray 
drying) and the FDC tablets: intra-granular blending, twin screw wet granulation, fluid bed drying and 
milling, extra-granular blending, compression and film coating. The desired manufacturing ranges (DMR) 
for the process parameters evaluated are also identical to those of the 200mg/125mg tablets with the 
exception of water added during TSWG, IG blend fill level, and compression force. There are a number of 
process parameters that have differing design space limits (DSL) and normal operating range (NOR) set 
points when compared to the approved 200mg/125mg tablets. Satisfactory justification for those changes 
was provided during the evaluation and it was concluded that the proposed DSL ranges for the 100 
mg/125mg tablets are acceptable. As for the 200mg/125mg tablets, design spaces have been developed 
at the commercial scale manufacturing equipment.  
Process validation of the ivacaftor SDD intermediate manufacturing process was performed for the 
registration of the 200mg/125mg tablets on three commercial scale batches. For the manufacture of the 
FDC tablets, traditional process validation, in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on process validation for

finished products (EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1), was conducted on three consecutive 
commercial scale batches at the proposed manufacturing site (in line with the submitted process validation 
scheme. It has been demonstrated that the process is capable of reproducible commercial manufacture. 
Product specification 
The product release specification is based on the 200mg/125mg tablet with the proportional reduction in 
strength. The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance  (visual),  identification  (IR),  assay  (HPLC),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.),  water  content  (KF), 
uniformity of dosage units (HPLC) and physical form of lumacaftor and ivacaftor (XRPD).  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing, 
The description and appearance of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablet, 100mg/125 mg as pink film-coated 
tablet, printed in black ink with “1V125” on one face is similar to the 200mg/125 mg tablet. During the 
evaluation there were concerns that the different strengths would not be sufficiently distinguishable. The 
applicant stated in his response, that the 100/125mg tablet and the 200mg/125mg tablet can be 
distinguished by three factors: print, shape and size/thickness. In addition, the commercial packaging of 
the two FDCs are clearly labelled and can be easily distinguished. Although there is a potential for 
confusion with regards to the print on the tablets (where only 1 figure is different out of 5 figures), it was 
concluded that there are sufficient distinguishing factors such as size/thickness and colour in the outer 
packaging is clearly distinguishable and the applicant’s proposal was considered acceptable. 
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are both stable molecules. No degradation products were observed at or above 
the reporting threshold (0.10% w/w) in representative lots of lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets at release 
or on stability.  In addition, no degradation products were seen during development or during QbD studies. 
Therefore degradation products are not included in the release specification and are tested on stability 
only. 
The analytical methods used are identical to those already approved for the 200mg/125mg tablets. They 
have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The 
information regarding the reference standards used for assay is the same as that presented for the 
approved 200mg/100mg tablets. 
Batch analysis results are provided for four batches used in clinical studies and formal stability studies 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  three  formal  stability  batches  of  finished  product  stored  under  long  term  (25  ºC  /  60% 
RH) or intermediate (30 °C ± 2 °C/65% RH ± 5% RH) conditions for 24 months and for up to 6 months 
under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The 
batches of Orkambi 100mg/125mg tablets are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed 
in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

EMA/781319/2017

Samples  stored  at  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation 
products  (validated  HPLC),  dissolution,  ivacaftor  and  lumacaftor  physical  form.  Samples  stored  at 
intermediate  conditions  were  tested  for  microbial  count  (TAMC,  TYMC)  and  specified  microorganisms:  E. 
coli. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
All results met the acceptance criteria for the attributes evaluated and no trends were observed for assay 
or  degradation  products.  Although  a  slight  downward  trend  was  observed  in  ivacaftor  dissolution  at 
25°C/60%  RH  and  lumacaftor  dissolution  at  40°C/75%  RH,  all  results  remained  within  the  acceptance 
limits and are expected to remain within those limits through the proposed shelf-life period.  
Although  water  content  is  not  a  formal  stability  test,  it  was  monitored  throughout  stability.  Although  a 
small increase  in  water  content  was  observed  under  the  long-term  and  accelerated  storage  conditions,  it 
has no impact on the tablet physical and chemical properties.  
In  addition,  photostability  per  ICH  Q1B,  Option  2,  was  evaluated  on  one  batch  of  lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
200mg/125mg tablets. Samples were tested for appearance, assay and degradation products. 
The  data  showed  no  changes  in  the  fully  exposed  test  samples  and  the  covered  controls,  demonstrating 
that the lumacaftor/ivacaftor tablets do not require light protective packaging. 
Overall,  the  stability  data  presented  is  in  line  with  the  results  observed  on  the  approved  200mg/125 mg 
tablets.  They  showed  that  the  finished  product  is  chemically  and  physically  stable  when  packaged  in  the 
configuration proposed for commercial distribution under all storage conditions.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months with the storage recommendation to 
store below 30°C as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the 100mg/125mg FDC tablets has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The applicant has applied the same QbD principles used for the existing 200 mg/125 mg FDC tablets for 
the development of this new strength. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the 
manufacture of the finished product. The design spaces have been adequately verified. 
The manufacture of the FDC tablets uses a continuous wet granulation process. Drying, milling, 
extragranular blending and compression are also performed in a continuous mode.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
For the current extension of indication to children 6-11 years old, no nonclinical data on pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology were provided, apart from lumacaftor juvenile toxicity study conclusions 
(see section 2.3.4). 
Previous reproductive, developmental and embryo-foetal development toxicity studies conducted with 
lumacaftor in rats and rabbits indicated that it is not a reproductive and/or developmental toxicant and not 
teratogenic or a developmental toxicant in rats and rabbits. When co-administered to rats, lumacaftor and 
its metabolite M28-lumacaftor, did not result in toxicity to male or female reproductive systems and did 
not produce any adverse effects on maternal and/or F1-generation prenatal/postnatal development. M28-
lumacaftor produced developmental toxicities (foetal malformations) only at high doses which resulted in 
significant maternal toxicity in rats. 
The reproductive and developmental toxicity profile of ivacaftor, together with the assessment of juvenile 
toxicity has previously established in rats and rabbits in support of the registration of KalydecoTM.  
Ivacaftor had minimal effects on female reproduction and foetal development in rats, which were 
attributed to significant maternal toxicity, and it was associated with ocular toxicities in juvenile animals. 
Ivacaftor was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits and had no effects on the male rat reproductive system, 
but had effects on female rat reproduction (54% reduction in fertility index and number of 
pregnancies/cohabiting female) and on early embryonic development (increases in pre- and post-
implantation loss and litters consisting of all nonviable embryos and changes in estrous cycling) at 
maternally toxic doses. There were no adverse effects on learning and memory or on reproductive capacity 
in offspring (F1 generation rats). Juvenile toxicity studies identified the eye (lens opacities/cataracts) as a 
target organ of toxicity, which were not detected in repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in older mice, 
rats, or dogs. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No nonclinical studies were conducted as the pharmacology of ivacaftor and lunacaftor is well known. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No nonclinical studies were conducted as the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor and lunacaftor is well known.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
In the juvenile rat study, lumacaftor at 500 mg/kg/day was associated with mortality in one male animal 
on PND 10.  Macroscopic and microscopic were suggestive of postnatal hypoglycaemia which may have 
been associated with a failure of suckling. No other target organ toxicity was observed at 125 and 250 
mg/kg/day and therefore the dose of 250 mg/kg/day is deemed to be the NOAEL.  The exposure to 
lumacaftor observed at this dose represents an approximate 5-fold safety factor to that seen in subjects 
aged 6 to 11 years in clinical study 011.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A definitive assessment on the potential risk of ivacaftor and lumacaftor to the environment is not being 
made at this time but will be conducted once data from ongoing studies are submitted. The MAH has made 
a commitment to perform the required studies and update the ERA. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The results of the juvenile toxicity study do not affect the overall conclusions on the potential toxicity of 
lumacaftor and therefore no amendments to the SmPC are required and none have been made.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No issues have been identified from a nonclinical perspective and the lumacaftor juvenile data suitably 
supports this application for extension of Orkambi’s use to children 6-11 years old. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

Study 109  
The pharmacokinetics data to support the dose selection for the pivotal efficacy and safety study 109 in 
the 6 – 11 years age group were derived principally from study 011, Parts A and B (Part A being a Phase I 
study that evaluated PK, safety and tolerability as a PK lead-in to Study 011B, a Phase III study that 
evaluated PK, PD, safety and tolerability). Study 109 was a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LUM/IVA for 24 weeks in subjects 6 through 11 
years of age with CF, homozygous for F508del. Approximately 200 subjects were planned to be 
randomized (1:1) to LUM/IVA or placebo. Evaluation of PK was included as a secondary objective. 
Population PK models for LUM and IVA were utilized for evaluation of PK results obtained in Study 109. 
The objective of the population PK analysis was to characterize LUM and IVA exposures in subjects 6 
through 11 years of age for comparison with exposures from subjects 12 years and older.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Orkambi is already authorised in the EU as a single strength LUM 200-mg/IVA 125-mg tablet for oral 
administration, given as 2 tablets (administered dose LUM 400 mg/IVA 250 mg) every 12 hours. This line 
extension includes an additional lower strength fixed dose combination tablet, with a different ratio of LUM 
to IVA (LUM 100-mg/IVA 125-mg) from the existing strength (LUM 200-mg/IVA 125-mg) to be 
administered as 2 tablets every 12 hours in CF patients 6 to 11 years of age with the F508del CF mutation. 
The total daily administered dose of LUM is therefore half (400 mg) that of the daily dose in children 12 
years and older (800 mg) whereas the daily dose of IVA is the same (500 mg) in both age groups.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) modelling conformed the altered ratio of LUM:IVA in the new strength tablet (50% 
reduction in LUM while maintaining the same quantity of IVA) intended for the younger age group.  
Although decreased IVA clearance would be anticipated with decreasing body weight, this is offset by an 
increase in IVA clearance due to increased CYP3A4 induction from increased LUM exposure with decreasing 
body weight. Given that IVA is a CYP3A4 substrate, this will tend to reduce IVA exposure in patients with 
lower body weight. This is the essential basis for maintaining the IVA dose at the same level in the two 
tablet strengths.  
Pharmacokinetic data to support the line extension are mainly derived from two Phase III studies (study 
011 B, an open label uncontrolled 24 week study; and study 109, a placebo controlled 24 week pivotal 
efficacy and safety study) together with a population PK analysis the objective of which was to compare 
observed, and predict population, data for LUM and IVA exposures in 6 to 11 year old patients compared 
with patients 12 years and older. In both  011B and 109, LUM/IVA were conducted in 6 – 11 year old CF 
patients homozygous for F508del-CFTR, the genotypic subgroup for which Orkambi is currently authorised, 
administered with the LUM/IVA FDC at the proposed posology for this age group. Both PK studies were 
conducted in the fed state, due to the increase in bioavailability of Orkambi with food, as recommended in 
the SmPC. Study 011B demonstrated that mean IVA and LUM concentrations in subjects 6 through 11 
years of age were similar to those of subjects 12 years and older, administered with the respective age 
appropriate formulations. Population PK analysis (report Pop PK M406) was conducted on data from 
studies 109 and 011B (6 – 11 years age group) and compared to data from Studies 103 and 104 (age 12 
years and above). All subjects were homozygous for F508del-CFTR and were administered with the 
respective formulations intended for their age group. The PK data set consisted of 918 lumacaftor and 907 
ivacaftor plasma concentration measurements from 165 subjects over a 24-week period. There were 
slightly more female than male subjects. The age distribution was skewed towards older subjects. Weight 
ranged from 18 to 57 kg, with a median of 30 kg, see figure below.

Population PK analysis showed that plasma concentrations of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in 165 CF subjects 6 
to 11 years of age, who were treated twice daily for 24 weeks with lumacaftor in combination with 
ivacaftor, were well described by standard two-compartment PK models. The ivacaftor model was coupled 
to the lumacaftor model by a term that captures the induction of CYP3A by lumacaftor. This exposure-
dependent induction of CYP3A increases ivacaftor’s clearance. Model parameter estimates were similar to 
estimates that had been obtained previously for CF subjects 12 years and older. 
The Pop PK data confirm the importance of body weight to lumacaftor and ivacaftor exposure and support 
the reduction in lumacaftor dose, while maintaining the same ivacaftor dose, in the younger age group.  
The majority of patients in the 6-11 years age group had LUM and IVA exposure levels that were within 
the 5th and 95th percentiles for LUM and IVA exposure in the older age group (12 years and above) 
administered with twice the dose of lumacaftor but the same dose of ivacaftor as in children 6 – 11 years.  
There was, as expected, a downwards trend to lower LUM exposure with increasing body weight in the 6 – 
11 years age group. However, there was no clear relationship to body weight in the 6 – 11 years age 
group in those below the 5th percentile of LUM exposure.  As for LUM exposure, the majority of IVA 
exposure in the 6 – 11 years age group is between the 5th and 95th percentiles for IVA exposure in the 12 
years and above age group administered the age-appropriate formulation. In this case however, all the 
outliers in the 6 – 11 years age group were  above the 95th percentile, some substantively so, suggesting 
that in some children, the higher ratio of IVA/LUM has over-compensated for the anticipated increase in 
CYP3A4 induction due to higher LUM exposure with decreasing body weight.  As for the LUM outliers there 
was no clear relationship with body weight. Furthermore, all but 2 of the outliers were within the range for 
mean IVA AUC when given as monotherapy in this age range (10.8 to 15.3 hr.µg/mL). Median LUM AUC in 
the 6 – 11 years age group was of the order of 10% lower than in the older age groups. Median IVA AUC 
was of the order of 30% higher in the 6 – 11 years age group compared with the older age groups.   
Although there are moderate differences in the IVA AUC0-12h, the observed trough concentrations for 
subjects 6 through 11 years of age are similar of those of older subjects, particularly for Study 109. To 
maintain trough concentrations that are comparable to the older population, the AUC0-12h needs to be 
higher for subjects 6 through 11 years of age. This is due to the differences in allometric scaling (i.e. 
different exponents) for clearance and volume of distribution with weight. For a similar range of C trough 
values in the older population, the peak concentration and the corresponding AUC will be higher in 
subjects 6 through 11 years of age. The principle that higher IVA exposure is needed to maintain trough 
IVA concentrations comparable to those in the older age group is accepted. Nonetheless, the acceptability 
of the AUC outliers is in part derived from comparison with the mean IVA AUC when given as monotherapy 
at a dose of 150 mg twice daily. Since the initial approval of IVA as monotherapy, model-based 
simulations have resulted in a downwards revision of dose in children weighing less than 25 kg to 75 mg 
twice daily. In the responses to the CHMP’s request it was confirmed that even at the revised dose of 
Kalydeco of 75 mg q12h in 6 – 11 year olds weighing 14–25 kg, mean IVA AUC is still substantively higher  
than with Orkambi in the age appropriate formulation administered to the 6-11 year old, 14–25 kg group .

Comparisons of IVA exposure between Orkambi and Kalydeco in the 6-11 year old age group are therefore 
valid for the revised lower dose of Kalydeco in children weighing less than 25 kg.   
The use of an age cut-off of 11 years, beyond which the higher strength formulation should be used, 
without dose adjustment for body weight, is supported by the Pop PK analysis. The MAH’s conclusions 
from the PopPK analysis are therefore overall endorsed by the CHMP.   
There is minimal renal excretion of parent LUM/IVA drug and metabolites. The Pop PK analysis supplied 
with the original dossier indicated no effect of mild or moderate renal impairment on PK. Therefore no 
dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. However, given that 
uraemia can affect hepatic clearance, section 4.2 in the SmPC includes the warning that caution is 
recommended while using Orkambi in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less 
than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease. The current recommendations for impaired renal 
function are adequate for the new formulation in the 6 – 11 year old age group.  
In the original dossier, study 010 was conducted to evaluate PK after lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination 
therapy in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, according to Child-Pugh B classification. The impact 
of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) on the PK of lumacaftor given in combination with ivacaftor has 
not been studied, but the increase in exposure is expected to be less than 50%. Therefore, no dose 
adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Following multiple doses of lumacaftor 
in combination with ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh 
B) had higher exposures (AUCτ by approximately 50% and Cmax by approximately 30%) compared with 
healthy subjects matched for demographics. The SmPC therefore recommends dose reduction by 25% for 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C); however, exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment, Orkambi is 
recommended to be used with caution at a maximum dose of lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg total 
daily dose in patients 12 years and older, or lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg total daily dose in 
children 6 to 11 years of age, given as one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening.  
The same recommendations are therefore made for the two age groups: a 25% reduction in total daily 
dose in moderate hepatic impairment and to be used with caution in severe hepatic impairment, to a 
maximum total daily dose 50% of that normally recommended, given as one tablet twice a day. The table 
with recommendations for dose modifications in hepatic impairment in section 4.2 of the SmPC has been 
suitably amended. In addition to the potential effect on drug clearance of hepatic impairment, the 
possibility of drug-related hepatic toxicity has also been considered.  This is discussed further in section 
2.6. 
In the 6 – 11 year old patients studied in 011B and 109, slightly more female compared with male patients 
were studied (95 girls versus 70 boys). Literature data indicate that females with CF tend to fare worse 
than males in terms of clinical course of disease and females die on average 2- 3 years earlier than males 
with CF. LUM/IVA exposure was similar in boys and girls. The vast majority of 6 – 11 year old patients 
studied thus far were white Caucasian with only one patient from a different racial background represented 
in study 109. Cystic fibrosis is more common in Caucasian patients than in those of African or Asian racial 
origin and the prevalence of the F508del CFTR homozygous genotype is even lower in non-Causcasian 
compared to Caucasian patients. The available PK data suggest similar exposure LUM and IVA exposure 
profiles in non-Caucasian patients; the data are limited but reflective of the low incidence of patients 
homozygous for   F508del CFTR in the non-Caucasian population.   
Assessment report  
EMA/781319/2017 
Page 23/74 
  
  
The median survival for patients with CF born in 2014 is 40.0 years.  The oldest individual studied was 57 
years of age. Data in older patients 65 years and over are therefore not available. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Lumacaftor is presumed to partially overcome the folding defect in F508del-CFTR, facilitating its correct 
cellular processing and trafficking, allowing the protein to reach the cell surface, where it exhibits 
improved chloride channel function compared to uncorrected F508del-CFTR. The channel gating activity of 
F508del-CFTR delivered to the cell surface by lumacaftor can be potentiated by ivacaftor to further 
enhance chloride transport. When added in vitro to F508del/F508del human bronchial epithelial cells 
(HBE), the magnitude of chloride transport observed with the combination of lumacaftor and either acute 
or chronic ivacaftor treatment was greater than that observed with lumacaftor alone. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology: Study 011B evaluated change from baseline sweat chloride, accepted as a 
pharmacodynamic readout of CFTR function, in response to LUM/IVA treatment. There was an 
improvement (reduction) in sweat chloride by Day 15 that was sustained through Week 24.  The LS mean 
absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week 24 was -24.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -29.1, -20.5; 
P<0.0001). The magnitude of the change from baseline in sweat chloride, with reversal on treatment 
discontinuation supports a relevant pharmacodynamic effect, consistent with at least partial correction of 
the core biochemical defect and the proposed mechanism of action for the fixed drug combination, in the 6 
– 11 years age group at the proposed posology.  
In Study 011B BMI, weight and height increased from baseline consistent with improved pancreatic 
function and improved nutritional status. Treatment with LUM/IVA resulted in favourable changes in the 
CFQ-R respiratory domain score (Version: “Children Ages 6 to 11”). The LS mean absolute change from 
baseline in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score at Week 24 was 5.4 points (95% CI: 1.4, 9.4; P = 
0.0085). CFQ-R is the best validated of the patient reported outcomes in cystic fibrosis. CFQ-R is a 
symptom rather than Quality of Life Score which is more difficult to assess in the paediatric population. 
According to the report from the Workshop on Endpoints in Cystic Fibrosis clinical trials 
(EMA/769571/2012) the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is 4 in patients with stable 
disease. 
The spirometry endpoint ppFEV1 was evaluated as a safety as well as PD endpoint due to concerns over 
the observation of a transient bronchoconstrictive effect of Orkambi in adolescents and adults, in case this 
may be more pronounced in younger children with smaller diameter airways.  There was an overall 
improvement from baseline in ppFEV1 by 24 weeks, suggesting the potential for some degree of reversal 
of lung function deficit in patients at an earlier stage of disease. However, there was also a transient 
decline in mean ppFEV1 between 4 and 8 weeks although this was not substantial (between 1 and 2 
percentage points); nonetheless, the decline was potentially clinically significant in some patients. By 16 
weeks the mean ppFEV1 had recovered to higher than baseline values and continued to demonstrate some 
improvement beyond this. There was an overall low rate of treatment discontinuation in study 011B (2 
Assessment report  
EMA/781319/2017 
Page 24/74 
  
  
patients discontinued due to AEs) and therefore the PD outcome at 24 weeks can be considered to reflect 
the study population as a whole. 
Study 011B allowed the inclusion of subjects with ppFEV1 at screening ≥  40 (compared to study 109 
where ppFEV1 ≥  70 was an inclusion criterion). Although subjects with lower ppFEV1 values at baseline 
might be considered more susceptible to an initial bronchoconstrictive effect, it is also possible that 
patients with lower baseline values could be less sensitive to revelation of decline over a short time period. 
In the applicant’s response during the evaluation, it was clarified that only 3 subjects had a baseline 
ppFEV1 <70 and there was no evidence of a trend suggesting they were more likely to experience 
bronchoconstriction on treatment initiation, which was reassuring. 
The multiple breath washout (MBW) test lung clearance index LCI 2.5 was evaluated as an exploratory 
endpoint. The guideline on clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008-corr* recommends FEV 1 as an efficacy endpoint. However, the report from 
the Workshop on Endpoints in Cystic Fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012) acknowledges that in 
younger patients with milder disease, and in whom respiratory function as determined by spirometry may 
not have begun to decline, FEV1 may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a treatment effect. Indeed, this 
is suggested by the ppFEV1 results in study 011B which were nonetheless overall encouraging in 
suggesting potential for improvement in respiratory function. The same report also recommends that in 
younger patients, a more sensitive endpoint such as LCI should be evaluated, although the limited clinical 
experience of this as an outcome measure, and the lack of an established clinically relevant magnitude of 
benefit, are also acknowledged. There was a clear decline (reflecting improvement) in LCI2.5 from baseline 
through to 24 weeks (LS mean change from baseline -0.94 (95% CI: -1.38, -0.51; P = 0.0002) through 
Week 24 which is consistent with the trend to improvement in ppFEV1 over the same period. The 
improvement in LCI was sustained at least in the early phase of the washout period. Overall, the 
exploratory PD and efficacy data from study 011B provide support that the new FDC of Orkambi at the 
proposed posology acts in a manner  consistent with the primary pharmacology  in this patient population.      
Secondary pharmacology: Secondary pharmacology studies were confined to study of the effects of the 
combination LUM/IVA on QTc. These were evaluated in the initial marketing authorisation application. In 
the context of the line extension, mean IVA Cmax concentrations in 6 – 11 year olds in study 109, despite 
being approximately two fold higher than children 12 years and above administered with the age 
appropriate posology, are more than 5 fold lower than IVA Cmax concentrations in the dedicated IVA tQT 
study (0.821 versus 5.45 µg per ml). Mean LUM Cmax concentrations in 6 to 11 year old CF patients 
receiving an age appropriate dose of LUM/IVA are approximately two fold lower than those in the LUM/IVA 
tQT healthy volunteer study. The tQT study findings are therefore applicable to 6-11 year old CF patients 
receiving the age-appropriate formulation of Orkambi. 
Pharmacokinetic /pharmacodynamic relationship  
Pharmacokinetic /pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling data (patients 12 years and above) showed a 
linear relationship for FEV1 and lumacaftor concentration. It was concluded that it was not possible to 
study the effects of the mono-components in the model. The effect on FEV1 appeared moderate and the 
effect of the covariates did not seem to be significant. No additional PK-PD modelling data has been 
provided in the line extension. Although LUM and IVA exposures are comparable in the two age ranges 
administered with the appropriate combination, the applicant was requested by the CHMP to provide PK-

PD modelling data for the relationship between the primary efficacy endpoint, LCI 2.5, selected for the 
pivotal study, and exposure to LUM and IVA if this is available or to justify its absence.  
Results in CF patients 12 years and older showed a linear relationship between FEV1 and lumacaftor 
plasma concentration. No exposure-response (E-R) trends have been identified between LUM and IVA 
exposure and change from baseline in lung clearance index (LCI) in the 6-11 year old patients.  Exposure-
efficacy data for LCI 2.5 in 6 – 11 year olds are limited as a single dose was evaluated. Furthermore, 
plasma exposure may be poorly reflective of active substance concentrations at the target sites, given that 
the site of action of Orkambi (lumacaftor) is likely to be at least in part intracellular and therefore 
pharmacological activity will ultimately be governed by levels inside the cell, this in turn being influenced 
by regulation of cellular uptake and retention as well as plasma concentrations. Furthermore, an efficacy 
endpoint with greater sensitivity such as LCI 2.5 is more likely to reveal variability in efficacy-exposure 
particularly in a relatively small sample.  The lack of a demonstrable exposure-efficacy response for LCI 2.5 
is considered overridden by the overall efficacy conclusions, which is acceptable for the CHMP. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of Orkambi in the new FDC in the age range proposed in the line extension is 
overall supported by the data provided. Although the use of two different exponents for allometric scaling 
across paediatric subpopulations is not recommended, if the popPK model is developed to include children 
below 6 years of age, the MAH is encouraged to use the same allometric exponent for all paediatric age 
groups. The CHMP was of the opinion that that the CYP3A induction mediated via lumacaftor and affecting 
the ivacaftor CL should be adequately described in the model to ensure that the allometric exponent, if 
estimated, is not confounded by any effect of induction but solely reflects the effect of weight on CL. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data provided for this extension of indication of Orkambi for use in children 6-11 
years old is considered adequate by CHMP.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
A single confirmatory efficacy and safety study VX14-809-109 (abbreviated to study 109) is provided to 
support the extension of indication to the 6 to 11 years age group. The exploratory PD study 011B 
described below provides supportive efficacy data.  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study 011 (parts A and B), discussed in section 2.4, was used to inform dosing regimen for the pivotal 
efficacy study 109 for the line extension in 6-11 year olds.  In study 011 CF subjects, 6-11 years old, were 
treated for 2 weeks (Part A, 10 subjects)) or for 24 weeks (Part B, 58 subjects) twice daily with 200 mg 
lumacaftor in combination with 250 mg ivacaftor. All subjects were homozygous for the mutation F508del-
CFTR. PK modelling was used to inform a 50% dose reduction for lumacaftor while maintaining the same 
dose of ivacaftor in the 6 – 11 year old F508del-CFTR CF patients. The altered ratio of LUM:IVA is reflected 
in the new FDC of Orkambi (100 mg LUM/ 125 mg IVA) for use in the 6 – 11 year age group.

Study 011A and 011B provided PK, PD and safety and tolerability data to support adequacy of exposure to 
LUM and IVA with the new FDC formulation at the proposed posology in the 6 – 11 year age group, 
compared with F508del-CFTR CF patients 12 years and older administered with the age appropriate 
formulation. PK modelling was used to derive population-predicted data in the 6 – 11 year old age group. 
The reduction in the LUM:IVA ratio is supported by ivacaftor’s AUC in most 6-11 year old subjects 
remaining within the 5th to 95th percentile boundaries established in the older population, using the same 
dose of ivacaftor although it tended to be higher. Median AUC for IVA was 30% higher in 6 – 11 year olds 
compared to 12 – 17 year olds and 50% higher than in adults. Ivacaftor Ctrough was similar across all age 
groups.

At the Week 24 Visit of Study 109, subjects who completed study drug treatment and the visits in the Treatment Period were 
offered the opportunity to enroll in the Treatment Cohort of an optional open-label rollover study (Study 110) evaluating 
LUM/IVA for an additional 96 weeks. Subjects who permanently discontinued study drug treatment but who completed the 
visits in the Treatment Period were offered the opportunity to enroll in the Observational Cohort of the rollover study. 
Approximately 200 subjects were to be stratified by weight (<25 kg versus ≥25 kg) and percent predicted FEV1 severity  
(<90 versus ≥90), both as determined at the Screening Visit, and randomized (1:1) before the first dose of study drug on Day 
1 
The Extended Pretreatment Assessment Period was included for subjects at a subset of sites participating in the Imaging 
Substudy. 
Study Participants  
Subjects were 6 – 11 years old, males and females, with a confirmed diagnosis of CF defined as 2 CF-
causing mutations in addition to either chronic sinopulmonary disease and/or gastrointestinal/nutritional 
abnormalities. Subjects were homozygous for F508del-CFTR. Genotyping was performed using a validated 
CF genotyping test. Enrolment was limited to subjects with LCI2.5 result ≥ 7.5 at the Screening Visit 
(normal value <7.5). Spirometry at baseline (ppFEV1) could be normal (pp FEV 1 >70). Subjects with a 
history of any illness or condition that could confound study results or pose an additional safety risk (e.g., 
cirrhosis with portal hypertension, risk factors for Torsades de Pointes) were excluded from Study 109. 
Subjects with protocol-defined laboratory values indicative of clinically significant abnormal liver or renal 
function were also excluded (any of ≥ 3 x ULN two or more of AST, ALT, GGT, ALP; ≥ 5 x ULN ALT or AST; 
total bilirubin >2 × ULN; GFR ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculated by the Counahan-Barratt equation). These 
criteria were comparable to studies 103 and 104.  
Treatments 
The active treatment was LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg q12h. It was recommended that subjects remain on a 
stable CF medication regimen from 4 weeks before Day 1 through Week 24 or, if applicable, through the 
Safety Follow-up Visit. Information about bronchodilator use was collected and documented. Subjects who 
used a bronchodilator had their spirometry assessments performed according to the guidelines specified in 
the protocol. Other concomitant medications were prohibited if the potential existed for untoward drug-
drug interactions, such as strong CYP3A4 inducers and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate efficacy of LUM/IVA in subjects aged 6 through 11 years with CF, 
homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation.  
Secondary objectives were:  
• 
• 
To evaluate the safety of LUM/IVA  
To investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LUM and its metabolite (M28-LUM) and IVA and its 
metabolites (M1-IVA and M6-IVA)

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Study 109 evaluated absolute change in CI2.5 from baseline as the primary 
endpoint. The primary efficacy analysis compared the change from baseline LCI2.5 in active and placebo 
arms.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints are listed in the table above and included  analyses of lung function (LCI and 
spirometry), sweat chloride, nutritional indices (body mass index [BMI], weight, height, and associated z-
scores for each), Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised [CFQ-R] responses, Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication [TSQM] responses, and clinical events related to outcomes (e.g., PExs). 
Other evaluations included analyses of faecal elastase-1 (FE-1), immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), and 
sputum microbiology. An exploratory evaluation of imaging results was also included. 
ppFEV1 was a secondary endpoint (expressed as percent predicted value based on age, height, and sex) 
because it was expected that the majority of subjects would have well-preserved spirometry at baseline. 
ppFEV1 values were calculated from regression equations derived from a healthy reference population to 
allow the comparison of values over time for a growing individual and across subjects. The Wang reference 
equations were selected because the reference values across the studied ages are estimated more 
precisely and accurately. Spirometry was performed according to the internationally-recognized American 
Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Guidelines.41 Furthermore and were performed before 
inhalation of a bronchodilator to minimize confounding effects on FEV1.  
The sweat chloride test was included as an in vivo PD measure of the effect of LUM/IVA on CFTR activity. 
Collection of sweat samples was performed using an approved collection device. At each time point, 2 
samples were collected, 1 sample from each arm (left and right).

BMI was measured to assess nutritional status and is recognised as an appropriate endpoint for therapies 
targeting pancreatic insufficiency as well as systemic therapies targeting the biochemical defect in the 
CFTR.  
The CFQ-R is a validated CF-specific instrument that measures the health-related quality of life of patients 
with CF. The CFQ-R measures quality-of-life domains including respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, 
emotion, and health perception. CFQ-R has been evaluated in clinical studies involving therapies for CF 
lung disease. CFQ-R assessments were performed in a standardized manner. The CFQ-R was completed 
before the start of any assessments, including other questionnaires. Two versions of the CFQ-R were used: 
1 in which the information was self-reported in an interviewer format (“Children Ages 6 to 11”) and 1 in 
which the subject’s parent or caregiver was the respondent (“Parents/Caregivers”). The “Children Ages 6 
to 11” version is the primary version in this age group. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) 
score of 4.0 corresponds to the adolescent/adult version of the CFQ-R respiratory domain (subjects 14 
years of age and older). 
TSQM (Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication) is a widely used generic measure of 
satisfaction with medication. It was originally validated in a sample of patients with a variety of chronic 
conditions, but has been demonstrated to be a valid and reliable measure of satisfaction in patients with 
CF. TSQM domains measure effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction. Because 
treatment satisfaction is not measured with the other health-related quality-of-life measures evaluated in 
Study 109, the TSQM was included as a study assessment. 
CF pulmonary exacerbations (PExs) are a combination of signs and symptoms that often herald a need for 
aggressive treatment including IV antibiotics and may require hospitalisation. PExs are the major cause of 
morbidity and decreased quality of life for patients with CF. The number of events, estimates of event 
rates, time-to-onset, and the duration of PExs including those involving hospitalizations and IV antibiotic 
therapy are clinically important endpoints to both clinicians managing patients with CF and the patients 
themselves. However, PEx events are less common in children than adults, and therefore it is more 
difficult to identify an effect of treatment on this endpoint in younger subjects. 
There is no generally accepted definition of a PEx and large multicentre CF clinical studies have used 
various physician-derived definitions. For data consistency, a single definition of PEx was specified for 
Study 109, based on that used for other studies including Studies 103 and 104 and initial IVA registration 
studies. PEx was defined as a new or change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) for any 4 or more 
of the following signs or symptoms: change in sputum; new or increased haemoptysis; increased cough; 
increased dyspnoea; malaise, fatigue, or lethargy; temperature above 38°C (equivalent to approximately 
100.4°F); anorexia or weight loss; sinus pain or tenderness; change in sinus discharge; change in physical 
examination of the chest; decrease in lung function by at least 10%; or radiographic changes indicative of 
pulmonary infection. 
Sample size 
The sample size was pre-specified as 200 subjects and with this, 100 subjects/arm and 10% missing 
data/dropout rate, the study had approximately 90% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.68 at a 
2-sided 0.05 significance level, assuming a standard deviation of 1.4 based on VX10-770-106 data. The 
sample size of 35 subjects planned for the Imaging Substudy was driven by feasibility considerations. No 
formal sample size calculation was performed.

Randomisation 
200 subjects, who met the eligibility criteria, were to be randomised (1:1) to 1 of the 2 treatment arms, 
stratified by weight (<25 kg versus ≥ 25 kg) and ppFEV1 severity (<90 versus ≥ 90), as determined at the 
Screening Visit. Randomisation occurred after all inclusion and exclusion criteria were met and before the 
first dose of study drug. Randomisation may have occurred on Day -1. 
Blinding (masking) 
Subjects and all site personnel, including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team, were 
blinded, with the exception of study personnel identified in the protocol. Subjects and their 
parent/caregiver were not informed of their study-related LCI, spirometry, sweat chloride, and imaging 
results during the study regardless of whether the subject had prematurely discontinued treatment. 
Unblinding of an individual subject’s treatment by the investigator was limited to medical emergencies or 
urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject’s study treatment was necessary for clinical 
management. Procedures for unblinding were provided in the protocol. Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) 
or designee was permitted to unblind any serious AE (SAE) reports in compliance with regulatory reporting 
requirements. In addition, Vertex were able, for matters relating to safety concerns, to unblind individual 
subjects at any time. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) was developed and finalised before database lock. The following analysis 
sets were defined:  
•  All Subjects Set was defined as all subjects who were randomised or dosed (i.e., all subjects in the 
study). All subject data listings were referenced using the All Subjects Set, unless otherwise 
specified. 
• 
• 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomised subjects who were exposed to any amount of study 
drug. The treatment assignment for the FAS was as randomised. 
The FAS was used for all efficacy analyses, except the endpoints related to imaging assessments. 
•  Safety Set included all subjects who were exposed to any amount of study drug. The treatment 
assignment for the Safety Set was as treated. For subjects who received study drug from placebo 
and active treatment groups during the trial, the treatment group allocation for as-treated analysis 
• 
• 
was the active treatment group. 
The Safety Set was used for all safety analysis. 
Imaging Substudy Set was defined as a subset of FAS who or whose caregiver consented to the 
Imaging Substudy per supplemental informed consent and assent. The Imaging Substudy Set was 
used for the analysis related to imaging assessments. 
Efficacy analyses were performed using the FAS. Analyses were performed for the following primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints: (1) absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24; (2) average 
absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at Day 15 and at Week 4; (3) absolute change in BMI 
from baseline at Week 24; (4) absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score from baseline through

Week 24; (5) absolute change in LCI5.0 from baseline through Week 24; (6) absolute change in sweat 
chloride from baseline at Week 24; (7) absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24; (8) 
relative change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24; (9) absolute change in BMI-for-age z-score 
from baseline at Week 24; (10) absolute change in weight from baseline at Week 24; (11) absolute 
change in weight-for-age z-score from baseline at Week 24; (12) absolute change in height from baseline 
at Week 24; (13) absolute change in height-for-age z-score from baseline at Week 24; (14) absolute 
change in TSQM domains from baseline through Week 24; (15) time-to-first PEx through Week 24; (16) 
event of having at least 1 PEx through Week 24; and (17) number of PExs through Week 24. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5, was analysed using a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model included the absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline 
(including all measurements up to Week 24 [inclusive], both on-treatment measurements and 
measurements after treatment discontinuation) as the dependent variable; treatment, visit, and 
treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects; and subject as a random effect with adjustment for weight 
(<25 kg versus ≥ 25 kg) and ppFEV1 severity (<90 versus ≥ 90), both as determined at the Screening 
Visit, and the baseline LCI2.5 as a continuous variable. The primary result obtained from the model was 
the absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5 through Week 24. 
Analyses for secondary endpoints 2, 4 through 6, and 12 through 14 were based on an MMRM analysis 
similar to that used for the primary analysis, replacing baseline LCI2.5 with the baseline of the 
corresponding variable as a continuous covariate. Analyses for secondary endpoints 3 and 7 through 11 
were based on an MMRM analysis similar to that used for the primary analysis, removing baseline LCI2.5 
as a continuous covariate. 
Time-to-first PEx through Week 24 was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. The incidence of subjects 
with at least 1 PEx through Week 24 was summarized and the Mantel-Hanszel estimate of the odds ratio 
and the corresponding 95% CI provided. For number of PExs through Week 24, the treatment comparison 
was carried out using regression analysis for a negative binomial distribution. 
Incomplete/Missing Data was not imputed, unless otherwise specified; i.e., all missing values remained as 
missing in all statistical analyses and listings, unless otherwise specified. Missing post-baseline values were 
not imputed for efficacy analysis conducted using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
approach, which made use of all available data even if a subject had missing data at some post-baseline 
visits. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In study 109, a total of 204 subjects were exposed to study drug, with 193 (94.6%) subjects completing 
treatment and 196 (96.1%) subjects completing the study. A total of 19 subjects participated in the 
Imaging Substudy. The treatment discontinuation rate was similar in the LUM/IVA (5.8%) and placebo 
(5.0%) groups. Overall, the most common reason for treatment discontinuation was an adverse event 
(AE) (2.5%). The treatment discontinuation rate due to AE was similar in the LUM/IVA (2.9%) and placebo 
(2.0%) groups.

Conduct of the study 
The majority of subjects (97.5%) used medication before receiving the first dose of study drug. The most 
common prior medications (≥ 30% incidence overall) were for CF management and included dornase alfa 
(86.3%), pancreatin (73.5%; pancrelipase was also used in 22.5% of subjects), sodium chloride (70.1%), 
and salbutamol (65.7%). The majority of subjects (99.5%) also used concomitant medication. The most 
common concomitant medications (≥ 30% incidence overall) were for CF management and included 
dornase alfa (86.8%), pancreatin (73.0%; pancrelipase was also used in 23.5% of subjects), sodium 
chloride (71.1%), salbutamol (67.6%), and azithromycin (34.8%). Subjects in the LUM/IVA group used 
vitamins not otherwise specified approximately 14% more frequently than the placebo group. Subjects in 
the placebo group used tobramycin and paracetamol approximately 10% to 13% more frequently than the 
LUM/IVA group. The use of all other concomitant medications was generally similar across the LUM/IVA 
and placebo groups. 
Protocol deviations: 15 (7.4%) subjects had an important protocol deviation IPD (8.7% of subjects in the 
LUM/IVA group and 5.9% of subjects in the placebo group). The IPDs included those related to meeting 
exclusion criteria 3 and 8 (1.9% of subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 2.0% of subjects in the placebo 
group), stratification errors (2.9% of subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 1.0% of subjects in the placebo 
group), and compliance/number of tablets taken <80% (5.8% of subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 3.0% 
of subjects in the placebo group). The protocol deviations are not likely to have affected the study 
outcome as deemed by the applicant and the CHMP.

Mean age- and sex-adjusted nutritional indices were -0.21 (weight-for-age z-score), -0.14 (BMI-for-age z-
score), and -0.14 (height-for-age z-score). Mean LCI2.5 was 10.28 (normal value: <7.5), mean sweat 
chloride was 103.0 mmol/L, and mean ppFEV1 was 89.8 percentage points. A total of 87 (42.6%) subjects 
were positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa at baseline. The baseline profile was generally similar across 
the LUM/IVA and placebo groups. Mean ppFEV1 was 88.8 in the LUM/IVA group versus 90.7 in the placebo 
group. The percentage of subjects who received inhaled antibiotics, inhaled corticosteroids, and inhaled 
hypertonic saline before the first dose was, respectively, 19.4%, 36.9%, and 65.0% in the LUM/IVA group 
versus 29.7%, 46.5%, and 53.5% in the placebo group. 
Numbers analysed 
The PK set contained data for 104 subjects. Day 1 samples for one subject were excluded from analysis as 
the pre-dose results were positive and the 3 to 6 hour results were below the lower limit of quantification. 
All efficacy analyses (except endpoints related to imaging assessments) were conducted using the FAS, 
which included 204 randomised subjects who were exposed to any amount of study drug. The CHMP noted 
that in accordance with the intention to treat principle the primary efficacy analysis should be conducted 
on all randomised subjects whether or not they received study medication. However, the all subjects set 
(ITT population) is very similar in number to the FAS (206 versus 204, with a difference of one patient in 
each arm). Given the similarity in ITT and FAS populations, execution of the primary efficacy analysis on 
the FAS is acceptable.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint – absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 24 
Treatment with LUM/IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement (i.e. a  reduction) in LCI2.5 
compared to placebo, with a LS mean treatment difference of -1.09 (95% CI, -1.43, -0.75) p<0.0001 for 
the absolute change through Week 24. 
A statistically significant improvement in LCI 2.5 was observed at Day 15 and sustained through Week 24. 
There was no treatment-by-visit interaction (P = 0.5174).

The percentage of missing data for the absolute change in LCI at Week 24 was 16.7%. The impact of 
missing data was assessed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with missing data imputed 
using multiple imputations (MI) as described in CSR 109 section 9.7.4.1.3. The results of the additional 
analysis were consistent with the results of the primary analysis. The MI-estimated treatment difference 
for the LUM/IVA group compared to the placebo group was -1.20 (P = 0.0008) for the absolute change in 
LCI2.5 at Week 24. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Average Absolute Change in Sweat Chloride  
LUM/IVA resulted in improvement (i.e., a reduction) in sweat chloride was demonstrated at  Day 15 and 
sustained through Week 24, with a LS mean treatment difference of -20.8 mmol/L (95% CI -23.4, -18.2; 
P<0.0001) for the average absolute change at Day 15 and at Week 4.

Absolute Change in BMI 
Treatment with LUM/IVA resulted in an improvement in BMI at Week 24, although this was not statistically 
significant compared to placebo. The LS mean treatment difference was 0.11 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.08, 0.31; 
P = 0.2522) for the absolute change in BMI at Week 24. 
Absolute Change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain 
Treatment with LUM/IVA resulted in an improvement in CFQ-R respiratory domain score (Version: Children 
Ages 6 to 11) through Week 24, although this was not statistically significant compared to placebo. The LS 
mean treatment difference was 2.5 points (95% CI -0.1, 5.1; P = 0.0628) for the absolute change in CFQ-
R respiratory domain score through Week 24. 
Absolute change in LCI 5.0  
LUM/IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement (i.e., a reduction) in LCI 5.0 compared to 
placebo, with a LS mean treatment difference of -0.44 (P<0.0001) for the absolute change through Week 
24. 
Absolute and Relative Changes in ppFEV1 
Treatment with LUM/IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 compared to placebo, 
with a LS mean treatment difference of 2.4 percentage points (CI 0.4, 4.4; P = 0.0182) for the absolute 
change through Week 24 and 3.2% (CI 0.6, 5.7; P = 0.0141) for the relative change through Week 24 
(Table 5 and Figure 8 below).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 109 was a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in CF patients aged 6 - 11 years, 
homozygous for the F508del-CFTR  mutation.

Efficacy, safety, and PK profiles for LUM/IVA in subjects 12 years of age and older, homozygous for 
F508del had previously been established (Studies 103 and 104). It is not uncommon for patients in the 6- 
to 11-year age group to have well-preserved or even normal spirometry (e.g., percent predicted forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second [ppFEV1]). However, even with normal spirometry, patients in this age 
group with severe CF-causing mutations already have pulmonary structural aberrations observed through 
computed tomography (CT) scans. Consistent with this, impaired lung clearance index (LCI), which 
measures the degree of small airway disease by assessing ventilation inhomogeneity, can be observed in 
paediatric patients with normal spirometry. These observations confirm that the disease process that 
results from a lack of CFTR activity begins early in life and before lung function as assessed by spirometry 
is affected. Because the underlying genetic and molecular aetiology of the disease is consistent between 
this age group and older patients, it was anticipated that LUM/IVA would be efficacious in this population 
as well. 
Subjects were 6 – 11 years old, males and females, with a confirmed diagnosis of CF defined as 2 CF-
causing mutations in addition to either chronic sinopulmonary disease and/or gastrointestinal / nutritional 
abnormalities. Subjects were homozygous for F508del-CFTR. Genotyping was performed using a validated 
CF genotyping test. These criteria were the same in Studies 103 and 104. Even in patients with CF 
mutations on two alleles, recently published CF consensus recommendations for diagnosis of CF (Farrell 
PM, White TB, Ren CL et al. 2017) specify that sweat chloride should be at least 30 mmol/L (i.e., sweat 
chloride testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis in subjects with two CF-causing mutations) whereas 
a previous recommendation was that sweat chloride should be above 60 mmol/L. The baseline data on 
sweat chloride show that values range between 64.5 to 123.0 mmol/L in the placebo group and between 
46.0 and 119.0 in the lum/iva group, which is consistent with a CF diagnosis according to the most recent 
recommendations. Enrolment was limited to subjects with LCI 2.5  ≥ 7.5 at the Screening Visit, reflective of 
uneven ventilation and small airways disease.(Normal value <7.5). Spirometry at baseline (ppFEV1) could 
be normal (pp FEV1 >70). Subjects with a history of any illness or condition that could confound study 
results or pose an additional safety risk were excluded. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
considered appropriate by the CHMP.  
104 subjects were randomised to receive LUM 200 / IVA 250 mg q12h and 102 subjects to receive 
placebo-matched control, for a period of 24 weeks. There was an overall low rate of discontinuation that 
was similar in the LUM/IVA (5.8%) and placebo (5.0%) groups. Patient demographics were overall well 
balanced between treatment arms for age (at screening, median 9 yrs in both, range 6 – 11yrs), weight 
and height.  
In study 109 there were more females than males (59.3% versus 40.7%), despite males tending to be 
represented in high numbers than females in all CF age groups.  Numbers of males and females were 
balanced between treatment arms, however females are known to fare worse than males in the clinical 
course of CF although the survival disadvantage in females is more apparent in the older age groups as 
one would expect. The vast majority of subjects were white (96.1%).   
Baseline disease severity and pulmonary function abnormality were overall balanced between treatment 
arms.  Baseline sweat chloride levels in both groups are compatible with CF. ppFEV1 ≥  70 was an 
inclusion criterion in study 109 although a few patients had values lower than this, more in the active 
treatment arm which would have tended to favour placebo.  
Study conduct was overall acceptable and there were no protocol deviations likely to have affected the 
conclusions of the study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/781319/2017 
Page 45/74 
  
  
The primary efficacy endpoint was absolute change in LCI 2.5 from baseline. The primary analysis was a 
between-group comparison between placebo and active treatments of change from baseline in LCI 2.5 
through 24 weeks.  
Study 109 evaluated  LCI  2.5 as the primary endpoint whereas studies 103 and 104 in the 12 years and 
older population evaluated ppFEV1 as the primary endpoint. Reduction reflects improvement in ventilation 
homogeneity.  
The Report from the Workshop on Endpoints in Cystic Fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012) 
acknowledges that in younger patients with milder disease, and in whom respiratory function as 
determined by spirometry may not have begun to decline, FEV1 may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect 
a treatment effect. The report from the workshop recommends instead that in younger patients, a more 
sensitive endpoint such as LCI should be evaluated, although the limited clinical experience of this as an 
outcome measure, and the lack of an established clinically relevant magnitude of benefit, are also 
acknowledged.  
Even in the presence of normal spirometry, as is often the case in the younger patients, investigation of 
potential disease-modifying treatments in CF is encouraged in the hope of slowing disease progression and 
preventing or delaying permanent lung parenchymal damage in addition to other organ damage such as 
biliary cirrhosis and pancreatic damage.   
LCI2.5 is the most commonly used multiple breath washout test (MBW) parameter. LCI2.5 measures the 
number of lung turnovers required to reduce the end tidal inert gas concentration to 1/40th of its starting 
value. It is a sensitive outcome measure appropriate to this patient population and also more likely to 
reveal differences in ventilation homogeneity than LCI5.0 which measures   the number of lung turnovers 
required to reduce the end tidal inert gas concentration to 1/20th of its starting value. LCI5.0 was 
evaluated as a secondary endpoint. Although LCI is encouraged as an efficacy variable in younger CF 
patients, there are limited clinical data to validate clinical relevance of an effect.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included  analyses of lung function (LCI and spirometry), sweat chloride, 
nutritional indices (body mass index [BMI], weight, height, and associated z-scores for each), Cystic 
Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised [CFQ-R] responses, Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication 
[TSQM] responses, and clinical events related to outcomes (e.g., PExs). Other evaluations included 
analyses of faecal elastase-1 (FE-1), immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), and sputum microbiology. An 
exploratory evaluation of imaging results was also included. 
Efficacy analyses were performed using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The primary efficacy endpoint, 
absolute change from baseline in LCI 2.5 through Week 24, was analysed using a mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) which made use of all available data even if a subject had missing data at some post-
baseline visits. The model included the absolute change in LCI 2.5 from baseline (including all 
measurements up to Week 24 [inclusive], both on-treatment measurements and measurements after 
treatment discontinuation) as the dependent variable; treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction 
as fixed effects; and subject as a random effect with adjustment for weight (<25 kg versus ≥ 25 kg) and 
ppFEV1 severity (<90 versus ≥ 90), both as determined at the Screening Visit, and the baseline LCI2.5 as 
a continuous variable. Analyses for secondary endpoints 2, 4 through 6, and 12 through 14 were based on 
an MMRM analysis similar to that used for the primary analysis.

EMA/781319/2017 
Page 46/74 
  
  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change from baseline in LCI 2.5 from baseline through 
week 24, active versus placebo comparison of treatment difference. The primary endpoint was met in 
demonstrating a statistically significant treatment difference for LUM/IVA versus placebo, in favour of 
LUM/IVA, for the efficacy variable absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 24. There was a 
LS mean treatment difference of -1.09 (95% CI, -1.43, -0.75) p<0.0001 for the absolute change through 
Week 24. 
The size of the treatment effect appears small. However, there are limited data from trials using this 
endpoint and a MCID has not yet been defined. Effect sizes in studies have ranged from -1 to -2 
depending on the type of intervention and the duration of treatment (Amin 2010, Thorax; Amin 2011, Eur 
Respir J; Davies 2012, American Thoracic Society International Conference. San Francisco). Limited 
longitudinal data from the placebo group of interventional trials are available to define whether an 
intervention exceeds the intrinsic variability of the test. The report from the recent workshop on endpoints 
in clinical trials nonetheless considers this endpoint sufficiently established for trials in CF patients 6 – 11 
years of age. 
There was a high percentage of missing data (16.7%) for the absolute change in LCI at week 24. It was 
clarified that the majority of missing assessments for LCI were missing due to technical unacceptability 
(fewer than 2 acceptable values) on the evaluation of a blinded adjudicator. At Week 24, 26 subjects had 
technically unacceptable LCI values compared with 21 – 27 subjects at other visits. The primary analysis 
was an MMRM analysis that averaged the treatment effect through week 24. A supportive analysis was 
conducted using an ANCOVA model with missing data imputed which was consistent with the primary 
analysis.  
The LCI and spirometry measurements were calculated centrally without knowledge of preceding values 
which had been scrambled to maintain blinding. There was an overall low rate of treatment discontinuation 
that was similar in LUM/IVA and placebo groups. 
There were approximately 20% more females than males in study 109, whereas males tend to be more 
represented in the CF population at large. Subgroup analysis by gender suggests a bigger treatment 
difference between LUM/IVA and placebo in females than males (LS mean difference  -1.23; 95% CI -
1.72, -0.73, p < 0.0001 in females; and LS mean difference -0.88, 95% CI -1.33, -0.42, p < 0.0003 in 
males). The homogeneity of the treatment effect across subgroups (including sex) was evaluated in a 
mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis by testing each treatment-by-subgroup 
interaction in the corresponding model. In Study 109, there were no treatment-by-subgroup interactions 
that were statistically significant. The lack of a statistically significant treatment by gender interaction 
(p=0.1654) does not exclude one, given that the test was not powered to reveal an interaction. Although 
subgroup analysis revealed an apparently greater treatment response in females compared with males, 
males nonetheless demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in LCI relative to placebo that can 
be considered clinically relevant.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints: Average absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at Day 15 and at 
Week 4 was specified in the SAP as one of three key secondary efficacy endpoints. LUM/IVA resulted in 
improvement (i.e., a reduction) in sweat chloride at  Day 15 and sustained through Week 24, with a LS 
mean treatment difference of -20.8 mmol/L (95% CI -23.4, -18.2; P<0.0001) for the average absolute 
change at Day 15 and at Week 4. There is no discussion in the SAP of a pre-specified hierarchy for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/781319/2017 
Page 47/74 
  
  
secondary efficacy endpoints and therefore statistical significance is regarded as nominal for all secondary 
endpoints.   
The reduction in sweat chloride is consistent with restoration of the biochemical defect and with the 
combined corrector/potentiator action of LUM/IVA. Although the mean reduction of ~ 20 mmol/L was quite 
rapid and marked, the decline levelled off with no evidence of ongoing decline. The decline in mean sweat 
chloride to ~ 80 mmol/L is still substantially higher than normal range for sweat chloride (< 30 mmol/L). 
References were provided to support, from natural history data, that improvement in CFTR function by 10-
20%, in patients homozygous for F508del, would be expected to result in clinically meaningful benefit. It is 
clarified that no patients achieved normalisation of sweat chloride.  
There was a trend to improvement in BMI in favour of LUM/IVA but it is difficult to assess whether this 
reflects improved nutritional status from improved pancreatic function, without additional supportive 
evidence. At baseline, mean age- and sex-adjusted nutritional indices were -0.21 (weight-for-age z-score), 
-0.14 (BMI-for-age z-score), and -0.14 (height-for-age z-score), reflecting that some patients were under-
nourished at study entry and who may be more sensitive to revelation of increase in BMI due to improved 
nutritional status. Although the absolute change from baseline BMI in subjects with a BMI z-score <0 was 
similar in the LUM/IVA and placebo groups over 24 weeks of treatment, responder analysis in subjects 
with a BMI z-score <0 showed that the percentage with a BMI value ≥ 50th percentile at Week 24 was 
higher in the LUM/IVA group (9 [14.8%] subjects) than in the placebo group (4 [7.7%] subjects). This 
supports that LUM/IVA has a positive effect on nutritional parameters in undernourished children. 
There was a numerical improvement in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through Week 24 with a treatment 
difference compared to placebo of 2.5 points which is less than the MCID of 4 points in patients 14 years 
and older. Given that the patient population was at a relatively early stage of disease, patient reported 
outcome such as this would be relatively insensitive to detect a treatment benefit and therefore although 
this is a validated PRO in CF, the lack of clear benefit over placebo is not considered to be of major 
concern. 
Of the three key secondary efficacy endpoints, only one (sweat chloride) demonstrated a statistically 
significant (nominal) difference for LUM/IVA versus placebo but the clinical relevance of this magnitude of 
reduction is unclear. The other key secondary efficacy endpoints were consistent with a trend to 
improvement, recognising that definitive efficacy improvement is difficult to demonstrate in a patient 
population with relatively mild disease at baseline. Although study 011B arguably more clearly 
demonstrated clinically relevant change from baseline across secondary efficacy endpoints, the patients 
had more impaired respiratory function at baseline and may as a population have been more sensitive to 
revelation of benefit over a relatively short time scale. Study 011B was uncontrolled but provides some 
support for clinical relevance of efficacy benefit.  The documented efficacy benefit for LUM/IVA in 12 years 
and older patients, albeit in a different posology, is also supportive.  
The ppFEV1 was evaluated as a supportive secondary efficacy endpoint in study 109 for the reasons 
outlined i.e. the 6 – 11 year old population is likely to be relatively insensitive to revelation of benefit when 
baseline spirometry is frequently normal. Nonetheless, in study 011B patients had lower baseline ppFEV1 
compared to  study 109 and in study 011B, there was some evidence of improvement in ppFEV1 at week 
24 suggesting the potential for some reversal of lung function deficit.  
The possibility of improvement in pulmonary architecture by lung imaging in patients with normal 
spirometry can be further explored, i.e. in a small number of subjects in study 109 exploratory lung 
imaging was performed. There was evidence of reduced bronchiectasis, mucous plugging, peribronchial 
Assessment report  
EMA/781319/2017 
Page 48/74 
  
  
thickening, and hyperinflation based on CT and reduced bronchiectasis, mucous plugging, and 
peribronchial thickening based on UTE MRI although the numbers are too small to draw definitive 
conclusions. Nonetheless, this provides some support that the trend to improvement in ppFEV1 by 24 
weeks may reflect potential for improvement as well as slowing of disease progression. Exploratory 
pulmonary imaging will be continued as a substudy in the long term study 110 in 6 – 11 year olds. If 
beneficial effect on pulmonary architecture can be confirmed, this would support introduction of correction 
therapy at earlier stages of disease.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the CHMP considered that clinical efficacy has been sufficiently demonstrated in CF patients 
homozygous for F509del-CFTR aged 6 – 11 years administered with the new FDC combination of Orkambi 
at the proposed posology.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Study 109: 204 subjects were exposed to study drug, 193 (94.6%) subjects completed treatment, and 
196 (96.1%) subjects completed the study. The treatment discontinuation rate was similar in the LUM/IVA 
(5.8%) and placebo (5.0%) groups. Overall, the most common reason for treatment discontinuation was 
an AE (2.5%). The treatment discontinuation rate due to AE was similar in the LUM/IVA (2.9%) and 
placebo (2.0%) groups. The overall mean exposure duration was 161.7 days, and the majority of subjects 
(95.6%) received >16 weeks of study drug exposure. The mean exposure duration was similar in the 
LUM/IVA (160.1 days) and placebo (163.3 days) groups. 
Studies 011B and 110: In Study 011B, 58 subjects were enrolled and exposed to study drug. A total of 54 
(93.1%) subjects completed treatment. In the Study 110 Cumulative Study Period, 58 subjects received 
at least 1 dose of study drug, and the mean exposure was 438.6 days (62.7 weeks). A total of 28 (48.3%) 
subjects received ≥ 48 to <72 weeks of treatment, and 21 (36.2%) subjects received ≥ 72 to <96 weeks 
of treatment. 
Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent adverse events 
TEAEs were defined as any AE that increased in severity or that developed upon or after the initial dosing 
of study drug to 28 days after the last dose of study drug (referred to as AEs). 
Study 109: A total of 81 (39.7%) subjects had at least 1 AE considered related to the study drug (related 
[0.5%] or possibly related [39.2%], as determined by the investigator). The majority of subjects had AEs 
that were considered mild (87 [42.6%] subjects) or moderate (98 [48.0%] subjects) in severity. Eleven 
(5.4%) subjects had AEs that were severe. No life-threatening AEs occurred. Twelve (5.9%) subjects had 
AEs that led to treatment interruption (9 [8.7%] subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 3 [3.0%] subjects in 
Assessment report  
EMA/781319/2017 
Page 49/74 
  
  
 
the placebo group). A total of 5 (2.5%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation (3 [2.9%] 
subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 2 [2.0%] subjects in the placebo group). A total of 24 (11.8%) 
subjects had serious adverse events (SAEs) (13 [12.6%] subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 11 [10.9%] 
subjects in the placebo group), 5 of whom had an SAE considered related to study drug (2 [1.9%] 
subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 3 [3.0%] subjects in the placebo group). No subjects had an AE with 
an outcome of death. 
Studies 011B and 110: During the Cumulative Study Period, 56 (96.6%) subjects had at least 1 AE, the 
majority of who had AEs that were considered mild (24.1%) or moderate (62.1%) in severity. Ten 
(17.2%) subjects had at least 1 SAE. No subjects had an AE that led to death. Across AE categories, the 
exposure-adjusted numbers of events were generally similar or lower in the Study 110 Period than during 
the initial 24 weeks of treatment in Study 011B. 
Common adverse events  
Study 109: AEs with a frequency of ≥ 5% at the preferred term (PT) level in any treatment group are 
summarized by system organ class (SOC) and PT. The most common AEs (≥ 10% incidence overall at the 
PT level) were cough, infective PEx of CF, pyrexia, nasal congestion, oropharyngeal pain, productive 
cough, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. Overall, the AEs were mostly consistent with 
common manifestations of CF disease. The AEs that occurred more frequently (≥ 5 percentage points) in 
the LUM/IVA group versus the placebo group were productive cough (11.6 percentage points higher), 
sputum increased (8.7 percentage points higher), nasal congestion (8.6 percentage points higher), and 
upper abdominal pain (5.7 percentage points higher). The incidence of pyrexia was 5.2 percentage points 
higher in the placebo group than the LUM/IVA group. 
Studies 011B and 110: During the Cumulative Study Period, the most common AEs (incidence of ≥ 20%) 
were cough (60.3%), infective PEx of CF (39.7%), nasal congestion (36.2%), headache (25.9%), pyrexia 
(24.1%), abdominal pain upper (22.4%), and rhinorrhoea (20.7%). The exposure-adjusted numbers of 
AEs were generally similar or lower in the Study 110 Period than during the initial 24 weeks of treatment 
in Study 011B. 
Adverse events over time 
Study 109: A total of 176 (86.3%) subjects had onset of their first AE within the first 8 weeks of 
treatment. The incidence of AEs was highest in the first 8 weeks, and subsequently decreased; a similar 
trend was noted in both the placebo and LUM/IVA groups. 
Studies 011B and 110: In Study 011B, the incidence of AEs was highest in the first 8 weeks, and 
subsequently decreased. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study 109: A total of 24 (11.8%) subjects had at least 1 serious adverse event (SAE). The percentage of 
subjects with any SAEs was similar in the LUM/IVA (12.6%) and placebo (10.9%) groups. The only SAE 
that occurred in >2 (1.0%) subjects overall by PT was infective PEx of CF, a common manifestation of CF 
disease, which occurred in 8 (7.8%) subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 5 (5.0%) subjects in the placebo 
group.

Page 50/74 
  
  
Studies 011B and 110: During the Cumulative Study Period, the overall percentage of subjects with at 
least 1 SAE was 17.2%. By PT, the most common SAE was infective PEx of CF, which occurred in 7 
(12.1%) subjects. All other SAEs occurred in 1 subject each. 
The overall exposure-adjusted numbers of SAEs were similar in the Study 110 and Study 011B periods. 
The majority of SAEs by PT occurred in only 1 subject, without any trend or pattern. There were no 
deaths.  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Before database lock, AESIs were identified to evaluate specific events of interest by grouping AE terms 
that represent similar medical concepts, from the same or different SOC. The AESIs were defined as AEs 
related to elevated transaminases, respiratory symptoms, and respiratory events. In the initial marketing 
application for use of Orkambi in patients 12 years of age and older, the same AESIs were identified and 
analysed.  
Respiratory system – respiratory symptoms or reactive airways 
AESIs were created for 3 specific respiratory symptoms (PTs: chest discomfort, dyspnoea, and respiration 
abnormal) and a larger grouping of respiratory events, the latter of which includes the 3 specific 
respiratory symptoms events and 4 reactive airway events (PTs: asthma, bronchial hyper-reactivity, 
bronchospasm, and wheezing). 
Study 109: A total of 32 (15.7%) subjects had AESIs of respiratory events. The percentage of subjects 
with AESIs of respiratory events was 18.4% in the LUM/IVA group versus 12.9% in the placebo group. 
Twenty (9.8%) subjects overall had AESIs of respiratory symptoms. By PT, chest discomfort occurred in 1 
(0.5%) subject, dyspnoea occurred in 10 (4.9%) subjects, and respiration abnormal occurred in 10 (4.9%) 
subjects. For each PT, the incidence was similar in the LUM/IVA and placebo groups. Other respiratory 
events of asthma occurred in 4 (3.9%) subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 1 (1.0%) subject in the placebo 
group, and wheezing occurred in 5 (4.9%) subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 3 (3.0%) subjects in the 
placebo group. All AESIs of respiratory events were mild (25 of 32 subjects) or moderate (7 of 32 
subjects) in severity. One (1.0%) subject in the LUM/IVA group had AESIs of respiratory events (PT: 
respiration abnormal) that led to interruption and discontinuation of treatment. No subject had a serious 
AESI of respiratory events. 
Among the 32 subjects with AESIs of respiratory events, the median (range) time-to-onset of the first 
AESI was 17.0 (1 to 144) days in the LUM/IVA group and 10.0 (1 to 159) days in the placebo group. The 
median (range) event duration was 8.5 (1 to 169) days in the LUM/IVA group and 3.0 (1 to 45) days in 
the placebo group. 
Subgroup Analysis: Subjects with a ppFEV1 of <90 at baseline had incidences of 21.2% (LUM/IVA group) 
and 12.5% (placebo group) for AESIs of respiratory events. Subjects with a ppFEV1 of ≥ 90 at baseline 
had incidences of 16.0% (LUM/IVA group) and 13.2% (placebo group) for AESIs of respiratory events. 
Studies 011B and 110: During the Cumulative Study Period, the percentage of subjects with AESIs of 
respiratory events was 12.1% overall, 6.9% for wheezing, 3.4% for dyspnea and respiration abnormal, 
and 1.7% for bronchial hyperreactivity. All events were mild or moderate in severity. None were severe, 
life-threatening, led to death, or led to LUM/IVA treatment discontinuation or interruption.

Across PTs and descriptive categories (e.g., SAEs), the exposure-adjusted numbers of events were either 
lower or similar in the Study 110 Period than in the initial 24 weeks of treatment in Study 011B. 
The median (range) time-to-onset of first AESI of respiratory events was 100 (1 to 242) days. The median 
(range) event duration was 2 (1 to 29) days. 
Subgroup Analysis: During the Cumulative Study Period, subjects with a ppFEV1 of <90 percentage points 
at baseline had an incidence of 11.1% for AESIs of respiratory events and subjects with a ppFEV1 of ≥ 90 
percentage points at baseline had a similar incidence of 13.3%. 
Spirometry: Serial spirometry assessments on Day 1, Day 15, Week 16, and Week 24 were obtained for a 
subset of subjects with the objective of evaluating post-dose FEV1 because of the transient decline in 
ppFEV1 that has been observed with LUM/IVA treatment in older patients.  
On Day 1, the mean (range) absolute change in ppFEV1  4 to 6 hours after the first dose was -7.7 (-24.0, 
12.8) percentage points in the LUM/IVA group and -1.4 (-33.9, 17.5) percentage points in the placebo 
group. The number and percentage of subjects with AESIs of respiratory events on Day 1 was 3 (2.9%) 
subjects in the LUM/IVA group versus 4 (4.0%) subjects in the placebo group. On Day 15, the mean 
(range) absolute change in ppFEV1  4 to 6 hours after dosing was -1.3 (-25.2, 17.8) percentage points in 
the LUM/IVA group and 0.1 (-19.8, 17.2) percentage points in the placebo group, demonstrating a marked 
attenuation in the post-dose decline in ppFEV1 . This post-dose decline resolved at Week 16, with a mean 
(range) absolute change in ppFEV1  4 to 6 hours after dosing of 0.5 (-16.2, 22.1) percentage points in the 
LUM/IVA group and 0.6 (-25.9, 11.3) percentage points in the placebo group. The observed post-dose 
decline in mean ppFEV1  for the LUM/IVA group at 4 to 6 hours after dosing at Week 24 (absolute mean 
change [range] = -2.8 [-11.7, 10.0] percentage points in the LUM/IVA group and 0.1 [-7.8, 8.0] 
percentage points in the placebo group) most likely represents variability in the data rather than a 
clinically meaningful effect given the relatively small sample size. Overall, the serial spirometry data 
demonstrated a short-term, post-dose decline in ppFEV1 that was generally asymptomatic with relatively 
few respiratory AEs observed on Day 1, and was markedly attenuated by Day 15 and resolved by Week 
16. 
A total of 5 (4.9%) subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 5 (5.0%) subjects in the placebo group had AEs of 
FEV1 decreased, and 2 (1.9%) subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 3 (3.0%) subjects in the placebo group 
had AEs of pulmonary function test decreased. These AEs were mild to moderate in severity and none 
were considered serious or required interruption or discontinuation of study drug treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
Study 109: AESIs of elevated transaminases occurred in 20 (9.8%) subjects. The percentage of subjects 
with AESIs of elevated transaminases was similar in the LUM/IVA (9.7%) and placebo (9.9%) groups. By 
PT, ALT increased occurred in 17 (8.3%) subjects, AST increased occurred in 13 (6.4%) subjects, and 
transaminases increased occurred in 3 (1.5%) subjects. The percentage of subjects was similar in the 
LUM/IVA and placebo groups for each PT. The majority of AESIs of elevated transaminases were mild (8 of 
20 subjects) or moderate (9 of 20 subjects) in severity. One subject in the LUM/IVA group and 2 subjects 
in the placebo group had AESIs of elevated transaminases that were severe. No life-threatening AESIs of 
elevated transaminases occurred. Three (1.5%) subjects, all of whom were in the LUM/IVA group, had 
AESIs of elevated transaminases that led to treatment interruption. Four (2.0%) subjects (2 subjects in 
the LUM/IVA group and 2 subjects in the placebo group) discontinued treatment due to an AESI of

elevated transaminases; with 1 exception, the events were mild to moderate in severity and all were 
considered possibly related to study drug and resolved. Two (1.0%) subjects, both of whom were in the 
placebo group, had serious AESIs of elevated transaminases; the events were moderate to severe in 
severity, considered possibly related to study drug, and resolved. Among the 20 subjects with AESIs of 
elevated transaminases, the median (range) time-to-onset of the first AESI was 85.0 (22 to 150) days in 
the LUM/IVA group and 59.0 (16 to 169) days in the placebo group. The median (range) event duration 
was 14.0 (3 to 65) days in the LUM/IVA group and 20.0 (8 to 92) days in the placebo group. 
Studies 011B and 110: During the Cumulative Study Period, the percentage of subjects with elevated 
transaminase AESIs was 15.5% overall, 15.5% for ALT increased, and 8.6% for AST increased. None of 
the events were severe, life-threatening, or led to death. One (1.7%) subject had an event that led to 
treatment discontinuation; this occurred during the initial 24 weeks of treatment in Study 011B. Four 
(6.9%) subjects had an event that led to treatment interruption; for 3 subjects, this occurred during the 
initial 24 weeks of treatment in Study 011B. One (1.7%) subject had an event that was considered an 
SAE; this occurred during the initial 24 weeks of treatment in Study 011B. Across PTs and descriptive 
categories (e.g., SAEs), the exposure-adjusted numbers of events were lower in the Study 110 Period 
than in the initial 24 weeks of treatment in Study 011B. The median (range) time-to-onset of first AESI of 
elevated transaminases was 85 (10 to 225) days. The median (range) event duration was 25.5 (7 to 282) 
days. 
Safety in special populations 
The AEs were summarized by subgroups of ppFEV1 severity, weight, sex, geographic region, and prior use 
of inhaled antibiotics or bronchodilators for Study 109 and by ppFEV1 severity, sex, and age for Study 
011B. Some numerical differences were observed; however, there were no trends that suggested a 
different safety profile in any of the subgroups. In Study 110, subgroup analyses based on ppFEV1 at 
baseline were performed for the respiratory AESIs only. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No additional interactions are expected in this subpopulation in comparison with the currently identified 
ones.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 5 (2.5%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. The incidence was similar in 
both groups: 3 (2.9%) subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 2 (2.0%) subjects in the placebo group. By PT, 
ALT increased, AST increased, and transaminases increased each occurred in 1 (1.0%) subject in the 
LUM/IVA group and 1 (1.0%) subject in the placebo group, and respiration abnormal occurred in 1 (1.0%) 
subject in the LUM/IVA group. A total of 12 (5.9%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption; 9 
(8.7%) subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 3 (3.0%) subjects in the placebo group. By PT, ALT increased, 
AST increased, and rash occurred in 2 (1.9%) subjects each in the LUM/IVA group. All other AEs that led 
to treatment interruption occurred in 1 subject each.

Post marketing experience 
LUM/IVA (Orkambi, 200-mg/125-mg tablets) was first approved in the US on 02 July 2015, followed by EU 
Marketing Authorisation granted on 19 November 2015 via the centralised procedure. Additionally, 
Orkambi is approved for marketing in Canada, Australia, Switzerland, and Israel. LUM/IVA (100-mg/125-
mg tablets) was approved in the US for patients 6 to 11 years of age on 28 September 2016. 
Since the initial approval, it is estimated that 9838 patients (representing 6008-years) have been treated 
with commercial LUM/IVA cumulatively up to the data lock point (19 November 2016) of the second 
periodic safety update report (PSUR 2). The post-marketing safety data are summarized in the 2 
completed PSURs. PSUR 2 was submitted on 27 January 2017 and is currently under assessment. The 
benefit-risk profile of LUM/IVA treatment remains favourable. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Data from the 24-week, placebo-controlled study 109 and uncontrolled study 011B showed that 
administration of LUM/IVA was overall safe and well tolerated for up to 24 weeks in subjects 6 through 11 
years of age. The common AEs observed were mostly manifestations of CF disease. No new safety 
concerns were identified compared with subjects aged 12 years and older. 
A total of 32 (15.7%) subjects had AESIs of respiratory events in Study 109, all of which were mild or 
moderate in severity. The percentage of subjects with AESIs of respiratory events was 18.4% in the 
LUM/IVA group versus 12.9% in the placebo group; these percentages are lower than what was observed 
in subjects 12 years of age and older (Studies 103 and 104, in which 26.3% of subjects on active 
treatment had AESIs of respiratory events), suggesting a better respiratory tolerability in young patients 
with more preserved lung function. Only 1 (1.0%) subject in the LUM/IVA group had AESIs of respiratory 
events that led to interruption and discontinuation of treatment. 
Serial spirometry assessments on Day 1, Day 15, Week 16, and Week 24 of Study 109 were obtained for a 
subset of subjects with the objective of evaluating postdose FEV1 due to concerns raised over observations 
of initial transient decline in FEV1 on initiation of treatment in older patients, with the added concern that 
this may be greater in younger children with smaller diameter airways. Serial spirometry data 
demonstrated a transient decline (at 4 – 6 hours post-dose) in ppFEV1 that was generally asymptomatic. 
Although the mean decline of -7.7 in LUM/IVA patients could be considered potentially clinically significant 
whereas the mean decline was  -1.4 in placebo patients, there was also extremely wide variability (95% CI 
-24.8, 12.8 in LUM/IVA versus -33.9, 17.5 in placebo). Therefore, some placebo treated patients 
apparently declined more than LUM/IVA patients and the variability may in part reflect the greater 
unreliability of spirometry measurements that require voluntary effort in young children. Respiratory AESI 
on Day 1 were 2.9% in LUM/IVA and 4.0% in the placebo group consistent with the asymptomatic nature 
of the decline. Thus, the decline in FEV1 does not appear to be associated with respiratory adverse events 
at the time. The decline was markedly attenuated by Day 15 and resolved by Week 16. There was also an 
overall low rate of treatment discontinuation in studies 011 and 109 that was similar in LUM/IVA and 
placebo groups which supports that the observation of decline in ppFEV1, is not of major concern.  
Literature data provide external evidence of a transient, post-dose decline in FEV1, the mechanism being 
unknown. Data support that the effect is similar in the 6 -11 years age group compared to older patients. 
More than 80% of patients in the Orkambi studies were already using bronchodilators at study entry which 
is reflective of use in the CF population at large. Subgroup analysis (subjects with or without 
Assessment report  
EMA/781319/2017 
Page 54/74 
  
  
bronchodilator use) did not demonstrate any trend suggesting a lower rate of respiratory events in 
subjects with bronchodilator use. Published studies have examined bronchodilator use as risk minimisation 
upon initiation of LUM/IVA, with mixed success. Overall therefore there does appear to be insufficient 
evidence to support additional bronchodilator use or other risk minimisation strategy to cover the initiation 
of treatment with Orkambi. Furthermore, most patients will have been prescribed bronchodilators. The 
SmPC has been updated with the information on the temporary FEV1 decline at the start of the treatment 
with Orkambi.  
In the uncontrolled study 011B and in study 109, ALT and AST elevations appeared to be higher than that 
observed in subjects 12 years of age and older (studies 103 and 104). These observations are consistent 
with information available in the published literature that indicates transaminase elevations are more 
common in younger patients with CF than in adults, and are also consistent with a background rate of 
15.3% (ALT/AST >3 × ULN) in placebo-treated subjects of the same age group from a previously 
completed 24-week IVA monotherapy study (Study VX08-770-103 Part B). In study 109 (24 week 
placebo-controlled study in 204 patients 6 – 11 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or 
AST) levels >8, >5, and >3 x ULN was 1.0%, 4.9% and 12.6% respectively in the LUM/IVA treated 
patients and 2.0%, 3.0% and 7.9% in the placebo treated patients. This illustrates that transaminase 
elevation is a feature of the disease. No patients had total bilirubin levels > 2 x ULN.  There were ~5% 
more patients with modestly elevated (>3 x ULN) transaminases in the LUM/IVA group. No difference was 
observed for ALT/AST >5 and 8 × ULN, as well as discontinuations, between the LUM/IVA and placebo 
groups, and the only SAEs occurred in 2 subjects in the placebo group. 
The Cumulative Study Period, which included the Study 011B and Study110 periods, covered 
approximately 60 weeks of LUM/IVA exposure in 49 subjects. As would be expected, cumulative incidence 
rates (15.5% overall), of transaminase elevation were higher than in the shorter duration studies. No 
events of transaminase elevation were severe. The cumulative study period was an uncontrolled, open 
label study period in which the contribution from longer disease duration versus longer drug exposure 
cannot be distinguished.  However, the published literature also indicates that transaminase elevation is 
more common in younger patients with CF than in adults.  
There were no cases of possible drug-related liver toxicity sufficient to satisfy Hy’s law.  An association 
between Orkambi and drug induced liver injury cannot be excluded, however, as stated in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC. Because of this, section 4.4 includes the recommendation that liver function should be assessed 
prior to initiation of Orkambi, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter, 
with more frequent monitoring in patients with a history of elevations in ALT, AST or bilirubin. In the event 
of significant elevation of ALT or AST, with or without elevated bilirubin (either ALT or AST >5 x the upper 
limit of normal [ULN], or ALT or AST >3 x ULN with bilirubin >2 x ULN), dosing with lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
should be discontinued and laboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following 
resolution of transaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of resuming dosing should be considered.  
Although transaminases are generally higher in younger patients with CF, for reasons that are unclear, 
there is no evidence that Orkambi poses a higher risk of serious drug-related toxicity in the 6 – 11 year 
old age group, provided they are administered with the age-appropriate formulation. Following 
administration of the respective age appropriate formulations for 6 – 11 year old and 12 years and older 
patients, LUM and IVA exposures in most 6 – 11 year old patients lie within the 5th and 95th percentiles of 
exposures in the older patients.  The current warnings in section 4.4 of the SmPC are therefore considered 
adequate for the line extension.

Safety data from Study 110 showed that administration of LUM/IVA was overall well tolerated in subjects 6 
years of age and older for up to 60 weeks (24 weeks in Study 011B and 36 weeks in Study 110) without 
new safety concerns. 
Blood Pressure data across Studies 109, 011B, and 110 showed that BP levels were variable but generally 
consistent with previous observations from the LUM/IVA-treated subjects 12 years of age and older 
(Studies 103 and 104). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the findings from Study 109, as well as Studies 011B and 110, support the use of LUM/IVA in 
subjects 6 through 11 years of age with CF, homozygous for F508del. The safety outcomes were generally 
consistent with the background profile in patients with CF and the established safety profile of LUM/IVA. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 19 November 2017. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

Section 4.5 describes the potential for LUM/IVA to

and OAT3, and lumacaftor and ivacaftor are inhibitors 
of BCRP. Coadministration of Orkambi with medicinal

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Orkambi (lumacaftor / ivacaftor) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it is a medicinal product authorised in the EU that contains a new active 
substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU, 
and as it has an imposed PASS.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This line extension application is for an extension of indication to children 6 years and older, from the 
currently approved target population of cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older, homozygous for 
F508del-CFTR. Orkambi is authorised in the EU as a single strength LUM 200-mg/IVA 125-mg FDC tablet 
for oral administration, given as 2 tablets (administered dose LUM 400 mg/IVA 250 mg) every 12 hours. 
The line extension adds a lower strength FDC tablet, with a different ratio of LUM to IVA (LUM 100-mg/IVA 
125-mg) from the existing strength (LUM 200-mg/IVA 125-mg) to be administered as 2 tablets every 12 
hours in CF patients 6 to 11 years of age with the F508del CF mutation. The total daily administered dose 
of LUM is therefore half (400 mg) that of the daily dose in children 12 years and older (800 mg) whereas 
the daily dose of IVA is the same (500 mg) in both age groups. The aim of therapy is to modify the course 
of the disease due to correction/improvement in chloride channel function. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Lumacaftor (a CFTR corrector) has been developed in combination with ivacaftor (a CFTR potentiator) as a 
fixed dose combination tablet for oral administration in the treatment of CF patients homozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation. This genotype is present in ~40% of the CF population and  results in a severe  
form of the disease that requires the combined action of lumacaftor to correct processing and trafficking of 
the CFTR conductance channel, with the potentiator action of ivacaftor to enhance channel open 
probability. The FDC is currently authorised in the EU as Orkambi, for the 12 years and older population

only. Ivacaftor is authorised as Kalydeco as monotherapy treatment for CF in patients aged 6 years and 
older who have one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, 
G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R. Orkambi is currently authorised for CF 
patients 12 years and older homozygous for F508del-CFTR. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor target the 
biochemical defect in the chloride channel protein whereas all other current treatments for CF alleviate the 
clinical manifestations of the disease but do not act on the underlying chloride channel defect. Current 
treatments include inhaled mucolytics, bronchodilators, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, and 
pancreatic enzymes. 
The new dose combination of Orkambi submitted with the line extension will fulfil an unmet need in the 
extended target population 6 – 11 years. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal efficacy and safety study 109 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in CF patients 
aged 6 - 11 years, homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Subjects were 6 –  11 years old, males 
and females, confirmed to be homozygous for F508del-CFTR. Patients had evidence of uneven ventilation 
due to small airways disease at screening (LCI 2.5  ≥ 7.5) but could have normal spirometry (pp FEV1 
>70). This is characteristic of this patient population.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint in the pivotal trial was met in demonstrating a statistically significant treatment 
difference for LUM/IVA versus placebo, in favour of LUM/IVA, for the efficacy variable absolute change in 
LCI2.5 from baseline through week 24. There was a LS mean treatment difference of -1.09 (95% CI, -
1.43, -0.75) p<0.0001 for the absolute change through Week 24. Average absolute change in sweat 
chloride from baseline at Day 15 and at Week 4 was specified in the SAP as one of three key secondary 
efficacy endpoints. LUM/IVA resulted in improvement (i.e., a reduction) in sweat chloride at  Day 15 and 
sustained through Week 24, with a LS mean treatment difference of -20.8 mmol/L (95% CI -23.4, -18.2; 
P<0.0001) for the average absolute change at Day 15 and at Week 4. The reduction in sweat chloride is 
consistent with at least partial restoration of the biochemical defect and with the combined 
corrector/potentiator action of LUM/IVA. 
There was a numerical improvement in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through Week 24 with a treatment 
difference compared to placebo of 2.5 points. Analysis of ppFEV1 demonstrated a small overall increase 
from baseline in ppFEV1 by week 24 although there was variability at earlier times. MMRM analysis 
through week 24 demonstrated a nominal statistically significant difference for LUM/IVA versus placebo in 
study 109.   
In a small number of subjects in study 109 exploratory lung imaging was performed. There was evidence 
of reduced bronchiectasis, mucous plugging, peribronchial thickening, and hyperinflation based on CT and 
reduced bronchiectasis, mucous plugging, and peribronchial thickening based on UTE MRI. The numbers 
are too small to draw definitive conclusions but may reflect potential for improvement in baseline disease 
as well as slowing of disease progression. Exploratory pulmonary imaging will be continued as a substudy 
in the long term study 110 in 6 – 11 year olds. If beneficial effect on pulmonary architecture can be 
confirmed, this would support introduction of correction therapy at early stages of disease to provide pre-

emptive benefit. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The primary efficacy endpoint (absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 24) reveals LS 
mean treatment difference for active versus placebo -1.09 (95% CI, -1.43, -0.75). There are limited data 
from trials using this endpoint and a minimum clinically important difference has not yet been defined. 
Effect sizes in studies have ranged from -1 to -2 depending on the type of intervention and the duration of 
treatment (Amin 2010, Thorax; Amin 2011, Eur Respir J; Davies 2012, American Thoracic Society 
International Conference. San Francisco). Limited longitudinal data from the placebo group of 
interventional trials are available to define whether an intervention exceeds the intrinsic variability of the 
test. The report from the recent workshop on endpoints in clinical trials nonetheless considers this 
endpoint sufficiently established for trials in CF patients 6 – 11 years of age. 
The reduction in sweat chloride is consistent with at least partial restoration of the biochemical defect and 
with the combined corrector/potentiator action of LUM/IVA. Although the mean reduction of ~ 20 mmol/L 
was quite rapid and marked, the decline levelled off with no evidence of ongoing decline. The decline in 
mean sweat chloride to ~ 80 mmol/L is still substantially higher than normal range for sweat chloride (< 
30 mmol/L). The applicant provided references from natural history data to justify that improvement in 
CFTR function by 10-20%, in patients homozygous for F508del, would be expected to result in clinically 
meaningful benefit. It is clarified that no patients achieved normalisation of sweat chloride.  
MMRM analysis of change from baseline in ppFEV1 through week 24 in ppFEV1 overall demonstrated an 
improvement from baseline with LUM/IVA, with nominally significant benefit over placebo. However, there 
was variability at earlier times and in study 109, there was an early post-dose but transient and 
asymptomatic decline in ppFEV1. This is discussed further under unfavourable effects.   
Of the three key secondary efficacy endpoints, only one (sweat chloride) demonstrated a statistically 
significant nominal difference for LUM/IVA versus placebo and the clinical relevance of this magnitude of 
reduction is unclear. The other key secondary efficacy endpoints BMI and CFR-Q failed to demonstrate 
clear benefit over placebo. However, efficacy benefit reflective of more global clinical improvement is 
difficult to demonstrate over a short time period in a patient population with relatively mild disease at 
baseline.  
Although the absolute change from baseline BMI in subjects with a BMI z-score <0 was similar in  the 
LUM/IVA and placebo groups over 24 weeks of treatment,  responder analysis in subjects with a BMI z-
score <0 showed that the percentage  with a BMI value ≥ 50th percentile at Week 24 was higher in the 
LUM/IVA group (9 [14.8%] subjects) than in the placebo group (4 [7.7%] subjects). This supports that 
LUM/IVA has a positive effect on nutritional parameters in undernourished children. 
Study 011B arguably more clearly demonstrated clinically relevant change from baseline across secondary 
efficacy endpoints, but the patients had more impaired respiratory function at baseline and may as a 
population have been more sensitive to revelation of benefit over a relatively short time scale. Study 011B 
was uncontrolled but provides some support for clinical relevance of efficacy benefit.  The documented 
efficacy benefit for LUM/IVA in 12 years and older patients, albeit in a different posology, is also 
supportive.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The 24-week, placebo-controlled Study 109 and uncontrolled Study 011B showed that administration of 
LUM/IVA was overall safe and well tolerated for up to 24 weeks in subjects 6 through 11 years of age. The 
common AEs observed were mostly manifestations of CF disease. No new safety concerns were identified 
compared with subjects aged 12 years and older. The Cumulative Study Period, which included the Study 
011B and Study110 periods, covered approximately 60 weeks of LUM/IVA exposure in 49 subjects 6 – 11 
years old. 18.4% of patients in the LUM/IVA group in study 109 had respiratory adverse events compared 
with 12.9% in the placebo group; however these percentages are lower than in older patients in studies 
103 and 104 where 26.3% of patients on active treatment had respiratory adverse events.  
Serial spirometry data demonstrated a transient decline (at 4 – 6 hours post-dose) in ppFEV1 that was 
generally asymptomatic. The mean decline of -7.7 in LUM/IVA patients could be considered potentially 
clinically significant; the mean decline was -1.4 in placebo patients. The SmPC include adequate 
information on these events to inform the treating physicians. 
Patients with CF are prone to biliary cirrhosis due to thickened biliary secretions and therefore hepatic 
transaminase elevation is a common occurrence in the disease.  Elevated transaminases have been 
reported in patients with CF receiving lumacaftor/ivacaftor. In some instances, these elevations have been 
associated with concomitant elevations in total serum bilirubin. In the uncontrolled Study 011B and in 
Study 109, ALT and AST elevations appeared to be higher than that observed in subjects 12 years of age 
and older (Studies 103 and 104). These observations are consistent with information available in the 
published literature that indicates transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients with CF 
than in adults, and are also consistent with a background rate of 15.3% (ALT/AST >3 × ULN) in placebo-
treated subjects of the same age group from a previously completed 24-week IVA monotherapy study 
(Study VX08-770-103 Part B).  
In study 109 there were ~5% more patients with modestly elevated (>3 x ULN) transaminases in the 
LUM/IVA group. No difference was observed for ALT/AST >5 and 8 × ULN, as well as discontinuations, 
between the LUM/IVA and placebo groups, and the only SAEs occurred in 2 subjects in the placebo group. 
In the Cumulative Study Period, which included the Study 011B and Study110 periods, covered 
approximately 60 weeks of LUM/IVA exposure in 49 subjects. As would be expected, cumulative incidence 
rates (15.5% overall), of transaminase elevation were higher than in the shorter duration studies. No 
events of transaminase elevation were severe. The cumulative study period was an uncontrolled, open 
label study period in which the contribution from longer disease duration versus longer drug exposure 
cannot be distinguished.  
There were no cases of possible drug-related liver toxicity sufficient to satisfy Hy’s law.  An association 
between Orkambi and drug induced liver injury cannot be excluded. Because of this, section 4.4 in SmPC 
includes recommendations for liver function test monitoring at initiation and periodically during treatment, 
with recommendations to discontinue or interrupt treatment in the presence of abnormal liver function. 
The current recommendations for the 12 years and older population are considered sufficient for the 6-11 
year old patients.  
Blood Pressure data across Studies 109, 011B, and 110 showed that BP levels were variable but generally 
consistent with previous observations from the LUM/IVA-treated subjects 12 years of age and older 
(Studies 103 and 104). 
The RMP specifies appropriate safety concerns.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Transient decline in ppFEV1has been observed in older patients and there was some uncertainty whether 
the risk may be greater in younger patients with smaller diameter airways. Serial spirometry assessments 
to evaluate pre- and post-dose ppFEV1 were obtained for a subset of subjects in the 6 – 11 year age 
group at Day 1, Day 15, Week 16, and Week 24 of Study 109. Although the mean decline in  ppFEV1 at 4-
6 hours post-dose on Day 1 in study 109 appeared to be steep (-7.7 percentage points) compared to 
placebo (-1.4%) , there was also very wide variability with wide confidence intervals (95% CI -24.8, 12.8 
in LUM/IVA versus -33.9, 17.5 in placebo). Therefore, some placebo treated patients apparently declined 
more than LUM/IVA patients and the variability may in part reflect the greater unreliability of spirometry 
measurements that require voluntary effort in young children. Respiratory AESI on Day 1 were 2.9% in 
LUM/IVA and 4.0% in the placebo group consistent with the asymptomatic nature of the decline. 
Therefore, the decline in FEV1 does not appear to be associated with respiratory adverse events at the 
time. The post-dose decline was markedly attenuated by Day 15 and resolved by Week 16. There was also 
an overall low rate of treatment discontinuation in studies 011 and 109 that was similar in LUM/IVA and 
placebo groups. 
Literature data provide external evidence of a transient, post-dose decline in FEV1, the mechanism being 
unknown. Data support that the effect is similar in the 6 -11 years age group compared to older patients. 
More than 80% of patients in the Orkambi studies were already using bronchodilators at study entry which 
is reflective of use in the CF population at large. Subgroup analysis (subjects with or without 
bronchodilator use) did not demonstrate any trend suggesting a lower rate of respiratory events in 
subjects with bronchodilator use. Published studies have examined bronchodilator use as risk minimisation 
upon initiation of LUM/IVA, with mixed success. Overall therefore there does appear to be insufficient 
evidence to support additional bronchodilator use or other risk minimisation strategy to cover the initiation 
of treatment with Orkambi. Furthermore, most patients will have been prescribed bronchodilators. The 
CHMP expressed concerns in regard to the early decline in ppFEV1, particularly in relation to adequacy of 
the explanations given for missing spirometric data and whether missing data has led to distortion of 
ppFEV1 values at later times. As explained by the MAH, a major reason for the large amount of missing 
spirometric data appears to have been due to the instigation of a different protocol to comply with a 
modified PIP, mid-way through the study. In Protocol v1.0: There were 117 subjects who received study 
drug and per protocol were to have serial postdose spirometry measurements conducted at Day 1 and Day 
15. Spirometry was performed pre-bronchodilator and predose, and 2 and 4 hours postdose. Protocol 
v2.0: There were 87 subjects who received study drug and per protocol were to have serial postdose 
spirometry measurements conducted at Day 1, Day 15, Week 16, and Week 24. On Day 1, spirometry was 
performed pre-bronchodilator and predose, and at 0.25 to 1 hour, 4 to 6 hours, and 24 hours postdose. 
On Day 15, Week 16, and Week 24, spirometry was performed pre-bronchodilator and predose, and at 
0.25 to 1 hour and 4 to 6 hours postdose. 
There were consequently more subjects with postdose spirometry measurements at Day 1 and Day 15 
compared to Week 16 and Week 24 because per protocol there were 117 fewer subjects required to have 
the postdose spirometry assessments at Week 16 and Week 24. 
Of  subjects who had a ppFEV1 decline ≥ 5 percentage points at 4 to 6 hours postdose on Day 1, 53 did 
not have postdose spirometry at Week 24. Thirty-nine (74%) of these subjects were initially screened 
under Protocol v1.0 and thus were not required to have postdose spirometry at Week 24 per protocol. The 
missing spirometry assessments for the remaining 14 subjects are due to a combination of treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/781319/2017 
Page 68/74 
  
  
discontinuation, treatment interruption, pharmacy issue, and dosing error (dosed with Study 110 study 
drug at Week 24). 
Another reason for missed spirometric measurements was due to a change in the scheduling of treatment 
in relation to the week 24 visit as a result of the protocol amendment. The Day 1 Visit of Study 110 was 
on the same day as the Week 24 Visit (last Treatment Period visit) of Study 109. Per protocol, subjects 
who initially screened under Protocol v1.0 were to have the last Study 109 dose the evening before the 
Week 24 Visit, whereas subjects who initially screened under Protocol v2.0 were to have the last Study 
109 dose at the Week 24 Visit (this was done to account for the added postdose spirometry assessments 
at the Week 24 Visit in Protocol v2.0). Sites were provided with additional training due to the identification 
of a trend where subjects who initially screened under Protocol v2.0 were inadvertently dosed with Study 
110 study drug at Week 24. To minimize any misinterpretation of postdose spirometry data at the Week 
24 Visit (placebo and LUM/IVA treatment), postdose spirometry measurements for these subjects were 
considered invalid and were not included in the spirometry analysis for Study 109. The dosing errors 
appear can therefore be understood as arising largely from the protocol change rather than from 
fundamental flaws in study integrity.  
Analyses examining the postdose ppFEV1 results for subjects who completed all serial spirometry 
assessments and for subjects who did not complete all serial spirometry assessments support the 
conclusion that the missing spirometry data do not impact the interpretation of the serial lung function 
measurements. 
Although the phenomenon of decline in ppFEV1was associated at the time with no respiratory adverse 
events in this population of patients with stable CF at baseline, the possible implications for patients with 
co-existent airways hypersensitivity, or for those with unstable CF at the time of treatment initiation, were 
considered, in case patients predisposed to airways narrowing may require bronchodilator therapy to cover 
the early period after treatment initiation.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
It is considered that clinical efficacy has been sufficiently demonstrated in CF patients homozygous for 
F509del-CFTR aged 6 – 11 years administered with the new FDC combination of Orkambi at the proposed 
posology. Administration of LUM/IVA was overall safe and well tolerated for up to 24 weeks in subjects 6 
through 11 years of age. The common AEs observed were mostly manifestations of CF disease. No new 
safety concerns were identified compared with subjects aged 12 years and older. 
Although there are still limited patient numbers in the 6 -11 yrs age range treated for 12 months or more, 
in the context of this as a rare disease with high unmet need, the safety data are considered in principle 
sufficient to support long term administration of the new FDC in patients 6-11 years of age. Safety 
information can also be drawn from the extensive post-marketing experience of Orkambi. An imposed 
PASS to evaluate use, safety  and long term effects of lumacaftor/ ivacaftor therapy in patients aged 6 to 
11 years (as part of Study 108) is a condition of the marketing authorisation. There is a clear unmet need 
in this patient population and the benefits are considered to outweigh the risks. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Patients homozygous for F508del-CFTR have a severe form of cystic fibrosis. Orkambi provides a 
Assessment report

combination of lumacaftor to correct processing and trafficking of the CFTR conductance channel, with the 
potentiator action of ivacaftor to enhance channel open probability. Orkambi is currently authorised in the 
EU for the 12 years and older population. The biochemical defect in the CFTR conductance channel is 
present from birth and although the disease can take many years to become manifested in full, there is 
evidence of respiratory and other organ involvement in patients 6 – 11 years even if there is no overt 
pulmonary dysfunction as measured by spirometry. The aim of the Orkambi line extension was to provide 
a suitable age-appropriate formulation to treat a younger group of patients (6-11 years), the goal being to 
modify the disease course by correction or at least improvement in the biochemical defect at a stage of 
disease where slowing of disease, or possibly pre-emption of respiratory and other consequences of the 
disease, may be possible.  
The line extension is for a new combination of Orkambi with an altered ratio of LUM/IVA that was 
confirmed by PK modelling for LUM and IVA exposure in the 6 – 11 year old population and is supported 
by new PK data and a Population PK analysis supplied with the dossier. The data overall support an age 
cut-off of 11 years with patients moving on to the already authorised combination from the age of 12. The 
evidence presented is considered to provide sufficient evidence of clinically relevant efficacy benefit in a 
marker of ventilation inhomogeneity that is consistent with improvement in small airways disease. This is 
supported by improvement in sweat chloride, consistent with at least partial correction of the defect in the 
chloride channel protein and a trend to improvement in other efficacy endpoints at a stage of disease 
where decline in respiratory function is likely to be slow.  
An early post-dose, transient, decline in ppFEV1 occurs after initiation of LUM/IVA which is unexplained 
but does not appear to impede the overall benefit on ventilation homogeneity and spirometry over the 
longer term. A warning in section 4.4 has been implemented, to avoid misinterpretation of this as lack of 
efficacy, risking discontinuation.  
As observed in studies in older patients, there are modest elevations in transaminases but no evidence 
that the younger patients are at higher risk. The risk minimisation for the 12 years and older population is 
considered to be adequate for the younger patients. More generally, the risk minimisation in place for the 
12 years and older patients is considered in principle to be adequate for the 6 – 11 year old population, 
unless additional measures may be required in the early period after treatment initiation to mitigate the 
risk of decline in ppFEV1 in susceptible patients. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Orkambi (age-appropriate formulation) in CF patients 6 – 11 years homozygous for 
F508del-CFTR is positive and the line extension is approvable.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Orkambi is not similar to Bronchitol, Cayston, TOBI Podhaler 
and Kalydeco within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 
1.

Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of, Orkambi film-coated tablets (100 mg Lumacaftor / 125 mg Ivacaftor) is 
favourable in the following indication: 
Orkambi is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Orkambi subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

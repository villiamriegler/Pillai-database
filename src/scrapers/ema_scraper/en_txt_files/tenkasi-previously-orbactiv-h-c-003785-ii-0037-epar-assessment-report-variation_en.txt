Tenkasi 400 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is currently approved for treatment of 
acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults. 
Epidemiology 
ABSSSI are among the most common human bacterial infections and include cellulitis, erysipelas, 
wound infections (traumatic or post-surgical) and major abscesses. Cellulitis and abscesses are 
commonly encountered in the community setting and frequently result in hospitalisation. ABSSSI such 
as surgical site infections and burn infections are also seen in the hospital setting. Both erysipelas and 
cellulitis are characterised by rapidly spreading areas of oedema, redness, and heat, sometimes 
accompanied by lymphangitis and enlargement of the regional lymph nodes. ABSSSI are a common 
indication for antibiotic use in Europe and are associated with considerable morbidity. Data from the 
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimated that 4% of all healthcare-
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 7/50 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
acquired infections (HAI) reported between 2011 and 2012 were ABSSSI, with surgical-site infections 
being the second most frequently reported HAI (19.6%) (ECDC, Surveillance report 2011–2012).  
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The most common bacteria identified in ABSSSI are Gram-positive pathogens, including streptococci 
and staphylococci. In Europe, the most frequently isolated Gram-positive ABSSSI pathogen is S. 
aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)), 
followed by β-haemolytic streptococci. The prevalence of MRSA has increased worldwide in both 
healthcare- and community-based settings. In Europe, the prevalence of MRSA varies greatly across 
countries, with much higher frequencies seen in southern and south-eastern countries. Based on the 
European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net), the European population-
weighted mean percentage for MRSA was 15.5% in 2019, ranging from 1.1% in Norway to 46.7% in 
Romania (ECDC, Surveillance Report: Antimicrobial resistance in EU/EEA (EARS-Net), 2020).  
In patients with comorbidities and those previously treated with antibiotics, ABSSSI can often be 
polymicrobial, with Gram-negative and obligate anaerobic pathogens found together with Gram-
positive organisms. Gram-negative aetiology is common in surgical-site infections setting as reported 
in the SENTRY programme (1998 – 2004), with P. aeruginosa being the second most important 
pathogen after MRSA, followed by E. coli.  
Drug-resistant bacteria are playing an increasing role as causative pathogens in ABSSSI. P. 
aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. can play an important 
role in polymicrobial long-standing infections such as diabetic foot infection and decubiti but are also 
increasingly recognised in monomicrobial ABSSSI. The presence of MRSA in surgical site infections is 
independently associated with mortality compared with patients with MSSA.  
Management 
Management of ABSSSI is dependent on the clinical presentation and the severity of the infection. 
Initial treatment of ABSSSI is usually empirical because culture results are not immediately available, 
and patients with ABSSSI benefit from rapid initiation of appropriate therapy (Clinical guideline 
(CG74), NICE 2014). Most streptococci remain susceptible to penicillin and β-lactam antibiotics, 
providing many treatment options for adults when culture results are known. Infections due to MRSA 
are more complex in terms of management in hospital because of the additional steps that must be 
implemented for their treatment (e.g., decolonisation, protective clothing for nurses, isolation units, 
more expensive antibiotics, frequent laboratory tests, or blood cultures).  
When MRSA is identified as a single pathogen, several treatment options are available in Europe, 
including vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, tedizolid, oritavancin, dalbavancin, and 
ceftaroline. Agents like vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin have been available for some time. 
However, these older agents, along with many of the drugs more recently approved for ABSSSI, 
provide only Gram-positive coverage. Linezolid is one of the most used agents for an empirical starting 
of the treatment due to its activity against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive organisms. 
Ceftaroline and tigecycline are active against Gram-negative organisms but are only available in an IV 
formulation. Cephalosporins, carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem), and ureido-penicillins (such as 
piperacillin), aminoglycosides, or quinolone antibacterials can be used to provide Gram-negative 
coverage in these situations, as well. In cases where MRSA and Gram-negative organisms are isolated, 
these agents can be added to MRSA active agents.

Products specifically licensed for paediatric patients (varying age ranges) within the EU include 
tedizolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, tigecycline, ceftaroline, and daptomycin. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
The active substance of Tenkasi 400 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is oritavancin. 
Oritavancin is a semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide antibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria. Its 
antibacterial activity is based on three principal mechanisms of action: 1) inhibition of the 
transglycosylation (polymerisation) step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the stem peptide of 
peptidoglycan precursors; 2) inhibition of the transpeptidation (crosslinking) step of cell wall 
biosynthesis by binding to the peptide bridging segments of the cell wall; and 3) disruption of bacterial 
membrane integrity, leading to depolarisation, permeabilisation, and rapid cell death. Oritavancin 
exhibits rapid, extensive tissue distribution and a long terminal half-life (245 hours) and is not 
metabolised. 
Oritavancin was approved in the EU on 18th March 2015 (EMEA/H/C/003785) for the treatment of 
acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults and the recommended dose is a 
single 1200 mg intravenous (IV) infusion over 3 hours. In adults, no dose adjustment is needed in 
patients with mild/moderate renal or hepatic impairment. 
This application concerns the extension of indication to the paediatric population aged 3 months to less 
than 18 years based on the interim report of study TMC-ORI-11-01. The proposed dose is 15 mg/kg as 
a single dose infused over 3 hours. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Study TMC-ORI-11-01 is part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for oritavancin (EMEA-001270-
PIP01-12; see table below). Study 3 is ongoing and planned to be completed by July 2023. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 9/50 
 
 
 
  
 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH has provided a statement that study TMC-ORI-11-01 was conducted in accordance with the 
ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice, according to the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline. The 
study was conducted at 8 sites in the US. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Summary of the ERA 
Subject of the extension is the inclusion of paediatric patients 3 months and older in the SmPC. 
The maximum daily dose and the predicted environmental concentration remain unchanged compared 
with the initial environmental risk assessment. 
The MAH is of the opinion that the ERA performed for the previous application will be still valid for the 
current variation. Therefore, no new ERA data have been provided by the MAH. 
CHMP agreed that the present application for extension to include paediatric patients from 3 months of 
age in the SmPC without changing the maximum recommended daily dose of 1200 mg will not lead to 
an increased predicted environmental concentration compared to the initial environmental risk 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 10/50 
 
 
 
  
 
 
assessment. Hence, the initial environmental risk assessment is still valid and an update is considered 
not necessary. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been performed to support this change in indication. 
It is expected that Tenkasi will not pose a risk to the environment if it will be used in accordance with 
the SmPC. The environmental risk assessment is finalised. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, oritavancin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Study TMC-ORI-11-01 (ORKIDS) 
This is an ongoing Phase 1, open-label, multicentre, sequential study to evaluate the PK, safety and 
tolerability of single-dose oritavancin in paediatric patients aged less than 18 years. The study is part 
of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for oritavancin (EMEA-001270-PIP01-12). 
Method 
•  Bioanalytical method 
Oritavancin plasma concentrations were quantified using a validated LC-MS/MS method. 
The MAH submitted the validation report of method for the determination of oritavancin inhuman 
plasma which was already assessed during the initial marketing authorisation procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/003785). The bioanalytical sample report has not been finalised since study TMC-ORI-11-
01 (ORKIDS) is still ongoing.

Treatments 
The starting dose was chosen by adjusting the adult dose based on weight. In the two pivotal Phase 3 
studies (SOLO I and SOLO II), a single dose of 1200 mg oritavancin was shown to be effective and 
safe in adults for the treatment of ABSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. The average adult 
weight of 80 kg in the SOLO studies and the 1200 mg dose, gave a weight-based dose of 15 mg/kg. 
Oritavancin was administered as a single IV infusion over approximately 3 hours and the dose did not 
exceed 1200 mg. 
Patients were enrolled in a stepwise approach, starting with the oldest age cohort and then progressing 
down the age range after PK and safety analyses had been performed (with the exception of Cohorts 
3b and 4 which were enrolled concurrently): 
•  Cohort 1 (age 12 to <18 years): a single oritavancin dose of 15 mg/kg. 
•  Cohort 2 (6 to <12 years): a single oritavancin dose of 15 mg/kg. 
•  Cohort 3 (age 2 to <6 years): a single oritavancin dose of 15 mg/kg. 
o  Cohort 3b (age 2 to <6 years): a single oritavancin dose of 20 mg/kg. 
•  Cohort 4 (age 3 months to <2 years): a single oritavancin dose of 15 mg/kg. 
•  Cohort 5 (age from birth to <3 months [including neonates from 0 to 28 days]): a single 
oritavancin dose of 15 mg/kg 
Cohorts 1 to 4 are completed. A cohort of 16 children aged from birth to less than 3 months (Cohort 5) 
is currently being investigated. 
The oritavancin formulation used is identical to the formulation currently licensed for treatment of 
adults. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
•  Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). 
Secondary endpoints: 
•  Maximum concentration (Cmax), t½, time of maximum concentration (tmax), Vz, and CL. 
•  Safety assessed according to AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), vital signs (blood pressure, pulse

Most subjects in Cohorts 1-3 had a single infection at baseline, and most subjects in Cohort 3b, 
and Cohort 4 had two infections at baseline. Two subjects in Cohort 3, one subject in Cohort 4 and 
one subject in Cohort 3b) had an MRSA infection. 
Overall, the most frequent infections at baseline were pneumonia (including lobar pneumonia), 
appendicitis perforated, cellulitis, abscess, arthritis bacterial, bacteraemia, and sepsis. 
• 
Primary endpoint – Interim analysis (Cohorts 1 to 4) 
The target exposure range (AUC from baseline to 72 hours) in paediatric subjects was defined based 
on the PK analysis from the two pivotal Phase 3 studies in adults with ABSSSI (SOLO I and SOLO II): 
For Cohorts 1 (12 to <18 years) and 2 (6 to <12 years) the single 15 mg/kg dose resulted in mean 
values of AUC0-72 that were within the lower limit of the target range (965 μg•h/mL) and 20% above 
the upper limit of the target range (2514 μg•h/mL). For Cohort 3 (2 to <6 years), the mean AUC0-72 of 
1300 μg•h/mL was within the target range. However, one of the eight subjects of this cohort failed to 
meet the AUC0-72 target and one subject had an AUC0-72 value very close the lower limit of the target 
range. After reviewing these data, the Sponsor and the DSMB elected to amend the protocol to enrol 
additional subjects in this age group to receive a weight-based oritavancin dose of 20 mg/kg (Cohort 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

3b), with the expectation that this dose increase would achieve the target exposures. The mean AUC0-
72 of Cohort 3b fell within the target range. However, in this cohort four subjects discontinued study 
drug infusion early due to the AE “red man syndrome“ (see safety section for more details). AUC0-72 for 
the three subjects that completed oritavancin administration was increased compared to Cohort 3, 
however the mean value of 2170 μg•h/mL was above the target range, and two of the three subjects 
had exposures above the upper limit. Two of four subjects who discontinued the study drug early met 
the AUC0-72 and two did not. 
In Cohort 4 (3 months to <2 years) the mean AUC0-72 fell within the target range and the AUC0-72 
target was met for those subjects who received the complete dose of oritavancin. In this cohort, one 
subject discontinued study drug due to the adverse event “red man syndrome“. 
Mean AUC0-inf ranged from 1641 μg•h/mL in Cohort 3 to 3161 μg•h/mL in Cohort 1 (Table 3); in adults 
mean AUC0-inf was 2800 µg/ml.

Based on exposure data from clinical studies in adult populations, the target range for AUC0-72 identified 
for the pediatric population  in this study was 965 to 2095 μg•h/mL. 
The AUC/MIC ratio of oritavancin has been shown to correlate best with efficacy. Thus, AUC was 
chosen as primary endpoint to extrapolate efficacy. In Cohorts 1 and 2 mean AUC0-72 was higher than 
the defined upper limit, in Cohort 3 and 4 AUC0-72 was considerably lower but still within the predefined 
limits with the 15 mg/kg dose. With a higher dose of 20 mg/kg the number of AEs increased and 4 out 
of 7 subjects in Cohort 3b discontinued study drug infusion due to red man syndrome. Thus, the 20 
mg/kg dose has not been further evaluated for the paediatric population. Based on the data of study 
TMC-ORI-11-01 and the PopPK model (described below) a single 15 mg/kg dose is applied for 
treatment of children >3 months of age and older with ABSSSI. From the PK point of view, this is 
generally considered acceptable.

The secondary PK parameters are mostly comparable between cohorts. Half-life of oritavancin is about 
1.5-fold higher in adults compared to children (mean value all cohorts). 
Population PK Analysis 
The previously developed popPK model for adults was used to describe paediatric data of the ORKIDS 
study. Parameters were re-estimated using the full dataset of n=297 adults and n=38 paediatric 
patients of four different age cohorts (3 months to <18 years). 
The data available from ORKIDS study (cut-off date 1st December 2020) were prepared using R. 38 
patients, who contributed to 203 observations, were included in the analysis. BQL values (i.e. <0.5 
μg/mL) were flagged in the dataset, such that the algorithm for population analysis considered them 
as normally distributed random values between negative infinity and the limit of quantification (Beal 
M3 method). 
Assumptions on the appropriate compartment numbers were derived by plotting the time courses of 
log-transformed concentrations, and from previous oritavancin PK analysis documented in the ICPD 
report n. 00247-1. A three-compartment model with a zero-order intravenous infusion and first-order 
elimination was therefore tested for both adult and paediatric populations. 
Allometric scaling was used to describe the covariate model linking body size measures to clearances 
and volumes. In addition to total body weight (BW), lean body mass (LBM) was also explored as 
potential covariate. No further covariates (e.g. age, BSA) were tested given their high collinearity. The 
impact of renal function on oritavancin elimination was not tested given its negligible role in oritavancin

excretion. This was also confirmed by the results of oritavancin popPK analysis in adults, where 
creatinine clearance was not found as a significant covariate. For the tested covariates BW and LBM a 
power model was implemented to describe the effects of size on all model parameters, via allometric 
scaling. 
LBM was determined using Peters formula in children and Boer formula in adults, as follows: 
- LBM (kg) = 3.8*(0.0215*WEIGHT(kg)^0.6469*HEIGHT(cm)^0.7236), in children 
- LBM (kg) = 0.407*WEIGHT(kg) + 0.267*HEIGHT(cm) - 19.2, in male adults 
- LBM (kg) = 0.252*WEIGHT(kg) + 0.473*HEIGHT(cm) - 48.3, in female adults. 
Using the parameter estimates obtained from the final model, a series of simulation scenarios were 
implemented to assess the suitability of the 15 mg/kg dose for the paediatric population along with the 
predicted probability of target attainment across different age groups. 
Population PK analyses were performed in Monolix, version 2019R1, whereas the application 
Sycomore, version 2019R1, was used for a visual and interactive exploration of the tested models. 
Dataset preparation, as well as model simulations, were performed in R. 
Oritavancin plasma concentrations over time are presented on a semi-log scale as spaghetti-plots, by 
cohort (Figure 1). Oritavancin plasma concentrations were obtained after a single oritavancin dose of 
15 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg, infused intravenously over 3 hours. Data demographics are summarised in 
Table 4.

Table 4: Summary of demographic characteristics of patients in ORKIDS study. 
A popPK model was developed for oritavancin PK data based on a previous model (Table 5, Figure 2) 
collected from an adult population of 297 subjects. The best structural popPK model was a three-
compartment model with zero-order infusion and fist-order elimination. The model was parameterized 
using total clearance (CL), volume of distribution of the central compartment (V1), distributional 
clearances and volume of distribution of the peripheral compartments (Q2,Q3 and V2,V3, 
respectively). CL, V1, and Q2 were modelled as correlated parameters. IIV was estimated for all PK 
parameters, using an exponential model. Lastly, the residual error model included a single proportional 
error term. 
Covariate analysis identified LBM as a better descriptor of IIV compared to BW, for all model 
parameters. Covariate relationships between LBM and model parameters were implemented via power 
functions describing allometric scaling. 
Population parameter estimates are listed in Table 6, GOF plots showed the ability of the final model to 
describe the observed concentration-time data in Figure 3.

The same structural popPK model (three-compartment model with zero-order infusion and first order 
elimination) used for adults was adopted for the paediatric population. As for adult data, IIV was 
estimated using an exponential model for all PK parameters, and the residual error model included a 
single proportional error term. Given the sparse sampling scheme in the ORKIDS study, only 
correlation between CL and V1 could be identified. 
Allometric principles were assumed as the only relevant factors. In addition to BW, also LBM was 
evaluated as an additional measure of body size. This analysis compared LBM as a descriptor of IIV 
compared to BW. Correlations between random effects and other covariates are showed in Figure 7.

Simulations 
A virtual population of 10000 paediatric subjects (aged 0 - <18 years) was created to perform 
simulations. Six age groups (12-18 y, 6-12 y, 2-6 y, 3 m-2 y, 14 d-3 m, and 0-14 d) of 2000 subjects 
each were created sampling age from random uniform distributions, and sex from random binomial 
distributions. Body weights and heights were generated based on the Center for Disease Control (CDC) 
growth charts. 
Children and adults are expected to show similar response to treatment, if exposures over the 72-hour 
period are comparable across the two populations. Thus, the AUC0-72 target range for an effective 
treatment in children was set as 965-2095 μg•h/mL, which corresponds to the mean  
AUC0-72 ± 1 standard deviation obtained from adult Phase 3 studies. Simulations of oritavancin 
concentrations in the virtual paediatric population showed that the 15 mg/kg dose resulted in median 
AUC0-72 values within the target range for all age groups, including neonates (Figure 8, Figure 9) (blue 
boxplots). On the other hand, simulations of lower doses of 10 mg/kg in neonates revealed that this 
dose results in an AUC0-72 range which is considerably lower than the target exposure for a large 
proportion of subjects. In fact, the corresponding median AUC0-72 value fell below the therapeutic 
range, Figure 13, and the overall distribution of exposures in this group diverged from the reference 
AUC0-72 distribution in adults (Figure 10). 
About 17% of all children had simulated exposures higher than the upper cut-off of the target range 
(2095 μg•h/mL), and 5% of all simulated children had exposures higher than 2514 μg•h/mL. These 
high exposure values corresponded mainly to children who received the 20 mg/kg dose, or subjects 
with values of LBM greater than 33 kg.

2.3.2.  PK/PD modelling 
Post-hoc AUC0-72 estimates were derived to obtain individual AUC0-72/MIC ratios. AUC0-72/MIC ratio 
greater than the preclinical PK-PD target value (3941 and 4581 for net bacterial stasis and 1-log10 CFU 
reduction, respectively) was defined as the desired therapeutic target, and used for the calculation of 
the probability of target attainment.

Figure 11: 
Barplots of the MIC distribution for oritavancin against S. aureus, by age 
groups. Source data: surveillance data of clinical isolates from medical centres 
in the US and Europe (2008-2019) 
MIC distributions displayed in Figure 11 show the comparison in the susceptibility distribution of the 
pathogen between adults and children. The combined distribution of adult and paediatric isolates was 
used for the analysis. The probability of target attainment (PTA) in the paediatric population was 
estimated using the AUC0-72 values for simulated paediatric patients in combination with the non-
clinical AUC0-72/MIC ratio targets for efficacy against S. aureus. Percent probabilities of PK-PD target 
attainment were assessed at individual fixed MIC values spanning the MIC distribution for oritavancin 
against S. aureus based on surveillance data collected from medical centres in the USA and Europe 
(2008-2019). Overall PTA was calculated as the weighted average of PTA values, using MIC distribution 
values as weights. 
Oritavancin susceptibility breakpoint for S. aureus was set to 0.12 mg/L. High probabilities of target 
attainment for S. aureus were predicted in adults for the MIC value of 0.25 mg/L for net bacterial 
stasis (85%; Table 8, Table 9). PTA analysis in the virtual paediatric population showed that, at a MIC 
value of 0.12 mg/L, oritavancin 15 mg/kg dose resulted in percent probabilities of PK-PD target 
attainment equal to 100% for all age groups. Results associated with all tested doses and age groups 
are displayed in Table 8 and Figure 12 for net bacterial stasis, and in Table 9 and Figure 13 for 1-log10 
CFU reduction from baseline. Noteworthy, in children aged 2-6 years both 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg 
doses resulted in PTA values above 97% for the 0.25 mg/L MIC value, supporting the recommendation 
of 15 mg/kg as target dose in this age group. 
A dose of 10 mg/kg resulted in 131/2000 neonates (around 6.5%) not reaching the PK-PD target at 
0.12 mg/L MIC value; Table 9 (1-log10 CFU reduction from baseline). A substantial drop in the PTA 
value was observed for the 10 mg/kg dose at the MIC value of 0.25 mg/L, compared with the 15 
mg/kg dose in the same age group, and in older subjects. Specifically, PTA values dropped from 78% 
to 11.95% for net bacterial stasis, and from 52.8 to 2.95 for 1-log10 CFU reduction from baseline.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The application relies on the concept of extrapolation of clinical efficacy based on comparable plasma 
exposures in children and adults. The acceptance of extrapolation is based on assumptions that the 
disease, mechanism of action and thus PK/PD are the same in paediatric patients as in adults and 
therefore the selected dose should achieve similar plasma exposures and probability of PK/PD target 
attainment (PTA) in children as in adults. AUC/MIC ratio of oritavancin has been shown to correlate 
best with efficacy. Thus, AUC after a single oritavancin dose was chosen as primary endpoint in study 
TMC-ORI-11-01. A target range of 965-2095 μg•h/ml for AUC0-72 had been defined based on pooled 
data of the two pivotal Phase 3 studies SOLO I and SOLO II. A popPK model developed in 2013 using 
adult data (n=297) from phase 3 clinical studies was updated with paediatric data (n=38) to predict 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 31/50 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
exposure of oritavancin in children from 3 months to <18 years of age. Allometric scaling was used to 
link body size measurements to paediatric clearances and volumes; this methodology is regarded as 
appropriate. The MAH also further clarified that as only sparse samples were collected in ORKIDS 
study, the MAH adopted an extrapolation approach (Cella et al., Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2010) based on 
leveraging extensive PK data from Phase 3 studies in adults and applying allometric principles. Despite 
limited paediatric data were available, this approach ensured the definition of an appropriate popPK 
model to characterise oritavancin pharmacokinetics in children. Adult and paediatric data were not 
pooled together because the merged dataset, comprising rich adult data (n = 297) and limited 
paediatric data (n = 38), would result not balanced in representing both populations. 
The previous PK model in adults and the new model in adults have different covariates. In the 
“previous“ PK model in adults, age was found statistically significant on central volume of distribution 
(V1) and height on clearance (CL) with estimated coefficients of -0.641 and 0.695, respectively. No 
other covariates were found statistically significant on the other parameters. However, in terms of 
allometry, age and height are not physiologically relevant, contrary to measures of body size, such as 
body weight, lean body mass (LBM), etc. In the “new ” allometry-based adult model, all volumes and 
clearances have been allometrically scaled by LBM, fixing the exponents to 1 for volumes and 0.75 for 
clearances, as recommended by allometry theory. 
Despite these differences, when the distributions of the individual model parameter values are 
compared, no significant differences can be observed between the “previous” and the “new” model for 
all parameters. More precisely, the distributions of model parameters of the new model are comparable 
with the distributions of model parameters from the previous model. 
In the popPK model allometric scaling was used with fixed exponents for Cl and V (0.75 and 1, 
respectively), whereas allometry was not taken into account for dosing (15 mg/kg for all age cohorts). 
This lead to high exposures predicted in older patients (Cohort 1) and lower exposures in younger 
patients (Cohort 3, Cohort 4). Medians of the simulated exposures were simulated to be within the 
predefined range of 965-2095 hr*µg/mL. 
Simulations showed decreasing exposures with decreasing age as a general trend, whereas observed 
exposure data revealed higher exposure in Cohort 4 compared to Cohort 3. This effect was not 
described by the popPK model and is therefore not apparent in simulations, which is revealing further 
insecurities of the model. One aspect regarding this issue could be that initially no maturation factor 
was included into the model although the indication included patients from an age of three months. 
The MAH has subsequently explained that variability and changes in oritavancin PK due to 
developmental growth were best described by LBM, which is a measure of body size and therefore 
could account for both modification in body composition and developmental changes, as maturation. It 
was then considered a new model in which both size and maturation would shape the clearance 
process presented. However, adding a maturation factor did not improve the predictions for the 
youngest age group due to limited data available for patients <2 years of age. The MAH assured to re-
evaluate a maturation factor for modelling when data of Cohort 5 (age from birth to 3 months) will be 
available (recruitment is open). 
The submitted PTA analysis for S. aureus are considered supportive that the chosen 15 mg/kg is 
effective in the paediatric population. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Based on the submitted PK data described above, the 15 mg/kg dose for treatment of paediatric 
patients aged >3 months and older is generally considered acceptable to extrapolate efficacy.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Not applicable since no new efficacy data have been submitted. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The original MAA included safety data from 3017 oritavancin-treated adults from 22 clinical trials, 
including data from 2149 adult patients from Phase 3 ABSSSI trials. 
The primary safety analysis relies on pooled safety data from the two identical designed, pivotal Phase 
3 studies in adults (SOLO I and SOLO II) in which 976 adults treated with oritavancin. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5%) were nausea, hypersensitivity reactions, 
infusion site reactions, and headache. The most commonly reported serious adverse reaction was 
cellulitis (1.1%). The most common reported reasons for discontinuation were cellulitis (0.4%) and 
osteomyelitis (0.3%).  
Patient exposure 
In study TMC-ORI-11-01 (described in the PK section) 38 paediatric patients aged 3 months to less 
than 18 years received a single dose of 15-20 mg/kg oritavancin (31 patients: 15 mg/kg, 7 patients: 
20 mg/kg) and were included in the safety population. Patients were followed for 14 days and also 
contacted by phone at Day 60 to collect any AEs. 
The mean total dose of oritavancin in the first three age cohorts was 926.3 mg (mean weight 69.3 kg), 
622.5 mg (mean weight 41.5 kg), 210 mg (mean weight 14.0 kg), respectively. In Cohort 3b the mean 
total dose of oritavancin was 270.7 mg (mean weight 17.4 kg), and in Cohort 4 it was 155.2 mg (mean 
weight 11.6 kg).  
Adverse events 
In study TMC-ORI-11-01, considering all dosed patients (oritavancin doses 15 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg), 25 
(65.8%) patients reported at least one AE; 14 (36.8%) reported at least one ADR; 5 (13.2%) 
experienced an AE leading to treatment discontinuation; and 5 (13.2%) experienced at least one 
serious adverse event (SAE). 
Considering the patients who received oritavancin 15 mg/kg, 18 (58.1%) patients reported at least 
one AE; 9 (29.0%) reported at least one ADR; 1 (3.2%) experienced an AE leading to treatment 
discontinuation; and 4 (12.9%) experienced at least SAE (Table 7).

Table 10:  AEs reported by age and dose cohort, overall by dose and overall in study TMC-
ORI-11-01 and in the oritavancin arm of the Phase 3 studies SOLO I and II in 
adults (safety population). 
Considering all dosed patients in study TMC-ORI-11-01 (oritavancin doses 15 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg), the 
ADRs reported in more than one patient were red man syndrome (5/38 [13.2%] patients), hepatic 
enzyme increased (2/38 [5.3%]) and vomiting (2/38 [5.3%]) ( 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 34/50 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Table 11). 
Considering the patients who received oritavancin 15 mg/kg, the ADRs reported in more than one 
patient were hepatic enzyme increased (2/31 [6.5%]), and vomiting (2/31 [6.5%]) ( 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 35/50 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Table 11). 
Vomiting was also common in the adult population who received oritavancin in the SOLO pool, hepatic 
enzyme increased was reported by only 1 (0.1%) patient in the SOLO pool and no cases of red man 
syndrome were reported.  
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity. 
Considering all dosed patients in study TMC-ORI-11-01 (oritavancin doses 15 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg), 
severe AEs occurred in 4 (10.5%) patients: headache (Cohort 2), red man syndrome (Cohort 3b), 
chest pain (Cohort 3b), and enterococcal endocarditis and diarrhoea (Cohort 3). 
Considering the patients who received oritavancin 15 mg/kg, severe AEs occurred in 2 (6.5%) 
patients.

Cases of red man syndrome: 
 • Study participant from Cohort 4 dosed at 15 mg/kg,  22-month-old American Indian or Alaska 
Native male Hispanic or Latino with a diagnosis of appendicitis perforated with periappendiceal abscess 
treated non-operatively. The patient experienced the non-serious AE “red man syndrome” on Day 1 
that lead to the study drug discontinuation. The AE was of mild severity and definitively related to the 
study drug. After 73 minutes of oritavancin infusion was discontinued as the subject was itching, fussy, 
red on face and ears. The event was treated with diphenhydramine and resolved 25 minutes later. The 
subject also experienced the SAE device occlusion (occlusion of peripherally inserted central device) on 
Day 2, the event was of mild intensity, unrelated and resolved after 2 days. Final dose received was 
91.3 mg (5.93 mg/kg) at an infusion rate of 4.06 mL/kg/hour. 
• Study participant from Cohort 3b dosed at 20 mg/kg, a 2-year-old white male Hispanic or Latino 
with a diagnosis of device related infection (Broviac line); pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus (Gram 
positive). On Day 1 the subject experienced the non-serious AE “red man Syndrome”. It was of mild 
severity, definitively related to the study drug, and led to study drug discontinuation. After 90 minutes 
oritavancin infusion it was discontinued as the subject presented red rash to face, ears and under chin. 
The event was treated with diphenhydramine and resolved 1 hour and 24 minutes later. The patient 
experienced also the following SAEs: pyrexia (start on Day 3), neutropenia (start on Day 50), pyrexia 
(start on Day 50), thrombophlebitis superficial (start on Day 55) and medical device complication 
(start on Day 62). All were reported as of mild intensity, unrelated to the study drug and recovered. 
Final dose received was 130 mg (9.7 mg/kg) at an infusion rate of 5.40 mL/kg/hour.  
• Study participant from Cohort 3b dosed at 20 mg/kg, a 5-year-old Black or African American female 
Hispanic or Latino, with a diagnosis of abscess of right external ear and mastoiditis; pathogens: 
Streptococcus Grp A (Gram positive) and Beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (Gram positive). On Day 1, 
the subject experienced the non-serious AE “red man syndrome”. It was of severe intensity, 
definitively related to the study drug, and lead to study drug discontinuation. After 60 minutes of 
oritavancin infusion the subject developed some mild itching over body and scalp, at about 90 minutes 
of oritavancin infusion a mild rash began to develop at her neck and an urticarial lesion began to 
develop in a single location (approx. 4-6 cm proximal to the IV catheter tip). The sensation of itching 
of the scalp increased at this time. The infusion was permanently discontinued after 109 minutes due 
to Red man syndrome. The event was treated with Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and resolved 1 hour 
and 34 minutes later. The patient did not experience any other AE. Final dose received was 224.7 mg 
(12.0 mg/kg) at an infusion rate of 5.59 mL/kg/hour. 
• Study participant from Cohort 3b dosed at 20 mg/kg, a 3-year-old white male Hispanic or Latino, 
with a diagnosis of pneumonia; pathogens: Streptococcus species (Gram positive). On Day 1 the 
subject experienced the non-serious AE “red man syndrome”. It was of moderate intensity, definitively 
related to the study drug, and lead to study drug discontinuation. After 133 minutes of oritavancin 
infusion the subject began to cry and developed some mild itching which started at his head and 
progressed down to his arms, hands, and torso. The infusion was permanently discontinued and the 
redness decreased significantly with just small erythematous patches under his eyes. The event was 
treated with Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and resolved within 1 hour and 30 minutes after the infusion 
was stopped. The patient did not experience any other AE. Final dose received was 252.0 mg (14.5 
mg/kg) at an infusion rate of 5.44 mL/kg/hour.  
• Study participant from Cohort 3b dosed at 20 mg/kg, a 2-year-old white female with a diagnosis of 
left neck abscess and lymphadenitis; pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin resistant) (Gram 
positive). On Day 1, the subject experienced the non-serious AE “red man syndrome”. It was of 
moderate intensity, definitively related to the study drug, and lead to study drug discontinuation. After 
73 minutes of oritavancin infusion the subject began to complain of itching which started on scalp and 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

progressed down to her forehead. The infusion was permanently discontinued and Benadryl 
(diphenhydramine) was administered. The redness began to decrease within 30 minutes. Subject 
continued to complain of scalp itching for another 30 minutes. All symptoms resolved 2 hours after the 
infusion was stopped. The patient did not experience any other AE. Final dose received was 101.8 mg 
(8.0 mg/kg) at an infusion rate of 5.49 mL/kg/hour. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were no deaths reported in study TMC-ORI-11-01. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
Five subjects, one in each age cohort, had SAEs. SAEs included small intestinal obstruction in Cohort 1, 
C. difficile colitis  in Cohort 2, Enterococcal endocarditis  in Cohort 3, Pyrexia, Neutropenia, 
Thrombophlebitis superficial, and Medical device complication  in Cohort 3b (2 to <6 years), and 
Device occlusion  in Cohort 4 (3 months to <2 years). Only the C. difficile colitis was assessed by the 
investigator as possibly related to oritavancin 
SAEs reported in subjects dosed at 15 mg/kg were: 
• Study participant from Cohort 1 dosed at 15mg/kg, a 15-year-old white male, Hispanic or Latino, 
with a polymicrobial (intra-abdominal) infection, experienced small intestinal obstruction on Day 1, the 
event was considered serious, of moderate severity, unrelated to the study drug and resolved after 15 
days. The patient also had a non-serious AE, hepatic enzyme increased, that started on Day 8, the 
event was mild, possibly related, and recovered after 51 days.  
• Study participant from Cohort 2 dosed at 15 mg/kg, a 9-year-old white female with community-
acquired left lower lung pneumonia, experienced Clostridioides difficile colitis on Day 23, the event was 
considered serious, of mild severity, possibly related to the study drug, and resolved after 7 days. The 
patient had also AST increased (start on Day 5), viral upper respiratory tract infection (start on Day 
11), and skin exfoliation (start on Day 11). All were non serious, of mild intensity and resolved. AST 
increase was possibly related to the study drug.  
• Study participant from Cohort 3 dosed at 15 mg/kg, a 2-year-old white female Hispanic or Latino 
with bacteraemia (Enterococcus faecalis [Gram-positive] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [Gram-
negative]). On Day 25, the subject had severe enterococcal endocarditis that was reported as a serious 
adverse event, of severe intensity and unrelated to the study drug. The central line was removed and 
the treatment with ampicillin was initiated. 
Enterococcal endocarditis was considered resolved with sequelae 28 days after.  
• Study participant from Cohort 4 dosed at 15 mg/kg, a 22-month-old American Indian or Alaska 
Native male Hispanic or Latino with a diagnosis of appendicitis perforated with periappendiceal abscess 
treated non-operatively. The subject experienced the SAE device occlusion (occlusion of peripherally 
inserted central device) on Day 2, the event was of mild intensity, unrelated and resolved after 2 days. 
The patient experienced the nonserious AE red man syndrome on Day 1 that lead to the study drug 
discontinuation. The AE was of mild severity and definitively related to the study drug.  
SAEs reported in the subject dosed at 20 mg/kg were: 
• Study participant from Cohort 3b, a 2-year-old white male Hispanic or Latino with a diagnosis of 
device related infection (Broviac line); pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive), experienced 
the following SAEs: pyrexia (start on Day 3), neutropenia (start on Day 50), pyrexia (start on Day 50), 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 39/50 
 
 
 
 
  
 
thrombophlebitis superficial (start on Day 55) and medical device complication (start on Day 62). All 
were reported as of mild intensity, unrelated to the study drug and recovered. The patient experienced 
the non-serious AE red man syndrome on Day 1 that lead to the study drug discontinuation. The AE 
was of mild severity and definitively related to the study drug. 
Other significant adverse events 
Five (13.2%) patients experienced the AE red man syndrome leading to study drug discontinuation; 4 
in Cohort 3b (age 2 to < 6 years who received oritavancin 20 mg/kg) and 1 in Cohort 4 (age 3 months 
to < 2 years who received oritavancin 15 mg/kg). In all 5 cases the red man syndrome was reported 
as non-serious, definitively related to the study drug, and resolved after study drug discontinuation 
and treatment with diphenhydramine. Two cases were of mild intensity, two moderate and one severe 
(details described in section adverse events). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Hypersensitivity 
There were no reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock in study TMC-
ORI-11-01.  
Considering all patients, overall 10 (26.3%) had potentially hypersensitivity, of which 5 (13.8%) were 
red man syndrome and the rest of AEs affected one patient each. All cases of red man syndrome, 
hypersensitivity, and rash were considered as definitively related to the study drug. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Three AEs were identified (infusion site extravasation, vessel puncture site swelling, and 
thrombophlebitis superficial) that occurred to patient in Cohort 3b (dosed at 20 mg/kg). 
Thrombophlebitis superficial starting on D55 was reported as a SAE of mild intensity, unrelated to the 
study drug, and resolved after 8 days. Infusion site extravasation and vessel puncture site swelling 
starting on Day 43 and Day 62 respectively, were reported as non-serious AEs of mild intensity, 
unrelated to the study drug and resolved after 2 and 5 days, respectively. 
Red man syndrome 
Red man syndrome occurred in a greater number of patients who received oritavancin 20 mg/kg than 
in those who received oritavancin 15 mg/kg (4/7 [57.1%] vs 1/31 [3.2%], respectively). 
Pseudomembranous colitis/Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhoea 
Clostridioides difficile colitis occurred in 1 patient (Cohort 2, dosed at 15 mg/kg; see section SAEs for 
details). 
Osteomyelitis 
There were no reports of osteomyelitis in study TMC-ORI-11-01. 
Nephrotoxicity/Increase in uric acid levels 
Uric acid concentrations were not monitored during trial TMC-ORI-11-01, however, no AEs related to 
increased uric acid concentrations were observed. 
Increase in transaminases 
In study TMC-ORI-11-01, 5 patients experienced AEs related to transaminase increase (hepatic 
enzyme increased, AST increased, and liver function test abnormal). All of them occurred in the age 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

cohorts dosed at 15 mg/kg, none of them were serious, all were of mild intensity and in 4 cases were 
considered as related to the study drug: 
• Study participant from Cohort 1, a 15-year-old white male, Hispanic or Latino, with a polymicrobial 
(intra-abdominal) infection, had an AE of hepatic enzyme increased starting on Day 8. The values of 
ALT and AST were within the normal range at Screening (16 U/L and 22 U/L, respectively) and on Day 
3 (22 U/L and 30 U/L, respectively) that increased on Day 8 (66 U/L and 51 U/L, respectively), the 
peak value for ALT was reached on Day 15 (114 U/L >3 × ULN) and for AST on Day 36 (56 U/L < 1.5 
× ULN). On Day 58 ALT and AST normalised (24 U/L and 28 U/L, respectively). 
Concomitant medications immediately prior to the hepatic enzymes increase included acetaminophen 
1000 mg IV as needed, ibuprofen 600 mg orally as needed, and erythromycin 200 mg IV once daily, 
and these are known to cause hepatotoxicity. The event was mild, considered possibly related to the 
study drug and recovered after 51 days. This patient had also an SAE of post-operative worsening of 
small intestinal obstruction due to adhesions.  
• Study participant from Cohort 1, a 12 year old white female with pelvic abscess and peritonitis had 
an AE of hepatic enzyme increased starting on Day 3. The values of ALT and AST were within the 
normal range at Screening (28 U/L and 23 U/L, respectively), on Day 3 ALT increased (36 U/L) and 
AST was within the normal range (35 U/L). On Day 13, both peaked (49 U/L and 54 U/L, < 2 × ULN 
respectively); 155 after the study drug administration ALT was over the normal limit (39 U/L) and AST 
was within the normal range (37 U/L) and 169 days after the study drug administration ALT and AST 
were increased (38 U/L and 49 U/L, respectively). The adverse event was reported as non serious, of 
mild intensity, possibly related to the study drug and not resolved. The patient did not experience any 
other AE. 
• Study participant from Cohort 2, a 9-year-old white female with community-acquired left lower lung 
pneumonia, had an AE of AST increase starting on day 5. The values of AST were within the normal 
range at Screening (43 U/L) and on Day 3 (39 U/L) and on Day 5 increased to 69 U/L (< 2 × ULN). By 
Day 15, AST was within the normal range (34 U/L). The event was non serious, of mild intensity, 
possibly related to the study drug and resolved. The patient also experienced the SAE Clostridioides 
difficile colitis on Day 23.  
• Study participant from Cohort 2, an 11-year-old white male with bacterial arthritis of the right hip, 
had an AE of liver function test abnormal starting of Day 3. The values of ALT and AST were within the 
normal range at Screening (22 U/L and 28 U/L, respectively) and increased considerably on Day 3 
(234 U/L and 307 U/L, > 5 × ULN respectively). The concomitant medications immediately prior to the 
elevation in ALT and AST included Valium 4 mg orally as needed for muscle spasm prophylaxis, 
cefazolin 1000 mg IV every 8 hours and cephalexin 250 mg orally every 6 hours for the septic arthritis 
that may have played a role in the event. ALT and AST decreased to 28 U/L and 29 U/L on Day 14, 
respectively. The event was non serious, of mild intensity, definitively related to the study drug and 
resolved. Total bilirubin concentrations remained below the ULN during the study (Screening: 12.0 
μmol/L, Day 3: 13.7 μmol/L, and Day 15: 6.8 μmol/L). The patient did not experience any other AE. 
• Study participant from Cohort 3, a 2-year-old white female, Hispanic or Latino, with bacteraemia, 
had an AE of hepatic enzyme increased starting on Day 18. The value of ALT was slightly increased at 
Screening (43 U/L) and AST was within the normal range (40 U/L), both were within the normal range 
on Day 3 (40 U/L and 28 U/L, respectively) and increased on Day 12 (42 U/L and 71 U/L, < 2 × ULN 
respectively). The AE was considered resolved 42 days after its onset, however, no further lab results 
were reported. The AE was not serious, of mild intensity, and unlikely related to the study drug. This 
patient also experienced the SAE on Day 25 and several other AEs.  
Vestibular toxicity/ototoxicity 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 41/50 
 
 
 
 
  
 
In study TMC-ORI-11-01, the only AE consistent with vestibular toxicity was dizziness in 1/38 (2.6%) 
patient (Cohort 3b) and there were no AEs related to ototoxicity. In addition, 2/38 (5.3%) patients had 
acute otitis media. 
Haematologic effects (cytopenia) 
Considering all patients, overall 4 (10.5%) had cytopenia related AEs, out of them 3 (7.9%) had 
anaemia, 2 (5.3%) had neutropenia which were considered unrelated to study drug. One case of 
neutropenia was reported as a SAE. 
Considering all patients dosed at 15 mg/kg, overall 3 (9.7%) had cytopenia related AEs. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In trial TMC-ORI-11-01, mean changes in haematology parameters from Baseline over time showed 
slight fluctuations, but these changes were similar across the paediatric cohorts and were not 
considered clinically significant. 
Liver Function Tests 
In study TMC-ORI-11-01, there was no evidence of liver toxicity with oritavancin in any of the cohorts. 
Mean changes from Baseline over time in LFTs were minimal and similar between the cohorts. Shifts in 
LFTs over time did not reveal any meaningful differences in any of the cohorts. 
No patient met Hy’s law criteria. Potentially clinically significant LFT abnormalities (i.e., ALT ≥ 3 × ULN, 
AST ≥ 3 × ULN, alkaline phosphatase ≥ 1.5 × ULN, or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN) were observed in 
2/38 (5.3%) subjects. 
Renal function 
No evidence of renal toxicity was seen in any of the cohorts. Mean change from Baseline in BUN and 
creatinine showed slight fluctuations, but these changes were similar across the cohorts and were not 
considered clinically significant. 
No consistent trend was seen over time for shifts in either BUN or creatinine in any of the cohorts and 
no patient had an abnormality in renal function tests reported as an AE. Only one AE of haematuria 
was reported in Cohort 3 that was not drug related. 
Other serum chemistry tests 
In trial TMC-ORI-11-01, mean change from Baseline in other serum chemistry tests were minimal and 
similar across the cohorts. No consistent trend was seen over time for shifts in other serum chemistry 
tests and no patient had an abnormality in the other serum chemistry tests reported as an AE. 
Electrocardiograms 
Most patients in each of the cohorts had normal ECG findings at Baseline and post-baseline, with most 
of the ECG abnormalities seen at Baseline resolving post-baseline. The mean (SD) ΔQTcF was 1.20 
(27.80) ms and the 90% CI was -14.97 to 17.37. Treatment-emergent new or worsening ECG findings 
were seen in 3 patients overall. In one patient (Cohort 3) prolonged QT interval (baseline: 377 ms, 
470 ms on the day of oritavancin administration) was reported as non serious, moderate and definitely 
related to study drug. It resolved and was not associated with any other AEs. Unfortunately, no repeat 
ECG was recorded. Concomitant medications included acetaminophen 240 mg as needed, amoxicillin 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 42/50 
 
 
 
 
  
 
720 mg twice daily, and ampicillin 800 mg IV every 6 hours. The patient did not experience any other 
AE. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Four subjects in Cohort 3b (age 2 to < 6 years who received oritavancin 20 mg/kg) and one subject in 
Cohort 4 (age 3 months to < 2 years who received oritavancin 15 mg/kg) discontinued study drug due 
to the AE red man syndrome. Two cases were reported as mild (15 mg/kg dose), two as moderate and 
one severe (each at 20 mg/kg dose). All resolved with treatment. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Thirty-eight subjects were dosed in study TMC-ORI-11-01, of which five discontinued study drug early 
due to developing AEs consistent with red man syndrome. Four of seven subjects discontinued study 
drug early due to developing AEs of red man syndrome at the dose level of 20 mg/kg (Cohort 3b). In 
contrast, only one of 31 subjects discontinued drug early due to developing an AE of red man 
syndrome at the dose level of 15 mg/kg. Consistently, AEs were reported by more patients from 
Cohort 3b (2 to less than 6 years of age) who received oritavancin 20 mg/kg with all 7/7 (100%) 
patients reporting AEs. In contrast, AEs were reported by 5/8 (62.5%) patients from the same age 
group (Cohort 3) who received oritavancin 15 mg/kg. Hence, this dose has not been further evaluated 
for the paediatric population. 
Hypersensitivity reactions and infusion related reactions that resemble red man syndrome have been 
reported with oritavancin and are included in the product information (SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
The risk of red man syndrome may increase with the concentration or infusion rate. The MAH further 
explained that increasing infusion time would impact Cmax (and not AUC), therefore it was explored if 
any relationship between Cmax and probability of RMS could be retrieved from the available data. 
Results from logistic regression showed that, based on the available data, changes in Cmax would not 
impact the probability of RMS (p-value of 0.15, not significant). A greater number of RMS cases were 
reported in patients who received oritavancin 20 mg/kg (4/5) than in those who received oritavancin 
15 mg/kg (1/5). Patients who received the 20 mg/kg dose had a higher infusion rate than patients who 
received 15 mg/kg, and this may have increased the risk for infusion-related reactions. It is agreed 
that the 3-hour infusion time is considered adequate for the paediatric population. 
Overall, in subjects receiving the 15 mg/kg dose, the AEs reported during this study were consistent 
with the known safety profile for oritavancin in adults. Three probably related AEs (one case each) ECG 
QT prolonged, irritability and Clostrioides difficile colitis were reported which are currently not listed in 
the product information of Tenkasi based on data of the Phase 3 studies SOLO I and II in adults. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The paediatric safety data base is very limited but overall, the safety data of the 15 mg/kg dose in the 
paediatric population are comparable to safety data in adults and no safety concern is posed based on 
the measured Cmax values. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle 
Based on lack of long-term safety data in paediatric population, the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
already existing entry in the EURD list for oritavancin needs to be amended as follows: the PSUR cycle 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 43/50 
 
 
 
 
  
 
for the medicinal product should follow a yearly cycle (instead of 3-yearly cycle). The next data lock 
point (upon extension of indication approval and after current DLP) will be 19 March 2024. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 5.0 with DLP 31 Mar 2022 with this application.  
The RMP has been updated to include information on oritavancin used in the paediatric population aged 
3 months to <18 years, in order to support the extension of oritavancin’s indication to this age group.  
The MAH has updated the RMP to version 5.1 during this procedure, Part II Module SVI has been 
updated to align with EMA’s Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) assessment, dated 20 May 2022 
(procedure number: EMA/PDCO/117516/2022), on potential long term safety/efficacy issues in relation 
to paediatric use. 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5.1 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

2.7.  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation activities as described in Part V.1 of the RMP are sufficient to manage the 
safety concerns of the medicinal product. 
2.8.  Conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). 
2.9.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC 
have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reason: 
the information given in the PL only slightly differs from the approved PL in regard to the paediatric 
information included. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The following extension of indication is applied: 
Treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults and paediatric 
patients aged 3 months and older. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is a need for making new antibacterial agents available also to the paediatric population that will 
effectively treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria including resistant pathogens such as 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study TMC-ORI-11-01 is an ongoing Phase 1, open-label, multicentre, sequential study to evaluate the 
PK, safety and tolerability of single-dose oritavancin in paediatric patients aged less than 18 years. The 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 47/50 
 
 
 
 
  
 
study is part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan for oritavancin. Thirty-eight paediatric patients >3 
months of age (Cohorts 1 to 4) with a confirmed or suspected Gram-positive infection received a single 
dose (15 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg) of oritavancin which was infused over 3 hours. Primary endpoint of the 
study was AUC to extrapolate efficacy. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In all age groups AUC0-72 was higher than the lower limit of the predefined target range (965 
μg•h/ml) with the applied 15 mg/kg dose. PTA analyses support that the chosen dose is effective in 
the paediatric population. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The primary objectives of study TCM-ORI-11-01 were to evaluate PK and safety/tolerability of 
oritavancin in the paediatric population.  No clinical efficacy data are available and conclusion of 
efficacy is solely based on PK/PD data. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Five subjects discontinued study drug early due to developing AEs consistent with red man syndrome. 
Four of these patients received the 20 mg/kg dose indicating that the risk of infusion-related reactions 
may increase with the concentration or infusion rate. Based on the available data an infusion time of 3 
hours is considered adequate for the paediatric population and the applied dose of 15 mg/kg. 
Overall, in subjects receiving the 15 mg/kg dose, the AEs reported during this study were consistent 
with the known safety profile for oritavancin in adults. Three probably related AEs (one case each) ECG 
QT prolonged, irritability and C. difficile colitis were reported which are currently not listed in the 
product information of Tenkasi. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The paediatric safety database is of limited size. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The application relies on the concept of extrapolation of clinical efficacy based on comparable plasma 
exposures in children and adults. The acceptance of extrapolation is based on assumptions that the 
disease, mechanism of action and thus PK/PD are the same in paediatric patients as in adults and 
therefore the selected dose should achieve similar plasma exposures and probability of PK/PD target 
attainment (PTA) in children as in adults. The proposed dose in children >3 months of age is a single 
dose of 15 mg/kg (maximum 1,200 mg) infused over 3 hours. Based on similar exposure in the 
paediatric population as in adults and satisfactory PTA it is anticipated that the recommended 
paediatric doses will be effective and safe in the paediatric population. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 48/50 
 
 
 
 
  
 
The paediatric safety database is of limited size but could be acceptable. No new risks were identified 
and based on the data provided the safety profile in the paediatric population and the dosage applied 
for seems to be comparable to that established in adults. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The balance of benefits and risks for the extension of indication of Tenkasi to include paediatric 
patients >3 months of age and older is positive. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Tenkasi is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

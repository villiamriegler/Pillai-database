SmPC and 
The results obtained from a long-term follow-up extension 
Paediatric SmPC in order to reflect information on 
the long-term antibody persistence and immune 
memory up to 15 years after primary immunisation 
of adolescents, based on data from Phase IV study 
HAB-084 EXT Y11-15 (An open, long-term follow-up 
study to evaluate long-term antibody persistence and 
immune memory between 11 and 15 years after the 
primary study HAB-084). In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 10.1. 
Annex II 
study conducted in healthy adolescents of 12-15 years, 
tested 15 years after the primary vaccination with Twinrix 
Paediatric, showed anti-HAV seropositivity rates of 100% 
and anti-HBs seroprotection rates of 81.8%. These data 
show the long-term persistence of immune memory for 
both hepatitis A and B vaccination with Twinrix Paediatric, 
suggesting a sustained long term protection.

Based on a review of literature and a search in the global 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
This was an application for a group of variations 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to 
include a warning on psychogenic syncope based on 
the available safety data. The PL was proposed to be 
updated in accordance. In addition, the company 
took the opportunity to update the list of local 
safety database performed by the MAH, the CHMP 
recommended including a wording on psychogenic syncope 
to the product information of the MAH injectable vaccines. 
The literature review showed an incidence peak occurred 
around the age of 15 years, with females having more than 
twice the incidence of males. The syncope reports with 
secondary injuries were reported most frequently in 
children and adolescents.  
Given that psychogenic syncope is not a true side effect, it 
was not considered appropriate to include syncope as an 
undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC. However, as

vaccine) a trial was ran to assess the impact 
(Cervarix) and HAB vaccine (Twinrix Paediatric) with 
respect to immunogenicity, reactogenicity and 
safety, as compared to their separate administration, 
in healthy female subjects aged between 9 and 15 
years of age. 
The MAH also took the opportunity of this variation 
to comply with the latest version of the QRD 
template and to update the details of the local 
representatives in EU countries in the PL.

immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety, as compared to 
their separate administration, in healthy female subjects 
aged between 9 and 15 years of age. Results show that 
Twinrix paediatric may be administered concomitantly with 
Cervarix. Administration of Twinrix paediatric at the same 
time as Cervarix has shown no clinically relevant 
interference in the antibody response to the HPV and 
hepatitis A antigens. Anti-HBs geometric mean antibody 
titers were lower on co-administration, but the clinical 
significance of this observation is not known since the 
seroprotection rates remain unaffected. The proportion of 
subjects reaching anti-HBs ≥ 10mIU/ml was 98.3% for 
concomitant vaccination and 100% for Twinrix Paediatric 
alone.

studies: HAB-137 and HAB-157 which were 
conducted in children 1 to 11 years old and in 
adolescents 12 to 15 years old respectively. The MAH 
took further the opportunity of this variation to fulfill 
its commitment to remove any reference to 
thiomersal containing formulations under sections

typographical changes in the SmPC. 
immune persistence studies for Twinrix paediatric to update 
the product information with long-term persistence data up 
to 10 years post primary immunisation. 
The data from these studies suggest that administration of 
three doses of Twinrix Paediatric to healthy children aged 
1-15 years at the time of the first vaccination results in 
high rates of persistence of detectable antibody to HAV and 
HBs. All subjects retained ≥ 15 mIU/ml anti-HAV when 
followed for up to 5-10 years. The majority retained ≥ 10

recommended that vaccination should be delayed until after 
delivery unless there is an urgent need to protect the

Update of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 4.9 of the SPC to 
reflect the safety information obtained through a 
review of relevant clinical studies and post-marketing 
surveillance. These changes address the requests 
made by the CHMP following the assessment of the 
renewal of Twinrix Paediatric in June 2006 as well as 
PSUR 12 (covering the period from 20 September 
2005 to 19 September 2006). Section 4 of the PL has 
been updated accordingly. The MAH also took the 
opportunity to correct a mistake in section 4.2 of the 
SPC for the pre-filled syringes, to update the contact 
details for the local representatives of Romania and 
Slovakia in the PL and to make minor changes in the 
trials and of post-marketing surveillance data, the 
information on adverse events reported with Twinrix has 
been comprehensively updated as appropriate. Among 
these changes, 'hypoaesthesia' (loss of skin sensitivity), 
'lichen planus' (bumps on the skin) or 'muscle weakness' 
have been added to the list of undesirable effects. 
'Syncope' has been removed from the list of adverse events 
since it is attributed to the injection rather than to the 
vaccine itself, but an appropriate warning was added in 
section 4.4 of the SPC. The frequency of some adverse 
events has also been updated. The distinction has also 
been made clearer in the SPC between the adverse events 
reported during clinical trials and those reported through 
post-marketing surveillance. Ten cases of overdose have 
been reported during post-marketing surveillance. However

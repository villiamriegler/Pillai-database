2.  Grounds for the COMP opinions  
EU/3/10/794 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2010 was 
based on the following grounds: 
•  primary myelofibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be affecting 
approximately 0.3 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the application was made; 
• 
• 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to anaemia, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, and life-
threatening due to its complications resulting in a reduced life expectancy; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, sufficient justification has been provided that N-tert-butyl-3-[(5-methyl-2-{[4-(2-pyrrolidin-
1-ylethoxy)phenyl]amino}pyrimidin-4-yl)amino] benzenesulfonamide dihydrochloride monohydrate 
may be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. This is based on a clinically 
relevant advantage, on the grounds of a novel mechanism of action which might offer a

therapeutic alternative as supported by results in relevant preclinical models and in preliminary 
clinical data.  
EU/3/10/810 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2010 was 
based on the following grounds: 
•  post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to be affecting less than 0.15 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the 
application was made; 
• 
• 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in particular due to anaemia, 
splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, and reduced life expectancy; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
EU/3/10/811 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2010 was 
based on the following grounds: 
•  post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
be affecting less than 0.15 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the application 
was made; 
• 
• 
condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in particular due to anaemia, splenomegaly 
and hepatomegaly, and reduced life expectancy; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Myelofibrosis is a disease in which fibrous tissue forms in the bone marrow, interfering with normal 
blood cell production. This causes some immature blood cells to move from the bone marrow to other 
organs, such as the spleen and liver, which become enlarged. Symptoms of the disease include bone 
pain, tiredness, weakness, weight loss, fever and bleeding. 
Primary myelofibrosis is characterized by the presence of bone marrow fibrosis that cannot be 
attributed to another myeloid disorder. Secondary forms of myelofibrosis arise from essential 
thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera.  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 7/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the past the COMP designated primary and secondary forms of myelofibrosis separately, and this 
has changed to reflect the similarities in the clinical management of these three conditions. Since the 
sponsor obtained 3 independent orphan designations for primary and secondary forms of the condition, 
the sponsor presented 3 maintenance reports that jointly cover the proposed treatment indication.  
The proposed therapeutic indication “Treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult 
patients with primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential 
thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis who are JAK inhibitor naïve or have been treated with ruxolitinib.” 
falls within the scope of the 3 designated orphan conditions “post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis”, 
“Treatment of Primary Myelofibrosis” and “Treatment of Post-Essential Thrombocythaemia 
Myelofibrosis”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP (see 
EPAR). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Since the original orphan designations of fedratinib in 2010, one product was approved in the EU for 
the treatment of myelofibrosis: Jakavi (ruxolitinib). Improvement of survival compared with best 
available treatment (BAT) was demonstrated based on the 3-year follow up data from the COMFORT-II 
study (Cervantes, 2013). The Kaplan Meier estimated probability of survival at 144 weeks was 81% in 
the ruxolitinib arm and 61% in the BAT arm. However, in COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II, ruxolitinib 
discontinuation rates were approximately 50% by 3 years (Cervantes, 2013; Verstovsek, 2013). 
Due to the limited benefits of ruxolitinib re-challenge, it is not recommended as a standard second-line 
option in treatment guidelines and frequency of use in routine practice is unknown (Harrison, 2020). 
The European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines recommend that ruxolitinib should be 
discontinued in the event of progression and tapered gradually to prevent withdrawal syndrome, which 
has been associated with cytokine storm (Vannucchi, 2015a). Therefore, ruxolitinib it is not 
recommended as a standard second-line option and it is unclear how common this strategy is in 
practice. Patients who progress on ruxolitinib represent an unmet need. Survival in these patients has 
been reported to be 6 to 16 months (Kuykendall,2017; Kuykendall,2018; Newberry,2017; Schain, 
2019). 
Therefore, despite authorisation of ruxolitinib, all forms of myelofibrosis still remain chronically 
debilitating due to symptoms such as bone pain, tiredness, weakness, weight loss, fever and bleeding 
and life threatening with the estimated median survival of 69 months (Cervantes 2009). 
Number of people affected or at risk 
Based on literature and on an American patient registry the sponsor prepared a table of incidence and 
prevalence values found in Europe and worldwide. The data from MPN Registry (2008 and 2010) show 
that post-PVMF and post-ET MF account for a smaller proportion of the MF population.  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 8/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1.  Data from MPN Registry 
The literature discussed for the estimation of the prevalence of MF included Roaldsnes et al. 2016, 
Titmarsh et al.  2014, Moulard et al.  2014, HMRN Registry, Dupriez et al.  2016, Heinrich et al.  2014, 
Kaifie et al. 2016 Steinmetz et al. 2018, Kousoulakou et al. 2014 and Devos et al. 2015.  
The number of expected cases of post-PV MF and post-ET MF was derived by annualizing the 15-year 
cumulative incidence estimates of 6% for post-PV (Passamonte, 2008) and 15% for post-ET 
(Cervantes, 2002).  
Median survival estimates of PMF and post-PV MF are 5.8 years (Tefferi, 2007) and 5.7 years 
(Passamonti, 2008), respectively. No survival estimate of post-ET MF is available, so the MF estimate 
of 5.7 years (Pastor-Galán, 2019) is applied to patients with post-ET MF.  
The prevalence of each designated condition was calculated and was estimated at 0.3 in 10,000 for 
PMF, 0.1 in 10,000 for PPV-MF, and 0.1 in 10,000 for PET-MT. This was accepted based on the 
literature and methodology used.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) is currently the only treatment that is potentially curative 
and can induce long term remission in patients with myelofibrosis (Barbui, 2018; Vannucchi, 2017). In 
the EU, ruxolitinib is the only centrally approved product from the treatment of MF. Hydroxyurea and 
busulfan are approved on a national basis in a few countries (e.g., Italy, Ireland and Netherlands) and 
are used to control excessive myeloproliferation. 
The sponsor referred to both, ESMO and NCCN treatment guidelines (Vannucchi, 2015 and NCCN-MPN, 
2019) to describe currently recommended treatment algorithms for myelofibrosis.

Figure 1.  Treatment Algorithm for Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, and High-risk Myelofibrosis 
(Adapted from the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines) 
According to the sponsor there are no products authorised for patients who do not respond to 
treatment with ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib 1, 2, and 3-year discontinuation rates are 49%, 71%, and 86%, 
respectively, with the main reasons for discontinuation of ruxolitinib therapy being loss of therapeutic 
effect, lack of response, and drug induced cytopenias (Abdelrahman, 2015). More than half of the 
patients of the patients on ruxolitinib require dose reductions due to myelosuppression (Verstovsek, 
2017a). The myelosuppression is a great limitation specifically for patients with low baseline platelet 
counts (< 100 x 109/L). 
Significant benefit 
The initial sponsor for these designations received Protocol Assistance from the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in 2011 on the design for clinical Phase 3 study Fedratinib 
EFC12153 (JAKARTA). At that time, ruxolitinib was not yet approved in the EU, hence the 
demonstration of significant benefit of fedratinib over ruxolitinib was not discussed.  
There is no data directly comparing fedratinib to ruxolitinib. Following a systematic literature review, 
an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was performed to provide preliminary evidence to support the 
comparative efficacy between fedratinib and ruxolitinib. 
Significant benefit of fedratinib over SCT, splenectomy and splenic irradiation will not be discussed 
because these interventions occur in different patient settings than the intended use of fedratinib.  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 10/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The sponsor defines patients who are JAK inhibitor naïve as: 
• 
• 
Intermediate risk-1 patients with highly symptomatic spleen 
Intermediate risk-2 or high-risk patients ineligible to transplant 
The current standard of care for these patients is the only approved JAK inhibitor: ruxolitinib. 
The EFC12153 study of fedratinib was compared to the two registration studies of ruxolitinib 
COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II. Efficacy endpoints compared were ≥35% reduction in spleen volume 
reduction (SVR) and ≥50% reduction in TSS from baseline to the end of Week 24 (end of Cycle 6). 
Table 2.  SVR results (matching-adjust indirect comparison)

Table 3.  Total symptom score (TSS) results 
Among patients with PMF, approximately one-quarter has low platelet counts < 100 x 109/L as a 
consequence of their disease (Tefferi,2012) and therefore represents an important subgroup to be 
treated. As mentioned above, the two registration studies for ruxolitinib COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II 
did not enrol subjects with platelet count < 100 x 109/L while subjects with platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L 
were enrolled in the fedratinib study EFC12153. A side-by-side comparison was performed between the 
EFC12153 subgroup of subjects with platelet count between 50-100 x 109/L and the results from an 
interim analysis of a study (study 258) investigating ruxolitinib inpatients with myelofibrosis and low 
platelet counts (Talpaz 2013) to understand if fedratinib could be of significant benefit over ruxolitinib 
in this patient population. 
Several differences were identified in terms of study design, inclusion/exclusion criteria and baseline 
characteristics. There are indications to suggest that subjects in Study 258 are healthier than in 
ECF12153. However, comparison of baseline characteristics is limited by the small sample sizes. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 12/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 4.  Efficacy Results in Patients with Low Platelet Counts 50-100 x 109/L 
Despite several limitations, including small sample sizes, differences in study design and baseline 
characteristics, a greater proportion of fedratinib-treated subjects responded in terms of SVR 
compared to ruxolitinib-treated subjects (38.5% [CI: 12.0, 64.9] compared with 20% [CI: 7.6, 32.4]). 
For the TSS reduction outcome, the percentage of responders was similar in the fedratinib arm of 
ECF12153 and the ruxolitinib in Study 258. These results are proposed as relevant considering the 
unmet need in patients with low platelet counts. In addition, the risk of thrombocytopenia in these 
patients may be lower. As compared to fedratinib, a higher incidence of dose interruptions and dose 
reductions due to thrombocytopenia was observed for ruxolitinib (Table 5).  
The COMP agreed to treat these comparisons with caution but nevertheless concluded that fedratinib 
may bring clinically relevant advantage in low platelet count patients. 
As per the approved product information, the recommended starting dose of ruxolitinib is 15 mg twice 
daily for patients with a platelet count between 100 and 200 x 109/L and 20 mg twice daily for patients 
with a platelet count of > 200 x 109/L. The maximum starting dose for patients with platelet counts 
between 50 and 100 x 109/L is 5 mg twice daily and the dose should be titrated cautiously. Treatment 
should be discontinued for platelet counts less than 50 x 109/L or absolute neutrophil counts less than 
500/mm3(Novartis Europharm, 2019). 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 13/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the product was shown to be efficacious in patients previously treated with ruxolitinib. In 
this patient population, the ESMO clinical guideline refers to clinical trials and the NCCN guideline 
specifically refers to fedratinib which was approved in the USA in August 2019. Hydroxyurea and 
busulfan could still be considered satisfactory methods in this setting as they have a broad indication in 
MF in some EU countries (e.g. Italy, Ireland and Netherlands).   
There are no data comparing directly fedratinib to hydroxyurea or busulfan in patients previously 
treated with ruxolitinib. Studies in this setting utilized best available therapies (BAT) as comparator. 
HU or busulfan could be used in the BAT arm. In the two large studies PERSIST-2 (Mascarenhas, 2018) 
and SIMPLIFY-2 (Harrison, 2018), which investigated BAT in a patient population that had received 
prior JAK-inhibitor treatment, HU was used in approximately 20% of subjects whereas busulfan was 
not used at all. 
Although detailed responses of each therapies constituting the BAT arm are not published, the sponsor 
performed an indirect treatment comparison to BAT to demonstrate significant benefit of fedratinib 
over HU and busulfan in patients with MF previously treated with ruxolitinib. 
In summary, for the naïve (i.e., non-adjusted) ITC comparing fedratinib to BAT where the efficacy of 
BAT was informed by the PERSIST-2 study, fedratinib 400 mg led to a greater proportion of subjects 
with platelet count < 100 x 109/L achieving ≥ 35% reduction in SVR and ≥ 50% reduction in TSS 
compared to BAT. Specifically, fedratinib 400 mg had a 33.3% (95% CI 15.9, 50.8) greater proportion 
of subjects with ≥ 35% SVR compared with BAT and had a 21.2% (95%CI:0.7%,41.7%) greater 
proportion of subjects with ≥50% TSS reduction compared with BAT. After adjustment for baseline 
ECOG PS using the MAIC methodology, where the efficacy of BAT was informed by the SIMPLIFY-2 
study, fedratinib 400 mg had a 27.0% (95%CI:15.7,38.7) greater proportion of subjects with ≥ 35% 
SVR compared with BAT. After adjustment for ECOG PS and DIPSS, fedratinib 400 mg had a 17.0% 
(95% CI: 6.2, 28.2) greater proportion of subjects with ≥ 50% TSS reduction compared with BAT. For 
both endpoints, results were similar when a naïve (i.e., non-adjusted) comparison was performed and 
when an STC with the same adjustment (adjustment for ECOG PS) was performed. 
Taken together, the sponsor provided an indirect comparative analysis of the standard of care vs. 
fedratinib in treatment naïve and ruxolitinib refractory populations. In treatment naïve population a 
clinically relevant advantage of improved efficacy was proposed in patients with low platelet counts.  
In refractory population, the sponsor provided literature and an indirect comparison, which indicate 
that the product performed better, especially in spleen volume reductions, compared to the best 
standard of care. The sponsor did not present any data demonstrating the response that could be seen 
with the use of busulfan. However, the fact that this product was not used in the published studies with 
the BAT may indicate that the efficacy is not expected to be of value compared to other available 
treatment options. Therefore, taken together, the claims of significant benefit of fedratinib in the 
ruxolitinib pre-treated patients was accepted.

4.  COMP position adopted on 16 December 2020 
EU/3/10/794 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication includes the orphan condition of the designated Orphan 
Medicinal Product. The therapeutic indication is covered entirely by this and two additional orphan 
designations (EU/3/10/810 and EU/3/10/811), which are covered by separate opinion documents; 
the prevalence of primary myelofibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated 
to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.3 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening with a median survival of 5.75 years, and chronically debilitating 
due to anaemia, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Inrebic may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition as defined in the granted therapeutic indication still holds. The 
sponsor presented data from the clinical trial in patients who were relapsed and refractory to 
ruxolitinib showing clinically meaningful reductions in spleen volume reductions and total symptom 
score. Moreover, patients with low platelet counts who were treatment naïve, achieved improved 
spleen volume reductions as compared to patients treated with ruxolitinib.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Inrebic, N-tert-butyl-3-[(5-
methyl-2-{[4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl]amino}pyrimidin-4-yl)amino] benzenesulfonamide 
dihydrochloride monohydrate, fedratinib for treatment of primary myelofibrosis (EU/3/10/794) is not 
removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products. 
EU/3/10/810 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication includes the orphan condition of the designated Orphan 
Medicinal Product. The therapeutic indication is covered entirely by this and two additional orphan

affected by the orphan condition as defined in the granted therapeutic indication still holds. The 
sponsor presented data from the clinical trial in patients who were relapsed and refractory to 
ruxolitinib showing clinically meaningful reductions in spleen volume reductions and total symptom 
score. Moreover, patients with low platelet counts who were treatment naïve, achieved improved 
spleen volume reductions as compared to patients treated with ruxolitinib. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Inrebic, N-tert-butyl-3-[(5-
methyl-2-{[4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl]amino}pyrimidin-4-yl)amino] benzenesulfonamide 
dihydrochloride monohydrate, fedratinib for treatment of post-essential thrombocythaemia 
myelofibrosis (EU/3/10/810) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal 
Products. 
EU/3/10/811 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication includes the orphan condition of the designated Orphan 
Medicinal Product. The therapeutic indication is covered entirely by this and two additional orphan 
designations (EU/3/10/794 and EU/3/10/810), which are covered by separate opinion documents; 
the prevalence of post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.1 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening with a median survival of 5.75 years, and chronically debilitating 
due to anaemia, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Inrebic may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition as defined in the granted therapeutic indication still holds. The

Signal evaluation of influenza-like illness using the MAH’s 
the safety information with regards to the adverse 
reaction “Influenza-like illness” with a frequency of 
Uncommon following the assessment of influenza-
like illness with evolocumab in both the clinical 
database and postmarketing database. The Package 
Leaflet Section 4 was updated accordingly. In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to implement changes to the 
package leaflet Section 2 subsequent to the revised 
Annex to the EC guideline on excipients in the 
labelling (EMA/CHMP/302620/2017) to update the 
wording for sodium.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to
clinical trial database was conducted. Furthermore, a 
search of the MAH’s Global Safety Database was also 
performed to identify all cases with the preferred terms 
influenza and influenza-like illness. Influenza-like illness 
manifests as similar symptoms to influenza and may be 
due to a non-influenza virus (eg, rhinovirus, adenovirus) or 
could be associated with the use of medications. The MAH 
received 3122 post marketing events of influenza and 
influenza-like illness, of which 165 events were reported as 
serious. Of the 165 serious events, 24 cases reported a 
positive re-challenge that was suggestive of a possible 
causal drug-event association. Of the 24 cases, 19 reported 
influenza-like-illness and 5 reported influenza. All were 
classified as serious events. The 19 cases of influenza-like-
illness show a probable association with the use of 
evolocumab due to e.g. re-challenge and plausible time to 
onset. Based on the 19 post marketing cases  which 
reported influenza-like illness with a probable causality the 
proposal of the MAH to include influenza-like-illness as an 
adverse event with frequency ‘uncommon’ in section 4.8 
was accepted.

The applicant has submitted a Type II variation to the 
B.II.g.2 - Introduction of a post approval change 
management protocol related to the finished product
marketing authorization for Repatha (evolocumab) to gain 
approval of a Post Approval Change Management Protocol 
(PACMP) for the introduction of Building PM3 in Amgen 
Technology Ireland (ADL) Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin, 
Ireland (hereafter referred to as ADL-PM3) as an additional 
(alternative), drug product manufacturing site for the 
formulation and aseptic filling of Repatha (evolocumab) 
syringes. 
The currently licensed Amgen drug product manufacturing 
facilities are Amgen Manufacturing Limited, Building 1 
(JU001, also known as AML-1) and Building 14 (JU014, also 
known as AML-14), in Juncos, Puerto Rico. Addition of ADL-
PM3 is intended to increase the overall capacity and 
prevent points of failure in supply by diversifying 
manufacturing and product storage locations. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) provided a 
PACMP for the formulation and aseptic filling of Repatha 
syringes. The PACMP is considered acceptable. It contains 
an acceptable description of the change. The section on risk 
assessment does not cover the risk of oxidation, although 
Page 13/16
this risk is sufficiently addressed under characterisation and 
in the appendix. For the remaining aspects, the risk 
assessment was sufficient. In addition, the PACMP 
describes the approaches which the MAH intends to apply 
for process comparison - including comparison of the 
facilities, the in process control strategy and process 
validation strategy – and product comparability – including 
release testing, characterisation and stability (accelerated 
conditions). 
In addition, post-change drug product lots will be put on 
stability per the established annual stability protocol and 
stored under recommended storage conditions (RSC) of 
2°C to 8°C. The stability results at RSC to the 3 month 
time point will be submitted to the Agency in the Type IB 
variation to implement the change. The RSC studies will 
continue through expiry per the existing stability 
commitments (3.2.P.8.2, Post-approval Stability Protocol 
and Stability Commitment [140 mg/mL PFS]).
One question was asked regarding comparability criteria 
and was adequately resolved by the MAH.  Therefore the 
PACMP can be approved.
The benefit-risk balance of Repatha in the approved 
indication remains positive.

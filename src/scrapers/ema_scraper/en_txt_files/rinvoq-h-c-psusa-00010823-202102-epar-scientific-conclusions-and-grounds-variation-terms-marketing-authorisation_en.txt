Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for upadacitinib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on diverticulitis from clinical trial and spontaneous reports including cases 
with a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of 
action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between upadacitinib and diverticulitis is established. 
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing upadacitinib should be 
amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for upadacitinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing upadacitinib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

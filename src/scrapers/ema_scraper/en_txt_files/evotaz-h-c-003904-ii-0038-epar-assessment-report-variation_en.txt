2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
The MAH submitted a Type II variation to support the extension of indication to include the use of Evotaz 
(atazanavir (sulphate)/cobicistat) in combination with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV-
1 infection in paediatric patients aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years, weighing ≥ 35 kg. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Atazanavir (ATV) is an azapeptide protease inhibitor (PI) of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-
1). The compound selectively inhibits processing of viral proteins in HIV-infected cells, thereby preventing 
the formation of mature virions and infection of other cells. ATV capsules (100, 150, 200 and 300 mg) 
and oral powder (50 mg), co-administered with low-dose ritonavir (RTV) are indicated in the European 
Union (EU), United States (US), and many countries worldwide for the treatment HIV-1 infection in adults 
and paediatric patients weighing at least 5 kg. In the US, ATV (400 mg QD) may also be administered 
without RTV in adults and paediatric patients who cannot tolerate RTV. 
Cobicistat (COBI) is an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 (CYP)3A enzymes and was developed for use as a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294308/2021 
Page 6/51 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer of PIs. COBI is a structural analogue of RTV and has no antiretroviral 
activity. In vitro, it has been shown to be a more specific mechanism based CYP3A inhibitor than RTV. 
The COBI 150 mg film-coated tablet (TYBOST) is available as a single agent in the US, EU, Canada, and 
Australia. 
Evotaz [atazanavir/cobicistat (ATV/COBI)] is a fixed-dose combination (FDC) oral immediate-release film-
coated tablet. The tablet contains 300 mg ATV and 150 mg COBI. It is indicated in the US, EU, and other 
countries for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
A discussion on Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) is however provided. 
2.2.1.  Environmental Risk Assessment 
The present variation (type II) aims to modify the approved therapeutic indication for this medicinal 
product to include new target population: adolescents aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years, weighing at least 35 kg, 
for treatment of HIV-1. Consequently, the risk assessment to environmental compartments should be 
performed: the PEC value for both active substances atazanavir and cobicistat (based on prevalence data) 
should be calculated for the new population group and then summed to the previous PEC to reach the 
total PEC. This paediatric patient population (adolescents aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years, weighing at least 35 
kg) was already considered in a previous EVOTAZ procedure (EMEA/H/C/003904/IB/002), where both 
atazanavir and cobicistat were shown not to present a risk to environment compartments.  
Furthermore, the HIV cases are found overwhelmingly among adults. For example, in 2019, the adult 
(ages 15–49 years) HIV prevalence in Estonia was 0.9%.  When adding in the paediatric population (ages 
0–14 years), however, the HIV prevalence of the total population was 0.55% indicating that the 
prevalence actually decreases when the paediatric population is added. Additionally, there is limited 
availability of age-specific breakdowns in HIV prevalence. 
Overall, considerations above were considered acceptable and satisfactory by the CHMP, thus no need to 
update the ERA. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, this application of extension of indication to adolescents aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years, weighing 
at least 35 kg for this medicinal product in the treatment of HIV-1, does not lead to a significant increase 
in environmental exposure. Therefore, Evotaz (atazanavir/cobicistat) is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment.

Page 8/51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A minimum of 79 subjects are planned to be enrolled to evaluate the steady state PK and confirm the 
dose of ATV/co and DRV/co. 
Part B: 
A minimum of 21 additional subjects are planned to be enrolled in Part B to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of the ATV/co or DRV/co regimen. 
Test Product, Dose, Mode of Administration: 
Cohort 1 Part A: COBI 150 mg (administered as 75 mg x 2 tablets or 150 mg x 1 tablet) administered 
orally once-daily with food, in combination with DRV or ATV and a BR 
Number of Subjects (Planned and Analysed): 
Planned: 100 subjects  
Analysed (by analysis set): For Interim Analysis 1, 22 subjects in Cohort 1 Part A received study drug. 
Numbers of subjects in the Safety, Full, PK, and Intensive PK Analysis Sets are shown for Cohort 1 Part A.

Full Analysis Set (FAS): 22 
PK Analysis Set: 22 
Intensive PK Analysis Set for COBI: 22 
Intensive PK Analysis Set for ATV: 14 
Intensive PK Analysis Set for DRV: 8 
Pharmacokinetics:  
An intensive PK evaluation was performed at Day -1 (for ATV or DRV), and Day 10 (for ATV or DRV and 
COBI) for subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 Part A. Intensive PK blood samples were collected at pre-dose and 
at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 12 hours post-dose on Day -1 (for ATV or DRV) and on Day 10 (for ATV or DRV 
and COBI). 
The primary PK endpoint was the PK parameter of AUCtau for ATV and DRV at Day 10. The secondary PK 
endpoints were the PK parameters of Ctau, Cmax, and CL/F for ATV and DRV, and AUCtau, Ctau, Cmax, CL/F, 
and Vz/F for COBI at Day 10.  
Sparse trough PK samples were collected at baseline (pre-dose) and 20 to 28 hours post-dose at Weeks 
12, 24, and 48 for Cohort 1 Part A subjects. 
Bioanalytical Methods: 
Azatanavir 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294308/2021 
Page 9/51 
 
 
 
 
 
Determination of Azatanavir in Human Plasma was made by a validated LC-MS/MS method. This method 
was linear between 10 ng/mL and 5000 ng/mL. Dilution Integrity was determined with a concentration of 
20000 ng/mL diluted 10-fold. Analysis of samples began on 13 Apr 2015 (date of first extraction) and 
concluded on 30 Jan 2017 (date of last injection). A total of 965 days transpired between the first sample 
collection date and the last extraction date; however, no more than 721 days transpired between any 
individual sample collection date and its corresponding extraction date. All study samples were analysed 
within the established long-term stability of 721 days at -70°C. The %CV of the QCs for atazanavir at 30, 
800, and 4000 ng/mL ranged from 4.5% to 19.0% while %RE ranged from -2.8% to 6.5%. A total of 18 
samples were re-assayed due to concentrations above the quantifiable limit. 
Cobicistat 
Determination of Cobicistat in Human Plasma was made by a validated LC-MS/MS method. This method 
was linear between 5 ng/mL and 2500 ng/mL. Dilution Integrity was determined with a concentration of 
4000 ng/mL diluted 20-fold. Analysis of samples began on 29 Apr 2015 (date of first extraction) and 
concluded on 22 Feb 2017 (date of last injection). A total of 974 days transpired between the first sample 
collection date and the last extraction date. All study samples were analysed within the established long-
term stability of 1297 days at -60°C to -80°C. The %CV of the QCs for GS-9350 at 15, 100, 1000, and 
2000 ng/mL ranged from 5.2% to 113.0% while %RE ranged from -5.8% to 74.0%. The large %CV and 
%RE values are attributed to outliers for QC 15 and QC 100 in Run 11 that appear to have been 
inadvertently switched. Three samples were re-assayed because they were impacted by carryover and 
one sample was re-assayed due to a concentration above the quantifiable limit. 
Statistical Methods: 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for ATV boosted by ritonavir (RTV, r) on Day -1 and by COBI on Day 10, 
respectively, were summarized for all subjects in the Intensive PK Analysis Set by application of a 
nonlinear model using standard noncompartmental methods (WinNonlin software). Pharmacokinetic 
parameters for COBI were summarized similarly. Plasma concentrations for each analyte (Day -1 for ATV 
and Day 10 for ATV and COBI) were listed for all subjects and summarized by nominal time point for 
subjects in the Intensive PK Analysis Set. 
To determine whether the respective exposure of ATV boosted by the adult dose of COBI (150 mg) in 
adolescents were similar to those in adults, statistical comparisons were performed to compare PK data 
from the current study with historical data in HIV-1 infected adults. 
The precision around estimation of CL/F of ATV, which was examined to confirm appropriateness of the 
dose per protocol, was assessed by comparing the 95% CIs of the geometric mean estimates of each to 
the FDA-specified boundary of 60% to 140%. The precision around estimation of CL/F and Vz/F for COBI 
was also assessed. 
A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was fitted to the natural logarithmic transformed values 
of AUCtau (as the primary parameter) and Cmax and Ctau (as the secondary parameters, if available) for 
ATV with treatment group as a fixed effect. The treatment groups were defined as the test treatment 
(adolescents in this study) and reference treatment (adults from the historical studies). 
Exposure equivalency of COBI-boosted ATV versus RTV-boosted ATV was also evaluated. An ANOVA 
model was fitted to the natural logarithmic transformed values of AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau for ATV with 
treatment group as a fixed effect. The treatment groups were defined as the test treatment (PI boosted 
by COBI) and reference treatment (PI boosted by RTV). The geometric least-squares mean (GLSM) of 
each treatment group, and the mean ratio (test/reference) and corresponding 90% CI for each PK 
parameter of the analytes was reported. For each analyte, 90% CIs for the ratio of the GLSMs of test 
(adolescents in this study) and reference (adults from historical studies) treatments were calculated for 
AUCtau, Ctau, and Cmax, consistent with the 2 one-sided tests each performed at an alpha level of 0.05. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294308/2021 
Page 10/51 
 
 
 
 
Equivalency in PK would be concluded if the 90% CI were within the equivalence boundaries 70% to 
143%. 
Subject Disposition and Demographics:  
Of the 28 screened subjects for Cohort 1 Part A, 22 were enrolled into the study and received at least 1 
dose of study drug. Most subjects (63.6%) were male. Median age (range) was 14 (12 to 17) years. 
Overall, 36.4% of subjects were Asian and 31.8% of subjects were white, and 68.2% were not Hispanic 
or Latino. Median (Q1, Q3) baseline body weight and body weight Z-score were 52.7 (46.5, 63.3) kg and 
-0.10 (-0.58, 0.95), respectively; median (Q1, Q3) baseline height and height Z-score were 159.0 
(152.0, 162.5) cm and -0.67 (-1.34, -0.38), respectively. Median (Q1, Q3) baseline body mass index 
(BMI) was 21.2 (18.8, 25.7) kg/m2, and median (Q1, Q3) body surface area (BSA) was 1.53 (1.41, 1.71) 
m2. 
Pharmacokinetics Results: 
In the intensive PK analysis, the steady-state PK of ATV, DRV, and COBI were evaluated in adolescents 
12 to < 18 years of age (N = 14 for ATV, N = 8 for DRV) administered adult-strength COBI 150 mg with 
approved doses of ATV or DRV. While the protocol allowed enrolment of adolescents 12 to < 18 years, 
weighing ≥ 25 kg, only 1 subject in the COBI-boosted ATV group was < 35 kg. As such, the data 
presented support the use of COBI 150 mg with ATV or DRV in adolescents weighing ≥ 35 kg. The 
following figures reflect the mean plasma profiles following the coadministration of ATV + COBI and 
support the use of COBI 150 mg with ATV in adolescents weighing ≥ 35 kg.

For ATV, AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau were 29%, 24% and 71% higher, respectively, in adolescents receiving 
COBI-boosted ATV compared to those observed in adults. With respect to exposures of ATV boosted by 
COBI compared to those boosted by RTV in these same adolescents, AUCtau, and Cmax were similar and 
Ctau was 16% lower with COBI relative to RTV. These differences were considered as without clinical 
concern, as they were similar to those observed following treatment with RTV-boosted ATV, which is 
approved for use in this population.

From the interim analysis of Study GS-US-216-0128, it is concluded that no clinically relevant differences 
in ATV exposures with COBI 150 mg were observed in adolescents compared with adults from the Phase 
3 populations, and exposures of COBI were within the safe and efficacious ranges associated with robust 
pharmacokinetic boosting in other products programs.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Pharmacokinetics of Atazanavir in HIV-1 infected adolescents 
Plasma exposures of ATV in adolescents weighing ≥ 35 kg receiving ATV/co were compared to intensive 
PK data from adult subjects receiving ATV/co in the Phase 2 and 3 Studies GS-US-216-0105 and GS-US-
216-0114 (N = 30). All subjects received COBI 150 mg. The geometric least square mean (GLSM) ratio 
and associated 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for ATV AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau were outside the 70% to 
143% boundary and were 29%, 24%, and 71% higher, respectively, in adolescents receiving ATV/co 
compared to those observed in adults. With respect to exposures of ATV boosted by COBI compared to 
those boosted by RTV in these same adolescents, AUCtau, and Cmax were similar and Ctau was 16% lower 
with COBI relative to RTV.  
Statistical Comparisons of Atazanavir Plasma PK Parameter Estimates Between Adolescents and Adults, 
Cohort 1 Part A (Intensive PK Analysis Set for ATV) are presented in the table below. 
Statistical Comparisons of Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimates Between COBI-boosted ATV and RTV-
boosted ATV in Adolescents, Cohort 1 Part A (Intensive PK Analysis Set for ATV) are presented in the 
table below. 
The differences between ATV/co treated adolescents and adults were not considered clinically relevant as 
ATV exposures in adolescents were within the safe and efficacious range of exposures observed 
historically in adults and paediatric patients treated with ATV/r, which is approved for use in this 
population (steady-state geometric mean of ATV AUCtau in paediatric subgroups 5 to < 10 kg to ≥ 35 kg 
ranged from 32503 to 55687 ng*h/mL.

The lower ATV Ctau in adolescents with COBI relative to with RTV was not considered clinically important 
as mean ATV Ctau was higher compared to the ATV/co-treated adult historical control group and was > 
100-fold above the protein-adjusted EC50 (ie, half maximal effective concentration) against wild-type 
HIV-1 virus (15 ng/mL) (Boffito 2011). Atazanavir AUC and Ctau boosted with COBI or RTV in adolescents 
in this study were higher than reported previously with ATV/r in paediatric patients ≥ 35 kg (steady-state 
geometric mean of AUC and Cmin were 37643 h•ng/mL and 653 ng/mL, respectively. This was not 
considered clinically concern as these ATV exposures in adolescents with COBI or with RTV were within 
the safe and efficacious range of exposures observed historically in adults and paediatric patients, as 
noted above. 
Pharmacokinetics of Cobicistat in HIV-1 infected adolescents 
Plasma exposures of COBI in adolescents receiving ATV/co were compared to intensive PK data from 
subjects receiving ATV/co in the Phase 2 and 3 Studies GS-US-216-0105 and GS-US-216-0114 (N = 30).  
In adolescents receiving ATV/co, COBI AUCtau and Ctau were 37% and 181% higher, respectively, relative 
to adults (next Table ). The Cmax of COBI was similar in adolescents and adults; the %GLSM ratios and 
associated 90% CI were within 70% to 143%. 
Statistical Comparisons of Cobicistat Plasma PK Parameter Estimates Between Paediatric Subjects (12 to 
< 18 years) and Adults Following Administration of COBI-boosted ATV, Cohort 1 Part A (Intensive PK 
Analysis Set for COBI) are presented in the table below. 
The higher COBI exposures (AUCtau and Ctau) in adolescents relative to adults were not considered 
clinically relevant as they were within the range of exposures associated with robust pharmacokinetic 
boosting and safety established in the Tybost, Genvoya, and Stribild programs in adult and paediatric HIV 
patients.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The following topic describes the mechanism of action and primary pharmacology characteristics of 
atazanavir and cobicistat, as stated in the EPAR of the isolated active substances.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294308/2021 
Page 18/51 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Atazanavir 
Atazanavir (ATV) is a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor. It is an azapeptide that 
blocks the processing of viral gag-pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of 
mature virions.  
Cobicistat 
Tybost, cobicistat, COBI has been shown to inhibit the activity of human CYP3A enzymes (IC50 values 
0.03 to 0.15 μM) and enzyme kinetic studies have demonstrated that it is an efficient inactivator of 
human CYP3A activity. The potency of the observed inhibition and inactivation was comparable to that 
observed with RTV and hence, the applicant has identified COBI as a mechanism-based inhibitor. The 
Applicant has provided evidence that the inhibition of CYP3A is time, NADPH and concentration 
dependent, which suggests that cobicistat is capable of mechanism-based inhibition. However, the 
Applicant states that the precise molecular mechanism of inhibition is not completely understood and that 
overall, the mechanism may be mixed.  
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Atazanavir 
Inhibition of HIV protease by ATV 
Atazanavir inhibited the cleavage activity of HIV-RF protease with a Ki of 0.75 nM, which is comparable to 
the inhibitory activity of other protease inhibitors. Indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir gave Ki 
values of 0.73 nM, 1.05 nM, 0.39 nM, and 1.01 nM, respectively, in this assay. 
Atazanavir inhibited the cleavage of gag (p55) by HIV protease with an IC50 of 47 nM. 
The cytotoxic concentration of ATV is 6500-23000 fold higher than IC and revealed a selective index 
comparable to other approved HIV protease inhibitor. 
Antiviral activity of ATV in vitro 
Experiments with wild type HIV laboratory strains have been performed in the absence and in the 
presence of 40 % of human serum to assess the antiviral activity of atazanavir. 
In the absence of serum, comparative studies revealed that atazanavir (with an EC50 value of 2 – 5 nM) 
is 2- to 20-fold more active than other protease inhibitors including indinavir (IDV), nelfinavir (NFV), 
ritonavir (RTV), saquinavir (SQV), and amprenavir (APV). The activity of atazanavir (EC50 values) against 
seven subtypes of group M and against a group O isolate varied by more than 10-fold. Activity against 
other subtypes of HIV-1 or against HIV-2 has not been explored. 
In 40% human serum the atazanavir EC50 value increased from 1.5 nM to 7.8 nM (5-fold), similar to the 
other protease inhibitors but significantly less than nelfinavir (≥ 17-fold). The resulting atazanavir EC50 
value is 3-to 19-fold lower than the EC50 of each of the approved protease inhibitors. Lopinavir/ritonavir 
was not tested. In 50% human serum the antiviral activity of lopinavir against HIV IIB in MT4 cells was 
102+44 nM. 
The two metabolites of ATV identified in the systemic circulation following administration of atazanavir to 
humans have no antiviral activity.

Cobicistat 
CYP3A inhibition studies vs. RTV in human hepatic microsomes included established markers for activities 
of CYP3A enzymes as well as ATV, EVG and telaprevir. COBI was shown to be a strong inhibitor of all 
tested human hepatic microsomal CYP3A activities. The IC50 values for COBI and RTV were closely 
comparable. Kinetic parameters for COBI (kinact = 0.47 min-1, KI = 1.1 μM) were comparable to those 
of RTV (kinact = 0.23 min−1, KI = 0.26 μM).  
The COBI IC50 for CYP2B6 was comparable with that for RTV while that for CYP2D6 was higher than for 
RTV.  
Study in support of proposed variation 
In support of the proposed variation, the MAH has provided with results from study GS-US-216-0128, a 
Phase 2/3, open label, multicenter, multicohort, two-part study composed of several cohorts with the 
primary objective of evaluation of PK and confirmation of the dose of ATV + COBI or DRV + COBI 
administered with a BR through 48 weeks, plus the evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
ATV + COBI or DRV + COBI administered with a BR through 48 weeks. 
The study population was HIV-1 infected, treatment-experienced (2 NTRIs and either ATV + RTV or DRV + 
RTV),  virologically  suppressed  (HIV-1  RNA  <  50  copies/mL)  paediatric  subjects  aged  3  months  to  <  18 
years and subjects were divided into the following age cohorts: 
Cohort 1 - 12 to < 18 years 
Cohort 2 - 6 to < 12 years 
Cohort 3 - 3 to < 6 years 
Cohort 4 - 3 months to < 3 years

Clinical Virology data for Study GS-US-216-0128; ATV + COBI 
Regarding  clinical  virology  data  for  Study  GS-US-216-0128,  an  interim  analysis  was  performed,  with 
resistance analyses being conducted on all subjects according to the Resistance Analysis Population (RAP), 
which was comprised of subjects who met prespecified virologic failure (VF) criteria and  had HIV-1 RNA 
≥ 400 copies/mL at the confirmation visit.  
Pretreatment  Virology  Data  was  supported  on  HIV-1  historical  genotypes  with  protease  and  reverse 
transcriptase  data  that  were  available  for  13  of  14  subjects  (92.9%)  in  Cohort  1  Part  A.  Pretreatment 
primary  NNRTI  associated  resistance  was  observed  in  2  of  the  13  subjects,  consisting  of  the  K103N 
substitution in both subjects. Pretreatment primary NRTI-associated resistance substitutions were observed 
in  6  of  the  13  subjects,  consisting  of  M41L  (3  subjects),  D67N  (2  subjects),  K70R  (2  subjects),  L74I  (1 
subject), M184V (4 subjects), L210W  (1 subject),  T215F/Y (4 subjects), and K219E/Q (2 subjects). The 
HIV-1  subtype  was  determined  for  9  of  13  subjects  (69.0%)  with  pretreatment  genotypic  data.  Among 
these 9 subjects, 7 had subtype B and 2 had subtype AE.

Virology Analyses in Subjects Experiencing Virologic Failure through Week 48 and Included in the Resistance 
Analysis Population are described as followed. 
Of  the  14  subjects  in  Cohort  1  Part  A,  3  subjects  (21.4%)  receiving  ATV  +  COBI  met  the  VF  and  RAP 
inclusion  criteria.  Postbaseline  genotypic  and  phenotypic  data  were  obtained  for  1 subject  who  had 
confirmed VF at the Week 24 retest visit with no relevant new resistance substitutions identified in PR or 
RT, and the subject subsequently re-suppressed to HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 while continuing 
study drugs. 
Postbaseline  data  were  not  available  for  the  2  remaining  subjects  in  the  RAP,  who  both  experienced 
confirmed VF at Week 48, but had assay failures due to low viral load (HIV-1 RNA was 771 copies/mL) or 
insufficient  sample  volume  for  testing.  The  subject  with  771 copies/mL  of  HIV-1  RNA  at  confirmed  VF 
subsequently  re-suppressed  at  the  Week  48  retest  visit  and  had  HIV-1  RNA  <  50  copies/mL  by  the  US 
FDA-defined snapshot algorithm. The other subject remained viremic at their Week 48 retest visit (HIV-1 
RNA  ≥  50  copies/mL  by  snapshot  analysis).  Transient  viremia  and  the  absence  of  treatment-emergent 
resistance after virologic failure suggest nonadherence to study drugs. 
Pharmacodynamic/Efficacy Endpoints 
Based on efficacy analyses at Week 24 and Week 48 using the USFDA defined snapshot algorithm, the rates 
of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) were 64.3% at Week 24 and 92.9% at Week 48 for 
ATV  +  COBI,  and  high  rates  of  virologic  suppression  were  maintained  beyond  Week 48.  There  were  no 
clinically relevant changes in CD4 cell counts and CD4%. No subjects developed treatment-emergent drug 
resistance substitutions in protease or reverse transcriptase. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
In this study, no PK/PD modelling was performed. A detailed PK analysis was performed in this study and 
is discussed in more detailed in the Pharmacokinetics section. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
Based on efficacy analyses at Week 24 and Week 48 using the USFDA defined snapshot algorithm, the 
rates of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) were 64.3% at Week 24 and 92.9% at Week 
48 for ATV + COBI, and high rates of virologic suppression were maintained beyond Week 48. There were 
no clinically relevant changes in CD4 cell counts and CD4%. No subjects developed treatment-emergent 
drug resistance substitutions in protease or reverse transcriptase. 
For those who received ATV + COBI the Resistance Analysis Population contained 3 subjects in Cohort 1 
Part A who experienced protocol-defined virologic failure during the first 48 weeks of the study. Post-
baseline genotypic and phenotypic data were available for 1 subject and showed no resistance in protease 
or reverse transcriptase. The other 2 subjects had no postbaseline data due to assay failure. Transient 
viremia in the absence of treatment-emergent resistance after virologic failure suggests intermittent 
nonadherence to daily study drug dosing or administration. 
No clinically relevant differences in ATV exposures with COBI 150 mg were observed in HIV-1-infected, 
virologically suppressed paediatric subjects weighing ≥ 35 kg compared with either treatment-naïve or 
treatment-experienced adults from the Phase 3 study populations. Likewise, the exposures of COBI were 
within the safe and efficacious ranges and were associated with robust pharmacokinetic boosting, as 
observed in other cobicistat-containing programs. In addition, results from PK studies have shown that 
the exposure of ATV 300 mg with COBI 150 mg is consistent with exposure of ATV 300 mg when

coadministered with RTV 100 mg. As such, the PK, efficacy, safety, and acceptability/palatability data 
support the use of COBI 150 mg-boosted ATV 300 mg, including the bioequivalent fixed-dose product 
Evotaz, in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients weighing ≥ 35 kg. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical Study GS-US-216-0128 is an ongoing study wherethe PK of the combination of Cobicistat-boosted 
Atazanavir (ATV/co) or Cobicistat-boosted Darunavir were studied. In this study, the overall age range 
includes subjects from 3 months to < 18 years of age, who are enrolled sequentially in age-descending 
cohorts, divided into the age and weight cohorts. The current cohort considers only HIV-1 infected 
adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older. Although no weight limitations were considered, only one 
subject had less than 35kg and, so, this application is concerning only subjects weighing at least 35 kg. 
Therefore, the CHMP considers this application applicable only to subjects weighing at least 35 kg. 
This study allowed to directly compare DRV and ATV boosted by Ritonavir (day -1) and by Cobicistat (Day 
10) and indirectly with historical data on the adult population. A rich sampling was collected on days -1 
and 10 of the trial. Sparse sampling was also performed on latter days. For the above sample size 
computations, inter-subject standard deviations of 0.38 h•ng/mL for ATV AUCtau (based on 64 adult 
subjects in Studies GS-US-216-0110, GS-US-216-0114, and GS-US-216-0105 combined) and of 0.3 
h•ng/mL for DRV AUCtau (based on population PK data from 298 adult subjects in Study GS-US-216-
0130), respectively, were used in the computation. It was assumed that equivalent assessments were to 
be conducted using two 1-sided t-tests each at 0.05 alpha levels, and equivalence boundaries of 70% to 
143% were applied. Bioanalysis on DRV, ATV and COBI was made by HPLC-MSMS validated methods. The 
PK analysis was made by standard non-compartmental methods using WinNonlin. Statistical analysis is 
also based on standard comparisons by ways of ANOVA.  
Considering the several plots of PK exposure parameters vs age for ATV and COBI, CHMP agreed that age 
between 12 and 18 years did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the exposure of both drugs. This 
is consistent with historical paediatric data of ATV with RTV, and of COBI within the fixed-dosed 
combination Genvoya and Stribild. 
Based on the several plots of the PK exposure parameters vs weight for ATV and COBI, a trend with 
exposure and body weight was observed for all analytes. This trend follows historical paediatric data of 
ATV with RTV, and of COBI within Genvoya and Stribild. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no dose 
adjustment is considered needed as the exposures of ATV and COBI in adolescents are within the range 
of adult exposures associated with safety and efficacy. 
The CHMP committee observed a higher ATV exposure of the paediatric population when compared with 
the adult historical data. However, in the day -1 to Day 10 comparison (ATV/r vs ATC/co), similarity was 
observed in AUCtau and Cmax. A slightly 16% lower Ctau was observed in adolescents with COBI relative to 
with RTV. This is, however, above the historical data on adults. 
In adolescents receiving ATV/co or DRV/co, COBI exposure (AUCtau and Ctau) were higher relative to 
adults. The Cmax of COBI was similar in adolescents and adults in both treatment arms. This is similar to 
what was observed in children taking GENVOYA® (with even higher GLSM AUCtau, but slightly lower GLSM 
Ctau). The range of observed values is within the range of safety exposures associated with other robust 
pharmacokinetic COBI containing medicines programs in adult and paediatric HIV patient. Therefore, the 
CHMP committee agreed that this does not raise a clinical concern.

Adolescents aged 12 to <18 and weighing ≥ 25 kg enrolled in Cohort 1 Part A of this study had intensive 
PK samples collected over 12 hours post-dose on Day 10. Plasma concentrations of COBI at pre-dose (0 
hours) on day 10 were used as a surrogate for the concentrations at 24 hours (end of the dosing interval) 
for the purposes of estimating AUCtau and Ctau. On further review of COBI PK in presence of ATV (ATV/co) 
in 14 adolescent subjects, two subjects  were identified as having a substantially prolonged COBI T1/2 of 
27.37 and 30.29 hours with acceptable safety profile, respectively, as compared to the established COBI 
T1/2 of 4-5 hours  
Additionally, in these two subjects, COBI concentrations at 24-hours post-dose were approximately 1.8-
fold higher than the 12-hour concentrations  
These results suggest that these pre-dose samples were likely collected in error, and do not represent 
actual trough concentrations in these two subjects. Based on these data, these two subjects were 
excluded from the analysis presented in this document. For consistency, geometric least-squares mean 
(GLSM) values for the PK parameters were calculated for each study and the ratio of GLSM means and 
their 90% confidence intervals for Study GS-US-216-0128 (“test”) relative to the values in each of the 
studies (reference) were determined. 
Comparison of COBI PK parameters in the adolescents in Study GS-US-216-0128 with the other studies 
revealed, generally it was shown comparable Cmax across studies while COBI AUCtau was either 
comparable or modestly (<1.7-fold) higher AUCtau.  
Nevertheless, the higher estimates for cobicistat Ctau found in Study GS-US-216-0128 have been justified  
due to a plausible CYP3A4 inhibition by Atazanavir during co-administration with different agents which 
might be altering COBI clearance. Regardless, the higher COBI Ctau when coadministered with ATV is not 
considered clinically relevant given the favourable safety profiles in studies where similar or higher Ctau 
values were observed.  
Overall, the CHMP considered cobicistat co-administered with atazanavir was well tolerated in both adults 
and paediatric subjects and Ctau high estimates were therefore considered as not clinical concern. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
The results from the submitted study do not raise any pharmacodynamic issue that prevents the use of 
this combination in the population tested.  
Pharmacokinetics 
No clinically relevant differences in ATV exposures with COBI 150 mg were observed in HIV-1 infected, 
virologically suppressed adolescents weighing ≥ 35 kg, compared with adults from the Phase 3 study 
populations. Exposures of COBI were also within the safe and efficacious ranges associated with robust 
pharmacokinetic boosting in the Tybost, Genvoya, and Stribild programs. The PK data support the use of 
COBI 150 mg-boosted ATV in paediatric patients weighing ≥ 35 kg. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
To support the current variation, the applicant has submitted, as interim report, one ongoing study (GS-
US-216-0128) that evaluated PK, safety, and efficacy data of atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat in 
paediatric patients aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years weighing at least 35 kg. Data from this study supported as 
well as the extension of indication for Tybost to cover the use of COBI (150 mg) as a pharmacokinetic

Methods 
Study Design 
Study GS-US-216-0128 is an ongoing, open-label, multicenter, multicohort, two-part study evaluating the 
PK, safety, efficacy, and antiviral activity of ATV/co or DRV/co administered with a BR in HIV-infected, 
antiretroviral treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed paediatric subjects. 
A total of 100 paediatric subjects, ages 3 months to < 18 years and of either sex are being enrolled, 
sequentially, using a staggered and staged (Part A and Part B) approach. The study proceeds in 2 parts 
(Part A and Part B), as follows: 
Part A: A minimum of 79 subjects are planned to be enrolled to evaluate the steady state PK and confirm 
the dose of ATV/co and DRV/co. Subjects are enrolled sequentially by cohort as follows: 
Part B: A minimum of 21 additional subjects are planned to be enrolled in Part B to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability and efficacy of the ATV/co or DRV/co regimen. For all cohorts in Part B, additional subjects will 
be screened and initiated sequentially by each age cohort and PI (ATV or DRV) following confirmation of 
appropriate COBI exposure and PI exposures from the corresponding age cohort in Part A. 
Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria 
Eligible subjects were antiretroviral treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed HIV-1 subjects aged 
3 months to < 18 years on a stable antiretroviral regimen comprising 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase

inhibitors (NRTIs) and either ATV/r once daily (QD) or DRV/r QD or twice daily (BID) for ≥ 3 months prior 
to screening; plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations (at least 2 consecutive measurements obtained at least 4 
weeks apart) at an undetectable level according to the assay being used, but not more than 75 
copies/mL; HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at screening; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 
90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (as calculated using the Schwartz formula; eGFRSchwartz); and adequate hematologic 
and hepatic function. 
For the CHMP committee, the inclusion and exclusion criteria have been considered acceptable. 
Treatments 
For Cohort 1, COBI 150 mg (administered as 75 mg x 2 tablets or 150 mg x 1 tablet) is administered 
orally once-daily with food, in combination with DRV or ATV and a BR. For all subjects, the BR must 
include 2 NRTIs. The BR may contain additional antiretroviral agents except for the following disallowed 
agents: saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, double PI regimens, raltegravir, elvitegravir, efavirenz, 
nevirapine, delavirdine, maraviroc, etravirine, rilpivirine, dolutegravir, and investigational antiretroviral 
agents. 
ATV is administered as either capsules or powder depending upon the subject’s body weight and ability to 
swallow capsules. ATV powder was not administered to any subjects in Cohort 1. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this ongoing study are as follows: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the steady-state PK and confirm the dose of ATV/co or DRV/co in HIV-1 infected,

through 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-experienced virologically suppressed 
paediatric subjects 3 months to < 18 years of age 
The secondary objective of this ongoing study is as follows: 
• 
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of long-term treatment of ATV/co or DRV/co, 
each co-administered with a BR, in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-experienced virologically 
suppressed paediatric subjects 3 months to < 18 years of age

percentage at Weeks 24 and 48, and every 12 weeks after Week 48 
•  Acceptability and palatability of COBI in each cohort 
The choice of endpoints has been agreed by the CHMP committee. 
Sample size 
ATV + COBI-treated subjects in Cohort 1 were enrolled and treated at a total of 7 study centers in 2 
countries (4 in the US and 3 in Thailand). Of the 28 subjects screened, 22 were enrolled and 14 received 
at least 1 dose of ATV + COBI (eight other subjects were enrolled to receive DRV + COBI). 
Randomisation 
Study GS-US-216-0128 was not a randomized study. 
Blinding (masking) 
As this was an open-label study, blinding procedures were not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
The following populations were defined: 
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. This is 
the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses. 
The safety analysis set will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. All the data 
collected up to 30 days after subjects permanently discontinue their study regimen will be included in the 
safety summaries. 
The intensive PK analysis sets for ATV, DRV, and COBI, respectively, will include all Part A subjects who 
received at least one dose of study drug and for whom steady-state PK profiles at Day 10 intensive PK 
visits are evaluable. The intensive PK analysis set will be used for detailed PK analysis of ATV, DRV, and 
COBI. 
The PK analysis set will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and for whom at 
least one observed concentration data of any analyte of interest (ie, ATV, DRV, and COBI) is available. 
The PK analysis set will be used for analysis of general PK and trough blood concentrations. 
Results 
At the time of the Interim Analysis 1, 50.0% (7 of 14) of ATV + COBI-treated subjects remained on study 
drug regimen, while the other 50.0% (7 of 14) of subjects receiving ATV + COBI were prematurely 
discontinued from the study. The reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent (n = 3), 
noncompliance with study drug (n = 2), and investigator’s discretion (n = 1) and pregnancy (n = 1).

Protocol Deviations 
A total of 17 important protocol deviations occurred in 10 subjects during the study. Of the 10 subjects 
with important protocol deviations, 6 subjects had a single important deviation and 4 subjects had 2 or 
more important deviations. The majority of important protocol deviations (15 of 17) were for study drug 
compliance < 70% or missed study protocol assessments. 
According to the MAH, none of these important protocol deviations affected the overall quality or 
interpretation of the study data. 
Baseline data 
Overall, the majority of subjects receiving ATV + COBI were male (71.4%) with a median age of 14 
(range: 12 to 17) years. The median (first quartile [Q1], third quartile [Q3]) baseline estimated 
glomerular filtration rate by Schwartz formula (eGFRSchwartz) was 166.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 
(148.4 mL/min/1.73m2, 198.8 mL/min/1.73m2). Body weight for all subjects varied from 32.3 to 81.4 kg. 
The median (first quartile [Q1], third quartile [Q3]) baseline body weight for all subjects was 52.7 
(interquartile range 46.5 to 63.3) kg, with a range of 32.3 to 81.4 kg. One patient in Cohort 1 was less 
than the proposed indication weight cut-off of ≥ 35 kg, but was above the study entry criteria weight cut-
off of Cohort 1 (≥ 25 kg). 
The study enrolled a virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected population; thus, all subjects in the Safety 
Analysis Set for Cohort 1 Part A had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, with the exception of 1 
subject whose baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA value was 50 copies/mL . This subject was eligible for 
enrolment per the inclusion criteria, as this subject had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at screening visits. 
The median baseline CD4 cell count overall was 770 cells/μL, with 92.9% of subjects having a baseline 
CD4 cell count ≥ 500 cells/μL.

The median (Q1, Q3) number of years since diagnosis of HIV-1 infection was 14 (12, 15) years. The only 
mode of infection in all subjects was vertical transmission. At baseline, 78.6% (11 of 14) of subjects 
overall were asymptomatic, 14.3% (2 of 14) of subjects had a historic diagnosis of AIDS, and 7.1% (1 of 
14) had symptomatic HIV-1 infection.

The participant flow, the baseline data and the numbers analysed are considered described adequately by 
the CHMP committee.  
Outcomes and estimation 
The results of the efficacy analyses in virologically suppressed paediatric subjects at Week 24 and Week 
48 using the USFDA-defined snapshot algorithm demonstrate that the rates of virologic suppression (HIV-
1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) were as follows for those who were coadministered ATV + COBI: 
•  Week 24: 64.3% (9 of 14 subjects) 
Four subjects had HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at Week 24 but remained in the study at the investigators’ 
discretion and subsequently re-suppressed HIV-1 RNA to < 50 copies/mL at Week 48. One ATV + COBI-
treated subject had missing Week 24 data, but was on study drug. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294308/2021 
Page 33/51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At Week 48, with the four subjects having re-suppressed to HIV-1 RNA to <50 copies/mL, 92.9% (13 of 
14 subjects) in Cohort 1 Part A had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL using the US FDA defined snapshot 
algorithm. 
One subject had HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at Week 48, remained viraemic at the Week 48 retest visit 
(HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL by snapshot analysis), and beyond Week 48. This subject was discontinued 
from study drug regimen at Week 108 due to noncompliance with study drug.  
The results of the efficacy analyses at Weeks 12, 24 and 48 using the M = E analysis demonstrated that 
the rates of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) were as follows for those who were 
coadministered ATV + COBI: 
•  Week 12: 100.0% (14 of 14 subjects) 
•  Week 24: 69.2% (9 of 13 subjects) 
•  Week 48: 92.9% (13 of 14 subjects) 
Ancillary analyses 
Individual Subjects with Virologic Failure  
For those who were coadministered ATV + COBI, the Resistance Analysis Population contained 3 subjects 
in Cohort 1 Part A who experienced protocol-defined virologic failure during the first 48 weeks of the 
study. Post-baseline genotypic and phenotypic data were available for 1 subject and showed no 
resistance in protease or reverse transcriptase. The other 2 subjects had no postbaseline data due to 
assay failure. 
Immunologic Change 
In this virologically suppressed paediatric study population with high baseline mean CD4 cell count and 
CD4%, there were no clinically relevant changes from Baseline in CD4 cell counts and CD4% for Cohort 1 
Part A at Interim Analysis 1. 
CD4 Cell Counts (Median [min, max]): 
•  Baseline: 770 (486, 1765) cells/μL 
•  Week 24: 721 (384, 1234) cells/μL 
•  Week 48: 605 (473, 1490) cells/μL 
At Week 48, the median change from Baseline in CD4+ cell count was -60 cells/μL. 
CD4% (Median [min, max]): 
•  Baseline: 33.3% (22.8%, 44.7%) 
•  Week 24: 30.5% (23.0%, 48.7%) 
•  Week 48: 33.9% (22.4%, 53.0%) 
At Week 48, the median change from Baseline in CD4+% was -0.3%.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
To support the current variation, the applicant has submitted, as interim report, one ongoing study (GS-
US-216-0128) that evaluated PK, safety, and efficacy data of atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat in 
paediatric patients aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years weighing at least 35 kg. Although Study GS-US-216-0128 is 
evaluating paediatric subjects who are receiving ATV + COBI or DRV + COBI, the data submitted focuses 
on the ATV + COBI data from the Interim Analysis 1 of Cohort 1 Part A, consisting of paediatric subjects 
12 to < 18 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A total of 22 subjects were included of whom 14 subjects received ATV + COBI. Eligible subjects were 
antiretroviral treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed HIV-1 subjects aged 3 months to < 18 
years on a stable antiretroviral regimen comprising 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) 
and either ATV/r once daily (QD) or DRV/r QD or twice daily (BID) for ≥ 3 months prior to screening; 
plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations (at least 2 consecutive measurements obtained at least 4 weeks apart) 
at an undetectable level according to the assay being used, but not more than 75 copies/mL; HIV-1 RNA 
< 50 copies/mL at screening; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (as 
calculated using the Schwartz formula; eGFRSchwartz); and adequate hematologic and hepatic function. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The virologic response rate, defined as the number and percentage of subjects with plasma viral load 
< 50 HIV 1 RNA copies/mL at Week 48 (per FDA Snapshot approach, FAS population) was 92.9% (13/14) 
in Cohort 1. The results were consistent with M=E analysis.  
The Resistance Analysis Population contained 3 subjects treated with ATV + COBI in Cohort 1 Part A who 
experienced protocol-defined virologic failure during the first 48 weeks of the study. Post-baseline 
genotypic and phenotypic data were available for 1 subject and showed no resistance in protease or 
reverse transcriptase. The other 2 subjects had no postbaseline data due to assay failure. 
In this virologically suppressed paediatric study population with high baseline mean CD4 cell count and 
CD4%, there were no clinically relevant changes from Baseline in CD4 cell counts and CD4% for Cohort 1 
Part A at Interim Analysis 1. 
During clinical study GS-US-216-0128, it was anticipated that a number of adolescent patients may have 
difficulties to swallow the whole tablets due to the large size of Evotaz fixed-dose combination tablets (19 
mm x 10.4 mm). 
The applicant does not recommend the splitting or crushing of the fixed-dose tablet, as it would result in 
the unpleasant taste and likely a lack of compliance with an increased risk for a loss in the overall total 
administered dose. The MAH is encouraged to conduct an age appropriate formulation development as 
per the PIP. Nevertheless, the currently approved adult ATV/COBI fixed-dose combination tablet is 
considered acceptable use in adolescents 12 years to 18 years, weighing at least 35 kg. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on efficacy analyses at Week 24 and Week 48 using the USFDA defined snapshot algorithm, the 
rates of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) were 64.3% at Week 24 and 92.9% at Week 
Assessment report

48 for ATV + COBI, and high rates of virologic suppression were maintained beyond Week 48. There were 
no clinically relevant changes in CD4 cell counts and CD4%. No subjects developed treatment-emergent 
drug resistance substitutions in protease or reverse transcriptase. 
The results from the submitted study showed an acceptable efficacy of the combination of atazanavir with 
cobicistat, although the sample size is limited. These results could be considered applicable to the fixed 
dose combination of these two substances. 
Although it would be preferable to allow the splitting or crushing of tablets for adolescents (or adults) 
with difficulty in swallowing tablets, the CHMP agreed on the acceptability of the use in adolescents of the 
current approved adult ATV/COBI fixed-dose combination tablet formulation.  
Additionally, considering that other authorised antiretrovirals indicated for the treatment of adolescents 
are available as tablets with size similar to the size of Evotaz. Some of these tablets are also authorized 
to be swallowed whole and nothing is mentioned in their prescribing information regarding patients with 
difficulty in swallowing tablets.  
Nevertheless, regarding the unpleasant taste of ATV and COBI, CHMP noted that other two cobicistat-
containing medicinal products which can be split into two pieces to be taken together after splitting, 
among the other authorised antiretrovirals indicated for the treatment of adolescents with size similar to 
the size of Evotaz. 
In conclusion, the CHMP suggested to endeavour the development of acceptable age-appropriate 
formulation(s) for younger paediatric populations, as outlined in the recently approved RfM03 to the PIP 
for Evotaz (EMA/PDCO/444877/2020). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted the safety data of ATV + COBI in HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced, virologically 
suppressed paediatric subjects 12 to < 18 years weighing ≥ 25 kg participating in Cohort 1 Part A of 
Study GS-US-216-0128. 
Patient exposure 
The median (Q1, Q3) exposure to ATV + COBI in the paediatric population from Cohort 1 Part A studied 
in GS-US-216-0128 was 160.0 (110.6, 181.3) weeks, with 100% (14 of 14) of subjects receiving study 
drug for ≥ 48 weeks.

For subjects who had not prematurely discontinued study drug, the data-cut date (01-Jun-2018) was used to impute the last dose date. 
Adverse events 
In Interim Analysis 1, 92.9% of all ATV + COBI-treated subjects (13 of 14) had at least 1 AE reported, 
the majority of which were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and not considered by the investigator to be related 
to study drug. Grade 3 AEs were reported for 14.3% of subjects (2 of 14; wrist fracture and substance 
abuse), none of which were considered related to study drug.  
The following were the 3 most commonly reported AEs in subjects treated with ATV + COBI: 
•  Upper respiratory tract infection (50.0%, 7 of 14 subjects), 
•  Cough (21.4%, 3 of 14 subjects), 
•  Nasal congestion (21.4%, 3 of 14 subjects) 
The overall incidence and types of common AEs were consistent with those expected in the study population.

Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically relevant changes from Baseline for median values of haematology or clinical 
chemistry (excluding some liver-related parameters). Median values were within the relevant reference 
ranges. 
All subjects (100%; 14 of 14) receiving ATV + COBI had at least 1 laboratory abnormality. The 
abnormalities reported were Grade 1 or 2 in severity for 28.5% of subjects (4 of 14); Grade 3 for 64.3% 
of subjects (9 of 14); and a transient Grade 4 laboratory abnormality (creatine kinase increased) was 
reported for 1 subject.  
Grade 3 abnormalities were reported as follows: Grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia (57.1%, 8 of 14 subjects), 
Grade 3 haematuria by quantitative assessment (14.3%, 2 of 14 subjects; both female), Grade 3 alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increased (7.1%, 1 of 14 subjects), Grade 3 amylase increased (7.1%, 1 of 14 
subjects), Grade 3 bicarbonate decreased (7.1%, 1 of 14 subjects), and Grade 3 fasting low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) increased (7.1%, 1 of 14 subjects).  
The subject who had a Grade 4 creatine kinase level had a normal baseline creatine kinase level of 151 
U/L (reference range, 18 – 198 U/L) that increased to 5784 U/L at Week 8, decreased to normal levels 
from Weeks 12 to 24, then remained above normal (range, 208 to 370 U/L) from Weeks 32 to 108 (ie, 
last visit [subject was prematurely discontinued from the study drug combination and study at the 
investigator’s discretion]). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels also transiently increased to 134 U/L 
at Week 8 in this subject, after which they decreased to normal levels. 
Most laboratory abnormalities were isolated and transient occurrences. No subject had an SAE associated 
with a clinical laboratory abnormality. 
Safety in special populations 
No new information is submitted. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No relevant data on this topic could be retrieved from the currently evaluated trial. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No ATV + COBI treated subjects has AEs leading to premature discontinuations. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The Week-48 interim analysis data from Study GS-US-216-0128 is based on the exposure of 14 patients 
who received ATV + COBI in Cohort 1 [aged ≥12 to <18 years]. Atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat, 
was generally safe and well tolerated in the studied HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced paediatric population 
(aged ≥12 to <18 years).  
There were no newly identified clinically relevant safety findings in subjects analysed.  
Serious AEs were reported for 21.4% of all ATV + COBI-treated subjects (3 of 14; clavicle fracture and foot 
fracture  for  1  subject;  substance  abuse  and  appendicitis  for  1  subject  each),  and  were  not  considered 
related to study drug. There were no drug-related serious AEs, and there were no deaths. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294308/2021 
Page 40/51 
 
 
 
 
There were no clinically relevant changes from Baseline for median values of haematology or clinical 
chemistry (excluding some liver-related parameters). Median values were within the relevant reference 
ranges. 
Taking  the  low  sample  size  into  account,  the  safety  profile  of  atazanavir  coadministered  with  cobicistat 
appears to be consistent with the established safety profile in adults. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
From the limited information provided by the MAH, there are no particular concerns to highlight from the 
use of the combination of atazanavir with cobicistat in children from 12 to 18 years of age. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) version 8.0 dated 18 August 2020 with this 
application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8.0 dated 18 August 2020 is acceptable. In 
addition, minor revisions were recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update, as 
follows: 
Although it can be agreed that no changes are made within the current procedure, the MAH is requested 
to revise the extensive Summary of Safety Concerns at the next regulatory opportunity, to be in line with 
the current version of GVP Module V.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As  consequence  of  this  new  indication,  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC  have  been 
updated to include the language on the use of EVOTAZ in combination with other antiretroviral agents in 
the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adolescent patients aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years, weighing ≥ 35 kg without 
known  mutations  associated  with  resistance  to  atazanavir.  The  Package  Leaflet  has  been  updated 
accordingly.  In  addition,  the  Marketing  authorisation  holder  (MAH)  took  the  opportunity  to  make  minor 
editorial corrections. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
This extension of indication does not introduce any relevant changes to the approved PIL and for this 
reason a new user consultation is not required; 
The key safety messages are essentially the same for this new indication; as explained by the MAH, 
the route of administration, the pharmaceutical form and the posology remain unchanged. The only 
differences are related to the text of the therapeutic indication in order to reflect the new population; 
Thera are also no changes with regards to the design and layout of the PIL 
The MAH has submitted the results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the PIL in 
the context of the MAA (EC decision issued on 13 July 2015) and it was considered that the PIL met 
the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package 
leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
The above presented reasons fully justify the rational for not performing a new user consultation. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HIV-1 infection is a life-threatening and serious disease that is of major public health interest. There are 
approximately 34 million people living with HIV-1. The infection, if left untreated or sub-optimally treated, 
is characterized by deterioration in immune function, the subsequent occurrence of opportunistic 
infections and malignancies, ultimately resulting in death. Infants and children infected with HIV-1 tend to 
progress more rapidly than adults to symptomatic disease. Therapeutic strategies for the treatment of 
adults and children with HIV-1 disease have been significantly advanced by the availability of highly 
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Several antiretroviral drugs are approved for the treatment of HIV-
1 infection in children who are naïve to treatment. Current DHHS paediatric treatment guidelines 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/294308/2021 
Page 46/51 
 
 
 
 
recommend combination therapy for children, including either a NNRTI or PI/r, plus a dual NRTI backbone 
for initial treatment. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
First-line antiretroviral therapy in paediatric patients is based upon the same principle of combination 
therapy for adults but consists of fewer approved options available for treatment. The recommended first-
line 2-NRTI backbone is dependent upon age and the availability of the formulation. 
Cobicistat (150 mg once daily [QD] tablet) is currently indicated as a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer of 
atazanavir (ATV) 300 mg once daily or darunavir (DRV) 800 mg once daily as part of antiretroviral (ARV) 
combination therapy in HIV-1 infected adults. Cobicistat provides patients with a potent, convenient, well-
tolerated, and practical PK enhancer of ATV and DRV containing ARV regimens in the treatment of HIV-1 
infected adults. Cobicistat in combination with ATV or DRV with 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is one regimen recommended by both the US Department of Health and 
Human Services guidelines for the treatment of HIV-1 in adults {Department for Health and Human 
Services (DHHS) 2018},  the International Antiviral Society – USA Panel {Saag 2018} and the European 
AIDS Clinical Society guidelines; Additionally, COBI-boosted DRV with 2 NRTIs is a recommended 
regimen and COBI-boosted ATV is an alternative regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 in adults {European 
AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) 2018}. 
EVOTAZ is an oral immediate-release, film-coated fixed-dose tablet containing 300 mg ATV and 150 mg 
COBI indicated in the United States (US), European Union (EU) and other countries for use in combination 
with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in 
adults. 
Considering that the indication for cobicistat (as an individual active substance) was recently extended to 
cover the use of COBI (150 mg) as a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer for the HIV-1 protease inhibitors 
(PIs) ATV (300 mg) or darunavir (DRV) (800 mg) in combination with other antiretroviral agents in the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection in paediatric patients aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years weighing at least 35 kg co-
administered with ATV or at least 40 kg co-administered with DRV (EMEA/H/C/002572/II-0051; EC 
Decision 09-Mar-2020), the MAH submitted the same data to support the extension of indication to 
include the use of Evotaz in combination with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV-1 
infection in paediatric patients aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years, weighing ≥ 35 kg. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current application is based on the interim results from the ongoing paediatric Study GS-US-216-
0128. This study is an ongoing, open-label, multicenter, multicohort, two-part study to evaluate the PK, 
safety, efficacy, and antiviral activity of ATV + COBI or DRV + COBI administered with a background 
regimen (BR) in HIV-1-infected, treatment experienced, virologically suppressed paediatric subjects. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Based on efficacy analyses at Week 24 and Week 48 using the USFDA defined snapshot algorithm, the 
rates of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) were 64.3% at Week 24 and 92.9% at Week 
48 for ATV + COBI, and high rates of virologic suppression were maintained beyond Week 48. There were 
no clinically relevant changes in CD4 cell counts and CD4%. No subjects developed treatment-emergent 
drug resistance substitutions in protease or reverse transcriptase.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No data was obtained from the use of the fixed dose combination in this patient population. The 
bioequivalence of the approved fixed-dose tablet Evotaz (ATV/COBI; 300 mg/150 mg) to the 
coadministration of the single components of 300 mg ATV + 150 mg COBI was demonstrated in the adult 
Phase 1 registrational study (Study AI424511). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No clinically relevant safety signals have been identified with the coadministration of approved doses of 
ATV and COBI to adolescent subjects weighing ≥ 35 kg. No new warnings or precautions are warranted 
based on the data described. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The Week 48 analysis data from Study GS-US-216-0128 is based on the exposure of 14 adolescents 
(small sample size). There are no other limitations and uncertainties in regard to the unfavourable effects 
that might have an impact on the benefit-risk balance. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy and safety of cobicistat in association with atazanavir in the treatment of HIV-1 was also 
demonstrated for adolescent subjects. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In HIV infected adolescent subjects weighing ≥ 35 kg the benefits driven by the use of Evotaz as part of 
combination ART could outweigh the risks associated with its use. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The generation of additional data regarding acceptability (swallowability) or an evaluation on the splitting 
of the Evotaz fixed-dose combination tablets was not considered to be warranted for this application. The 
currently approved adult formulation is considered appropriate for use in adolescents 12 years to 18 
years, weighing at least 35 kg. Evotaz currently “is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults without known mutations associated with 
resistance to atazanavir.” The present Type II-038 variation for Evotaz proposes to extend the indication 
to paediatric patients who are “adolescents aged 12 years to 18 years, weighing at least 35 kg” 
(henceforth simply referred to as adolescents). The currently marketed fixed-dose formulation of Evotaz 
is an oval, biconvex, bilayer pink film-coated tablet, 19 × 10.4 mm in size, debossed with 3641 on one 
side and with a plain face on the other side. It is not scored to facilitate splitting. It contains two drug 
substances, 300 mg atazanavir (ATV) (as sulfate) and 150 mg cobicistat (COBI) (on silicon dioxide). It 
also contains the following excipients: stearic acid, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, 
crospovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, croscarmellose sodium and Opadry Pink (a 
film-coating material containing titanium dioxide, talc, triacetin, red iron oxide, and hypromellose). The 
Opadry film coat is inactive. The tablets are supplied in a high-density polyethylene bottle with a 
desiccant, child-resistant cap with heat induction seal activated.

The film-coated bilayer tablet of the currently marketed formulation confers acceptable palatability to the 
ATV and COBI components in a fixed-dose presentation. Taste evaluations of age-appropriate 
formulations of ATV and COBI as individual components, conducted by a trained taste panel, showed that 
each component had a very strong and lingering bitterness and a strong initial burnt aromatic. The 
combination of ATV with COBI presented with an even more intense taste compared to each of the 
components alone (EMA/PDCO/153723/2017). As such, the splitting or crushing of the fixed-dose tablet 
would result in the exposure of both ATV and COBI components to the oral mucosa when administered, 
leading to a very unpleasant taste and likely a lack of compliance. Furthermore, the bilayer design may 
cause fragmentation when attempting to split the tablet, thereby increasing the risk for a loss in the 
overall total administered dose. In addition, the MAH believes that the currently approved adult ATV/COBI 
fixed-dose combination tablet is acceptable for adolescents on the basis that similarly sized tablet 
products are approved in the EU for adolescents. The MAH provided a table with a summary of tablet 
sizes (presented in descending order by tablet length), similar to the size of Evotaz, for other fixed-dose 
tablets authorised in the EU for the treatment of HIV in the adolescent patient population.  
The MAH will monitor for reported issues regarding the use of Evotaz tablets in the adolescent patient 
population in accordance with routine pharmacovigilance surveillance measures. In the meantime, the 
MAH continues to endeavour the development of acceptable age appropriate formulation(s) for younger 
paediatric populations, as outlined in the recently approved RfM03 to the PIP for Evotaz 
(EMA/PDCO/444877/2020). 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Evotaz in the additional age group for whom indication is sought is considered to be 
positive.

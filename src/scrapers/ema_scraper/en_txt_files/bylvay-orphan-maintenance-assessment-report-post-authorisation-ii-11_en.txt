2.   Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2012 was 
based on the following grounds: 
“Whereas, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), having examined the application, 
concluded: 
•  Alagille syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be affecting not 
more than 0.3 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the application was made; this 
is based on a literature search conducted by the sponsor.  
• 
• 
The condition is chronically debilitating due to hepatic and cardiac dysfunction. Pruritus is a 
common symptom associated with cholestasis. Portal hypertension develops in up to one third of 
patients. In 75% of patients life expectancy is around 20years and death is associated with liver 
failure, cardiac problems and blood vessel abnormalities.  
There is, at present, no satisfactory method of treatment that has been authorised in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP recommends the designation of this medicinal product, containing (2S)-2-{[(2R)-2-[({[3,3-
dibutyl-7-(methylthio)-1,1-dioxido-5-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro- 1,2,5-benzothiadiazepin-8-
yl]oxy}acetyl)amino]-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl]amino}butanoic acid, as an orphan medicinal product 
for the orphan indication: treatment of Alagille syndrome”. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Condition Alagille syndrome is a highly heterogenous, autosomal dominant multisystem condition and 
is caused by mutations in one of two genes: JAG1 and NOTCH2. It was initially described as a hepatic 
disease, but molecular testing has shown that individuals with ALGS and JAG1 or NOTCH2 mutations 
may present without overt liver disease.  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 4/42 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1.  Summary of molecular genetic testing used in ALGS 
ALGS is a multisystem disorder with a wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms ranging from 
lifethreatening liver or congenital cardiac defects to only subclinical manifestations, such as mildly 
abnormal liver enzymes, a heart murmur, butterfly vertebrae, posterior embryotoxon (a thickening of 
the Schwalbe's line of the cornea), or characteristic facial features. This variability is present even 
among individuals from the same family sharing the same mutation.  
Table 2.  A summary of the clinical features and the frequency reported among individuals with ALGS  
In the majority of cases, individuals with ALGS present in infancy with cholestasis (conjugated 
hyperbilirubinemia with high GGT, increased serum bile acids, and elevated cholesterol and 
triglycerides), which manifest as jaundice, intense pruritus, xanthomas (fatty deposits on the extensor 
surfaces), and failure to thrive due to fat malabsorption. Cardiac findings ranging from benign heart 
murmurs to significant structural defects occur in 90%–97% of individuals with ALGS. Pulmonic 
stenosis (peripheral and branch) is the most common cardiac finding (60-67%). The most common 
complex cardiac defect is tetralogy of Fallot, which is seen in 7%–16% of individuals. Other cardiac 
malformations include ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, aortic stenosis, and coarctation of 
the aorta (in order of decreasing frequency). The typical facial features (see Table 2 above) are almost 
universally present in ALGS due to JAG1 mutations. The typical facial features do not seem to be as 
prevalent in individuals with ALGS carrying a NOTCH2 mutation. The mortality is 
10%, with vascular 
accidents, cardiac disease, and liver disease being the most frequent cause of death (The Application 
of Clinical Genetics 2016:9 75–82). Alagille syndrome is diagnosed when an individual has three out of 
∼
seven major clinical features. See Figure 1 below for diagnostic framework. Individuals with an affected 
first-degree relative and who do not meet full clinical criteria but with the presence of one or more 
clinical features should be diagnosed with Alagille syndrome. Infants younger than 6 months of age 
may not present with a marked paucity of the bile ducts or even present with ductal proliferation that 
could lead to a misdiagnosis of biliary atresia. Traditionally, the clinical diagnostic criteria for ALGS 
included liver histology showing bile duct paucity (an increased portal tract-to-bile duct ratio) and 
three of five major clinical features: cholestasis; ophthalmologic abnormalities (commonly posterior

Page 5/42 
 
 
 
 
 
embryotoxon); characteristic facial features; cardiac defect (see Table 2); and skeletal abnormalities 
(commonly butterfly vertebrae). The five criteria have been increased to seven which are: cardiac 
defects, hepatic manifestation, renal abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, ophthalmologic 
manifestations, dysmorphic facies and vasculature abnormalities. Bile duct paucity on liver histology is 
no longer considered mandatory for the diagnosis of Alagille syndrome, the presence of cholestasis can 
be used instead. (Alagille Syndrome Article - StatPearlshttps://www.statpearls.com › Article Library › 
view article 14 Aug 2022 https://www.statpearls.com/ArticleLibrary/viewarticle/17321). 
Figure 1.  Flow diagram of genetic investigations and management for suspected ALGS patients 
The approved therapeutic indication “Bylvay is indicated for the treatment of cholestasis and pruritus in 
Alagille syndrome (ALGS) in patients aged 6 months or older” falls within the scope of the designated 
orphan condition “treatment of Alagille syndrome”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has yet to be confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to chronic cholestasis due to paucity of 
intrahepatic bile ducts, progressing to portal hypertension and liver failure. Pruritus (itching) is 
reported as the most bothersome symptom of ALGS across all ages by patients and caregivers 
(Kamath et al. 2018b), which is difficult to treat, leads to cutaneous mutilation, mood disturbances, 
disruption of sleep and school performance, and has negative impact on physical and psychosocial 
health (Elisofon et al. 2010; Kamath et al. 2015, Kamath et al. 2018b), as well as overall Quality of 
Life (Abetz-Webb et al. 2014). Twenty-one percent to 31% of patients require liver transplantation

during childhood, including approximately 50% of those diagnosed in infancy. Cardiac dysfunction also 
occurs due to cardiac defects which are reported in greater than 90% of patients and include 
peripheral pulmonic stenosis (60-67%), tetralogy of Fallot (7-16%), ventricular septal defect, atrial 
septal defect, aortic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta. Associated with cardiac defects are 
vasculature abnormalities which when present, are often associated with neurovascular abnormalities 
such as aneurysms, Moyamoya syndrome, abnormalities in cerebral arteries, reno-vascular 
abnormalities, and middle aortic syndrome. 
Intracranial bleeding can also occur. Additional involvement of other systems/organs contributes to the 
chronically debilitating nature of the disease, including butterfly vertebrae, posterior embryotoxon 
and/or anterior segment abnormalities of the eyes, pigmentary retinopathy, and dysplastic kidney. The 
reported mortality is 
10%, with vascular accidents, cardiac disease, and liver disease being the most 
frequent cause of death. In a retrospective analysis of 1,154 children from 25 countries with a clinically 
∼
and/or genetically confirmed ALGS diagnosis the 18-year survival was 88.6% (Vandriel et al. 2020). 
Mortality is high in the very young age because of the concurrent severe cardiac malformations. 
Number of people affected or at risk. 
The sponsor has submitted a prevalence estimate based on the original designation. The reasoning is 
that no new data has been published since the initial submission.  
There is still very limited information on the birth incidence and prevalence of ALGS. In 2014, the 
estimate by Danks in 1977 was revised to 1 in 30,000 to 50,000 live births owing to more recent 
evidence showing that a notable proportion of individuals with the JAG1 mutation would not have been 
diagnosed with ALGS on the basis of clinical characteristics alone [Leonard 2014]. This incidence has 
later been cited by Kamath et al [Kamath 2018 and 2020a], Ayoub et al [Ayoub 2020], and Vandriel 
et al [Vandriel 2023]. Two other publications have been identified, and neither include new analyses. 
Saleh et al [Saleh 2016] refer to Gene Reviews [Spinner 2019] and claim that the incidence is 
1/30,000. However, the Gene Reviews on ALGS refer back to Saleh 2016 when claiming that the 
incidence is 1/30,000. It is likely that ultimately, they both refer to the same Kamath publication 
already cited in the initial application.  
Table 3.  Prevalence Resources used in the Initial Application 
A birth incidence of 0.3/10 000 was proposed by the sponsor. This gives a total of 123 ALGS patients 
born/year, corresponding to a yearly birth incidence of 0.003/10 000 (123/ (447 000 000x10 000)). 
(4.1 million babies born in the EU in 2020; https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-
explained/index.php?title=Fertility_statistics) 
Considering that most liver transplants occur in childhood, a conservative average life span of 70 years 
for patients with ALGS was used. Based on this, the prevalence can be calculated as follows using the 
incidence x duration formula: 0.003/10 000 x 70 years = 0.2/10 000. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 7/42 
 
 
 
 
Despite the lower number achieved (0.2) taking life expectancy into account, a final estimate of 0.3 in 
10,000 is proposed by the sponsor to be the current prevalence in the EU. The COMP accepted the 
proposed prevalence of 0.3 in 10,000. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor has identified one centrally authorised product: maralixibat (Livmarli). Livmarli is 
indicated for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) 2 months 
of age and older. As Livmarli covers the same patient population as Bylvay, it is considered a 
satisfactory method and will have to be discussed in the significant benefit section. 
It was noted by the COMP that off-label use with the following products has been reported: 
ursodeoxycholic acid, cholestyramine, rifampicin and naltrexone. These products are used in the 
management of pruritus and xanthoma but generally have limited success (Kronsten et al. J Pediatr 
Gastroenterol Nutr. 2013 Aug;57(2):149-54). Surgical interventions are used to treat cholestatic 
disease in ALGS and include surgical biliary diversion (SBD) procedures and liver transplantation. SBD 
procedures may not be fully effective and can lead to electrolyte disturbances and dehydration 
(Emerick et al. 1999; Kamath et al. 2018). Liver transplantation is associated with considerable safety 
risks, and donors are limited available. 
There are no formal European Guidelines regarding the management and treatment of these patients. 
Significant benefit 
Protocol Assistance was sought by the sponsor but no question on significant benefit was asked as an 
approved product was only recently authorised (Livmarli, December 2022).  
Significant benefit based on a clinically relevant advantage of Bylvay over Livmarli 
To establish significant benefit a Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison or MAIC between maralixibat 
and odevixibat has been submitted.  
A comparison of the study design features of the pivotal odevixibat and maralixibat studies is provided 
in Table 4. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 8/42 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 4.  Study design features of the pivotal odevixibat and maralixibat 
Study LUM001-304 was a Phase 2, long-term, open-label study with a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled drug withdrawal phase in patients with ALGS. The study was designed to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of maralixibat and was comprised of an 18-week open-label run-in phase 
(6-week dose escalation and 12-week stable maralixibat dosing), followed by a 4-week randomised 
withdrawal (RWD) phase. To improve gastrointestinal tolerability, patients were required to dose 
escalate gradually over the initial 6-week treatment period from a starting dose of 14 µg/kg/day to 
400 µg/kg/day. Following the RWD, patients were treated for 26 weeks in a stable-dosing period at 
doses up to 400 µg/kg/day, and in an optional long-term treatment period (long-term extension 
phase; LTE) [Gonzales 2021]. Placebo control was utilised in the 4-week RWD phase only. The RWD 
design has limitations due to the short-term treatment assessment period, evaluation of an enriched 
population, potential carry-over effects, and difficulty in extrapolation of the treatment effect to the 
general population. Overall, 31 patients within the age range of 1 and 15 years (inclusive) were 
treated in Study LUM001-304. The primary endpoint of the study was the difference in the change in 
mean fasting serum bile acids at the end of the RWD phase compared to Week 18 of open-label 
treatment (i.e. just prior to the RWD phase) as analysed in the modified intent to treat population 
(mITT). Because the mITT population was enriched, including only those participants who previously 
achieved a serum bile acid reduction of ≥ 50% during the open-label run-in phase, the primary efficacy 
analysis was limited to a small sample of the enrolled population, including only 15 of the 31 patients 
(placebo n=10, maralixibat n=5) [Gonzales 2021]. The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the 
change from Week 18 to Week 22 in pruritus severity as measured by the weekly morning average 
Itch Reported Outcome (Observer) (ItchRO[Obs]) score (AM score), maralixibat vs placebo, during the 
RWD phase. A total of 29 patients who completed Week 18 of the open-label period were included in 
the pruritus analysis. 
In contrast, Study A4250-012 was a Phase 3, multicentre, multinational, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel group study conducted in 52 patients with a genetically confirmed 
diagnosis of ALGS. Randomisation was 2:1 (odevixibat:placebo). The study evaluated the efficacy and 
safety of odevixibat administered at a dose of 120 µg/kg/day compared to placebo for 24 weeks. The 
primary efficacy endpoint for the study was the change from baseline to Month 6 (Weeks 21-24) in 
average AM and PM scratching severity scores as measured by the Albireo ObsRO caregiver instrument 
in the full analysis set (FAS) comprised of all 52 randomised patients. The key secondary efficacy 
endpoint was the change from baseline to the average of Week 20 and Week 24 in serum bile acid 
levels in the FAS population. 
For the indirect comparison of results from Study LUM001-304 and Study A4250-012, only unanchored 
comparisons could be performed due to the difference in study designs, including different durations of 
the placebo-controlled period (4 weeks vs 24 weeks, respectively) in each trial. The endpoints for 
comparison that were chosen depended on availability of published data from the maralixibat 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 9/42 
 
 
 
 
Study LUM001-304 and the nearest equivalent data from Study A4250-012. Based on this, serum bile 
acids and pruritus score, which were assessed at Week 22 of maralixibat Study LUM001-304, were 
chosen as the most appropriate endpoints for comparison to the odevixibat Study A4250-012. 
Clinically relevant advantage based on efficacy 
At Week 22, a greater reduction from baseline in serum bile acids was observed for odevixibat 
compared with maralixibat with mean absolute change from baseline of -141.9 µmol/L 
and -101.7 µmol/L, respectively, and a difference of -40.2 µmol/L.  
Similarly, at Week 22, treatment with odevixibat led to greater reductions in pruritis severity scores 
compared to maralixibat with LS mean differences of -0.39 for nighttime score, -0.23 for daytime 
score, -0.30 for average AM+PM score, and -0.18 for worst AM+PM score. 
Table 5.  Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison: Mean (95% CI) Changes from Baseline in Serum 
Bile Acids and Pruritus Severity Score to Week 22 (Study LUM001-304 and Study A4250-012) 
The sponsor concludes that the MAIC results support evidence of improved efficacy of odevixibat 
versus maralixibat. They argue that there were greater mean reductions in serum bile acid levels and 
pruritus severity scores were consistently seen in all endpoints, in favour of odevixibat. The between-
group differences in mean values did not reach statistical significance that would indicate superiority; 
however, this result was expected given the sample sizes (n=13 for maralixibat and n=35 for 
odevixibat). 
The COMP noted that unanchored MAICs come with limitations where it is assumed that the adjusted 
analysis accounts for all important prognostic and predictive factors.  
For Livmarli the comparison includes all patients who were randomized to Livmarli (i.e. not restricted 
to responders during run-in phase as used for the primary efficacy analysis), which is reasonable. 
The unadjusted differences in mean serum bile acid at BL seem most prominent with higher values in 
the Livmarli (maralixibat) arm (mean of 318 vs 237.4).  Adjusted estimated differences for sBA favour 
Bylvay but are not significant. For the AM scores, different dimensions of pruritus were assessed in 
both trials which is a limitation for comparability. The COMP noted that there was missing information 
on the effective sample sizes following adjustment. In addition to the MAIC, naive unweighted 
indirect comparisons using available IPD were conducted using data from the maralixibat-treated 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

patients in Study LUM001-304 and the odevixibat-treated patients in Study A4250-012. This was done 
for pruritus severity, serum bile acids and xanthomas, but in this report only the severity of pruritus is 
commented upon. 
•  Comparison of Changes in Pruritus Severity 
As an initial investigation of the efficacy of odevixibat compared to maralixibat, an evaluation of the 
change in pruritus severity across the 2 studies was conducted. Specifically, an indirect comparison of 
naïve unweighted data based on IPD from both trials was performed using empirical distribution 
functions for change from baseline in the maralixibat ItchRO(Obs) using published data from 
Study LUM001-304 by Gonzales, et al [Gonzales 2021] and the odevixibat ObsRO scratching severity 
weekly average AM score at Week 22; the results were plotted and analysed (Figure 2). A clear upward 
separation from -2.5 to -0.5 of the odevixibat group strongly supported better efficacy. Although the 
maximum proportional difference of 0.32 in favour of odevixibat was impressive, the two-sample 
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test failed to reject the null hypothesis; however, this result was unsurprising 
given the small number of data points in the maralixibat sample (n = 13).

Baseline pruritus severity score was similar for odevixibat and maralixibat with mean (SD) of 
2.94 (0.572) and 2.87 (0.534), respectively. At Week 22, a greater reduction from baseline in pruritus 
severity score was observed for odevixibat compared to maralixibat with LS mean changes from 
baseline of -1.76 and -1.49, respectively, and an LS mean difference of -0.27. 
Pruritus responder analyses were also conducted, assessing a ≥ 1-point reduction from baseline as 
conducted in the pivotal maralixibat study (Table 7; Figure 3). In this analysis, the percentage of 
patients achieving a ≥ 1-point reduction from baseline was higher for odevixibat compared to 
maralixibat with 81.8% (27 of 33) of odevixibat patients meeting this responder definition compared to 
58.3% (7 of 12) of maralixibat patients (odds ratio [95% CI]: 3.04 [0.70, 13.18]). Although the odds 
ratio was robust at 3.04 favouring odevixibat, the lower bound of the 95% CI was just below 1.0 
(at 0.7) indicating that the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1379). The difference 
would have been statistically significant if the maralixibat pivotal study had evaluated the same 
number of patients as the odevixibat study (n = 33), assuming a response rate of 58% similar to what 
was observed in the maralixibat study (Table 7) (chi-squared test p-value = 0.0321).

A post-hoc analysis of pruritus control, defined as the proportion of days with an ItchRO(Obs) AM score 
(representing nighttime scratching) of 0 or 1 in any given week, was conducted for maralixibat (EPAR, 
Section 2.6.5.2). This analysis was also conducted for odevixibat based on data from Study 
A4250-012. At Week 22, pruritus control was reported for a higher percent of days for patients who 
were receiving odevixibat in Study A4250-012 (mean [95% CI] 68.2% [53.1%, 83.4%]) compared to 
patients who were receiving maralixibat in Study LUM001-304 (mean 41.7%).  
The COMP concluded that although a trend for higher efficacy of Bylvay could be seen, no clear 
conclusions could be drawn based on the available data. The indirect comparison was hampered by the 
comparator product data (small sample size, different trial design). The Committee believed that even 
if the sponsor was to provide additional information on the MAIC (e.g. on effective sample sizes), it 
would unlikely change the conclusion that the efficacy seems to be similar for both products.  
Comparison of safety profiles to support a clinically relevant advantage 
In clinical development, odevixibat and maralixibat exhibited qualitatively similar safety profiles. 
However, the tolerability profile related to gastrointestinal adverse events was better for odevixibat 
relative to maralixibat as outlined in Table 8. During treatment with maralixibat, gastrointestinal

adverse events were noted in 71% of the 31 patients during the 18-week open-label period, including 
42% of patients with diarrhoea, 39% with abdominal pain, and 36% with vomiting, even using a dose 
titration scheme to reach the planned dose of 400 µg/kg/day. This is in contrast to the odevixibat 
study where, even over a considerably longer duration of treatment of 24 weeks, the overall incidence 
of gastrointestinal adverse events was much lower at 34% as was the incidence of diarrhoea (29%), 
abdominal pain (11%), and vomiting (6%). 
Additionally, there were no discontinuations due to adverse events during the 24-week treatment 
period in the odevixibat Study A4250-012, whereas in the maralixibat Study LUM001-304, 
discontinuations due to adverse events were reported in 2 patients in the 18-week run-in period, 
1 patient after the randomised withdrawal period, and 2 additional patients in the long-term extension 
[Gonzales 2021]. Following completion of Study A4250-012, 50 of 52 (96%) patients elected to enroll 
in the odevixibat long-term extension Study A4250-015, whereas 23 of 28 (82%) patients entered the 
long-term extension in the maralixibat Study LUM001-304.

Of note, odevixibat (invented name Bylvay) was authorised on 16 July 2021 for the treatment of 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged 6 months or older. In total, 
approximately 640 patients with cholestatic liver disease have been exposed to odevixibat to date 
during clinical development and post-marketing. No new safety signals have been detected and the 
positive benefit-risk balance has been confirmed in the last Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 
reporting period. Thus, the overall treatment experience of odevixibat is broader than that of 
maralixibat. The COMP noted that this additional post marketing data was not discussed in the 
comparison to maralixibat. 
The sponsor provided a naïve side-by-side comparison showing some AEs between placebo vs. 
Bylvav for the Bylvay trial until week 24 versus AEs for Livmarli during the 18-week run-in period (i.e. 
before initiation of the RWD and without a PBO control for this timeframe). 
This being a naïve comparison, there is no attempt to adjust for differences in trial populations and the 
COMP considered that the observed differences could be caused by differences in trial populations or 
conduct.  The lack of a placebo control for the chosen comparison from the Livmarli trial makes it 
difficult to interpret. In addition, there is the limitation of the relatively small sample sizes.  
The treatment duration for Bylvay is longer (24 vs 18 weeks) which in relation to the AEs observed in 
this timeframe should bias results in favour of Livmarli as AEs would only accrue with a longer 
exposure period. Setting aside all the afore mentioned limitations, the percentage of gastrointestinal 
AEs observed for Bylvay as compared to Livmarli looks smaller (34% vs 71%). However, due to the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 14/42 
 
 
 
very small number of patients this cannot be considered as convincing data in support of the significant 
benefit at this point in time. The COMP considered that additional safety data such as that in the PSUR 
the sponsor refers to should be included in the comparison to understand if indeed there is a clinically 
relevant difference between the two products regarding gastrointestinal adverse (GI) events. The 
sponsor should also not only look at the GI but a full comparison of all safety aspects of the two 
products will be required. 
Significant benefit based on a major contribution to patient care 
Improvement in sleep disturbance and daytime tiredness, and impact on quality of life 
Baseline data in the pivotal odevixibat study, A4250-012, showed that 61% of caregivers reported that 
disturbance in their child’s sleep was severe or very severe. As further evidence for the impact of sleep 
on QoL for patients with cholestatic liver disease, data collected during development of the Albireo 
clinical outcome assessment tools, the ObsRO and PRO instruments, sleep disturbance and fatigue 
were reported as the most bothersome features most commonly experienced by patients with ALGS 
and other cholestatic liver diseases. Sleep disturbance was mentioned by 92% of respondents and the 
average disturbance rating was 8.3 on a 0 to 10-point scale, where 10 indicates high levels of 
disturbance. Fatigue was reported in 69% of the interviews and the average disturbance rating was 
7.8. Sleep disturbance and fatigue were the only impacts reported by more than 50% of the 
respondents. Improving sleep deficits and the resulting daytime tiredness is a clinically important 
treatment goal in patients with ALGS. 
As highlighted in the results the odevixibat trial showed statistically significant improvements over 
placebo in sleep disturbance and tiredness; these improvements continued through the 24-week study 
and during longer-term treatment in the extension study. The improvement in sleep was confirmed by 
additional analyses on global symptom relief specifically related to sleep.  
To assess the relationship between improvements in sleep disturbance and QoL as assessed in the 
pivotal odevixibat study A4250-012, post hoc correlation analyses were conducted. Specifically, the 
changes from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 in the caregiver-reported sleep parameters and in changes 
in the PedsQL total score were evaluated. 
Figure 4 presents the results of the correlation analysis for changes to Weeks 12 and 24 in the PedsQL 
total score and the sleep parameters, percent of days with help falling asleep. As shown, 
improvements from baseline in the 2 parameters were moderately correlated with R = 0.6162 for 
Week 12 and R = 0.5145 for Week 24. Similar correlations were observed with PedsQL total score and 
other sleep parameters.  
The results from Study A4250-012 show that treatment with odevixibat led to statistically significant 
improvements over placebo in sleep disturbance and tiredness, and that sleep is correlated to the 
patients’ QoL. Sleep was not assessed as an endpoint in the maralixibat programme. For maralixibat, 
QoL was noted to improve during open-label treatment (mean [95% CI] change from baseline in 
PedsQL total score: 11 [4, 17]) but then declined considerably during the 4week period once the 
patients and caregivers were blinded to treatment (mean [95% CI] change during the RWD in PedsQL 
total score: 8 [17, 1]) [Gonzales 2021]. The sponsor considered that odevixibat showed a major 
contribution to patient care over maralixibat.

Patient impact 
An exit interview was conducted with caregivers to assess the impact of treatment on scratching and 
sleep. Results of this analysis showed that a statistically significantly higher proportion of caregivers of 
patients who received odevixibat reported meaningful improvements in the patient since the start of 
treatment (78.1%) compared to caregivers of patients who received placebo (26.7%) (p = 0.0009) 
(Figure 5).

According to the EPAR – public assessment report for Livmarli: “Improvement in the pruritus was 
accompanied with improvements in the quality of life, sleep and fatigue (mostly over the open-label 
long-term treatment period), which are also considered important favourable effects”. The fact that a 
particular endpoint or symptom was not captured in the Livmarli trial does not automatically mean that 
Livmarli would not have an effect on them.  
The COMP considered that the sponsor should further discuss the correlation between sleep quality and 
pruritus in the condition and justify the major contribution to patient care over Livmarli.  
In conclusion 
Based on the data submitted and the MACI, the COMP concluded that the Bylvay and Livmari appeared 
to have similar efficacy. Safety considerations require more safety data for both products as the naïve 
comparison was based on very small sample sizes form both trials. A comparison of the full safety 
profile is needed in order to discuss if there is a clinically relevant advantage based on any safety 
aspects. Finally, the COMP considered that additional discussion on the correlation between pruritus 
and sleep quality in the condition will be needed in order to justify a major contribution to patient care.   
4.  COMP list of issues 
Significant benefit 
It is known that establishing significant benefit based on safety generally requires convincing data from 
a sufficient number of patients and long follow-up period. The sponsor is requested to provide a 
comparison of the entire safety profile of Bylvay vs Livmarli and elaborate on the reasons to consider 
safety improvements as a clinically relevant advantage. Post-marketing surveillance data might be 
used in this comparison.   
If the sponsor cannot establish a clinically relevant advantage, then major contribution to patient care 
may be claimed. The claim of improvement on sleep as a major contribution to patient care should be 
further elaborated. It is noted that there is no comparator to assess the impact of this in the clinical 
setting on pruritus and sleep quality.  
Comments on sponsor’s response to the COMP list of issues 
The sponsor has provided a written response and presented their position at an oral explanation. The 
first point to be discussed was data to support the basis of a clinically relevant advantage. A safety 
comparison was submitted and presented. The methodology used for comparison of safety data 
focused on a statistical comparison of the incidence of adverse events between the Livmarli 18-week 
open label run-in phase and the Bylvay 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
(Table 9) as well as post marketing surveillance data (Table 10) with a focus on gastrointestinal 
disorders.   
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 17/42 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 9.  Incidence of adverse events between the Livmarli 18-week open label run-in phase and the 
Bylvay 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
Table 10.  Post marketing surveillance data with a focus on gastrointestinal disorders   
The sponsor has claimed in their presentation that there was a two-fold higher incidence of gastro-
intestinal adverse events for Livmarli when comparing the trials as well as a lower incidence of overall 
adverse-events for Bylvay. Additionally, the sponsor indicates that dose titrations were required for 
Livmarli due to lack of GI tolerability. It was highlighted that diarrhoea and vomiting were more 
important with Livmarli and that in paediatric patients this can lead to rapid dehydration and 
electrolyte imbalance.  
It was noted by the COMP that they have supplemented their descriptive initial naïve side-by-side 
comparisons with estimated risk differences and confidence intervals. However, those estimates 
remain naïve risk differences without an attempt to adjust for differences between trial populations. 
Hence, this is adding to the general uncertainties around the comparability of the safety events due to 
differences in study design – for Maralixibat coming from an open-label uncontrolled study phase, 
whereas for Odevixibat from a double-blind RCT. The Livmarli trial was not placebo controlled and had 
the added bias of including disease-specific GI effects. In addition, in Kamath B et al 2023 it was 
published that the majority of gastrointestinal adverse events occurred within the first 4 weeks of 
treatment and lasted less than a week, the majority of diarrhea and abdominal pain were mild to 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 18/42 
 
 
 
 
 
moderate in severity and transient in nature. There were no discontinuations for diarrhea with up to 
greater than 5 years of treatment with Livmarli. 
It was also noted that in the Livmarli SmPC for Alagille Syndrome that dose escalations were 
recommended. The starting dose is 40mcg/kg/day and it is stated that: Improvement in pruritus and 
reduction of serum bile acid levels may occur gradually in some patients after initiating odevixibat 
therapy. If an adequate clinical response has not been achieved after 3 months of continuous therapy, 
the dose may be increased to 120mcg/kg/day (see section 4.4). So, a level of dosing flexibility is 
evident and the sponsor’s argument regarding lowering the dose purely due to important adverse 
gastro-intestinal events appears to be negated by the recommendations on dose escalation.  
Post-marketing data has been also submitted and summarized above in Table 10. The sponsor claims 
that the postmarketing surveillance data shows substantially lower overall AEs and GI AEs reported as 
compared to Livmarli. 
The COMP noted that the post-marketing data on safety appeared to have been pooled from all 
available post-authorisation data on AEs which could be found. It was noted however that the big 
limitation and fully outside of the sponsor’s control was that the comparator product was approved 
very recently and there is little data. In addition, it was noted that due to the conditions being different 
PFIC for Bylvay and Alagille Syndrome for Livmarli the difference in dosing could have had an effect on 
the reporting rates.  
The COMP described in the table below some of the challenges regarding the dosing and collection of 
adverse events.  
Table 11.  Posology of Bylvay for Alagille Syndrome 
The COMP noted the difference in the number of Bylvay capsules needed to achieve the recommended 
dose of Livmarli and requested that the sponsor further elaborate on how the safety data compared at 
the time of collection noting the incidence of GI AEs in patients taking 120mcg/kg/day had not been 
addressed. The sponsor was unable to provide an adequate response to the question. It was 
considered that in the post marketing data there was therefore an important dose bias, i.e. the 
recommended dose for PFIC patients is 40mcg/kg/day (with the possibility of dose escalation up to 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 19/42 
 
 
 
 
 
120mcg/kg/day, if an adequate clinical response has not been achieved after 3 months of continuous 
therapy), while the recommended dose for Alagile syndrome is 120mcg/kg/day (with the option of 
dose reduction to 40 mcg/kg/day if tolerability issues occur in the absence of other causes). This could 
be driven by the different indications for the two products.  
It was therefore concluded that the argument on an improved safety profile does not appear to be 
strong enough as the indirect comparison between the two studies are not matched and that the post 
marketing data has not been considered sufficiently compelling due to potential differences in doses 
used of Bylvay and Livmarli making comparability difficult to ascertain (i.e. the equipotent dosing is 
unknown). It was also noted that diarrhoea is associated with the condition and is associated with the 
bile acid secretion. No clinically relevant advantage could be established based on safety.  
As a clinically relevant advantage could not be established by the sponsor and efficacy and safety 
between the products was considered equivalent, major contribution to patient care was discussed.  
The sponsor has again compared the Bylvay Phase III study where sleep was a pre-specified endpoint, 
sleep disturbance and tiredness were evaluated with a validated PRO instrument and sleep was 
evaluated twice daily for the entire 24-week trial period. It is highlighted that Livmarli trial did not 
include sleep as a pre-specified endpoint, no sleep-specific instrument was used and only PedsQL 
generic score & Fatigue scale items were collected. They argue that in this instrument fatigue is not a 
direct measure of sleep disturbance and it is measured at baseline and 3 other timepoints over 
48weeks.  
Table 12.  Bylvay Phase III study: evaluation of sleep disturbance and tiredness with dedicated 
PRO/ObsRO instrument 
They also propose that the effect of Bylvay on sleep is not only due to its effect on pruritus. It is 
claimed that there is a lack of strong correlation between improvements in sleep disturbance and 
pruritus and pruritus responders and nonresponders to Bylvay have improvements in sleep. It is 
further claimed that the mechanism of sleep disturbance in chronic liver disease is not fully understood 
and is likely multifactorial (Shah, 2020).

fatigue in pruritus responders only 
Figure 7.  Patient and Caregiver Response in Exit Interviews of Bylvay Study Demonstrate that 
Improvement in Sleep Improves Quality of Life 
The sponsor concludes that treatment with Bylvay led to a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful improvement in sleep disturbance and tiredness because it was measured as an 
independent assessment with a validated instrument, improvements were observed in both pruritis 
responders and nonresponders and improvements in sleep disturbance correlated with improvement in 
QoL. They note that sleep was not assessed as an endpoint in the Livmarli study, no evidence that 
treatment with Livmarli would have a clinically meaningful and statistically significant impact on sleep; 
Fatigue is not equal to sleep. They also argue that extrapolation of improvement of sleep based on 
effects on pruritus is not supported.  
The COMP noted that a comparison between two trials which are not matched has been made. This 
leads to methodological issues already highlighted to the sponsor in the initial evaluation regarding this 
unbalanced and unmatched indirect comparison which have not been addressed adequately. It was 
noted that the assumption that the comparison between responders and nonresponders in the Bylvay

trial was statistically robust was questionable as the nonresponder group consisted of only 7 patients 
while the responders had 28.

Received Odevixibat by Pruritus Responder Status (Full Analysis Set, Study A4250-012)

The COMP however noted that a similar impact was reported in the public domain for Livmarli as 
presented in the graph below from a publication by Kamath et al J Pediatr 2023;252:68-75. The 
follow-up time was double that in the Bylvay study. (48weeks to 24weeks) The COMP questioned if the 
comparison was enough to establish major contribution to patient care.  
The sponsor also just focuses on the naïve comparison of the two trials without considering what is 
published in the public domain.  
It was also noted that the EPAR and OMAR for Livmarli discussed the improvements in quality of life, 
sleep and fatigue. In the OMAR a statistically significant reduction (improvement) in morning 
EDQ(Obs) sleep disturbance score between baseline and the average of weeks 15-26 and in PedsQL 
(Parent) multidimensional fatigue scale score between baseline and the average of weeks 18, 22 and 
26 in the maralixibat group compared to placebo was reported.  
The COMP noted the small number of patients in the non-responder group (7) in the Bylvay group and 
questioned the significance of the comparison with the responders (28) from study A4250-012 
regarding the quality of the sleep. In addition, it was noted that the comparison between the major 
contribution to patient care regarding sleep trended more towards similarity for the two products 
although the methods used for measurement were different. The COMP could therefore not establish if 
the impact on sleep for Bylvay was indeed a significant major contribution to patient care when 
compared to Livmarli. 
The COMP concluded they could not recommend maintaining the orphan designation and thus the 10-
year market exclusivity for Bylvay in Alagille Syndrome.

5.  COMP position adopted on 31 July 2023 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of Alagille syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.3 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to severe pruritus, cholestasis, liver 
failure, and congenital cardiac defects. Life expectancy is in most cases around 20 years and death 
is associated with blood vessel abnormalities, cardiac failure and end-stage liver disease; 
in view of the fact that a satisfactory method for the treatment of the condition has been 
authorised in the European Union (Livmarli), the existence of significant benefit over the authorised 
method of treatment should be established at the stage of the granting of marketing authorisation;  
the sponsor’s claim that Bylvay is of significant benefit to those affected by the orphan condition 
does not hold. Significant benefit over Livmarli was claimed on the grounds of a clinically relevant 
advantage as well as a major contribution to patient care; 
the sponsor did not provide enough data to establish a clinically relevant advantage over Livmarli: 
− 
− 
the products are deemed to have similar efficacy profiles, and differences noted by sponsor are 
not significant. Furthermore, sponsor's conclusions are hampered by MAIC issues; 
in regard to safety, the products have shown similar safety profiles, and claims by the sponsor 
on significant differences are likewise hampered by the lack of robust data, biases and further 
relevant differences (e.g. dosing), etc; 
• 
the sponsor did not provide enough data to demonstrate a MCPC in comparison to Livmarli. While 
the sponsor claims improvement of sleep, the same sponsor recognises that it has not provided 
data for Livmarli for the comparison, even though available data shows Livmarli is also beneficial 
for sleep. Furthermore, QoL data suggest similar effects, without any significant differences. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are not satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Bylvay, (2S)-2-{[(2R)-2-
[({[3,3-dibutyl-7-(methylthio)-1,1-dioxido-5-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro- 1,2,5-benzothiadiazepin-8-
yl]oxy}acetyl)amino]-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl]amino}butanoic acid, odevixibat for treatment of 
Alagille syndrome (EU/3/12/1040) is removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal 
Products.

6.  Appeal to the negative opinion adopted on 31 July 2023 
Grounds for appeal 
The sponsor presented detailed grounds for appeal (EMA/OD/0000152080) on 15 September 2023.  
Please refer to the sponsor’s appeal documents in the case Input from Industry folder. 
The detailed grounds for appeal were further addressed by the sponsor at an oral explanation before the 
COMP on 3 October 2023. 
Comments on the grounds of appeal 
The appeal grounds pertain to significant benefit claims of a clinically relevant advantage (i.e. 
improved efficacy and improved safety), as well as to a claim on a major contribution to patient care 
(MCPC). While these general claims have already been made during the initial submission, the sponsor 
presents new analyses as well as clarifications on certain aspects. The sponsor emphasizes that 
although the designs of the maralixibat and odevixibat registrational studies were different, a valid 
comparison was made by considering and adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics and other 
parameters that could bias the interpretation of the data. In addition, new analyses with longer term 
odevixibat treatment data are presented, including from the uncontrolled open-label extension study 
A4250-015.  
In order to evaluate the significant benefit of odevixibat compared to maralixibat, a comparison was 
made of the publicly available results from Study LUM001-304, the primary study supporting the 
authorisation of maralixibat in ALGS, and the pivotal odevixibat study and its extension study, A4250-
012 and Study A4250-015, respectively. Additional evidence was derived from a comparison of the 
safety profile of the 2 products from the placebo-controlled maralixibat Studies LUM001-301 and 
LUM001-303 with the placebo-controlled odevixibat Study A4250-012 and long-term safety data from 
maralixibat extension studies (LUM001-303 and LUM-001-305) and odevixibat study A4250-015. A 
comparison of post-marketing safety data from the FDA from both products is also included. 
For the unanchored indirect adjusted and naïve comparisons presented by the sponsor, updated long-
term exposure data for odevixibat have been obtained through a data cutoff date of 17 July 2023. 
Based on the new data cutoff date, 42 patients have now received odevixibat for ≥48 weeks through 
the pivotal study A4250-012 and the open-label extension study A4250-015. The sponsor considers 
that the re-assessment of the baseline characteristics using the larger sample size for odevixibat based 
on the updated data confirmed that the patient populations were similar across the studies. This 
argument is based on descriptively comparing the baseline characteristics of all patients from the 
pivotal and supportive odevixibat and maralixibit studies (Table 15).

changes are from start of the randomized withdrawal period (end of Week 18), not baseline. 
The sponsor further clarified that pharmacodynamic analyses confirmed that the doses studied in the 
registrational maralixibat (400 µg/kg/day) and odevixibat (120 µg/kg/day) studies were 
therapeutically equivalent, and that odevixibat is 4 to 10 times more potent than maralixibat and 
appears to be more efficient at reaching the IBAT target in the distal ileum, resulting in a lower drug 
burden. 
6.1.    Efficacy 
The sponsor supports their claim for improved efficacy of Bylvay vis a vis Livmarli by the totality of 
data on QoL, pruritus severity, and serum bile acids from new analyses of patients who received at 
least 48 weeks of treatment with maralixibat or odevixibat. A regression-adjusted matching approach 
was chosen for the unanchored indirect comparisons between the pooled data from the odevixibat 
Studies A4250-012 and A4250-015 and the publicly available maralixibat data [Gonzales 2019, 
Gonzales 2021, Kamath 2023, Shneider 2018, Shneider 2022, maralixibat EPAR, the public version of 
the maralixibat OMAR, maralixibat FDA integrated review, clinicaltrials.gov, FDAERS].  
6.1.1.    Improvement in quality of life 
6.1.1.1.    Results of the indirect weighted adjusted comparisons 
The sponsor conducted unanchored indirect comparisons of QoL based on the PedsQL total score for 
patients who received at least 48 weeks of treatment with maralixibat in Study LUM001-304 or 
odevixibat in Studies A4250-012/A4250-015. A regression-adjusted weighted estimator method was 
used for comparison of these data. The sponsor had initially considered performing a MAIC including 
baseline PedsQL in the weighting which however resulted in a very small effective sample size (ESS) 
with many odevixibat patients assigned a small weight for all outcomes. Consequently, for the QoL 
analysis, 4 baseline covariates were included in the MAIC (age, sex, AM scratching score, and serum

bile acid levels) and for the regression analysis, baseline PedsQL total score was additionally included 
as a covariate. 
Table 17 provides the ESS and the unadjusted and adjusted baseline characteristics following 
propensity score weighting (MAIC) for QoL analyses.

A summary of the unanchored regression-adjusted matched comparisons of changes from baseline to 
Week 48 in the QoL parameters is provided in Table 18. As shown, treatment with odevixibat led to a 
statistically significantly greater improvement in the PedsQL total score after 48 weeks of treatment 
compared to maralixibat. The mean weighted adjusted difference was 14.47 and the lower bound of 
the 95% CI was greater than zero (5.56, 23.38).

The statistically significant improvement in the PedsQL total score is deemed clinically relevant by the 
sponsor. Given that the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the PedsQL total score is 4.5 
points [Varni 2003], this difference of 14.5 points in favour of odevixibat is >3x the magnitude of 
change that patients perceive as beneficial and the lower bound of the 95% CI exceeded the MCID. 
The sponsor also emphasizes that indirect naïve comparisons over time showed improvements in QoL 
throughout both the blinded (A4250-012) and open-label (A4250-015) treatment with odevixibat while 
for maralixibat the initial improvement in QoL during the 18-week open-label treatment period in Study

LUM001-304, QoL declined substantially once patients were transitioned to blinded treatment in the 
short 4-week randomised withdrawal (RWD) period. QoL then improved through Week 48 upon return 
to open-label treatment with maralixibat.  
6.1.2.    Improvement in pruritus and serum bile acids 
6.1.2.1.    Results of the indirect weighted adjusted comparisons 
Indirect weighted adjusted analyses for the key efficacy results for the pruritus and serum bile acid 
endpoints from the maralixibat LUM001-304 study with comparable data from the odevixibat A4250-
012/A4250-015 studies were conducted for patients who received at least 48 weeks of treatment with 
maralixibat or odevixibat. The sponsor had initially considered performing a MAIC including baseline 
total bilirubin in the weighting which however resulted in a very small ESS with many odevixibat 
patients assigned a small weight for all outcomes. Consequently, a regression-adjusted matching 
method was used for comparison of these data (Table 19). For the pruritus analyses, 4 baseline 
covariates were included in both the MAIC and the regression analysis (age, sex, AM scratching score, 
and serum bile acid levels). For serum bile acids, the same 4 factors were included in the MAIC and the 
regression analysis; baseline total bilirubin was additionally included as a covariate in the regression 
analysis.

6.1.3.    Efficacy Conclusions MAH 
Treatment with odevixibat led to a statistically significantly greater improvement in PedsQL total score 
after 48 weeks of treatment compared to maralixibat. The substantially greater mean difference 
favouring odevixibat over maralixibat represents a significant benefit for patients with ALGS as the 
PedsQL total score assesses multiple aspects of a patient’s life and overall well-being. 
All pruritus and serum bile acid analyses conducted for patients who received at least 48 weeks of 
treatment with odevixibat demonstrated consistently stronger effects for improvement in these 
endpoints as compared to maralixibat. The sponsor states that the probability that all tested 
parameters favour odevixibat over maralixibat by chance is extremely low, and that small sample sizes 
are often a reality in rare diseases due to the limited patient population. 
6.1.4.  Efficacy Conclusions COMP  
To substantiate their claim of significant benefit, the sponsor is presenting results from unanchored 
regression-adjusted matched comparisons. It is acknowledged that the unanchored comparisons are 
motivated by the substantial differences in study designs underlying the odevixibat and the maralixibat 
applications: odevixibat was investigated in a placebo (PBO) controlled RCT for 24 weeks before 
transitioning to the open-label phase; maralixibat was investigated in an uncontrolled study with a 4-
week PBO controlled randomised withdrawal phase. Nevertheless, the validity of these unanchored 
comparisons relies on the strong assumption that all relevant prognostic and predictive variables are 
accounted for in the model. This limitation is also acknowledged by the sponsor. Consequently, results 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 30/42 
 
 
 
would need to be particularly compelling (and reliable) to robustly establish that observed differences 
are truly caused by a difference in QoL/efficacy (or safety) and pharmacodynamics of the underlying 
treatment and not e.g. by differences in study populations or study designs/treatment regimens. 
The comparison relies on pooled data across odevixibat studies A4250-012/-015, i.e. with a fraction of 
patients starting odevixibat treatment within the pivotal study A4250-012 and a fraction of patients 
starting odevixibat treatment within the open-label extension study A4250-015. In their position the 
sponsor did not provide information about the number of patients starting odevixibat treatment per 
study which is adding to uncertainty about the origin of the data contributing to this comparison. 
In addition, the sponsor presents again indirect naïve comparisons on the PedsQL total score over time 
including the data for maralixibat reported in the Gonzales 2021 paper. QoL data (PedsQL total score): 
Besides pruritus and sBAs, the sponsor now also includes QoL data (PedsQL total score) to support 
their claim of significant benefit due to improved efficacy. 
Further to the above, the COMP noted that it is very challenging to compare QoL outcomes across 
studies, as external factors such as study design and other study related factors can largely influence 
the outcomes of this important, but subjective, outcome parameter. Performing a MAIC including 
baseline PedsQL total score in the weighting resulted in a very small ESS with many odevixibat 
patients assigned a small weight for all outcomes, which could also be attributed to differences 
between the studies. 
Importantly, the COMP pointed out that patients treated with Bylvay had similar improvement from 
baseline in the PedsQL total score as patients treated with placebo in the randomised pivotal study 
A4250-012. No statistically significant treatment effect was demonstrated, and the study failed to meet 
this particular endpoint. A positive trend towards an improved PedsQL total score is not reflected in the 
SmPC for Bylvay either. This questions whether conclusions could be drawn regarding relative efficacy 
versus other studies and products.  
For Livmarli, after an initial improvement in the open-label titration phase, the randomised withdrawal 
phase had a negative impact both on PedsQL in the active treatment and placebo group. Thus, the 
design of the study did impact how patients and their caregivers perceive QoL, both for placebo 
and active treatment. This raises additional concerns over the validity of such unanchored cross study 
comparisons of this particular endpoint. There is also a risk for bias for the PedsQL comparison at week 
48 due to the randomised withdrawal phase (see also discussion below). 
Among the 52 patients enrolled in the pivotal odevixibat trial, 42 patients received at least 48 weeks of 
treatment with odevixibat across the pivotal and open-label extension studies (A4250-012/-015). 
Among those 42 patients QoL data was available for 30 patients only (Table 17). For maralixibat, QoL 
data at week 48 was available for 27 out of 31 patients enrolled in the pivotal phase 2 trial (Table 17). 
The COMP further pointed out that this represents a "loss" of 27% of patients in QoL data for 
odevixibat while 13%, half of the loss, was presented for maralixibat. The sponsor did not list reasons 
for why QoL data was missing for either product, which poses a limitation to the interpretation of the 
results. In particular, the results could be biased in case QoL data are not missing at random. This 
point could also not be sufficiently clarified during the oral hearing. Reference is made to the EMA 
Guideline on Missing Data in Confirmatory Clinical Trials (available at: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/guideline-missing-data-confirmatory-
clinical-trials_en.pdf).  
Furthermore, it is understood that the 27 patients with QoL outcome data from the pivotal maralixibat 
study LUM001-304 comprises patients who constantly received maralixibat for 48 weeks as well as 
patients who received PBO for 4 weeks during the randomised withdrawal period. There is a risk that 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 31/42 
 
 
 
the patients who received PBO treatment for 4 weeks will have worse QoL outcomes as compared to 
patients who were constantly on active treatment, which would unduly favour odevixibat over 
maralixibat in the indirect comparison. The sponsor does not comment on this risk for bias. 
Considering all the above, the COMP did not consider the entirety of QoL data as presented by the 
sponsor as evidence sufficient for establishing a claim for improved efficacy of odevixibat over 
maralixibat. 
Pruritus and Serum Bile Acids data: 
While the COMP noted that in general the missing data in these analyses are less severe, the general 
issue as regards the high level of uncertainty due to the unanchored cross study comparisons still 
remains (see discussion above). Furthermore, the committee questioned the clinical relevance of some 
of the observed differences, e.g. the reported numeric difference of -16 µmol/L in sBA levels, with 
broad confidence intervals also indicating that the "true" effect may be the opposite. 
The observed effects in mean changes from baseline were not of statistical significance and, in 
addition, there was uncertainty about the quantification of the effect size due to risk for bias and wide 
confidence intervals (small precision). 
Moreover, Alagille syndrome is a heterogenous disease, and it is not certain from the submitted 
analyses whether all prognostic factors were adjusted for. 
Considering the above, the COMP did not consider that the data presented by the sponsor (including, 
in their totality) could demonstrate an improved efficacy of Bylvay vis-à-vis Livmarli.   
6.2.    Safety 
The following sections provide a comparison of the safety profiles of odevixibat and maralixibat based 
on data from clinical trials and available post-marketing information. 
6.2.1.    Clinical trial data 
6.2.1.1.    Safety analyses  
The sponsor presents data from new safety analyses, an indirect weighted adjusted analyses as well as 
naïve comparisons. The sponsor expects that the new safety analyses address the concerns raised 
previously by the COMP, i.e. differences in treatment duration (18 weeks with maralixibat and 24 
weeks with odevixibat) as well as potential reporting bias in the comparison of open-label data 
(maralixibat) with placebo-controlled data (odevixibat).  
6.2.1.2.    Results of the regression-adjusted matched indirect comparisons for safety 
Regression-adjusted matched indirect comparisons for safety analyses were conducted based on 2 sets 
of data during open-label treatment as there are only limited (4-week) placebo-controlled data for 
maralixibat at the approved therapeutic dose, precluding meaningful comparisons. The comparisons 
were conducted based on: 1) open-label treatment during the initial 18 weeks of treatment with each 
compound, and 2) after the 4-week placebo-controlled RWD period (Weeks 23 to 48) in Study 
LUM001-304 for maralixibat and after the 24-week placebo-controlled period in Study A4250-012 for 
odevixibat (i.e. during Study A4250-015).  
Table 21 provides the ESS and the unadjusted and adjusted baseline characteristics following 
propensity score weighting (MAIC) for sex, AM scratching score, and serum bile acid levels for the 18-
week analysis. Results were consistent for the Weeks 23/24-48 analysis (data not shown).

According to the sponsor’s analysis of GI TEAEs and SAEs over the initial 18 weeks of open-label 
treatment with maralixibat and odevixibat, all regression-adjusted matched comparisons for GI 
disorders, including the overall incidence as well as the incidence of diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and 
vomiting, were in favour of odevixibat showing lower incidence of these AEs (Table 22). Results were 
similar for the Week 23/24 to Week 48 analyses (data not shown).

for odevixibat in Study A4250-012 were also done. The sponsor emphasizes that even with lower 
(subtherapeutic) doses of maralixibat (≤280 µg/kg/day) than used in Study LUM001-304 
(400 µg/kg/day), the incidence of GI side effects, including diarrhoea (43.6% vs 22.9%), abdominal 
pain (25.6% vs 5.7%), and vomiting (10.3% vs 5.7%), were 2 to 4 times higher during 13 weeks of 
treatment with maralixibat compared to 13 weeks of treatment with odevixibat at 120 µg/kg/day 
(Table 23).  
It is also noted that bleeding events were reported in these short-term placebo-controlled studies with 
maralixibat, including epistaxis in 2 patients and haematemesis in 1 patient; these types of events 
were not reported during the initial 13-weeks of treatment with odevixibat in Study A4250-012. 
Further, there has been a higher reported rate of serious bleeding events during long-term treatment 
with maralixibat compared to odevixibat. 
The overall results and the incidence of common GI TEAEs for the above analysis were compared 
statistically; results are provided in Table 23. The overall rate of TEAEs and the rate of abdominal pain 
were statistically significantly lower for patients who received blinded odevixibat for 13 weeks 
compared to patients who received blinded maralixibat for 13 weeks, as evidenced by the 95% CIs 
excluding 0.

Comparison of SAEs, including clinically significant SAEs of haemorrhages and fractures, 
during long-term treatment with maralixibat and with odevixibat. 
The sponsor also summarises the overall incidence of SAEs with maralixibat than with odevixibat 
during long term treatment and the incidence of haemorrhage events based on the MedDRA 
Haemorrhages SMQ and reports of fracture during long-term treatment with odevixibat across Studies 
A4250-012 and A4250-015 and long-term treatment with maralixibat based on pooled analyses across 
Studies LUM001-303, LUM001-304, and LUM001-305. This comparison showed more reports of SAEs 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

of haemorrhage-type events and of fractures during treatment with maralixibat. Overall, SAE Incidence 
for odevixibat (pooled A4250-012/015; N=50) was 12 (23.1%) and for maralixibat (pooled LUM001-
303/304/305; N=84) it was 25 (29.8%). How many of these reported SAEs were judged as being 
treatment-related by the investigators was not clear. These data are consistent with what has also 
been observed in review of post-marketing data.  
Discontinuation of treatment due to AEs over the course of long-term treatment was higher 
for maralixibat than for odevixibat 
Furthermore, the sponsor compared the discontinuation rates between the 2 treatments. An analysis of 
long-term treatment with odevixibat across the two phase 3 Studies A4250-012 and A4250-015 (n=50 
total) and across the 5 phase 2 Studies LUM001-301, -302, -303, -304, and LUM001-305 (n=84 total) 
was performed. Overall, a discontinuation rate due to TEAEs of 10.7% was reported for maralixibat 
and of 2% for odevixibat. 
6.2.2.    Post-marketing surveillance data 
The sponsor presents again the side-by-side comparisons of safety data for maralixibat and odevixibat, 
based on post-marketing surveillance data derived from a search of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting 
System (FAERS). In this data-base 600 patients suffering from ALGS treated with maralixibat and 423 
patients suffering from PFIC treated with odevixibat were included. The data on the GI related adverse 
events are the same as compared to the data already submitted by the sponsor and evaluated by the 
COMP previously (see above Table 10). In addition, the sponsor has now also submitted information on 
adverse events relating to haemorrhage and fracture suggesting a possibly increased rate for 
Livmarli/maralixibat compared to Bylvay/odevixibat.  
The COMP has previously concluded that the post-marketing data cannot be considered sufficiently 
compelling due to difficulties in the comparability of the safety profile of odevixibat in patients with 
PFIC and those with ALGS and due to potential differences in doses used of Bylvay (40-120 mg for the 
PFIC indication versus 120 mg for the ALGS indication), making comparability difficult to ascertain. It 
was also noted by the COMP that diarrhoea is associated with the condition and is associated with the 
bile acid secretion.  The sponsor now compared the TEAE rate of odevixibat pivotal studies in PFIC and 
ALGS, both were 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Study A4250-005 
randomised 62 patients with PFIC to 2 dose levels of odevixibat (40 and 120 µg/kg/day) and placebo. 
As noted above, Study A4250-012 randomised 52 patients with ALGS to odevixibat 120 µg/kg/day and 
placebo. The overall incidence of TEAEs was 83.3% for the 42 patients with PFIC who received 
odevixibat in Study A4250-005 and 74.3% for the 35 patients with ALGS who received odevixibat in 
Study A4250-012. As well, the overall incidence of TEAEs was similar for PFIC patients who received 
the 40 and 120 µg/kg/day dose of odevixibat (82.6% and 84.2%, respectively). The sponsor therefore 
concludes that the safety profile of odevixibat in patients with PFIC and those with ALGS is 
comparable.  
6.2.3.  Mechanistic data and impact for patients 
In addition, the sponsor now presents detailed arguments on the fact that possible differences in 
incidence of GI AEs may be explained mechanistically. While Bylvay and Livmarli both act by inhibiting 
the intestinal bile acid transporter, the impact on individual bile acids might be different. Increased 
levels of circulating unconjugated bile acids (CDCA, LCA, CA, DCA) were observed after 72 weeks 
treatment with maralixibat which are known to stimulate gut motility and colonic secretion leading to 
diarrhoea, abdominal pain and vomiting. This increase in unconjugated bile acids was not observed in 
patients exposed to odevixibat, as measured at Week 24 (where the levels remained below LoQ), Table 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 35/42 
 
 
 
24. The sponsor further emphasized the importance to ALGS patients of a new medicinal product with 
improved tolerability in view of the fact that many of patients already contend with underlying GI 
abnormalities and are at risk of cascading effects on overall health/morbidity due to additional effects 
in this regard.   
Table 24.  Important Differences in Downstream Effects of Bylvay Provide Foundation for Better Safety 
Profile 
CA: cholic acid, CDCA: chenodeoxycholic acid, DCA: deoxycholic acid, LCA: lithocholic acid 
6.2.4.    Safety Conclusions MAH 
Odevixibat's safety and tolerability profile stands out as superior when juxtaposed with maralixibat, 
based on several key findings: 
1. 
Lower incidence of AEs: Odevixibat demonstrates a statistically significantly lower incidence of 
GI side effects and a statistically significantly lower incidence of vomiting and abdominal pain 
compared to maralixibat in the matched analyses. Such differences in incidence of GI AEs may 
be explained mechanistically by the very high levels of circulating unconjugated bile acids 
observed after treatment with maralixibat. 
2. 
3. 
Fewer discontinuations indicating better tolerability: The reduced rate of treatment 
discontinuations due to AEs with odevixibat underscores its better overall tolerability. 
Post-marketing data consistency: The post-marketing data further corroborates the safety 
profile of odevixibat, emphasizing its lower overall incidence of AEs, especially GI side effects, 
compared to maralixibat. 
6.2.5.   Safety Conclusions COMP 
With regard to the newly presented unanchored regression-adjusted MAIC analysis the COMP noted 
that there were several methodological uncertainties which did not allow to establish the existence of a 
significant difference in the safety profiles between Bylvay and Livmarli. These uncertainties related to 
(i) the assumptions underlying the unanchored regression-adjusted comparison, (ii) the small sample 
size and very small effective sample size (which contributed to age not being included in the propensity 
score matching and non-convergence of the full regression model for diarrhoea), and (iii) uncertainty 
over the relevance of the matched parameters for safety comparisons (sex, baseline pruritus score and 
sBA).  
An unanchored comparison relies on the strong assumption that all effect modifiers and prognostic 
factors are accounted for in the model. The sponsor has not convincingly justified and demonstrated 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 36/42 
 
 
 
 
that observed differences can truly be attributed to a difference in treatment and are not caused by 
bias. 
Furthermore, for establishing drug safety, all available clinical data should be taken into account, and 
therefore the restriction of the sample size for the purposes of matching is not understood.  
The COMP noted that Alagille Syndrome itself is associated with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. This is 
for example shown by the relatively high rate of diarrhoea events (44.4%) and the rate of abdominal 
pain (16.7%) in the placebo arms of the 13-week placebo-controlled studies with Livmarli at low-doses 
(LUM001-301 and LUM001-302). Therefore, the placebo response and background incidence of GI 
disease symptoms should be taken into consideration as well in the indirect comparisons among study 
populations.  
With regard to the naïve unadjusted indirect comparison of AE incidence over 13 weeks from placebo-
controlled data for maralixibat in Studies LUM001-301 and LUM001-302 and for odevixibat in Study 
A4250-012, the higher rates of diarrhoea and abdominal pain for maralixibat may possibly be 
explained by differences in the study populations of these trials. Comparing the event rates in the 
respective placebo arms, diarrhoea events and abdominal pain in the pooled LUM001-301/302 placebo 
arms were reported to be 44.4% and 16.7% respectively while this was much lower for the placebo 
arm of study A4250-012 with only 5.9% for each, the diarrhoea events and abdominal pain rate 
(Livmarli EPAR and Bylvay CHMP AR). In the Livmarli EPAR it is stated that the incidence of events of 
diarrhoea in the overall maralixibat and placebo groups of studies LUM001-301 and LUM001-302 were 
similar (43.6% vs. 44.4% of participants, respectively), while events of abdominal pain were slightly 
reported more rarely in the placebo groups versus maralixibat (16.7% vs 25.6%, respectively). 
However, the majority of these adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, transient in nature, 
and resolved with no action taken. 
The pharmacological rationale presented to explain the possible difference in gastro-intestinal side 
effects was based on data sets which were difficult to compare. The analyses of the secondary 
unconjugated bile acids for Livmarli were performed after 72 weeks of treatment, whereas this was 
after 24 weeks for Bylvay. Also, for Bylvay some changes from baseline were observed after shorter 
term drug exposure, albeit minimal. A direct comparison is considered hampered by the differences in 
drug exposure time. Also, Alagille syndrome is a heterogenous disease which may in itself be 
associated with gastro-intestinal symptoms.      
With regard to the selected serious adverse events (SAE) differences as presented by the sponsor, the 
COMP noted that fractures and severe haemorrhages due to vascular abnormalities are well-known and 
common disease complications (Circulation. 2004;109:1354-1358, Kamath BM et al.,. J Pediatr Gastroenterol 
Nutr. 2018;67(2):148e156). As it can also be readily inferred from the EPAR of Livmarli, such SAEs were 
not considered to be treatment related.  
With regard to the reported differences in discontinuations the COMP noted that (also by reference to 
the EPAR) the reasons for discontinuation for maralixibat were possibly drug related for 6 cases in the 
pooled safety dataset, mainly due to increments of liver function tests. For both products, however, it 
was considered (also by the CHMP) that there is a potential risk of hepatotoxicity, to be further 
investigated post-marketing. There were no discontinuations due to GI AE for Livmarli. 
With regard to the post-marketing surveillance data in combination with the additional analyses and 
conclusions that the overall incidence of TEAEs with odevixibat in patients with PFIC and with ALGS is 
similar, the COMP pointed out that besides differences in disorders, the dose recommendation of 
Bylvay is in a lower range for PFIC than for ALGS. This hampers a direct comparison of the databases.  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000123138 
Page 37/42 
 
 
 
Further to the above, the COMP considered that the submitted analyses could not establish a claim of 
better safety or tolerability of Bylvay over Livmarli.   
6.3.  Major contribution to patient care (improvement in sleep disturbance and 
QoL) 
In order to substantiate their claim for a major contribution to patient care of Bylvay vis a vis Livmarli, 
the sponsor provides further analyses to demonstrate that improvement in pruritus was not the sole 
driver for improvement in sleep during treatment with odevixibat. In this regard the results from two 
new analyses were presented: 1) a correlation analysis to evaluate the relationship between 
improvements in pruritus and improvements in sleep and 2) a statistical model (MMRM) that factors 
out the impact of the change in pruritus in the assessment of changes in sleep.  
1)  Correlation analyses based on Pearson correlation coefficients were conducted between changes 
from baseline in the sleep disturbance assessments (tiredness, help falling asleep, awakenings, and 
days soothing, sleeping with caregiver, and taking medications) and scratching score to Weeks 21-24 
in Study A4250-012 and to Weeks 45-48 across the pooled analyses for Studies A4250-012 and 
A4250-015. Only a modest correlation between sleep and pruritus was seen at both the Weeks 21-24 
and 45-48 analyses (correlation coefficient: 0.2838 and 0.2495, respectively).  
2) As previously described, in the primary MMRM analysis, odevixibat led to statistically significant 
improvements in 4 of the key sleep parameters, including percent of days with help falling asleep, with 
soothing, and with sleeping with the caregiver, as well as daytime tiredness (see above Table 12). 
After factoring out improvement in pruritus, 3 of the 4 key sleep parameters still showed that 
odevixibat significantly improved sleep compared to placebo – indicating that although pruritus does 
play a role in sleep improvement (as evidenced by the smaller LS mean differences between odevixibat 
and placebo), it is not the sole driver for the results observed (see below Table 25).

The sponsor also emphasized again that improvement in sleep disturbance was observed in pruritus 
responders and in non-responders of odevixibat. In contrast, data with maralixibat did suggest a 
possible correlation between pruritus and sleep, i.e. data from the PedsQL multidimensional fatigue 
scale scores and for the trouble sleeping subscore from the emotional domain of the PedsQL reported 
in the Kamath et al., 2023 publication showed that patients who did not achieve a reduction in 
scratching score ≥1 had worsening of sleep parameters based on the multidimensional fatigue scale 
[Table VII, Kamath 2023].  
Furthermore, the sponsor refers again the data from the regression-adjusted matched comparison of 
changes from baseline to Week 48 in the QoL parameters showing a statistically significant greater 
improvement in the PedsQL total score achieved with Bylvay, as compared to Livmarli. This data has 
been discussed in detail above and was used by the sponsor to substantiate their claim for improved 
efficacy. 
6.3.1.  MCPC Conclusions by MAH  
The correlation analyses between sleep improvement and pruritus revealed weak to moderate 
correlations, suggesting that odevixibat's impact on sleep isn't entirely pruritus dependent. 
Furthermore, statistical analyses that factored out pruritus improvement still showed odevixibat's 
significant benefits on sleep. This was further corroborated by the observation that both pruritus 
responders and non-responders exhibited improvements in sleep parameters when treated with 
odevixibat.  
6.3.2.  MCPC Conclusions COMP 
The sponsor claims that Bylvay improves sleep as compared to Livmarli. The sponsor also claims that 
Bylvay may have a beneficial effect on sleep, independent of its effect on pruritus, which is known to 
disturb sleep. However, apart from general PedQL sub-scores relating to sleep/fatigue, the pivotal 
clinical trial for Bylvay also employed dedicated sleep assessment instruments which were not used in 
the pivotal trial of Livmarli (i.e. the Albireo ObsRO/PRO). This hampered the comparison of the effects 
on sleep of both treatments.  
The sponsor argues that the improvement in sleep shown for Bylvay was not caused solely by an 
improvement in pruritus, and hence one could not automatically conclude that an improvement in 
sleep would also be seen for Livmarli. The sponsor supports this claim with various analyses. 
Nevertheless, the COMP considers that even if an effect on pruritus was not the sole driver for 
improvement in sleep, the presented analyses do not entail that Livmarli does not have a positive 
effect on sleep. The COMP further noted that Livmarli also had a relevant impact on improvement of 
fatigue scores. Although not the same as sleep parameters, these are clinically related symptoms. 
Furthermore, it could not be established how Bylvay could influence sleep pharmacologically, beyond 
its effects on pruritus, and whether this would be different from Livmarli, which belongs to the same 
pharmacological class. 
6.4.  Overall conclusion COMP 
The data presented by the sponsor, including the additional data presented at the re-examination 
stage, were not deemed sufficient evidence to establish a clinically relevant advantage or a major

contribution to patient care of Bylvay over Livmarli. The criteria for maintaining the orphan designation 
as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are therefore not considered satisfied.

7.  COMP final position on review of criteria for orphan 
designation adopted on 5 October 2023 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of Alagille syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.3 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to severe pruritus, cholestasis, liver 
failure, skeletal malformations and fractures, congenital cardiac and vascular defects. Life 
expectancy is in most cases around 20 years and death is associated with haemorrhages, cardiac 
failure and end-stage liver disease; 
in view of the fact that a satisfactory method for the treatment of the condition has been 
authorised in the European Union (Livmarli), the existence of significant benefit over the authorised 
method of treatment should be established at the stage of the granting of marketing authorisation;  
the sponsor’s claim that Bylvay is of significant benefit to those affected by the orphan condition 
was not established. Significant benefit over Livmarli was claimed on the grounds of a clinically 
relevant advantage as well as a major contribution to patient care; 
the sponsor did not provide sufficient evidence to establish a clinically relevant advantage over 
Livmarli: 
−  based on the analyses presented by the sponsor, including the additional analyses presented at 
the re-examination stage, on mean change from baseline to week 48 of pruritus and serum 
bile acid (sBA) levels a significant difference in the efficacy profiles between Bylvay and 
Livmarli could not be established. The clinical relevance of some of the estimated effect 
differences is questioned, combined with uncertainty about the quantification of the effect size 
due to wide confidence intervals, risk for bias due to the differences between the studies 
including that the Livmarli arm included patients who received placebo during the randomized 
withdrawal design (RWD) phase, missing data, as well as insufficient discussion about the 
assumptions and limitations underlying the unanchored regression-adjusted matched 
comparison; 
−  with regard to the quality of life (QoL) data, an improved effect of Bylvay as compared to 
Livmarli could not be established. This is due to methodological uncertainties associated with 
assumptions underlying the unanchored regression-adjusted matched comparison, differences 
between study designs which could influence QoL scoring, including the fact that the Livmarli 
arm included patients who received placebo during the RWD phase, missing data in conjunction 
with the subjectivity of the parameters and the fact that Bylvay could not demonstrate a 
significant effect over placebo on the exploratory QoL endpoint in its pivotal clinical trial owing 
to similar improvements in QoL in the placebo treated patients;    
−  with regard to safety, a significant difference in the safety profiles between Bylvay and Livmarli 
could not be established due to methodological uncertainties related to (i) the small sample 
size and very small effective sample size, (ii) the assumptions underlying the unanchored 
regression-adjusted comparison and (iii) uncertainty over the relevance of the matched 
parameters in terms of being prognostic for adverse events. With regard to the naïve 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Page 41/42 
 
 
 
unadjusted indirect comparison and the real-world data, it was considered that, due to their 
limitations, these data could not suffice to establish the claimed differences in safety. In 
addition, the pharmacological rationale presented to explain the possible difference in gastro-
intestinal side effects was based on data sets which were difficult to compare. Also, Alagille 
syndrome is a heterogenous disease which may in itself be associated with gastro-intestinal 
symptoms; 
• 
the sponsor did not provide sufficient data to demonstrate a major contribution to patient care of 
Bylvay in comparison to Livmarli. In particular, the sponsor claims that Bylvay improves sleep as 
compared to Livmarli. The sponsor also claims that Bylvay may have a beneficial effect on sleep, 
independent of its effect on pruritus, which is known to disturb sleep. While both pivotal trials for 
Bylvay and Livmarli evaluated sleep, different scales were used. This hampered the interpretation 
of the presented data on sleep. Furthermore, it could not be established how Bylvay could 
influence sleep pharmacologically, beyond its effects on pruritus, and whether this would be 
different from Livmarli, which belongs to the same pharmacological class. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are not satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Bylvay, (2S)-2-{[(2R)-2-
[({[3,3-dibutyl-7-(methylthio)-1,1-dioxido-5-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro- 1,2,5-benzothiadiazepin-8-
yl]oxy}acetyl)amino]-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl]amino}butanoic acid, odevixibat for treatment of 
Alagille syndrome (EU/3/12/1040) is removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal 
Products.

order to update information on fertility based on final 
results from study 00571044 (21-0310); this is a 9-
week fertility and toxicokinetic study of pralsetinib 
administered via oral gavage in male Sprague 
Dawley rats. The Package Leaflet is updated 
It was specified in sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC that 
effective contraception, which must be used by males with 
females partners of childbearing potential, includes a 
barrier method. 
Section 5.3 of the SmPC was updated to reflect the results 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
of a fertility and early embryonic development study in 
which male rats administered pralsetinib were mated with 
untreated female rats and the fact that  both intrauterine 
survival of the embryos and male reproductive performance 
were unaffected by pralsetinib administration to males at 
the 20 mg/kg dose level.

Based on the final result of a Phase 1/2 Study of the 
information in the treatment of adult patients with 
RET fusion-positive advanced NSCLC based on final 
results (NSCLC indication) from study 
ARROW/BO42863 (also known as BLU-667-1101), a 
Phase 1/2 Study of the Highly-selective RET Inhibitor 
in Patients With Thyroid Cancer, Non-Small Cell Lung 
Cancer (NSCLC), and Other Advanced Solid Tumours 
listed as a specific obligation in the Annex II. The 
specific obligation is considered fulfilled and deleted 
from the Annex II. 
The RMP version 1.5 is agreed.

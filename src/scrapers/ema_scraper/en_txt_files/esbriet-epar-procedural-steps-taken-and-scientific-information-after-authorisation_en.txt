‘advanced’ idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by the 
deletion of the current qualifier ‘mild to moderate’, 
based on the results from Study MA29957; this is a 
52-week Phase IIb, multicentre, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in IPF patients

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Uncommonly, elevations in AST and ALT were associated 
to amend an existing warning on drug-induced liver 
injury (DILI) subsequent to the latest PSUSA 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00002435/201902) and post-
authorisation measure (EMEA/H/C/2154/LEG/015). 
The annex II and package leaflet (PL) are updated 
accordingly. The RMP version 10.2 has also been 
updated. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to add in the PL information about sodium content in 
line with excipients guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/302620/2017) and to correct 
formatting, punctuation and spelling mistakes in the 
with concomitant bilirubin increases. Cases of severe drug-
induced liver injury, including isolated cases with fatal 
outcome, have been reported post-marketing. Liver 
function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) should be performed 
prior to the initiation of treatment with Esbriet, and 
subsequently at monthly intervals for the first 6 months 
and then every 3 months thereafter. In addition, prompt 
clinical evaluation and measurement of liver function tests 
should be performed in patients who report symptoms that 
may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right 
upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. In the 
product information.

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order

hyponatraemia with a frequency ‘uncommon’ to the

clinical signs and symptoms of liver injury, the dose of 
Esbriet should be adjusted or treatment discontinued 
according to the guidelines listed below. For patients with 
confirmed elevations in ALT, AST or bilirubin during 
treatment, the following dose adjustments may be 
necessary. Discontinuation of other medicines associated 
with liver toxicity should be considered. Hyponatraemia has 
been reported in patients treated with Esbriet. As the 
symptoms of hyponatraemia may be subtle and masked by 
the presence of concomitant morbidities, regular 
monitoring of the relevant laboratory parameters is 
recommended, especially in the presence of evocative signs 
and symptoms such as nausea, headache or dizziness. For 
more information, please refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics.

observational registry to evaluate long-term safety in a 
real-world setting, as imposed during the marketing 
authorisation of Esbriet (pirfenidone) procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002154. Therefore, in view of available data

impairment.  Esbriet should be used with caution in 
patients with moderate (CrCl 30-50 ml/min) renal 
impairment.   Esbriet therapy should not be used in 
patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 ml/min) 
or end stage renal disease requiring dialysis. The use of 
pirfenidone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal 
impairment (CrCl <30ml/min) or end stage renal disease 
requiring dialysis. 
Approximately 70–80% of pirfenidone is metabolised via 
CYP1A2 with minor contributions from other CYP 
isoenzymes including CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. In vitro 
data indicate some pharmacologically relevant activity of 
the major metabolite (5 carboxy-pirfenidone) at 
concentrations in excess of peak plasma concentrations in 
IPF patients. This may become clinically relevant in patients 
with moderate renal impairment where plasma exposure to 
5 carboxy-pirfenidone is increased. The mean exposure to 
5 carboxy-pirfenidone was significantly higher in the 
moderate and severe renal impairment groups than in the 
group with normal renal function.

been updated with safety and efficacy information based on 
the results of three studies ASCEND/PIPF-016, PIPF-012 
and PIPF-002. The efficacy data provided from study PIPF-
016 (Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
), as well as the new pooling of the 52 week efficacy data 
have further demonstrated the efficacy of pirfenidone in 
IPF, especially with regards rate of FVC decline, 6MWT 
performance and mortality data. In addition, the safety 
update from the ongoing open label studies (PIPF-002 and 
012) as well as the safety data from PIPF-016 have allowed 
the company to further refine the adverse event profile 
over long term use.

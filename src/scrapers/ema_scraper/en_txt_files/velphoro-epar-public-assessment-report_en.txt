2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Velphoro (PA-21) is a new iron-based phosphate binder for oral administration.  
It is well known that iron compounds have phosphate adsorption properties; however, oxidic iron 
compounds like Fe2O3 have a rather low phosphate adsorption capacity, whereas soluble iron 
complexes have the disadvantage of being absorbed in the intestine. The polynuclear iron(III)-
oxyhydroxide contained in PA21 maintains phosphate adsorption capacity but is practically insoluble 
with a low iron release. 
Serum phosphate concentration is primarily determined by the ability of the kidneys to excrete dietary 
phosphate. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperphosphataemia occurs as a 
consequence of diminished phosphorus filtration and excretion. The key physiological components 
involved in the development of hyperphosphataemia and its adverse sequelae are phosphorus, calcium 
(Ca), calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, principally synthesized in the kidney), parathyroid hormone 
(PTH), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23).   
Decreased phosphorus excretion can initially be compensated by increased secretion of FGF-23 and 
PTH. With increasing phosphate levels, elevations in FGF-23 levels stimulate the renal excretion of 
phosphate and inhibit the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. PTH increases in response to 
reductions in 1,25(OH)2D. By increasing bone turnover and calcium phosphate release from bone and 
enhancing urinary phosphate excretion (via a decrease in proximal reabsorption), PTH can correct both 
the hypocalcaemia and the hyperphosphataemia. In more advanced stages of CKD, renal excretion of 
phosphorus is no longer sufficient to maintain normal serum phosphorus levels resulting in 
hyperphosphataemia. At this stage, dietary phosphate restriction may still reduce the serum 
concentration of phosphate, FGF-23, and PTH, although not usually to normal. This problem is 
exacerbated once maintenance dialysis is required; in this setting, there is essentially no phosphate 
excretion and oral phosphate binders must be given to limit phosphate absorption. In addition, levels 
of FGF-23 become extremely elevated, and the secondary hyperparathyroidism may contribute to the 
hyperphosphataemia by continuing to enhance the release of calcium phosphate from bone.  
Elevated phosphorus levels may lead to metastatic calcification, a condition where calcium and 
phosphate precipitate into soft tissues, often in association with a high calcium-phosphorus product 
(Ca x P > 4.4 mmol2/l2). Soft tissue calcifications are especially common in CKD patients if the 
calcium-phosphorus product is chronically > 5.8 mmol2/l2. Elevated serum phosphorus and calcium-
phosphorus product are associated with increased risk of death in dialysis patients (Block 1998, Young 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 9/112 
 
  
  
 
2005, Slinin 2005), although more data is needed.  The higher mortality may be due to the adverse 
effects of metastatic calcification in soft tissues such as arteries, myocardium, and lung.  
High circulating levels of PTH play an important role in the development of renal osteodystrophy and 
elevated circulating FGF-23 concentrations are strongly associated with increased cardiovascular 
mortality and renal failure. Therefore, treatment of hyperphosphataemic patients not only focuses on 
normal serum phosphorus levels but also on calcium, calcium-phosphorus product and PTH levels.  
KDOQI guidelines:  
The 2003 KDOQI practice guidelines recommend that the target serum phosphate should be between 
1.13 and 1.78 mmol/L for patients with stage 5 CKD. A phosphate level of 1.78 mmol/L is considered a 
reasonable  inflection  point  at  which  increased  mortality  has  been  observed  (National  Kidney 
Foundation, 2003a, Am J Kidney Dis). The normal phosphorus level in blood is 0.87 to 1.49 mmol/L. In 
addition,  the  calcium-phosphorus  product  should  be  below  4.4  mmol2/L2.  These  US  guidelines  also 
form the basis for the EU guidelines. 
Medical treatment of hyperphosphataemia 
Phosphate binders: 
Various phosphate binders are currently authorised and can be roughly divided into two groups, 
namely calcium-containing phosphate binders and non-calcium phosphate binders. Calcium salts (e.g. 
calcium carbonate and calcium acetate) are one of the preferred agents to bind intestinal phosphate. 
The two principal options in the latter group authorised more recently are sevelamer and lanthanum 
carbonate. Sevelamers (hydrochloride or carbonate) are non-absorbable agents that contain neither 
calcium nor aluminium. These drugs are cationic polymers that bind phosphate through ion exchange.  
The most common adverse events with phosphate binders are GI events, in line with their local mode 
of action. Hypercalcaemia is a common complication of calcium salts and careful monitoring of serum 
calcium concentration is essential. The long-term safety of lanthanum, particularly its possible effect on 
bone and other organs, remains unclear. 
Phosphate binders like aluminium hydroxide, magnesium-containing antacids and calcium citrate are 
not generally used as primary therapy because of their association with neurological, skeletal and 
haematological toxicity. Because of the limited phosphorus binding capacity of all phosphate binders, 
they are only effective if the dietary restrictions for phosphorus are continued simultaneously. 
Which phosphate binder should be used, depends on many factors including comorbidity, side-effects, 
additional beneficial effects, patient preference and compliance. All phosphate binders have been 
shown effective in controlling serum phosphorus levels, which is the surrogate endpoint. There are 
some data indicating that calcium salts were superior to sevelamer in reducing phosphorus levels. No 
clear data are available on clinical endpoints like all-cause or cardiovascular mortality and the effect on 
the surrogate outcomes of bone mineral density or histomorphometry and vascular calcification are 
unclear. Compared with calcium salts, sevelamer and lanthanum carbonate were associated with 
significantly lower rates of treatment-related hypercalcaemia. The DCOR study (Suki W., et al. Effects 
of sevelamer and calcium-based phosphate binders on mortality in haemodialysis patients. Kidney Int 
2007; 72: 1130-1137) did not report a difference in risk of all-cause mortality between sevelamer and 
calcium salts and more data are needed on the influence of calcium-based binders on progression of 
vascular calcification and the impact of decreasing vascular calcification on survival outcomes. The 
choice of phosphate binder in clinical practice will ultimately be an individual approach.

Other treatments: 
Patients may receive calcium supplements to restore calcium levels. In addition, patients are usually 
treated with vitamin D or its analogues to reduce PTH levels. Calcimimetics may also be used to 
increase the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid gland to calcium.  
However, calcitriol and other vitamin D analogues also increase intestinal phosphate absorption and 
can exacerbate the hyperphosphatemia unless bone remodelling is reduced due to inhibition of PTH 
secretion. High doses of vitamin D analogues also stimulate vascular calcification. 
During the validation phase of the centralised procedure for Velphoro an anonymous letter was 
received from a third party by the EMA on 18th of January 2013.  In this letter some concerns were 
raised concerning the percentage of the iron absorption in the target group, accumulation of the iron in 
the liver in non-clinical studies, side effects of iron, possible risks of accidents of poisoning with iron 
preparations, increase the risk of chronic diseases associated with high iron intake, risk of iron 
overload and inhibiting of absorption of zinc and copper and concerns regarding the chronic use of iron. 
A second anonymous letter was received from a third party by the EMA on 3rd of October 2013. In this 
letter some concerns were raised concerning the daily (1,000 mg iron/day), claiming that it would 
induce oxidative stress in the stomach and intestine.  
A third anonymous letters was received from a third party by the EMA on 5th November 2013 and 
fourth letter was received on 21th of November 2013. The issues raised are comparable to those 
raised in the initial two letters. A fifth letter was received from a third party by the EMA on the 20th 
June 2014 raising concerns on the potential cancerogenicity of the product. 
The concerns raised by the anonymous letters were carefully assessed upon by the CHMP, and the 
relevant concerns raised were addressed in the questions to the Applicant during the evaluation 
procedure and were successfully addressed by the Applicant.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is available as chewable tablet containing 500 mg iron as polynuclear iron(III)-

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance is mixture of polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide, sucrose, 
and starches and has the following structure:  
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 11/112 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide is the active moiety.  
The hydrated polynuclear FeOOH core is “wrapped” by sucrose. The presence of sucrose is essential for 
the maintenance of the hydrated structure of the polynuclear FeOOH and maintains the high phosphate 
adsorption capacity. Starches, and the other carbohydrates, are used to improve process ability during 
the manufacturing process.  
Neither sucrose nor the starches form direct covalent bonds to the active moiety. The interaction 
between the core surface and the sucrose occurs by hydrogen bonding of surface Fe(III)-OH groups 
with hydroxyl groups (OH) of sucrose. 
It was sufficiently demonstrated that the active moiety polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide cannot be 
isolated and stored without the sucrose, and starch, which  are also necessary for the processability of 
the active substance during the manufacturing process of the finished product. 
The active substance is brown amorphous powder, odourless and slightly hygroscopic. This active 
substance is partly soluble in water.  
Polymorphism was not been observed. In addition, the active substance has a non-chiral molecular 
structure. 
Evidence of the physical-chemical structure was provided in the form of measurements by several 
analytical techniques, such as measurement of the mineralogical structure by X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
and edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), IR detection, 
mössbauer spectroscopy, microscopy, BET analysis and melting point. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesised in four steps: synthesis, desalination, addition of the 
carbohydrates and drying using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. A detailed description of the manufacturing process has been provided, including 
reaction conditions, quantities and starting materials and yields. The in-process controls are laid down. 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 12/112 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The manufacturing process of the active substance is well controlled and consistently produces the 
amorphous form. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origins and characterised. The carry-over of impurities, reagents, solvents and 
catalysts from the starting material into the final active substance has been also discussed.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The active substance is 
packaged in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) foil (tube) or an LDPE cross-bottom bag. The primary 
packaging itself is stored in another LDPE cross-bottom bag containing a packed desiccant and is 
closed air-tight (secondary packaging). The materials in contact with the active substance comply with 
the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR and NIR), loss on 
drying (Ph. Eur.), particle size (Ph. Eur.), microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.), assay (complexometric 
titration, NIR, HPLC-RID) and in vitro phosphate adsorption (ICP-OES). 
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was also 
provided for the in-house analytical methods in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. The 
analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity 
limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch analysis data are provided on 5 production batches produced of the active substance. All the 
batches were manufactured according to the proposed synthetic route, and the batch analysis data 
show that the active substance can be manufactured reproducibly. All results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Five production scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial packaging 
from the proposed manufacturers were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term 
(25°C/60%RH), (30°C/60%RH)  for up 48 months and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up 6 months. 
The active substance used in the primary stability studies was manufactured according to the 
commercial process.  
Forced degradation studies were conducted by exposing the active substance to high temperature, 
aqueous hydrolysis, acid and base conditions. Based on these studies it is observed that the active 
substance is sensitive to acid conditions. 
Photostability testing following ICH guidelines Q1B was performed on one batch of the active 
substance. The results showed that there are no significant changes for any of the evaluated 
parameters established for the stability studies. 
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were also the same 
as for release and were stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is stable at controlled room temperature. The 
results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a chewable tablet able to deliver the 
correct dose. Before starting the development the applicant studied important physical and chemical 
characteristics of the active substance such as solubility, stability, particle size, etc. 
As already mentioned, the active substance is partly soluble in water. The sucrose present in the active 
substance dissolves in the aqueous medium of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is digested to glucose 
and fructose. Starch is digested to glucose and maltose. These compounds are absorbed. However, 
Polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide is practically insoluble and iron cannot be absorbed. Iron(III)-
oxyhydroxides are microbiologically not stable as an aqueous suspension and are dehydrated when 
dried or stored, which results in a decrease of the phosphate binding capacity. Therefore, the iron(III)-
oxyhydroxide alone cannot be isolated and stored as an active substance. Sucrose is added to the iron 
compound to stabilize the iron core and thus maintain the high phosphate adsorption capacity. 
Starches are added as processing aids to allow for isolation, characterisation and stability testing of the 
drug substance.  
Considering that the iron component of the active substance is practically insoluble, the particle size of 
the active substance is not critical with regards to bioavailability as compared to drugs that need to be 
absorbed. The particle size distribution is narrow with low variability between batches due to the 
defined manufacturing process of the active substance by spray drying. Due to the high amount of 
active substance in the drug product (97%), the particle size distribution has no impact on the content 
uniformity. 
The effect of the particle size distribution of the active substance on the phosphate adsorption was 
evaluated during formulation development. Differences found in phosphate adsorption of different 
particle sizes had no impact in the efficacy of active substance. 
Compatibility studies of the active substance with a number of standard excipients used in chewable 
tablets were performed and the results did not show any significant interaction. The flavours and 
sweeteners were selected during the pharmaceutical development and evaluated by a taste sensor 
(electronic tongue, Astree e-tongue), which can detect taste in a manner similar to human gustatory 
sensation. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
During the drug development, the Applicant introduced some changes in the composition and in the 
manufacturing process in order to obtain the final formulation. 
During the pharmaceutical development, the quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined 
according to the International Conference on Harmonisation Q8. The main objective of the applicant 
was to develop a pharmaceutical form that meets compendium and other relevant quality standards, 
and is packaged in child resistance packaging. The functional relationships linking material attributes 
and process parameters to the critical quality attributes (CQAs ) were determined by a design of 
experiments, in order to demonstrate that the multidimensional combination and interaction of input 
variables (e.g., material attributes) and process parameters provide assurance of quality. The 
pharmaceutical development and manufacturing process have been evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment and design of experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical

process parameters. A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) 
method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an influence on 
the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge of 
products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from 
formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. The critical process parameters have 
been adequately identified. Based on the risk assessment and take in account that the manufacturing 
process is a standard process, the selections of the critical process parameters (CPPS) are considered 
justified. The DoE studies support the design space. The adequate process validation data further 
support the boundaries of the three parameters of the design space. 
The active substance works by binding phosphate in the gastro-intestinal tract and is therefore not 
intended to be absorbed. Therefore, no bioequivalence studies between the clinical formulation and the 
proposed commercial formulation have been conducted. Nevertheless, the Applicant demonstrated that 
the different excipients ratio and active substance load used in the different formulations did not have 
any impact on product quality attributes. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method 
developed has been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is sufficiently described and is reflected in the SmPC. The material complies 
with Ph Eur and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the medicinal product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: blending, lubrication, compression and 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process pharmaceutical form.  
The design space has been developed at commercial scale by using three different batches. It was also 
noted that the parameters of the DS are scale independent. 
The validation of the manufacturing process has been evaluated on three consecutive production scale 
batches. The quality of the production batches was evaluated through the results of in process testing 
as well as the results of finished product testing. The process validation is supported by batch data on 
three production scale batches 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
characteristics (visual examination), identification (HPLC, NIRS), assay (HPLC), mass variation (Ph 
Eur), moisture, microbiological quality (Ph Eur), assay (complexometric titration, NIR, HPLC-RID), in 
vitro phosphate adsorption (ICP-OES), hardness (Ph Eur) and disintegration time (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch analysis data of six scale batches of the finished product are provided. The results confirm the 
consistency of the process and its ability to manufacture a product complying with the product 
specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability data of six scale batches for of finished product stored under long term conditions for 18 
months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, intermediate  conditions for 18 months at 30 ºC / 75% RH and for up to 
six months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were also the same 
as for release and were stability indicating. 
One batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. In addition stress stability studies were performed on one fully 
representative batch under various extreme conditions including high temperature, aqueous 
hydrolysis, acid and base conditions.  
Based on the available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. This medicine contains a mixture of polynuclear iron(III)-
oxyhydroxide, sucrose, and starches as an active substance. However, the polynuclear iron(III)-
oxyhydroxide is considered the active moiety. The manufacturing flow-chart was provided with suitable 
in-process controls. The manufacturing process is adequately validated at full scale at the proposed 
manufacturing site and a validation protocol has been presented.  The design space has been proposed 
and developed at commercial scale by using three different batches. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead 
to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.1.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.1.1.  Introduction 
All pivotal toxicology studies were performed in accordance with GLP regulations. 
2.1.2.  Pharmacology 
The intended pharmacological action of PA21 is to bind dietary phosphate in the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract, resulting in phosphate excretion with the faeces and thereby preventing phosphate absorption. 
This is the intended mechanism of action for the control of serum phosphorus levels in patients with 
end stage renal disease (ESRD). In vitro studies demonstrated efficient phosphate binding by PA21 
under simulated GI tract conditions (pH range of 1.2 to 8.5). Data from these in vitro studies showed 
at least equivalent phosphate binding capacity of PA21 compared to currently available phosphate 
binders. In vivo studies conducted in a rat model of chronic renal failure (CRF) showed that PA21 was 
as effective as calcium carbonate, sevelamer carbonate and lanthanum carbonate in correcting the 
hyperphosphataemia and associated secondary hyperparathyroidism observed in the model, and was 
more effective than calcium carbonate and, to some extent, lanthanum carbonate in preventing 
vascular calcification in the thoracic aorta. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro 
Data on the primary pharmacodynamic activity and mode of action of PA21 were largely provided by in 
vitro phosphate binding studies under simulated GI tract conditions. 
Phosphate adsorption under gastrointestinal conditions 
The phosphate binding capacity of PA21-2 was investigated over a pH range of 1.2 to 7.5, to cover the 
potential pH range that may be encountered in the GI tract (Study SR-1330-01/E01). An amount of 
PA21-2 corresponding to 50 mg iron was incubated with 10 mL of inorganic phosphate solution 
containing 11.14 mg phosphorus. At pH 1.2 (equivalent to that in an empty human stomach), PA21-2 
bound 0.18 mg P/mg Fe, and there was some release of iron from PA21 at this very low pH (6.2% 
release; see pharmacokinetics section). At the pH which may be found in a full human stomach (about 
2.5), phosphate binding was slightly higher (0.20-0.21 mg P/mg Fe) and similar binding values were 
observed at pH values of 4.5, 7.0 and 7.5, which may be encountered in the small and large intestines. 
There was no or little release of iron (0-1.3%) at pH 2.5 and above (see pharmacokinetics section). 
These data not only support the proposed dosing regimen of PA21 being taken with food, but they 
indicate that it is important that PA21 is taken with food. Iron release of 6.2% relates to 186 mg iron 
from a maximum dose of 3000 mg iron per day. This could lead to iron overload. 
To further investigate phosphate binding capacity, and to compare PA21-2 to other marketed 
phosphate binders, a comparison was performed with sevelamer HCl, lanthanum carbonate, calcium 
acetate and calcium carbonate at pH values of 3.0, 5.5 and 8.0 (Study TC-1118/E01). 100 mg of each 
compound (corresponding to 21 mg iron for PA21-2) was incubated with 20 ml of a 20 mM phosphate 
solution, corresponding to 38 mg phosphate. The quantity of active substance needed to bind 1,000 
mg of phosphate was calculated. The data showed that at the typical pH that may be encountered in 
the stomach after food (about pH 3.0), PA21-2 showed similar phosphate binding capacity as 
sevelamer HCl and lanthanum carbonate, the quantities of active substance required to bind 1,000 mg 
phosphate being 8.6 g (corresponding to 1.7 g Fe) for PA21-2, 7.1 g for sevelamer HCl and 6.9 g for 
lanthanum carbonate. Calcium acetate and calcium carbonate showed no or only low phosphate

binding capacity at this pH, although improved binding capacity was observed for these calcium salts 
at pH 5.5. At pH 5.5, and 8.0, PA21-2 showed lower phosphate binding capacity than at pH 3.0, but 
was superior to lanthanum carbonate at these higher pH values. 
Further in vitro studies examined the phosphate adsorption capacity and iron release from PA21 under 
simulated GI tract conditions (Study REP000122TC-EN01v.1). Two different pH cycles were examined, 
so as to reproduce the range and sequence of pH values that PA21 would encounter during a passage 
through the GI tract. These experiments showed high phosphate binding at low pH values (1.5 or 2.6), 
and robust binding up to a slightly alkaline conditions (pH 8.1). Iron release (6.3%) was only observed 
at the lowest pH tested (1.5), representative of the fasting state of the stomach. Iron release at higher 
pH values was low. 
Mode of action 
It is well known that iron oxides adsorb phosphates. The manner in which this is achieved was 
examined in older experiments with hydrated goethite (α-FEOOH) (Parfitt and Russell, 1977; Sigg and 
Stumm, 1981). It was shown that each phosphate can replace two OH groups in the α-FeOOH complex 
to form the binuclear, bidentate FeOPO(OH)OFe complex.  
Experiments performed to assess the phosphate binding capacity of PA21 showed molar ratios 
phosphate to iron of up to 0.7 in the slightly acidic pH range (Geisser and Philipp, 2001), which could 
not be explained by the simple adsorption mechanism as described above. Such a ratio is only 
achievable if a major amount of iron phosphate is formed. Whether such a formation of a new phase 
would actually take place taking into consideration different pH conditions, was aimed to be clarified in 
study REP000128TC-EN03v.1. The approaches used included thermodynamic calculations, molar 
iron/phosphorus ratios, colour analysis and spectroscopy techniques, including inductively coupled 
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). One gram of PA21 API was 
incubated with 40 mL of phosphate buffer (57 g phosphorus/L) of different pH values (1.2, 3.0, 5.6, 
8.2) for 2 hours at 37ºC.  
Results indicate that under acidic conditions, mainly iron phosphate is formed, whereas under slightly 
alkaline conditions, iron(III)-oxyhydroxide is the favoured chemical species. 
The data above suggest there are two separate mechanisms by which phosphate is bound by PA21. 
The first mechanism is simple adsorption of phosphate to the iron complex. The older studies in which 
this was examined used hydrated goethite, which is a α-form of FeOOH, while the β-form (Akaganeite) 
is present in PA21. It is assumed that adsorption of phosphate occurs in a similar manner.  
The second mechanism is the formation of iron phosphate, FePO4, which seems to be the predominant 
mechanism at low pH (e.g. in the stomach), with decreasing quantities being formed at higher pH. In 
fact according to study REP000128TC-EN03v.1, FeOOH is indicated to be mainly converted to FePO4 at 
low pH, when in the presence of phosphate.  
It must be assumed that both mechanisms play a role, and that some FePO4 is formed in the stomach, 
and further adsorption of phosphate to the FeOOH moiety will take place in the remainder of the GIT, 
where it is excreted in the faeces. 
Phosphate binding in gastrointestinal transit (TIM) model 
Studies were performed with an in vitro gastrointestinal transit model (TIM), to evaluate phosphate 
binding to PA21, iron release and uptake, fermentation of Fe3+ to Fe2+, and potential for bile 
sequestering.

Since Velphoro is intended to bind phosphorous from the diet, the fed state is most relevant for the 
evaluation of efficacy. In study V8091, two experiments were performed in the fed and fasted state, 
respectively, one with an actual meal, and one with a replacement meal which contained only a 
phosphate solution so as to imitate the same amount of phosphate intake as the “normal” meal. There 
are large differences in the outcome of the two experiments. Phosphorous binding is very low in the 
first experiment, with only a 17% reduction in absorption as compared to control (0.07 mg P/ mg Fe), 
whereas the second experiment showed a reduction of absorption of 37%. The amount of P per mg Fe 
could not be retrieved from the data of the second experiment. The authors of the report mention that 
the low binding efficacy of PA21 (and of the other products). A second study (V9209) was performed to 
investigate the low binding efficacy seen in the previous study. It is mentioned that different 
experimental conditions were used in this study, but it is not clear what the difference exactly is. The 
meal matrix is the same. Somewhat higher binding is observed, up to 0.13 mg P/ mg Fe. 
Overall, the TIM studies are of limited value for the determination of efficacy of PA21 due to the low 
phosphate binding in the studies. The TIM studies also do not add information about the mechanism of 
action, as only the amount of Fe is measured and it is therefore not known whether the phosphate is 
bound in the FePO4 form, or whether it is adsorbed to the FeOOH moiety.  
However, in line with the in vitro data on iron absorption through the gut, the TIM experiment 
underscores the need for co-administration of PA21 with food, as in the fasted state 40 mg (10%) of 
the Fe ingested as PA21 was absorbed. This would amount to 300 mg Fe for the maximum dose of 
3000 mg Fe in PA21. This is more than 16x the recommended daily dose of 18 mg Fe. 
Up to 16% of bile acids were bound to PA21. Although this should not be considered as negligible, 
there are no signs, either from non-clinical studies or from the clinical trials that this is of any 
consequence. 
Reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ does not seem to be an important factor in this simulation model as no 
Fe2+ was measured in the dialysate, and only a very minor amount was measured in the lumen. 
In vivo 
Phan 2012a: Effects of PA21, a New Iron-Based Phosphate Binder on Vascular Calcification in Chronic 
Renal Failure Rats. 
PA21-2 was tested in a rat model of chronic renal failure. Serum phosphorous levels in CRF rats pre-
treatment were elevated as compared to controls (5.39 ± 0.16 vs. 2.68 ± 0.18 mmol/L.  The applicant 
states that after 4 weeks of treatment, there is a dose related decrease in phosphorus serum levels. 
However, it appears that the phosphorus levels are also reduced in untreated CRF rats (2.91 ± 0.24 for 
untreated vs. 2.21 ± 0.09 for treated with 5%). Other parameters, including phosphaturia, vascular 
calcification were reduced by PA21 treatment, while iPTH was somewhat reduced from 3261 pg/ml in 
de CRF control, to 1138 pg/ml in the PA21 5% group (control value of non-CRF rats: 105 pg/ml). 
Moreover, the dose which is used is expressed as percentage of the diet. Most effects are seen at 5%, 
but it is unclear how this dose relates to the clinical dose. Therefore, although it is clear treatment with 
PA21 in CRF rats has some effect, the effect on serum phosphorus is questionable in this model.  
Phan 2012b: Effects of PA21 Compared to Lanthanum Carbonate and Sevelamer Carbonate on 
Phosphate Homeostasis and Vascular Calcifications in a Rat Model of Chronic Kidney Failure 
In this second study using the CRF rat model, excretion of phosphorus in urine vs. faeces was 
measured. There is a large shift towards excretion via faeces after PA21 treatment (44% vs. 70%), 
indicating that phosphorus is bound to the complex and not absorbed from the GI tract. Other

parameters, including urine phosphorus and calcium, are very variable and therefore difficult to 
interpret. Arterial calcification was reduced due to treatment with PA21 and other products. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Malluche 2010: Effects of Various Phosphate Binders on Mineral and Bone Metabolism. 
In this secondary pharmacology study, the main focus was the effect of phosphate binders including 
PA21-2, on bone turnover, since this is one of the adverse effects seen in patients with ESRD, which is 
associated with disturbances in phosphorus homeostasis. To examine this, a rat model of induced renal 
failure was used. However, the only difference between rats with renal failure and those without, is a 
reduced creatinine clearance. Groups of 8 male Sprague Dawley rats were maintained on a high 
phosphate diet (0.73% phosphorus) and renal failure was induced in all groups (apart from a control 
group fed high phosphate diet only) by incorporation of adenine (0.75% in the first week, 0.50% 
thereafter) into the diet. Phosphate binders (PA21-2, aluminium hydroxide, calcium acetate, 
lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate) were administered at dosages of 600 mg/kg/day in 
the diet to rats for a period of 4 weeks (period when adenine was fed). Rats were investigated for renal 
function and calcium/phosphate metabolism markers (serum and urinary creatinine, calcium and 
phosphorus levels) as well as markers of bone metabolism (serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), 
calcitriol and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) levels). Detailed histology and histomorphometry of 
femur samples, including static and dynamic parameters of bone structure, formation and resorption 
were measured by semi-automatic methods at standardised sites below the growth plate. Other 
parameters including serum or urine phosphorous and calcium, serum calcitriol and parathyroid 
hormone, are not affected, indicating that this might not be an appropriate model to study change in 
bone turnover. Some of the bone parameters measured (number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts/bone 
parameter) do seem to be affected due to induction of renal failure. Moreover, results are very 
variable, with large standard deviations. In conclusion, this study is of limited value for the evaluation 
of the impact of PA21-2 on bone turnover in ESRD patients. 
Malluche 2012: Effects of PA21 Compared to Lanthanum Carbonate and Sevelamer Carbonate on Bone 
Abnormalities in a Rat Model of Chronic Renal Failure. 
This study comprised a histopathological and histomorphometric examination of femur samples 
obtained from the rat CRF model study of Phan 2012b. The effects on bone turnover and formation 
were examined in this study. Unlike the previous study, this rat model does indeed show the 
symptoms of renal failure, including changes in serum and urine phosphorus and calcium, and serum 
iPTH. Bone samples were processed for mineralised bone histology, and stained with modified Masson-
Goldner trichrome and Gomori stain (for iron). Static and dynamic parameters of trabecular bone 
structure, formation and resorption were measured at a standardised site below the growth plate using 
a semi-automated method. Cortical thickness was measured using the same methodology. 
There were no changes in bone structure in CRF rats, but this might be an effect that will be seen later 
in time, as changes in bone formation are evident.  
Treatment with PA21-2 caused a reversal of some of the effects seen on bone formation. The increased 
number of osteoblasts/bone perimeter, increased osteoblast surface and bone formation rate were 
reduced back to the value of normal rats. This indicates that higher bone turnover as seen in CRF rats 
can be normalized by PA21-2 treatment. However, treatment with PA21-2 had no effect on changes in 
the osteoid (increased thickness, surface and volume), and likewise mineralization lag time and osteoid 
maturation time remained as high as in untreated CRF rats. This indicates that, at least in this rat 
model, PA21-2 did not reduce osteomalacia as seen in CRF rats and ESRD patients.

Safety pharmacology programme 
A standard battery of safety pharmacology studies was performed with PA21-2. The compound had no 
significant effects on respiratory, central nervous system or gastro-intestinal motility parameters in 
rats up to 5000 mg/kg. Also in dogs up to 1000 mg/kg, no effects on the cardiovascular system were 
observed. An in vitro hERG channel assay was not performed. This is agreed, considering the nature of 
the product. 
Respiratory system 
Study VFR081/052332 (GLP): Evaluation of Respiratory Parameters in the Conscious Rat Using Whole 
Body Bias Flow Plethysmography 
A single oral dose of PA21 at 1,250, 2,500 or 5,000 mg/kg given to groups of 8 male CD rats produced 
no significant changes in respiration rate, tidal volume and minute volume. Morphine sulphate at an 
oral dose of 200 mg/kg produced statistically significant decreases in respiration rate and minute 
volume at 30 minutes post-dose and a significant decrease in respiration rate at 90 minutes post-dose, 
thus confirming the validity of the test system. 
Central nervous system 
Study VFR082/052395 (GLP): Irwin Dose Range in Rats, Including Body Temperature and Locomotor 
Assessment 
A single oral dose of PA21 at 1,250, 2,500 or 5,000 mg/kg given to groups of 4 male CD rats produced 
no changes in the behavioural or physiological state during detailed observation performed up to 24 
hours after dosing. No marked or statistically significant effects on locomotor activity or body 
temperature were observed. 
Gastro-intestinal system 
Study VFR085/052415 (GLP): Charcoal Propulsion Test in Rats 
Single oral PA21 dosages of 1,250, 2,500 or 5,000 mg/kg were administered to groups of 10 male CD 
rats, 45 minutes prior to oral administration of a charcoal suspension. Rats were killed 30 minutes 
after charcoal administration and the distance the charcoal meal had travelled from the pyloric 
sphincter was determined, as a measure of GI motility. PA21 at 1,250 mg/kg had no effect on 
intestinal motility. At 2,500 and 5,000 mg/kg, slight increases in distance travelled by the charcoal 
meal were observed, but the increases were not dosage-related. It was, therefore, concluded that 
these changes were unlikely to be treatment-related or of biological significance. A group of rats dosed 
orally with morphine sulphate at 50 mg/kg as a positive control showed the expected significant 
reduction in GI motility, thereby confirming the validity of the test system. 
Cardiovascular system 
Study VFR083/043639 (GLP): Evaluation of Cardiovascular Effects in Conscious Telemetered Beagle 
Dogs 
A single oral dose of PA21 at 250, 500 or 1,000 mg/kg to 2 male and 2 female beagle dogs showed no 
adverse effects on arterial blood pressure or heart rate at any dose. There were no effects of treatment 
on electrocardiographic rhythm or waveform morphology, and waveform intervals (including QT 
interval) were unaffected. Clinical findings in the test animals were restricted to a dose-dependent 
increase in the incidence of dark coloured faeces the day after PA21 administration, attributable to the 
excretion of PA21 and/or its iron content, this finding not being considered adverse.

An in vitro study examining potential for PA21 to cause delayed ventricular repolarisation (QT interval 
prolongation), as outlined in the ICH S7B guideline, was not performed. Such in vitro test systems 
(e.g., hERG assay) are not relevant or appropriate for high molecular weight compounds or insoluble 
compounds such as PA21. A compound of the size of PA21 would be unlikely to interact with ion 
channels involved in ventricular repolarisation, and the components of PA21 (iron(III)-oxyhydroxide, 
sucrose, starch) are all innocuous substances that are unlikely to exert any effects on cardiac 
conduction. In addition, QT intervals were assessed in vivo as part of the cardiovascular safety study 
conducted by telemetry in dogs, with no effects of PA21 being observed. Therefore, the omission of an 
in vitro study examining potential for QT interval prolongation is considered justified and further safety 
pharmacology studies are not required. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
An in vivo study and several in vitro studies were performed to assess the potential for 
pharmacodynamic interaction of PA21 with co-administered drugs, vitamins, nutrients and bile acids. 
An in vivo drug interaction study showed that only minimal amounts of iron are absorbed from PA21 in 
the mouse (0.55%), and that this is not affected by the co-administration of any other drug except 
ascorbic acid, which caused an increase in absorption to 0.83% of the total ingested PA21. 
Several drugs tested in vitro showed a potential to bind to and interact with PA21. These findings have 
led to a clinical interaction study, which showed no meaningful interactions.  
There was no evidence of a biologically relevant adsorption or degradation of various water-soluble 
vitamins (folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, pyridoxine), amino acids (methionine and tryptophan) 
and anions (fluoride, oxalate and sulphate) or the macronutrient oxalate. 
Binding of PA21 to the bile acids cholylglycine, chenodeoxycholylglycine and deoxycholyltaurine was 
examined at pH 5.5 and 8.0. Up to 14.3% of chenodeoxycholylglycine was bound to PA21 in this in 
vitro test system. This is in line with what was found in the TIM-1 system (see primary 
pharmacodynamics). 
In the study (SR-1039/E01), groups of 3 male NMRI mice were treated for 5 consecutive days with 
1,140 mg/kg/day PA21 by oral gavage. The iron in the PA21 was radio-labelled with 59Fe. In order to 
assess the potential interaction between PA21 and foodstuffs or other pharmaceutical products that 
may be administered to CKD patients, mice were treated either with PA21 only, or PA21 plus 1 of the 
following (all given by oral administration): 
• Caffeine (66.7 mg/kg/day) 
• Ascorbic acid (11.7 mg/kg/day) 
• Calcium gluconate (200 mg/kg/day) 
• Magnesium aspartate (66.7 mg/kg/day) 
• Phytic acid (215.6 mg/kg/day) 
• Furosemide/Lasix (250 mg/kg/day) 
• Enalapril/Reniten (6.7 mg/kg/day) 
• Captopril/Lopirin (25 mg/kg/day) 
Mice were killed 16 days after the first dose of PA21 and/or foodstuff/pharmaceutical, and blood, liver, 
kidney, spleen, stomach, intestine and right femur were removed for radioactivity determinations. The 
percentage of the administered radioactivity dose recovered in the blood and other organs was 
calculated for each study group. In control animals, dosed only with labelled PA21, 0.55% (±0.10%) of 
Assessment report

Page 22/112 
 
  
  
the administered dose was recovered in the blood and selected organs, this being consistent with 
previous mouse studies that showed 99.39% of administered PA21 was recovered in the faeces and 
urine in the first 10 days after administration. Of the various co-administered treatments, only ascorbic 
acid caused a slight increase in iron uptake and retention in the blood and tissues, 0.83% (±0.27%) of 
the administered radioactivity being recovered in mice co-administered PA21 and ascorbic acid. For all 
other co-treatments, recovery values were similar to those of the control animals, indicating that other 
foodstuffs and pharmaceutical products that may be administered to CKD patients are unlikely to 
interact with the iron component of PA21 in a way to induce dissociation of significant amounts of iron, 
and the various co-treatments are unlikely to increase the risk of iron uptake and accumulation during 
PA21 treatment. 
The various in vitro DDI studies revealed no significant binding/interaction of PA21 with ciprofloxacin, 
enalapril, digoxin, metoprolol, nifedipine, warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin or quinidine. No 
adsorption was found for cinacalcet or glipizide either but results were inconclusive at some pH values. 
No conclusion could be drawn from the in vitro DDI study with candesartan cilexetil due to lack of 
tablet dissolution. Moderate adsorption to PA21 was noted for pioglitazone. Extensive binding or 
interactions were observed for furosemide, losartan, atorvastatin, doxycycline, alendronate, 
levothyroxine and paricalcitol. The observed adsorption of levothyroxine, paricalcitol and atorvastatin 
was less pronounced in the presence of phosphate, which will compete for binding to PA21. 
These in vitro observations led to the conduct of human DDI studies for furosemide and losartan, and 
also 2 drugs where there were no clear in vitro interactions, but where a narrow therapeutic margin 
exists (i.e., warfarin and digoxin). A human DDI study has also been conducted for omeprazole where 
a marked increase in solubility was observed in the in vitro study. The human DDI studies showed no 
interactions between these drugs and PA21.  
According to the applicant, no in vitro interaction of PA21 with bile acids was observed, consistent with 
the data from the TIM-1 study (V8091, see primary pharmacodynamics). Detailed interaction studies 
conducted with various water-soluble vitamins (folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, pyridoxine), 
amino acids (methionine and tryptophan) and anions (fluoride, oxalate and sulphate) showed no 
evidence of a biologically relevant adsorption or degradation of any of these dietary components under 
physiologically relevant conditions. Furthermore, the macronutrient oxalate was shown to have no 
detectable influence on the phosphate binding capacity of PA21 under simulated GI tract conditions. 
Therefore, presence of high concentrations of a competing anion in the diet such as oxalate will not 
influence the phosphate binding efficiency of PA21. 
2.1.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Kinetic studies were conducted in rats and dogs and in mice, with radiolabelled Velphoro, administered 
orally at clinically relevant or higher dosages. Humans are dosed three times a day, while the non-
clinical species were dosed once daily in the kinetic studies. The exposure in the gastro-intestinal tract 
is therefore higher in the non-clinical species compared to humans, indicating that the local effects 
could be different due to differences in exposure. In addition, the human dose is provided as mg Fe 
while the dose administered to the pre-clinical species is provided as mg Velphoro per kg. The 
following calculation was used to convert from mg Velphoro to mg Fe: Velphoro consists of 33% 
polynuclear FeO(OH) and 0.63 of the weight of FeO(OH) is due to Fe. This conversion was applied in 
the interspecies comparison. 
Absorption, distribution and excretion studies were conducted in rats and dogs, and to a lesser extent 
in mice, with radiolabelled Velphoro, administered orally at clinically relevant dosages.  
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 23/112 
 
  
  
Velphoro works by binding phosphate in the gastro-intestinal tract and is therefore not intended to be 
absorbed. The absorption of radioactivity was low, highest radioactivity levels in blood were 1.4% of 
the administered dose. The overall absorption could not be determined due to the lack of information, 
but appears to be low (<7%). The iron release under in vitro gastro-intestinal conditions indicated that 
the iron release was highest at low pH values, with a maximum of 6.3% at a pH of 1.2-1.5. The iron 
release was much lower at higher pH values (0.3%). However, the high iron release (67%) was 
observed in an experiment with artificial gastric juice without the presence of phosphate. In an 
experiment with simulated intestinal juices, the release was maximal 6.3%. Under physiological 
conditions phosphate is present, especially under fed conditions. It is therefore more realistic to expect 
a maximal worst-case iron release of 6.3% under human gastrointestinal conditions. Thus, a maximum 
amount of 31.5 mg Fe is released from Velphoro in the gastrointestinal fluids and is available for 
absorption. 
Based on the in vivo distribution data, the blood-to-plasma ratio appears to be 1.3-1.9 indicating a 
distribution to blood cells. Distribution of radioactivity was observed to blood, liver, spleen, bone 
marrow and the gastro-intestinal tract wall. Radioactivity was present in rat after single dosing for 
168 h after dosing in whole blood, blood cells and the liver. In addition, after repeated dosing for 5 
days to mice radioactivity was present 11 days after the last dosing, but declined steadily. These data 
indicate that the small amount of systemically absorbed iron is present in a biodegradable form, rather 
than as a particle. In the large intestinal wall, where iron uptake is normally minimal due to lack of 
transporters, the presence of iron may indicate uptake of particles. There is no accumulation however, 
due to the high turnover of cells, and likewise there are no toxicological consequences. Distribution 
data from pigmented (Lister Hooded) rats were similar to those observed in albino (Sprague Dawley) 
rats, indicating a lack of binding of the radioactivity with melanin. 
Excretion of radioactivity was only observed via faeces. Some gender differences in excretion rate were 
observed between male and female rats with a lower excretion rate in females compared to males. 
After 48 hours only trace amounts were detected in faeces. There was no excretion of radioactivity via 
urine or bile after oral administration of radiolabelled Velphoro. 
Velphoro consist of polynuclear iron(III)oxyhydroxide, sucrose and starch. Enzymes present in the 
digestive juices digest sucrose and starch after oral administration into glucose, fructose and maltose. 
No differences in degradation were observed between the individual components sucrose and starch or 
present in Velphoro. The different in vitro experiments investigating the iron release under 
gastro-intestinal indicated differences in phosphate binding and iron release with a higher iron release 
in the presence of digestion enzymes. The presence of sucrose is essential for the maintenance of the 
hydrated structure of the polynuclear FeO(OH) and therefore of the high phosphate absorption capacity 
of Velphoro. 
Drug  interaction  studies  showed  that  a  number  of  common  foodstuffs  or  pharmaceutical products  did 
not  influence  the  radioactivity  uptake  from  Velphoro.  In  addition,  Velphoro  did  not  induce  CYP 
isozymes, indicating low potential for drug-drug interactions at the metabolic level. No information was 
provided  regarding  substrate  or  inhibition  potential  of  Velphoro  for  CYP  isozymes  or  transporters. 
However, based on the structure of Velphoro and its composition (polynuclear iron(III) oxyhydroxide, 
starch  and  sucrose),  it  is  unlikely  that  Velphoro  will  be  a  substrate  or  inhibit  CYP  enzymes  or  drug 
transporters. If iron is released from Velphoro, than the iron will be absorbed by the iron transporters 
present in the duodenum.

2.1.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
One single-dose toxicity study was performed by the oral route in rats. At a dosage of 1,000 mg Fe/kg, 
about 16 times the maximum likely human dose (60 mg Fe/kg for a 50 kg person), no deaths or signs 
of toxicity were observed. It was concluded that the lowest lethal dose of PA21 by the oral route in rats 
was greater than 1,000 mg Fe/kg. In accordance with the ICH M3 (R2) guideline, separate acute 
toxicity studies in 2 mammalian species for pharmaceuticals are not necessary where appropriate data 
are available from range finding studies, and studies providing information on acute toxicity by the 
clinical dose route alone are sufficient. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose toxicity studies were performed in rats and dogs (4, 13 and 26 or 39 weeks). Findings 
in rat studies can be divided into two groups. Firstly, a number of observed changes consist of an 
exaggerated pharmacological effect in healthy normophosphataemic animals, which are therefore not 
considered relevant for ESRD patients. These changes include serum phosphorus and calcium changes, 
a marked decrease in phosphorus excretion, with increased calcium excretion, accompanied by 
changes in pH, volume and specific gravity, increases in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and 25-
hydroxyvitamin D, and increases in markers of bone turnover (serum osteocalcin, urinary 
deoxypyrodinoline). Other findings not of toxicological concern are dark/abnormal faeces and dark 
contents of the GI tract, which are both due to the nature of the medicinal product. 
Second, effects related to the high iron content in PA21 are observed. This was most evident as 
increases in serum and tissue iron levels, principally in the liver and spleen, and sometimes in the 
kidney, and increased positive Perls staining which indicates an increase in iron deposition in the liver 
(periportal hepatocytes and Kupffer cells), spleen (red pulp macrophages), mesenteric lymph node 
macrophages, epithelial cells or lamina propria macrophages in the small and large intestine. Tissue 
iron content was generally increased by no more than 2-fold, as measured in liver, spleen and kidney. 
However, from the pharmacokinetic data, it is shown that the iron content is highest in the large 
intestinal wall, which indicates that iron content might be more than 2-fold increased in this organ. The 
extent of iron deposition in the large intestinal wall, and the form in which the iron is present, is cause 
for concern, since it could lead to local adverse reactions. This issue, including the epithelial 
hyperplasia in the large intestine, is further discussed in the section on carcinogenicity. With regard to 
increased iron content in systemic organs, the change is relatively small, and ESRD patient are 
generally anaemic and require the intake of additional iron, the risk of iron overload is considered 
small. Moreover, there were no signs of toxicity in these organs. 
As with the rat studies, findings in dogs are generally related to the pharmacological effect of PA21, or 
to the high iron content, although effects are less extensive than in rats. Systemically increased tissue 
iron content was only seen after 39 weeks of treatment, at a dose of 60 mg /kg/b.i.d. However, 
increased iron deposition was seen at lower doses and at earlier time points, in the form of positive 
Perls staining in mesenteric and mandibular lymph nodes, surface epithelium of the colon and rectum, 
Kupffer cells, and several residential macrophages   
Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins was not significantly affected by treatment with PA21. 
The 4-week bridging study conducted in rats to test the new starch form in PA21-2, is considered 
adequate to conclude there are no significant differences between PA21 and PA21-2. Therefore, all 
non-clinical studies are appropriate for the evaluation of the drug intended to be marketed.

Genotoxicity 
The in vitro studies were conducted with the highest dose of 5000 µg/plate or mg of PA21. 
Throughout the dossier however, doses have been calculated as mg Fe, since this is assumed the 
active moiety of the complex. This results in doses of up to 1000 µg Fe/plate or mg for the in vitro 
studies. 
The  in  vitro  assays  (bacterial  mutation  or  Ames  test,  chromosome  aberration  test)  conducted  with 
PA21  were  negative  and  showed  no  mutagenic  potential  of  PA21  up  to  1000  µg/plate.  In  the 
chromosome aberration test, the highest concentration of 1000 µg/ml PA21-2 showed a positive result 
with an increased percentage of aberrant cells. The subsequent study with  PA21-2 was negative with 
regard  to  chromosome  aberrations,  but  showed  an  increased  number  of  polyploid  cells  at  all 
concentrations tested after 15 hours of exposure (and not after 3 hours). Polyploidy was not measured 
or reported on in the study with PA21. As part of the comparability or bridging exercise performed to 
support the change in starch source prior to Phase 3 clinical trials, the 2 in vitro assays were repeated 
with  PA21-2  (i.e.,  PA21  manufactured  using  the  potato  and  corn  starch  mixture),  also  with  clear-cut 
negative  results.  The  in  vitro  assays  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  S2  (R1)  guideline, 
including  the  use  of  high  concentrations  of  test  material  that  caused  some  precipitation  in  the  assay 
incubations.  
There  was  concern  regarding  potential  for  in  vivo  genotoxic  effects  of  PA21  due  to  the  high  iron 
content  of  PA21  (approximately  20%  w/w),  the  high  oral  test  material  load  (40  mg  Fe/kg/day),  and 
the lack of absorption of the iron from the compound, as demonstrated by the data from the rat and 
dog pharmacokinetic studies. It has been postulated that excessive dietary iron could increase radical 
generation in the GI tract, leading to mucosal injury, genotoxicity and even neoplasia. These concerns 
warranted  a  robust  in  vivo  evaluation  of  the  genotoxic  potential  of  PA21.  Conduct  of  conventional  in 
vivo  genotoxicity  tests,  such  as  the  rodent  bone  marrow  micronucleus  test,  was  not  appropriate  or 
possible, due to lack of absorption/exposure of the bone marrow to PA21 or its components after oral 
administration.  Parenteral  (e.g.,  intravenous)  administration  of  PA21,  in  order  to  ensure  exposure  of 
the bone marrow, was not possible due to the very low solubility of the compound in any vehicle that 
was suitable for injection. In vivo assessment of genotoxic potential of PA21 therefore involved conduct 
of 2 ‘site of contact’ DNA damage tests (Comet assays), that examined potential for effects at the high 
local concentrations that may be encountered in the GI tract. These Comet assays were conducted in 
rats  at  dosages  of  PA21  up  to  20  times  the  intended  human  dose  (800  mg  Fe/kg),  and  revealed  no 
evidence  of  DNA  damage in  the  stomach,  duodenum    or  colon.  An  appropriate  positive  control  (ethyl 
methanesulfonate)  was  included  in  these  Comet  assays,  and  induced  significant  increases  in  DNA 
damage  in  all  tissues  examined,  thereby  demonstrating  validity  of  the  assays.  In  addition,  to 
supplement the Comet assay data, a peripheral blood reticulocyte micronucleus test was conducted as 
part  of  the  chronic  (26  week)  oral  toxicity  study  in  rats  (VFR096/072989).  No  increase  in  the 
proportion  of  peripheral  blood  reticulocytes  that  were  micronucleated  was  observed  after  4  or  24 
weeks of treatment at oral PA21 dosages up to 500 mg Fe/kg/day, whereas a positive control group of 
rats treated with cyclophosphamide showed a clear increase in micronuclei in the blood reticulocytes. 
Flow cytometric analysis of micronuclei in peripheral blood reticulocytes has been demonstrated to be 
as effective as conventional bone marrow analysis for in vivo detection of genotoxic chemicals, and has 
the advantage of being less labour intensive, and repeat analysis in the same animals is possible (e.g., 
during the course of a repeated-dose toxicity study). 
The  in  vivo  genotoxicity  tests  were  negative.  Overall,  it  would  have  been  more  informative  to  have 
performed the in vitro tests with the FeOOH part of the PA21 complex. It can be assumed that these 
inconsistent  findings  are  due  to  the  nature  of  the  substance,  and  it  is  therefore  not  considered 
relevant. Overall, a valid battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays, in accordance with the ICH 
S2 (R1) guideline has been conducted with PA21, including ‘site of contact’ assays in GI tissues. There 
was no evidence of genotoxic potential of PA21 (or PA21-2) in any of the assays conducted.

Mouse study 
In the mouse carcinogenicity study, treatment at all dosages was tolerated with no significant effect on 
survival. Termination of males after 101 weeks of treatment, and females after 104 weeks of 
Assessment report

treatment ensured that sufficient numbers of mice were available (more than 20/sex in most study 
groups) at termination for a meaningful assessment of tumour incidence to be carried out. The 
expected pharmacodynamics effects of PA21 were observed at urinanalysis investigations (markedly 
reduced phosphorus and increased calcium at all dosage levels). In the initial assessment by the study 
pathologist, terminal investigations revealed treatment-related hyperplastic and neoplastic changes in 
the caecum and colon. Hyperplastic changes were also seen in the non-glandular region of the stomach 
and in the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder at the high dosage level of 1,000 mg 
Fe/kg/day. A treatment-related increase in adenocarcinoma of the colon was observed at all dosages in 
males, and at the highest dose level (1,000 mg Fe/kg/day) in females. When a trend test was applied 
across all male study groups, the incidence of colon adenocarcinoma was significant at all dosage 
levels. An increased incidence of epithelial hyperplasia and mucosal diverticulum/cysts/hyperplasia was 
seen at the dosage levels at which treatment-related adenocarcinoma were observed. In the caecum, 
epithelial hyperplasia and diverticulum/cysts/hyperplasia were observed in mice of both sexes at 1,000 
mg Fe/kg/day, and the incidence of adenocarcinoma and/or adenoma was considered above historical 
background range (0% for adenoma, 0-1.7% for adenocarcinoma) for males at 500 and 1,000 mg 
Fe/kg/day. 
On this basis, a ‘no-effect’ dosage for induction of neoplastic changes in the large intestine was not 
established in the mouse carcinogenicity study, in view of the increased incidence of colon 
adenocarcinoma in males at 250 mg Fe/kg/day. There was a correlation between the PA21-induced 
hyperplasia and the presence of tumours in both the colon and caecum, suggesting that the neoplastic 
changes were part of a continuum that originated from chronic irritation, and subsequent proliferative 
response of the GI tract at the high oral dosages of PA21 administered. There was also evidence of 
local irritation in the non-glandular forestomach, with increased epithelial hyperplasia and 
hyperkeratosis in mice at 1,000 mg Fe/kg/day, but there was no effect of treatment on neoplastic 
findings in the stomach. As documented in the study report, an external peer review of the caecum 
and colon slides was performed, which confirmed the diagnoses and incidence of hyperplastic and 
neoplastic lesions reported by the testing laboratory.  
The role of the iron content of PA21 in the induction of the caecum and colon tumours in mice needs to 
be considered. Huang X, 2003 reviewed the evidence for dietary iron and iron overload having a role in 
cancer. With respect to colorectal cancer in humans, there seems to be conflicting evidence. Some 
studies have shown a positive correlation between dietary iron and body iron stores with colorectal 
cancer risk. Individuals with haemochromatosis, an iron storage disease, also showed increased 
relative risk of colorectal cancer. Other studies have shown no association between body iron levels, 
iron intake or serum ferritin levels and colorectal cancer risk. Studies in rodents show that dietary iron 
can cause oxidative stress and cell proliferation in the intestinal tissues, but in the absence of colon 
carcinogens, iron does not appear to induce colorectal cancer in its own right. 
Therefore, a role for the iron component of PA21 in the observed caecal and colonic tumours in mice 
remained equivocal. However, similar tumours were not induced in the rat carcinogenicity study, and 
chronic treatment of dogs at high PA21 dosages (up to 400 mg Fe/kg/day) showed no evidence of 
irritation, hyperplasia or neoplasia in the GI tract. Furthermore, given the lack of correlation between 
positive Perl’s staining and sites of hyperplasia or diverticula, this causal relationship is no longer likely. 
The applicant has performed a review of the histopathology slides of the adenocarcinoma samples of 
mice treated with PA21 by an expert in rodent toxicologic pathology and experimental carcinogenesis. 
It is stated that most of the tissue samples previously classed as adenocarcinomas, have been 
misclassified and should actually be termed “diverticula”. In fact after re-classification, there are 3 
instances of adenocarcinoma at the mid dose, and 1 at the high dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 28/112 
 
  
  
The re-classification and cellular/tissue characteristics on which this is based, are described by the 
expert pathologist recruited by the applicant. The four reconfirmed cases of adenocarcinoma comprised 
of proliferating cells with the affected mucosa extending into the gut lumen. In these adenocarcinomas 
there was increased mitosis, crowding of cells, loss of cellular polarity, anisokaryosis, hyperbasophilia, 
stromal invasion and cellular atypia. In contrast, diverticula are generally characterized by prominent 
mucus-filled cysts, with some localized distortion of tubular contour of the large intestine. The 
morphological features of the lesions classed as adenocarcinoma by the study pathologist but not 
reconfirmed by the expert, are identical to the diagnostic features of the diverticula, with the exception 
that the submucosal cystic glands herniated through the outer muscular tunic of the large intestine. 
These lesions did not have any other features commonly ascribed to malignancies, and should 
therefore not be classed as such. The reasoning laid out by the expert could be followed by the 
assessor, and it was agreed that there are actually 4 adenocarcinomas as described above. 
Regarding the relevancy of diverticula for humans, the expert states that this is likely due the high 
dietary burden of PA21, which is a bulky substance. Cysts develop and expand, producing mucus which 
displaced the crypt epithelium. With time and continued expansion together with intraluminal pressure 
due the continued treatment, some of the cysts penetrate the tunica muscularis. This phenomenon is 
unlikely to be relevant for humans, since the dose and therefore the intraluminal pressure is smaller in 
humans. Moreover, mice are known to be susceptible to the formation of diverticula due to irritation to 
the gut wall, or even spontaneously.  
A formal Pathology Working Group (PWG), comprising a PWG chairperson, the study pathologist, the 
reviewing expert, and 3 independent expert histopathologists, was held in order to determine the 
definitive diagnoses and incidence of the mouse GI tract tumours. As a result of the PWG review, 2 of 
the adenocarcinomas previously reported in the colon were reclassified as diverticula and one as an 
adenoma. The adenoma as well as the single adenocarcinoma were considered unlikely to be test 
article-related by the PWG. The PWG concluded that the dietary administration of PA21 to CD-1 mice 
resulted in a dosage-related increase in mucosal epithelial hyperplasia and development of diverticula 
with cysts. There was no clear evidence of a tumourigenic response in male mice and no evidence of a 
tumourigenic response in female mice in this study. The pattern of low grade mucosal proliferation in 
the large intestine of male and female mice is consistent with persistent low grade epithelial damage 
and repair due to the physical disruption by large amounts of material in the lower intestinal tract that 
was not absorbed after oral administration. Considering the anatomical and physiological differences in 
the large intestine in humans as compared to mice, the absence of proliferative changes in the large 
intestine of dogs, and the paucity of similar findings in the rat carcinogenicity study, the low grade 
proliferative changes in the caecum and colon of mice are species specific and not relevant to human 
risk. Overall, the conclusions of the PWG are endorsed; there is no tumorigenic response in mice 
related to the test substance PA21. 
Rat study 
Treatment at 40, 150 and 500 mg Fe/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study was tolerated, with 16 
and 9% reductions in weight gain at 500 mg Fe/kg/day in males and females, respectively. There was 
no adverse effect of treatment on survival, and termination of treatment after 103 weeks for males 
and 99 weeks for females ensured sufficient surviving animals were available at termination for a 
meaningful assessment of tumour incidence to be carried out. The expected pharmacodynamics effects 
of PA21 were observed at urinalysis investigations (markedly reduced phosphorus at the 150 and 500 
mg Fe/kg/day dosage levels). 
Terminal investigations in the rat carcinogenicity study revealed a statistically significant increase in 
the incidence of thyroid c-cell adenoma in males at 500 mg Fe/kg/day, the trend test across treated 
male groups also being positive for the incidence of this tumour.

The incidence of c-cell adenoma in males at 500 mg Fe/kg/day (21.9%) was greater than the historical 
background range for contemporary rat studies run at the test laboratory (range = 3.3-18.5%, n=757 
control rats). The historical ranges for c-cell adenoma quoted by Charles River Laboratories for control 
CD  rats  in  carcinogenicity  studies  are  1.4-14.8%  (mean  –  7.9%)  in  males  and  2.9-16.7%  (mean  – 
7.2%)  in  females.  Therefore,  the  incidence  of  c-cell  adenoma  in  all  the  treated  male  groups  in  the 
PA21  study  was  above  the  Charles  River  historical  control  range.  Intergroup  differences  in  the 
incidence of hyperplasia of the thyroid c-cells and hyperplasia of the parathyroid were also observed in 
this study. There was a slightly increased incidence/severity of c-cell hyperplasia amongst treated male 
groups,  whilst  in  the  parathyroid,  there  was  a  trend  towards  reduced  hyperplasia  in  the  high  dose 
treatment groups. The interpretation of the trends observed for thyroid c-cell and parathyroid changes 
in the rat carcinogenicity study needs to take into account the observed changes in clinical pathology 
parameters that relate to alterations in calcium and phosphate homeostasis induced by PA21, as well 
as  an  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  involved  in  calcium  and  phosphate  homeostasis  in  the body. 
As  discussed  previously,  as  a  result  of  PA21  reducing  the  uptake  of  phosphate  by  the  GI  tract,  the 
body will activate or up-regulate various compensatory mechanisms so as to maintain blood and tissue 
phosphate  at  physiological  levels.  The  lack  of  dietary  phosphate  uptake  in  the  PA21-treated  animals 
ultimately results in mobilisation of phosphate, and associated calcium ions, from the skeleton. This is 
clearly  apparent  from  the  clinical  pathology  and  bone  turnover  marker  data  from  the  rat  toxicity 
studies,  as  well  as  the  data  collected  as  part  of  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study.  Urinary  and,  to  some 
extent, serum calcium were increased at dosages of 150 and 500 mg Fe/kg/day, whilst bone markers 
(serum  osteocalcin  and  urinary  DPD)  and  serum  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D  levels  were  increased, 
clearly indicating that phosphate and calcium were being mobilised from the bone in order to maintain 
physiological phosphate levels. Apart from 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, serum calcium levels are closely 
controlled  by  PTH  from  the  parathyroid  gland,  and  calcitonin  secreted  by  the  c-cells  of  the  thyroid. 
Calcitonin secretion increases in response to elevated serum calcium levels in order to maintain serum 
calcium  levels  within  fairly  tight  limits  and  avoid  hypercalcaemia,  while  the  secretion  of  PTH  is 
suppressed,  slowing  calcium  release  and  bone  resorption.  Therefore,  the  non-neoplastic  changes 
observed  in  the  thyroid  and  parathyroid  glands  in  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study  probably  reflect  the 
expected  physiological  response  to  phosphate  depletion  and  consequent  mobilisation  of  phosphate 
(and  associated  calcium  ions)  from  the  bone,  namely  increased  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D3 
concentration, decreased PTH secretion and increased calcitonin secretion. 
On this basis, the slightly increased incidence of c-cell adenoma in males treated at the highest dose of 
PA21 in the rat carcinogenicity study is considered to be pharmacological in origin, and related to the 
compensatory  physiological  responses  to  phosphate  depletion  in  healthy  rats.  The  findings  are  not 
considered  to  be  of  relevance  to  the  target  patient  population,  as  the  response  to  PA21  in 
hyperphosphataemic renal failure patients will be different than in healthy, normophosphataemic, rats. 
In  addition,  PA21  did  not  affect  the  incidence  of  c-cell  carcinoma,  while  the  increased  incidence  of 
adenomata  in  male  rats  was  only  significant  at  a  multiple  (12.5-fold)  of  the  maximum  likely  human 
therapeutic dose, and only slightly exceeded the historical control incidence of this tumour. No effect of 
PA21 on c-cell tumours was observed in female rats. Proliferation of c-cells is a common spontaneous 
finding in rats, but not in mice, which may explain why PA21 exerted no effect on c-cells in the mouse 
carcinogenicity study. Rat carcinogenicity studies conducted with calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) 
showed hyperplasia and adenomata in the c-cells of the thyroid, consistent with the calcaemic effect of 
the  vitamin  (leading  to  increased  calcitonin  secretion),  and  the  changes  were  considered  to  be  rat-
specific.  A  possible  direct  effect  of  vitamin  D  or  its  metabolites  on  the  growth  of  c-cells  has  been 
proposed, and rats fed a vitamin D-deficient diet show lower spontaneous incidence of c-cell tumours 
than  control  rats.  These  observations  further  support  the  concept  that the  c-cell  findings  in  the  PA21 
rat carcinogenicity study are pharmacological in origin, species-specific and are unlikely to be relevant 
to patients given PA21 at the proposed doses.

Treatment-related increases in the incidence of epithelial hyperplasia were observed in the duodenum, 
caecum,  colon  and  rectum  in  animals  treated  at  500  mg  Fe/kg/day  in  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study, 
with  submucosal  inflammation  also  being  present  in  the  caecum,  colon  and  rectum  at  this  dosage. 
However, in contrast to the mouse study, no increase in neoplastic lesions was observed in the GI tract 
tissues of rats. 
Tumour findings in the long term rat study are limited to a small increase in C-cell adenomas in males 
at  the  highest  dose  of  500  mg  Fe/kg/day.  The  applicant  argues  that  this  effect  is  pharmacologically 
related. The decrease in uptake of phosphate from the diet will lead to mobilization of phosphate and 
calcium  from  bone,  to  normalize  the  blood  concentration  of  phosphate.  Hypercalcaemia  will  lead  to 
increased secretion of calcitonin from c-cells in the thyroid, which in leads to hyperplasia which could 
develop into neoplasia. This explanation can be followed, and relevance for ESRD patients is therefore 
considered unlikely. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
There  was  no  effect  on  male  or  female  fertility  or  early  embryonic  development  from  treatment  with 
PA21.  The  slight  increase  in  post-implantation  losses  was  due  to  an  abnormal  litter  with  high  late 
resorption. This was not considered treatment-related. 
In  the  rat  embryo-foetal  development  study,  the  only  effects  observed  were  a  decrease  in  plasma 
phosphorous  levels  which  is  pharmacologically-related,  and  increased  Fe  levels  in  the  liver  of  both 
dams  and  foetuses.  Raised  Fe  levels  in  dams  are  not  surprising,  as  similar  findings  were  seen  in  the 
repeated  dose  studies.  Increased  liver  Fe  content  in  the  foetuses  however,  raises  some  concern. 
However, there were no other signs of toxicity, and no increased Fe content in rabbit foetuses or in rat 
offspring in the peri- & postnatal development study.  
In  the  rabbit  embryo-foetal  development  study,  there  was  an  increased  incidence  of  some  skeletal 
variations,  namely  cranial  fissures/extra  sutures  and  incompletely  ossified  metacarpals/phalanges,  at 
the highest dose. A decrease in foetal body weight was also seen at this dose. These adverse effects 
coincided  with  the  pharmacologically-related  effect  of  decreased  plasma  phosphorous  levels  in  the 
pregnant females, which is most likely the cause of the foetal effects.  
In  the  pre-  and  postnatal  study  in  rats,  no  effects  were  observed  in  any  of  the  parameters  for 
development  or  reproduction  function  of  the  offspring  of  rats  treated  with  PA21.  A  slight  decrease  in 
body weight in the F1 males is likely not treatment-related, as no such effect was seen in females, and 
this effect was only seen at later stages of development and not during the lactation period. Decreased 
plasma  phosphorous  of  the  F0  females  is  not  considered  adverse  effects,  and  therefore,  no  adverse 
effects were seen in this study. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Only radioactivity was measured after oral administration of radiolabelled Velphoro. Data from rat and 
dog  indicate  a  low  absorption,  but  distribution  of  radioactivity  was  observed  to  some  organs  (liver, 
spleen  and  the  walls  of  the  gastro-intestinal  tract).  Since  the  applicant  only  measured  the 
radioactivity, it is unclear what was measured (Fe, FeO(OH) or (nano) particle). See kinetic section. 
The  chemical  structure  of  the  radioactivity  absorbed  will  influence  the  interpretation  of  the  toxicity 
and kinetic studies. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance effects are discussed in detail in the carcinogenicity section of this report. No specific 
local tolerance studies have been performed. Local tolerability in the GI tract was assessed as part of 
the repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs and in a GI tract transit time study in rats (Study 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 31/112 
 
  
  
VFR085/052415). 
Other toxicity studies 
No other additional non-clinical safety studies have been performed on PA21, this is agreed with the 
CHMP. 
2.1.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Carbohydrates like sucrose and starches are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant 
risk  to  the  environment  (EMEA  2006).  Therefore,  only  the  polynuclear  iron(III)-oxyhydroxide  (pn-
FeOOH)  needs  further  consideration.  Since  Fe  is  an  (essential)  metal,  the  PBT  assessment  is  not 
needed.  The  PEC  in  the  influent  of  the  STP  is  estimated  at  0.024  mg/L.  Against  a  background 
concentration  of  phosphate  (P)  of  8  mg/L  in  STP  influent  in  the  Netherlands  (CBS  2007),  an 
environmental risk assessment is deemed not necessary, given the nature of the active ingredient that 
is binds to phosphate. It is also considered that in sewage treatment plants where chemical phosphate 
binding is required, iron salts are added to the influent water in an Fe/P ratio of 3:2. At 8 mg P/L iron 
would be added at a concentration of approximately 22 mg/L. 
Therefore, the use of Velphoro is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.1.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Iron absorption through release of iron from the PA21 substance was a point of concern. It was shown 
in in vitro studies that up to 10% of iron can be released and absorbed, which corresponds to 300 mg 
Fe/day. This is far in excess of the recommended daily dose of 18 mg Fe. Although iron accumulation 
(2-fold)  was  seen  in  systemic  organs  in  the  non-clinical  species,  no  toxicity  was  evident.  During  the 
assessment it has been shown that no more than  0.04% of the iron will be absorbed systemically by 
patients.  As  this  is  very  low,  there  is  no  longer  a  concern  regarding  iron  accumulation  in  patients, 
however  the  applicant  will  perform  a  post-authorisation  study  in  patients  will  monitor  the  long  term 
safety study longer than 1 year and the iron accumulation. 
Also relevant in this respect is the form in which the Fe is absorbed. Since the radiolabel was attached 
to  the  Fe  component  in  the  substance  and  only  radioactivity  was  measured,  there  is  no  information 
available  in  which  form  the  radioactivity  is  present  in  the  distribution  studies,  and  this  could  be 
elemental  Fe,  Fe(O)OH,  Fe(O)OH  (nano)particle  or  even  PA21.  However,  the  iron,  measured  as 
radioactivity shows a distribution pattern essentially similar to normal iron, where most of radioactivity 
is  present  in  organs of  the  RES,  i.e.  red  blood  cells  and  spleen.  Moreover,  radioactivity levels  decline 
over  time,  indicating  normal  metabolism,  rather  than  trapping  and  storage  of  particles.  Further, 
additional in vitro data not be needed as the applicant provided long term in vivo data, which provide 
evidence not only of a pharmacokinetic profile similar to iron, but also of a lack of systemic toxicity as 
a  result  of  chronic  administration  of  PA21.  It  is  therefore  considered  that  the  risk  of  systemic  iron 
accumulation due to uncontrolled uptake of nanoparticles is very low. Monitoring of this potential risk 
was proposed by the applicant to be included in the RMP; this was agreed by the CHMP. 
Further  considerations  by  the  Applicant  presented  explanation  of  performed  in  vitro  DDI  studies  of 
selected  medicines  and  their  bounding  classification  while  adding  relevant  statements  in  the  SmPC 
concerning  interactions  with  iron.  The  proposed  information  in  the  section  4.5  in  the  SmPC  was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
There was concern regarding adenocarcinomas in the colon of mice. A re-examination of these lesions 
was performed by the applicant, resulting in a re-classification of a large part of the adenocarcinomas 
to  diverticula  lesions  and  hyperplasia.  A  further  re-evaluation  was  performed  by  a  pathology  working 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014

group (PWG) with 6 independent experts through the Applicant. In general, the re-classification by the 
PWG  in  which  only  a  single  adenocarcinoma  was  identified  in  group  3,  was  considered  acceptable  by 
the CHMP.  
Overall, the conclusions of the PWG are endorsed by the CHMP; i.e. that there is no tumorigenic 
response in mice related to the test substance PA21. To further assess whether the colon and caecum 
hyperplasia and diverticula are test article related and/or relevant for humans, it is shown that there is 
no correlation between positive Perls’ staining and intestinal lesions. It is also shown that Perls’ 
staining is capable of detecting iron present as particles. Taken together, it is considered unlikely that 
the lesions are a result of absorbed iron and/or particles in the intestinal wall. A more likely 
explanation for the lesions is the bulky nature of the substance which was administered at high doses 
causing irritation of the intestinal wall. The relevance for humans is considered low due to the 
difference in anatomy between humans and mice. However, monitoring of this potential risk in humans 
is needed. A PASS performed by the applicant will provide relevant data to further characterise this 
potential risk. 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
No juvenile studies were conducted. Studies in juvenile “healthy” animals are unlikely to add any 
useful information with regard to potential extra risks for CKD patients. Omission of studies in juvenile 
animals is considered to be justified. 
2.1.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data provided support are acceptable to support the marketing authorisation for 
Velphoro.  
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The applicant declared that the phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies were conducted in accordance with 
the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, including amendments in force up to and including the 
time the study was conducted. The applicant declared that the studies were conducted in compliance 
with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products guideline (CPMP/ICH/135/95), and compliant with 
the EU Clinical Trial Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC) and the Code of Federal Regulations for informed 
consent and protection of patient rights (21 CFR, Parts 50 and 56). 
In study PA-CL-05A, one study centre 701, located in Lithuania, was closed due to a GCP issue. Data 
from subjects enrolled at Centre 701 were included in the analyses as, following a GCP audit carried 
out by Vifor Pharma. A triggered GCP inspection in relation to the pivotal studies PA-CL-05A and PA-
CL-05B was made. The inspection was scheduled at two investigator sites (Russia and Ukraine) and at 
the sponsor sites in Switzerland and in the UK. This was based on the outcome of the IR that 
concluded that the clinical data of Russian and Ukrainian sites are not acceptable for an assessment on 
the benefit/risk of Velphoro. An in-depth sensitivity analysis and reassessment of the benefit/risk of

the product, excluding all Russian and Ukrainian sites, were made by the Applicant as requested by the 
CHMP.  The results of the analyses were reassuring and confirmed the validity of the data within the 
dossier for the benefit/risk discussion of the product. 
 Tabular overview of clinical studies  
The clinical development program of Velphoro included 9 completed clinical studies which are relevant 
within the current application (Table 1). Long term safety data up to 28 weeks (PA-CL05B) were also 
submitted in support of the MAA; this study will provide relevant data on long-term safety over at least 
1 year of follow-up. Two short-term clinical studies were performed in Japan (one phase 1 PK study for 
7 days (n=30) and one phase 2 dose finding study for 6 weeks (n=146)) of which only a study 
synopsis and tables were included as supportive data. These studies were only briefly searched for 
additional safety events, and shortly mentioned where relevant. 
Within the 9 clinical studies, a total of 1,112 healthy volunteers and patients received at least 1 dose of 
Velphoro. Of those, a total of 707 patients received up to 27 weeks of study medication in the single 
Phase 3 study.   
Note on denotation:  
• 
In the clinical studies, the strength of the tablets was expressed on the basis of the approximate total 
mass of the drug substance in the tablet – either as a 1.25 g/tablet, or as a 2.50 g/tablet. Within the 
report, the dose is expressed based on this total mass of drug substance. However, the fixed and 
defined value was always the iron content, and as it is the iron that binds phosphate, the iron content 
in the tablet is quantitatively assayed and controlled. Therefore, within the SmPC the iron content is 
mentioned which is more pharmacologically correct and is consistent with the dose presentation of the 
phosphate binder lanthanum carbonate.

2.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
To support the pharmacokinetics of Velphoro, the following studies have been submitted: 
Study Q-24120:  An open label safety study with 59Fe labelled PA21 in patients with chronic kidney 
disease and healthy volunteers. 
PA-DDI-001:  A single-centre, open-label, 3-period study of the pharmacokinetic effect of PA21 on 
losartan potassium in healthy male and female adults. 
PA-DDI-002:  A single-centre, open-label, 3-period study of the pharmacokinetic effect of PA21 on 
furosemide in healthy male and female adults. 
PA-DDI-003:  A single-centre, open-label, 3-period study of the pharmacokinetic effect of PA21 on 
omeprazole in healthy male and female adults. 
PA-DDI-004:  A single-centre, open-label, 3-period study of the pharmacokinetic effect of PA21 on 
digoxin in healthy male and female adults. 
PA-DDI-005:  A single-centre, open-label, 3-period study of the pharmacokinetic effect of PA21 on 
warfarin in healthy male and female adults. 
Furthermore, adsorptions of several medicinal products to Velphoro have been studied in vitro in 
several studies. Pharmacokinetic variables, e.g. AUC0-t, AUCinf, Cmax, t½, if applicable, were 
calculated according to standard procedures. In case of comparability, standard 90% confidence 
intervals were applied. 
Absorption 
• 
Bioavailability 
The absorption of iron after administration of PA21 has been evaluated using 59FE-PA21 in study Q-
24120. In this study two groups were included, i.e. healthy volunteers and patients. The latter were 
patients with chronic kidney disease, i.e. 8 pre-dialysis patients (stage 3 or 4) with glomerular filtration 
rate <60 ml/min (as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) and 8 haemodialysis patients (serum

ferritin levels 200 – 800 µg/l and/or having transferrin saturation in the range of 20 – 50%). Healthy 
volunteers were required to have serum ferritin <100 µg/l with no underlying disease. 
Before drug administration, for patients on other phosphate-binding agents, a washout period of 7 
days was applied. 
PA21 as suspension, was administered during 7 days at a dose of 10 g daily with meals (breakfast, 
lunch, diner) in 3 divided doses, i.e. 2.5 g, 5g and 2.5 g, corresponding to 500 mg, 1000 mg and 500 
mg iron (total dose 2000 mg) per day. Healthy subject received at day 1 PA21 as 59FE labelled iron 
and the patients at day 7. One patient on haemodialysis did not take one dose at day 2. 
Blood samples were taken at day 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after administration of the labelled dose. 59Fe 
activity in plasma and blood was measured by a gamma counter.  
The total amount of circulating 59Fe was calculated based upon estimated blood volume, radioactivity 
in blood and amount of radioactivity administered. 
The radioactivity in blood versus time is shown in figure PK 2.  
Figure PK 2. Circulating radioactivity in blood in healthy volunteers, patients on haemodialysis and pre-
dialysis patients as a function of time after administration (mean of 8 subjects per group; error 
bar=s.d.). 
In healthy volunteers, after administration of 59FE labelled PA21, recovery of radioactivity in blood was 
low and ranged from 0.16 – 1.25% of the administered dose. After about 2 weeks, drug recovery did 
not increase.  In patients absorption was much lower and ranged from 0 – 0.44% of the administered 
dose.  
The difference in exposure may be explained by possible saturation of uptake at steady state but also 
due to the fact that iron absorption is related to iron stores and ferrin concentration, i.e. high ferrin 
Assessment report

concentrations related to low absorption of iron, and the renal patients have higher ferrin 
concentrations.  
Low levels of radioactivity in plasma were observed indicative for absorption of iron in erythrocytes.   
The multiple dose study in patients will reflect the clinical situation for patients. The administered dose 
is in line with the recommendations. In addition, possible non-linearity in uptake during multiple-dose 
is covered. 
Based upon the maximal observed uptake in renally impaired patients, i.e. 0.44% of the administered 
dose, and taken into account that the maximum recommended dose is 3,000 mg (6 tablets) per day, a 
daily uptake of 13.2 mg can be expected. The applicant used a 0.1% uptake value translating into 
about 2 mg iron/day (using a 2000 mg dose). The applicant indicated that this is lower than the 
normal recommended intake of 5 mg/day. However, recommended maximal daily intake in females 
may be as high as 18 mg/day (see also assessment report module 4). Still, from these data it cannot 
be ruled out that due to treatment with PA21 recommended maximal intake of iron will be higher than 
normally recommended. The patients will be monitored for high iron accumulation. 
Radio-activity was measured to evaluate the systemic absorption of iron. However, after 7 days and 
even after 14 days radioactivity levels increased in blood. As normally the transit time of a drug trough 
the gastro-intestinal tract is less than 2 days, it is unclear how levels after 14 days can increase. This 
should be explained. Furthermore, excretion data (mass balance) is lacking. Systemic absorption was 
estimated based upon blood volume and the concentration of radioactivity in blood, however in this 
case it should be assumed that iron is not distributed. As this is not the case, absorption of iron may 
be higher than estimated in this study. The Applicant was asked to submit reports on main 
characteristics of radioanalytical methods employed in pharmacokinetic studies (both nonclinical and 
clinical) according to current guidelines, as well as validation reports of analytical methods of losartan, 
furosemide, omeprazole, digoxin and warfarin. Details of the sensitivity of gamma measurements of 
blood samples and estimation of administered radioactivity and effective dose in Study Q-24120 were 
provided. However, no requested validation reports of radioanalytical methods were included into 
Applicant’s response.  
As only the radioactivity of the labelled iron is measured, it is considered that this method cannot 
elucidate whether iron is absorbed as nanoparticles or not.  
•  Comparison of trial formulations with finished product 
Two formulations were used during the development. The early formulation used in study Q-2120 and 
VIT-CI-01/02 contained PA21-1 as drug substance.  
For the formulation used in the drug-drug interaction studies and the pivotal study PA-CL-05A, the 
manufacturing process of the drug substance was amended drug substance PA21-2).  
Quality data indicated comparable iron release, structure, oxidative state, hydration state, particle size 
and stability for the formulations. A limited programme of non-clinical “bridging” studies showed that 
PA21-2 behaved in a similar manner to PA21-1 in terms of toxicity profile, genotoxic potential, and iron 
uptake/absorption.  
Considering that iron absorption is very low and taking into account that the PA21 acts locally in the 
gastro-intestinal tract, and taken into account the submitted quality data (see module 3) and non-
clinical data (see module 4) no difference in clinical activity is expected between the different 
formulations. In addition, in the pivotal phase III study the commercial tablet formulation PA21-2 has 
been used.

•  Influence of food 
In vitro data suggest that iron release predominantly occurs at low pH (similar to the gastric fasting 
state. Under fed conditions, absorption of iron is considered very low. At low pH there may be a 
possible higher iron release and thus absorption, however Velphoro should be administered with food 
this is reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  Furthermore, patients will be monitored for (too) high iron 
accumulation. 
Distribution 
Distribution studies in humans were not performed. Absorbed iron is expected to follow the normal iron 
distribution pathways. 
Biotransformation 
The therapeutic moiety of Velphoro, pn-FeOOH, is not metabolised. However, the degradation product 
of Velphoro, mononuclear iron species, can be released from the surface of polynuclear iron 
(III)-oxyhydroxide and be absorbed. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the systemic absorption 
of iron from Velphoro is low. 
In vitro data suggest that the sucrose and starch components of the drug substance can be digested to 
glucose and fructose, and maltose and glucose, respectively. These compounds can be absorbed in the 
blood. 
Elimination 
• 
Metabolism 
Polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide 
Iron(III)-oxyhydroxides is microbiologically not stable as an aqueous suspension and is dehydrated 
when dried or stored, which results in a decrease of the phosphate binding capacity. Therefore, the 
iron(III)-oxyhydroxide alone cannot be isolated and stored as an active pharmaceutical ingredient 
(API). Sucrose is added to the iron compound to stabilize the iron core and thus maintain the high 
phosphate adsorption capacity. Starches are added as processing aids to allow for isolation, 
characterisation and stability testing of the drug substance. PA21 is partly soluble in water, release 
sucrose, starch and iron(III)-oxyhydroxide. Polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide is practically insoluble 
and therefore iron cannot be absorbed. The extent of iron release from an iron(III)-oxyhydroxide 
suspension was compared to that from Velphoro. Iron release from Velphoro in vitro was significantly 
lower than from iron(III)-oxyhydroxide under acidic conditions (pH 3.0); 1.2% versus 4.6% iron 
release. 
Sucrose 
Upon oral administration, sucrose is digested by sucrase or isomaltase glycoside hydrolase to glucose 
and fructose in the microvilli of the duodenum. Incubation of Velphoro with sucrase resulted in 
complete degradation of sucrose into glucose and fructose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 39/112 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Starch 
Upon oral administration, the starches are digested to maltose and glucose by amylase, which is 
present in the digestive juices (e.g. mouth). The degradation of starch was only partial, but did not 
differ between Velphoro-2 and starch alone. 
Velphoro 
Velphoro and various mixtures of iron(III)-oxyhydroxide, starch and/or sucrose were exposed to 
porcine pancreatin and rat intestinal mucosa, and analysed for glucose release (see assessment report 
module 3). The percentage of formed glucose from Velphoro concurred with the values expected from 
its individual components. In summary, the data indicate that Velphoro behaves like a mixture of its 
components and that the carbohydrates stabilise the iron(III)-oxyhydroxide core. As indicated before, 
iron is almost not absorbed from Velphoro. The major part is considered to be eliminated via faeces.

Special populations

Impaired renal function 
Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in patients with end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD). Data for other renal subpopulations are not expected. 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
Considering that iron is almost not absorbed from Velphoro, an impaired liver function is considered 
not to affect the pharmacokinetics and systemic exposure of iron. Furthermore, patients will be 
monitored for (too) high iron accumulation.

The majority of the subjects (285/291) in the PK trials were <65 years. The Applicant marked that age 
distribution in the controlled trials was broadly representative of the dialysis patient population, with 
the majority (845/1,209) being aged <65 years and few (8/1,209) being ≥85 years. There was no 
upper age limit in the protocols for these studies, thus ensuring that the age distribution is appropriate 
to the population. The age group > 85 years is least represented (5/835) in controlled trials, as well as 
age group 75-84 (68/835).  
•  Children 
The safety and efficacy of Velphoro in children below the age of 18 years has not yet been established 
(as described in the product information). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The various in vitro drug-drug interaction studies, showed no significant adsorption/binding of 
ciprofloxacin, clopidogrel, enalapril, digoxin, metoprolol, nifedipine, omeprazole, simvastatin, warfarin, 
hydrochlorothiazide, metformin or quinidine to PA21. In addition, no adsorption was found for 
cinacalcet and glipizide, though results were inconclusive at some pH values. Moderate adsorption to 
PA21 was observed for pioglitazone. A strong binding was observed for furosemide, losartan, 
atorvastatin, doxycycline, alendronate, cephalexin, levothyroxine, doxercalciferol and paricalcitol. 
Adding phosphate to the solution reduced the interaction between PA21 and levothyroxine, paricalcitol 
and atorvastatin, possibly due to competing with binding sites.

The lack of a clinically relevant interaction was confirmed in vivo for digoxin, omeprazole and warfarin. 
Although an interaction in vitro was observed for furosemide and losartan, in vivo no interaction is 
observed. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The active substance in PA21 is a mixture of iron(III)-oxyhydroxide (pn-FeOOH), sucrose and starches. 
In the aqueous environment of the GI tract, phosphate binding takes place by ligand exchange 
between hydroxyl groups and/or water and the phosphate ions. This results in phosphate excretion 
with the faeces, thereby preventing phosphate absorption. In more detail, it appears that PA21 binds 
phosphate by two separate mechanisms. The first mechanism is simple adsorption of phosphate to the 
iron complex. The second mechanism is the formation of FePO4. Which mechanism occurs depends on 
the pH. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology was studied in vitro and in vivo in animal studies. In summary, in vitro studies 
demonstrated efficient phosphate binding by PA21 under simulated GI tract conditions (pH range of 
1.2 to 8.5). The phosphate binding capacity appeared comparable to currently available phosphate 
binders. In vivo studies in a rat model of chronic renal failure showed that PA21 reduced urinary 
phosphorus excretion, increased faecal phosphorus excretion, and reduced arterial calcification. The 
effects on serum phosphorus levels were less obvious in this model.     
2.2.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PA21 is non-calcium, iron based phosphate binder, with a different mechanism of action compared to 
that of sevelamer. It includes both adsorption of phosphate to the iron complex and formation of 
FePO4, dependent on pH. Phosphate binding by PA21 was demonstrated under simulated GI tract 
conditions (pH range of 1.2 to 8.5) and appeared comparable to currently available phosphate binders. 
Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract appears low. Preclinical absorption, distribution and excretion 
study results were reassuring and analysis showed absorption of radioactivity was low, highest 
radioactivity levels in blood were 1.4% of the administered dose this did not indicate significant iron (-
particle) absorption. 
No beneficial secondary pharmacological effects were demonstrated. In vivo, drug-drug interaction 
studies with losartan, furosemide, digoxin, warfarin and omeprazole, co-administered with PA21 
showed no effect on absorption of losartan, furosemide, digoxin, warfarin and omeprazole. The 
interaction potential appears low based on in vitro and in vivo studies, although it is not clear to which 
extent interactions can be ruled out in vivo. Safety pharmacology studies did not show any significant 
effects on respiratory, central nervous system, or gastrointestinal motility parameters. Gastrointestinal 
effects are expected based on the local mechanism of action. The safety profile is further discussed in 
the safety section. 
Although  age  group  of  >  85  is  clearly  underrepresented  and  PK  studies  in  age  group  >75  years  are 
absent,  these  facts  could  be  acceptable  for  the  premarketing  assessment  but  should  be  elaborated 
further post marketing through the PASS Long-term usage beyond 1 year. 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014

The interaction potential seems low, but possible interactions cannot be completely ruled out, and this 
may be especially of concern with narrow therapeutic drugs. In SmPC section 4.5 this is covered. In 
addition, as a precaution, it is stated that Velphoro is almost not absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract. When administering any medicinal product that is known to interact with iron, the medicinal 
product should be administered at least one hour before or two hours after Velphoro.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PA21 is non-calcium, iron based phosphate binder, with a different mechanism of action compared to 
that of sevelamer. It includes both adsorption of phosphate to the iron complex and formation of 
FePO4, dependent on pH. Velphoro should be taken in conjunction with meals this is reflected in the 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. The interaction potential seems low, but it is not clear to which extent 
interactions can be ruled out in vivo. As a precaution, it is stated that Velphoro is not absorbed from 
the gastrointestinal tract. When administering any medicinal product that is known to interact with 
iron, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or two hours after 
Velphoro. The interaction potential is discussed in SmPC section 4.5. In addition, it is stated that 
Velphoro is almost not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. When administering any medicinal 
product that is known to interact with iron, the medicinal product should be administered at least one 
hour before or two hours after Velphoro.  
Clinical efficacy 
2.2.6.  Dose response study 
Study PA-CL-03: An Open-label, Randomised, Active-controlled Multicentre Phase 2 Dose Finding 
Study to Evaluate the Ability of PA21 to Lower Serum Phosphate Levels and the Tolerability in Patients 
with Chronic Kidney Disease on Maintenance Haemodialysis. 
Study participants: Adult (≥18 years) patients with ESRD on haemodialysis treatment 3 times a 
week for ≥3 months, receiving stable doses of phosphate binder (with or without Vitamin D) and 
having stable calcium content in dialysate for at least 1 month before screening were eligible for this 
study after having provided signed and dated informed consent. Patients had to be on a stable dose of 
Vitamin D, Vitamin D metabolites or calcimimetics for at least 1 month. Patients had to be on restricted 
phosphate diet.  If receiving therapy with erythropoietin, patients had to be on a stable dose (±25% 
dose adjustments compared to dose at screening) for at least 1 month before screening and had to 
remain on a stable dose (±25% dose adjustments, compared to dose at baseline) throughout the 
study. 
Only patients with serum phosphorus levels >1.78 mmol/L  at the end of the washout phase (Week -1, 
second dialysis session (D2) or third dialysis session (D3) of the calendar week)  were eligible for 
randomization.  
Major exclusion criteria included uncontrolled hyperphosphataemia (>2.5 mmol/L), hypercalcaemia 
(serum calcium >2.5 mmol/L) or serum calcium below 1.9 mmol/L (7.6 mg/dL), severe 
hyperparathyroidism (intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels >600 ng/L) at screening, iron 
deficiency anaemia defined as haemoglobin <10 g/dL and (ferritin <100 ng/mL or transferrin 
saturation (TSAT) <20%) at screening, history of haemochromatosis, or history of other iron storage 
disorders. Further exclusion criteria were significant gastrointestinal disorders including motility 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014

disorders, history of major gastrointestinal surgery in the past 5 years, active hepatitis B/C or other 
significant hepatic disorders (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3 
times the upper limit of the normal range at screening), known seropositivity to human 
immunodeficiency virus, active infection or treatment with antibiotics at screening, serious medical 
conditions or planned major surgery that would interfere with the study, pregnancy, lactation or lack of 
effective contraception. 
Use of antacids containing aluminium or magnesium within 1 month before screening, and use of oral 
iron preparations within 1 month before screening were not allowed as these could interfere with the 
assessment of phosphorus lowering efficacy. Subjects taking medication for treatment of moderate to 
severe arrhythmic and seizure disorders according to the Investigator’s judgment were excluded, in 
line with the warnings and precautions section within the SmPC of Renagel and Renvela. Use of 
sevelamer (as Renagel or Renvela) within 3 months before screening and treatment with lanthanum 
carbonate (Fosrenol) at any time during the subject’s life was not allowed.  
Inclusion criteria were representative for the target population in need of phosphate binder treatment 
and in line with current KDOQI treatment guidelines. Patients with significant GI and liver co-morbidity 
or iron storage disorders were excluded from the trial. Further, patients using sevelamer and 
lanthanum carbonate and patients on PD were excluded from the study. Therefore, some selection of 
patients occurred of which the impact on the results is not known. However, these restrictions are 
assumed not to have a major impact on the results and can be considered acceptable for the dose-
finding study. These patients were included in the pivotal phase 3 study. Iron infusion which is 
commonly seen within the target population, was also not allowed within this short-term phase 2 
study. However, this was allowed within the phase 3 study, reflecting daily clinical practice.  
Treatments: The study consisted of a screening phase (up to 1 week), a phosphate binder washout 
phase of 2 weeks, a 6-week treatment phase, and a 2-week run-out phase (Figure 1). The study visits 
took place on the day of the subject’s dialysis sessions. During the treatment phase and the run-out 
phase, study visits took place on the day of the first dialysis session of the week.  
Subjects eligible for treatment were randomized at Week 1, first dialysis session (D1) via an interactive 
voice response system (IVRS). Eligible subjects were randomized to either treatment with PA21 
chewable tablets containing 1.25 g PA21 and 250 mg iron (five dosing groups) or sevelamer (HCl, 
Renagel) 800 mg tablets.  
Subjects were withdrawn if their serum phosphorus levels exceeded the upper safety limit of 2.75 
mmol/L at any time as of 2 weeks after the start of treatment, or decreased below the lower safety 
limit of 1.13 mmol/L at any time after the start of treatment. Subjects were also withdrawn if their 
serum calcium levels exceeded the upper safety limit of 2.5 mmol/L at any time after the washout 
period.  The run-out phase was stopped prematurely if a subject’s serum phosphorus level exceeded 
the upper safety limit of 2.75 mmol/L.

Figure 1: Schematic presentation of study design PA-CL-03A 
Dosing: Patients were randomized to one of the 6 dosing groups as described in Figure 1.  Dosing 
frequency was three times daily, except for the lowest dose of PA21 which was administered once 
daily. No dose adjustments were allowed. 
The dose range of PA21 investigated covers a 2.5-fold range as the lowest dose is assumed to be 
ineffective. Sevelamer is widely used as phosphate binder and inclusion of this arm allows an 
exploratory comparison to a standard treatment. The dose of sevelamer is acceptable, although 
patients with baseline levels between 1.76-2.42 mmol/L are recommended a lower starting dose of 2.4 
g/day. Safety limits were set for hypophosphatemia and the treatment period was relatively short. 
The washout and treatment period are considered sufficient to observe changes in serum phosphorus 
levels. 
Primary objective: To investigate the ability of different doses of PA21 to lower serum phosphorus 
levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on maintenance haemodialysis. 
Secondary objectives: To assess the efficacy/safety profiles of the different doses of PA21. 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
The change from baseline in serum phosphorus levels at the end of treatment was defined as the 
primary efficacy endpoint. This endpoint was calculated by the change from baseline (week 1, first 
visit) to last value on treatment (week 7 first visit, or last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) for 
missing values).  
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
Secondary efficacy endpoints related to serum phosphorus level included: 
•  Change from baseline in serum phosphorus levels at each time point 
• 
Proportion of subjects achieving controlled serum phosphorus levels (i.e., ≥1.13 to ≤1.78 mmol/L 
(≥3.5 to ≤5.5 mg/dL)) at each time point 
•

Other secondary endpoints were: 
•  Serum total calcium levels; at each time point and change from baseline 
•  Serum calcium x phosphorus product; at each time point and change from baseline 
•  Serum iPTH levels; at each time point and change from baseline 
Safety endpoints: 
These included incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), clinically relevant 
changes in vital signs and clinically relevant changes in laboratory evaluations. Adverse events that 
began or that worsened in severity after at least 1 dose of study treatment had been administered 
were considered treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE). 
The primary and secondary endpoints are the commonly used pharmacodynamic endpoints for the 
intended treatment.  
Sample size: 
A sample size of 19 subjects per group (total of 114 subjects), with at least 1 post-baseline efficacy 
measurement, was determined to be sufficient for an alpha of 0.05 and 90% power to detect a 0.65 
mmol/L change in serum phosphorus, assuming an SD of 0.81 mmol/L using a 2-sided single sample t-
test and testing treatment doses from the highest to lowest in an hierarchical manner. It was planned 
to randomize up to 132 subjects, based on the assumption that approximately 14% of subjects would 
drop out after randomization without having at least 1 post-baseline efficacy measurement.  
Blinding: An open-label design was used because of challenges in maintaining blinding of study 
treatment. These were due to differences in the modes of administration of the 2 study treatments 
(PA21 tablets are chewed and then swallowed whereas sevelamer (HCl) tablets are swallowed whole) 
and the expected discoloration of faeces with PA21 because of its iron content. The open-label design 
is not considered to bias the primary efficacy endpoint of serum phosphorus, because this is an 
objective laboratory measurement which was analyzed by a central laboratory.  
Statistical methods:  
Populations analysed: 
The safety set (SS) consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
treatment.  
The Full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
treatment and had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy evaluation (while on treatment). 
The Per-protocol set (PPS) consisted of all FAS subjects, who were compliant with the study protocol, 
i.e., subjects without any major protocol deviations.  
Primary analysis: 
The efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS and on the PPS.  
The absolute change from baseline in serum phosphorus levels at the end of treatment (i.e., value at 
Week 7, or last observation carried forward (LOCF) for missing values) was analysed within each of the 
5 PA21 dose groups using a single sample paired t-test. To preserve the overall alpha, a hierarchical 
testing procedure was applied, testing from the highest PA21 dose (12.5 g/day) to the lowest dose 
(1.25 g/day). The same analysis was performed for the sevelamer group.

The safety analyses were performed on the SS. Summaries of safety data were provided per 
treatment group and also for the pooled PA21 group. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize 
treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), findings of physical examinations, vital signs and laboratory 
measurements (including shift tables with respect to normal ranges). 
Secondary analyses: 
The absolute change from baseline in serum phosphorus levels at the end of treatment (i.e., value at 
Week 7, D1, or LOCF for missing values) was also compared between the 5 PA21 dose groups by 
means of an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with dose group as fixed effect and baseline 
serum phosphorus levels as covariates. Pair-wise comparisons of the 4 higher-dose groups versus the 
lowest dose group were performed by means of the Dunnett procedure using the lowest dose group as 
the control group. PA21 dose groups were also compared pair-wise to the lowest PA21 dose group as a 
reference using a chi-squared test (2-sided, 5% significance level).  
The proportion of subjects with controlled serum phosphorus levels (i.e., ≥1.13 to ≤1.78 mmol/L) 
In the 5 PA21 groups was analyzed over time from baseline to week 9, for an increasing dose effect a 
2-sided Cochran-Armitage test at a 5% significance level was used.  Kaplan-Meier estimates were 
provided for the time to reach the first controlled serum phosphorus level. Log-rank tests were 
performed to pair-wise compare the different PA21 dose levels with the lowest dose level.  
Changes in the planned analysis: 
After finalisation of the SAP, dated 22 July 2009, the planned analyses were changed. 
After database lock: During the mapping of the raw and derived legacy datasets into Clinical Data 
Interchange Standards Consortium compliant datasets in 2012, inconsistencies between the original 
datasets and the final CSR, problems related to the programming and algorithm derivations due to lack 
of clarity, lack of documentation and insufficiently validated deliverables were discovered. These issues 
were considered to potentially impact the results of the final analysis that was described in the final 
PA-CL-03A CSR (15 June 2010). A list of the issues, and then the corrections to the analyses that have 
been affected by these issues are described below. The database was not re-opened and no data were 
altered during this re-analysis. 
Issues identified: 
•  Visit windows: No visit windows were pre-defined for any of the efficacy parameters, which led to 
problems in the identification of subjects in the FAS. These were defined and applied for the re-
analyses. 
•  Definition of the FAS was clarified. 
•  Compliance calculation: It was assumed that when the returned drug information was missing, all 
tablets were considered to have been taken which may overestimate compliance. A more 
conservative approach was applied for compliance calculation. 
•  Baseline clarification: For 1 subject the baseline was not correctly derived for the laboratory 
parameters, including the primary efficacy endpoint (serum phosphorus), as the value used for 
baseline was obtained after the treatment had started. 
• 
Time from CKD: The calculation of the time from the start of CKD was not computed in accordance 
with the SAP when partial dates were filled. 
•  Concomitant medication: A failure of the SAS programming algorithm for assigning the prior and 
concomitant medications flags was discovered, resulting in omitted concomitant medications. 
•  Adverse events: For 2 subjects, the algorithm failed to classify 2 AEs as treatment-emergent, 
whereas the start date of the events were after the treatment start date for these 2 subjects.

The design of the study is considered adequate. The open-label design can be considered acceptable 
given the difficulties in blinding especially related to discoloring of faeces because of the iron content. 
Further, the primary endpoint and most other endpoints as well are based on serum phosphorus levels 
measured at a central laboratory which is considered an objective measurement not easily prone to 
bias.  The statistical methods are considered adequate. Changes in planned analyses after database 
lock pertained to programming algorithms used. These are not considered to affect the study results as 
the database was not re-opened and no data were changed.  
Results of study PA-CL-03A 
Participant flow 
A schematic presentation is shown in Figure 2. Overall, 417 subjects were screened, 263 subjects were 
not eligible for the study and 154 subjects were randomised, all of which received study medication. 
The most common reason for screening failure was non-fulfillment of the inclusion criteria. 
Of the 154 randomised subjects, 103 subjects (66.9%) completed the study and 51 subjects (33.1%) 
were withdrawn from the study. The proportions of withdrawn subjects were highest in the PA21 10.0 
g/day and 12.5 g/day groups (44.4% and 37.5%, respectively), and lowest in the PA21 7.5 g/day 
group (20.0%). Reasons for withdrawal are shown in Table 2.

Table 2: Summary of primary reasons for study discontinuation (all subjects randomized) 
Withdrawal rates were high, between 20-45% overall. Most common reasons for withdrawal within the 
PA21 dose groups were low (high PA21 dose) or high (low PA21 dose) serum phosphorus levels related 
to the primary mechanism of action. These can be expected given the fixed dosing regimen, whereas 
doses are titrated in clinical practice. The single death was not related to treatment (see further 
section on Clinical Safety). 
Recruitment 
Subjects were randomized at 50 centres in 9 countries. The first subject first visit took place on 30 
January 2009, and the last subject last visit took place on 13 October 2009. The majority of the 
patients were randomised in Eastern Europe (126/154), a minority within the US (21/154).  
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was dated 7 August 2008 and there were 3 formal amendments to the study. One 
was implemented before the first study subject was randomized. The second amendment (17 March 
2009) included several clarifications and modifications to in- and exclusion criteria. The third 
amendment (10 June 2009) pertained to a reduction of the sample size. 
Baseline data 
The most important baseline characteristics of the FAS are shown in Table 3. In general, demographic 
baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. The majority of patients were male (about 
60%) and the mean age was around 60 years. The main primary cause of CKD was other followed by 
glomerulopathy. The median duration of ESRD was between 2 -3 yeas, whereas ranges were broad.  
In the FAS, 145 subjects (96.7%) had relevant medical and/or surgical history in addition to CKD. Most 
commonly recorded illnesses were hypertension and diabetes. The most commonly used prior and 
concomitant medications were calcium supplements, followed by “other anti-anaemic preparations” 
(ESA) and heparin products. Proportions of concomitant medications were largely similar across all 
treatment groups. Concomitant use of vitamin D and analogues was seen in 37 (29.4%) and 11 
(45.80%) patients on PA21 and sevelamer HCl, respectively. Parenteral iron preparations were used by 
62 (49.2%) of the subjects in the pooled PA21 group and by 9 (37.5%) of the sevelamer (HCl) group.

* Duration is the time since the first diagnosis of CKD.  
The majority of patients were male (about 60%) and the mean age was around 60 years. The main 
primary cause of CKD was other followed by glomerulopathy.  
Baseline characteristics are representative of the elderly CKD population on dialysis with significant co-
morbidity. Almost all patients used calcium-based phosphate binders due to the exclusion of sevelamer 
and lanthanum.

Major protocol deviations were identified for 34 (22.1%) of the 154 randomised subjects, varying 
between 19.2% in patients receiving 5.0 g/day PA21 and 30.8% in patients on 1.25 g/day PA21. The 
most common major protocol deviation was “non-compliance to study treatment”, occurring in 23 
subjects (14.9%) overall. The proportion of subjects who did not comply with treatment was highest in 
the PA21 10.0 g/day group (6 subjects, 22.2%). Overall, a total of 10 patients used prohibited 
medications and 7 patients had violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Treatment compliance was considered to be a compliance of 80% to 120%. Subjects generally 
complied well with their assigned treatment. Mean treatment compliance was 94.1% in the pooled 
PA21 group, ranging from 89.4% in the PA21 12.5 g/day group to 100.5% in the PA21 1.25 g/day 
group. In the sevelamer (HCl) group, mean treatment compliance was 92.0%. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Change from baseline to the end of treatment in serum phosphorus levels is summarised for the FAS 
and PPS in Table 5. Mean baseline serum phosphorus levels were comparable between treatment 
groups. Mean decreases from baseline to end of treatment were statistically significant for all PA21 
doses above 1.25 g/day and were broadly dose-dependent. The largest mean changes from baseline 
were seen in the two highest dose groups of PA21. In the sevelamer (HCl) group, mean change from 
baseline to end of treatment in serum phosphorus level was also statistically significant (p<0.001). 
Comparable results were obtained for the PPS.

For the FAS, PA21 doses of 10.0 g/day and 12.5 g/day showed a statistically significantly greater 
reduction from baseline in serum phosphorus when compared to the PA21 1.25 g/day group. Within 
the PPS all PA21 doses of 5.0 g/day and above showed a statistically significantly greater reduction 
from baseline in serum phosphorus when compared to the PA21 1.25 g/day group.  
When the study drug was stopped at Week 7 mean serum phosphorus levels returned towards baseline 
levels as subjects remaining in the study entered the 2-week run-out phase (FUP) (during which time

they did not receive treatment with a phosphate binder). This trend was noted earlier in the higher 
dose groups of hypophosphataemic subjects discontinuing treatment early (see Figure 3). 
Figure 3: Serum phosphorus levels at each time point in study PA-CL-03A (FAS). 
All doses of PA21 between 5.0 g/day and 12.5 g/day were effective in lowering serum phosphorus 
levels; mean change from baseline varied between 0.348 mmol/L (5.0 g/day) and 0.644 mmol/L (10.0 
g/day). The serum lowering effect was at least comparable to that of sevelamer (0.341 mmol/L). The 
effect appears dose-dependent, although interpretation is somewhat hampered by early withdrawal of 
patients in the highest dose groups.   
Part of the population did not have serum phosphorus levels > 1.78 mmol/L at baseline as patients 
could have been included based on serum phosphorus levels in the week before. According to the 
applicant, this reflects natural changes in phosphorus levels commonly seen in these patients.  This is 
further discussed below. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Controlled serum phosphorus levels 
At most time points from Week 2 onwards, the proportions of subjects with controlled serum 
phosphorus levels exceeded the proportions at baseline in all PA21 groups apart from the PA21 1.25 
g/day group. Highest proportions were seen in the PA21 12.5 g/day group.  
The proportions of subjects with controlled serum phosphorus levels (≥1.13 to ≤1.78 mmol/L) at week 
7/end of treatment and at any time during treatment is shown in Table 6 based on the FAS.

Time to reach first controlled serum phosphorus level 
In the FAS, median time to first controlled serum phosphorus level (≥1.13 to ≤1.78 mmol/L) was 
broadly dose-dependent in the PA21 groups, with the lowest dose group taking a longer time to 
achieve first controlled serum phosphorus compared to the higher dose groups: 36 days in the PA21 
1.25 g/day group, 14 days in the PA21 5.0 g/day group, 8 days in the PA21 7.5 g/day group, 14 days 
in the PA21 10.0 g/day group and 8 days in the PA21 12.5 g/day group. In the sevelamer (HCl) group 
median time to first controlled serum phosphorus level was 15 days.  
For all doses of PA21 except the lowest dose, the proportions of patients with controlled serum 
phosphorus levels was increased at the end of treatment compared to baseline, which is a clinically 
relevant finding. No clear dose-response relationship was seen. Proportions on target with PA21 were 
largely comparable to that obtained with sevelamer (about 45%). A relatively high percentage of 
patients were already on treatment target at baseline (between 12% and 25%), suggesting that part 
of the population had serum phosphorus levels just above the target range. Serum phosphorus levels 
are known to fluctuate as a result of changes in diet, although patients were kept on a stable phosphor 
diet within the study. Time to reach first controlled serum phosphorus level was between 8-14 days for 
PA21 doses between 5.0 g/day and 12.5 g/day and 15 days with sevelamer.     
The efficacy data support the use of PA21 5.0 g/day as starting dose, although based on a limited 
number of patients of which some had phosphorus levels close by the target level. In clinical practice, 
doses will be up titrated based on regular monitoring of serum phosphorus levels. 
Effects on serum total Ca, Ca X P and iPTH 
In the FAS, baseline mean serum calcium levels were comparable in the 6 treatment groups (2.10 to 
2.16 mmol/L). Mean changes from baseline in serum calcium at each time point were small and 
variable for all of the PA21 treatment groups, ranging from -0.08 to 0.14 mmol/L. In the sevelamer 
(HCl) group, mean changes from baseline were also small (0.02 to 0.12 mmol/L) over the study 
period. 
In the FAS, the baseline mean serum calcium × phosphorus products were comparable in the 6 
treatment groups (between 4.44 to 4.79 mmol2/L2). Mean decreases in serum calcium × phosphorus 
product from baseline to the last value during treatment ranged from -0.19 mmol2/L2 in the PA21 12.5 
g/day group, to -1.38 mmol2/L2 in the 10.0 g/day group. The comparable value for the sevelamer 
(HCl) group was -0.78 mmol2/L2. These changes were statistically significant for all groups except the 
PA21 1.25 g/day group. 
In the FAS, mean serum iPTH levels at baseline ranged from 222.38 ng/L in the PA21 12.5 g/day 
group to 271.60 ng/L in the PA21 7.5 g/day group. The mean serum iPTH levels were variable over 
time and across the treatment groups. Mean decreases from baseline in serum iPTH levels varied 
between 0.08 ng/L (PA21 7.5 g/day) and 60.65 ng/L (PA21 12.5 g/day) at end of treatment with PA21. 
The comparable value for sevelamer was -38.80 ng/L.  
Serum calcium levels remained rather stable whereas decreases in serum calcium x phosphorus 
product were consistent with the decreases seen in serum phosphorus levels. Mean serum iPTH levels

were variable and tended to decrease especially in the highest dose group of PA21 and also for 
sevelamer. 
2.2.7.  Main studies 
This application is based on one phase 3 confirmatory trial to demonstrate efficacy and safety of PA21 
in patients with CKD.  
Study PA-CL-05A: An Open-label, Randomised, Active-controlled, Parallel Group, Multicentre, Phase 3 
Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of PA21 Compared with Sevelamer Carbonate Followed by 
a Randomised Comparison of PA21 Maintenance Dose Versus PA21 Low Dose in Dialysis Patients with 
Hyperphosphataemia. 
Methods 
• 
Adult (≥18 years) patients receiving maintenance HD 3 times/week with a Kt/V of ≥1.2 or peritoneal 
Study participants  
dialysis (PD) with a Kt/V of ≥1.7 ≥3 months, receiving stable doses of phosphate binder (1 or 2 
allowed) for at least 1 month before screening were eligible for this study after having provided signed 
and dated informed consent. Only patients with serum phosphorus levels >1.94 mmol/L during the 
washout phase (minimum of 2 weeks washout was obligatory) were eligible for randomization. 
Main exclusion criteria included serum calcium below 1.9 mmol/L, hypercalcaemia (serum total calcium 
>2.60 mmol/L) in subjects on non-calcium based phosphate binders, iPTH levels >800 ng/L at 
screening. Subjects with iPTH >600 ng/L at screening must be considered stable whereas patients with 
planned or expected parathyroidectomy within the next 12 months were excluded. 
Further exclusion criteria were serum ferritin >2,000 µg/L, history of haemochromatosis, or history of 
other iron storage disorders, history of major gastrointestinal surgery or significant GI or hepatic 
disorders  in the past 3 years, active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3 times the upper limit of the normal range at screening, known 
seropositivity to human immunodeficiency virus, serious medical conditions or planned major surgery 
that would interfere with the study, unstable angina, unstable hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, 
pregnancy, lactation or lack of effective contraception. 
Subjects on PD with a history of peritonitis in the last 3 months or ≥3 episodes in the last 12 months 
were excluded. Use of antacids containing aluminium or magnesium and use of oral iron preparations 
within 1 month before screening was not allowed.  
Inclusion criteria stage 2: Subjects entering Stage 2 must be on HD, must complete Stage 1, must be 
on PA21 in Stage 1, and must have a controlled serum phosphorus level of <1.78 mmol/L at Week 20. 
Inclusion criteria were representative for the target population in need of phosphate binder treatment 
and in line with current KDOQI treatment guidelines.  In- and exclusion criteria largely resembles that 
of the dose-finding study. Most important differences were the higher cut-off value for serum 
phosphorus level before inclusion (≥ 1.94 mmol/L), patients on PD were allowed, all patients should 
have been on prior phosphate binder therapy including sevelamer, and parenteral iron infusions were 
allowed during the study. 
Again, patients with significant GI and liver co-morbidity or iron storage disorders were excluded from 
the trial. Further, patients with a history of peritonitis were excluded.

• 
The study is a 2-stage re-randomization study (see  
Treatments  
Figure 4).  
Figure 4: Schematic design of study PA-CL-05A 
Stage 1: 
Subjects who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria completed a washout from their previous 
phosphate binders for at least 2 weeks and a maximum of 4 weeks. Eligible subjects were randomised 
via IVRS in a 2:1 ratio to either PA21 or sevelamer, respectively, and entered the treatment period. 
During the titration period of 8 weeks, dose changes were allowed every 2 weeks. Dose changes 
indicated by the Week 8 blood sample were the final changes for the titration period. For analysis 
purposes, the Stage 1 titration period was defined as the baseline visit (Day 1) to Week 12 (Day 85). 
After the final dose titration, the subjects continued on a stable dose of either PA21 or sevelamer until 
the Week 12 assessment. Dose titrations for tolerability reasons throughout this 4-week period were 
allowed, however. The Stage 1 maintenance period was defined as the Week 12 visit (Day 85) to 
Week 24 visit (Day 169) for analysis purposes. During this period dose modifications were allowed for 
both tolerability and efficacy reasons (every 4 weeks).  
PA21: PA21 chewable tablets containing 2.5 g PA21 and 500 mg iron. 
The starting dose was 5.0 g/day, which was also the minimum dose. The maximum dose of PA21 was 
15.0 g/day (6 tablets/day). Dosing frequency was three times daily except for the lowest dose of 5.0 
g/day which was administered twice daily with meals.  
Sevelamer: The active control was sevelamer carbonate, Renvela tablets containing 800 mg of 
sevelamer carbonate.  
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 55/112 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The starting dose was 4.8 g/day. The maximum dose of sevelamer was 14.4 g/day (18 tablets/day) 
and the minimum dose was 2.4 g/day (3 tablets/day). Dosing frequency was three times daily with 
meals. 
Stage 2: 
In Stage 2, the first 100 subjects on HD (no PD allowed) who completed Stage 1 PA21 treatment 
group, and who had a controlled serum phosphorus level of <1.78 mmol/L at Week 20, were 
randomised via IVRS in a 1:1 ratio to the PA21 maintenance dose (MD) group or the PA21 low dose 
(LD) group for the next 3 weeks. No dose adjustments were allowed until Stage 2 was complete.  
PA21 maintenance dose (MD): PA21 chewable tablets containing 2.5 g PA21 and 500 mg iron. 
Patients continued with the same dose they had been receiving at the end of Stage 1 (Week 24).  
PA21 low dose (LD): PA21 chewable tablets containing 1.25 g PA21 and 250 mg iron.  
Patients were switched to a dose of 1.25 g/day, one tablet to be taken with the largest meal.  
The design of the study including an active controlled treatment phase and a re-randomised 
withdrawal phase allows assessment of both efficacy in relation to current treatment and maintenance 
of effect or tolerability. Treatment duration is considered sufficient and dose of PA21 is supported by 
the dose-finding study. The exact reason for the maximum dose of PA21 of 15.0 g/day is not clear, but 
most likely based on the safety profile.  The dose of sevelamer carbonate is in line with the highest 
recommended starting dose within the SPC (for serum phosphorus levels >2.42 mmol/L), which is 
acceptable.  
Within the withdrawal phase, a PA21 low dose was used which appeared ineffective based on the 
phase 2 study. A real placebo could have been chosen to avoid discussions on potential efficacy of this 
dose, albeit limited.    
Objectives 
• 
Primary objective 
• 
To establish the superiority of PA21 maintenance dose (MD) versus PA21 low dose (LD) control in 
maintaining the phosphorus lowering effect in patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD), by 
comparing the change in serum phosphorus levels during a 3-week period (Stage 2) that follows 
24 weeks of PA21 treatment.  
• 
To assess the long-term safety and tolerability of PA21 in patients on dialysis. 
Secondary objectives  
• 
Establish the non-inferiority of PA21 versus sevelamer carbonate (sevelamer) in lowering serum 
phosphorus in patients on dialysis after 12 weeks of treatment. 
•  Assess quality of life. 
•  Compare safety and tolerability of PA21 versus sevelamer. 
• 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Week 24 in serum phosphorus levels at Week 27, a 
superiority comparison between the PA21 MD group and the PA21 LD control group (fixed dose of 1.25 
g/day) in the primary efficacy set (PES) (Stage 2).  
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 56/112 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
The main secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in serum phosphorus levels at Week 12 – 
a non-inferiority comparison between PA21 and sevelamer (per-protocol set (PPS) and full analysis set 
(FAS) Stage 1). If non-inferiority was shown, superiority testing was performed. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints related to serum phosphorus level included: 
• 
Proportion of subjects achieving serum phosphorus control (Stage 1) based on: 
o  within the KDOQI guideline target range of 1.13 to 1.78 mmol/L at a given time point  
o  within the KDIGO normal range of 0.81 to 1.45 mmol/L at a given time point 
•  Duration of serum phosphorus control based on KDIGO normal or KDOQI guideline target range. 
• 
The time for the phosphorus level to fall within KDIGO normal or KDOQI target range (Stage 1) or 
to rise without these ranges (Stage 2). 
•  Serum total calcium levels, serum calcium x phosphorus product and serum iPTH levels. 
Other assessments included the assessment of pill burden, quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire), patient 
preference and patient satisfaction, changes in dietary habits, and changes in dialysis parameters. 
Safety endpoints: 
The primary safety assessments were the incidence of AEs and routine haematological and biochemical 
(including liver function) laboratory tests. Adverse events that began or that worsened in severity after 
at least 1 dose of study treatment had been administered were considered treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAE). Specific secondary safety endpoints included the proportion of subjects that 
developed hypo/hyperphosphataemia (<0.81 mmol/L / >2.75 mmol/L); hypo/hypercalcaemia 
(<1.9 mmol/L / >2.75 mmol/L) and hyperparathyroidism (iPTH value >600 ng/L). Other safety 
measurements were physical examination parameters, vital signs, standard 12-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG) parameters, vitamin status (A, D, E, and K), iron status (iron, ferritin, transferrin and transferrin 
saturation), serum calcium and iPTH levels, biochemical markers of bone resorption and formation 
(carboxyterminal cross-linking telopeptide of bone collagen, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, 
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23). 
Overall, the endpoints are considered adequate and commonly used within clinical trials with 
phosphate binders. The primary endpoint assessed within the withdrawal phase mainly provides 
information on the maintenance of effect/absence of tolerability with PA21 in a selected population of 
responders. The main secondary endpoint is considered of equal importance as it provides information 
on the absolute effect size in the target population and efficacy relative to currently available 
treatment. In this respect, the proportion of responders according to the KDOQI target range reflects 
clinical treatment practice and is considered an important clinically relevant endpoint. Proportion of 
patients reaching phosphorus levels within the normal range are less relevant and not discussed 
separately discussed within this assessment report. 
• 
Stage 2 (Primary Efficacy Analyses) 
Sample size 
The sample size for Stage 2 of the study was based on the primary efficacy endpoint. The number of 
subjects needed for this analysis was 50 per group, assuming a difference between the groups of 0.42 
mmol/L, an SD of 0.63 mmol/L, a power of 90% and a 2-sided significance value of 0.05. Therefore, it 
was planned to randomise a total of 100 subjects for Stage 2 of the study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 57/112 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Stage 1 (Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses) 
The sample size for Stage 1 of the study was based on the non-inferiority comparison between PA21 
and sevelamer at week 12. Assuming a mean decrease in serum phosphorus levels of 0.65 mmol/L in 
both treatment groups with an SD of 0.63 mmol/L, a power of 90%, a non-inferiority margin of 0.19 
mmol/L, and a randomisation ratio of 2:1 (PA21:sevelamer), a total of 507 per-protocol subjects were 
required (338 subjects in the PA21 group and 169 subjects in the sevelamer group). Assuming a 20% 
rate of subjects not being in the PPS, and to ensure that a sufficient number of subjects were exposed 
to PA21 after 6 months of treatment for the safety evaluation, enrolment was planned up to a 
maximum of 940 subjects. This resulted in an increase power to at least 95% for demonstrating non-
inferiority of PA21 against sevelamer, under similar assumptions.  
It was anticipated that approximately 100 subjects on PD would be recruited and randomised in a 2:1 
ratio to PA21 or sevelamer (67 in the PA21 treatment group and 33 in the sevelamer group). 
• 
At Stage 1, the randomisation ratio was 2:1 for PA21:sevelamer, and the randomisation were stratified 
Randomisation 
by HD/PD status and country. At Stage 2, eligible subjects were randomised 1:1 to either PA21 MD or 
PA21 LD. Subjects were assigned to their treatment group by central randomisation via IVRS. 
• 
An open-label design was employed because of the impracticability of maintaining blinding of the study 
Blinding 
treatment. In addition, obtaining and/or manufacturing placebos to sevelamer and PA21 are 
impractical and/or technically challenging. Sevelamer tablets must be swallowed whole, while PA21 is 
administered as a chewable tablet and, therefore, a double dummy procedure in Stage 1 would require 
subjects to take an unreasonably high number of tablets. A placebo would have led to immediate 
unblinding in Stage 1 and Stage 2 due to differences in the stool colour of subjects taking PA21. 
Moreover, the open-label design did not bias the primary efficacy endpoint of serum phosphorus, which 
is an objective laboratory measurement analysed by 1 of 2 central laboratories. 
• 
The final SAP dated 1 June 2012. 
Statistical methods 
Populations analysed 
The safety set (SS) included all randomised subjects who took at least 1 dose of study medication. 
The Full analysis population (FAS) included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
study medication and had at least 1 post-baseline evaluable efficacy assessment. 
The Per-protocol set (PPS) included all subjects in the FAS who completed the dose titration period and 
had ≥1 evaluable serum phosphorus result ≥ Week 12, without major protocol deviations. 
The safety set 2 (SS2) included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication in Stage 
2. 
The primary efficacy set (PES) included all subjects randomised to Stage 2 who received ≥ 1 dose of 
study medication during Stage 2 and had ≥ 1 evaluable post-baseline efficacy assessment in Stage 2. 
The primary efficacy per-protocol set (PEPPS) included all patients in the PES without major protocol 
deviations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 58/112 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Major protocol violations included serum phosphorus <1.94 mmol/L prior to randomisation, 
concomitant phosphate binder use, compliance with study medication <70% or >120%, subject not 
taking treatment to which they were randomized, and use of prohibited medications.  
Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the change in serum phosphorus levels from Week 24 to Week 
27 between the PA21 MD and LD control group. This analysis was conducted using an ANCOVA with 
the LOCF approach for missing data imputation, and baseline (Week 24) serum phosphorus level and 
region (US/EU/ROW) as covariates for the PES. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the primary 
ANCOVA model on the observed cases (OC) and the mixed model for repeated measures missing at 
random (MMRM-MAR) model. This method relies on less stringent assumptions than the LOCF method. 
The main primary efficacy analysis was repeated on the PEPPS. 
Main secondary analysis: 
The non-inferiority analysis to compare the change from baseline in serum phosphorus levels at Week 
12 in the PA21 group to the sevelamer group on the PPS, was performed using ANCOVA-LOCF 
analysis. Treatment, baseline serum phosphorus level, dialysis status and region (US, EU, ROW) were 
treated as fixed effects in the model. If the upper bound of the 97.5% 1-sided CI fell below 0.19 
mmol/L, then the non-inferiority of PA21 against sevelamer was concluded. If non-inferiority was 
achieved, testing of the superiority of PA21 against sevelamer group was planned using a similar 
model. The analysis was repeated on the FAS. 
Non-inferiority margin: The non-inferiority margin was based on the absolute change in serum 
phosphorus from baseline reported for sevelamer in published clinical trials, which was about 0.64 
mmol/L. Given the consistency of the published results, the choice of a margin of 0.19 mmol/L appears 
to be reasonable as it is approximately a third of the lower bound of the 95% CI of the absolute 
change in serum phosphorus seen with sevelamer (about 0.47 mmol/L). The concern that the non-
inferiority margin chosen will not be able to demonstrate that the effect size seen with PA21 will be 
significantly greater than zero (or placebo) should be allayed by the demonstration of superiority of the 
PA21 MD group versus the non-effective LD control group which essentially functions as a placebo 
control group. 
Other secondary analyses: 
The percentage of subjects who achieved control at Week 12 and Week 24 was summarised for the 
FAS. Similar analyses were included for subjects in Stage 2 at Weeks 24, 25, 26 and 27 for the PES. 
Logistic models were used to derive the odds ratios using treatment and baseline serum phosphorus 
value as covariates for the FAS and PES.  
At Stage 1, the time for the serum phosphorus level to fall within the KDIGO normal or KDOQI target 
range was analysed using Kaplan-Meier on the FAS and the comparison between the 2 treatment 
groups was assessed using the log-rank test.  
All efficacy analyses of laboratory values were based on results from the central laboratories. 
In addition to the overall analyses sets, efficacy endpoints were also evaluated for subgroups based on 
dialysis status (PD, HD), region (EU, US, ROW), age (≤65, >65), sex, race (White, Black, Other), 
ethnicity (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic), and prior sevelamer treatment within 12 months prior to screening. 
Quality of life was assessed using the standard SF-36 (Version 2.0) quality of life questionnaire. The 
SF-36 scale was analysed using the standard algorithms for Version 2.0. A traditional Likert scale was 
used for the patient preference and patient satisfaction assessments. 
Safety analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 59/112 
 
  
  
The primary safety assessments were the AE profile and significant changes in routine 
biochemical/haematological laboratory tests. All AE summaries were done for all of the subjects in a 
treatment group combined and by the maximum dose received during the trial. In addition, AEs were 
evaluated for subgroups or subjects on HD and PD. Laboratory values, vital signs, physical 
examinations results, and ECG parameters were also summarised by treatment group using descriptive 
statistics and/or shift tables. 
Modifications to the SAP: 
There were few modifications to the statistical analyses as outlined in the final protocol. The main 
changes concerned inclusion of the PES, PEPPS, and SS2 analysis sets to define the appropriate 
subject groups for the primary efficacy analysis and safety and tolerability assessments for Stage 2, 
comparing PA21 MD and PA21 LD.  
A Post-hoc Analysis Plan (Final Version 1.0, 7 October 2012) was developed for additional exploratory 
analyses following the review of the initial results. These included amongst others summaries of TEAEs 
by maximum dose during the titration and maintenance periods, adjusted using the number of 
subjects present at the beginning of the period, treatment-related TEAEs leading to withdrawal, overall 
and by maximum dose separately for stage 1 and 2, and the duration and outcome of diarrhoea events 
in the various stages. 
Commonly applied statistical methods were used. The clinical relevance of the proposed non-inferiority 
margin was not discussed, and non-inferiority needs to be supported by the totality of data. A 
definition of a non-inferiority margin for the proportion of patients on target levels would have been 
helpful to interpret the clinical relevance of the results based on serum phosphorus levels only.  
LOCF method was used for missing data for the analyses based on serum phosphorus levels in stage 1 
and stage 2. This is considered a partial conservative approach. Performed sensitivity analyses are less 
conservative. Responders were only analyzed based on observed cases only. A sensitivity analysis was 
performed as well. 
No major changes were made to the SAP after study completion. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Overall, 1,840 subjects were screened, 781 subjects were not eligible for the study and 1,059 subjects 
were randomized. The most common reason for screening failure for stage 1 were serum phosphate 
levels that did not meet the entry criteria (34.3% of patients screened), other entry criteria not met 
(39.1%), subject withdrew consent (6.4%) and Investigator decision (1.8%).  
Subject disposition and reasons for withdrawal are presented in Figure 5 and Table 7, respectively.   
Stage 1 
Of the 1,059 subjects randomised, 1,055 (99.6%) were treated, and 808 (76.3% overall; 72.5% of 
PA21-treated subjects and 84% of sevelamer-treated subjects) completed Stage 1. During Stage 1, 
251 subjects (23.7%) prematurely discontinued the study: 195 subjects (27.5%) treated with PA21 
and 56 (16.0%) treated with sevelamer. 
The most common reasons for withdrawal in Stage 1 were non-fatal AEs other than phosphorus or 
calcium level related events (48.2% in PA21 group and 37.5% in sevelamer group of all withdrawals). 
Next commonly reported reasons were withdrawal of consent, renal transplant, hyperphosphataemia, 
and death (not reported to treatment, see further safety assessment). Investigator decision was 
related to non-compliance. The sponsor decision was due to closure of one site (701).

Stage 2 
A total of 99 subjects on HD enrolled in Stage 2. Eight subjects were withdrawn from the PA21 MD 
dose due to protocol deviations; 5 subjects because they were dispensed PA-CL-05B drug in error and 
three because of non-compliance. Withdrawal rates with PA21 LD were low.

Recruitment 
Subjects were screened at 174 centres and randomized at 161 centres in the US, EU and ROW. The 
first subject first visit took place on 9 March 2011, and the last subject last visit took place on 9 April 
2012.  The majority of the patients were randomised in the US (516/1,059), followed by the ROW 
region (307/1,059 of which 151 in Russia) and the EU (236/1,059 of which 62 in Czech Republic). 
In Stage 2, there was a single randomisation error by the site and only 99 subjects were actually 
enrolled in Stage 2. In the Stage 2 PES, 70 subjects (75.3%) came from the US, 15 (16.1%) from the 
EU, and 8 (8.6%) from the ROW region. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 3 formal amendments to the study protocol of which two were implemented prior to 
screening and enrolment of subjects. These included several clarifications to the wording in the 
protocol/eCRF (first amendment) and clarifications related to inclusion criteria, study visits, collection 
of safety data and a DSBM was added. Amendment 3, implemented during the conduct of Stage 1, 
introduced the following changes that impacted the conduct of the study: new upper limit of serum 
ferritin (>2,000 µg/L), increased sample size as the loss of evaluable subjects between randomized set 
and PPS was underestimated, calcium-based antacids were prohibited, frequency of Kt/V calculation 
was changed and parameters corrected for the Kt/V calculation.  
About 1.5-2 times more patients on PA21 compared to sevelamer were withdrawn during the first 
stage of the study (27.5% versus 16.0%). Most common reasons were adverse events and withdrawal 
of consent in both groups. Based on the randomised population, 13.2% (94/710) of patients 
randomised on PA21 withdrew due to AEs other than phosphorus or calcium levels related events 
compared to 5.7% (20/349) of patients randomised to sevelamer, which is 2-3 times higher. 
Withdrawals due to fatalities and AEs, including hyperphosphataemia, are further discussed in the 
safety assessment. 
Discontinuations rates were in general low during the withdrawal phase. 
Baseline data 
Stage 1 
Within the FAS, 504 subjects (48.4%) came from the US, 232 (22.3%) from the EU and 305 (29.3%) 
from the ROW region. The mean age of subjects was 56.1 years, the majority were male (57.8%) and 
white (76.8%). The majority of patients were on HD (91.8%) (Table 8).  
The Stage 1 treatment groups were generally comparable with minor differences between PA21 and 
sevelamer treatments groups. There was, however, an imbalance in the sex groups with a greater 
proportion of female subjects in the PA21 group (44.8%) than in the sevelamer group (36.9%). 
Descriptive summary statistics for demographic characteristics in the PPS and SS were similar to the 
FAS.

The most common reasons for ESRD were diabetes mellitus, hypertension and glomerulonephritis. 
There were no notable differences between treatment groups relative to reason for ESRD, time to start 
of ESRD or first dialysis, baseline Kt/V value, or prior phosphate binder treatment. Also, no significant 
differences in subjects’ ESRD were observed in the PES and SS relative to the FAS (Table 9). A total of 
8% of patients had a previous renal transplant ant 4.5% had a previous parathyroidectomy. 
Most commonly used phosphate binders were calcium-based. About 38% of patients had ever used 
sevelamer in the year prior to screening.  
Stage 2 
Within the PES, 70 subjects (75.3%) came from the US, 15 (16.1%) from the EU and 8 (8.6%) from 
the ROW region. In Stage 2 compared with Stage 1 there were more Black/African American subjects 
and more Hispanic subjects, related to the large proportion of subjects from the US enrolled in Stage 
2. 
There were no notable demographic or disease related differences between the PA21 MD and PA21 LD 
treatment groups. Similar results were obtained in the PEPPS and SS2. 
Concomitant medication in Stage 1 and 2: Subjects had a broad range of disease histories and 
concomitant medication use typical for the patient population. Treatment groups were generally 
balanced. Within Stage 2, more subjects started concomitant medications in the LD group compared 
with the MD group (65.3% versus 15.6%), especially drugs used to treat hyperphosphataemia (e.g. 
anti-anaemic preparations and anti-parathyroid preparations). In Stage 1, more than 70% of subjects 
in both treatment groups were taking concomitant iron products; 70.6% in patients on PA21 and 
74.1% in patients on sevelamer. Concomitant intravenous iron products were received by 66.3% of 
subjects on HD and 28.7% on PD.  
A higher proportion of subjects in the PA21 LD required the addition of concomitant iron products or an 
increase in dose compared with subjects in the MD group (16.3% versus 2.2%, respectively).

At start of the study, the mean age of subjects was 56.1 years, the majority were male (57.8%) and 
white (76.8%). The most common reasons for CKD were glomerulonephritis, diabetes and 
pyelonephritis. Baseline and disease related characteristics were in general comparable. A somewhat 
higher rate of males in the sevelamer group is noted.  About one third of the patients had used 
sevelamer before start of the study. The proportion of patients on PD (8%) is limited, but in line with 
what can be expected based on the assumed distribution in the overall ESRD population (about 10%). 
Treatment groups within the withdrawal phase were also in general comparable. Further, there 
appeared to be no important differences in baseline characteristics between patients entering the 
withdrawal phase compared to the overall population.  
Compliance with study medication: The proportion of subjects compliant at 70 to 120% expected in 
Stage 1 was 82.6% for the PA21 group versus 77.2% for the sevelamer group (FAS). Low compliance 
(<70% expected) was more common in the sevelamer group compared with the PA21 group (21.3% 
versus 15.1%, respectively). Compliance levels with PA21 treatment were generally lower in Stage 2 
for subjects in both the MD and LD groups than in Stage 1. The proportion of subjects who were 
compliant at 70 to 120% was 68.2% in the PA21 MD and 55.1% in the LD group (PES). The PA21 LD 
group reported more patients with compliance rate >120% (18.4% vs. 2.3%). Non-compliance issues 
were most often related to improper recording of treatment rather than subjects actually not taking 
the amount of study medication as prescribed.

Major protocol violations: Within Stage 1, 361 (34.1%) patients had at least one major protocol 
deviation (33.7% of PA21 and 35.0% of sevelamer treated patients). The most common major 
protocol deviations in Stage 1 were non-compliance (17.9% with PA21 and 22.6% with sevelamer), 
treatment duration <11 weeks (15.8% with PA21 and 8.0% for sevelamer), and prohibited use of 
phosphate binders before treatment or during titration (2.0% for PA21 and 2.9% for sevelamer). 
In Stage 2, major protocol deviations were identified for 41 subjects (41.4%) of the randomised 
subjects (38.0% in PA21 MD and 44.9% in PA21 LD). The most common major protocol deviation was 
non-compliance with study medication (22.0% for PA21 HD and 34.7% for PA21 LD). Non-compliance 
issues were most often related to improper recording of treatment rather than subjects actually not 
taking the amount of study medication as prescribed.  
Patients were mainly excluded from the per-protocol analysis sets due to non-compliance. Compliance 
rates are in general comparable to that known for patients with ESRD, although the applicant states 
that in part these rates can be explained by improper recording. Results are presented for different 
analysis populations and consistency between results is of importance. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Stage 2 - Primary efficacy endpoint 
In the PES and PEPPS sets, mean serum phosphorus levels were maintained during Stage 2 in subjects 
that continued on their PA21 MD, while subjects in the PA21 LD showed marked increases as early as 
Week 25, one week after transitioning to the LD control (see  
Figure 6 and Table 11). The primary efficacy analysis confirmed that the PA21 MD was superior to the 
PA21 LD. Results in the PEPPS were comparable to those in the PES. Sensitivity analyses based on 
observed cases only or the MMRM-RAM model resulted in similar results (mean difference PA21 LD vs 
MD: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.68; PES).

Within the withdrawal phase, superiority of the PA21 MD over PA21 LD was demonstrated. However, 
the mean serum phosphorus level on PA21 LD did not return to baseline levels prior to start of 
treatment. The applicant is requested to explain this observation and any impact on the interpretation 
of the data. 
The mean PA21 dose in the MD group in Stage 2 was 7.4 g/day (range: 1.4 – 14.8 g/day) versus 1.3 
g/day (range: 0.2 – 5.0 g/day) in the LD group (SS2). Subjects in the PA21 MD group were treated for 
a mean of 22.9 days (range: 15 – 43 days); subjects in the LD group were treated for a mean of 21.2 
days (range: 9 – 33 days).

Stage 2 - Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Proportions with controlled serum phosphorus levels 
At stage 2 baseline (week 24), 72.7% of subjects in the MD group and 61.2% in the LD group were 
within the KDOQI target range (1.13 to 1.78 mmol/L). At week 27, 63.2% of patients in the MD were 
within the target rage, versus only 15.2% in the LD group, confirming the efficacy of the MD.  
Maintenance of effect was shown for PA21 MD based on proportions of patients remaining on target 
whereas the proportion of patients on target significantly decreased with PA21 LD. These results 
support the primary efficacy analysis.  
Not all patients had controlled serum phosphorus level < 1.78 mmol/L at baseline (week 24) as the 
inclusion for stage 2 was based on week 20. It is acceptable that proportions may change due to f the 
normal day-to-day fluctuations of serum phosphorus levels. However, percentages on target dropped 
with 30-40% in 4 weeks whereas patients were to be kept on a stable phosphorus diet. The applicant 
is requested to provide additional justification that all patients were indeed responders and no 
noticeable differences were observed between treatment groups.  
The population included in Stage 2 is by definition a selected population as only responders were 
included. This can be accepted as Stage 1 will provide information on the absolute efficacy of PA21.  
Effects on serum total Ca, Ca X P and iPTH 
No changes over time in serum total calcium levels were observed in the PES. The calcium-phosphorus 
product was statistically significantly higher in the PA21 MD group compared with the LD group 
(p<0.001). The iPTH levels increased in PA21 LD, although not statistically significant from PA21 MD.  
The increases seen in serum calcium x phosphorus product and iPTH with the PA21 LD group reflect 
the changes in serum phosphorus levels.  
Stage 1 – Secondary analyses comparing PA21 with sevelamer 
The mean serum phosphorus level and mean change from baseline through week 24 are shown in 
Figure 7. The decrease in serum phosphorus from baseline to Week 12 was maintained through Week 
24 for both treatment groups, demonstrating maintenance of efficacy. Serum phosphorus levels at 
Week 24 were on average 1.8 mmol/L (SD: 0.51) and 1.7 mmol/L (SD: 0.45) for PA21 and sevelamer, 
respectively (LOCF, FAS). Corresponding data for the PPS (LOCF) were 1.8 mmol/L (SD: 0.50) and 1.6 
mmol/L (SD: 0.43) for PA21 and sevelamer, respectively.

Key secondary efficacy analysis: Non-inferiority of PA21 v sevelamer 
In Stage 1, the non-inferiority of PA21 versus sevelamer was demonstrated for efficacy in lowering 
serum phosphorus in ESRD patients (on HD or PD) after 12 weeks of treatment. The mean decrease 
from baseline to the Week 12 Endpoint (LOCF) was -0.7 mmol/L in the PA21 group compared to -0.8 
mmol/L in the sevelamer group (PPS) (see Table 12). The least square mean estimate of the difference 
was 0.08 mmol/L with the upper bound of the 97.5% CI equal to 0.15 mmol/L, thus establishing non-
inferiority based on a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 0.19 mmol/L. Similar results were obtained 
for the FAS (N=1,041; mean difference: 0.10, 97.5% CI upper limit: 0.16).  
Superiority analysis of PA21 against sevelamer indicated a significant difference in the change from 
baseline which was greater with sevelamer than PA21 (p=0.011). The corresponding point estimates 
for the difference between PA21 and sevelamer were 0.08 mmol/L (PPS) or 0.10 mmol/L (FAS).  
Table 12: Week 12 non-inferiority analysis of PA21 vs sevelamer for efficacy in lowering 
serum phosphorus in stage 1 of study PA-CL-05A (PPS). 
Non-inferiority between PA21 and sevelamer was demonstrated at week 12 based on serum 
phosphorus levels and the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.19 mmol/L. Within the FAS the mean 
difference was 0.10 mmol/L (97.5% CI upper limit: 0.16 mmol/L) and comparable results were 
obtained based on the PPS. Subsequently performed superiority analyses showed that in fact the 
change from baseline was statistically significantly higher with sevelamer. Although this difference is 
small and does not appear to be clinically relevant, the proportion of patients reaching target is 
considered an important parameter to assess clinical relevance of the effect. These analyses do raise 
concern on the non-inferiority of PA21 compared to sevelamer and are further discussed below. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed for missing data. The number of patients with data is presented in 
the Table below.

Covariates besides treatment in the models were: baseline, dialysis status, region (in the MMRM-MAR also week and 
treatment*week); # using besides covariates, only baseline and week 12 data 
## using besides covariates, data of all weeks from between baseline to week 12; non-inferiority margin is 0.19 
(mmol/L). 
The LOCF method was used for imputation of missing data. In the FAS, non-missing data from week 1 
up to (not including) week 12 varied from 3.5% to 15.6% and from 3.5% to 13.0% in the PA21 and 
Sevelamer group respectively in stage 1. For the PPS, this was from 1.7% to 17.3% and from 0.4% to 
10.3% respectively (the PPS by definition had fewer missing data). Therefore, the amout of missing 
data is reasonably comparable between groups, also at individual time points, but is not negligible. The 
reason for missings of data should be provided at different times to clarify whether these occurred 
randomly or could be related to efficacy. The applicant should further present the number of 
withdrawals at week 12 in both treatment groups and clarify whether these were handled as missings 
in the analyses.

Sensitivity analyses were performed with regard to missing values. The MAR model gives more or less 
the treatment effect if all patients had continued on treatment for the whole study duration. More 
precisely that given the covariates baseline dialysis status, region, week, the estimate for non-missing 
patients are unbiased estimate for all patients with that same covariates. The OC analysis is in essence 
a subset analysis, namely treatment effect in subset of patients that received  treatment at baseline 
and week 12. The LOCF analysis gives the treatment effect in the scenario that after missing, patients 
do not further improve (nor worsen). This is partly conservative. This is because of the decreasing 
trend in both treatments, so that at a missing time point, LOCF for a patient will impute  his/her worse 
condition of before. However, LOCF is influenced by differences in the percentage of missing data 
between groups and differences in timing of missing data within groups. E.g. if in the PA21 arm all 
patients are on treatment till week 8 and reach the target level, but are missing from week 8 onwards, 
then the LOCF estimate for PA21 will be the target level. However in reality, it is more sensible that 
patients off treatment will gradually return to baseline. Since in the PA21 arm there were more 
withdrawals this could be a critical issue. Therefore,  additional sensitivity analyses are proposed. 
The MAA performed and additional analysis based on KDOQI criterion, considering subjects having 
favoring P-lowering effect:  
(1) patients were excluded from the FAS analysis (called Modified FAS, that construed 34% and 29% 
of Overall FAS population in PA21 and Sevelamer groups, respectively) if they were taking any 
prohibited medications (other P binders, oral iron, Ca and Mg compounds) or with overall compliance 
>120%, or with incomplete Kt/V assessments) and  
(2) once subject did change dose it was treated as non-responder.  
The proportion of responders were lower in Modified FAS as compared to Overall FAS populations 
(45.3% vs 36.5% in PA21 and 54.9 vs 45.6% in SEV groups at Week 12, i.e. ~9% lower; 53.1% vs 
41.1% in PA21 and 53.6 vs 45.2% in SEV groups at Week 24, i.e. ~8 to 12% lower; and 51.9% vs 
34.3% in PA21 and 55.2 vs 34.5% in SEV groups at Week 52, i.e. ~17 to 21% lower in Modified FAS 
population. The number of analyzed at 3 time points are comparably lower then it was at baseline. 
Reaching only 20-30 % of the size that was at the baseline. 
Further to this, MAA made odds ratios of responder rates PA21 vs SEV analysis using logistic 
regression model, adjusting for baseline serum P. At all three time points (Week 12, 24 and 52) the 
95% CI for odds ratios included 1, indicating no statistical significant differences between PA21 and 
SEV groups. These analyses are reassuring that no differences are reasonable to expect.         
Other secondary endpoints 
Serum phosphorus levels over time 
In the FAS, the mean serum phosphorus level had dropped below 1.78 mmol/L (within the KDOQI 
target range) by Week 6 in the sevelamer group and by Week 16 in the PA21 group. The serum 
phosphorus lowering effects were slightly greater for sevelamer compared with PA21. In the PPS, the 
mean serum phosphorus level had dropped below 1.78 mmol/L by Week 5 in the sevelamer group and 
by Week 12 in the PA21 group. 
MMRM-MAR analysis of trend over time showed that there were significant differences between 
treatment groups up to Week 12, with higher mean serum phosphorus levels for PA21 compared to 
sevelamer; however, from Week 16 there were no statistically significant differences in the FAS. 
Results for the PPS were generally consistent with the FAS; however the differences between 
treatment groups were statistically significant at later time points. 
Analyses of serum phosphorus levels over time showed that mean serum phosphorus levels tended to 
remain higher with PA21 than with sevelamer. Serum levels below the upper limit of the KDOQI target

range were reached earlier with sevelamer, which might be explained by starting with the optimal dose 
of sevelamer. 
Responder analysis – controlled serum phosphorus 
KDOQI target: A minority of patients had controlled serum phosphorus levels at baseline, 6.1% 
patients in the PA21 group and 8.4% in the sevelamer group (FAS, Table 15). A greater proportion of 
subjects in the sevelamer group compared with the PA21 group had serum phosphorus levels within 
the KDOQI range at Week 12 (54.7% versus 44.8%, respectively). By week 24, there was only a slight 
difference between treatment groups (54.4% versus 52.6%). Based on logistic models, subjects in the 
sevelamer group were more likely to have controlled serum phosphorus at week 12 according to 
KDOQI (OR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.91; p=0.010), whereas there was no statistical difference between 
groups at week 24 (OR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.34; p=0.949).

The median time for subjects to achieve control based on KDOQI was 23.0 days with PA21 and 18.6 
days with sevelamer (Figure 8). The difference in time to control was statistically significant favoring 
sevelamer (p=0.004, Kaplan-Meier analysis). The earlier onset of control was reflected in the longer 
duration of control in the sevelamer group. The mean duration of control based on KDOQI was 71.8 
days for the PA21 group and 81.4 days for the sevelamer group. 
A similar trend was observed for patients reaching normal phosphorus levels (KDIGO range: 081 to 
1.45 mol/l), but absolute numbers were much lower (data not shown).

Dose 
Dose distribution of PA21 over time in relation to KDOQI target is shown in Table 16. Most subjects 
(82.8%) were up-titrated to 7.5 g/day or above by Week 8. Of the PA21-treated subjects (292/620 
(47.1%)) who had controlled serum phosphorus levels at Week 8 (according to the KDOQI target 
range), 73 (25.0%) subjects were taking 5.0 g/day and 88 (30.1%) subjects were taking 7.5 g/day. Of 
the sevelamer-treated subjects (160/325 (49.2%)) with controlled serum phosphorus, 53 (33.2%) 
subjects were taking the recommended starting dose of 2.4 or 4.8 g/day (data not shown).

At week 12, 10% less patients on PA21 reach target levels compared to sevelamer (44.8% versus 
54.7%), whereas the percentage of patients reaching target is comparable at week 24 (52.6% versus 
54.4%). Dose distribution in relation to target shows that the majority of patients used doses of 7.5 
g/day and higher at week 8 and above. Based on these data the applicant proposes a new starting 
dose of 7.5 g/day of PA21 which also allows three times daily dosing with meals. A reference is made 
to the publication by Fishbane S, et al. A randomized, parallel, open-label study to compare once-daily 
sevelamer carbonate powder dosing with thrice-daily sevelamer hydrochloride tablet dosing in CKD 
patients on hemodialysis. Am J Kidney Dis. 2010 Feb;55(2):307-15. This study showed that thrice 
daily dosing is more effective than once-daily dosing. According to the applicant, the higher dose is 
also supported by the safety data (see Clinical safety section). 
Effects on serum total Ca, Ca X P and iPTH 
The changes from baseline for serum total Ca, Ca x P, and iPTH are summarized in Table 17.  
There were no clinically relevant changes in serum total calcium over time. The decreases in calcium-
phosphorus product were consistent with changes seen in serum phosphorus. The calcium-phosphorus 
product was below the KDOQI target level (4.4 mmol2/L2) by Week 4 in both treatment groups. Mean 
serum iPTH levels decreased during Stage 1 in the FAS, although there was considerable variability 
among subjects.

There were no changes in serum calcium levels, whereas changes in serum calcium x phosphorus 
product reflected the changes observed in serum phosphorus levels.  
Quality of Life/ Patient preference / Patient satisfaction 
Changes from baseline in quality of life scores were generally small overall. There were no trends 
observed and there were no significant differences between treatment groups for any SF-36 
components. The baseline patient satisfaction scores for their current phosphate binder for number of 
pills, ease of intake and overall satisfaction were similar for the PA21 and sevelamer treatment groups. 
There were no relevant differences observed between the 2 groups over time. 
Bone markers, Fibroblast Growth Factor 23, and vitamins 
Changes in relevant bone markers and vitamins did not reveal clinically relevant changes from baseline 
or between treatment groups. These are further discussed within the section on Clinical Safety. 
Dialysis status 
Subjects’ dietary habits (including calcium, fluids, lipid, phosphate, potassium, protein, or sodium 
chloride intake) remained generally unchanged throughout Stage 1 (Week 1 to 24) and Stage 2 
(Weeks 25 to Week 27) and there were no differences observed between treatment groups. 
Overall, the Kt/V ratios indicate that the dialysis dose remained relatively constant during the study for 
both subjects on HD and subjects on PD.  
Ancillary analyses 
Stage 1 
A greater reduction in serum phosphorus levels was seen in patients with higher baseline serum 
phosphorus levels. The interaction analyses using the ANCOVA-LOCF model to test the possible 
interaction between treatment with covariates of sex, age (<65, ≥65 years), race (White, Black, 
Other), ethnicity (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic), type of dialysis (HD or PD), time from first dialysis, reason 
for ESRD (hypertension, diabetes, other), number of prior phosphate binders (1, 2 or more) and prior 
use of sevelamer (yes, no) showed no remarkable differences in treatment effects on change from 
baseline in serum phosphorus across subgroups and no statistically significant interactions for any of 
these covariates. 
Stage 2 
There were no remarkable differences in treatment effects on the change from baseline in serum 
phosphorus across sub-groups (sex, age, race, ethnicity, and geographic region) and no significant p-
values for any of these covariates.

Design 
PA-CL-05A 
This was a 2-stage re-randomisation study: 
After a 2-4 week washout period, eligible subjects were randomised and entered Stage 1 
(serum P level >1.94 mmol/L). Stage 1 was a prospective, randomised, parallel group, open-
label, active controlled, 24-week study of PA21 compared with sevelamer. Subjects received 
an individualised MD of PA21 or sevelamer after an 8-week titration period. The objective of 
this stage was to compare the efficacy (in a non-inferiority analysis at 12 weeks) and safety 
(at 24 weeks) of PA21 versus sevelamer in patients on HD or PD. 
Stage 2, starting at Week 24, was a prospective, randomised, parallel group, open-label, 3-
week comparison of PA21 MD (dose previously titrated for efficacy) versus PA21 LD control 
(fixed dose of 1.25 g/day). The first 100 patients on HD with controlled serum P level at week 
20 (<1.78 mmo/L) entered stage 2. The objective of this stage was to compare (in a 
superiority analysis) the efficacy of the PA21 MD group to the PA21 LD control group using a 
treatment withdrawal approach. 
Patients were randomized 2:1 to PA21 or sevelamer.

with Week 27 results or the latest evaluable measurement after Week 24 when 
Week 27 was missing (LOCF). 
All subjects randomized to PA21 LD and 44 of 50 (88%) of subjects randomized to 
PA21 MD were included in the PES. Of the 6 subjects in the MD group who were 
excluded from the PES, 3 were excluded because of errors in dispensing study drug 
and 3 because of non-compliance with the protocol.

Notes 
* Logistic models were used to derive the odds ratios using treatment and baseline 
serum phosphorus value as covariates for the FAS and PES.  
Proportion of patients on target increased in PA21 between week 12 and week 24 to 
the same level as that seen for sevelamer. However, appears mostly due to a lower 
denominator whereas numerator does not change. Therefore, it is not clear whether 
more patients reach target. Additional analyses are required. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The pivotal study and most other clinical studies were performed in adult patients with chronic kidney 
disease on maintenance dialysis. No studies were performed in children and adolescents. A deferral 
was granted for the paediatric study which will commence after the data from the long-term extension 
study PA-CL-05B are available.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
N/A 
Supportive study  
Study PA1201 was a Phase 2, parallel-group, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicentre, dose-ranging (fixed dose) study which enrolled 183 Japanese ESRD patients on stable, 
maintenance HD. Treated subjects received PA21 at 3.75 g/day (N=39), 7.5 g/day (N=35), 11.25 
g/day (N=33), or 15 g/day (N=34), or placebo (N=37) for 6 weeks (FAS). All doses of PA21 
demonstrated a statistically significant lowering of serum phosphorus from baseline to Week 6 when 
compared with placebo (p<0.001). The mean change in serum phosphorus showed a dose-dependent 
decrease for the PA21 dose-groups. Mean change from baseline was 0.05 mmol/L, -0.59 mmol/L, -
0.84 mmol/L, -1.02 mmol/L, and -1.22 mmol/L with placebo, 3.75 g/day, 7.5 g/day, 11.25 g/day, and 
15.0 g/day, respectively.  
2.2.8.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Both studies PA-CL-03A (dose-finding) and PA-CL-05A (pivotal study) including the long-term 
extension phase (PA-CL-05B) were open-labelled studies. Difficulties in blinding due to difference in 
tablet intake (PA21 chewable tablet whereas sevelamer tablets needs to be swallowed as a whole) and 
the anticipated discolouring of faeces with PA21 because of its iron content, are acknowledged. PA21 
LD was used as “placebo” treatment in the withdrawal phase of study PA-CL-05A to avoid immediate 
patient unblinding. The open-label nature of the study can be acceptable as the primary endpoint 
based on serum phosphorus level is an objective endpoint and analysed by a central laboratory. 
The primary endpoint in both studies is based on serum phosphorus levels, which is the commonly 
used pharmacodynamic endpoint in clinical trials in this patient population. It is clinically relevant as 
serum phosphorus levels above a certain level correlate with increased morbidity and mortality. The 
proportion of patients within the KDOQI target range (secondary endpoint) is considered an important 
clinically relevant endpoint as is reflects the treatment goal in clinical practice. Other secondary 
endpoints were appropriate as well. The phosphate binder wash-out phase of 2-4 weeks is acceptable.  
The in-and exclusion criteria of both studies were largely similar and were adequate for the target 
population in need of treatment according to current clinical practice. Most important difference 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 79/112 
 
  
  
 
between the two studies was the more stringent threshold for hyperphosphataemia in phase 3 (serum 
phosphorus > 1.94 mmol/L compared to >1.78 mmol/L in phase 2). This resulted in more patients 
already on target at baseline within the phase 2 study. Patients previously using non-calcium based 
phosphate binders (sevelamer and lanthanum carbonate) and patients on PD were allowed to be 
included in the phase 3 study as well, making this population more representative for the target 
population. Further, intravenous iron treatment was allowed within the phase 3 study, which reflects 
clinical practice. Patients with significant gastrointestinal disorders or a history iron storage disorders 
were excluded for safety reasons in both studies. Patients need to be on a stable phosphorus diet as in 
clinical practice. 
Both studies used an active comparator, either sevelamer hydrochloride or carbonate, which are widely 
used in clinical practice in patients on maintenance dialysis. The starting dose of sevelamer was in line 
with the highest recommended starting dose (serum P>2.42 mmol/L), which is acceptable. 
Phase 2 dose-finding study PA-CL-03A 
The design of the dose-finding study (parallel group, active controlled, open-label) is considered 
adequate. Five fixed doses of PA21 were investigated (range: 1.25 g/day to 12.5 g/day), with the 
lowest dose expected to be ineffective, enabling investigation of a dose-effect trend. The comparator 
arm (sevelamer hydrochloride) allows exploring efficacy of PA21 in relation to currently available 
general accepted phosphate binder treatment. The duration of 6 weeks is considered sufficient to 
establish treatment effect as serum phosphorus levels are known to drop rapidly (within one to two 
weeks). The sample size of 19 patients per treatment group was based on the primary analysis 
(change from baseline in serum phosphorus level). Withdrawal rates were high (20% - 45% for PA21 
and 31% for sevelamer) mainly due to too low or high serum phosphorus levels resulting from the 
fixed dose regimen, which impacts interpretation of results. 
Phase 3 pivotal study PA-CL-05A 
The design of the pivotal study includes an active controlled treatment phase (stage 1) followed by a 
re-randomised withdrawal phase (stage 2) and is considered acceptable. Several aims are addressed 
within this study, i.e. superiority of PA21 over an ineffective treatment dose, non-inferiority to 
sevelamer and long-term treatment.  
The primary endpoint (change in serum phosphorus level between maintenance PA21 dose versus low, 
ineffective dose of PA21), provides information on the maintenance of effect of PA21 in patients 
responding to PA21. Demographic characteristics of the patient population appeared comparable to the 
overall responder population. More Black/African American were included as a large proportion of 
subjects from the US entered stage 2, but race was not associated with the outcome. The main 
secondary endpoint (non-inferiority to sevelamer at week 12) is considered an important endpoint as 
well. The clinical relevance of the chosen non-inferiority margin of 0.19 mmol/L was not justified. The 
proportion of patients within the KDOQI target range is of clinical relevance as it reflects clinical 
practice.  
The starting dose of 5 g/day is supported by the phase 2 study; the reason for the maximum dose of 
15 g/day is not evident based on phase 2. PA21 LD as “surrogate placebo” is supported by phase 2 
study. 
About 1.5-2 times more patients on PA21 compared to sevelamer were withdrawn during the first 
stage of the study (27.5% versus 16.0%). Most common reasons were adverse events and withdrawal 
of consent in both groups. Withdrawal due to adverse events was higher in the PA21 treatment group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 80/112 
 
  
  
One study site was closed as it was noticed by the CRO that study procedures had been performed at 2 
non-approved satellite sites. This action is considered adequate. According to the Applicant, this was 
an isolated issue. 
Phase long-term extension study PA-CL-05B 
Subjects completing PA-CL-05A could enrol into the long-term extension study up to one year of 
follow-up. Exclusion criteria including high ferritin levels and elevated liver enzymes are considered 
acceptable /reflect clinical practice. Twice as many patients on PA21 (15.4% compared to 8.5% on 
sevelamer) did not enrol into the long-term extension study, the main reason being not willing to 
provide consent in both treatment groups. It cannot be excluded that some selection has occurred 
regarding tolerability of treatment, however reported baseline demographic and disease related 
characteristics were comparable between patients enrolling study PA-CL-05B and PA-CL-05A. 
Relatively more patients from the ROW were included in the long-term study (36% versus 29%) and 
less patients from the US.  
A concern was raised on GCP compliance based on the database errors between PA-CL-05A and PA-CL-
05B identified during the long-term extension study. Further, a concern was raised based on the 
change in dialysis adequacy frequency for inclusion (from “once weekly” to “during three months”) and 
the observed missing dialysis adequacy data. Although the identified errors did not impact efficacy or 
safety a concern remains on the quality of auditing/monitoring of the studies especially taking into 
account the regional spread of the audits performed. This affects the validity of the data in general. 
Further, assurance was required that no additional treatments were performed that could affect the 
primary endpoint. Therefore the CHMP requested for a GCP inspection. The GCP inspection included 
two sponsor sites and two investigational sites (one each in Russia and Ukraine) for the pivotal phase 3 
study PA-CL-05A and the long-term extension study PA-CL-05B. The outcome of the inspection 
confirmed data integrity and the data are therefore acceptable to be used for the discussion on the 
benefit/risk as concluded by the Inspectors. Given the major findings at the investigational sites, the 
CHMP requested additional sensitivity analyses for the main efficacy endpoints excluding all Russian 
and Ukrainian sites, before concluding on the benefit/risk of the product. The results of the analyses 
were reassuring and confirmed the validity of the all data within the dossier for the benefit/risk 
discussion of the product. Furthermore, additional sensitivity analyses in which patients with missing 
values or changes in concomitant medication potentially influencing serum P-values were counted as 
non-responders confirmed the robustness of the efficacy results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Within study PA-CL-3A, baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. All PA21 
dose groups except for the lowest dose, showed a statistically significant reduction in serum 
phosphorus level from baseline. The mean reduction of the 5.0 g/day and 7.5 g/day PA21 treatment 
groups were comparable to that seen with sevelamer (FAS, around 0.34 to 0.40 mmol/l reduction). 
Higher reductions were observed with the two highest doses and the effect appears dose-related. The 
results are likely influenced by the high number of withdrawals especially for the highest dose groups 
due to serum phosphorus levels below the safety limit. The results support the choice of 5 g/day as 
starting dose for the pivotal study in which doses are up titrated based on serum phosphorus levels.  
Within study PA-CL-05A, baseline characteristics did not show marked differences between treatment 
groups at the start of study or the withdrawal phase, and between patients included in the withdrawal 
phase and the overall included population. About 8% of patients entering the study were on peritoneal 
dialysis, in line with the expected percentage (about 10%) in the general population on dialysis.

EMA/567960/2014 
Page 81/112 
 
  
  
 
Although by definition all patients were responders at start of the withdrawal phase (assessed at week 
20), about 30-40% were not on target at week 24, whereas patients were kept on a stable phosphorus 
diet. According to the Applicant, this can be explained by the natural high variability of serum 
phosphorus levels over time. Still, a variation of 30-40% is considered large given the variation seen in 
the overall population over time (roughly 10%). Also, serum phosphorus levels in the PA21 LD group 
did not return to the week 0 baseline value, suggesting that this dose shows some efficacy. This was 
also seen in individual cases in study PA-CL-03A. Despite the large variation observed and the placebo 
response which would result in a lowering of the effect, superiority of PA21 MD over PA21 LD in 
maintenance of effect was shown at the end of the withdrawal phase (mean difference of 0.54 
mmol/L).  
In the active controlled treatment phase, the serum phosphorus lowering effect of PA21 was non-
inferior to sevelamer at week 12 based on mean change in serum phosphorus level. Mean change from 
baseline is in line with that known for sevelamer. A slightly larger change from baseline was observed 
for sevelamer (mean difference of 0.08 mmol/L for the PPS or 0.10 mmol/l for the FAS, statistically 
significant). Missing data were few when non-inferiority was analysed using the PPS population at week 
12.  Non-inferiority of PA21 to sevelamer based on mean change in serum phosphorus levels was 
confirmed by post-hoc sensitivity analyses using more conservative methods for handling of missing 
data. On the other hand, the greater portion of patients in the sevelamer group compared with the 
PA21 group on KDOQI target (54.7% versus 44.8%, OR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.91) indicates a poorer 
performance of PA21. Although responder rates between treatment groups were comparable at week 
24 based on observed cases (sevelamer: 54.4% versus PA21: 52.6%) this is not supported by an 
analysis based on the ITT population (sevelamer: 44% versus PA21: 37%). Long-term data up to one 
year show that efficacy is maintained and mean serum phosphorus levels are comparable between 
treatment groups, supporting clinical relevant efficacy of PA21. Proportion on KDOQI target was 
maintained over the period of 6 to 12 months. Although it appears that proportion responders are 
somewhat lower for PA21 than on sevelamer, this difference (estimated about 7% based on ITT 
analysis) is considered acceptable given the totality of data.  
It remains unknown whether the proposed higher starting dose of 7.5 g/day PA21 will improve 
proportions on target and/or time to reach target. However, a thrice daily dosing is reasonable based 
on the number of meals/day and supported by the fact that most patients have their dose increased 
during follow-up (mean daily dose of PA21 at week 12 was 10.0 g/day and only 15% of patients were 
still on the starting dose of 5 g/day). It remains uncertain whether higher starting doses (>7.5 g 
PA21/day) would be beneficial for patients with higher baseline serum phosphorus levels (e.g.> 2.42 
mmol/L as with sevelamer). However, it can be acceptable to start treatment at a starting dose of 
Velphoro is 1,500 mg iron (3 tablets) per day for tolerability reasons and the dose can be up titrated in 
a reasonable time period.  
A post-hoc responder analysis stratified for baseline serum phosphorus levels (<2.42 mmol/L and ≥ 
2.42 mmol/L) showed comparable response rates between PA21 and sevelamer for both groups from 
week 24 onwards.   
Although the majority of patients received the maximum daily dose at week 52 (about 40%), one 
quarter of patients on PA21 received a dose of ≤7.5 g/day (1,500 mg/day iron), which supports the 
starting dose of 7.5 g/day.  
Prior to stopping phosphate binder treatment for the washout period about 34% - 38% of patients had 
serum phosphorus levels within the KDOQI range. This rate is in the same order of magnitude as 
estimated based on the ITT analysis (37% - 44%) in the clinical trial at week 24.  
Based on the mean daily doses of PA21 and sevelamer at week 12 and 24, the average number of pills 
to be taken is about 4 tablets per day with PA21 compared to 9-12 tablets per day with sevelamer. Pill

burden remained lower with PA21 during the PA-CL-05B extension study (mean 4.0/median 4.0 for 
PA21 versus mean 10.1/median 8.9 for sevelamer), consistent with results from the PA-CL-05A study 
data.This is assumed to be beneficial in terms of patient compliance.  
Change from baseline at week 12 was comparable for patients below 65 years and older (n=115 ≥ 65 
yrs) for PA21 and between treatment groups. Other subgroup analyses (age, geographic region, 
dialysis state, previous sevelamer treatment) did not show an effect of subgroup. Although the number 
of patients on PD was limited, based on current knowledge there are no indications that efficacy of 
phosphate binders depends on dialysis status. 
2.2.9.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
PA21 has demonstrated superiority in lowering serum phosphate levels at doses of 5-12.5 g/day over 
the PA21 ineffective dose of 1.25 g/day. The effect appeared dose-related and most patients required 
doses of 10-15 g/day, administered three times daily with meals. The final posology in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC has a recommended starting dose of Velphoro is 1,500 mg iron (3 tablets) per day, divided 
across the meals of the day. Velphoro is for oral administration only and must be taken with meals. 
Patients receiving Velphoro should adhere to their prescribed diets. 
Maintenance of effect has been demonstrated after 24 weeks of treatment. The phosphorus lowering 
effect of PA21 was non-inferior to sevelamer after 12 weeks of treatment. In contrast, a lower 
proportion of patients on PA21 reached KDOQI target at week 12 which is the treatment aim in daily 
clinical practice. In addition, the duration to first time on KDOQI target was longer with PA21. The 
proportion of patients on KDOQI target appeared comparable at week 24 based on observed cases but 
remains lower based on the intention-to-treat analysis. No data are available with the proposed 
starting dose of PA21 7.5 g/day, but the majority of patients needed a dose increase. A thrice daily 
dosing is reasonable allowing dosing with each meal. Withdrawal rates were higher for PA21 than for 
sevelamer, mainly related to a difference in withdrawals because of adverse events (see safety 
section). Serum phosphorus levels appeared stable up to 24 weeks. Further, in patients tolerating 
PA21 at week 24, maintenance of effect was shown up to one year of treatment and mean serum 
phosphorus levels were comparable to that observed with sevelamer. A tendency was seen for a 
slightly lower responder rate with PA21 throughout the one-year follow-up. 
The outcome of the inspection confirmed data integrity and the data are therefore acceptable to be 
used for the discussion on the benefit/risk, as concluded by the inspectors. Given the major findings at 
the investigational sites (one each in Russia and Ukraine), the CHMP requested additional sensitivity 
analyses for the main efficacy endpoints excluding all Russian and Ukrainian sites, before concluding 
on the benefit/risk of the product. The results of the analyses were reassuring and confirmed the 
validity of the all data within the dossier for the benefit/risk discussion of the product. 
2.3.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety data were available from 7 phase 1, 1 phase 2 and 1 phase 3 clinical study.  
Within the phase I studies a total of 261 healthy volunteers and 16 CKD patients received PA21 in 
doses ranging from 3.75 g/day to 15.0 g/day of PA21 (750 to 3000 mg/day). The phase 2 study 
included 128 CKD patients and the phase 3 study included 707 CKD patients treated with PA21, 
Assessment report

amounting to a total of 835 patients on dialysis treatment (778 HD and 57 PD) who received PA21 in 
doses ranging from 1.25 to 15 g PA21 /day. Within the phase 2 and 3 studies, a total of 374 patients 
received sevelamer, either as hydrochloride (n=26) or carbonate (n=348). 
Safety analyses were performed for each clinical study. Pooled safety analyses were presented for the 
5 DDI studies including 210 healthy volunteers in which each subject received a maximum of 8 doses 
of PA21 (Population 2) and for the phase 2 and phase 3 study combined (Population 1). 
The mean duration of exposure in Population 1 was 129.1 days (SD=63.2; range: 1-253 days) for 
patients treated with PA21 and 147.1 days (SD=47.4; range: 1 -218 days) for sevelamer treated 
patients.  
Duration of treatment by mean daily doses of PA21 is shown below. A total of 514 patients were 
treated for at least 24 weeks.   
Safety data based on the long-term extension study submitted within the response to Day 120 LoQ are 
described separately further on. 
Table 19: Number of subjects receiving PA21 by mean daily dose and duration of exposure 
in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies. 
Adverse events 
The percentage of patients with TEAEs was 80% in PA21 treated patients of which 17% were serious 
and 11% severe. The majority of TEAEs was of mild severity (about 70%).

Gastrointestinal TEAEs were the most common AEs among both treatment groups; 42% for PA21 and 
33.2% for sevelamer. Most commonly reported preferred terms with PA21 were diarrhoea (n=151, 
18.1%) and faeces discolored (n=124, 14.9%) which occurred more frequently in the PA21 group. 
Other GI TEAEs that were more frequent with PA21 treatment compared to sevelamer treatment 
included: upper abdominal pain (19 subjects, 2.3% versus 7 subjects, 1.9%); gastritis (14 subjects,

1.7% versus 4 subjects, 1.1%); and gastro-esophageal reflux (5 subjects, 0.6% versus no subjects). 
In addition, patients on PA21 experienced tooth discolouration (1.1% PA21) and tongue discolouration 
(0.6% PA21) which was not seen on sevelamer.  
GI TEAEs reported less frequently in the PA21 group compared to the sevelamer group included 
nausea (53 subjects, 6.3% in the PA21 group versus 40 subjects, 10.7% with sevelamer), and 
constipation (31 subjects, 3.7% versus 25 subjects, 6.7% respectively).  
Of all GI TEAEs, 247 (29.6%) in the PA21 group and 59 (15.8%) in the sevelamer group were 
considered treatment-related. The most common treatment-related GI TEAEs for PA21 were diarrhoea 
(n=96 subjects (11.5%) for PA21 and n=11 (2.9%) for sevelamer), followed by discoloured faeces 
(n=120 subjects (14.4%) for PA21 and n=1 (0.3%) for sevelamer). All tooth discolourations reported 
for PA21 were treatment-related. 
A total of 14 PA21-treated subjects (1.7%) reported severe TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders 
SOC compared with 8 subjects (2.1%) in the sevelamer group. In the PA21 group there were 2 reports 
of severe TEAEs (0.2%) for each of diarrhoea, peritonitis and GI haemorrhage. Other severe events 
were reported by single subjects.  
TEAEs within the SOC Metabolic and Nutrition Disorders were reported in 243 patients (29.1%) with 
PA21, comparable to sevelamer (26.5%). The highest frequency was reported for hyperphosphataemia 
(11.5% with PA21 versus 7.8% with sevelamer). Other TEAEs with an incidence >1% in PA21-treated 
subjects were hypercalcaemia, hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, decreased appetite, fluid overload and 
hypoglycaemia. The frequency of these events was generally similar to that in the sevelamer-treated 
subjects. Treatment-related TEAEs with PA21 were hypophosphataemia (n=34), hyperphosphataemia 
(n=22), hypercalcaemia (n=6), hypocalcaemia (n=4), decreased appetite (n=4 subjects), and 
hypoglycaemia (n=3). 
TEAEs within the SOC Infections and Infestations were reported in 166 patients (19.9%) with PA21, 
comparable to sevelamer (19.8%). Common TEAEs in the PA21 included nasopharyngitis (n=22), 
upper respiratory tract infection (n=21), bronchitis (n=19) and frequencies were comparable to those 
reported within the sevelamer treated group. For 2 subjects (0.2%) in the PA21 group TEAEs were 
considered treatment-related, including diverticulitis and influenza, each reported once.  
TEAEs within the SOC General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions were reported in 121 
patients (14.5%) with PA21, comparable to sevelamer (14.4%). Most common events were pyrexia 
(n=27 with PA21) and chest pain (n=17 with PA21). Product taste abnormal was reported more 
frequently in the PA21 treatment group (n=23, 2.8%) than in the sevelamer group (n=2, 0.5%), and 
considered treatment-related. 
TEAEs within the SOC Vascular Disorders were reported in 98 patients (11.7%) with PA21, comparable 
to sevelamer (13.9%). TEAEs reported by >1 subject included hypertension (n=51), hypotension 
(n=24) and peripheral vascular disorder (n=2) with PA21. Frequencies were comparable to that of 
sevelamer. Hypertensive crisis was more frequent in the PA21-treated group (n=5) versus no subjects 
in the sevelamer-treated group. Cases were not considered treatment-related. 
TEAEs within the SOC Cardiac Disorders were reported in 76 patients (9.1%) with PA21, comparable to 
sevelamer (8.8%). TEAEs reported by >1 subject included myocardial infarction (n=9), atrial 
fibrillation (n=9), congestive cardiac failure (n=8), and tachycardia (n=6) with PA21. No cases of acute 
myocardial infarction were reported for sevelamer. For the combined preferred terms acute myocardial 
infarction and myocardial infarction, 12 TEAEs (1.4%) were reported for PA21 compared to 3 (0.8%) 
for sevelamer. No differences were seen with regard to TEAEs associated with disorders of cardiac 
rhythm. Two cases were considered treatment-related to PA21 including arrhythmia (n=1) and 
ventricular extra systole (n=1).

TEAEs within the SOC Skin and subcutaneous Disorders were reported in 66 patients (7.9%) with 
PA21, comparable to sevelamer (6.7%). Most commonly reported events were pruritus (n=27) and 
rash (n=9) with PA21.  
Most commonly reported TEAEs within the DDI studies occurred within the Gastrointestinal Disorders, 
Nervous System Disorders and Infections and Infestations SOCs. The most commonly reported 
preferred term was discoloured faeces and headache. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
No deaths occurred in the phase 1 studies. Within the phase 2 and phase 3 clinical study, 14/835 
(1.7%) of patients on PA21 and 7/374 (1.9%) of patients on sevelamer died. One of these deaths 
occurred during the phase 2 study in the PA21 group. 
The majority of deaths were related to Cardiac Disorders (n=7, 0.8% in the PA21 group and n=5, 
1.3% in the sevelamer group), most commonly due to cardiac arrest (n=3 in the PA21 group, n=1 in 
the sevelamer group) and myocardial infarction or acute myocardial infarction (n=2 in the PA21 group, 
n=1 in the sevelamer group). Renal and Urinary Disorders accounted for 3 deaths in the PA21 group (2 
renal failures, 1 renal tubular necrosis). One death in the PA21 group was attributed to GI 
haemorrhage. No deaths were considered by the Investigators to be related to study treatment. 
Serious adverse events: One subject with CKD experienced a serious TEAE of myocardial infarction 
within a non-DDI phase 1 study, whereas one healthy subject had severe rhabdomyolysis. Both events 
were considered not-related to study drug and patients recover from the event.  
Within the phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 141 (16.9%) patients on PA21 and 71 (19.0%) 
patients on sevelamer experienced a serious TEAE. Most commonly reported SAEs were in the SOC 
Cardiac disorders, with 34 subjects (4.1%) on PA21 and 14 subjects (3.7%) on sevelamer reporting a 
serious cardiac TEAE. Acute myocardial infarction was the only PT to be reported at a frequency of 
>1% for PA21 (1.1%). Within none of the other SOCs, a PT was reported at a frequency of >1% for 
PA21. 
Serious TEAEs related to peritonitis were reported in 6 subjects (0.7 %) in the PA21 group and 
included the Preferred Terms peritonitis (n=4), peritoneal infection (n=1) and bacterial peritoneal 
infection (n=1). In comparison, serious TEAEs related to peritonitis were reported in 1 subject (0.3 %) 
in the sevelamer group (PT bacterial peritoneal infection). Most cases were subjects on PD, 2 were 
receiving HD. 
Gastrointestinal haemorrhage was reported by 3 (0.4%) subjects in the PA21 group (none in the 
sevelamer group), and was a contributor to death in two subjects. Both subjects had other risk factors 
for GI bleeding and in neither case was PA21 thought to be related to the deaths or the preceding 
haemorrhage. One subject had a duodenal ulcer haemorrhage which might be related to PA21. 
Diarrhoea was reported as a serious TEAE in 2 (0.2%) subjects receiving PA21 and 1 (0.3%) subject in 
the sevelamer group. Pancreatitis or pancreatitis acute were reported as serious TEAEs by 2 (0.2%) of 
PA21 subjects and 1 (0.3%) of sevelamer subjects. Other serious GI disorders were infrequent across 
both treatments. 
Two subjects had serious TEAEs considered by the Investigator to be related to study treatment, and 
both subjects were in the PA21-treated group (discoloured faeces and duodenal ulcer haemorrhage) in 
study PA-CL-05A. Both subjects recovered.

Long-term safety / Integrated analysis 
A total of 391 patients on PA21 and 267 patients on sevelamer were treated within the long-term 
extension study PA-CL-05B.  
In PA21-treated subjects, the overall duration of exposure for the combined PA-CL-05A/PA-CL-05B 
studies (SS) ranged from 1.0 to 420.0 days, with a mean of 243.1 days (SD=130.6). The overall 
duration of exposure during the PA-CL-05B study extension (SS5B) ranged from 3.0 to 225.0 days, 
with a mean of 176.4 days (SD=49.5). 
In sevelamer-treated subjects, the overall duration of exposure for the combined PA-CL-05A/PA-CL-
05B studies ranged from 13.0 to 413.0 days, with a mean of 294.1 days (SD=112.4). The overall 
duration of exposure during PA-CL-05B ranged from 5.0 to 215.0 days, with a mean of 181.5 days 
(SD=41.9). With continued treatment in PA-CL-05B, 319 subjects completed at least 52 weeks 
(approximately 12 months) of treatment with PA21. 
The Table below illustrates the absolute numbers and percentage of subjects at each dose level at the 
start of Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, and Week 52 treatment periods during studies 05A/5B. 
Table 22: Number of subjects by PA21 dose over 52 weeks in PA-CL_05A/05B, SS 
In studies 05A/05B, mean (±SD) overall exposure to PA21 (all doses) was 243.1 ± 130.6 days for 707 
subjects (SS). The number of subjects who received 1,500 mg/day at some point in the trial was 609, 
and their average duration of exposure to the 1,500 mg/day dose was 57.6 ± 82.7 days. A total of 610 
subjects were exposed to at least 1,500 mg/day for an average duration of 223.7 days (median 226.5, 
range: 2-406).  
Overall, the proportion of subjects reporting at least 1 TEAE during the combined PA-CL-05A and PA-
CL-05B studies was 88.7%, with a similar proportion in the PA21 and sevelamer groups (88.8% and 
88.5%, respectively). The overall TEAE profiles for the 2 treatment groups were similar with the 
exception of higher incidence in PA21-treated subjects for treatment-related TEAEs (45.3% with PA21 
versus 24.7% with sevelamer) and withdrawals for TEAEs (20.9% versus 10.3%). These differences 
were driven by GI TEAEs.

The most commonly reported TEAEs while on PA21 were in the SOCs Gastrointestinal Disorders 
(52.5%), Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (37.8%), Infections and Infestations (29.7%), General 
Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (21.1%) and Vascular Disorders (21.1%). For sevelamer, 
corresponding frequencies were in the SOCs Gastrointestinal Disorders (42.8%), Metabolism and 
Nutrition Disorders (39.7%), Infections and Infestations (32.5%), General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions (25.0%) and Vascular Disorders (24.1%). Apart from the SOC 
Gastrointestinal Disorders there were no SOCs with an increased frequency for PA21. 
The distribution of TEAEs by SOCs was similar for PA-CL-05A and PA-CL-05B except for the GI TEAEs. 
The incidence of TEAEs in the GI SOC was notably lower in PA-CL-05B in both treatment groups, and 
particularly in the PA21 treatment group (45.1% in PA-CL-05A versus 25.6% in PA-CL-05B).

The most common GI events (occurring in >5.0%) in patients on PA21 were diarrhoea (23.6%), 
discoloured faeces (16.1%), nausea (9.8%) and constipation (5.1%). In the sevelamer group, the 
most common GI events were nausea (14.4%), diarrhoea (11.5%), vomiting (9.2%), abdominal pain 
(9.2%) and constipation (8.3%). Only 3 cases of diarrhoea with PA21 (Subjects 404-913, 410-901 and 
874-905) and 2 cases with sevelamer (Subject 866-922 and 873-909) were classified as serious during 
the combined studies. 
In both treatment groups the highest incidence of GI TEAEs was during the first 4 weeks of treatment. 
Discoloured faeces, which were reported almost exclusively in the PA21 group, were almost all 
reported during the first 4 weeks of treatment. In the PA21 group, diarrhoea was also reported more 
frequently during the first 4 weeks of treatment, the incidence reduced over time to a level of around 4 
to 5% from Week 24 onwards. Other common GI events, nausea, vomiting and constipation, occurred 
at a similar low incidence throughout the 52 weeks of treatment. 
Within the integrated analysis, a total of 320 (45.3%) of patients on PA21 reported treatment-related 
TEAEs compared to 86 (24.7%) of patients on sevelamer. The most commonly reported treatment-
related TEAEs (≥2 %) were faeces discoloured (110; 15.6%), diarrhoea (92, 13.0%), nausea (28; 
4.0%), hypophosphatemia (28; 4.0%), product taste abnormal (27; 3.8%), hyperphosphataemia (24; 
3.4%), constipation (21; 3.0%), vomiting (15; 2.1%), and dyspepsia (14; 2.0%). For patients on 
sevelamer, the most commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs were nausea (18; 5.2%), 
constipation (17; 4.9%), hypophosphataemia (13; 3.7%), and diarrhoea (8; 2.3%). 
Death and serious adverse events 
Thirty-five subjects experienced fatal TEAEs during the study (PA-CL-05A and PA-CL-05B combined) or 
within 30 days of the last dose of study medication: 21 (3.0%) of PA21-treated subjects and 14 
(4.0%) of sevelamer-treated subjects. The onset of the fatal TEAEs occurred during PA-CL-05A in 21 
subjects and during PA-CL-05B in 14 subjects. None of the deaths was considered related to study 
treatment. The causes of death were generally consistent with the medical conditions of ESRD patients 
on dialysis. As expected in this patient population, a large proportion of deaths (42.9%) were related 
to cardiac disorders. There was no indication of major differences in cause of death between treatment 
groups and there was no association between the incidence of fatal TEAEs and maximum daily dose. 
Serious adverse events occurred in 188 (26.6%) of PA21-treated subjects and 103 (29.6%) of 
sevelamer-treated subjects. In PA-CL-05B, serious TEAEs were reported in 19.9% and 19.5%, 
respectively. The largest proportions of serious TEAEs in the integrated PA-CL-05A/PA-CL-05B 
analysis were associated with the SOCs of Infections and Infestations (n=63; 8.9% for PA21 and 
n=34; 9.8%) for sevelamer) and Cardiac Disorders (n=44; 6.2% for PA21 and n=23; 6.6% for 
sevelamer).  
Serious TEAEs by preferred term and reported for ≥1% of patient on PA21 were pneumonia (n=13, 
1.8%), sepsis (n=7, 1.0%), acute myocardial infarction (n=10, 1.4%), congestive cardiac failure (n=9, 
1.3%), fluid overload (n=8, 1.1%), and chest pain (n=11, 1.6%). Serious TEAEs by preferred term 
and reported for ≥1% of patient on sevelamer were pneumonia (n=8, 2.3%), sepsis (n=4, 1.1%), 
atrial fibrillation (n=5, 1.4%), AV fistula thrombosis (n=4, 1.1%), dyspnoea (n=5, 1.4%), fluid 
overload (n=9, 2.6%), chest pain (n=6, 1.7%), anaemia (n=6, 1.7%).   
Serious peritonitis (6 with PA21 and 1 with sevelamer) and serious diarrhoea (3 with PA21 and 2 with 
sevelamer) were the only serious GI disorders reported in >0.5% of subjects in either group. All 
serious peritonitis events occurred in subjects on PD.

Serious GI bleedings were reported in 4 patients on PA21, 1 duodenal ulcer haemorrhage, 1 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage and 2 upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. A total of 5 patients reported 
serious GI bleeding on sevelamer; 2 duodenal ulcer haemorrhage, 2 gastrointestinal haemorrhage and 
2 upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. 
Treatment-related serious TEAEs occurred in 4 subjects. Three subjects on PA21 reported a total of 4 
events, duodenal ulcer haemorrhage, faeces discoloured, gastric disorder and upper GI haemorrhage. 
One subject on sevelamer reported a GI haemorrhage which was considered treatment-related. All 
patients recovered without sequelae upon treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology parameters: The majority of patients had subnormal Hgb levels at baseline. The number 
of TEAEs in this group was limited and no differences were observed between treatment groups. 
Coagulation parameters: There was no demonstrable effect of PA21 on coagulation parameters. TEAEs 
were reported in 13 (1.6%) of patients with PA21 and 3 (0.8%) patients with sevelamer.  
Clinical chemistry parameters: There were no significant changes with PA21. HDL, LDL and 
triglycerides showed modest reductions with sevelamer. 
Liver enzyme parameter: Alkaline phosphatase levels increased during treatment with a mean change 
of 8.59 IU/L (SD=30.12) with PA21 and 20.97 IU/L (SD=38.65) with sevelamer at last observation. 
Increases were about twice as high in females compared to males. No important changes were seen 
for other liver enzyme parameters. 
Iron status parameters: Baseline serum ferritin levels were high. Serum iron, serum ferritin and serum 
TSAT levels increased during treatment with PA21 in study PA-CL-05A (Table 13). Data from the 
radiolabelled iron absorption study indicated that iron absorption was between 0-0.44% in ESRD 
patients.

Vitamins: No clinically significant changes were seen in the circulating levels 1,25-hydroxy-vitamin D,  vitamin A, 
E  or  K.  Modes  reductions  were  seen  in  25-hydroxy-vitamin  D  levels  in  both  treatment  groups,  which  were  not 
considered clinically relevant.  
Calcium,  phosphorus,  parathyroid  hormone  and  bone  parameters:  Serum  phosphorus  levels  decreased  over 
time,  whereas  calcium  levels  remained  stable.  Ca  X  P  product  decreases  reflected  the  decreased  in  serum 
phosphorus. iPTH did not change substantially.   
Significant changes in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were seen for both treatment groups, similar as those 
observed for total alkaline phosphatase. Fibroblast growth factor-23 appeared to decrease slightly over time, but 
ranges were broad (-27.9 g / d l ( S D= 2 3 4 )  fo r  PA2 1  a n d  -45.6 g / L ( S D= 2 1 9 )  fo r  s e v e la m e r ) .   
Vital signs and physical findings 
There were no clinically relevant changes in the physical examination findings. 
ECG recordings: Mean changes from BL to week 12, week 24, and endpoint in PQ, QRS, QT and RR 
intervals and the HR were not statistically or clinically relevant. Results between treatment groups 
were comparable.  
Long-term data: 
Laboratory values 
Iron parameters: 
In the pooled PA-CL-05A/PA-CL-05B studies (SS), TEAEs related to increased iron parameters were 
reported by a similar proportion of subjects in both treatment groups: 20 (2.8%) subjects treated with 
PA21 and 10 (2.9%) subjects treated with sevelamer. In PA-CL-05B (SS5B), TEAEs related to 
increased iron parameters were reported by a slightly larger proportion of subjects in the PA21 group: 
10 (2.6%) subjects treated with PA21 versus 3 (1.1%) subjects treated with sevelamer. 
None of these events was severe, considered serious or led to withdrawal. Most of the subjects were 
also receiving concomitant IV iron and/or ESA.

Iron overload was considered related to treatment in 2 patients on PA21. Both patients received the 
maximum dose of PA21 (12.5 g/day). One patient had elevated TSAT (80%) and iron (48.1 m o l/ L)  
but no increased ferritin. The iron overload resolved without treatment and PA21 was continued. One 
patient reported increased ferritin levels (3.087 pmol/L). PA21 dose was maintained until the end of 
the study and the event was ongoing at that time.   
Mean changes from baseline in serum ferritin and TSAT showed significantly larger increases in the 
PA21 group compared with the sevelamer group, especially during the first 24 weeks of treatment. 
Thereafter, the differences in ferritin and TSAT between treatments groups were maintained. 
No clinically meaningful changes in haemoglobin levels were observed in either treatment group. 
Other laboratory evaluations: 
Serum calcium values remained relatively stable throughout the studies in both treatment groups over 
52 weeks. There were no clinically meaningful changes in serum iPTH and no differences between 
treatment groups over 52 weeks. 
Transitory Vitamin D decreases were observed in both treatment groups; these may be associated with 
seasonal factors.  
Significant increases from baseline in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were observed in both 
treatment groups. Increases were generally greater in the sevelamer group. Differences between 
groups were not statistically significant except at the combined endpoint. Mean values were greater for 
female subjects at baseline and mean changes during treatment were greater in females than males. 
There were no other clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters and no relevant differences 
observed between treatment groups over 52 weeks. 
Vital signs and physical findings 
There were no significant effects on vital signs, ECGs or physical examination findings and there were 
no differences observed between treatment groups over 52 weeks. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses were presented for the intrinsic factors gender, age, and race. Further, subgroup 
analyses were performed for extrinsic factors like geographic region.  
Gender: There were 476 males and 359 females treated with PA21. The incidence of TEAEs was 79.6% 
for males and 80.5% for females. Incidence and nature of TEAEs were in general comparable between 
males and females, without marked differences between sexes in severe and serious TEAEs, 
discontinuations due to a TEAE, or deaths.  
Age: There were 462 patients below 65 years and 248 patients of 65 years and older that received 
treatment with PA21. Proportions of any TEAE and number of deaths were somewhat higher in patients 
≥  65 years. A higher proportion of patients ≥  65 years discontinued treatment (21.8 % versus 
14.8%). This was also seen for sevelamer (12.1% versus 5.8%). Incidence and nature of TEAEs did 
not show marked differences between age groups. A slight difference was seen for TEAEs in the SOC 
Gastrointestinal Disorders with higher frequencies of diarrhoea for patients ≥  65 years (21.% versus 
16.7%). The same trend was observed for treatment-related GI TEAEs and events leading to 
discontinuation in the SOC Gastrointestinal Disorders (5.6% versus 1.2% discontinued due to 
diarrhoea in patients ≥  65 years and <65 years, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 93/112 
 
  
  
 
Race: The majority of patients treated with PA21 was white (n=668), followed by black (n=134). There 
was a slightly higher incidence of TEAEs in Black patients (88.8% versus 78.0%) and a higher 
incidence of serious TEAEs (21.6% versus 16.0%). For the SOC Gastrointestinal Disorders, incidence 
was slightly higher in the White group compared to the Black group (19.2% versus 12.7%).  
Geographic region: In total, 360 patients were treated within the US, 215 in EU and 260 in ROW. For 
PA21, the incidence of TEAEs was highest in the US (n=325, 90.3%), followed by EU (n=175, 81.4%) 
and lowest in the ROW region (n=168, 64.6%). In all regions, the majority of TEAEs were in the SOC 
Gastrointestinal Disorders and included diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. 
CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis: 
In total, 57 patients on PD were treated with PA21 versus 30 with sevelamer. Forty subjects (70.2%) 
experienced any TEAE with PA21 treatment versus 24 patients with sevelamer treatment (80%).  
In 5 of 57 PA21-treated subjects 6 episodes of peritonitis were registered (8.8%) versus 3 episodes in 
30 sevelamer-treated subjects (6.7%) during a treatment period of maximal 6 months. No clinically 
relevant differences were observed between PA21 treated and sevelamer treated PD patients. 
The proportions of subjects who had serious or severe TEAEs, who were withdrawn for 
TEAEs or died, were similar for HD and PD groups. 
Immunological events 
Four cases with hypersensitivity reaction on PA21 were reported within the first 6 months, which were 
not related to treatment. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No obvious interactions between PA21 use and typical medications taken by subjects with ESRD have 
been identified from the clinical trial program to date. Subjects taking aluminium, calcium or 
magnesium-containing antacids as well as oral iron preparations were excluded from the clinical trials 
due to the potential for interference with phosphate binding.   
As absorption of PA21 is considered minimal and PA21 is not metabolised or excreted by the liver, 
potential interactions are considered to be restricted to the GI tract. Five DDI studies in healthy 
volunteers did not show interactions in terms of bioavailability for a wide variety of relevant drugs, i.e. 
losartan, furosemide, digoxin, warfarin and omeprazole. In vitro several drugs have been evaluated for 
the potential to adsorb to PA21. Although adsorption was shown in vitro, the in vivo interaction studies 
showed no interaction. However, it is unclear to which extent in vivo interactions, i.e. PA21 affecting 
absorption of co-administered drugs, can be ruled out based upon in vitro data or in general. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Overall, a total of 141 PA21-treated subjects (16.9%) were discontinued from treatment due to an AE, 
compared with 29 (7.8%) sevelamer-treated subjects. The main SOCs, with events that led to 
discontinuation in both treatment groups, were Gastrointestinal Disorders: 61 (7.3%) PA21-treated 
subjects and 13 (3.5%) sevelamer-treated subjects; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: 40 (4.8%) 
PA21-treated subjects and 4 (1.1%) sevelamer-treated subjects; and General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions: 17 (2.0%) PA21-treated subjects and 3 (0.8%) sevelamer-treated

subjects. The most frequent PTs causing discontinuation in PA21-treated subjects were diarrhoea (21 
subjects, 2.5%), hyperphosphataemia (17 subjects, 2.0%), hypophosphataemia (14 subjects, 1.7%) 
and nausea (11 subjects, 1.3%); and in sevelamer-treated subjects were constipation (5 subjects, 
1.3%), and diarrhoea (4 subjects, 1.1%). 
Long term data: 
During PA-CL-05B, a larger proportion of subjects were withdrawn for TEAEs in the PA21 group: 32 
subjects (8.2%) in the PA21 group and 13 subjects (4.9%) in the sevelamer group. The most common 
reason for discontinuation in both treatment groups was hyperphosphataemia, which led to 
discontinuation in 11 subjects (2.8%) in the PA21 group and in 7 subjects (2.6%) in the sevelamer 
group. Seven subjects (1.8%) in the PA21 group withdrew from PA-CL-05B due to GI TEAEs compared 
to 1 (0.4%) in the sevelamer group.  
In the integrated analysis, more subjects in the PA21 group compared with the sevelamer group were 
withdrawn from treatment for TEAEs (148; 20.9% versus 36; 10.3%, respectively). Gastrointestinal 
TEAEs were the most common class of TEAEs leading to withdrawal in both groups, accounting for 70 
of 148 withdrawals (47.3%) in the PA21 group and 11 of 36 (30.6%) in the sevelamer group. The GI 
TEAEs leading to withdrawal were severe in only 6 subjects in the PA21 group and 6 subjects in the 
sevelamer group. The most frequent PTs (≥1.0%) causing discontinuation in PA21-treated subjects 
were diarrhoea (25 subjects, 3.5%), hyperphosphataemia (23 subjects, 3.3%), hypophosphataemia 
(14 subjects, 1.7%), nausea (11 subjects, 1.6%), product taste abnormal (13 subjects, n=1.8%), 
constipation (7 subjects, 1.0%), and vomiting (7 subjects, 1.0%); and in sevelamer-treated subjects 
were hyperphosphataemia (7 subjects, 2.0%), and constipation (5 subjects, 1.4%). 
Overall, a larger proportion of subjects in the PA21 treatment group were withdrawn as a result of 
treatment-related TEAEs: 12.7% (n=90) of PA21-treated subjects versus 2.9% (n=10) of sevelamer-
treated subjects. Events in the GI Disorders SOC were the treatment-related TEAEs that most often led 
to withdrawal (n=61 and n=7 for the PA21 and sevelamer groups, respectively). The most common 
treatment-related TEAE leading to withdrawal were diarrhea (n=22), product taste abnormal (n=13) 
and nausea (n=10) for patients on PA21. The most common treatment-related TEAE leading to 
withdrawal for patients on sevelamer was constipation (n=4).  
2.3.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Velphoro is based on a total of 778 patients on haemodialysis and 57 patients on 
peritoneal dialysis, who received Velphoro treatment of up to 55 weeks.  
Based on the integrated data including the long-term extension study it is estimated that about 610 
patients were treated with at least 7.5 g/day PA21 (1,500 mg/day) with a mean duration of 223.7 days 
and 335 received this dose for at least 6 months. This is considered sufficient to assess the common 
AEs.  
The population included is representative of the target population on maintenance dialyses. A minority 
of patients (n=57, 6.8%) were on PD. Most patients were Caucasian and treated within the US. There 
are no indications of markedly qualitative differences in safety profile between geographic regions / 
races and data can be considered valid for the EU population. However, consistently lower TEAEs rates 
were reported in ROW versus US and EU, especially within study PA-CL-05A. Based on the observed 
differences, a concern was raised on the conduct of the study in general, and throughout regions. The 
outcome of the GCP inspection confirmed that the data are acceptable for a discussion on the 
benefit/risk of the product, which was confirmed by the additional analyses excluding Russian and 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014

Ukrainian sites. The differences in frequencies of AE reporting throughout geographic regions might 
(partly) be explained by differences in patient population with regard to age, severity of underlying 
disease and culture in reporting of adverse events. This is acceptable to the CHMP also given that no 
issues on validity of data remained.   
The percentage of patients with any TEAE was high, which is to be expected in this population with 
extensive co-morbidity. The most commonly reported TEAEs for PA21 were within the SOC of 
Gastrointestinal Disorders, which was also the SOC wherein TEAEs were most commonly reported as 
treatment-related AEs. This reflects the fact that the drug is hardly absorbed. Most commonly reported 
gastrointestinal TEAEs were diarrhoea (18.1% in study PA-CL-05A and 23.6% based on integrated 
study 5A/5B) and discoloured faeces (14.9% in study PA-CL-05A and 16.1% based on integrated study 
5A/5B). Diarrhoea appeared dose-related based on phase 1 studies, but this was not confirmed by the 
phase 2 clinical study. Uncertainty remains on a dose relationship as the majority of patients started 
with a lower dose and were subsequently up titrated.  Although it cannot be excluded that TEAEs might 
be higher at the proposed starting dose of 7.5 g/day PA21, there are no signals that this would lead to 
major changes in frequencies. This is based on the current data using uptitrated doses, which show no 
signs of increased risk of TEAEs or new safety signals including doses twice as high as the proposed 
starting dose. Further, the most commonly reported adverse events are considered manageable and 
once discontinued, the patient can be switched to other available safe and effective phosphate binders.    
The frequency of adverse events (included in SmPC section 4.8) included all patients treated during 
the clinical trials including patients following the lower dose of PA21. Discoloured faeces because of the 
iron content of PA21 are expected, and most likely experienced by all patients. It has the potential to 
mask gastrointestinal blood loss; however, the Applicant has presented reassuring data that it does not 
interfere with the standard laboratory tests. Relevant information is included in SmPC section 4.5. A 
warning on masking and delaying diagnosis of potential GI bleeding is currently included in section 4.4 
of the SmPC. Abnormal product taste but also tooth discolouring are expected findings due to the iron 
content of PA21 and are included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Abnormal taste in combination with other 
GI events might have a negative effect on treatment compliance in daily practice, but the impact is not 
easily assessed from clinical studies.  
Patients with a wide range of gastrointestinal disorders were excluded from the studies and a warning 
is included in SmPC section 4.4. The type of patients that might be considered more vulnerable 
patients with an increased risk of GI or other adverse events (e.g. patients with motility disturbances 
or damage to the intestinal wall) were limited within the studies. PA21 should be used carefully in 
these patients and use in these patients should be followed up post-registration as part of the 
PSURs/RMP. 
Use in patient population with a history or evidence of significant GI disorders is included as missing 
information in the RMP. There are currently no safety signals (including preclinical) that warrant a 
contraindication. 
The irritation seen in mice was considered related to the bulk substance and neoplasms were not likely 
related to PA21. The preclinical findings were assessed to be species-specific and not to have 
implications for human safety. 
The second most commonly reported TEAEs were within the SOC Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders, 
with the most commonly reported event being hyperphosphataemia. This may partly reflect a 
suboptimal starting dose. Within the SOC Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders, pruritus and rash 
were considered treatment-related events which are also known for other phosphate binders. There 
were no signs of increased infection rates or interference with nutrient absorption, or absorption of 
copper ions. In addition, hypersensitivity reactions were rare.  
Overall, TEAEs were reported more frequently on PA21 compared to sevelamer, which is largely 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 96/112 
 
  
  
explained by the differences in gastrointestinal events and hyperphosphataemia. The majority of TEAEs 
reported within the other SOCs, did not show markedly differences between PA21 and sevelamer. As 
gastrointestinal TEAEs were in general mild and resolved during the study, this is not necessarily a 
matter of concern. The lower frequencies with sevelamer might partly be explained by the fact that 
one third of the population had already used sevelamer prior to the study, but is not likely to account 
for all differences observed. Gastrointestinal events more frequently experienced within the sevelamer 
group were nausea, vomiting and constipation. More patients discontinued on PA21 compared to 
sevelamer because of adverse events. Although the majority of patients discontinued early, 85/707 
(12%) patients on PA21 discontinued during the maintenance phase of PA-CL-05A compared to 25/348 
(7%) patients on sevelamer. The main reasons for withdrawal in this time period were again TEAEs 
other than those due to blood phosphorus or calcium levels (n=32) or withdrawal by subject (n=16). 
Discontinuation rates were markedly lower for patients in the long-term extension study on PA21 which 
can be expected, but still higher than for sevelamer. 
The clinical relevance of the observed increase in serum ferritin level and also transferrin saturation 
levels with PA12 is not known. Absolute serum ferritin levels were in the same order of magnitude as 
with sevelamer, and TEAE suggestive of potential iron overload were observed in similar proportions 
between treatment groups (about 2%). Only 1 event was considered related to PA21. Taking into 
account the one year follow-up data, frequencies of TEAEs related to iron parameters were slightly 
increased but still reported by a similar proportion of subjects in both treatment groups: 20 (2.8%) 
subjects treated with PA21 and 10 (2.9%) subjects treated with sevelamer. None of these events was 
severe, considered serious or led to withdrawal. One additional event was considered treatment-
related to PA21, mounting up to a total of 2 events.  
The radiolabeled study showed that a very limited amount of iron is absorbed in ESRD patients (0-0. 
044%). In case of the maximum dose of 3000 mg iron/day (15 g PA21/day) and a maximal absorption 
of 0.04%, this would mean a maximal daily absorption of 1.2 mg iron/day or 36 mg/month. Therefore, 
absolute iron absorption is not negligible but low compared to the amount given to patients through IV 
infusions, mounting up to 190 mg/month.  
Although serum ferritin and TSAT levels increased within the first 6 months and were higher for PA21 
than for sevelamer, one-year data in patients tolerating PA21 did not show a further increase in iron 
status parameters. Iron status parameters of patients not entering the long-term extension study were 
comparable to those of patients entering the study. Post-hoc stratified analyses for patients with and 
without IV infusions showed that the increase was seen in patients receiving IV iron but not in patients 
receiving only PA21. Further, there were no signs of early toxicity or an increased risk of adverse 
events related to iron overload and absolute changes in iron parameters were small. Although the risk 
over longer periods of use is not known, the risk of iron accumulation could be manageable through 
routine monitoring of relevant iron status parameters. Prescribers should in that case be warned on the 
risk of additional iron absorption from PA21 and special attention should be paid to the long-term 
follow-up of potentially iron-related adverse events.  
Preclinical data were reassuring based on additional data/analysis and did not indicate significant iron 
(-particle) absorption. 
Patients with a history of haemochromatosis or other iron accumulation disorders were excluded from 
the clinical trials and PA21 is contraindicated in these patients. Deaths were reported at low and 
comparable rates between PA21 and sevelamer, mostly related to cardiac disorders. None were 
considered treatment-related. Also, most commonly reported serious TEAEs were reported within the 
SOC Infections and Infestations and the SOC Cardiac Disorders, in line with the underlying co-
morbidity of ESRD patients. Serious GI bleedings were reported in few patients, 4 on PA21 and 5 on 
sevelamer. One case of serious duodenal ulcer haemorrhage and one case of upper GI haemorrhage 
Assessment report

within the PA21 group was considered to be treatment-related. No effect was seen on coagulation 
parameters and preclinical findings are reassuring as these did not reveal an increased risk of bleeding 
and the irritation and neoplasms observed were considered species-specific and not relevant for 
humans. Based on the long-term data, there were eight cases of peritonitis in patients on PD with 
PA21 (14.0%) compared to three cases on sevelamer (10%), however this is an expected adverse 
event in this population and overall rates were low. This can be explained as patients with a history of 
peritonitis were excluded from the clinical studies. This is addressed in SmPC section 4.4 and the RMP. 
Gastrointestinal TEAEs remained the majority of TEAEs and nature of events was comparable to that in 
HD. The limited number of patients precludes a meaningful interpretation of observed differences with 
patient on HD. Some events more frequently reported in PD compared to HD can be explained by the 
dialysis procedure and there are at the moment no indications of a different safety profile. Given the 
limited number of patients on PD, use in patient population with a history or evidence of significant GI 
disorders is included as missing information in the RMP.  Next to this use in patient population with 
CKD Stage 1-4 is included as important potential risk in the RMP. A sufficient number of patient’s ≥65 
years were included in the studies, including above 74 years of age. There were no signs of 
unexpected increases in AEs or new AEs. 
In vitro several drugs have been evaluated for the potential to adsorb to PA21. Although adsorption 
was shown in vitro, the in vivo interaction studies showed no interaction. The interaction potential 
seems low, however, it is unclear to which extent in vivo interactions, i.e. PA21 affecting absorption of 
co-administered drugs, can be ruled out based upon in vitro data or in general. This may especially of 
concern with narrow therapeutic drugs. This has been included in section 4.5 of the SmPC as well as a 
precaution that Velphoro is almost not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. When administering 
any medicinal product that is known to interact with iron, the medicinal product should be 
administered at least one hour before or two hours after Velphoro.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
tabular form in section 4.8 of SmPC. 
2.3.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of PA21 is mainly characterised by gastrointestinal adverse events of mild nature, 
which reflects its local action and limited absorption. Most commonly observed events were diarrhoea 
and discoloured faeces. Gastrointestinal events were reported more frequently with PA21 compared to 
sevelamer and more often led to study discontinuation. This might render the product somewhat less 
favourable for long-term treatment. The extension period of 6-12 months did not indicate new safety 
signals and almost half of the patients continued treatment for one year. Preclinical findings on 
neoplasms were considered species-specific and not relevant for humans. Iron absorption was limited, 
but not negligible, and did not lead to clinically relevant changes in iron status parameters. Long-term 
treatment for one-year in patients tolerating PA21 did not indicate further iron accumulation. These 
data suggest that the risk of iron accumulation is low and can be managed by routine monitoring and 
further follow-up of iron-related adverse events post-approval. The planned PASS will provide relevant 
data to characterise and evaluate this potential risk. Preclinical data were reassuring based on 
additional data/analysis and did not indicate significant iron (-particle) absorption. 
The outcome of the inspection confirmed data integrity and the data are therefore acceptable to be 
used for the discussion on the benefit/risk, as concluded by the inspectors. Given the major findings at 
the investigational sites (one each in Russia and Ukraine), the CHMP requested additional sensitivity 
analyses for the main efficacy endpoints excluding all Russian and Ukrainian sites, before concluding 
Assessment report

on the benefit/risk of the product. The results of the analyses were reassuring and confirmed the 
validity of the all data within the dossier for the benefit/risk discussion of the product. 
2.3.3 Third party interventions related to safety 
During the validation phase of the centralised procedure for Velphoro an anonymous letter was 
received from a third party by the EMA d.d. 18th of January 2013.  CHMP commented on the questions 
in this anonymous letter by referring to the questions raised to the Applicant during the evaluation 
procedure. The safety profile is assessed based on the data submitted within the dossier which is 
considered to be the most informative and the most relevant for the product in the target population. 
This cannot be replaced by literature data from other products and most likely in different settings as 
these references were published 10-30 years ago. Furthermore, the data cited in the anonymous letter 
on iron-related toxicity at doses mentioned in literature cannot be directly applied to the administered 
dose of iron in the form of PA21. The majority of the iron within the complex is not soluble and 
therefore not readily available for absorption.  It is agreed that part of the patient population might be 
treated with PA21 for several years. Therefore at least one year data are needed to assess the long-
term safety profile. Regular monitoring of serum iron status parameters might mitigate the risk of iron 
overload. Furthermore, the CHMP cannot comment on unpublished data cited in the anonymous letter, 
or on studies that have been stopped and presumably not submitted. 
At Day 120 of the procedure, there was concern regarding adenocarcinomas in the colon of mice. An 
anonymous letter was received from a third party by the EMA dated October 3rd, 2013. In this letter 
some concerns are raised concerning the promotional materials and the dose to be administered per 
day. An explicit concern is raised on the administered dose of 1,000 mg iron/day because of the 
potential oxidative stress in the stomach and intestine. The iron (III)-oxyhydroxide active moiety of 
PA21 powder is insoluble with a low iron release (limit: ≤ 5.0% m/m). Therefore, the safety profile of 
the proposed iron dose within PA21 cannot be directly related to other iron preparations used in clinical 
practice.  
An anonymous letters was received from a third party by the EMA d.d. 5th November 2013 and a 
second one dated 21th of November 2013.  The issues raised in the third and fourth anonymous letter 
were comparable to those raised in the initial two letters. The safety of the product with respect to 
iron-related toxicity, including long-term safety, has been addressed within the various assessment 
reports up till now. It is the conclusion of the CHMP that there is no aggravated risk for 
adenocarcinoma in rats that received PA21. Based on the assessment as laid down in the current 
reports, the uncertainties on the safety profile are resolved and the safety profile of the product is 
acceptable with adequate risk minimization measures as laid down in the RMP and reflected in the 
SmPC.  
At Day 180, a re-examination of these lesions was performed, resulting in a re-classification of a large 
part of the adenocarcinomas to diverticula. The cellular/tissue characteristics on which this re-
classification is based can be followed by the assessor. However, at Day 180 a concern remained on 
the re-evaluation of the carcinogenicity findings which was not performed according to agreed 
principles.

2.4.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.    
2.5.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 4.0 the PRAC considers by consensus 
that the risk management system for sucroferric oxyhydroxide (mixture of polynuclear iron(III)-
oxyhydroxide, sucrose and starches (Velphoro) for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult CKD 
on HD or PD within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium 
supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3, calcimimetics or one of its analogues to control the 
development of renal bone disease could be acceptable provided an updated risk management plan 
and satisfactory responses to the List of Questions below are submitted: 
1.  Given the limited number of patients on PD in the clinical trials the Applicant’s position that the 
safety from the larger HD group can be extrapolated to the smaller PD population cannot be 
supported. Patients on peritoneal dialysis should be listed as missing information in the RMP. 
2.  As Velphoro is a new product intended for long-term use potentially over many years, it is 
considered that the safety concerns with this product identified in the RMP cannot be 
adequately addressed through routine pharmacovigilance. The Applicant should propose an 
observational post-marketing safety study (PASS) to investigate the long-term safety of PA21 
(over 1 year). In particular this study should collect information on long-term safety, iron 
accumulation, masking of potential GI bleeding, and use in patients with PD. The Applicant 
should also discuss the feasibility as to whether markers of GI irritation/inflammation as a 
possible mechanism for diarrhoea in patients exposed to PA21 could be measured in the PASS. 
Following the PRAC meeting in June 2014, the Applicant submitted an updated Risk Management Plan, 
version 5.0 addressing these issues and therefore the Risk Management Plan is considered acceptable. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.6.  User consultation

applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
PA21 has been shown to lower serum phosphorus levels in patients on dialysis with 
hyperphosphataemia. The absolute mean phosphorus lowering effect was -0.71 mmol/L after 12 weeks 
in the single pivotal study (p<0.001) at a starting dose of 5 g/day. Serum phosphorus levels remained 
stable during 12-24 weeks. The proportion of patients on phosphorus levels within the target range 
(1.13 to 1.78 mmol/L) increased from 6.1% at baseline to 44.8% and 52.6% at week 12 and 24, 
respectively, supporting clinical relevant efficacy. Most patients needed doses between 10-15 g/day.  
Maintenance of effect was shown during the 3 week withdrawal phase starting after 24 weeks of 
treatment (difference of 0.54 mmol/L compared to a low dose PA21, p<0001). A trend for a dose-
effect relationship was shown in the dose-finding study for doses between 5.0 -12.5 g/day.   
The serum phosphorus lowering effect after 12 weeks was comparable to that obtained with sevelamer 
(mean difference 0.08 mmol/L; upper 97.5% CI: 0.15 mmol/L, non-inferiority margin: 0.19 mmol/L). 
The proportion of responders at week 12 was lower compared to sevelamer (44.8% PA21 versus 
54.7% sevelamer; OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.91) but comparable at week 24 (52.6% PA21 versus 
54.4% sevelamer) based on observed cases. 
Serum phosphorus lowering effects were comparable between relevant subgroups (HD and PD, 
patient’s ≥ 65 years of age).  
Within the long-term extension study, serum phosphorus levels and proportion of patients on KDOQI 
target were maintained between 6 and 12 months. 
The average number of tablets to be taken daily for PA21 was approximately half the number of 
tablets to be taken with sevelamer (between 4-5 tablets/day for PA21 and 9-12 tablets/day for 
sevelamer based on week 24 data). This remained stable within the extension period.   
For patients completing one year of follow-up, about 27% received a dose of ≤7.5 g/day (1,500 
mg/day iron), whereas 43% received the maximum dose of 15 g/day PA21 (3,000 mg/day iron). 
The outcome of the inspection confirmed that the data are acceptable to be used for the discussion on 
the benefit/risk. This was reassured by the results of additional sensitivity analyses on main efficacy 
endpoints excluding all Russian and Ukrainian sites.  
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 105/112 
 
  
  
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Assessment of the effect size during the 3 weeks withdrawal phase is hampered by inclusion of 
patients varying in KDOQI responder status and the use of a “placebo-dose” of PA21 which is still 
effective. This most likely results in an underestimation of the effect size, but the observed effect is 
still statistically significant supporting the serum phosphorus lowering effect of PA21. Further, the 
serum phosphorus lowering effect over time is considered of most important to demonstrate efficacy of 
PA21. Withdrawal rates during the active-controlled phase were higher for PA21 than for sevelamer, 
mainly due to a difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. As can be expected, discontinuations 
were lower and comparable between treatment groups during the extension phase of 6-12 months. 
Still, more patients discontinued on PA21 because of adverse events. 
The clinical relevance of the chosen non-inferiority margin is not known, however, the 10% difference 
in proportion of patients on target at week 12 in favour of sevelamer can be considered clinically 
relevant. Although the proportion of responders appears comparable at week 24, this is not supported 
by an intention-to-treat analyses suggesting that the proportion of responders remain lower for PA21 
than for sevelamer (about 7% at week 24). The long-term data are considered supportive for a 
comparable efficacy of PA21 to sevelamer based on mean serum phosphorus levels, although 
responder rates are somewhat lower. However, the difference as estimated based on the ITT analyses 
at week 24 is considered acceptable and almost half of the patients continued treatment on PA21 for 
one year which supports clinical relevant efficacy.  In terms of efficacy, a concern was raised on the 
reason for change in dialysis adequacy frequency as inclusion criterion; the Applicant explained that 
the initial weekly frequency was an error writing in the protocol and not representing normal clinical 
practice. This is acceptable. Additional sensitivity analyses on concomitant treatment potentially 
affecting serum phosphorus levels using a conservative approach confirmed the robustness of the 
efficacy results.    
The proposed starting dose of PA21 of 7.5 g/day was not studied in the phase 3 study. Phase 2 studies 
suggest a dose-response relationship. It can be anticipated that a higher starting dose of 7.5 g/day 
would at least result in similar efficacy and maybe somewhat higher efficacy or efficacy reached at an 
earlier time. In addition, there is a strong rationale for thrice daily dosing given that most patients will 
consume three meals/day and currently authorised phosphate binders are also given thrice daily. The 
rapid increase in dosing over time supports a higher starting dose.  
It is not known whether patients with higher baseline serum phosphorus levels would benefit from 
higher starting doses of PA21, as for sevelamer. However, post-hoc analyses suggest comparable 
efficacy in the long-term between PA21 and sevelamer independent of baseline serum phosphorus 
level. Although the majority of patients received the maximum daily dose at week 52 (about 40%), 
one quarter of patients on PA21 received a dose of ≤7.5 g/day (1,500 mg/day iron), which can be 
considered supportive for the starting dose of 7.5 g/day. Moreover, patients will be uptitrated based on 
serum phosphorus levels and there would be no unacceptable delay in treatment effect.   
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The most commonly reported TEAEs with PA21 were of gastrointestinal nature (42%) and of mild 
severity within the pooled phase 2/3 analysis up to 6 months. Most commonly reported treatment-
related TEAEs were diarrhoea and discoloured faeces. Diarrhoea was mostly mild and resolved with 
Assessment report  
EMA/567960/2014 
Page 106/112 
 
  
  
 
continued PA21. Gastrointestinal TEAEs were more common with PA21 compared with sevelamer (42% 
versus 33%). Serious TEAEs were reported at comparable frequencies between treatment groups 
(16.9% on PA21 and 19.0% on sevelamer) as were deaths (1.7% on PA21 and 1.9% on sevelamer). 
Withdrawal rates were higher in the PA21 group compared with sevelamer (29.3% versus 16.8%, 
respectively for the pooled safety analysis) and more often due to adverse events (16.9% versus 
7.8%, respectively for the pooled safety analysis).  
Similar trends were seen based on the integrated P-CL-05A/05B long term data, with the following 
results: For PA21, gastrointestinal TEAEs were reported in 52.5% of patients (versus 42.8% on 
sevelamer); serious TEAEs were reported in 26.6% of patients (versus 29.6% on sevelamer) and 
deaths were reported in 3.0% of patients (versus 4.0% on sevelamer). A contraindication was added 
in section 4.3 SmPC with haemochromatosis and any other iron accumulation disorders. 
Withdrawal rates were reported in 48.2% of patients (versus 35.0% on sevelamer) and 20.9% of 
withdrawals were due to adverse events (versus 10.3% on sevelamer). 
Serum ferritin and TSAT levels more rapidly increased on PA21 compared to sevelamer. TEAEs related 
to iron status parameters were reported in comparable rates between both treatment groups (about 
2% within the first 6 months and about 2.8% based on the integrated data up to one year). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No dose effect was observed but interpretation is difficult as only a minority of patients started 
treatment at different doses. Therefore it is uncertain whether the incidence of adverse events on the 
proposed starting dose of 7.5 g/day is currently underestimated.  
The integrated data including the long-term extension study contains safety data from about 335 
patients treated with at least 7.5 g/day PA21 (1,500 mg/day) for at least 6 months and 240 patients 
received the maximum dose of 15 g/day PA21 (3,000 mg/day) for a mean duration of 173 days. This 
is considered acceptable to establish the common safety profile for PA21. Although it cannot be 
excluded that TEAEs might be somewhat higher at the proposed starting dose of 7.5 g/day PA21, there 
are no signals that this would lead to major changes in frequencies. This is based on the current data 
using uptitrated doses, which show no signs of increased risk of TEAEs or new safety signals including 
doses twice as high as the proposed starting dose. Further, the most commonly reported adverse 
events are considered manageable. It was concluded that when the treatment is discontinued the 
patient can be switched to other available safe and effective phosphate binders.    
The frequency of adverse event reporting was consistently lower in the ROW compared to the US and 
EU, affecting about one third of the patient population included in the studies. The differences were 
less pronounced based on the extension study. The impact on the safety profile of PA21 is not known. 
The outcome of the GCP inspection is considered reassuring in this aspect as it confirmed that the data 
are acceptable for a discussion on the B/R based on the current database, which was confirmed by the 
additional analyses excluding Russian and Ukrainian sites. The differences in frequencies, but not in 
type, might be (partly) explained by differences in age, underlying disease severity and differences in 
culture in reporting AEs. This is acceptable also given that no issues on validity of data remained.   
Further, regarding the cause of the tumours/lesions, an association with particle uptake in the gut wall 
could not be excluded, as it was uncertain whether Perl’s staining would be capable of detecting iron, 
present in the form of intact particles. A re-assessment of the carcinogenicity data from the mouse 
study was conducted by an ad-hoc Pathology Working Group. With their response to the CHMP Day 
180 LoOI, the Applicant provided sufficient information to exclude a significant uptake of iron (-
particle) and supports the absence of a tumorigenic response in mice or rats related to PA21. Sufficient 
Assessment report

Page 107/112 
 
  
  
information was provided to show that Perls’ staining is capable of detecting iron as a particle, and the 
lack of correlation between positive Perls’ staining and presence of colon hyperplasia or lesions provide 
reassurance that effects in the colon of mice are not the result of iron(particle) accumulation in the 
intestinal wall. 
It is unclear whether iron accumulation will increase over time and could eventually result in clinically 
relevant adverse events. Absolute iron absorption is not negligible and non-clinical and PK studies 
indicate that there is a potential for accumulation of absorbed iron or particle. Preclinical data are 
reassuring considering the initial concern on inert particle accumulation as it appears that iron 
absorption occurs most likely in biodegradable form. Clinical data up to one year do not indicate 
cumulative iron accumulation and the absolute amount absorbed is limited compared to the amount of 
iron that patients receive trough iv treatment. This means that regular monitoring of iron storage 
parameters can suffice in combination with the follow-up post-approval of iron-related adverse events. 
Few patients experienced serious gastrointestinal events (2.3% on PA21 compared to 1.6% on 
sevelamer) within 6 months of follow-up and were slightly higher based on the long-term integrated 
data (3.7% in both treatment groups). No serious events except one case of faeces discolouring and 
one case of duodenal ulcer bleeding was considered related to PA21 after 6 months of treatment an 
additional case of gastric disorder and upper GI haemorrhage were considered treatment-related. As 
patients with a wide variety of gastrointestinal disorders were excluded from the studies, it is not 
known whether certain patients might be more vulnerable to (serious) gastrointestinal events when 
treated with PA21. The B/R should be carefully assessed before treating these patients with PA21 and 
attention should be paid to AEs in these patients during follow-up post approval.  
It is uncertain how the abnormal product taste experienced by part of the patients (about 3%) might 
affect patient’s compliance with PA21 in daily clinical practice. Few patients reported lower compliance 
rates, however, compliance in daily clinical practice is difficult to predict from clinical trial data. 
Abnormal product taste is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
In vivo drug-drug interactions did not reveal significant interactions with losartan, furosemide, digoxin, 
warfarin, and omeprazole. The interaction potential seems low; however it remains questionable to 
which extent the in vitro interactions showing lack of interference can be extrapolated to in vivo. This 
may especially of concern with narrow therapeutic drugs. The section 4.5 of the SmPC sufficiently 
addresses these aspects. The limited number of patients on PD precludes a meaningful interpretation 
of the safety profile and this need to be followed-up post-approval (missing information RMP). 
Benefit-Risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
PA21 has demonstrated clinically significant reductions in serum phosphorus levels in patients on 
maintenance dialysis. These levels were maintained throughout the treatment period of 6 months. In 
patients tolerating PA21, efficacy based on serum phosphorus levels was maintained in the period of 6 
to 12 months and comparable to sevelamer. Almost half of the population continued on treatment for 
one year. Clinically relevant efficacy was shown in patients on HD and PD, although the latter formed a 
minority of the total population. 
Almost half of the treated population reached target serum phosphorus levels in line with treatment 
guidelines. This is of clinical relevance as higher serum phosphorus levels are associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality. The proportions reaching target serum phosphorus levels with PA21 were 
lower compared to sevelamer at week 12, but appeared comparable at week 24 and responder rates

EMA/567960/2014

were maintained up to one year. 
Withdrawal rates were also higher for PA21 compared to sevelamer, mainly due to adverse events and 
to a lower extent due to lack of efficacy.   
Average daily tablet intake with PA21 was about half that of sevelamer, it can be assumed that this 
might favour treatment compliance.  
The safety profile of PA21 is characterised by gastrointestinal events which were seen at higher rates 
than with sevelamer. More patients on PA21 also discontinued treatment due to adverse events 
compared to sevelamer, indicating a poorer tolerability of PA21, which might implicate  lower 
compliance in clinical practice.  
No signs of increased numbers of serious adverse events related to PA21 were seen in the clinical 
studies. Treatment up to one year did not raise new safety signals. 
Absolute iron absorption is not negligible and non-clinical and PK studies indicate that there is a 
potential for accumulation of absorbed iron, most likely in the biodegradable form. Intestinal lesions 
observed in the non-clinical setting most likely relate to the bulky nature of the substance, the 
relevance for humans needs post-approval follow-up. Potential iron accumulation in predisposed 
patient population is included as important potential risk in the RMP. There are no indications of 
carcinogenicity related to PA21. Treatment up to one year in humans did not show signs of iron 
accumulation due to PA21 or an increase in iron-related adverse events. Potential iron absorption from 
PA21 is low compared to the amount of iron patients receive through iv iron infusion which is common 
with the population. 
The outcome of the inspection confirmed that the data is acceptable to be used for the discussion on 
the benefit/risk. This was reassured by the results of additional sensitivity analyses on main efficacy 
endpoints excluding all Russian and Ukrainian sites.  
The concerns raised by the four anonymous letters were carefully assessed and commented upon by 
the CHMP, some of the concerns were referred to in the questions raised during the evaluation 
procedure and successfully addressed by the Applicant.  
Benefit-risk balance 
PA21 shows a clear beneficial effect in terms of serum phosphorus lowering in patients on maintenance 
dialyses with an acceptable safety profile based on data up to one year. Although it cannot be excluded 
that the phosphorus lowering effect and the tolerability is somewhat less than the currently available 
phosphate binders (sevelamer), long-term efficacy appears comparable in patients tolerating PA21.  
Patients with a recent history of peritonitis (within the last 3 months), significant gastric or hepatic 
disorders and patients with major gastrointestinal surgery have not been included in clinical studies 
with Velphoro. Velphoro should only be used in these patients following careful assessment of 
benefit/risk. Velphoro contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, 
glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
Velphoro can cause discoloured (black) stool. Discoloured (black) stool may visually mask 
gastrointestinal bleeding. 
The potential iron absorption appears limited and not associated with toxicity based on preclinical data 
and currently available human data up to one year, and does not preclude a positive B/R.  
The benefit risk balance in the proposed indication is considered positive.

Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
All patients with CKD Stage 5 will (in the end) need phosphate binders to reduce their serum 
phosphorus levels.  
One phase 3 clinical study has been performed in patients with CKD on dialysis to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of Velphoro in this population. This study was an open-label, randomised, 
active-controlled (sevelamer carbonate), parallel group study for up to 55 weeks. Adult patients with 
hyperphosphataemia (serum phosphorus levels ≥1.94 mmol/L) were treated with Velphoro at a 
starting dose of 1,000 mg iron/day followed by an 8-week dose titration period. Non-inferiority to 
sevelamer carbonate was determined at week 12. Subjects were continued on their study medication 
from week 12 to week 55. From week 12 to 24, dose titrations were allowed for both tolerability and 
efficacy reasons. Treatment of patient sub-populations from week 24 to week 27 with maintenance 
dose of Velphoro (1,000 to 3,000 mg iron/day) or low dose (250 mg iron/day) of Velphoro 
demonstrated superiority of the maintenance dose. 
In Study-05A, 1,055 patients on hemodialysis (N=968) or peritoneal dialysis (N=87) with serum 
phosphorus ≥1.94 mmol/L following a 2-4 week phosphate binder washout period, were randomized 
and treated with either Velphoro, at a starting dose of 1,000 mg/day (N=707), or active-control 
(sevelamer carbonate, N=348) for 24 weeks. At the end of week 24, 93 patients on hemodialysis 
whose serum phosphorus levels were controlled (<1.78 mmol/L) with Velphoro in the first part of the 
study, were re-randomized to continue treatment with either their week 24 maintenance dose (N=44 
or a non-effective low dose control 250 mg/day, N=49) of Velphoro for a further 3 weeks. 
Following completion of Study-05A, 658 patients (597 on hemodialysis and 61 on peritoneal dialysis) 
were treated in the 28-week extension study (Study-05B) with either Velphoro (N=391) or sevelamer 
carbonate (N=267) according to their original randomization. 
Mean serum phosphorus levels were 2.5 mmol/L at baseline and 1.8 mmol/L at week 12 for Velphoro 
(reduction by 0.7 mmol/L). Corresponding levels for sevelamer carbonate at baseline were 2.4 mmol/L 
and 1.7 mmol/L at week 12 (reduction by 0.7 mmol/L), respectively.  
The serum phosphorus reduction was maintained over 55 weeks. Serum phosphorus levels and 
calcium-phosphorus product levels were reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate 
absorption. The response rates, defined as the proportion of subjects achieving serum phosphorus 
levels within the KDOQI recommended range were 45.3% and 59.1% at week 12 and 51.9% and 
55.2% at week 52, for Velphoro and sevelamer carbonate, respectively. 
The mean daily dose of Velphoro over 55 weeks of treatment was 1,650 mg iron and the mean daily 
dose of sevelamer carbonate was 6,960 mg.  
The gastrointestinal safety profile largely resembles that of sevelamer, with diarrhoea being 
predominant with PA21 and constipation more often seen with sevelamer.   
There is a strong rational for a starting dose of 7.5 g/day, (three tablets per day) allowing treatment 
with each meal, as the tablet need to be taken with food. Other available phosphate binders are also 
administered thrice daily and most of the patients had their dose increased early during treatment 
within the clinical trial. It can be anticipated that efficacy will at least be similar to that seen with the 
current starting dose.  
Tolerability of PA21 is less than for sevelamer and more often leads to withdrawal. Still, over half of 
patients on PA21 were included in the long-term extension study and almost half continued treatment 
for one year with doses up to 15.0 g/day. It cannot be excluded that comparison with sevelamer is 
partly biased by the fact that about one third of patients were on sevelamer prior to start of the study, 
which most likely are patients tolerating sevelamer. Moreover, adverse events most commonly

Page 110/112 
 
  
  
reported including diarrhoea were mostly mild and are considered manageable. Patients discontinuing 
treatment can be switched to other available phosphate binders. 
One year data did not show an increased risk of iron accumulation or adverse events related to iron 
parameters. The amount of iron potentially absorbed from PA21 is low compared to the iron 
administered iv as part of the treatment regimen for CKD dialysis patients. As iron status parameters 
are monitored regularly, any potential increased would be noticed and considered manageable by 
stopping the drug or changes to the iv iron treatment. The risk of iron accumulation in a broader 
population should be followed up post approval in the PASS and as part of the RMP and PSURs.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Velphoro in the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) patients on haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD), is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the non-clinical and clinical properties of the active substance, 
the CHMP considers that mixture of polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide, sucrose and starches  which is 
a complex of iron (III)- oxyhydroxide is qualified as a new active substance. The physical properties in 
vivo of the iron active moieties in the registered iron parental products differ from the physical 
properties in vivo of the active substance, and as a consequence the efficacy/safety profile is different 
and therefore it is agreed the compound is a new active substance.

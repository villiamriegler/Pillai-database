2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Travoprost  belongs  to  the  pharmacological  class  of  PGF2α  (prostaglandin  F2α  receptor)  agonists  that 
includes latanoprost (Xalatan), bimatoprost (Lumigan) and tafluprost (Taflotan). Prostaglandin analogues 
have  been  shown  to  lower  intraocular  pressure  (IOP)  by  increasing  the  outflow  of  aqueous  humour  via 
trabecular  meshwork  and  uveoscleral  pathways.  They  are currently  the  most  widely  prescribed  first-line 
ocular  hypotensive  agents  in  most  developed  countries  because  of  their  IOP-lowering  efficacy  and 
established safety. 
Travoprost  40  µg/mL  eye  drops,  solution  preserved  with  benzalkonium  chloride  (BAK)  received  EU 
marketing  authorisation  in  November  2001  (EU/1/01/199/001-002).  Travoprost  40  µg/mL  solution 
preserved with polyquaternium-1 (PQ) was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in November 
2010  (EMEA/H/C/II/0035G).  Another  Travoprost  40  µg/mL  solution  preserved  with  SofZia  (a  zinc-based 
preservative system) was approved in the USA in September 2006 (NDA 21-994), and also is marketed in 
Canada  and  Japan.    In  addition,  Alcon  recently  developed  a  PQ-preserved  formulation  that  contains 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 6/39 
 
  
  
 
travoprost 30  µg/mL  (Travoprost  0.003%,  Solution)  which  was  approved  in  the  EU  on  the  20  Feb  2014 
(EMEA/H/C/002738/0000).  
Travoprost 40 µg/mL solution is indicated for the decrease of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients 
with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The current type II variation application submitted by the 
MAH (Marketing Authorisation Holder) is to extend the currently authorised indication to include paediatric 
patients from 2 months to <18 years of age at the same posology as in adults.  
Glaucoma in infancy and childhood is a potentially blinding condition characterized by elevated intraocular 
pressure. Increased IOP leads to optic nerve damage and consequent visual loss. Additional damage to the 
visual system, including large refractive error, strabismus and amblyopia, may occur. Overall, glaucoma is 
responsible for 5% of blindness in children worldwide. Early diagnosis and referral are crucial to ensuring 
optimal visual outcome.  
Paediatric  glaucoma  is  classified  into  primary  and  secondary  types.  Primary  glaucomas  are  those  with 
isolated angle malformations. Primary glaucoma may have onset at birth, in the first few years of life, or 
later in life (congenital, primary infantile, and juvenile glaucoma, respectively).  
The goal of infantile glaucoma therapy is preservation of vision rather than control of IOP, although IOP is 
used to monitor treatment success. Depending on the degree of angle dysgenesis and angle abnormalities 
in children with primary glaucoma, surgery is the mainstay of treatment, although initial therapy for aphakic 
glaucoma and JOAG (juvenile open angle glaucoma) is usually pharmacological.  
Many children may require pharmacological management either as a long-term treatment or as temporizing 
measures before and/or after surgical intervention. Medications used in the treatment of glaucoma include 
beta-blockers,  alpha-2-adrenergic  agonists,  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors,  prostaglandin  analogues, 
miotics,  and  sympathomimetics.  The  data  supporting  the  use  of  these  medicinal  products  in  paediatric 
population are scarce. 
The  clinical  development  plan  of  Travoprost  40  µg/mL  solution  dosed  once  daily  for  the  indication  of 
decrease  of  elevated  intraocular  pressure  in  paediatric  patients  with  glaucoma  or  ocular  hypertension 
consists of 2 clinical studies including, 1 safety and pharmacokinetic study (C-12-009) and 1 Phase 3 safety 
and  efficacy  study  (C-12-008).  These  studies  are  used  to  support  this  application  for  the  indication  of 
decrease in elevated IOP in paediatric patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  
Both studies were agreed with the EMA Paediatric Committee (PDCO) in a formal Paediatric Investigation 
Plan  (EMEA-001271-PIP01-12-M01).  This  variation  application  has  been  subject  to  a  PIP  compliance 
verification by the PDCO which agreed that the conducted studies were fully compliant with the agreed PIP.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
To support the addition of paediatric indications for Travoprost, a justification statement concerning 
Environmental Risk Assessment was provided by the MAH. 
The paediatric use follows identical posology, administered via the same route of administration and using 
the same product concentration as in adults. The MAH stated that the addition of the new paediatric 
population is not likely to cause a significant increase of the overall Predicted Environmental Concentration 
(PEC) in the environment. 
However, the results of the persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) screening test (LogKow 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 7/39 
 
  
  
determined experimentally by slow-stirring method) need to be submitted. Furthermore, if the value 
obtained for the product would be higher than 4.5, Travoprost should be screened by the Applicant in a 
step-wise procedure for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. The CHMP recommended that an updated 
ERA is submitted. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data have been submitted in this 
application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
For Environmental Risk Assessment, the MAH has submitted a justification for not performing ERA studies, 
as it does not expect a significant increase in Predicted Environmental Exposure deriving from this paediatric 
extension. The justification provided by the MAH is generally agreed upon.  However, the CHMP 
recommended the MAH to conduct PBT screening test (LogKow study) and submit the results and an 
updated ERA accordingly.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of Travoprost. However, the CHMP recommends that an updated ERA with the 
results of PBT study is submitted.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The systemic pharmacokinetics of travoprost free acid (AL-5848) following topical ocular administration of 
Travoprost 0.004% eye drops, solution has been characterized in multiple studies in adult populations.  
In addition, a paediatric pharmacokinetic study (Study C-12-009) was conducted as part of the Paediatric 
Investigation Plan to compare systemic AL-5848 exposure in paediatric patients to historical data in adults.  
•  Study C-12-009  
This was a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study. The primary objectives of this study were to assess the 
safety and evaluate the steady-state plasma concentrations of AL-5848 following once daily administration 
of Travoprost 0.004% PQ in paediatric patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  
Methods 
Patients aged 2 months to less than 18 years of age who had a diagnosis of glaucoma or ocular hypertension 
in at least 1 eye were enrolled. Patients with conditions requiring chronic treatment with glucocorticosteroids 
resulting in steroid-induced glaucoma and aphakic patients with contact lenses were also eligible for 
enrolment. A minimum of 3 patients were planned for enrolment in each of the following age subgroups: 2 
months to < 3 years, 3 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years. 
Patients received Travoprost 0.004% PQ instilled as 1 drop in each eye once daily at 9 AM (± 60 minutes) for 
7 days. Patients were evaluated for safety at Day 1 and Day 7. In addition, during the Day 7 visit, patients 
underwent PK plasma sampling within 30 minutes prior to instillation of the final dose of study drug and at 
various time points (10, 20, 40, and 80 minutes) post-dose.  
Criteria for Evaluation were as follows: 
 
Pharmacokinetic: Cmax, Tmax, Tlast, AUC0-last, AUC0-∞, t 1/2  
  Safety: Adverse events, vital signs, alertness evaluations, ECG, slit-lamp examination, ocular 
hyperemia, intraocular pressure, best corrected visual acuity, dilated fundus examination 
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, geometric mean, standard deviation, number, minimum, and 
maximum values) were provided for plasma concentration levels at each sampling time and for all estimated 
PK parameters. Scatter plots of concentration versus time and peak plasma concentration versus weight 
were also generated.

Results 
Overall, 25 patients were enrolled into and completed the study. A total of 24 of the 25 patients were 
included in the PK analysis set. The mean age of the patients in the PK analysis set was 9.6 years: 2 months 
to <3 years (N = 4); 3 to <12 years (N = 9); 12 to <18 years (N = 11). 50% of the patients were male and 
50% of the patients were White; a substantial percentage of the patients were Black/African American 
(45.8%). There were no relevant demographic differences among patients included in both the PK and 
safety analysis sets. 
Pharmacokinetic Results: 
A total of 25 patients were dosed. Of the 24 patients included in the PK analysis set, 11 had at least 1 sample 
with quantifiable AL-5848 concentrations (≥  0.0100 ng/mL); 5 of these patients had 2 quantifiable samples, 
and 1 patient had quantifiable drug levels at all 4 post-dose time points. Of the 119 study samples analysed, 
only 19 (16.4%) had quantifiable drug concentrations.  
Cmax was achieved at 10 minutes post-dose in 8 of the 11 patients with quantifiable data. Two other 
patients had maximum exposures at 20 minutes, and 1 patient had a maximum exposure at 40 minutes. All 
Day 7 pre-dose trough samples were BLQ (below the limit of quantitation), indicating no accumulation of 
AL-5848 in plasma over the course of treatment. 
AL-5848 plasma concentrations ranged from BLQ to 0.0545 ng/mL. This range was similar to that found in 
4 previous PK studies in various adult populations. 
No clear relationship between age or body surface area (BSA) was apparent. While the highest individual  
AL- 5848 concentration in the study (0.0545 ng/mL) was observed in the youngest patient (aged 3 months) 
with the lowest BSA (0.366 m2), 2 other patients in the less than 3 years age cohort did not show any 
quantifiable AL-5848 exposure. In addition, the highest AUC0-last value (0.0303 ng*hr/mL) was observed in 
a 6 year old patient (BSA = 0.837 m2). 
Historical data in adults 
The exposure data in paediatric patients were compared with historical data in four studies in adult 
populations including healthy volunteers, renally-impaired subjects, hepatically-impaired subjects and 
healthy male Japanese volunteers. Of the 107 patients in these 4 adult studies, nearly two-thirds (68 of 107) 
had no quantifiable AL-5848 plasma concentrations. The mean Cmax for the 60 adult PK profiles with 
quantifiable AL-5848 concentrations was 0.0180 ± 0.007 ng/mL and the quantifiable concentrations ranged 
from 0.0100 to 0.0520 ng/mL.  
The range of quantifiable AL-5848 exposure in the 4 adult populations was 10.0 to 52.0 pg/mL, similar to 
that observed in paediatric patients. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No additional pharmacodynamic studies in children have been conducted.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of travoprost in adults have been characterised and reported previously in the 
Marketing Authorisation Application for Travatan 40 µg/mL eye drops solution. The MAH has performed one 
PK study to evaluate the steady-state systemic exposure of travoprost in paediatric patients with glaucoma 
or ocular hypertension.  Patients were administered the usual adult dose of travoprost.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 10/39 
 
  
  
Only paediatric patients were included in the trial so that the comparison with adult parameters is based on 
historical data. Of note, paediatric patients received travoprost solution preserved with polyquad 
(Travoprost 0.004% PQ). Travatan formulation was modified in 2010 in order to replace the preservative 
used benzalkonium chloride (BAK) by polyquaternium-1 (POLYQUAD, PQ).  The reference data for adults 
were obtained with Travoprost 0.004% preserved with BAK. However, as the bioequivalence between 
Travoprost 0.004% BAK and PQ formulations was already demonstrated, Travoprost 0.004% BAK has been 
considered to be acceptable as reference.  
Whereas the optimal effect is obtained if the product is administered in the evening, the treatment was 
scheduled to be administered in the morning. It is considered that it was due to feasibility reasons and 
although it could have some relevance for the IOP lowering effect it has no significant impact on the 
travoprost pharmacokinetics.  
 Peak concentrations ranged from 0.0105 to 0.0545 ng/mL, plasma levels being higher in younger patients. 
Although a potentially relevant systemic exposure in the youngest group of patients cannot be excluded, no 
signs of accumulation have been seen in any group and in general the measured exposure is similar to that 
reported  for  adults.    No  relevant  findings  were  observed  in  terms  of  safety in  comparison  to  adults  and 
between the different groups of paediatric patients. However, the limited number of patients in each group 
and the wide inter-subject variability do not allow reaching full conclusions. 
Since the safety profile is consistent with that already known for adults (no new signals associated with 
exposure),  it  is  a  topically  administered  medicine  and  no  signs  of  accumulation  were  seen,  no  further 
concerns have been raised.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has performed one PK study in paediatric patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Following 
once daily topical ocular administration for 7 days the systemic exposure to AL-5848 was low. In most of 
patients plasma levels were undetectable (below 0.0100 ng/mL assay quantifiable concentration). Only a 
minority of samples analysed (16.4%) showed measurable concentrations.  
After analysis of the PK data obtained from the Study C-12-009 and data from adult PK studies, no dose 
adjustment  has  been  recommended  by  age  for  the  phase  3  study.  This  is  consistent  with  the 
recommendations for other prostaglandin F2α agonist eye drops used in paediatric population.  
The pharmacodynamics of Travoprost have been adequately characterised in adults and the pertinent data 
are appropriately reflected in the currently approved harmonized SmPC for Travoprost. Additional studies in 
children are not considered necessary.   
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
One single clinical trial has been submitted to support the efficacy of travoprost in the paediatric population. 
This study was designed to establish comparability (non inferiority) between Travoprost 0.004% PQ and 
Timolol in the reduction of IOP in paediatric patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study C-12-008 - A 3 Month, Multicenter, Double-Masked Safety and Efficacy Study of Travoprost 
Ophthalmic Solution, 0.004% Compared to Timolol (0.5% or 0.25%) in Paediatric Glaucoma Patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 11/39 
 
  
  
Methods 
This  was  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-masked,  parallel-group,  active-controlled  study  intended  to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of Travoprost 0.004% PQ in paediatric patients with glaucoma or ocular 
hypertension. 
The study was designed to demonstrate that the IOP-lowering efficacy of Travoprost 0.004% PolyQuad was 
noninferior to Timolol 0.5% (0.25% for patients < 3 years of age) in paediatric patients with glaucoma or 
ocular hypertension. The primary efficacy endpoint was IOP change from baseline at Month 3.  
Following the Screening and Eligibility visits, eligible patients were randomized to receive either Travoprost 
0.004% PQ once daily in each eye in the evening (with Travoprost Vehicle instilled once daily in the morning 
to maintain masking) or Timolol twice daily in each eye (once in the morning and once in the evening); the 
assigned study drugs were instilled as 1 drop in each eye for 3 months. Patients were evaluated for safety 
and efficacy at Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3. 
At the assessment visits, IOP was measured in both eyes at 9 AM (± 60 minutes) at all study visits using a 
calibrated  tonometer  (Goldmann  or  Perkins  instrument  was  preferred,  although  a  Tono-Pen®  was 
acceptable)  and  a  combination  of  a  topical  anesthetic  and  a  coloring  agent.  The  same  2  individuals  (an 
operator and a reader) measured IOP for a given patient at all study visits and the same method (including 
the same fluorescein and anesthetic agent) for measuring IOP should have been used for each individual 
patient at all study visits whenever possible. Two consecutive IOP measurements were taken for each eye at 
every assessment. 
Study participants 
The study population included males and females of any race/ethnicity who were 2 months to less than 18 
years of age, and who had a diagnosis of paediatric glaucoma or ocular hypertension, including patients with 
conditions requiring chronic treatment with glucocorticosteroids resulting in steroid-induced glaucoma; 
aphakic patients who wore contact lenses were also eligible for enrolment. The mean IOP measurement in at 
least 1 eye must have been greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at the 9 AM (± 60 minutes) time point at the 
Eligibility visit. 
Eligible patients must not have had recent histories of chronic, recurrent, or severe inflammatory eye 
disease, ocular trauma, intraocular surgery, clinically significant or progressive retinal disease, other severe 
ocular pathologies (eg, dry eye), any abnormality preventing reliable tonometry, or current signs and 
symptoms that were associated with these or other ocular and non ocular conditions.  
Patients were stratified by primary diagnosis (primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), or non-PCG, including 
secondary glaucomas and juvenile open-angle glaucoma [JOAG]) and baseline IOP in the study eye (< 27, 
27–31, and > 31 mmHg). 
Treatments 
Eligible patients were randomized to receive either Travoprost 0.004% PQ once daily in each eye in the 
evening (with Travoprost Vehicle instilled once daily in the morning to maintain masking) or Timolol 0.5%

noninferior to Timolol 5 mg/mL, eye drops solution (2.5 mg/mL for patients < 3 years of age) (Timolol) in 
paediatric patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was: 
• 
IOP change from baseline at Month 3 
The supportive efficacy endpoints were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
IOP change from baseline at Week 2 and Week 6 
IOP and IOP percent change from baseline at each visit (Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3) 
Percentage of patients who achieved at least a 15% reduction in IOP at each visit (Week 2, Week 6, 
and Month 3) 
Percentage of patients who achieved IOP within the normal range 
Safety: 
• 
Extent of exposure 
•  Adverse events (AEs) 
•  Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature) 
•  Alertness evaluations (responsiveness, speech, facial expression, and eyes) 
•  Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 
•  Slit-lamp examination of eyelids and conjunctiva, cornea, lens, and iris/anterior chamber, including 
the presence of aqueous flare and inflammatory cells 
•  Automated perimetry 
•  Central corneal thickness 
•  Corneal diameter 
•  Ocular hyperemia 
•  Dilated fundus examinations (vitreous, retina/macula/choroid, optic nerve, and measurements of 
cup/disc ratio) 
•  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters 
Sample size 
With 65 patients per group with a Month 3 endpoint in the ITT analysis, there is approximately 90% power 
to demonstrate that Travoprost 0.004% PQ is noninferior to Timolol using a noninferiority margin of + 3.0 
mmHg, ie, that the upper limit of the 95% 2-sided CI for the difference in IOP change (Travoprost 0.004% 
PQ group minus Timolol group) is less than the noninferiority margin. Assuming a 10% dropout rate due to 
the  initiation  of  open-label  concomitant  therapy  or  losses  to  follow-up,  the  resultant  sample  size  of 
approximately  58  patients  per  group  would  provide  approximately  87%  power  to  demonstrate 
noninferiority. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 13/39 
 
  
  
In addition to the noninferiority margin, the sample size estimate further assumed an SD for IOP change of 
7 mmHg, a 5% chance of a Type I error, and that the mean IOP change for the Travoprost 0.004% PQ group 
would be at least 1 mmHg better than the Timolol group. 
Randomisation 
Patients  who  satisfied  the  eligibility  criteria  were  randomized  (1:1),  using  an  interactive  web  response 
system  (IWRS),  to  1  of  2  study  treatment  groups:  Travoprost  0.004%  PQ  or  Timolol.  A  centralized 
randomization scheme was implemented, and randomization was at the study level, stratified by primary 
diagnosis  (primary  congenital  glaucoma  [PCG],  or  non-  PCG,  including  secondary  glaucomas,  juvenile 
open-angle glaucoma [JOAG]) and ocular hypertension and baseline IOP in the study eye (< 27, 27–31, and 
> 31 mmHg). 
Masking 
The patients (or their parents/legal guardians) were dispensed study medication along with instructions to 
instill 1 drop of study medication in each eye from the bottle labeled “morning” at 9 AM (± 30 minutes) and 
1 drop of study medication in each eye from the bottle labeled “evening” at 9 PM (± 30 minutes) through the 
day prior to the Month 3/Exit visit. In order to maintain the masking, patients in the Travoprost 0.004% PQ 
group instilled Vehicle in the morning and Travoprost 0.004% PQ in the evening each day, while patients in 
the Timolol group instilled Timolol once in the morning and again in the evening each day; thus, patients in 
both groups instilled study medication twice daily. 
Statistical methods 
The efficacy parameters were evaluated using the ITT and PP analysis sets. The ITT analysis set included all 
patients who received study drug and completed at least 1 scheduled on-therapy visit; the PP analysis set 
included all patients who received study drug, satisfied prerandomization inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 
completed at least 1 scheduled on-therapy study visit. Safety was evaluated using the safety analysis set, 
which included all patients who received study drug. 
In order to provide a robust evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint, the results obtained using both the 
PP and ITT analysis sets were considered jointly when evaluating whether the study successfully 
demonstrated non inferiority. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Treatment differences in mean IOP change from baseline were examined with a pairwise test at the Month 
3 visit. The pairwise test was based on the least squares means derived from an analysis of covariance with 
treatment and primary diagnosis as factors and baseline IOP as a covariate in the model. The IOP change 
was calculated as IOP at Month 3 minus IOP at baseline. Thus, within-group efficacy was evidenced by more 
negative values of IOP change. For the test of noninferiority, a 95% 2-sided confidence interval (CI) was 
constructed for the difference in the mean change from baseline in IOP between treatment groups at Month 
3. The test for demonstrating noninferiority was based on a margin of + 3.0 mmHg. Thus, noninferiority was 
established if the upper limit of the differences in mean IOP change from baseline between treatment groups 
(ie, the mean IOP change from baseline in the Travoprost 0.004% PQ group minus the mean IOP change 
from baseline in the Timolol group) was less than + 3.0 mmHg at the Month 3 visit. 
If noninferiority was achieved, then superiority was to be tested at an alpha level of 0.05. Superiority would 
be concluded if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in IOP change (ie, the mean IOP 
change from baseline in the Travoprost 0.004% PQ group minus the mean IOP change from baseline in the 
Timolol group) was less than 0 mmHg at the Month 3 visit.

The primary efficacy endpoint was also summarized descriptively according to the primary diagnosis 
(primary congenital glaucoma, non primary congenital glaucoma, including secondary glaucomas and 
juvenile open-angle glaucoma).

Recruitment 
Patients  in  this  study  were  enrolled  across  38  investigational  centres  in  the  United  States,  Germany, 
Singapore, United Kingdom, Taiwan, Philippines, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Columbia, France, Portugal, Belgium, 
Poland, Romania, Puerto Rico, and Mexico.  
Study Period: 05 September 2012 to 25 March 2014 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended three times. Some of the important changes that were made include: 
• 
The patient population was divided into 2 cohorts defined by age: Cohort 1 included patients 3 to < 
18 years of age and Cohort 2 included patients 2 months to < 3 years of age. Enrolment was planned 
to begin with Cohort 1, while Cohort 2 was opened for enrolment once pharmacokinetic data were 
available in patients < 3 years of age. 
•  A minimum IOP entrance criterion of at least 20 mmHg in 1 eye at the Eligibility visit was added

• 
The statistical analyses were updated to clarify that a test of superiority would be performed on the 
primary  endpoint  if  noninferiority  was  first  met  (based  on  CPMP/EWP/482/99)  and  to  include  a 
descriptive supportive analysis of the percentage of patients who reached an IOP within a normal 
range. 
•  Changes to the efficacy analysis plan for clarification and to address concerns over bias arising from 
regression to mean among the small  number of patients diagnosed with ocular hypertension for 
whom a sustained increase in IOP could not be documented.  
Patient disposition 
Overall, 152 patients were randomized to study drug, including 77 patients in the Travoprost 0.004% PQ 
group and 75 patients in the Timolol group. Across treatment groups, 95.4% of the patients (145 of 152 
patients) completed the study. All 152 randomized patients were included in the ITT and safety analysis 
sets. One patient in the Travoprost 0.004% PQ group was excluded from the PP analysis set due to a 
violation of the inclusion criteria. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Within the ITT analysis set, the greatest proportion of patients was 3 to less than 12 years of age (52.0%; 
overall mean age = 9.6 years), female (52.6%), and White (40.8%). Substantial proportion of patients were 
also Black or African American (19.7%), Asian (12.5%), or other (26.3%). The patients were generally 
diagnosed with non-paediatric congenital glaucoma (70.4%). These patients were most commonly classified 
as having ocular hypertension (17.8%), juvenile open-angle glaucoma (17.1%), or glaucoma following 
lensectomy for congenital cataracts (11.8%). Overall, most of the randomized patients had a baseline IOP 
< 27 mmHg (77.0%). There were no clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups in regard 
to any of the demographic parameters or baseline characteristics.  
Efficacy results 
For the primary efficacy endpoint using the PP analysis set, the least squares mean (standard error [SE]) 
reduction in IOP was 6.4 (1.05) mmHg in the Travoprost 0.004% PQ group and 5.8 (0.96) mmHg in the 
Timolol group (Table 2-1). The least squares mean difference between treatment groups was −0.5 mmHg 
(95% CI: −2.1, 1.0 mmHg).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 16/39 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The results obtained using the ITT analysis set were consistent with those obtained using the PP analysis set. 
Specifically, the mean (SE) reduction in IOP was 5.4 (0.98) mmHg in the Travoprost 0.004% PQ group and 
5.3 (0.93) mmHg in the Timolol group (Table 2-2). The least squares mean difference between treatment 
groups was −0.1 mmHg (95% CI: −1.5, 1.4 mmHg).  
In this study, the prespecified non inferiority margin was 3.0 mmHg. Thus, the study met its objective and 
demonstrated that Travoprost 0.004% PQ is non inferior to Timolol. The results did not support a conclusion 
of superiority as the upper limit of the 95% CIs did not lie entirely below 0. 
Sensitivity analyses were planned using the PP and ITT analysis sets for mean IOP change from baseline to 
Month 3 to evaluate the potential for bias resulting from the inclusion of patients with ocular hypertension. 
The results obtained in Sensitivity Analysis 1 were nearly identical to the results obtained using the full PP 
and ITT analysis sets, indicating that the study results were not biased by the inclusion of patients who did 
not have a confirmed history of sustained IOP elevation. The results obtained in Sensitivity Analysis 2 were 
similar to the results obtained using the full PP and ITT analysis sets, indicating that the study results were 
not biased by the inclusion of patients with ocular hypertension. 
The supportive efficacy endpoints were consistent with the primary efficacy conclusion of non inferiority. The 
mean IOP measurements were similar in the Travoprost 0.004% PQ and Timolol groups at each study visit 
at Week 2, Week 6 and Month 3. The percentage of patients who achieved at least a 15% reduction in IOP 
was similar in the Travoprost 0.004% PQ (83.1%) and Timolol groups (74.3%). Finally, the percentage of 
patients who achieved an IOP measurement within the normal range was somewhat greater at all study 
visits in the Travoprost 0.004% PQ group (71.8%) than in the Timolol group (66.2%). 
The youngest cohort in the study (2 months to < 3 years of age) included 16 patients. 10 patients were 
randomized to the Travoprost arm and 6 received timolol. The IOP measurements of all the patients in this 
group at the study visits are provided below in Table 4-1.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The overall design of the clinical study (including the selection criteria of the patients, the duration of the 
study, the choice of endpoints) have been discussed with the PDCO and are in agreement with other clinical 
trials in this field.  
Patients 2 months to < 18 years of age with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were included.  
A randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, active-controlled study is an acceptable study design. The 
absence of placebo arm can be justified as it would be considered unacceptable to include a placebo arm in 
paediatric patients when suitable treatment options are available. Moreover from published literature the 
IOP-lowering efficacy of timolol is established and hence a comparative study of Travoprost and timolol is 
acceptable.  
The MAH has chosen to demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety of children as compared to timolol, when 
the results from this study is taken in to consideration along with the efficacy and safety data of travoprost 
in adults. The sample size was estimated based on a non-inferiority margin of 3 mm Hg and the assumption 
that the mean IOP change for travoprost group will be at least 1 mm Hg better than timolol group, which is 
in line with the published literature.  
The  dose  for  this  Phase  3  study  (ie,  Travoprost  0.004%  PQ,  1  drop  once  daily)  was  that  currently 
recommended  in  the  product  information.  No  specific  dose-response  studies  were  conducted  in  the 
paediatric population. The dose choice is supported on the results of the pK study (C-12-009) where no dose 
adjustment by age was judged necessary. This is in line with other PGF2α analogues dosage.  
A lower dose of Travoprost has been recently approved by the EMA. Izba eye drops (containing Travoprost 
0.003% eye drops solution) showed certain advantages on safety without having impact on the IOP lowering 
effect in comparison to Travatan 0.004%. In principle, it would be expected that Travoprost 0.003% solution 
may  also  work  in  paediatric  population.  The  CHMP  recommends  the  MAH  to  consider  submitting  a  line 
extension of the Travatan marketing authorisation to include a lower strength formulation for a paediatric 
indication. In addition, CHMP recommends that the MAH requests Scientific Advice in order to confirm what 
data would be appropriate to support this extension.  
The  shorter  wash-out  of  previous  IOP-lowering  medication  has  been  allowed  to  minimize  the  risk  of 
treatment withdrawn in children and is therefore accepted. The use of two different doses of timolol can 
affect the interpretation of results, but the rationale to minimize risk of timolol in the younger children is 
understood and accepted.  
The main analysis of efficacy was based on the reduction of IOP levels after 3 months of treatment. The 
study also investigated the effect of Travoprost at different time points (at Week 2 and 6) and the control of 
IOP  in  terms  of  responder  rates.  IOP  was  measured  in  both  eyes  at  every  visit  at  9  AM  (±  60  min), 
approximately 12 hours after the study drug administration. The measurement of diurnal IOP variations 
(intended to detect the peak and through effect of the medicinal product) would have been of interest. The 
difficulties  of  IOP  measurement  in  children  are  acknowledged.  As  the  morning  IOP  level  represents  the 
highest point during the day the proposed time point can be considered an acceptable measurement.  
This 3-month study addresses the question of the short-term efficacy of the product. In principle there are 
no reasons to believe that efficacy data beyond 3 months would differ from that measured within this period.  
For the comparison between travoprost and timolol a non-inferiority margin of + 3.0 mmHg has been used. 
This margin seems wide but it has been considered to be acceptable in this case.  It has been also accepted 
in the past for other compounds (e.g Study A6111137, where Latanoprost 0.005% BAK and Timolol 0.5% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 20/39 
 
  
  
were compared; Maeda-Chubachi at al, 2011). Both the ITT and PP analysis sets were used to evaluate the 
primary efficacy endpoint. Although the Per Protocol (PP) set is the preferred population for a non-inferiority 
analysis, both analyses are expected to lead to similar conclusions. The lack of disparities between ITT and 
PP analyses would also provide robustness to the results. 
It is noted that the study did not use any formal methods to evaluate compliance of patients in using study 
medications. However, the study had other measures like informal enquiries by the study personnel who 
were trained to discuss the dosing regimen at each study visit and also ensure that the patients had been 
dosing the medications appropriately. In the light of reasonable compliance reported in paediatric glaucoma, 
the above measures are considered acceptable.   
6  out  of  10  patients  in  the  youngest  age  group  (2  months  to  3  years)  showed  a  positive  response  to 
treatment  with  Travoprost  and  3  out  of  10  patients  showed  a  negative  response.  While  2  out  of  the  3 
non-responders had Non-PCG, the numbers available are too small to draw any robust inferences. Based on 
the limited data available, it can be accepted that a relevant treatment effect of Travoprost is seen in some 
patients in this age group and the difference in the mean change in IOP between two treatments is affected 
significantly by one patient who had a large negative treatment response of +14 mmHg change in IOP from 
baseline. Therefore, an indication in age group 2 to < 3 years is accepted, especially as the limited data in 
this age group is appropriately highlighted to the prescriber in the Product Information.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All 152 randomized patients were included in the ITT and safety analysis sets (77 patients in Travoprost 
0.004% PQ group and 75 patients in Timolol group). A total of 151 patients were included in the PP analysis 
set. 
Most of the recruited subjects (70.4%) had non congenital glaucoma. Ocular hypertension was present in 
17.8%  of  study  patients.  The  mean  baseline  IOP  measurements  were  similar  across  study  drug  groups 
regardless  of  whether  the  patients  were  diagnosed  with  PCG  or  non-PCG  (25.1  and  24.2  mmHg, 
respectively). About two thirds had a baseline IOP < 27 mmHg (77.0%). Most of the randomized patients 
were 3 to less than 12 years of age (52.0%) and there were more females (52.6%) than males. No patients 
with  corticosteroid-induced  ocular  hypertension  and  glaucoma  were  specifically  recruited.    The  MAH  has 
provided  the  response  data  to  travoprost  (and  timolol)  from  patients  on  stable  corticosteroid  treatment 
during the study. Although the limited number of patients precludes achieving comprehensive conclusions, 
no different response to travoprost is observed in this subgroup. 
The  majority  of  patients  (62%)  had  been  on  anti-glaucoma  treatment  at  recruitment:  prostaglandin 
analogue, α2 adrenergic agonist, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor or β adrenergic agonist. 
A total of 38 out of 151 evaluable patients for PP analysis (30.3% of patients on Travatan 0.004% PQ and 
20% of patients on Timolol) were not finally analysed. The most frequent reason for exclusion was the visit 
outside the study window without significant imbalance between both groups.  
According PP and ITT analysis sets results it was demonstrated that Travatan 0.004% was non inferior to 
Timolol. The upper confidence limits of the differences in the mean IOP change from baseline between study 
drug groups (Travatan and Timolol groups) was well less than 3.0 mmHg margin. 
The mean IOP reduction achieved after three month treatment was similar for both compounds (PP data 
Travatan -6.4 mmHg, Timolol -5.8 mmHg). The results from ITT analysis were also consistent. The reduction 
in  IOP  from  baseline  is  a  clinically  relevant  reduction  in  both  treatment  groups. As  it  was  pre-specified, 
superiority of Travoprost to Timolol was evaluated. It was not achieved in either the PP or ITT analysis sets. 
The  IOP  lowering  effect  of  Travatan  does  not  appear  to  be  significantly  different  when  patients  with  or 
without  ocular  hypertension  were  taken  into  account.  The  results  of  the  primary  analysis  were  obtained 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 21/39 
 
  
  
based  on  the  ANCOVA  model  that  was  pre-specified  in  the  protocol.  The  pre-specified  ANCOVA  model 
included baseline IOP, treatment and diagnosis.  
The use of LOCF in the handling of missing data was justified as being appropriately conservative in this 
setting. In addition, the MAH provided sensitivity analysis where all missing IOP changes from baseline were 
imputed with the worst on-therapy IOP change experienced during the study. The results of the sensitivity 
analysis were consistent with the results of the LOCF imputation.  
In  general,  the  effect  evidenced  in  the  primary  endpoint  was  also  translated  into  the  main  secondary 
endpoints. No relevant differences were observed between Travoprost and Timolol.  The IOP lowering effect 
was apparent from the first two weeks under both treatments. After three months the IOP level achieved 
was  17.9  mmHg  and  18.0  mmHg,  respectively.  Patients  treated  with  Travatan  experienced  a  27.6% 
reduction of the baseline IOP and the reduction for Timolol group was 24.9%.  
The relevance of the IOP  reduction has been evaluated as responder rates. Overall, 83% of patients on 
travoprost and 74.3% of patients on timolol attained a 15% reduction in IOP. Similarly, 71.8% of patients 
treated with travoprost and 66.2% of patients treated with timolol achieved a normal IOP, according to the 
pre-established age normal range.   
In general, exploratory comparison between travoprost and timolol showed numerical differences in favour 
of travoprost. 
The number of patients who were withdrawn due to treatment failure was higher in travoprost (n=6) as 
compared to timolol (n=1). Sensitivity analyses conducted by the MAH in order to address the impact of this 
difference did not show potential bias. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted by age category (2 months to < 3 years, 3 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 
18 years), sex, ethnicity, race, iris colour, baseline IOP stratum (< 27 mmHg, 27–31 mmHg, and > 31 
mmHg), and diagnosis primary congenital glaucoma (PCG or non-PCG). No substantial differences between 
Travoprost and Timolol in IOP lowering effect were observed by different subgroups. Of note, the youngest 
group of patients (from 2 months to < 3 years) responded better to Timolol than to Travoprost. This may be 
due to small numbers and the high variability of this subgroup. Additionally, the lack of differences between 
treatments in other related subgroups such as the primary congenital glaucoma patients prevent from 
drawing sound conclusions in this regard. Appropriate clarification and additional warning statements 
regarding the limited efficacy data in the youngest age group are included in the Product Information.  
The applicant provided additional analyses which include an estimated treatment effect with centre as fixed 
effect in the model. This analysis is supportive of travoprost in both the ITT and PP sets. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the results from study C-12-008, Travatan 0.004% eye drops solution has shown non-inferiority to 
Timolol 0.5% in the IOP lowering effect produced in paediatric patients aged 2 months to < 18 years of age, 
with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1 Introduction 
The clinical development of Travoprost 0.004% PQ in patients < 18 years of age with glaucoma or ocular 
hypertension consisted of  one pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical trial (C-12-009) of 7 days duration and one

phase  3  safety  and  efficacy  clinical  trial  (C-12-008)  of  3  month  duration.  An  evaluation  of  safety  was 
conducted on all patients who were enrolled into these two clinical trials and received study drug.  
Four travoprost formulations have been approved in adult patients: Travoprost 0.004% BAK, PQ and SofZia  
and  Travoprost  0.003%  PQ.  Therefore,  clinical  data  and  the  postmarketing  experience  with  the  already 
approved travoprost formulations in adult patients are of relevance and supportive. 
In addition, safety data regarding the off-label use of travoprost in paediatric patient from two literature 
articles (Helmanova, 2007 and Yanovitch, 2009) and from the MAH’s safety database have been provided. 
This information is considered supportive to characterize the long-term safety profile of Travoprost 0.004% 
PQ in paediatric patients. 
On the whole, the MAH’s approach established for the safety analysis is considered acceptable. 
Indirect comparison between Travoprost 0.004% PQ (C-12-008) and historical data of Travoprost 0.004% 
PQ  has  been  provided  in  order  to  obtain  an  estimated  conclusion  regarding  the  overall  safety  profile  of 
Travoprost 0.004% in paediatric patients in comparison to adult patients.  
Safety parameters have been measured during studies C-12-008 and C-12-009 and included the following: 
•  Adverse events 
•  Vitals signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiration rate and body temperature) 
• 
Patient alertness 
•  Visual acuity 
•  Slit-lamp examination (eyelids/conjunctiva, cornea, lens, and iris/anterior including aqueous flare 
and inflammatory cells) 
•  Visual fields 
•  Central corneal thickness 
•  Ocular hyperemia 
•  Corneal diameter 
• 
Fundus parameters (vitreous, retina, macula, choroid, optic nerve, and cup/disc ratio) 
•  12-lead ECG 
• 
Intraocular pressure (PK study only) 
In both clinical trials adverse events were collected by: 
•  Solicited comments from study patients and/or the patient’s parents (or legal guardian) 
•  Observations by the study investigator 
Patient exposure 
102 paediatric patients were exposed to one drop administration of Travoprost 0.004% PQ once daily during 
the clinical development (77 patients exposed to Travoprost 0.004% PQ in study C-12-008 and 25 patients 
exposed  to  Travoprost  0.004%  PQ  in  study  C-12-009).  The  sample  size  of  the  safety  population  is 
considered limited for the overall safety analysis and firm conclusions with regards to some adverse events 
could be difficult to draw. As previously stated, safety data collected from historical confirmatory clinical 
trials in adults are considered supportive.

* 6 months and 12 months continuous exposure data, or intermittent exposure. 
The cumulative adult patient exposure since the first launch of Travoprost 0.004% (preserved with BAK, PQ 
or SofZia) is estimated to be approximately 16,189,436 patient-years (calculated based on worldwide 
sales). 
Regarding the duration of exposure, the majority of patients were exposed during approximately 3 months 
(61% patients exposed higher than 87 days and 33.8% patients exposed between 46-48 days). The mean 
duration of exposure to travoprost 0.004% PQ is 84 days. 
Some adverse events already known for topical PGAs generally occur after several months to years of dosing 
(eg.  periocular  skin  hyperpigmentation  or  discolouration,  iris  hyperpigmentation,  changes  in  eyelash 
characteristics and stimulation of melanogenese). Indeed, five cases with growth of eyelashes were reported 
during C-12-008. Given that the potential incidence of these AEs with the prolonged use of travoprost cannot 
be  ruled  out,  they  are  already  included  in  the  RMP  and  should  be  closely  monitored  in  the  PSURs.  The 
absence  of  long-term  clinical  data  is  a  limitation.  However,  long-term  data  from  the  off-label  use  of 
travoprost  0.004%  PQ  in  paediatric  patients  were  provided:  two  studies  published  of  18  and  28  month 
duration (Yanovitch, 2009 and Helmanova, 2007, respectively) and a safety database collected by Alcon 
since Travatan was approved in 2001 for adult patients (see Figure 1). This information reveals that the type 
of  the  adverse  events  reported  were  similar  to  adults.  Eyelash  thickening  and  elongation,  ocular 
hyperaemia, ocular irritation, conjunctival redness and skin pigmentation were the most common adverse 
events. No new risks, no systemic adverse events and no increase in the incidence of the already known 
adverse events were observed with long-term exposure to travoprost 0.004% PQ.

The demographic characteristics of patients include three groups of age (from 2 months to less than 18 
years) with approximately 50% of patients between 3 and 12 years and mean age of 9.6 years. Around 70% 
of patients were diagnosed with non-primary congenital glaucoma (Non-PCG). A high variety of races was 
included. In general, the studied population is considered representative of the population that is expected 
to receive Travoprost 0.004% PQ.

Adverse events  
The majority of treatment-emergent AEs reported for either treatment group during the main study were 
local ocular effects with a known causal association with the use of topical ocular eye drops and the use of 
prostaglandin  analogue  (PGAs)  or  beta-blocker.  For  instance,  eye  disorders  such  as  ocular  hyperaemia, 
conjunctival hyperaemia, growth of eyelashes, eye pruritus were more commonly reported in the Travatan 
group in comparison to the timolol group.  
No systemic adverse drug reaction (ADR) or serious ADR was reported with the use of Travoprost 0.004% 
PQ. Regarding results from C-12-009 PK study, lower systemic exposure is expected when travoprost is 
topically administered. Therefore, no systemic adverse events are anticipated. In addition, the occurrence of 
adverse events is unlikely regarding the limited number of patients exposed to travoprost and the short 
duration of the studies.  
The most common adverse drug reactions were eye disorders. Ocular hyperemia was the most common ADR 
(16.9%) reported with the use of Travoprost 0.004% PQ and is a very common local side effect that has 
been reported in adult patients (≥  18 years of age) with the use of Travoprost and other topical ocular 
prostaglandin analogues (PGAs) (eg. latanoprost, bimatoprost). Other ocular ADRs reported with the use of 
Travoprost 0.004% PQ were for local ocular effects associated with the use of a topical ocular medication 
(eg.  ocular  discomfort,  photophobia,  tearing,  dry  eye,  corneal  surface  irritation)  and  occurred  as  single 
events within a study treatment or with a known causal association with the use of a topical ocular PGA (ie. 
growth of eyelashes). 
In C-12-008 study when both treatment groups are compared, a higher incidence of adverse drug reactions 
in  travoprost  group  (26%)  versus  timolol  group  (12%)  is  observed.  From  a  qualitative  point  of  view, 
different ADRs are reported due to the different mechanism of action of the active substances. 
When  both  populations  exposed  to  travoprost  (paediatric  versus  adult  patients)  are  compared,  from  a 
qualitative point of view the overall safety profile in paediatric patients might be similar to the one observed 
in adult patients as the formulation is the same as the one approved for adults (travoprost 0.004% PQ). 
However, from a quantitative point of view, the most common adverse drug event observed with travoprost 
(i.e ocular hyperemia) has been reported with a higher incidence in paediatric population (16.9%) compared 
to adults (11.4%). However, given that this adverse event is not considered serious and disappears when 
the  treatment  is  discontinued,  this  increase  in  ocular  hyperemia  in  paediatric  patients  is  not  considered 
particularly worrisome.

Overall,  based  on  a  review  of  ADRs,  no  new  AEs  different  from  the  already  known  safety  profile  for 
travoprost  0.004%  were  reported  in  paediatric  population.  Moreover,  no  increased  risk  for  the  use  of 
Travoprost 0.004% PQ was identified for paediatric patients including patients below the age of 2 years. The 
types  and  characteristics  of  the  ADRs  reported  with  the  use  of  Travoprost  0.004%  PQ  in  the  paediatric 
population were consistent with ADRs reported in previous clinical trial experience with Travoprost 0.004% 
(preserved with BAK, sofZia, or PQ) involving adult patients. 
Study C-12-009 
Table below summarizes treatment-emergent AEs reported in the study. All AEs reported during the study 
were reported as single events. No patient experienced more than 1 AE (ie, MedDRA Preferred Term) during 
the study.  
Adverse drug reactions (ie, treatment related AEs) (ADRs) reported in the study included single events for 
ocular hyperemia, eye pruritus, and eye pain. No patient experienced an ADR associated with an untoward 
change in their systemic health. Patients under the age of 3 years did not experience an ADR. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths nor serious adverse drug reactions or discontinuations of the study participation were reported 
during  both  clinical  studies.  Only  one  paediatric  patient  underwent  a  trabeculectomy  surgery  in  the 
travoprost group. However, this serious adverse event was not considered related to the study drug what is 
reassuring.

Laboratory findings 
No  clinical  laboratory  evaluations  were  performed  in  the  paediatric  clinical  development  of  Travoprost 
0.004% PQ. 
In general, a review of changes from baseline in safety assessments (ie. vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, 
respiration  rate,  and  body  temperature),  12-lead  ECG,  patient  alertness,  visual  acuity,  slit-lamp  exam 
(ocular signs), ocular hyperemia, intraocular pressure (C-12-009 only), corneal diameter, central corneal 
thickness, dilated fundus exam, and visual fields) did not reveal an increased safety concern for the use of 
Travoprost  0.004%  PQ  in  paediatric  patients  relative  to  adult  patients.  With  respect  to  12-lead 
electrocardiogram, given that low exposure to systemic travoprost is expected, changes in 12-lead ECG are 
unlikely.  Literature  regarding  the  off-label  use  of  Travoprost  0.004%  in  paediatric  patients  and  studies 
performed with other topical PGAs show reassuring data in relation to systemic adverse events. Overall, data 
submitted  do  not  seem  to  have  a  relevant  impact  on  the  cardiovascular  system.  However,  no  firm 
conclusions can be drawn due to the low number of patients included in the studies and the short duration 
of exposure to travoprost.  
As previously mentioned, the most common ocular sign change from baseline reported in travoprost group 
was ocular hyperemia. The higher incidence of ocular hyperemia in travoprost group (16.9%) in comparison 
to timolol group (1.3%) is not unpredicted due to the already known safety profile for the prostaglandin 
analogues.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 30/39 
 
  
  
 
 
Optic nerve changes from baseline were reported in both treatment groups. However, the incidence of this 
adverse event was higher in travoprost group (8.6%) in comparison to timolol group (2.8%). This difference 
between treatment groups has been further clarified by the MAH. According to the justification and data 
provided, changes in optic nerve and the increase in the cup/disc ratio value could indicate a progression of 
glaucoma rather than an adverse event linked to the exposure to Travatan.  
Safety in special populations 
Regarding the incidence of adverse events by age group, in the travoprost group it was similar for children 
(2 to 11 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years). Infants and toddlers (28 days to 23 months) were the 
Assessment report

population with lower incidence of ADRs. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn due to the low number 
of patients included in the studies and the short duration of exposure to travoprost. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interactions were reported in clinical trials C-12-008 and C-12-009. Drug-drug interactions with 
other  concomitantly  administered  drugs  are  not  likely  given  that  plasma  levels  following  topical  ocular 
administration of Travoprost 0.004% are very low. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No patient in clinical trial C-12-008 or C-12-009 discontinued study participation due to an AE. 
Post marketing experience 
Travoprost is currently not marketed for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. However, Travoprost 
0.004% preserved with BAK, SofZia and POLYQUAD have been marketed in adult patients since 2001, 2006 
and 2010, respectively, and Travoprost 0.003% preserved with POLYQUAD was approved for marketing in 
the adult population by the EMA in February 2014 and has since been launched in the EU. The latest Periodic 
Safety Update Report (PSUR) for Travoprost (40 and 30 μg/mL) summarizing the safety data received from 
world-wide sources by the MAH’s Medical Safety Department covering the time period from 01 March 2013 
to 28 February 2014 was submitted. This PSUR did not indicate new or changing safety signals associated 
with the use of Travoprost (40 or 30 μg/mL) and their benefit/risk assessments remained favourable (and 
unchanged), for the indication of lowering IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This extension of indication to include paediatric patients is supported by two clinical studies: C-12-008 (a 
3-month phase 3 safety and efficacy study) and C-12-009 (7-day pharmacokinetic study). Clinical data and 
the post-marketing experience available with the already approved travoprost formulations in adult patients 
are of relevance and supportive for this application. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 32/39 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The studied population is considered representative of the population that is expected to receive Travoprost 
0.004% PQ. 
On the whole, the MAH’s approach established for the safety analysis is considered acceptable. Travoprost 
has been authorised in adults for a number of years and its safety profile in adults has been well 
characterised in clinical studies and post-marketing monitoring in adults. An indirect comparison between 
Travoprost 0.004% PQ (C-12-008) and historical data of Travoprost 0.004% PQ has been provided by the 
MAH. The most common adverse reactions reported in adults were ocular hyperaemia and iris 
hyperpigmentation occurring in approximately 20% and 6% respectively. The other common adverse 
reactions reported in adults include eye pain, ocular discomfort, dry eye, eye pruritus and eye irritation. The 
adverse event profile in children appears to be broadly similar to that in adults.  
The current clinical development program in children has evaluated the short-term exposure of travoprost 
for up to 12 weeks in 102 children (77 patients exposed to Travoprost 0.004% PQ in study C-12-008 and 25 
patients exposed to Travoprost 0.004% PQ in study C-12-009). The sample size of the safety population is 
considered limited for the overall safety analysis. Regarding the duration of exposure, the majority of 
patients were exposed during approximately 3 months (mean duration of exposure is 84 days). Given the 
possibility of new risks and the potential occurrence of some events with the prolonged use of travoprost 
(i.e. periocular skin hyperpigmentation or discolouration, iris hyperpigmentation, changes in eyelash 
characteristics and stimulation of melanogenese), the lack of long-term safety data is considered a limitation 
of this application. However, supportive data coming from two published studies of 18 and 28 month 
duration and a safety database prepared by the MAH concerning the off-label use of Travoprost 0.004% PQ 
in the paediatric population were provided. This information reveals that the type of the adverse events 
reported were similar to adults. Eyelash thickening and elongation, ocular hyperaemia, ocular irritation, 
conjunctival redness and skin pigmentation were the most common adverse events. No new risks, no 
systemic adverse events and no increase in the incidence of the already known adverse events were 
observed with long-term exposure to travoprost 0.004% PQ. 
In study C-12-008, the treatment emergent adverse events with an incidence of 5% or more included ocular 
hyperaemia (19.5%), conjunctival hyperaemia (5.2%), growth of eyelashes (6.5%) and headache (6.5%). 
Ocular hyperaemia events related to the treatment with travoprost have been reported with a higher 
incidence in paediatric population (16.9%) compared to adults (11.4%). Given that this adverse event is not 
considered serious and disappears when the treatment is discontinued, this increase in ocular hyperemia in 
paediatric patients is not considered particularly worrisome. 
The CHMP noted that study C-11-034 submitted in support of Marketing Authorisation Application for Izba 
(travoprost 0,003%) which compared Izba versus Travatan (Travoprost 0.004% PQ) in adults revealed that 
lower exposure to travoprost caused less incidence of hyperemia of the eye (ocular hyperemia with 
travoprost 0.003% PQ: 6.1% versus 11.4% with travoprost 0.004% PQ) without having a relevant impact 
on the IOP lowering effect. Therefore, the CHMP recommends that the MAH considers submitting a line 
extension of the Travatan marketing authorisation to include this lower concentration formulation in a 
paediatric indication. In addition, CHMP recommends that the MAH requests Scientific Advice in order to 
confirm what data would be appropriate to support this extension. 
There have been no significant new safety concerns identified with this exposure in children. Nevertheless it 
is noted that the adverse events of headache and growth of eyelashes were reported at higher frequency 
(>5%) in children while the SmPC reports these reactions as uncommon in adults. All the events of growth 
of eyelashes were considered related and is therefore an adverse reaction occurring with high incidence in 
children which needs to be included in the SmPC. The events of headache all appear to be considered 
not-related as a review of the event characteristics (eg, severity, outcome, causality, and effect on study 
participation) of the headaches revealed that they were similar between the Travoprost 0.004% PQ and 
Timolol groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 33/39 
 
  
  
In general, it is reassuring that there were no serious adverse reactions or significant changes in the ocular 
assessments. Optic nerve changes from baseline were reported in both treatment groups. However, the 
incidence of this adverse event was higher in travoprost group (8.6%) in comparison to timolol group 
(2.8%). This difference between treatment groups has been further clarified by the MAH. According to the 
justification and data provided, changes in optic nerve and the increase in the cup/disc ratio value could 
indicate a progression of glaucoma rather than an adverse event linked to the exposure to Travatan. It is 
also reassuring that an analysis of safety events based on pre-specified paediatric age-groups did not show 
any meaningful differences in the types and characteristics of adverse events between the different age 
groups. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn due to the low number of patients included in the studies 
and the short duration of exposure to travoprost. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
This extension of indication to include paediatric patients is supported by two clinical studies: C-12-008 (a 
3-month  phase  3  safety  and  efficacy  study)  and  C-12-009  (7-day  pharmacokinetic  study).  Safety  data 
coming from clinical trials and post marketing experience available with the already approved travoprost 
formulations in adult patients are considered of relevance and supportive for this application. 
As expected, the most common adverse drug reactions were eye disorders (ocular hyperemia - 16.9% and 
growth  of  eyelashes  –  6.5%)  with  higher  incidence  of  adverse  events  in  travoprost  group  compared  to 
timolol group was observed. Overall, the safety profile in paediatric population is consistent with the safety 
profile for adult population and with the one already known for other topical ocular prostaglandin analogues 
(i.e. latanoprost, bimatoprost). The incidence of growth of eye-lashes is higher in children as compared to 
adults and this is reflected in the SmPC. 
Generally, short-term data submitted are reassuring. However, the absence of long-term data is considered 
a weakness of the dossier. To address this issue, the MAH has provided available literature and a safety 
database produced by Alcon related to the off-label use of travoprost in paediatric population. Given that no 
concern has been raised from this data, the submission of annual PSURs is considered sufficient to control 
long-term safety profile.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8 is acceptable. In addition, minor revisions 
were recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update. The PRAC endorsed PRAC 
Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 8 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The CHMP considered that the submitted type II variation to include a paediatric indication for Travatan 
0.004% does not represent a significant change to the Package Leaflet (PL) and therefore the user 
consultation with target patient groups on the PL is not required.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Travatan 0.004% eye drops Solution (containing Travoprost, a prostaglandin analogue) is indicated for the 
decrease of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular 
hypertension. The MAH is seeking an extension of the indication to paediatric patients 2 months to < 18 
years of age with ocular hypertension or glaucoma.  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
One  phase  3  clinical  trial  supported  the  proposed  extension  of  the  indication.  The  study  was  aimed  to 
demonstrate that Travoprost 0.004% PQ was comparable (non inferior) to Timolol 0.5% in the reduction of 
IOP in paediatric patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
Travoprost has been authorised since 2001 for reducing IOP and has a well-established safety and efficacy 
profile in adults. The options for children with raised IOP are comparatively limited and the development of 
travoprost  for  use  in  children  will  offer  an  additional  treatment  option  which  is  reasonably  supported  by 
prospective clinical data.  
The treatment with Travoprost showed to have a similar IOP lowering efficacy to that achieved by Timolol. 
After  three  month  treatment  the  mean  IOP  was  reduced  by  6.4  mmHg  (Timolol  lowering  effect  was  5.8 
mmHg). The upper confidence limits of the differences in the mean IOP change from baseline between study 
drug groups (Travatan and Timolol groups) were well within the 3.0 mmHg margin. Results were consistent 
for PP and ITT analyses. The IOP lowering effect of Travatan does not appear to be significantly different 
when patients with or without ocular hypertension were taken into account. 
The IOP-lowering effect was observed from  Week 2 of treatment to the end of the study (Month 3). 
Patients treated with Travatan experienced a 27.6% reduction of the baseline IOP and the reduction for 
Timolol group was 24.9%. The IOP levels achieved in Travatan and Timolol groups were 17.9 mmHg and 
18.0 mmHg, respectively. When the relevance of the IOP reduction was evaluated as responder rates, 83% 
of patients on travoprost and 74.3% of patients on timolol attained a 15% reduction in IOP. Similarly, 71.8% 
of  patients  treated  with  travoprost  and  66.2%  of  patients  treated  with  timolol  achieved  a  normal  IOP, 
according to the pre-established age normal range.   
In general, exploratory comparison between travoprost and timolol showed numerical differences in favour 
of travoprost. No substantial differences between Travoprost and Timolol were observed when the effect was

analysed by age, sex, ethnicity, race, iris colour, baseline IOP stratum and diagnosis primary congenital 
glaucoma (PCG or non-PCG).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Only short-term data of the use of Travoprost in paediatric glaucoma and ocular hypertension have been 
evaluated. Although paediatric glaucoma is a primarily surgical condition some patients may require chronic 
pharmacological treatment. In principle there is no reason to believe that efficacy data beyond 3 months 
would differ from that measured during this period.  
No specific dose-response studies were conducted in the paediatric population. The dose selected for this 
Phase 3 study was based on the results from Study C-12-009 where no dose adjustment by age was judged 
necessary so that in the Phase 3 study paediatric patients received the dose recommended for adults. 
In  the  efficacy  study  a  total  of  38  out  of  151  evaluable  patients  for  PP  analysis  (30.3%  of  patients  on 
Travatan 0.004% PQ and 20% of patients on Timolol) were not finally analysed. The most frequent reason 
for exclusion was the visit outside the study window without significant imbalance between both groups. 
Sensitivity analyses conducted by the MAH in order to address the impact of this difference did not show in 
principle potential bias. 
The IOP diurnal curve in children treated with Travoprost is unknown. IOP was measured in both eyes at 9 
AM (± 60 min), approximately 12 hours after the study drug administration. The difficulties of measurement 
and interpretation of IOP in children are acknowledged. As the morning IOP level represents the highest 
point during the day the assessment of the Travoprost IOP lowering effect is acceptable.   
Children aged 2 months to less than 3 years showed higher plasma levels and lesser response to Travoprost 
than the older group (from 3 to 18 years). The mean change in IOP caused by Travoprost (-1.8 mm Hg) was 
lower than the lowering of IOP caused by timolol (-7.3) after 3 months treatment, and this is reflected in the 
SPC. Nevertheless, 60% of patients in this age group who received Travoprost, showed IOP reduction. 
It is acknowledged that the number of patients in both the treatment groups from this age range was small 
(9 patients in the Travoprost group and 6 patients in the timolol group) and therefore these results may not 
be inferential. In addition, given the mechanism of action of each compound (beta-blockers act by reducing 
the rate of aqueous production and prostaglandin analogues reduce IOP by increasing uveoscleral outflow) 
and that congenital glaucoma may be associated to developmental anomalies in the trabecular meshwork 
area the existence of true differences cannot be totally discarded. The limitations of data collected in this age 
group have been highlighted to the prescribers in the Product Information.  
Infants younger than 2 month were excluded from the study. A waiver was granted to this group of patients 
on the grounds that the specific medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit as 
clinical studies are not feasible. There are no data to support the use in this population. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Safety data from the two clinical studies submitted by the MAH (a 7-day pharmacokinetic study - C-12-009 
and a 3-month phase 3 safety and efficacy study - C-12-008) reveal that the most common adverse drug 
reactions observed with Travoprost 0.004% PQ in the paediatric population are ocular hyperemia (16.9%) 
and growth of eyelashes (6.5%). These events were associated with the use of travoprost. In addition, eye 
pruritus,  photophobia,  erythema  of  eyelid  and  keratitis  were  reported  with  an  incidence  of  1.3%  in  the 
travoprost group. These AEs are compatible with the already known safety profile of Travoprost 0.004% in 
adults  and  with  the  known  effects  derived  from  the  use  of  topical  ocular  PGAs.  Although  iris 
hyperpigmentation, which is a frequently reported adverse event in adults, has not been reported in children 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 37/39 
 
  
  
in study C-12-008, this is possibly due to the short treatment duration in this study and it is anticipated that 
this event may also occur in children. 
In general, the overall incidence of adverse drug reactions in travoprost group was higher than in timolol 
group (26% and 12%, respectively). Ocular hyperemia was the most common ADR and was reported with 
a higher incidence in paediatric population (16.9%) compared to adults (11.4%). Given that this adverse 
event is not considered serious and is reversible, this increase in ocular hyperemia in paediatric patients is 
not considered particularly worrisome. However, it is noted that the adverse events of headache and growth 
of  eyelashes  were  reported  at  higher  frequency  (>5%)  in  children  while  the  currently  approved  SmPC 
reports these reactions as uncommon in adults. A review of the headache characteristics confirmed that 
none  of  the  reported  headaches  were  related  to  treatment.  The  relatively  larger  incidence  of  ‘growth  of 
eyelashes’    in  children  as  compared  to  adults  may  not  lead  to  a  clinically  significant  adverse  effect  like 
keratitis, but nevertheless the increase in incidence has been included in the SmPC.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Considering the safety data provided in this application, the main uncertainty refers to the lack of long-term 
safety data in the paediatric population. Some adverse events already known for topical PGAs (i.e. periocular 
skin  hyperpigmentation or discolouration, iris hyperpigmentation, changes in  eyelash characteristics and 
stimulation of melanogenese) and the potential occurrence of new risks can appear over time. Therefore, the 
short duration of exposure is considered a limitation of this application. To address the absence of long-term 
data the MAH has provided available literature and a safety database produced by the MAH related to the 
off-label use of travoprost in paediatric population. Given that no concern has been raised from this data, the 
submission of annual PSURs is considered sufficient to carefully monitor long-term safety profile. 
Based  on  data  provided  regarding  optic  nerve  changes  from  baseline,  the  higher  incidence  reported  in 
travoprost group compared to timolol group (8.6% vs 2.8%) could indicate a progression of glaucoma rather 
than an adverse event linked to the exposure to Travatan. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Travoprost provides a useful, proven and well-tolerated alternative treatment option to treat children with 
raised  IOP.  The  efficacy  of  travoprost  in  children  has  been  shown  to  be  comparable  to  timolol.  The 
established safety profile of travoprost in adults has less of the systemic side effects as compared to timolol. 
The low systemic exposure ascertained in the paediatric PK study (study C-12-009) provides reassurance 
that the systemic safety of travoprost in children may be similar to that of adults. The safety data from study 
C-12-008, where children were treated for up to 12 weeks, did not raise any new safety concerns.  
However, a higher frequency of ‘ growth of eyelashes’ in children compared to adults has been specified in 
the product information.  
Furthermore, the overall safety data in children is limited and there is no long-term safety data in children. 
The  submission  of  annual  PSURs  is  considered  sufficient  to  carefully  monitor  long-term  safety  profile  in 
paediatric patients. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Travoprost has a well-established efficacy and safety profile in adults. Available data in children has shown 
that travoprost has comparable efficacy to timolol in lowering IOP in children aged 2 months to 18 years. 
However a sub-group analysis based on age showed that in children aged 2 months to less than 3 years, the 
effects of travoprost on lowering IOP was lower than timolol. This information has been included in the 
SmPC.  
With respect to the safety profile of Travoprost 0.004% PQ in the paediatric population, adverse events 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/673466/2014 
Page 38/39 
 
  
  
reported during study C-12-008 seem compatible with the already known safety profile of Travoprost 
0.004% in adults and with the effects already known with the use of topical ocular PGAs. No new safety 
concern of significance was reported. The PK evaluations in children showed that systemic exposures were 
generally lower than currently measurable levels, therefore it is not possible to conclude that the systemic 
exposure in children is comparable to that in adults and this has been appropriately communicated in the 
SmPC.  
Moreover, long-term safety data in the paediatric population will be monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance as part of the annual PSURs.

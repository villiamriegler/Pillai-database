CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
CAMZYOS is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic (New York Heart Association, NYHA, 
class II-III) obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) in adult patients (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of 
patients with cardiomyopathy. 
Before treatment initiation, patients’ left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be assessed by 
echocardiography (see section 4.4). If LVEF is < 55%, treatment should not be initiated. 
Before initiation of treatment, women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test 
(see section 4.4 and 4.6). 
Patients should be genotyped for Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 (CYP2C19) in order to determine 
appropriate mavacamten dose. Patients with CYP2C19 poor metabolizer phenotype may have 
increased mavacamten exposures (up to 3 times) that can lead to increased risk of systolic dysfunction 
compared to normal metabolizers (see section 4.4 and 5.2). If treatment initiation occurs prior to 
determination of CYP2C19 phenotype, patients should follow dosing instructions for poor 
metabolisers (see figure 1 and table 1) until CYP2C19 phenotype is determined. 
Posology 
The dose range is 2.5 mg to 15 mg (either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg). The bioequivalence 
between strengths has not been confirmed in a bioequivalence study in humans; therefore, the use of 
multiple capsules to achieve a prescribed dose is prohibited and one capsule of the appropriate dose 
strength should be used. 
CYP2C19 poor metaboliser phenotype 
The recommended starting dose is 2.5 mg orally once daily. The maximum dose is 5 mg once daily. 
The patient should be assessed for early clinical response by left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) 
gradient with Valsalva manoeuvre 4 and 8 weeks after treatment initiation (see figure 1). 
CYP2C19 intermediate, normal, rapid and ultra-rapid metaboliser phenotype 
The recommended starting dose is 5 mg orally once daily. The maximum dose is 15 mg once daily. 
The patient should be assessed for early clinical response by LVOT gradient with Valsalva manoeuvre 
4 and 8 weeks after treatment initiation (see figure 2). 
Once an individualised maintenance dose is achieved, patients should be assessed every 12 weeks (see 
figure 3). If at any visit the patient’s LVEF is < 50%, the treatment should be interrupted for 4 weeks 
and until LVEF returns to ≥ 50% (see figure 4). 
In patients experiencing an intercurrent illness such as serious infection or arrhythmia (including atrial 
fibrillation or other uncontrolled tachyarrhythmia) which may impair systolic function, LVEF 
assessment is recommended, and dose increases are not recommended until intercurrent illness is 
resolved (see section 4.4). 
Consideration should be given to discontinue treatment in patients who have shown no response (e.g., 
no improvement in symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity, LVOT gradient) after 4-6 months on 
the maximum tolerated dose.

Missed or delayed doses 
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible, and the next scheduled dose should be taken 
at the usual time the following day. Two doses should not be taken on the same day. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment to the standard dose and titration scheme is required for patients aged 65 years 
and older (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment to the standard dose and titration scheme is required for patients with mild 
(estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 60-89 mL/min/1.73m2) to moderate 
(eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment. No dose recommendation can be made for patients 
with severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment because mavacamten has not been studied 
in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The mavacamten starting dose should be 2.5 mg in all patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) and 
moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment since mavacamten exposure is likely to be 
increased (see section 5.2). No dose recommendation can be made for patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class C) because mavacamten has not been studied in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of mavacamten in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Mavacamten should not be used in children less than 12 years because of potential safety concerns. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Treatment should be taken once daily with or without meals at about the same time each day. Use a 
single capsule for a prescribed dose. The capsule should be swallowed whole with water.

 
 
Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients with CYP2C19 poor 
metaboliser phenotype and undetermined CYP2C19 phenotype (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5). 
Concomitant treatment with the combination of a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor and a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Systolic dysfunction defined as symptomatic LVEF < 50% 
Mavacamten reduces LVEF and may cause heart failure due to systolic dysfunction defined as 
symptomatic LVEF < 50%. Patients with a serious intercurrent illness such as infection or arrhythmia 
(including atrial fibrillation or other uncontrolled tachyarrhythmia), or those undergoing major cardiac 
surgery may be at greater risk of systolic dysfunction and progress to heart failure (see section 4.8). 
New or worsening dyspnoea, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations, leg oedema or elevations in N-terminal 
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) may be signs and symptoms of systolic dysfunction and 
should prompt an evaluation of cardiac function. LVEF should be measured prior to initiating 
treatment and closely monitored thereafter. Treatment interruption may be necessary to ensure that 
LVEF remains ≥ 50% (see section 4.2). 
Heart failure risk or loss of response to mavacamten due to interactions 
Mavacamten is primarily metabolised by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and mostly by 
CYP3A4 in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers, which may lead to the following interactions (see 
section 4.5): 
 
Starting or increasing the dose of a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor or any CYP2C19 
inhibitor may increase risk of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. 
Stopping or decreasing dose of any inhibitor of CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 may lead to a loss of 
therapeutic response to mavacamten. 
Starting a strong CYP3A4 or strong CYP2C19 inducer may lead to a loss of therapeutic 
response to mavacamten. 
Stopping a strong CYP3A4 or strong CYP2C19 inducer may increase risk of heart failure due to 
systolic dysfunction. 
 
 
 
Prior to and during mavacamten treatment, the potential for interactions, including over the counter 
medicinal products (such as omeprazole or esomeprazole), should be considered. 
 
Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients with CYP2C19 poor 
metaboliser phenotype and undetermined CYP2C19 phenotype is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Concomitant treatment with the combination of a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor and a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor is contraindicated (see section 4.3) 
Dose adjustment of mavacamten and/or close monitoring may be required in patients initiating 
or discontinuing treatment with, or changing the dose of concomitant medicinal products that 
are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (see section 4.2 and 4.5). Intermittent 
administration of these medicinal products is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
 
 
Concomitant use of negative inotropes 
The safety of concomitant use of mavacamten with disopyramide, or use of mavacamten in patients 
taking beta blockers in combination with verapamil or diltiazem has not been established. Therefore, 
patients should be closely monitored when taking these concomitant medicinal products (see 
section 4.5). 
Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Based on animal studies, mavacamten is suspected to cause embryo-foetal toxicity when administered 
to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3). Due to risk to the foetus, CAMZYOS is contraindicated during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. Before initiation 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of treatment, women of childbearing potential must be informed of this risk to the foetus, must have a 
negative pregnancy test and must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after 
treatment discontinuation (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially 'sodium-free'. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
If treatment with a new negative inotrope is initiated or if the dose of a negative inotrope is increased 
in a patient receiving mavacamten, close medical supervision with monitoring of LVEF should be 
provided until stable doses and clinical response have been achieved (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Effect of other medicinal products on mavacamten 
In CYP2C19 intermediate, normal, rapid and ultra-rapid metabolisers, mavacamten is primarily 
metabolised by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. In CYP2C19 poor metabolisers, 
metabolism is mostly by CYP3A4 (see section 5.2). CYP2C19 inhibitors/inducers and CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers may thus affect the clearance of mavacamten and increase/decrease mavacamten 
plasma concentration, and this will depend on the CYP2C19 phenotype. 
All clinical drug-drug interaction studies mainly enrolled CYP2C19 normal metabolisers and no 
CYP2C19 poor metabolisers were included in the assessment of the drug-drug interaction and 
therefore the effect of co-administration of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitors with mavacamten in 
CYP2C19 poor metabolisers is not completely certain. 
Recommendations for dose modification and/or additional monitoring of patients initiating or 
discontinuing treatment with, or changing the dose of, concomitant medicinal products that are 
inhibitors of CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 or inducers of CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 are provided in table 2. 
Strong CYP2C19 plus strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Co-administration of mavacamten with the combination of a strong CYP2C19 and a strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor is contra-indicated (see section 4.3). 
CYP2C19 inhibitors 
The effect of a moderate and strong CYP2C19 inhibitor on the PK of mavacamten was not 
investigated in a clinical drug-drug interaction study. The effect of a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor (e.g., 
ticlopidine) will be similar to the effect of the CYP2C19 poor metabolising status (see table 1). 
Co-administration of mavacamten with a weak CYP2C19 inhibitor (omeprazole) resulted in a 48% 
increase in mavacamten AUCinf with no effect on Cmax in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers. 
Intermittent administration of a CYP2C19 inhibitor (such as omeprazole or esomeprazole) is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Co-administration of mavacamten with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) in CYP2C19 normal 
metabolisers resulted in an increase in mavacamten plasma concentration of up to 59% and 40% in 
AUC0-24 and Cmax, respectively. 
Co-administration of mavacamten with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (verapamil) in CYP2C19 
normal metabolisers resulted in an increase in mavacamten plasma concentration of 16% and 52% in 
AUCinf and Cmax, respectively. This change was not considered clinically significant. 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inducers 
No clinical interaction studies were conducted to investigate the effect of concomitant administration 
with a strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inducer. Co-administration of mavacamten with a strong 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inducer of both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampicin) is expected to significantly affect the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of mavacamten and leads to reduced efficacy and therefore co-administration 
with strong inducers of both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is not recommended. If discontinuing 
concomitant treatment with a strong inducer of CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 increase clinical assessments 
and mavacamten dose should be reduced (see section 4.2).

a  Omeprazole is considered a weak CYP2C19 inhibitor at a dose of 20 mg once daily and a moderate CYP2C19 
inhibitor at a total daily dose of 40 mg. 
Effect of mavacamten on other medicinal products 
Mavacamten in vitro data suggest a potential induction of CYP3A4 substrates. Co-administration of a 
17-day course of mavacamten at clinical relevant exposures in CYP2C19 normal, rapid and ultra-rapid 
metabolisers did not decrease the exposure to ethinyl oestradiol and norethindrone, which are the 
components of typical oral contraceptives and substrates for CYP3A4. Furthermore, co-administration 
of a 16-day course of mavacamten in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers, at clinical relevant exposures, 
resulted in a 13% decrease in midazolam plasma concentration. This change was not considered 
clinically significant.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in females 
CAMZYOS is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception 
(see section 4.3). Therefore, before initiation of treatment in women of childbearing potential, a 
negative pregnancy test result must be available and counselling should be provided regarding the 
serious risk to the foetus. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during 
treatment and for 6 months after discontinuation of CAMZYOS, since it takes approximately 
5 half-lives (approximately 45 days for CYP2C19 normal metabolisers and 115 days for CYP2C19 
poor metabolisers) to eliminate mavacamten from the body after treatment discontinuation (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
When stopping mavacamten therapy for planning a pregnancy the possible return of LVOT 
obstruction and symptom burden should be considered (see section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of mavacamten in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Mavacamten is suspected to cause embryo-foetal toxicity when 
administered during pregnancy. Therefore, CAMZYOS is contraindicated during pregnancy (see 
section 4.3). CAMZYOS should be stopped 6 months before planning a pregnancy (see section 4.4). If 
a patient becomes pregnant, mavacamten must be discontinued. Medical advice should be given 
regarding the risk of harmful effects to the foetus associated with treatment and ultrasonography 
examinations should be performed. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether mavacamten or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. There is no 
information on the excretion of mavacamten or its metabolites in animal milk (see section 5.3). 
Because of the unknown adverse effects of mavacamten in breastfed newborns/infants, women must 
not breast-feed during treatment with mavacamten. 
Fertility 
No human fertility data on mavacamten are available. Studies in animals are insufficient with respect 
to male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Mavacamten has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur during 
use of mavacamten. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience 
dizziness. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions with mavacamten are dizziness (17%), dyspnoea 
(12%), systolic dysfunction (5%) and syncope (5%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported in patients treated with mavacamten in two phase 3 studies are tabulated 
below. A total of 179 patients received a daily dose of either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg of 
mavacamten. The median treatment duration for patients receiving mavacamten was 30.1 weeks 
(range: 1.6 to 40.3 weeks).

The adverse reactions included in table 3 are listed according to system organ class in MedDRA. 
Within each system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency 
and seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is defined 
as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare (< 1/10 000).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Systolic dysfunction 
In Phase 3 clinical studies, 5% (9/179) of patients in the mavacamten group experienced reversible 
reductions in LVEF < 50% (median 45%: range: 35-49%) while on treatment. In 56% (5/9) of these 
patients, reductions were observed without other clinical manifestations. In all patients treated with 
mavacamten, LVEF recovered following interruption of mavacamten and they completed the study on 
treatment (see section 4.4). 
Dyspnoea 
In Phase 3 clinical studies, dyspnoea was reported in 12.3% of patients treated with mavacamten 
compared to 8.7% of patients on placebo. In the EXPLORER-HCM study, most (67%) of the 
dyspnoea events were reported after mavacamten was discontinued, with median time to onset of 
2 weeks (range: 0.1-4.9) after last dose. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Human experience of overdose with mavacamten is limited. Mavacamten has been given as a single 
dose of up to 144 mg in patients with HCM. There was one serious adverse reaction of vasovagal 
reaction, hypotension, and asystole lasting 38 seconds reported at that dose. In healthy subjects, doses 
of up to 25 mg have been administered for up to 25 days. A reduction of LVEF by 20% or greater was 
experienced in 3 out of 8 participants treated at the 25 mg dose level. Systolic dysfunction is the most 
likely result of overdose of mavacamten. If warranted, treatment of overdose with mavacamten 
consists of discontinuation of mavacamten treatment as well as medically supportive measures to 
maintain hemodynamic status (e.g. initiation of inotropic support with adrenergic agents), including 
close monitoring of vital signs and LVEF and management of the clinical status of the patient. Early 
administration of activated charcoal may be considered in case of mavacamten overdose to reduce 
absorption. This recommendation is based on standard treatment of medicinal product overdose, as the 
use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption of mavacamten has not been specifically studied.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Cardiac therapy, Other cardiac preparations, ATC code: C01EB24 
Mechanism of action 
Mavacamten is a selective, allosteric, and reversible cardiac myosin inhibitor. Mavacamten modulates 
the number of myosin heads that can enter power-generating states, thus reducing (or in HCM 
normalizing) the probability of force-producing systolic and residual diastolic cross-bridge formation. 
Mavacamten also shifts the overall myosin population towards an energy-sparing, but recruitable, 
super-relaxed state. Excess cross-bridge formation and dysregulation of the super-relaxed state of 
myosin are mechanistic hallmarks of HCM, which can result in hyper-contractility, impaired 
relaxation, excess energy consumption, and myocardial wall stress. In HCM patients, cardiac myosin 
inhibition with mavacamten normalises contractility, reduces dynamic LVOT obstruction, and 
improves cardiac filling pressures. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
LVEF 
In the EXPLORER-HCM study, mean (SD) resting LVEF was 74% (6) at baseline in both treatment 
arms, reductions in mean absolute change from baseline in LVEF was -4% (95% CI: -5.3, -2.5) in the 
mavacamten arm and 0% (95% CI: -1.2, 1.0) in the placebo arm over the 30-week treatment period. At 
Week 38, following an 8-week interruption of mavacamten, mean LVEF was similar to baseline for 
both treatment arms. 
LVOT obstruction 
In the EXPLORER-HCM study, patients achieved reductions in mean resting and provoked (Valsalva) 
LVOT gradient by week 4 which were sustained throughout the 30-week study duration. At week 30, 
the mean change from baseline in resting and Valsalva LVOT gradients were -39 (95% CI: -44.0, 
-33.2) mmHg and -49 (95% CI: -55.4, -43.0) mmHg, respectively, for mavacamten arm and 
-6 (95% CI: -10.5, -0.5) mmHg and -12 (95% CI: -17.6, -6.6) mmHg, respectively, for the placebo 
arm. At week 38, following 8 weeks of mavacamten washout, mean LVEF and LVOT gradients were 
similar to baseline for both treatment arms. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
In HCM, the QT interval may be intrinsically prolonged due to the underlying disease, in association 
with ventricular pacing, or in association with medicinal products with potential for QT prolongation 
commonly used in the HCM population. An exposure-response analysis across all clinical studies in 
HCM patients has shown a concentration-dependent shortening of the QTcF interval with 
mavacamten. The mean placebo corrected change from baseline in oHCM patients was -8.7 ms (upper 
and lower limit of the 90% CI -6.7 ms and -10.8 ms, respectively) at the median steady-state Cmax of 
452 ng/mL. Patients with longer baseline QTcF intervals tended to display the greatest shortening. 
Consistent with nonclinical findings in normal hearts, in one clinical study in healthy subjects 
sustained exposure to mavacamten at supratherapeutic levels leading to marked depression of systolic 
function was associated with QTc prolongation (< 20 ms). No acute QTc changes have been observed 
at comparable (or higher) exposures after single doses. The findings in healthy hearts are attributed to 
an adaptive response to the cardiac mechanical/functional changes (marked mechanical LV 
depression) occurring in response to myosin inhibition in hearts with normal physiology and LV 
contractility.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
EXPLORER-HCM 
The efficacy of mavacamten was evaluated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-arm, multicentre, international, Phase 3 study enrolling 251 adult patients with NYHA class II 
and III oHCM, LVEF ≥ 55%, and LVOT peak gradient ≥ 50 mmHg at rest or with provocation at time 
of oHCM diagnosis and Valsalva LVOT gradient ≥ 30 mmHg at screening. The majority of patients 
received background HCM treatment for a total of 96% in mavacamten arm (beta blockers 76%, 
calcium channel blockers 20%) and of 87% in the placebo arm (beta blockers 74%, calcium channel 
blockers 13%). 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a starting dose of 5 mg of mavacamten 
(123 patients) or matching placebo (128 patients) once daily for 30 weeks. The dose was periodically 
adjusted to optimise patients’ response (decrease in LVOT gradient with Valsalva manoeuvre), 
maintain LVEF ≥ 50%, and was also guided by plasma concentrations of mavacamten. Within the 
dose range of 2.5 mg to 15 mg, a total of 60 patients received 5 mg and 40 patients received 10 mg. 
During the study, 3 of 7 patients on mavacamten had LVEF < 50% prior to the week 30 visit and 
temporarily interrupted their dose; 2 patients resumed treatment at the same dose and 1 patient had the 
dose reduced from 10 mg to 5 mg. 
Treatment assignment was stratified by baseline NYHA class (II or III), current treatment with beta 
blockers (yes or no), and type of ergometer (treadmill or exercise bicycle) used for assessment of peak 
oxygen consumption (pVO2). Patients on background dual treatment with beta blocker and calcium 
channel blocker treatment or disopyramide or ranolazine were excluded. Patients with known 
infiltrative or storage disorder causing cardiac hypertrophy that mimicked oHCM, such as Fabry 
disease, amyloidosis, or Noonan syndrome with LV hypertrophy, were also excluded. 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between mavacamten and 
placebo. The mean age was 59 years, 54% (mavacamten) vs 65% (placebo) were male, mean body 
mass index (BMI) was 30 kg/m2, mean heart rate 63 bpm, mean blood pressure 128/76 mmHg, and 
90% were Caucasian. At baseline, approximately 73% of randomised subjects were NYHA class II 
and 27% were NYHA class III. The mean LVEF was 74%, and the mean Valsalva LVOT was 
73 mmHg. 8% had prior septal reduction therapy, 75% were on beta -blockers, 17% were on calcium 
channel blockers, 14% had history of atrial fibrillation, and 23% with implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator (23%). In EXPLORER-HCM there were 85 patients aged 65 years or older, 45 patients 
were dosed with mavacamten. 
The primary outcome measure included a change at week 30 in exercise capacity measured by pVO2 
and symptoms measured by NYHA functional classification, defined as an improvement of pVO2 by 
≥ 1.5 mL/kg/min and an improvement in NYHA class by at least 1 OR an improvement of pVO2 
by ≥ 3.0 mL/kg/min and no worsening in NYHA class. 
A greater proportion of patients treated with mavacamten met the primary and secondary endpoints at 
week 30 compared to placebo (see table 4).

† KCCQ-23 CSS = Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-23 Clinical Summary Score. The 
KCCQ-23 CSS is derived from the Total Symptoms Score (TSS) and the Physical Limitations (PL) score of the 
KCCQ-23. The CSS ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better health status. A significant 
treatment effect on the KCCQ-23 CSS favouring mavacamten was first observed at week 6 and remained 
consistent through week 30. 
‡ HCMSQ SoB = Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Symptom Questionnaire Shortness of Breath. The 
HCMSQ SoB domain score measures frequency and severity of shortness of breath. The HCMSQ SoB domain 
score ranges from 0 to 18, with lower scores representing less shortness of breath. A significant treatment effect 
on the HCMSQ SoB favouring mavacamten was first observed at week 4 and remained consistent through 
week 30. 
A range of demographic characteristics, baseline disease characteristics, and baseline concomitant 
medicinal products were examined for their influence on outcomes. Results of the primary analysis 
consistently favoured mavacamten across all subgroups analysed. 
VALOR-HCM 
The efficacy of mavacamten was evaluated in a Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, 16-week 
placebo-controlled trial in 112 patients with symptomatic oHCM who were septal reduction therapy 
(SRT) eligible. Patients with severely symptomatic drug-refractory oHCM, and NYHA class III/IV or 
class II with exertional syncope or near syncope were included in the study. Patients were required to 
have LVOT peak gradient ≥ 50 mmHg at rest or with provocation, and LVEF ≥ 60%. Patients must 
have been referred or under active consideration within the past 12 months for SRT and had been 
actively considering scheduling the procedure. 
17 
 
 
 
 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive treatment with mavacamten or placebo once daily. The dose 
was periodically adjusted within the dose range of 2.5 mg to 15 mg to optimise patient’s response. 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between mavacamten and 
placebo. The mean age was 60.3 years, 51% were male, mean BMI was 31 kg/m2, mean heart rate 
64 bpm, mean blood pressure 131/74 mmHg, and 89% were Caucasian. At baseline, approximately 
7% of randomised subjects were NYHA class II and 92% were NYHA class III. 46% were on 
beta-blockers monotherapy, 15% were on calcium channel blockers monotherapy, 33% were on a 
mixed combination of beta -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and 20% were on disopyramide alone 
or in combination with other treatment. In VALOR-HCM there were 45 patients aged 65 years or 
older, 24 patients were dosed with mavacamten. 
Mavacamten was shown to be superior to placebo in meeting the primary composite endpoint at 
week 16 (see table 5). The primary endpoint was a composite of 
 
 
patient decision to proceed with SRT prior to or at week 16 or 
patients who remain SRT eligible (LVOT gradient of ≥ 50 mmHg and NYHA class III-IV, or 
class II with exertional syncope or near syncope) at week 16. 
The treatment effects of mavacamten on LVOT obstruction, functional capacity, health status, and 
cardiac biomarkers were assessed by change from baseline through week 16 in post-exercise LVOT 
gradient, proportion of patients with improvement in NYHA class, KCCQ-23 CSS, NT-proBNP, and 
cardiac troponin I. In the VALOR-HCM study, hierarchical testing of secondary efficacy endpoints 
showed significant improvement in the mavacamten group compared to the placebo group (table 5).

In the VALOR-HCM study, secondary endpoint of NT-proBNP, at week 16 (see table 5) showed a 
sustained reduction from baseline after mavacamten treatment compared to placebo that was similar to 
that seen in EXPLORER-HCM at week 30. 
Exploratory analysis of left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and left atrial volume index (LAVI) 
showed reductions in the mavacamten treated patients compared to placebo in EXPLORER-HCM and 
VALOR-HCM. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
CAMZYOS in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of HCM (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Mavacamten is readily absorbed with a median tmax of 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 3 hours) after oral 
administration with an estimated oral bioavailability of approximately 85% within the clinical dose 
range. The increase in mavacamten exposure is generally dose proportional after once daily doses of 
mavacamten (2 mg to 48 mg). 
After a single dose of 15 mg mavacamten, Cmax and AUCinf are 47% and 241% higher, respectively, in 
CYP2C19 poor metabolisers compared to normal metabolisers. Mean half-life is prolonged in 
CYP2C19 poor metabolisers compared to normal metabolisers (23 days versus 6 to 9 days, 
respectively). 
Inter-subject PK variability is moderate, with a coefficient of variation for exposure of 
approximately 30-50% for Cmax and AUC. 
A high fat, high calorie meal delayed absorption resulting in a median tmax of 4 hours (range: 0.5 to 
8 hours) in the fed state compared to 1 h in the fasted state. Administration with meals resulted in a 
12% decrease in AUC0-inf, however this decrease is not considered clinically significant. Mavacamten 
may be administered with or without meals. 
As mavacamten is titrated based on clinical response (see section 4.2), simulated steady state 
exposures are summarized using individualised dosage by phenotype (table 6).

Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of mavacamten is 97-98% in clinical studies. The blood-to-plasma 
concentration ratio is 0.79. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) ranged from 114 L to 206 L. 
Specific studies to assess distribution of mavacamten have not been conducted in humans, however 
data are consistent with a high volume of distribution. 
Based upon 10 male subjects dosed for up to 28 days, the amount of mavacamten distributed to the 
semen was considered to be low. 
Biotransformation 
Mavacamten is extensively metabolised, primarily through CYP2C19 (74%), CYP3A4 (18%), and 
CYP2C9 (7.6%) based on in-vitro reaction phenotyping. Metabolism is expected to be driven through 
all three pathways, and primarily through CYP2C19 in CYP2C19 intermediate, normal, rapid and 
ultra-rapid metabolisers. Three metabolites have been detected in human plasma. The exposure of the 
most abundant metabolite MYK-1078 in human plasma was less than 4% of the exposure of 
mavacamten, and the other two metabolites had exposures less than 3% of the exposure of 
mavacamten indicating these would have minimal to no impact on the overall activity of mavacamten. 
In CYP2C19 poor metabolisers mavacamten is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4. No data are 
available on the metabolite profile in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers. 
Effect of mavacamten on other CYP enzymes 
Based on pre-clinical data, for a dose up to 5 mg in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers and for a dose up to 
15 mg in CYP2C19 intermediate to ultra-rapid metabolisers, mavacamten is not an inhibitor of CYP 
1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Effect of mavacamten on transporters 
In vitro data indicate that mavacamten is not an inhibitor of major efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, 
BSEP, MATE1, or MATE2-K) or major uptake transporters (organic anion transporting polypeptides 
[OATPs], organic cation transporters [OCTs], or organic anion transporters [OATs]) at therapeutic 
concentrations for a dose up to 5 mg in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers and for a dose up to 15 mg in 
CYP2C19 intermediate to ultra-rapid metabolisers. 
Elimination 
Mavacamten is cleared from plasma primarily by metabolism through cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Terminal half-life is 6 to 9 days in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers and 23 days for CYP2C19 poor 
metabolisers. 
Half-life is estimated to be, 6 days for CYP2C19 ultra-rapid metabolisers, 8 days for CYP2C19 rapid 
metabolisers, and 10 days for CYP2C19 intermediate metabolisers. 
Drug accumulation occurs with an accumulation ratio about 2-fold for Cmax and about 7-fold for AUC 
in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers. The accumulation depends on the metabolism status for CYP2C19 
with the largest accumulation observed in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers. At steady-state, the 
peak-to-trough plasma concentration ratio with once daily dosing is approximately 1.5. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following a single 25 mg dose of 14C labelled mavacamten in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers, 7% and 
85% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the faeces and urine of CYP2C19 normal metabolisers, 
respectively. Unchanged active substance accounted for approximately 1% and 3% of the 
administered dose in the faeces and urine, respectively. 
CYP2C19 phenotype 
Polymorphic CYP2C19 is the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of mavacamten. An individual 
carrying two normal function alleles is a CYP2C19 normal metaboliser (e.g., *1/*1). An individual 
carrying two non-functional alleles is a CYP2C19 poor metaboliser (e.g., *2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3). 
The incidence of CYP2C19 poor metaboliser phenotype ranges from approximately 2% in Caucasian 
to 18% in Asian populations. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Exposure to mavacamten increased approximately dose proportionally between 2 mg and 48 mg and is 
expected to result in dose proportional exposure increase across the therapeutic range of 2.5 mg to 
5 mg in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers and 2.5 mg to 15 mg in CYP2C19 intermediate to ultra-rapid 
metabolisers. 
Special populations 
No clinically significant differences in the PK of mavacamten were observed using population PK 
modelling based on age, sex, race or ethnicity. 
Hepatic impairment 
A single dose PK study was conducted in patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate 
(Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment, as well as a control group with normal hepatic function. 
Mavacamten exposures (AUC) increased 3.2-fold and 1.8-fold in patients with mild and moderate 
impairment, respectively, compared to patients with normal hepatic function. There was no effect of 
hepatic function on Cmax, consistent with no change in the rate of absorption and/or volume of 
distribution. The amount of mavacamten excreted in urine in all 3 studied groups was 3%. A dedicated 
PK study has not been conducted in patients with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
Approximately 3% of a mavacamten dose is excreted in the urine as parent substance. A population 
PK analysis, which comprised eGFR down to 29.5 mL/min/1.73m2, demonstrated no correlation 
between renal function and exposure. A dedicated PK study has not been conducted in patients with 
severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. Toxicology findings 
were generally related to adverse reductions on cardiac function consistent with exaggerated primary 
pharmacology in healthy animals. These effects occurred at clinically relevant exposures. 
Reproductive toxicity and fertility 
In reproductive toxicity studies, there was no evidence of effects of mavacamten on mating and 
fertility in male or female rats or in the viability and fertility of offspring of dams at any dose tested. 
However, plasma exposures (AUC) of mavacamten at the highest doses tested were less than in 
humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). 
Embryo-foetal and postnatal development 
Mavacamten adversely affected embryo-foetal development in rats and rabbits. When mavacamten 
was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, decreased mean foetal 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
body weight, increases in post implantation loss, and foetal malformations (visceral and skeletal) were 
observed at clinically relevant exposures. Visceral malformations involved heart malformation in 
foetuses, including one total situs inversus, while skeletal malformations were manifested mostly as 
increased incidences of fused sternebrae. 
When mavacamten was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, 
visceral and skeletal malformations were noted, consisting of malformations of the great vessels 
(dilatation of pulmonary trunk and/or aortic arch), cleft palate and higher incidences of fused 
sternebrae. Maternal plasma exposure levels (AUC) at the no effect dose level for embryo-foetal 
development in both species were less than those in humans at the MRHD. 
In a pre- and post-natal development study, administration of mavacamten to pregnant rats from 
gestation day 6 to lactation/post-partum day 20 did not result in adverse effects in the dams or 
offspring exposed daily from before birth (in utero) through lactation. The maternal exposure was less 
than the MRHD. No information is available on the excretion of mavacamten in animal milk.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What CAMZYOS is and what it is used for 
What CAMZYOS is 
CAMZYOS contains the active substance mavacamten. Mavacamten is a reversible cardiac myosin 
inhibitor, meaning that it changes the action of the muscle protein myosin in heart muscle cells. 
What CAMZYOS is used for 
CAMZYOS is used to treat adults with a type of heart disease called obstructive hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (oHCM). 
About obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition where the walls of the left heart chamber 
(ventricle) contract harder and become thicker than normal. As the walls thicken they can block 
(obstruct) the flow of blood out of the heart and can also make the heart stiff. This obstruction makes it 
more difficult for blood to flow into and out of the heart and be pumped to the body with each 
heartbeat, a condition known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM). Symptoms of 
oHCM are: chest pain and shortness of breath (especially with physical exercise); tiredness, abnormal 
heart rhythms, dizziness, feeling that you are about to faint, fainting (syncope) and swelling of the 
ankles, feet, legs, abdomen and/or veins in the neck. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How CAMZYOS works 
CAMZYOS works by reducing excess contraction of the heart and the obstruction to blood flow to the 
body. As a result, it may improve your symptoms and your ability to be active. 
2.  What you need to know before you take CAMZYOS 
Do not take CAMZYOS if: 
 
 
 
you are allergic to mavacamten or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
you are pregnant or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. 
if you are taking medicines which may increase the level of CAMZYOS in your blood such as: 
- 
oral medicines to treat fungal infections such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, 
posaconazole, voriconazole, 
certain medicines to treat bacterial infections such as the antibiotics clarithromycin, 
certain medicines to treat HIV infection such as cobicistat, ritonavir, 
certain medicines to treat cancer such as ceritinib, idelalisib, tucatinib. 
Ask your doctor if the medicine you are taking prevents you from taking mavacamten. See section 
“Other medicines and CAMZYOS” 
- 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Routine tests 
Your doctor will assess how well your heart is working (your heart function) using an echocardiogram 
(an ultrasound test that takes images of your heart) before your first dose and regularly during 
treatment with CAMZYOS. It is very important to keep these echocardiogram appointments, because 
your doctor needs to check the effect of CAMZYOS on your heart. Your treatment dose may need to 
be adjusted to improve your response or to reduce side effects. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant your doctor may perform a pregnancy test before 
starting treatment with CAMZYOS. 
Your doctor may do a test to check how this medicine is broken down (metabolised) in your body as 
this may be used to guide your CAMZYOS treatment (see section 3). 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist straight away: 
 
new or worsening shortness of breath, 
chest pain, 
tiredness, 
palpitations (a forceful heartbeat that may be rapid or irregular), or 
leg swelling. 
if you get any of these symptoms during your treatment with CAMZYOS: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
These could be signs and symptoms of systolic dysfunction, a condition where the heart cannot 
pump with enough force, which can be life-threatening and lead to heart failure. 
if you develop a serious infection or irregular heart beat (arrhythmia) as this could increase your 
risk of developing heart failure. 
 
Your doctor may need to do additional tests of your heart function, interrupt the treatment or change 
your dose, depending on how you feel. 
Women of childbearing potential 
If used during pregnancy, CAMZYOS can harm the unborn baby. Before you start treatment with 
CAMZYOS your doctor will explain the risk to you and ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to 
ensure that you are not pregnant. Your doctor will give you a card which explains why you should not 
become pregnant while taking CAMZYOS. It also explains what you should do to avoid becoming 
pregnant while you are taking CAMZYOS. You must use effective contraception during treatment and 
for 6 months after stopping treatment (see section “Pregnancy and breastfeeding”). 
If you do become pregnant while taking CAMZYOS, tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor will 
stop treatment (see “If you stop taking CAMZYOS” in section 3). 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children (aged below 18 years) because the effectiveness and safety of 
CAMZYOS have not been studied in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and CAMZYOS 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because some other medicines can affect the way CAMZYOS works. 
Some medicines can increase the amount of CAMZYOS in your body and make it more likely for you 
to get side effects that may be severe. Other medicines can reduce the amount of CAMZYOS in your 
body and may reduce its beneficial effects. 
In particular, before taking CAMZYOS tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently 
taken, or have changed the dose of any of the following medicines: 
 
some medicines used to reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces (cimetidine, 
omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole) 
antibiotics for bacterial infections (such as clarithromycin, erythromycin) 
medicines used to treat fungal infections (such as itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, 
posaconazole and voriconazole) 
medicines used to treat depression (such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram) 
medicines for HIV infections (such as ritonavir, cobicistat, efavirenz) 
rifampicin (an antibiotic for bacterial infections like tuberculosis) 
apalutamide, enzalutamide, mitotane, ceritinib, idelalisib, ribociclib, tucatinib (medicines used 
to treat certain types of cancer) 
medicines for fits (seizures) or epilepsy (such as carbamazepine and phenytoin, phenobarbital, 
primidone) 
St. John’s wort (a herbal medicine for depression) 
medicines that affect your heart (such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers e.g. 
verapamil and diltiazem) 
medicines that make your heart more resistant to abnormal activity (such as sodium channel 
blockers e.g. disopyramide) 
ticlopidine (a medicine to prevent heart attack and stroke) 
letermovir (a medicine to treat cytomegalovirus infections) 
norethindrone (a medicine to treat various menstrual problems) 
prednisone (steroid).

If you take or have taken any of these medicines, or have changed the dose, your doctor needs to 
closely monitor you, may need to change your dose of CAMZYOS, or consider alternative treatments. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking any of the medicines mentioned above, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking CAMZYOS. Before stopping or changing the dose of a medicine or starting 
a new medicine, tell your doctor or pharmacist. 
Do not take any of the above medicines occasionally or once in a while (not on a regular schedule) 
since that could change the amount of CAMZYOS in your body. 
CAMZYOS with food and drink 
You should use caution when drinking grapefruit juice while on treatment with CAMZYOS as it may 
change the amount of CAMZYOS in your body. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Pregnancy 
Do not take CAMZYOS during pregnancy, for 6 months before getting pregnant, or if you are a 
woman who could become pregnant and you are not using effective contraception. CAMZYOS may 
cause harm to your unborn baby. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, your doctor will 
inform you about this risk and will check if you are pregnant before starting treatment and regularly 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
during treatment. Your doctor will give you a card which explains why you should not become 
pregnant while taking CAMZYOS. If you become pregnant, think you may be pregnant or planning to 
become pregnant while taking CAMZYOS, tell your doctor right away. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known if CAMZYOS passes through breastmilk. You must not breast-feed while taking 
CAMZYOS. 
Driving and using machines 
Mavacamten may have a small effect on your ability to drive and use machines. If you feel dizzy 
while taking this medicine, do not drive a vehicle, cycle or use any tools or machines. 
CAMZYOS contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take CAMZYOS 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
How much to take 
The recommended starting dose is 2.5 mg or 5 mg taken by mouth once daily. Your doctor may do a 
test to check how this medicine is broken down (metabolised) in your body. The result may guide your 
CAMZYOS treatment. If you have liver problems, your doctor may also prescribe a reduced starting 
dose. 
Your doctor will monitor how well your heart is working while you are taking CAMZYOS using 
echocardiograms and may change your dose (increase, lower, or temporarily stop) based on the 
results. 
Your doctor will tell you how much CAMZYOS to take. 
Your doctor will prescribe you a single daily dose of either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg. The 
maximum single dose is 15 mg once daily. You must only take one capsule each day for the dose your 
doctor has prescribed to ensure that you receive the correct amount of CAMZYOS. 
Always take CAMZYOS as prescribed by your doctor. 
The first echocardiogram will be done before you start treatment, and then again during follow-up 
visits at week 4, 8 and 12 to assess your response to CAMZYOS. Routine echocardiograms will then 
be done every 12 weeks. If your doctor changes your dose of CAMZYOS at any point, an 
echocardiogram will be done 4 weeks afterwards to make sure you are receiving a beneficial dose. 
Taking this medicine 
 
 
Swallow the capsule whole with a glass of water at about the same time each day. 
You can take the medicine with food or between meals. 
If you take more CAMZYOS than you should 
If you take more capsules than you should, contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away if you 
have taken 3 to 5 times the recommended dose. If possible, take the medicine pack and this leaflet 
with you. 
If you forget to take CAMZYOS 
If you forget to take CAMZYOS at the usual time, take your dose as soon as you remember on the 
same day and take your next dose at the usual time the next day. Do not take a double dose to make up 
for a forgotten capsule. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you stop taking CAMZYOS 
Do not stop taking CAMZYOS unless your doctor tells you to. If you wish to stop taking CAMZYOS,

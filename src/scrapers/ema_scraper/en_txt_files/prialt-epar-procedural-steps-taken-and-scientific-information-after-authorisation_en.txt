1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

and/or address of a manufacturer/importer of the 
finished product, including quality control sites 
carefully with low initiation dose and slow titration using 
low dose increments in long intervals along with continuous 
monitoring of drug response. As the result, the SmPC was 
updated to introduce a reduced posology to allow dosing 
flexibility and meet individual patients’ needs in terms of 
analgesia and adverse events. Moreover, additional risk 
minimization measures were implemented in the SmPC/PIL 
due to serious adverse events, including suicide, that can 
also occur with low starting doses.

The CHMP adopted on 22 July 2010 an Opinion on the 
annual reassessment of Prialt. A new follow-up measure 
was agreed upon and the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
provided a revised Letter of Undertaking dated 9 July 2010 
detailing the specific obligation and follow-up measures 
remaining outstanding.

SmPC 
Based on the data that have become available since the 
granting of the marketing authorization under exceptional 
circumstances, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk 
balance of Prialt remains positive, but considers that its 
safety profile is to be closely monitored for the following 
reasons: 
There is one specific obligation outstanding, the PRIME 
study which is expected to generate relevant long-term 
safety and efficacy data on the product.  
The CHMP is also of the opinion that submission of yearly 
PSURs should continue until concerns identified in relation 
to the pharmacovigilance system are adequately 
addressed. 
Page 14/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit 
one additional renewal application in 5 years time.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder fulfilled the following 
(Post Marketing observational study to evaluate the long-
term efficacy and safety of Prialt). 
of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and 
section 4 of the Package Leaflet (PL) further to the 
fulfillment of the Follow-Up Measures (FUMs) 004, 
005 and 006. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
Follow-up Measures:  
- FUM 004: "To evaluate the potential development of 
hyperalgesia following IT administration of ziconotide in the 
controlled studies (95-001, 96-002 and 301)." 
- FUM 005: "To integrate the safety data from studies 301, 
302, 351 and 352 into the MAA safety data base, and to 
look at the adverse events in patients taking CNS active 
drugs." 
- FUM 006: "To provide efficacy and safety data on the 
ongoing long-term studies 351, 352 and 501, including the 
VASPI scores. To establish the correlations between dose 
increment intervals and efficacy and safety events." 
Further to the final report analysis on the clinical studies 
301, 302, 351, 352 and 501, the MAH applied for an 
update of the sections 4.8 of the SPC and 4 of the Package 
Leaflet to reflect the clinical data available on the 
evaluations of the potential development of hyperalgesia 
following IT administration of ziconotide in some controlled 
studies and of the efficacy and safety data on the ongoing 
long-term studies 351, 352 and 501; the sections 4.8 of 
the SPC and 4 of the PL were therefore amended according 
to the adverse event pattern reported in studies 302, 351, 
352 and 501.

took this opportunity to include the ATC code in the 
section 5.1 of the SPC, and to include minor linguistic

Package Leaflet.

formal intrathecal morphine-ziconotide clinical interaction 
studies (ELN92045-201, ELN92045-202) and submission of 
a variation to the SPC to account for conclusions from these 
studies." Further to the final report analysis on the long-
term extensions of both studies ELN92045-201 and 
ELN92045-202, the MAH applied for an update of the 
sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 of the SPC to reflect the clinical 
data available on concomitant use of IT opioids and IT 
ziconotide. The MAH also took this opportunity to include 
the ATC code in the section 5.1 of the SPC. Minor linguistic 
changes and punctuation errors in the Labelling and 
Package Leaflet were also made during this procedure.

characteristics of the active substance are well-defined and 
controlled, and the product is formulated, manufactured 
and controlled in a way that is characteristic for this new 
strength application. The specifications and batch analytical 
results indicate a consistent product with uniform clinical 
performance from batch to batch. The risk/benefit is 
considered acceptable since the proposed 25 µg/ml solution 
for infusion is better adapted to the dosing regime and 
eliminates the need for dilution prior to administration. 
Apart from the strength, the product is identical to the 
approved 100 µg/ml formulation.

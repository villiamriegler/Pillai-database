2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Rituximab is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds to cluster of 
differentiation 20 (CD20) protein, a hydrophobic transmembrane protein present on the cell surface 
of pre-B- and mature B-lymphocytes but not on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal 
plasma cells, or other normal tissue. In particular, CD20 is present on the malignant B-lymphocytes 
in the majority of patients with mature B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. The binding of rituximab 
to CD20 on B-lymphocytes eliminates these cells via a number of different possible mechanisms, 
including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and 
induction of apoptosis. 
MabThera (rituximab) received MA in EU in 1998 and is at present indicated in the treatment of NHL, 
CLL, and rheumatoid arthritis. The currently marketed formulation of rituximab is concentrate for 
solution for infusion (available as 100 mg/10 mL or 500 mg/50 mL single-use vials), and once the 
solution is prepared it is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 8/103 
 
 
  
  
 
The recommended dose of rituximab for adult patients in the approved NHL indications is 
375 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) per cycle as induction treatment either as monotherapy at 
weekly dosing intervals for 4 weeks or in combination with chemotherapy at dosing intervals every 
3 weeks for up to 8 cycles, and as maintenance treatment at 2- or 3-monthly dosing intervals for 2 
years. The recommended dose of rituximab for patients with CLL is 375 mg/m2 BSA at the first 
treatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 BSA at each subsequent cycle at intervals of 4 weeks, for a 
total of six cycles. To minimize the potential for infusion-related toxicity, it is recommended to 
premedicate patients with acetaminophen/paracetamol and an antihistamine before each infusion, 
and to initiate the infusions at a rate of 50 mg/h for the first infusion or 100 mg/h for subsequent 
infusions. In the absence of infusion-related toxicity, the rate can be increased steadily to a 
maximum rate of 400 mg/h, but in the case of infusion-related toxicity the infusion should be 
interrupted or the rate slowed. 
Based on these recommendations, the first infusion typically requires 4 − 6 hours and subsequent 
infusions require 2 − 4 hours. The first infusion is generally administered over a longer duration as 
a result of the risk of infusion-related toxicities, and some patients require even slower rates for this 
initial exposure. The second and subsequent infusions at the recommended infusion rate are 
generally well tolerated. 
The MAH hereby applied  to introduce a subcutaneous formulation in which rituximab has been 
concentrated 12-fold to 120 mg/mL with the addition of recombinant human hyaluronidase 
(rHuPH20) for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma 
in combination with chemotherapy; as a maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of 
follicular lymphoma patients responding to induction therapy; as monotherapy for treatment of 
patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or 
subsequent relapse after chemotherapy;  for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse 
large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy.  
Premedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and 
diphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of MabThera as specified in 
SmPC section 4.2. Premedication with glucocorticoids should be considered if MabThera is not given 
in combination with glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy for treatment of non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma. 
Administration is by a subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall over approximately 5 minutes. 
The recommended dose of MabThera subcutaneous formulation used for adult patients is a 
subcutaneous injection at a fixed dose of 1400 mg irrespective of the patient’s body surface area.  
Before starting MabThera subcutaneous injections, all patients must always receive beforehand, a 
full dose of MabThera by intravenous infusion, using MabThera intravenous formulation  
Combination therapy 
The recommended dose of MabThera in combination with chemotherapy for induction treatment of 
previously untreated or relapsed/ refractory patients with follicular lymphoma is: first cycle with 
MabThera intravenous formulation 375 mg/m2 body surface area, followed by subsequent cycles 
with MabThera subcutaneous formulation injected at a fixed dose of 1400 mg per cycle for up to 8 
cycles. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 9/103 
 
  
  
 
MabThera should be administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after administration of the 
glucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy if applicable. 
The posology was proposed as follows: 
Maintenance therapy 
• 
Previously untreated follicular lymphoma 
The recommended dose of MabThera subcutaneous formulation used as a maintenance treatment 
for patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction 
treatment is: 1400 mg once every 2 months (starting 2 months after the last dose of induction 
therapy) until disease progression or for a maximum period of two years. 
•  Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma 
The recommended dose of MabThera subcutaneous formulation used as a maintenance treatment 
for  patients  with  relapsed/refractory  follicular  lymphoma  who  have  responded  to  induction 
treatment is: 1400 mg once every 3 months (starting 3 months after the last dose of induction 
therapy) until disease progression or for a maximum period of two years.  
•  Monotherapy: Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma 
The proposed dose of MabThera monotherapy used as induction treatment for adult patients with 
stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent 
relapse after chemotherapy is: first cycle with MabThera intravenous formulation 375 mg/m2 body 
surface area, followed by subsequent cycles with MabThera subcutaneous formulation injected at a 
fixed dose of 1400 mg per cycle, once weekly. In total: 4 weeks. For retreatment with MabThera 
monotherapy for patients who have responded to previous treatment with MabThera monotherapy 
for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma using the subcutaneous formulation, the recommended 
dose is 1400 mg once weekly for four weeks. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
A new MabThera dosage form for subcutaneous injection has been developed (referred to as 
MabThera SC) and Roche is seeking approval for it with this Extension Application. The new SC 
formulation contains rHuPH20, a recombinant human hyaluronidase which enables the 
subcutaneous injection of large volumes and acts as a permeation enhancer.  
The complete composition of MabThera subcutaneous formulation is: 120 mg/mL rituximab in 
histidine/histidine hydrochloridetrehalose, polysorbate 80, L-methionine and rHuPH20. 
This line extension builds on the existing experience with rituximab drug substance. The 
manufacturing process for rituximab drug substance is, with one exception, identical between the 
currently approved rituximab IV process and the applied rituximab SC process.  
The SC formulation is concentrated to a higher protein content and buffer exchanged with another 
buffer in the final ultrafiltration/diafiltration step of the process.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 10/103 
 
 
  
  
 
Hyaluronidase (rhuPH20) is produced in CHO cells. rhuPH20 is a novel excipient and detailed 
information on the manufacture and control is presented in the dossier. However, rhuPH20 has 
been recently reviewed, as a novel excipient in the following procedure; Trastuzumab SC, 
EMEA/H/C/278/X/60. Trastuzumab SC is also marketed by Roche Registration Ltd. Manufacture 
and the manufacturing process for rhuPH20 at Avid is similar to the material to be used in 
Trastuzumab SC and MabThera SC. The Trastuzumab SC procedure received a CD in 2013.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody representing a 
glycosylated immunoglobulin with human IgG1 constant regions and murine light-chain and 
heavy-chain variable region sequences. The antibody is produced by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 
cell suspension culture and purified by affinity chromatography and ion exchange, including specific 
viral inactivation and removal procedures. 
Manufacture 
Manufacturers of the active substance 
The facility used for the cGMP manufacture and testing of Rituximab SC Drug Substance is listed 
below. The manufacturing site responsible for the rituximab SC manufacture (Vacaville) is already 
responsible for the manufacture of the currently approved rituximab IV.  
Genentech, Inc.

Vacaville, CA 95688 
USA  
Genentech, Inc. 
One Antibody Way                   
Oceanside, CA 92056 
USA 
The fermentation and harvest process of the rituximab SC manufacturing process is identical to the 
currently approved process for rituximab IV. 
The rituximab SC purification process is also identical to the purification process of rituximab IV, 
except for the final ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UFDF) step which has been modified to achieve a 
higher Drug Substance concentration (120 mg/mL) 
The raw materials that are new to the rituximab SC drug substance process, compared to the 
currently approved rituximab IV process, are; L-Histidine, L-Histidine Hydrochloride, Monohydrate, 
L-Methionine, α,α-Trehalose Dihydrate.  
The final formulation (except for the addition of rHuPH20) is made on the drug substance level and 
all the excipients comply with Ph Eur requirements. Certificate of analysis for all excipients in the 
formulation of drug substance is provided and demonstrates a satisfactorily low bioburden. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 11/103 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
Control of critical steps and intermediates in the rituximab SC drug substance manufacturing 
process is identical with the ones currently approved for Mabthera drug substance. No additional 
CPPs were identified for the rituximab SC UFDF step compared to the currently approved rituximab 
IV process. This is acceptable, given that the process step in its nature is unchanged.  
The applicant has provided adequate data to demonstrate process validation of the modified steps, 
i.e. the UFDF step and the changes in DS formulation. In addition, removal of impurities was 
re-assessed, and satisfactory information has been provided with regard to validation of the efficacy 
of the UFDF membrane cleaning procedures, UFDF filter leachables, and drug substance 
re-filtration. A maximum number of three re-filtrations is proposed. Refiltration to remove 
contaminants such as bioburden outside established limits or foreign matter is not permitted. 
The proposed hold times for the UFDF pool and diluted UFDF pool have been validated.  
Specification 
The proposed specification, the methods and the limits proposed for release of rituximab SC drug 
substance are partly based on the Rituximab IV process and is overall acceptable. A number of 
limits are changed due to formulation changes, i.e. colour, clarity, pH, content of polysorbate 
protein content and bacterial endotoxinsConsidering the highly concentrated protein solution, a 
separate specification for aggregates was requested and has been introduced.  
The same reference standards are used as for analysing rituximab IV. 
Stability 
The stability data submitted support a 24 months shelf-life when stored at –20°C.  
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
The analytical comparability program of rituximab SC drug substance encompasses both the 
currently licensed release assays as well as extended characterization methods These studies 
sufficiently demonstrate that rituximab SC have analytical characteristics that are highly 
comparable to rituximab DS manufactured by the IV process. The level of impurities in rituximab SC 
DS and rituximab IV DS are essentially comparable or below the detection limitHowever, the 
residual amount is well below the acceptance level that is based on a safety risk assessment.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
The complete composition of MabThera subcutaneous formulation is: 120 mg/mL rituximab 
inL-histidine/histidine hydrochloride, trehalose, polysorbate 80, L-methionine, and rHuPH20. One 
vial of the final product contains 1400 mg of rituximab in 11.7 ml solution (120 mg/mL) 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The development of this subcutaneous formulation uses a new technology based on an excipient, 
recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), which acts as permeation enhancer, allowing larger 
volumes to be comfortably administered via the SC route. While the intravenous infusions typically 
require 2-4 hours, the subcutaneous formulation injections into the abdominal region will take 
approximately 5 to 7 minutes to administer. Recombinant rHuPH20 is considered a novel excipient 
Assessment report

(conform to a recent trastuzumab application) and the applicant has also provided a full dossier with 
details of manufacture, characterisation and control, accordingly. 
The objective of the formulation development program was to develop a stable high concentrated 
liquid formulation for the subcutaneous administration of rituximab. A step-wise approach was used 
for formulation development as it started by a formulation screening study followed by a stability 
study with selected formulation candidates and a formulation robustness study.  
The choice and concentrations of the excipients has been adequately justified by extensive 
formulation studies.  
The overall manufacturing process of the clinical lots is similar to the commercial process; only the 
formulation process differs in material and size of the compounding vessel and size of the receiving 
vessel. Batch analysis data of the clinical and commercial batches are provided and show that these 
materials are comparable.  
Data from characterization studies demonstrate that the presence of rHuPH20 in MabThera SC 
formulation has no impact on rituximab quality. 
Adventitious agents 
The rituximab IV adventitious agent controls and virus validation studies are also applicable to 
rituximab SC as the upstream manufacturing process is identical as well as the recovery steps used 
to purify and formulate rituximab with the exception of the UFDF step (no claimed virus reduction). 
The provided TSE information is reassuring.  
Manufacture of the product 
Manufacturer responsible for batch release 
Hoffmann - La Roche AG 
Emil-Barrell-Strasse 1 
D-79639 Grenzach-Wyhlen 
Germany 
The manufacturing process consists of thawing rituximab SC and hyaluronidase, mixing and sterile 
filtration and filling. Pooling of thawed rituximab bulks from multiple active substance storage 
containers is performed into a sterilized mixing/compounding vessel in order to yield the required 
batch size for the fill process. Subsequently to the transfer in the mixing/compounding vessel, the 
rituximab bulk solution is homogenized by stirring. The rHuPH20 solution is slowly poured into the 
compounding vessel to the rituximab bulk solution and mixed further to obtain a homogenized 
formulated MabThera SC finished product bulk solution.  
Following bioburden reduction filtration, the formulated MabThera SC bulk solution is transferred 
into a steam sterilized receiving/transport vessel. The bioburden reduction filtration is performed 
with steam sterilized membrane filters. The resulting filtered finished product bulk solution is 
submitted to the final sterile filtration prior to filling into vials.  
The process validation data presented in the dossier suggest that the Mabthera SC drug product 
manufacturing process is well controlled and consistent.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 13/103 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
The need for up to three freeze/thaw cycles of the rituximab SC Drug Substance bulk and the 
rHuPH20 bulk for manufacturing the final bulk solution has been justified. 
Product specification 
The proposed specifications and methods are partly based on the Rituximab IV process.. The new  
methods are described in sufficient detail and adequate system suitability criteria and validation 
data have been presented. By request a separate specification for aggregates has been introduced 
and a number of limits has been tightened and are now in line with the batch analysis data of the 
clinical lots, process capability and analytical method variation.  
The same reference material is used in the analytical testing of rituximab SC Drug Substance and 
MabThera SC Drug Product. This reference material is also used for rituximab IV. For testing of the 
rHuPH20 activity in MabThera SC Drug Product the same reference standard is used as for the 
recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) analytics. 
Stability of the product 
The primary packaging consist of a 15 mL colorless USP/Ph. Eur., Type I glass vial, sealed with a 
butyl rubber stopper laminated with fluoro-resin film, and crimped with an aluminum overseal fitted 
with a plastic flip-off disk . Satisfactory information has been provided on the primary packaging 
materials. They are of standard quality, suited for packaging sterile-liquid products and comply with 
relevant pharmacopeia requirements.  
Based on the stability data provided a shelf-life of 30 months when stored at 2-8°C is acceptable for 
Mabthera SC drug product.  
Novel excipient: recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) 
The rHuPH20 degrades hyaluronan under physiological conditions and acts as a spreading factor in 
vivo. Thus, when combined or co-formulated with certain injectable drugs, rHuPH20 facilitates the 
absorption and dispersion of these drugs by temporarily clearing a path through the connective 
tissue in the subcutaneous space.  
Recombinant human hyaluronidase is a glycosylated single chain protein with up to 447 amino 
acids.  
Manufacture  
Overall, description of the upstream (cell expansion and main fermentation) and downstream 
process (solvent/detergent, four column purifications, nanofiltration and filling) is given and IPCs 
stated. The steps, control parameters, test methods used for control, and acceptance criteria are 
indicated.  
Detailed information about inoculum expansion, bioreactor operation and harvesting processes and 
the respective in-process controls are provided. Description of the single steps of the purification 
process is given. Respective maximum hold times are defined. Information about buffer volumes, 
flow rates, in process controls, maximum target mass, and collection mode is sufficient. The 
acceptance criteria for in-process controls are considered acceptable. Lists for the major equipment 
used during purification, chemical composition, sterilization method and equipment are provided. 
All equipment except for the viral inactivation tank and chromatography columns is single use. Each 
step in the filling, storage, and shipping steps is described adequately, along with in-process 
controls and tests that are monitored.

The specifications for the raw materials used for the fermentation, purification, and the bulk 
formulation process are provided. Description of the generation of the host cell line and the cell 
banking system is in line with the demands of the ICH guidelines Q5B, Q5D and CHMP 3AB1A. 
Critical parameters were defined based on the ICH Q7A definition of a process step, process 
condition, test requirement, or other relevant parameter or item that must be controlled within 
pre-determined criteria (operating range) to ensure that the rHuPH20 meets its specification. The 
critical controls and the numerical limits are considered acceptable.  
The process validation protocol was developed based upon the expectation as defined by the 
“Guidance for Industry: Process Validation”. The rHuPH20 lots were manufactured under Good 
Manufacturing Practices.  
The process was validated at full commercial scale with a five batch campaign. All five consecutive 
runs met the requirements for conformance with regard to run-to-run process performance and 
product quality attributes, as defined in the process qualification (PQ) protocol. The data confirmed 
that the process is robust and in a state of control. Information concerning general properties of the 
IMP, Manufacturing Process, Process Controls and specifications are in agreement with the 
demands of the guideline ICH Q6B.  
The  current  manufacturing  process  of  rHuPH20  was  developed  using  an  amplified  cell  line.  The 
generation  of  the  host  cell  line  and  the  cell  banking  system  is  described  in  satisfactory  detail. 
Comprehensive  information  on  the  cloning  and  establishment  of  the  MCB  and  WCB  has  been 
provided.  The  MAH  has  adequately  characterised  the  MCB,  WCB  and  EoP  cells  for  phenotype, 
genotype  and  safety.  The  applicant  has  also  calculated  the  total  number  of  generation  required 
between MCB and EoP cells and shown that this is within the in vitro cell age as calculated in small 
scale stability studies with extended MCB passaging.  
Detailed biophysical and biochemical characterization of seven HUB batches using state-of-the-art 
methods is provided.  
Impurities present in rHuPH20 purified bulk may result from product related impurities, process 
related impurities or microbiological impurities. Process related impurities are eliminated 
throughout the manufacturing process to an acceptable low level. 
Specification  
The specification for hyaluronidase has been suitably justified and is supported by consistent data 
from multiple lots. The specification contains tests for pharmacopoeial methods as well as specific 
methods to ensure safety and quality with respect to identity, purity, quantity, potency.  
The proposed specification for rHuPH20 is considered adequate to confirm the high quality of the 
excipient. Validation of analytical procedures used for the release or stability of rHuPH20 was 
performed in accordance with the principles outlined in ICH Q2 (R1).  
Stability  
The description of the container closure system for hyaluronidase is considered appropriate.  
The stability testing is conducted in line with the recommendations of the ICH Guideline Q5C. These 
data support the shelf-life at the recommended storage for the rHuPH20 at -80 °C up to 30 months.  
Adventitious agents  
The parental CHO cell line and the cell banks (MCB, WCB, and EOP) were all generated using 
synthetic media and there are no materials of animal origin used in the process. In addition, the 
media used to propagate the cell banks did not contain bovine serum albumin or trypsin. It is noted 
that the Insulin used is produced on yeast. In its manufacture, bovine materials are used. The 
supplier provided a declaration that they comply with the TSE requirements in the EU.

Five process steps were identified as virus clearance steps and were scaled-down and evaluated. 
Results of virus removal studies demonstrated that the additive effect of different steps give good 
assurance of virus clearance ability.  
On the viral distribution, and carryover studies the applicant presented data which demonstrated 
that for both new and aged resins, that virus distribution and carry over seem consistent. The viral 
clearance study was used to assess the viral inactivation/removal for selected chromatography 
steps at highest protein load capacities (worst case). The virus log reduction values (LRVs) were 
comparable between the maximum compared to the typical load conditions, except the Xenotropic 
Murine Leukemia Virus (X-MuLV) removal by a column. The MAH states that the inequality of the 
mass balance data is partially due to inactivation during washes; however, this has not been 
demonstrated directly. The CHMP recommended conducting additional viral inactivation studies to 
determine the mechanism of action of X-MuLV inactivation during the respective chromatography 
used in the manufacture of rHuPH20 to fully validate the inactivation process. 
Post-approval change management protocol: Additional manufacturing site for the 
novel excipient rHuPH20 
The initially submitted manufacturer of rHuPH20 does not have the manufacturing capacity to 
deliver the forecasted amount of rHuPH20 material for the products currently under licensing 
review on a mid- and long-term basis. In planning for this potential, an additional manufacturer has 
been developed to provide supply of rHuPH20. rHuPH20 enzyme sourced from both manufacturers 
has been used in the MabThera SC clinical trials.  
The applicant submitted a post-approval change management protol for the addition of the second 
manufacturer of rHuPH20. This was agreed at the Scientific Advice meeting with DKMA on March 28, 
2012. 
The applicant has detailed as to how it is assured that the facilities, manufacturing process and 
operations of second manufacturer are in line with the principles of EU GMP. 
The Post-Approval change management protocol contains a description of process change and 
process controls, description of analytical changes, risk assessment, studies already performed 
(including comparability assessment), studies to be performed, and submission of upcoming data. 
Almost all data needed for licensing of the second supplier are provided with this application, the 
exception being the production of a series of additional consecutive batches to further demonstrate 
consistency. The full information for these  additional consecutive batches will be provided after the 
data are available. No additional analytical characterisation or stability studies will be performed for 
the these additional batches from the second manufacturer. 
The comparability between the rHuPH20 produced at both manufacturing sites was assessed on full 
scale development and clinical batches as well as on PQ batches. The design of the comparability 
studies is considered adequate. 
In conclusion, the analytical comparability exercise adequately demonstrates that the quality 
attributes of rHuPH20 from both manufacturers are highly similar and sufficiently ensure equivalent 
safety and function of the excipient.

Considering the quality of the data presented and assessed in this report, the approach of the 
company is considered reasonable. By request specific activity acceptance criteria for the different 
chromatography steps in the change management protocol were introduced.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Quality Development 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the new pharmaceutical form (solution for 
injection); has been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The manufacturing process is overall, well described. The in-process control (IPC) tests are 
described and deemed suitable for controlling and monitoring the manufacturing process. 
Appropriate general information about the novel excipient rHuPH20 has been provided. The potency 
assay is adapted from the USP method for activity. The differences between the in-house method 
and the USP assay are stated and are acceptable.  
Based on the submitted information the HCP assay cannot be regarded as fully validated. However, 
any potential risk from the rHuPH20 is conceivably small due to the small quantities of rHuPH20 in 
the final Finished Product. Nevertheless, the MAH is recommended to quantitatively validate that 
the current HCP assay reliably measures CHO proteins present in the rHuPH20. Should this 
validation reveal that the generic ELISA is not capable of this, a process specific ELISA should be 
developed. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The changes to the rituximab SC process are clearly outlined. Only change in the rituximab SC 
process, compared to the currently approved rituximab IV process is the higher concentration of 
drug substance in the UFDF step.  
The change (higher concentration) of the UFDF step has not lead to any changes in the control 
system, which is considered acceptable. 
Comparability of rituximab SC vs currently approved rituximab IV drug substance is addressed 
Based on the submitted data, the application for Mabthera SC is recommended for approval based 
on quality grounds.  
Overall, information on manufacture and control of the active substance, finished product and novel 
excipient (rHuPH20) has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out 
indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important quality characteristics.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
rHuPH20, first manufacturer 
1.  It is recommended that the MAH should quantitatively validate that the current HCP assay 
is capable of detecting the majority of HCP present in the rHuPH20. Should this validation 
reveal  that  the  generic  ELISA  is  not  capable  of  this,  a  process  specific  ELISA  should  be 
developed.  
Additional manufacture of rHuPH20; second manufacturer 
2.  It  is  recommended  that  the  MAH  will  review  the  unclarified  harvest  enzyme  activity 
acceptance criteria of the process after collecting additional data from more commercial 
batches and reassess the acceptance criteria based on a larger data set.  
rHuPH20, both manufacturers 
3.  It  is  recommended  that  the  MAH  re-evaluate  the  specific  activity  limits  of  the  different 
chromatographic  steps  of  the  rHuPH20  manufacturing  process  at  both  sites  after 
manufacture of more commercial batches.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The non-clinical development program for rHuPH20 has previously been submitted by the MAH as 
part of the application for a SC formulation of trastuzumab (Herceptin® 
EMEA/H/C/000278/X/0060), and is submitted and assessed also via this procedure.  
In addition to studies performed with rHuPH20 alone, the following studies have been performed in 
support of the SC extension application for rituxmab:  
•  Comparative anti-tumour efficacy of IV and SC rituximab formulations (Report no 
1049779) 
•  SC pharmacokinetics of rituximab/rHuPH20 formulation in mice (Report no 1049704), 
minipigs (1029903) and Cynomolgus monkey (1036353) 
•  8-week repeat-dose SC toxicity in Cynomolgus monkeys (Report no 1029890) 
• 
Local tolerance in rabbits following SC administration of a rituximab/rHuPH20 formulation 
(Report no 1031874)

Besides rHuPH20, the excipients in the SC rituximab solution are well-known and included in the Ph. 
Eur. 
The preclinical safety studies for rituximab SC were conducted in accordance with the respective 
ICH guidances and in accordance with GLP. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Anti-tumor efficacy of IV and SC rituximab formulations in the human Z138 NHL (MCL) xenograft 
SCID mouse model (1049779) 
The pharmacodynamic effects of the SC rituximab formulation (containing rHuPH20) was compared 
to those of rituximab administered IV in a xenograft model implanting  Z138 Mantel cell lymphoma 
cells into female SCID beige mice (n=10/group). Animals were treated with SC and IV doses giving 
rise to similar rituximab trough levels (5, 16 and 50 mg/kg SC corresponding to 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg 
IV, respectively) on day 22, 29 and 36 after tumour cell inoculation. The applied SC rituximab 
formulation contained 4600 U/mL rHuPH20 in 0.9% saline and the injection was performed SC. The 
treatment effects on tumour growth are shown in the figure below. 
No statistically significant differences in anti-tumour efficacy were observed for corresponding IV 
and SC rituximab dosages. Serum analysis showed that rituximab levels of corresponding IV and 
SC doses were in the same range showing maximum 2 fold deviation. Still, the rituximab serum 
trough concentrations were generally slightly higher following SC administration. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted in support of this application.(see 
discussion on preclinical pharmacology).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Newly submitted studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics of rituximab following IV and/or SC 
administration in SCID beige mice, Göttingen minipigs and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Both SCID mice and Cynomolgus monkeys have been used in support of the original MAA for the IV 
formulation of rituximab via inclusion in pharmacodynamic and toxicity studies, respectively. 
Rituximab shows affinity for Cynomolgus monkey CD20 and depletion of Cynomolgus monkey B 
cells has been demonstrated following both IV and SC administration of 10 mg/kg rituximab. 
An overview of the conducted studies is given in Table 2 below.

** The variability of t ½ was large, where one animal showed t ½ of 329 h whereas the remaining two animals 
were in the range of 53.0-64.6 h 
The pharmacokinetic study in mice showed a relatively high bioavailability of 62.9%. Bioavailability 
was not evaluated in the Cynomolgus monkey study since no IV arm was included in the study 
design. However, based on the rituximab serum trough levels obtained in the IV and SC 
Cynomolgus monkey 8-week toxicity studies, the rituximab bioavailability following SC 
administration of 20 mg/kg rituximab appeared comparable to if not higher than following IV 
administration (also 20 mg/kg) (see also Toxicology). 
An overview of the pharmacokinetic study conducted in Göttingen minipigs can be found in tables 5 
and 6 below. A 120 mg/mL rituximab formulation was administered SC to each animal. In Groups 
2 to 4 the dose volume was 1 mL per animal, however, in Group 5 the animals received 2 mL SC. SC 
rituximab formulations with two different concentrations of rHuPH20 (2650 and 7170 IU/mL 
according to the certificates of analysis) was tested. The dose regimen resulted in average doses of 
10 mg/kg rituximab IV in Group 1 (no rHuPH20 included), and approximately 14 mg/kg rituximab 
in the SC dosed groups receiving 1 mL/animal (groups 2-4), and 28 mg/kg in the group receiving 2 
ml/animal (group 5).  
As can be derived from table 5, the Cmax was increased following administration of 1 mL rituximab 
formulation containing rHuPH20 (group 3) when compared to the formulation containing no 
rHuPH20 (group 2), and T max occurred earlier (24 hours compared to 48 hours without rHuPH20), 
indicating that rHuPH20 indeed did facilitate faster absorption of rituximab. While increasing the 
excipient concentration from 2650 to 7160 IU/mL did not further increase the systemic rituximab 
absorption, an doubling of Cmax and AUC was observed when the injection volume of the rHuPH20 
containing rituximab formulation was increased from 1 to 2 mL.

As shown in table 6, Group 2, receiving 14 mg/kg rituximab with 2000 IU/mL rHuPH20 dosed at 1 
ml per animal, showed the highest bioavailability (F=70.7± 28.1 %). Doubling of the dose volume, 
or increasing the rHuPH20 content to 6000 U/mL resulted in bioavailability similar to the rituximab 
formulation without any rHuPH20 (57-58% and 52.4 % respectively).

Single dose toxicity 
Single -dose toxicity studies have not been submitted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
An 8-week repeat-dose toxicity study was performed with the new SC formulation including the 
rHuPH20 excipient (2000 IU/mL) to bridge to the previously performed IV studies with rituximab. A 
dose of 20 mg/kg/week rituximab SC was evaluated and the treatment period was followed by a 13 
week recovery period. The following parameters were evaluated during the study; clinical signs 
(including qualitative food consumption), body weights, ophthalmic findings, ECG findings, blood 
pressure measurements, immunophenotyping, haematology, clinical chemistry, urine analysis, 
organ weights, macroscopic necropsy findings, histopathological examinations, anti-drug antibody 
determination, anti-rHuPH20 antibody analysis and toxicokinetics evaluation. No toxicities were 
observed, and the SC formulation was well tolerated. At terminal kill, one female in the control 
group showed acute inflammation at the injection site, whereas 5 animals in the treated group 
showed slight sub-acute inflammation at the injection site. The study pathologist found these 
lesions to be within the expected findings of a SC injection study, and did not attribute the findings 
to be related to the test item. One male in the 20 mg/kg/week group showed markedly elevated 
GLDH and moderately increased ALT values on Day 52, which correlated to a slightly increased liver 
weight at necropsy as well as marked hepatocellular necrosis. No infectious agent was observed 
histologically, but antibodies against hepatitis A were detected in serum from this animal. Therefore 
it was stated that a relationship to treatment is rather unlikely for this finding.

As in the previously submitted 8-week IV study, no toxicologically significant findings apart from the 
B-cell depletion were observed following SC administration of rituximab containing rHuPH20.  
The Applicant provided a table presenting the serum trough levels from the IV study performed in 
support of the original MAA, and the values obtained following SC administrations in the present 
study (see Table 8). The values are similar especially following the first dosing cycle, at which point 
in time no anti-rituximab antibodies have been formed. From Day 36 and 99 following SC 
administration of rituximab (males and females respectively) low or no exposure levels of rituximab 
were observed. This was attributed to an accelerated clearance due to an immune response against 
rituximab in several monkeys. As AUC values had not been determined in the IV study, no AUC 
comparison was possible.

Toxicokinetic data 
Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of rituximab SC (containing rHuPH20) was evaluated in a dedicated study in 
rabbits (Report number 1031874), as well as in the 8 week SC toxicity study performed in 
Cynomolgus monkeys (Report number 1029890).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 25/103 
 
 
  
  
 
In the rabbit local tolerance study, 6 rabbits were either dosed SC with 60 mg rituximab SC 
formulation (including 2000 IU/mL rHuPH20) per site or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) at a volume of 0.5 
mL/site. Three rabbits were killed 24 hours after dosing, and the last 3 rabbits were killed 96 hours 
after dosing. A histopathological evaluation was performed of the injection sites as well as both 
axillary and inguinal lymph nodes representing draining and non-draining lymph nodes. No changes 
attributable to the treatment with the rituximab SC formulation were observed. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys (20 mg/kg/week, 0.167 mL/kg), the SC 
injection sites were evaluated histopathologically at terminal kill. One female in the control group 
(vehicle including rHuPH20) showed acute inflammation at the injection site, whereas 5 animals in 
the treated group showed slight sub-acute inflammation at the injection site. The study pathologist 
found these lesions to be within the expected findings of a SC injection study, and did not attribute 
the findings to be related to the test item, and therefore the rituximab SC formulation appeared to 
be well tolerated in the repeat-dose treatment in the cynomolgus monkey. 
Other toxicity studies 
Recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) 
The excipient rHuPH20 is a transiently active, locally-acting permeation enhancing enzyme that 
allows for the SC delivery of therapeutics that has been delivered IV. The mode of action of the 
rHuPH20 is to locally depolymerize the substrate, hyaluronan (or hyaluronic acid), at the site of 
injection in the skin. Hyaluronan is a repeating polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine and glucuronic acid 
that contributes to the soluble gel-like component of the extracellular matrix of the skin. 
Depolymerisation of hyaluronan by hyaluronidase is accomplished by hydrolysis of the repeating 
polysaccharide polymer. This depolymerisation of hyaluronan results in decreased viscosity of the 
SC matrix and, thus, to an improved delivery of SC administered drugs into the systemic circulation. 
The decreased viscosity of the SC matrix allows administration of larger volumes of fluid, e.g., dose 
volume of 11.7 mL for the clinical dose of the rituximab SC formulation. 
The non-clinical development program for rHuPH20 have been submitted previously by the 
Applicant in the extension application for a SC formulation of Herceptin 
(EMEA/H/C/000278/X/0060), and the pharmacology and toxicology studies have been assessed in 
this procedure.  
In addition to the studies performed with rHuPH20 alone, the Applicant has also submitted 7 studies 
in the present application that have been performed with trastuzumab/rHuPH20. These studies are 
not assessed in the current procedure, as they have been assessed in the previously submitted 
extension application the SC formulation of Herceptin.  
An overview of the non-clinical studies conducted with rHuPH20 alone and in combination with 
trastuzumab is given in Table 11 and 12 below.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment studies have been submitted (see Discussion on non-clinical 
aspects.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
As could be expected, a comparative study in a tumour xenograft mouse model showed that there 
was no significant difference in anti-tumour efficacy of IV and SC administered rituximab when 
doses giving rise to similar serum trough levels were administered. The pharmacodynamic action of 
rituximab is adequately characterised and further studies on safety pharmacology are not required. 
In general the methods of PK analysis for rituximab and anti-rituximab antibodies are considered to 
be adequate.  
Newly submitted studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics of rituximab following IV and/or SC 
administration in SCID beige mice, Göttingen minipigs and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Bioavailability following SC administration of 30 mg/kg rituximab with 6000 IU/mL rHuPH20 to 
SCID mice was 62.9% while the Tmax and half-life was 2 and 202 hours, respectively.  
In Cynomolgus monkeys, Tmax and half-life occurred at 24 hours and from 53 to 329 hours 
post-dosing following administration of a SC rituximab (20 mg/kg) formulation containing 6000 
IU/mL rHuPH20 (n=3). Bioavailability was not evaluated as part of the study. However, based on 
the rituximab serum trough levels obtained in the IV and SC Cynomolgus monkey 8-week toxicity 
studies, the rituximab bioavailability following SC administration of appeared comparable to if not 
higher than following IV administration of 20 mg/kg rituximab. 
The pharmacokinetics of SC rituximab formulations containing 2650 and 7170 IU/mL of the 
excipient rHuPH20 was evaluated in minipigs. The minipig was chosen for SC formulation testing, as 
the structure of the subcutis in this species resembles the human more than the other more 
traditionally used laboratory species like rat, rabbit, dog or monkey (Rose et al 1977). 
Addition of rHuPH20 to the SC formulation increased the rituximab Cmax and Tmax occurred earlier 
(24 hours compared to 48 hours without rHuPH20), indicating that rHuPH20 indeed did facilitate 
faster absorption of rituximab. The rituximab formulation containing 2650 IU/mL rHuPH20 was 
associated with the highest bioavailability (F=71% while increasing the rHuPH20 content to 7170 
IU/mL or doubling the dose volume from 1 to 2 mL resulted in overall bioavailability (57-58%) 
comparable to the formulation with no rHuPH20 added (54%). However, the validity of this finding 
was questioned since the clearance and consequently half-life of rituximab was significantly 
different in the group receiving rituximab in combination with 2650 IU/mL rHuPH20 when compared 
to the other SC study groups. Moreover, the large inter-individual variation in rituximab 
bioavailability is noticeable hence the bioavailability ranged from 52 to 98% and from 28 to 93% in 
minipigs administered rituximab formulations containing 2650 and 7170 IU/mL rHuPH20, 
respectively (See discussion on clinical aspects). The SC dose volume was limited to 1 to 2 mL per 
minipig, whereas in the clinical setting a dose volume of 11.7 mL per SC administration of rituximab 
is to be applied.

No distribution studies have been submitted. The SC delivery of IgG is generally considered to be 
absorbed via the lymphatic system, before reaching the systemic circulation (Lobo et al, 2004). 
Once in systemic circulation the IgG undergoes similar distribution relative to that observed 
following IV administration, and hence rituximab SC is expected to show similar tissue distribution 
behaviour as rituximab after IV administration. Therefore the lack of any new distribution studies is 
acceptable. 
The lack of any dedicated studies of excretion of rituximab SC is acceptable, as the monoclonal 
antibody is expected to undergo proteolysis and the resulting amino acids are excreted or recycled.  
IgG catabolism is described in the literature; IgGs are to be cleared from the body predominantly 
via catabolism and that the binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) has a key role in maintaining 
IgG homeostasis by protecting the IgG from catabolism (Lobo et al 2004). As uptake of IgGs from 
the interstitial space into the lymphatic system and subsequent back transport into blood circulation 
also occurs following IV administration as part of the normal distribution and re-circulation process 
of IgGs (Lobo et al, 2004), metabolic processes unique to SC administration of an IgG are 
considered to be unlikely. 
Overall the catabolism processes of rituximab administered SC are expected to be similar to those 
after IV administration. No dedicated studies on the excretion of rituximab SC have been submitted. 
IgG antibodies undergo minimal renal or biliary excretion (Lobo et al, 2004) however they are 
expected to undergo catabolism by proteolysis in the lysosymes. The resulting amino acids and 
small peptides may subsequently be excreted or added to the endogenous amino acid pool. 
The lack of any dedicated PK drug interaction studies is acceptable, as the potential for PK drug 
interaction is expected to be similar to that of the IV formulation of rituximab, and the use of 
rituximab administered IV is well established. 
The only finding in the 8-week repeat-dose toxicity study of rituximab SC was the expected 
pharmacodynamic effect, namely B-cell depletion. Hence no new additional toxicities were 
observed following SC injection of rituximab formulation containing approximately 2000 IU/mL 
rHuPH20, when compared to the IV administration of rituximab. The dose of 20 mg/kg rituximab IV 
(performed in support of the original MAA) and SC resulted in comparable trough levels after first 
dose illustrating the relatively high bioavailability of the SC formulation. 
Based on allometric scaling, the obtained margin of safety following 8-week repeat dose treatment 
of Cynomolgus monkey is only 0.3, however based on obtained AUC0-168h (mean of both sexes) the 
margin of safety is slightly higher (1.1-fold). Still, the dose level of 20 mg/kg in the animal study is 
similar to the IV doses applied in the repeat dose study in cynomolgus monkeys submitted for the 
original MAA, complete and prolonged B-cell depletion was achieved in monkeys demonstrating 
expected activity in these animals, and the clinical use of rituximab is well established, hence the 
lack of any significant safety margin is not considered of concern. 
Formal scientific advice has been provided by the CHMP on the adequacy of the non-clinical 
program for rHuPH20 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/806036/2009). The proposed abbreviated program (no 
studies on metabolism, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity) was considered acceptable provided that 
no untoward findings emerged in the studies. The lack of any genotoxicity evaluation and 
carcinogenicity studies for rituximab SC is acceptable and in line with the relevant guidance ICH S6 
(R1). This information has been reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 29/103 
 
  
  
 
The lack of reproductive and developmental studies with the rituximab SC formulation is considered 
to be justified. It is not expected that rituximab given SC will give rise to any additional reproductive 
findings not already observed following IV administration, and the excipient rHuPH20 has been 
studied separately in an embryo-fetal development study as well as a peri- and post-natal 
development study in mice. Reproductive organs were examined as part of the 8-week repeat-dose 
SC toxicity study with rituximab SC in Cynomolgus monkey and no adverse findings were noted. In 
the repeated dose toxicity study (39-week SC) in cynomolgus monkeys studying rHuPH20, no 
abnormalities were seen in reproductive organs, semen parameters, testosterone or LH levels and 
menstrual cycling. Due to the low overall doses of rHuPH20 (≤ 0.21 mg/m2) to be used in patients 
receiving rituximab SC and the general lack of measurable rHuPH20 systemic exposure in man, the 
risk for effects on embryonic/fetal development subsequent to rituximab SC dosing is considered to 
be low.  
Therefore it is agreed that additional reproductive toxicity studies will not add significantly to the 
current knowledge. Relevant information has been included in the SmPC section 5.3 and in section 
4.6 it is stated that “Due to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women 
of childbearing potential must employ effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months 
after treatment with MabThera”.  
The rituximab SC formulation including rHuPH20 was well tolerated in the rabbit local tolerance 
study as well as in the 8 week SC repeat-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkey. A slight 
inflammatory response was observed in the repeat-dose toxicity study, however, the findings were 
within the range to be expected following SC administration and changes were also seen in the 
control group. 
The non-clinical studies conducted with the excipient rHuPH20 have been assessed previously via 
the line extension application for Herceptin (EMEA/H/C/000278/X/0060). Administration of 
rHuPH20 was neither associated with adverse findings in a 39-week SC repeat-dose toxicity study 
in Cynomolgus monkeys nor in a mice SC pre- and post-natal development study. Increased 
resorptions, decreased litter size and decreased fetal weight were observed in a SC embryo-fetal 
development study conducted in mice with a NOAEL of 3 mg/kg/day (9 mg/m2/day).  
No environmental risk assessment studies have been submitted; this is in line with the relevant 
guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The preclinical programme on the subcutaneous formulation of Mabthera is considered satisfactory. 
Resulting information has been adequately reflected in the SmPC.

indications are available from two randomized studies:

A two-stage, randomized, open-label, multicenter adaptive Phase Ib study to investigate the PK, 
safety, and tolerability of R-SC formulation in patients with FL as part of maintenance treatment. 
The primary objective of Stage 1 (dose selection) was to determine a R-SC dose that yielded 
comparable serum trough concentrations (Ctrough) to rituximab IV (R-IV) in the FL maintenance 
population. The primary objective of Stage 2 (dose confirmation) was to demonstrate comparable 
Ctrough of R-IV and R-SC (using the SC dose determined in Stage 1), as assessed by a 
non-inferiority test with a lower boundary above 0.8 for the two-sided 90% confidence interval. The 
FL maintenance patient population was chosen to determine the R-SC dose and to statistically 
demonstrate Ctrough comparability because the PK variability among this patient population was 
expected to be lower in these patients compared with those in the induction setting (as a result of 
the lower tumor load in responders who are eligible for maintenance). In the dose-selection part, 
exposure to R-SC was limited to one single administration during the maintenance period to prevent 
potential underexposure of patients who were currently being maintained in remission on R-IV, and 
a modeling approach was used to derive information on the R-SC PK characteristics. Once the final 
Assessment report

SC dose had been selected in Stage 1, patients randomized to an SC cohort and who had received 
rituximab IV maintenance treatment for at least 4 cycles for the q3m regimen or 6 cycles for the 
q2m regimen (i.e., at least 1 year IV maintenance) were given the option to switch to the final 
selected SC dose for their remaining cycles of maintenance treatment (SC extension phase). 
Study BO22334 (SABRINA):  
A two-stage, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter Phase III study to investigate the PK, 
efficacy, and safety of R-SC in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, 
prednisolone (CHOP) or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone (CVP) versus R-IV in 
combination with CHOP or CVP (induction treatment) in patients with previously untreated FL 
followed by maintenance treatment with either R-SC or R-IV. The primary objective of Stage 1 was 
to estimate the ratio of Ctrough(SC)/Ctrough(IV) at Cycle 7 of induction treatment, 21 days after 
administration. The primary analysis for Stage 1 was scheduled when PK data were available from 
approximately 100 patients who had completed Cycle 7 (induction). At the cut-off date of March 14, 
2012, PK data were available from 113 patients (of 127 patients enrolled). Results of the PK 
analysis were reported together with safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy results from Stage 1. 
The study is ongoing: patients in Stage 1 are continuing in the maintenance phase, and enrollment 
to Stage 2 has been initiated (280 patients planned). Stage 2 aims to provide additional efficacy and 
safety data of R-SC compared with R-IV, using the R-SC dose established in Stage 1. Dense 
sampling for PK/PD assessments was carried out during the first cycle in study BP22333. Thereafter 
sampling was performed pre-dose in the following cycles and during follow-up every 3 months until 
9 months after the last dose of maintenance treatment. Assessment of rHuPH20 was also 
performed in this study from samples taken 4 times on day 1 and 2.

2.4.1.  Methods 
Analytical methods  
Measurement of rituximab concentration and rHuPH20 activity 
Rituximab assay 
A validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure rituximab 
concentrations in serum. The reporting range established during the partial validation performed at 
Covance was 5.0 – 128 ng/ml and 5.0 – 150 ng/ml at QPS.  
rHuPH20 assay 
A validated microplate-based colorimetric assay was used to measure rHuPH20 activity in plasma 
by biotin/ streptavidin methodology.  
Detection of Anti-Rituximab and Anti-rHuPH20 Antibodies 
Anti-Rituximab Antibody Assays 
A validated bridging ELISA was used to detect and confirm the presence of anti-rituximab 
antibodies in serum. The assay uses a two-tiered approach: 1) a screening assay, which detects 
anti-rituximab antibodies (screen-positives), and 2) a confirmatory assay, which contains an 
immunodepletion (competitive binding) step to assess the specificity of initial positive results 
(confirmed positives).Positivity for anti-rituximab antibodies was assessed by photometric 
absorbance. The neutralization potential of anti-rituximab antibodies was measured by B-cell 
depletion, as a direct measurement of drug activity based on its mode of action; this was a more 
appropriate marker for loss of in vivo activity rather than an in vitro neutralizing antibody assay. 
Anti-rHuPH20 Antibody Assay 
A validated bridging electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) was used to detect and 
confirm the presence of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in plasma.  
Neutralizing Anti-rHuPH20 Antibody Assay 
A validated United States Pharmacopeia (USP) turbidimetric method was used to detect neutralizing 
anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in plasma.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The Phase Ib Study BP22333 included patients who had responded to induction and had received 1 
to 11 cycles of rituximab IV as part of a q2m or q3m maintenance dosing regimen, and PK data were 
modeled using NONMEM to allow a comparison to be made between rituximab SC and rituximab IV 
at Cycle 2 maintenance. In the Phase III Study BO22334, observed data were used to determine PK 
parameters at Cycle 7 of induction in combination with CHOP or CVP chemotherapy. The observed 
PK data were derived using Phoenix Winnonlin. As a result of these differences, the PK results 
across studies cannot be directly compared. 
In both studies (BP22333 and BO22334), rituximab PK parameters (Ctrough, AUCτ, Cmax) were 
derived from actual rituximab serum concentrations according to standard non-compartmental

analysis (NCA) methods using Winnonlin Version 6.2 (Pharsight, Mountain View, California, United 
States). AUCτ parameters were derived using the linear trapezoidal method and actual sampling 
times for all patients. At least three concentration timepoints were used for the calculation of a 
terminal rate constant. All NCA PK parameters were summarized using descriptive statistics, 
including arithmetic means, standard deviations, geometric means, coefficients of variation (CV), 
medians, and ranges. Less than 0.5% of post-dose observations had values below the 
quantification limit (BQL) . These values were excluded from the analysis as it was not deemed 
necessary to apply likelihood-based method for handling of the BQL data. 
Peripheral blood CD19+ lymphocyte counts (B cells) were summarized for the safety analysis 
population (SAP) using descriptive statistics (SI units: × 109 cells/L), including mean, standard 
deviation, median, and range (minimum and maximum values). The normal range was defined as 
0.08 − 0.616 × 109 cells/L. 
Statistical analysis 
A non-inferiority test was applied to demonstrate comparability of the predicted rituximab Ctrough 
and AUCτ levels for both routes of administration (the lower limit of the 90% double sided 
confidence interval of the ratio Ctrough SC / Ctrough IV or AUCτ SC / AUCτ IV is above 0.8) at cycle 
7 of induction, cycle 10 (cycle 2 of maintenance treatment) and cycle 18 (the last cycle of the 
maintenance treatment).

Dose selection – study BP22333 
In  study  BP22333,  pharmacokinetics  of  rituximab  was  compared  in  FL  patients  following 
administration  of  350  mg/m2  IV,  350  mg/m2  SC,  625  mg/m2  SC  and  800  mg/m2  SC  in  the 
maintenance  phase  in  order  to  derive  a  SC  dose  that  would  lead  to  a  comparable  mean  Ctrough 
between  rituximab  IV  and  rituximab  SC  administration.  Following  SC  administration,  rituximab 
concentrations increased slowly and reached the peak at around 3.0 days post-dose. During this 
phase,  SC  concentrations  were  maintained  below  the  IV  ones  and  then  reached  the  same 
magnitude of exposure at the time of maximal concentrations

The AUCτ was clearly lower with rituximab SC 375 mg/ m2 as compared to IV. The data suggested 
a dose of between 625 and 800 mg/ m2 rituximab SC would be required to achieve non-inferiority 
to rituximab IV with a high variability of Ctrough > 50%. See table 3 for a comparison of mean

Fixed dose selection 
The applicant considered the therapeutic range of rituximab wide enough to select a fixed dose over 
dosing based on BSA. A modeling approach was used to determine a fixed dose that would result in 
non-inferior Ctrough. The structural model combined a two-compartment model with time-varying 
clearance (see methods pharmacokinetic analysis). Serum Ctrough and AUCτ values were simulated 
100 times by comparing rituximab IV 375 mg/m2 with various fixed doses of rituximab SC between 
1100 and 1400 mg and assuming a BSA distribution of 1.92 m2 ± 0.24 m2. The dose selection was 
performed on Ctrough concentrations at Cycle 7 of the induction period and at Cycle 2 of the 
maintenance period. A non-inferiority test was applied to each of the 100 replicates, and the 
percentage of replicates with a positive non-inferiority test corresponded to the probability of 
success of the trial. The probability of success, the expected geometric mean CtroughSC/CtroughIV 
ratio, the lower and higher bounds of the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio with 
their [P5-P95] confidence interval comparing the 375 mg/m2 IV dose and the 1400 mg dose in the 
induction and maintenance settings are summarized in table 3. 
Simulation showed that a rituximab SC dose of 1400 mg tested in 75 patients would result in ≥ 80% 
probability of success in both the induction (92%) and maintenance settings (92% and 84% in q2m 
and q3m, respectively). At this dose for maintenance treatment, the mean expected Ctrough ratio, 
the  lower  bound,  and  the  higher  bound  were  1.33,  1.01,  and  1.76,  respectively,  for  the  q2m 
regimen; and 1.36, 1.00, and 1.86, respectively, for the q3m regimen. At this dose for induction 
treatment, the mean expected Ctrough ratio, the lower bound, and the higher bound were 1.34, 1.03, 
and 1.47, respectively, for the q3w regimen. With the fixed dose of 1400 mg rituximab SC, the 
probability  of  success  of  a  non-inferiority  test  on  AUCτ  during  the  induction  and  maintenance 
periods was higher than 95%. At this dose for maintenance treatment, the mean expected AUCτ 
ratio, the lower bound, and the higher bound were 1.28, 1.09, and 1.49, respectively, for the q2m 
regimen; and 1.28, 1.11, and 1.49, respectively, for the q3m regimen. At this dose for induction 
treatment, the mean expected AUCτ ratio, the lower bound, and the higher bound were 1.26, 1.05, 
and 1.52, respectively, for the q3w regimen.

Table 3. Dose selection: Probability of Success and Ctrough Ratios during the Maintenance Period 
Cycle 2. 
Since the IV dose is given by BSA and that the SC dose is a fixed dose, the simulation results were 
compared between extreme BSA categories to ensure that the non-inferiority of the SC versus the 
IV was present across the entire body-weight range. The low BSA category corresponded to BSA 
below percentile 5th (<1.51) and the high BSA category corresponded to BSA above percentile 95th 
(≥  2.33).  The  results  of  the  Ctrough  geometric  mean  ration  (CtroughSC/CtroughIV)  for  the  two  BSA 
categories  in  the  induction  and  maintenance  setting  are  presented  in  Table  4.  Non-inferior 
concentrations are expected in SC arm compared to IV over the whole range of BSA. However, in 
patients  with  low  BSA,  mean  Ctrough  Rituximab  levels  were    68-102%  higher  following  SC 
administration compared to IV dosing.

Dose Confirmation: study BP22333 Stage 2 - maintenance 
The  objective  of  Stage  2  was  to  confirm  the  rituximab  SC  dose  identified  in  Stage  1  by 
demonstration  of  comparability  of  the  predicted  Ctrough  of  rituximab  SC  and  rituximab  IV,  as 
assessed  by  a  non-inferiority  test  with  a  lower  boundary  above  0.8  for  the  two-sided  90% 
confidence interval. The PK evaluable population was N = 76 from the rituximab IV group (Cohort 
E) and N = 77 from the rituximab SC group (Cohort F).  
The predicted geometric mean Ctrough values at Cycle 2 (maintenance) were higher in the rituximab 
SC arm than the rituximab IV arm (Table 5). For the q2m and the q3m regimens, the geometric 
mean ratio CtroughSC/CtroughIV values were 1.24 and 1.12, respectively, with corresponding lower 
limit  of  the  two-sided  90%  confidence  interval  of  1.02  and  0.86,  respectively.  Both  of  these

lower-limit  values  are  greater  than  the  pre-specified  non-inferiority  margin  of  0.8.  Therefore, 
non-inferiority for the primary endpoint was met. The AUCtau ratio (AUCtauSC /AUCtauIV) indicates 
that rituximab exposure increases by 35% after SC administration compared to IV in average.

The mean Cmax for rituximab SC and  for rituximab IV  were comparable following q2m and q3m 
regimen. The median t max in the rituximab SC arm was approximately 3 days as compared to the 
t max occurring at or close to the end of the infusion for the rituximab IV arm. 
Dose Confirmation: study BO22334 Stage 2 - induction 
The  primary  endpoint  in  Stage  1  was  the  estimated  ratio  of  observed  rituximab  serum 
CtroughSC/CtroughIV  at  Cycle  7  of  induction  treatment.  The  primary  analysis  was  performed  on 
observed rituximab serum Ctrough values from Cycle 7, measured 3 weeks after the Cycle 7 dose 
(pre-dose Cycle 8).  
The mean and geometric mean Ctrough values at pre-dose Cycle 8 were higher among the rituximab 
SC group than the rituximab IV group (Table 6). The geometric mean ratio C troughSC/CtroughIV value 
was 1.62 with a corresponding lower limit for the two-sided 90% confidence interval of 1.36. Hence, 
non-inferiority  for  the  primary  PK  endpoint  was  demonstrated  for  induction.  The  coefficients  of 
variation  (CV)  for  Ctrough  at  Cycle  7  were  43.2%  in  the  rituximab  SC  group  and  36.7%  in  the 
rituximab IV group, demonstrating comparable variability in the two groups. Rituximab exposure 
increases by 38% after SC administration compared to IV in average (Table 6).

Table 6. Dose confirmation induction phase study BO22334: summary of Ctrough and AUC at Cycle 7, Stage 1. 
Using  the  covariate  PopPK  model,  a  secondary  analysis  was  performed  using  the  predicted  PK 
parameters  for  analysis  of  Ctrough.  For  Ctrough,  the  geometric  mean  was  135.4  μg/mL  for  the 
rituximab  SC  group  compared  with  87.8  μg/mL  for  the  rituximab  IV  group.  The  resulting  GMR 
CtroughSC/CtroughIV)  value  was  1.54  with  a  corresponding  lower  limit  for  the  two-sided  90% 
confidence interval of 1.32, which is above the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.8. Further 
support that rituximab SC was not inferior to rituximab IV route was obtained by ORR analysis.   
For AUC, the predicted geometric mean was 3898 μg•day/mL for the rituximab SC group compared 
with 2726 μg•day/mL for the rituximab IV group. For Cmax, the predicted geometric mean was 
234.5 μg/mL for the rituximab SC group compared with 247.6 μg/mL for the rituximab IV group. 
The median terminal elimination half-life was 29.7 days.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Rituximab  PK  was  described  in  the  final  population  PK  model,  including  all  data  from  studies 
BP22333  and  BO22334,  by  a  two-compartment  model.  Clearance  was  presented  as  a  sum  of  a 
non-specific  time-independent  clearance  (CLinf)  and  time  dependent  target-mediated  clearance 
(CLt) that exponentially decreased with time, due to depletion of peripheral CD19+ lymphocytes 
(B-cells). 
The  estimates  of  time-independent  clearance  (194  mL/day),  inter-compartment  clearance  (773 
mL/day), central compartment volume (4370 mL), and peripheral compartment volume (3880 mL) 
were in the range typical for monoclonal antibodies. The estimate of absorption rate constant was 
0.340 L/day and bioavailability was 71.0%. High initial time-dependent clearance (535 mL/day in 
addition  to  time-  independent  clearance)  can  possibly  be  attributed  to  the  target-mediated 
elimination. This clearance component decreased with time, with a half-life of about 12 and 30 days 
for Study BO22334 and Study BP22333, respectively. The median terminal elimination half-life was 
29.7 days with a range of 9.9 to 91.2 days. 
All clearance and volume parameters increased with body size. These dependencies were described 
by  the  power  functions  of  body  surface  area  with  the  power  coefficients  of  1.31  and  1.38  for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 42/103 
 
 
  
  
 
clearance  and  volume  parameters,  respectively.  Among  other  covariate  dependencies,  central 
volume increased with age and absorption rate constant decreased with age (for age >60 years), 
but these dependencies were shown to result in negligible changes in rituximab exposure. The PK of 
rituximab did not depend on gender and baseline albumin concentrations. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected in only 13 (3%) patients, and they did not influence the 
steady-state clearance. The diagnostic plots suggested a possible effect on the time dependent part 
of  clearance  (CLT).  While  inclusion  of  this  effect  in  the  model  indicated  an  increase  of  CLT  in 
subjects with ADA, the model that accounted for this effect did not result in the decrease of the 
inter-subject variability. Also, the effect size was estimated with very large uncertainty, with the 
confidence  intervals  that  included  the  null  values.  Thus,  the  effect  was  not  included  in  the  final 
model. 
2.4.4.  Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal and hepatic function 
Data on renal and hepatic function were not submitted (see discussion on Cluinical Pharmacology).  
• 
Gender 
Among the 403 patients, there were 181 (45%) male patients and 222 (55%) female patients. 
Ctrough  and  AUC  rituximab  values  at  cycle  7    were  higher  in  females  than  in  males,  but  when 
corrected for BSA, gender was no covariate for rituximab pharmacokinetics (data not shown). 
• 
Race 
Most of the patients were White (87%), while the majority of non-White patients were of other race 
(11% of the total). In terms of ethnicity, only 31 patients (8%) were Hispanic. Thus, the dataset 
was not representative to allow the analysis of the race or ethnicity dependence of PK parameters. 
• 
Weight 
In moving from a BSA-adjusted dosing approach to a fixed-dose approach, it is important to ensure 
that patients with high BSA would be adequately exposed and those with low BSA would not be 
over-exposed to rituximab. The mean weight and BSA of the population were 74.4 kg (range: 43.9 
− 130 kg) and 1.83 m2 (range: 1.34 − 2.48 m2), respectively. 
BSA was identified as the main covariate affecting clearance and volume in the pop-PK model. All 
clearance and volume parameters increased with the body size. Stratification by body size shows 
gmean Ctrough ratio of 2.25, 1.65, and 1.21 in patients with a BSA of 1.4, 1.9, and 2.4 m2, 
respectively. The corresponding AUCτ ratios were 1.96, 1.45, and 1.09. When patients were 
grouped in three subpopulations, patients with the lowest 33rd percentile BSA had on average a 
66% higher exposure to rituximab following SC administration compared to IV route. Patients with 
BSA between 33-66percentile or >66th percentile had on average 17% and 32% higher rituximab 
exposure. Results from this analysis are summarized in Table 7.

• 
Elderly 
Among other covariate dependencies, central volume increased with age and the absorption rate 
constant decreased with age (for patients aged >60 years). However, these age dependencies were 
shown to result in negligible changes in rituximab exposure (data not shown).  
• 
Tumour load at baseline 
As would be expected, baseline tumour size and B-cell counts affected the initial (time-dependent) 
clearance, but inclusion of these effects did not result in the decrease of the inter-subject variability. 
Also,  the  parameters  for  these  effects  were  estimated  with  very  large  uncertainty,  with  the 
confidence intervals that included the null values. Thus, these effects were not included in the final 
model.

Anti-rituximab antibodies 
Effect of anti-rituximab antibodies on pharmacokinetics of rituximab was evaluated. During Stage 1 
of Study BP22333, there were no positive HACA samples at any time-point (among 124 patients 
tested). During Stage 2, only one of 154 patients tested (0.6%) had positive HACA results, both at 
baseline (prior to receiving any rituximab in the study) and at later time-points. Patient 2207 had 
positive HACA results during his first study cycle. HACA titers of 2.51 at baseline, and 2.81 at Day 
22, and Day 85  were recorded. The overall rate for  anti-rituximab antibody positivity, including 
baseline  and  post-baseline,  was  1%  (1/77)  for  the  rituximab  SC  group  and  0%  (0/77)  for  the 
rituximab IV group. 
In Study BO22334, blood samples for the analysis of anti-rituximab antibodies were collected from 
all patients immediately prior to the administration of rituximab at each cycle during induction (i.e., 
every 3 weeks for 8 cycles) and maintenance treatment (i.e., every 8 weeks for 2 years), and every 
12  weeks  after  the  last  rituximab  administration  until  96  weeks  after  the  last  rituximab 
administration (i.e., 8 follow-up visits). Of the 124 patients with samples available at baseline, 114 
patients  (57  patients  per  arm)  tested  negative  for  HACA  at  baseline.  Of  these  114  patients,  1 
patient in each arm had a transient positive result post-baseline (i.e., a positivity rate of 2% per 
arm when restricted to patients who were negative at baseline). 
• 
Anti-rHuPH20 antibodies 
In study B22333 stage 1, 7 of the 108 patients treated with rituximab SC had a positive result for 
anti-rHuPH20 antibodies; hence, the overall rate of anti-rHuPH20 positivity in Stage 1 was 6.5% 
(lb025_s001).  Six  (5.5%)  of  these  patients  tested  positive  at  baseline;  that  is,  prior  to  the 
subcutaneous administration of rituximab. Titers recorded at baseline in patients in Stage 2 ranged 
from 2 to 32. No neutralizing antibody activity was detected. 
The overall rate for anti-rHuPH20 antibody positivity (including baseline and post-baseline) in the 
study  was  13%  (8/62  patients)  for  the  SC  arm  and  14%  (9/65  patients)  for  the  IV  arm.  The 
majority of the patients testing positive showed a positive result already at baseline, that is, prior to 
the administration of any study drug. The rate of baseline positivity was 10% (6/59 patients) in the 
SC arm and 11% (7/64 patients) in the IV arm. Of the patients who were anti-rHuPH20 antibody 
negative at baseline (53 in the SC arm and 57 in the IV arm), antibodies were observed at later 
time-points in 2/53 patients (4%) in the SC group (Patients 2156 and 2881) and 2/57 patients (4%) 
in the IV group (Patients 1542 and 2756). All of the confirmed-positive samples in Study BO22334 
were negative for the presence of neutralizing antibodies.

2.4.5.  rHuPH20 Pharmacokinetics   
In study BP22333, plasma rHuPH20 concentrations were measured at predose and at 30 minutes, 
1 hour, and 24 hours postdose, in a total of 185 patients treated with rituximab SC: n = 34 in Cohort 
B, n = 34 in Cohort C, and n = 40 in Cohort D (Stage 1); and n = 77 in Cohort F (Stage 2). Plasma 
rHuPH20  concentrations  were  below  the  limit  of  quantification  (BLQ,  <  0.3125  U/mL)  for  all 
sampling timepoints in all but one of the 185 patients with available data, indicating that the use of 
rHuPH20  as  a  permeation  enhancer  for  rituximab  results  in  a  very  low  likelihood  of  observing 
quantifiable systemic exposure to the enzyme. 
Given  the  low  likelihood  of  systemic  rHuPH20  exposure  in  patients  and  the  short  half-life  of 
rHuPH20, it is unlikely rHuPH20 will accumulate in the plasma with the planned marketed regimen. 
2.4.6.  Pharmacodynamic results – B-cell count  
Peripheral  blood  CD19+  lymphocyte  counts  (B  cells)  were  summarized  for  the  safety  analysis 
population  (SAP)  using  descriptive  statistics  (SI  units:  ×  109  cells/L),  including  mean,  standard  
deviation, median, and range (minimum and maximum values). The normal range was defined as 
0.08 − 0.616 × 109 cells/L. 
B-cell count: Study BP22333 maintenance phase 
B-cell  depletion  was  defined  as  peripheral  blood  CD19+  lymphocyte  count  <  80  cells/mm3.  
Available data from 124 patients in Stage 1 and 154 patients from Stage 2 showed effective B-cell 
depletion  (CD19+  lymphocyte  counts)  in  all  patients  analysed  at  baseline.  This  finding  was 
expected  as  the  dataset  consists  entirely  of  peripheral  blood  counts  from  patients  who  were 
receiving rituximab in the maintenance setting, and who had responded to a minimum of four cycles 
of 375 mg/ m2 rituximab IV in induction and who also had received at least one cycle of rituximab 
IV in the maintenance setting prior to enrolment into the study. 
B-cells were still depleted in 26 patients (14 IV and 12 SC) enrolled in Stage 2 with data available 
at the 3-month follow-up visit. Data of only 5 patients are available at the 9-month follow-up visit. 
B-cells started to recover in 3 patients. This is consistent with the trend seen previously in patients 
with haematological malignancies treated with rituximab IV, where B-cell recovery begins within 6 
months of treatment and generally returns to normal levels within 12 months after completion of 
therapy.  
B-cell count: Study BO22334 induction phase 
In Study BO22334, patients with previously untreated FL entered the study and received their first 
cycle  of  rituximab  intravenously.  Absolute  CD19+  lymphocyte  counts  were  available  from  102 
patients at baseline (pre-dose Cycle 1; 51 in the rituximab SC arm and 54 in the rituximab IV arm), 
with median CD19+ lymphocyte counts were around the lower limit of the normal range: 0.12 × 109 
cells/L (rituximab SC) and 0.05 × 109 cells/L (rituximab IV). Significant depletion of peripheral B 
cells was observed in both groups following the first cycle of rituximab IV treatment, and B-cell 
levels continued to deplete with additional cycles of induction treatment in both SC and IV groups

The clinical pharmacology was adequately addressed.  
Data describing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics was obtained from two studies, 
BP22333 and BO22334. The assay measuring rituximab in serum used in studies BP22333 and 
BO22334 were adequately validated and there was no impact on the assay on the presence of 
rHuPH20. Assays used for measuring rHuPH20 activity, anti-rituximab antibodies, anti-rHuPH20 
antibodies and neutralizing anti-rHuPH20 antibodies have been satisfactorily validated. 
Standard and appropriate PK analysis methods were used and only 0.5% of post-dose rituximab 
concentrations were below the quantification limit. 
The intended injection site is the abdominal wall; no other sites were investigated in the clinical 
studies. Dose-selection was based on data from stage 1 in study BP33222 where doses of 375 - 800 
mg/m2 were evaluated. Model simulation of PK data obtained from this study form the basis for the 
choice of the fixed dose of 1400 mg.  
A non-compartmental analysis of PK data suggested that a dose between 625 and 800 mg/m2 
would be required to achieve non-inferiority of R-SC to R-IV with a high variability of Ctrough > 
50%, this is justified by concentration-time data from Stage 1 of study BP22333. The PK model 
simulated the impact of various fixed doses (1100-1400 mg) on Ctrough and AUC in patients in the 
induction and maintenance settings and the fixed dose of 1400 mg R-SC in the model provided the 
highest probability of success on the expected geometric mean ratio and the lower and upper limit 
of the 90% confidence interval for Ctrough and AUC and was carried on to the Stage 2 of Study 
BP22333, the dose confirmation part to be compared to R-IV 375 mg/m2, q2m or q3m. Results 
showed that the PK model (combining PK data from stage 1 and 2) predicted Ctrough and AUC 
values were similar to the observed values. The modelling of PK data showed that the primary 
outcome, lower limit of Ctrough > 0.8, was achieved. GMR (90% CI) of Ctrough at q2m was 1.24 
(95%CI 1.02-1.51) and at q3m 1.12 (90% CI 0.86-1.45). GMR (90% CI) for AUC was at q2m 1.35 
(95% CI 1.23-1.49) and for q3m 1.35 (90% CI 1.23-1.48). The median Cmax of both the q2m and 
q3m regimen were similar for the i.v. and s.c. administration.  
The results from study BO22334, stage 1, where the dosing regimen was q3w (induction treatment) 
instead of q2m and q3m (maintenance treatment), confirmed the results from study BP22333. 
Rituximab SC was non-inferior to rituximab IV regarding Ctrough with a GMR 1.62 (90% CI 
1.36-1.94) with the upper limit exceeding 1.25%/1.37%. Exposure was higher in terms of AUC with 
SC administration (1.38; 90% CI 1.24-1.53). 
Overall, the flat dose of 1400 mg R-SC for the maintenance and induction treatment of FL provided 
Ctrough concentrations which were non-inferior to 375 mg/m2 R-IV. The bioequivalence guideline 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr**) states that for highly variable drugs, where the 
intra-subject variability > 30%, the acceptance criteria for BE (80-125%) can be widened to a 
maximum of 69.84-143.19 for Cmax. However; for AUC the criteria should be within 80-125% 
regardless of variability. The present application does not fulfil the BE criteria in a strict sense but 
was supported by clinical endpoints (Study BO22334).  
Volume of distribution was in the range normally seen with other antibodies, i.e. 3-4 L. In the popPK 
analysis the central volume in the SC route of administration was increased by 48.9%; however this 
did not impact the overall description of the data. It is generally accepted that monoclonal 
antibodies are eliminated by catabolism or target-mediated processes and not by hepatic metabolic

clearance or renal excretion. The initial clearance was as expected higher due to higher tumour 
burden at the start (target mediated clearance) than at later times at steady-state (non-specific 
clearance) where the tumour burden has diminished. The median terminal the half-life was 29.7 
days (range 9.9-91.2 days). 
The most important covariate was body surface area. Subgroup analysis (induction setting, q3w) 
showed that R-SC was non-inferior to R-IV in terms of Ctrough and AUC, meaning that patients with 
both low and high BSA sustained an acceptable level of rituximab in the blood. Exploratory analysis 
on the impact of BSA on safety and efficacy revealed no evidence that patients, with low BSA and 
therefore relatively higher rituximab concentration would present with more adverse events 
compared to patients with higher BSA. Likewise, patients with high BSA and relatively lower 
rituximab concentration showed no signs of reduced efficacy. The PK of rituximab, when 
administered subcutaneously, is not supposed to be influenced by renal and hepatic impairment 
and no such studies were conducted.  
Mabthera was granted a full waiver for paediatric studies in the context of the NHL indication 
therefore the PK of rituximab in children was not evaluated (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).  
In conclusion, the PK of R-SC was comparable to R-IV. R-SC was non-inferior to R-IV in terms of the 
primary endpoint Ctrough in Study BP22333 (cycle 2, maintenance treatment) and Study BO22334 
(cycle 7, induction treatment). The increased exposure seen with R-SC compared to R-IV did not 
raise safety concerns, but this should be considered in the light of the limited number of patients 
involved in general and in particular the limited number of patients that have received the proposed 
posology in combination with a relatively short follow-up (see also safety section for further 
information and discussion). There may also be a very high estimated exposure upon rituximab SC 
monotherapy in the patients with the stage III-IV FL with refractory disease or upon the ≥ 2 
relapse, where the patients are planned to receive Rituximab SC every week for 4 weeks. This 
would involve a Ctrough of at least 1.9 times that of rituximab IV, with an even higher exposure in 
patients with a low BSA. This also in relation to the uncertainty on the consequences for safety of 
this estimated high exposure. Based on this concern expressed by the CHMP, the Applicant 
withdrew this part of the indication. This has been considered acceptable provided the applicant 
mentions in section 4.4 of the SmPC that it is not recommended to treat patients that meet the 
indication of “MabThera monotherapy in the treatment of  patients with stage III-IV follicular 
lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after 
chemotherapy.” with MabThera SC. In addition, the Applicant has updated the educational material 
to address this issue.  
R-SC was as effective in the depletion of B-cells as R-IV as measured by CD19+ lymphocyte counts 
that remained depleted throughout study BP22333. In study BO22334, during the induction 
treatment, B-cell levels continued to fall. The overall response rate (ORR) at the end of the 
induction period was evaluated according to different subgroups comparing R-SC and R-IV. No 
statistical significant difference between R-SC and R-IV in terms of ORR was seen for Ctrough (low, 
medium, high), AUC (low, medium, high), BSA (low, medium, high), gender, CHOP/CVP and 
tumour load (low, medium, high). Overall, the pharmacodynamics is not different between sc and 
iv formulation.  
Extrapolation of data between indications within the scope of NHL, seems possible as pharmacology 
of rituximab is not expected to be different in the relapsed, stage III-IV FL patients, even 
considering the different dosing interval of once a week as compared to every 3 weeks. However, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014

the concomitant estimated mean Ctrough levels have a considerably higher ratio of 1.9, which 
means it is even higher in subjects with low BSA. Such a high exposure has not been tested in the 
current studies, whereas underexposure in the various HL indications will not be an issue, (to be 
further discussed under Clinical safety) 
2.4.8.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK data from study BP33222- stage 1 form the basis for the model simulation and the choice of 
the fixed dose of 1400 mg (see section 4.2 
In the absence of comparative safety data in the stage III-IV FL treatment setting with once a 
week rituximab SC 1400 mg for 4 weeks the proposed indication was revised not to include 
monotherapy and a statement in section 4.4 of the SmPC that it is not recommended to treat 
patients in the context of the indication of “MabThera monotherapy in the treatment of  patients 
with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or 
subsequent relapse after chemotherapy.”

Study BO22334 
Study BO22334 is a two-stage phase III, international, multicenter, randomized, controlled, 
open-label study to investigate the PK, efficacy and safety of rituximab SC in combination with 
CHOP or CVP versus rituximab IV in combination with CHOP or CVP in patients with previously 
untreated FL followed by maintenance treatment with either rituximab SC or rituximab IV.

Methods 
Study Participants  
Previously untreated patients aged ≥ 18 years with CD20-positive FL Grade 1, 2, or 3a were 
randomized. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomized into the following two treatment groups: 
Rituximab SC: first cycle rituximab IV (375 mg/m2) plus 7 cycles of rituximab SC in combination 
with up to 8 cycles of CHOP or CVP chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks.  Rituximab SC was 
given at a fixed dose of 1400 mg as determined in the Phase Ib study BP22333.  Patients achieving 
at least partial response (PR) at the end of induction entered rituximab SC maintenance therapy 
once every 8 weeks for 96 weeks. 
Rituximab IV: 8 cycles of rituximab IV in combination with up to 8 cycles of CHOP or CVP 
chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks.  Patients achieving at least PR at the end of induction 
entered rituximab IV maintenance therapy once every 8 weeks for 96 weeks. Rituximab IV was 
used at the standard dose of 375 mg/m2.   
Objectives 
The primary objective of Stage 1 was to estimate the ratio of Ctrough of rituximab obtained at 
Cycle 7, 21 days after SC administration to that obtained after IV administration 
(Ctrough(SC)/Ctrough(IV) during Cycle 7 of induction treatment). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of Stage 1 was to estimate the ratio of trough serum concentrations of 
rituximab obtained at Cycle 7, 21 days after SC administration to that obtained after IV 
administration (Ctrough(SC)/Ctrough(IV) during Cycle 7 of induction treatment).

Secondary endpoints of Stage 1 included additional PK parameters, B-cell depletion, safety, and the 
following efficacy parameters: 
ORR, comprising CR, CRu and PR, at the end/completion of induction treatment 
Complete response rate (CRR, comprising CR and CRu) at the end/completion of induction 
treatment 
ORR and CRR at the end/completion of maintenance treatment 
Time-to-event efficacy endpoints: progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival (EFS), and 
overall survival (OS). 
Patients had a final response assessment based on clinical examination and CT scans after 
completion of induction therapy.  Patients achieving CR, CRu, or PR according to the International 
Working Group response criteria for lymphoma entered the rituximab maintenance phase of the 
study and continued to receive either rituximab SC (1400 mg) or rituximab IV (375 mg/m2), 
depending on which treatment group they were initially randomized to, every 8 weeks for 96 weeks.  
All efficacy endpoints were analyzed according to the ITT population. 
Sample size 
Under the assumption of a coefficient of variation (CV) equal to 0.56 and assuming that the true PK 
of rituximab sc formulation is 5% above the rituximab iv formulation (ie mean Ctrough, sc to be 
above 5% above ctrough, iv)  50 patients in each treatment arm were adequate in order to achieve 
80% power with one-sided alpha of 0.05 (ie. 2-sided 90% CI ). Assuming that 20% of patients 
would not have valid PK data at cycle 8 pre-dose, a total of approximately 125 patients were to be 
enrolled into stage 1 of the study. Approximately 125 patients were to be enrolled in sttage1 plus an 
additional 125 enrolled patients to obtain 100 evaluable patients in case an adjustment of the 
rituximab SC dose was needed followed by approximately 280 patients to stage 2 (once recruitment 
for Stage 1 was completed and the rituximab sc dose confirmed. 
In stage 1 an interim PK futility analysis was planned after 35 patients in each treatment arm had 
completed cycle 7 of induction treatment. The interim analysis followed a group sequential design 
proposed by Lan –DeMets with an alpha spending function according to O’Brien and Flemming. If 
the results showed overwhelming evidence of futility of rituximab sc over iv the sc dose would need 
to be adjusted and an additional 125 patients would be enrolled in Stage 1. Otherwise, recruitment 
of stage 1 would be accomplished as planned. 
A total of 405 patients to be randomized in the study: approximately 125 patients in Stage 1, and 
approximately 280 patients in Stage 2. 
Randomisation 
Screening/baseline tests were performed within 28 days before randomization.  A central 
randomization procedure was used for all patients that fulfilled the entry criteria at screening.  
Patients were stratified by underlying chemotherapy backbone during induction treatment (CHOP, 
CVP), Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) (low-risk, intermediate-risk, 
high-risk) and regions (Europe and North America, South and Central America, Asia).  Study visits 
were planned on the first day of drug administration of each new treatment cycle.  Assessments 
included clinical tumor assessment, physical examination, vital signs, weight, hematology, serum 
chemistry, urinalysis, rituximab PK samples, peripheral blood sample for flow cytometry testing,

anti-rituximab antibody sample (HACA), and anti-rHuPH20 antibody sample (HAHA).  PK 
assessments are performed at pre-specified time points.  Assessment of tumor response was 
performed according the International Working Group response criteria for non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphomas. 
Patients underwent interim staging after receiving 4 cycles of induction immunochemotherapy.  
Response assessment was based on clinical examination and computed tomography (CT) scans.  
Patients achieving a complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu), or a PR, or 
with stable disease (SD) according to the International Working Group response criteria for 
lymphoma (Cheson et al., 1999) continued induction treatment.  Patients receiving CHOP 
chemotherapy could receive an additional 2 or 4 cycles of CHOP according to investigator discretion.  
Patients receiving CVP chemotherapy received an additional 4 cycles of chemotherapy.  Rituximab 
(SC or IV, respectively) was administered for a total of 8 cycles during induction therapy for all 
patients. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study BO22334 was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Response rates (ORR and CRR) at the end/completion of induction treatment were analyzed in 
frequency tables including 95% two-sided Pearson − Clopper confidence intervals (CIs) by 
treatment group For the difference in response rates, 95% two-sided CIs (Hauck − Andersen) were 
calculated. 
All efficacy endpoints were analyzed according to the intent-to-treat (ITT) population which 
included all patients being randomized into the study irrespective of whether they received study 
drug or not.  Patients were analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned. 
A numerical comparison of point estimates and 95% CIs for ORR for both treatment groups was 
deemed appropriate, given the anticipated non-inferior Ctrough levels with rituximab SC compared 
with rituximab IV.

Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and GCP guidelines. 
An IMC independent from the study management team was established which performed the 
interim PK futility after 35 patients were completed cycle 7 of induction treatment.  
Baseline data 
Overall, the treatment arms were balanced with respect to age, height, and weight at induction 
baseline.  The median age was 57.0 years (range 35 − 85 years) in the rituximab IV arm and 
54 years (range 28 − 85 years) in the rituximab SC arm.  The median height in each treatment arm 
was 167 cm (range 141 − 192 cm in the rituximab IV arm and 145 − 188 cm in rituximab SC arm), 
and the median weight was 71.5 kg (range 43.9 − 118.0 kg) in the rituximab IV arm and 70.0 kg 
(range 45.0 − 116.4 kg) in the rituximab SC arm. 
The median BSA was 1.82 m2 (range 1.34 − 2.30 m2) in the rituximab IV arm and 1.74 m2 (range 
1.37 − 2.32 m2) in the rituximab SC arm.  Overall, more female patients than male patients were 
randomized in this study (68/127 [54%] females vs. 59/127 [46%] males).  However, more 
patients were male in the rituximab IV arm (33/64 [52%]), whereas there were more female 
patients in the rituximab SC arm (37/63 [59%]) (Table 1). 
The baseline stratification characteristics of chemotherapy and FLIPI risk groups were 
well-balanced between the two treatment arms.  The greatest proportion of patients comprised of 
the intermediate and high-risk FLIPI groups (39% and 40%, respectively). The majority of patients 
had Ann Arbor Stage IV lymphoma at study entry, with 37/64 patients (58%) in the rituximab IV 
arm and 39/63 patients (62%) in the rituximab SC arm.  The greatest proportion of patients had 
Grade 2 FL (59/127 patients [46%]), followed by Grade 1 (39/127 patients [31%]) and 
Grade 3/3a (29/127 patients [23%]).  Slightly more patients in the rituximab IV arm had Grade 2 
FL (35/64 [55%] patients) compared to the rituximab SC arm (24/63 [38%] patients).

Numbers analysed 
The efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population for Stage 1, comprising all patients who 
completed the randomization process irrespective of whether they received study drug or not.  The

ITT population comprised 127 patients: 64 patients in the rituximab IV arm and 63 patients in the 
rituximab SC arm. 
One patient randomized to the rituximab SC arm, discontinued shortly after the first rituximab IV 
administration and was analyzed under the rituximab IV arm for analyses performed on the safety 
analysis population (SAP: 65 patients in the rituximab IV arm and 62 patients in the rituximab SC 
arm). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy Results for Study BO22334 
A total of 54/64 patients (84.4%, 95% CI [73.1%,92.2%]) in the rituximab IV arm achieved an 
overall response (including CR, CRu and PR) compared with 57/63 patients (90.5%, 95% CI 
[80.4%,96.4%]) in the rituximab SC arm.  A difference in ORR of 6.10% (95% CI [-6.3%,18.5%]) 
was observed in favor of the rituximab SC arm. 
A complete response (CR or CRu) was achieved by 19/64 patients (29.7%) in the rituximab IV arm 
and 29/63 patients (46.0%) in the rituximab SC arm. A difference in CRR of 16.34% (95% CI 
[−1.2%,33.9%]) was observed in favor of the rituximab SC arm. 
Patients with stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), missing information, and invalid 
information (ie, defined as any response assessment performed more than 56 days after the last 
cycle of rituximab, or after the first rituximab cycle of the maintenance phase, or after the start of 
new anti-lymphoma treatment were classified as non-responders.  The rate of non-response was 
15.6% (10/64 patients) in the rituximab IV arm compared with 9.5% (6/63 patients) in the 
rituximab SC arm, and comprised SD (4.7% in rituximab IV arm vs. 3.2% in rituximab SC arm), PD 
(1.6% vs. 0.0%, respectively), missing information (3.1% vs. 3.2%, respectively), and invalid 
information (6.3% vs. 3.2%, respectively).

Ancillary analyses 
Table 4 summarizes the results of the subgroup analyses of overall response rates by Ctrough (high 
vs. medium vs. low), AUC (high vs. medium vs. low), BSA (high vs. medium vs. low), gender (male 
vs. female), chemotherapy regimen (CHOP vs. CVP), and tumor load at baseline (high vs. medium 
vs. low).  In the majority of the subgroups analyzed, the ORR point estimates were numerically 
higher among patients treated with rituximab SC than those treated with rituximab IV.  Point 
estimates for ORR were numerically lower in the rituximab SC arm for patients with high Ctrough, low 
BSA, and female patients.  The interpretation of the subgroup analysis is limited by the small

Title: Sabrina study 
Study identifier 
Study BO22334, stage 1 
Design 
A two-stage phase III, international, multicenter, randomized, controlled, 
open-label study to investigate the PK, efficacy and safety of rituximab SC in 
combination with CHOP or CVP versus rituximab IV in combination with CHOP 
or CVP in patients with previously untreated FL followed by maintenance 
treatment with either rituximab SC or rituximab IV.

C though 
Rituximab SC: first cycle rituximab IV 
(375 mg/m2) plus 7 cycles of rituximab SC in 
combination with up to 8 cycles of CHOP or 
CVP chemotherapy administered every 
3 weeks.  Rituximab SC was given at a fixed 
dose of 1400 mg as determined in the 
Phase Ib study BP22333.  Patients achieving at 
least partial response (PR) at the end of 
induction entered rituximab SC maintenance 
therapy once every 8 weeks for 96 weeks. 
N = 63 rituximab SC arm (n = 40 receiving 
CHOP, n= 23 receiving CVP) 
Rituximab IV: 8 cycles of rituximab IV in 
combination with up to 8 cycles of CHOP or 
CVP chemotherapy administered every 
3 weeks.  Patients achieving at least PR at the 
end of induction entered rituximab IV 
maintenance therapy once every 8 weeks for 
96 weeks. Rituximab IV was used at the 
standard dose of 375 mg/m2.   
N = 64 rituximab IV arm (n = 40 receiving 
CHOP, n= 24 receiving CVP) 
The primary objective of Stage 1 was to 
estimate the ratio of Ctrough of rituximab 
obtained at Cycle 7, 21 days after SC 
administration to that obtained after IV 
administration (Ctrough(SC)/Ctrough(IV) during 
Cycle 7 of induction treatment).

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To investigate the efficacy of rituximab SC one study (study BO22334) was included. Study BO2234 
is a two-stage phase III, international, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study to 
investigate the PK, efficacy and safety of rituximab SC in combination with CHOP or CVP versus 
rituximab IV in combination with CHOP or CVP in patients with previously untreated FL followed by 
maintenance treatment with either rituximab SC or rituximab IV. The basis for submission for the 
line extension application was only data from stage 1 of the study (induction treatment). Stage 2 
(maintenance therapy) is ongoing. Stage 1 of the phase III study BO22334 has been conducted to 
demonstrate non-inferiority of rituximab SC 1400 mg to rituximab IV 375 mg/m2 in terms of Ctrough 
in FL induction and by extrapolating in the NHL indication. To evaluate the potential impact of the SC 
route of administration on the anti-lymphoma activity of rituximab in stage 1 of the study, a 
numerical comparison of point estimates and 95% CIs for ORR for both treatment groups at the end 
of induction was chosen as the primary parameter to exclude major differences in efficacy between 
rituximab SC and rituximab IV.  This approach was found acceptable given the anticipated 
non-inferior Ctrough levels with rituximab SC compared with rituximab IV.  The design of the study is 
found adequate. The population did not include children <18 years of age. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
It was concluded from the clinical pharmacology data that R-SC was non-inferior to R-IV in terms of 
the primary endpoint Ctrough in Study BP22333 (cycle 2, maintenance treatment) and Study 
BO22334 (cycle 7, induction treatment). However; the overall exposure, in terms of AUC, was 
about 40% higher in the R-SC compared to the R-IV. 
The efficacy results from study BO22334 showed that an ORR = 84.4%, 95% CI [73.1; 92.2] in the 
rituximab IV arm and 90.5%, 95% CI [80.4; 96.4] for the rituximab SC army, P-Value (Chi-squared 
Test) = 0.3002. The numerical comparison of point estimates and 95% CIs for ORR for both 
treatment groups at the end of induction did not show major differences between rituximab SC and 
rituximab IV. The numerical comparison of point estimates and 95% CIs for ORR for both treatment 
groups at the end of induction did not show major differences between rituximab SC and rituximab 
IV. 
Furthermore, a CRR of 29.7 %, 95% CI [ 18.9 ; 42.4]  was observed for the IV arm and 46.0%, 95% 
CI [ 33.4; 59.1] for the SC arm, P-value (Chi-sq. test) = 0.0575. The higher percentage of CRR in 
the rituximab SC arm compared to the rituximab IV arm may be due to the bigger exposure with the 
SC formulation.  
Data generated in patients with follicular lymphoma can be extrapolated to the other NHL 
indications using the same dose and regimens. In this aspect it is agreed that extrapolation of the 
induction efficacy results in FL to treatment of CD20+diffuse large B-cell NHL can be done, due to 
the same regimen and dose. However, concerning the proposed maintenance therapies and the 
induction therapy in combination with chemotherapy, the regimens are different from the induction 
monotherapy therapy in relapsed stage III-IV follicular lymphoma. For the latter, extrapolation was 
not considered sufficiently evident by the CHMP, and further justification was requested. The 
underlying assumption of the PK bridging approach was that attaining rituximab serum Ctrough 
levels with the SC formulation at least as high as those achieved with established IV dose would 
result in a non-inferior degree of target-site saturation and the same degree of efficacy, regardless 
of the route of administration. The idea is that the target tissue is never underexposed in 
Assessment report

comparison to an already established exposure reached by IV dosing, i.e. there is, from a scientific 
perspective, not a higher chance of development of resistance. Another underlying assumption of 
this clinical bridging approach is that the anti-lymphoma activity of rituximab would not depend on 
the underlying B-cell malignancy. The effect size of rituximab in FL appears sufficiently large in 
order to be a ”sensitive model” to detect potential differences between rituximab SC and IV as 
regards efficacy. Based on the comparative IV/SC PK data in study BO2234, the PK following weekly 
administration can be modelled. As pharmacology of rituximab is not expected to be different in the 
relapsed, stage III-IV FL patients, extrapolation seems possible even considering the different 
dosing interval of once a week as compared to every 3 weeks. However, the concomitant estimated 
mean Ctrough levels have a considerably higher ratio of 1.9, which means it is even higher in 
subjects with low BSA. Such a high exposure has not been tested in the current studies. This would 
mean that underexposure in the various HL indications will not be an issue, but the safety profile 
corresponding to an unequivocally high Ctrough level may be. This would prevent the extrapolation 
to the stage III-IV FL indication at this time. Comparative safety data in the stage III-IV FL 
treatment setting with once a week rituximab SC 1400 mg for 4 weeks, are not available at this 
time, this part of the indication was withdrawn. It is of importance to highlight the reasons for 
excluding this indication and appropriate statements that it is not recommended to treat patients 
that meet the indication of “Mabthera monotherapy in the treatment of patients with stage III-IV 
follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after 
chemotherapy” with Mabthera SC are included in section 4.4. The educational material should also 
reflect this issue (see RMP). 
Efficacy endpoints are only included as secondary endpoints in the provided results from stage 1 of 
the study BO22334. The endpoints ORR, CRR, PFS and OS are accepted as relevant efficacy 
endpoints, however; only ORR and CRR are provided. The most compelling endpoints; PFS and OS 
are not available at this point in time. Due to the increased exposure of rituximab SC long term 
safety issues which potentially could influence the overall survival cannot be excluded. Timelines 
with regard to the provisions of PFS and OS data have been agreed.

Safety data in support of the registration of rituximab solution for subcutaneous injection 
(rituximab SC) 1400 mg are available from three studies, as in table 1.  Data are presented per 
individual trial. 
Table 23. Summary of studies contributing to safety evaluation of rituximab 
SC.
Patient exposure 
A total of 1413 cycles of rituximab SC were administered to 303 patients across the three studies 
(table 24 and 25), of which 1215 cycles were with the 1400 mg dose. Among 182 patients with NHL 
who received at least one cycle of rituximab SC at the final selected dose of 1400 mg, 165 patients 
received at least three sequential cycles of rituximab SC 1400 mg, and 130 patients received five 
sequential cycles of rituximab SC 1400 mg. Overall, 70 patients were treated with rituximab SC 
1400 mg for at least 12 months: 63 patients in Stage 2 of Study BP22333, and 7 patients in Stage 
1 of Study BO22334.

In Stage 1 of study BP22333, the Stage 1 SAP comprised 124 patients (16 patients rituximab IV 375 
mg/m2 [Cohort A], 34 patients rituximab SC 375 mg/m2 [Cohort B], 34 patients rituximab SC 625 
mg/m2 [Cohort C], and 40 patients rituximab SC 800 mg/m2 [Cohort D]). At the time of clinical 
cut-off  (March  07,  2012),  the  median  observation  time  was  22  months.  A  total  of  43  patients 
participated in the optional SC extension phase (15 patients Cohort B, 12 patients Cohort C, and 16 
patients  Cohort  D),  and  opted  to  receive  rituximab  SC  1400  mg  for  their  remaining  cycles  of 
maintenance  treatment.  These  patients  were  analysed  according  to  the  randomized  treatment 
initially received. 
In  Stage  2  of  study  BP22333,  at  the  time  of  clinical  cut-off  (March  07,  2012),  the  median 
observation time was 15 months among the Stage 2 SAP (77 patients rituximab SC vs 77 patients 
rituximab IV). The treatment groups were generally well balanced in terms of median treatment 
duration (14.8 months rituximab SC vs 13.8 months rituximab IV). The median number of cycles of 
rituximab received was 8 in the rituximab SC group and 6 in the rituximab IV group (randomization 
was  not  stratified  according  to  previous  numbers  of  rituximab  IV  cycles  prior  to  study  entry). 
Patients  receiving  rituximab  SC  1400  mg  (fixed  dose)  had  a  higher  median  cumulative  dose  of 
rituximab than patients receiving rituximab IV 375 mg/m2 (i.e. 9800 mg rituximab SC vs 4620 mg 
rituximab IV). The median duration of the rituximab SC administration was 5.9 minutes. 
Study BO22334 
In Stage 1 of study BO22334, at the time of reporting (database snapshot date: June 12, 2012), the 
median  duration  of  observation  for  the  Stage  1  SAP  (62  patients  rituximab  SC  vs  65  patients 
rituximab IV) was approximately 9 months and similar across the treatment groups (8.8 months 
rituximab SC vs 8.7 months rituximab IV). The median duration of treatment was similar across 
both treatment groups (8.6 months rituximab SC vs 8.5 months rituximab IV). The median number 
of cycles of rituximab received was 10 in both groups, and the median cumulative dose of rituximab 
received was 13190 mg in the rituximab SC group (fixed dose) and 6667 mg in the rituximab IV 
group (BSA-adjusted dose). The median duration of rituximab SC administration was 6.1 minutes. 
Exposure to chemotherapy was similar across treatment groups among patients receiving CHOP 
(N=80) and among those receiving CVP (N=47). 
Study BO25341 
In Part 1 of CLL study BO25341, 64 patients were enrolled to receive rituximab IV at Cycle 5 and a 
test  dose  of  rituximab  SC  at  Cycle  6  of  treatment,  in  combination  with  FC  chemotherapy.  Five 
patients  discontinued  treatment  prior  to  Cycle  5,  including  one  patient  who  died  soon  after 
enrolment. Three patients were withdrawn after their rituximab IV infusion at Cycle 5 and hence did 
not receive rituximab SC at Cycle 6. One patient enrolled to receive 1870 mg rituximab SC at Cycle 
6 received only 1000 mg rituximab SC in error. The SAP at Cycle 6 comprised 56 evaluable patients 
(16 patients rituximab SC 1400 mg, 17 patients rituximab SC 1600 mg, 22 patients rituximab SC 
1870 mg, and 1 patient rituximab SC 1000 mg). At the time of clinical cut-off (April 04, 2012), the 
median duration of observation was 7.4 months. 
Adverse events 
 The  safety  data  from  the  three  studies  (BP22333,  BO22334  and  BO25341)  are  summarized 
individually, since the studies differed substantially in terms of study design, indication (NHL vs 
Assessment report

CLL), treatment setting (induction vs maintenance), extent of prior exposure to rituximab, dosage 
and duration of treatment. 
An overview of safety of rituximab SC 1400 mg compared with rituximab IV 375 mg/m2 in the two 
NHL studies (Stage 2 of Study BP22333 and Stage 1 of Study BO22334) is presented in table 26. 
The table summarizes the key safety findings in the induction setting, when previously untreated 
NHL  patients  received  rituximab-CHOP/rituximab-CVP  immunochemotherapy  (Study  BO22334, 
Stage 1), and in the maintenance setting, when patients responding to prior induction treatment 
received rituximab maintenance (Study BP22333, Stage 2). Some broad trends can be seen across 
the studies as follows: Aside from the occurrence of administration – related reactions (ARRs), the 
rituximab SC 1400 mg and rituximab IV 375 mg/m2 treatment groups in each study were balanced 
with respect to the proportion of patients experiencing AEs, Grade ≥ 3 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading 
to withdrawal. One death was recorded in each of the rituximab SC treatment groups, and both 
deaths were considered unrelated to study treatment. The difference in the safety profile regarding 
ARRs across the SC and IV treatment groups reflects the expected change in the ARR profile as a 
result of the subcutaneous route of administration. An ARR was defined as any AE occurring during 
or within 24 h of infusion/injection that was considered by the investigator to be related to the study 
drug. 
Table 26. Overview of safety in NHL studies BP22333 (Stage 2) and BO22334 (Stage 1). 
The key AE findings for study BP22333 are summarized below: 
In Stage 2 of study BP22333, 79% of patients per treatment group experienced at least one AE. The 
incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal of treatment was also balanced 
following treatment with rituximab SC or rituximab IV. There were no fatal AEs in either treatment 
group. ARRs were reported more commonly in the rituximab SC group (difference 27%). However, 
all ARRs were non-severe and non-serious events and mainly local injection site reactions reflecting 
the expected change of the ARR profile when switching to the subcutaneous route of administration. 
The overall profile of AEs  reported in Stage 2 of the study was similar following treatment with 
either rituximab SC or rituximab IV. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 66/103 
 
 
  
  
 
The AE with the highest incidence was administration-related reactions (ARRs: 31% rituximab SC 
vs 4% rituximab IV). By system organ class (SOC), the most commonly reported AEs occurred in 
the SOC infections and infestations (43% rituximab SC vs 56% rituximab IV). Other SOCs in which 
AEs  were  commonly  reported  included  gastrointestinal  disorders  (31%  rituximab  SC  vs  17% 
rituximab IV), injury, poisoning and procedural complications (36% rituximab SC vs 12% rituximab 
IV; which includes ARRs), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (25% rituximab SC 
vs  22%  rituximab  IV).  The  majority  of  events  reported  across  the  treatment  groups  were 
NCI-CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 events. The treatment groups were balanced with respect to the incidence 
of Grade ≥3 AEs (18% rituximab SC vs 17% rituximab IV). The highest incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs 
was reported in the SOC blood and lymphatic system disorders (3% rituximab SC vs 6% rituximab 
IV). Besides Grade ≥3 neutropenia (3% [2 patients] per group), the incidence of other Grade ≥3 
AEs reported was no more than 1% (i.e. 1 patient). No Grade 5 events were recorded. 
Key AE findings for study BO22334 are: 
In Stage 1 of study BO22334, the proportion of patients reporting AEs was comparable between the 
rituximab  SC  group  and  the  rituximab  IV  group  (92%  vs  88%,  respectively).  The  proportion  of 
patients with Grade ≥3 AEs and SAEs was comparable across treatment groups. There was one 
Grade 5 AE of myocardial infarction that was considered unrelated to treatment in a patient treated 
with rituximab SC. ARRs were more common among patients treated with rituximab SC (difference 
18%) (Section 5.4), however, the ARRs were mainly mild or moderate injection site reactions that 
are considered expected when switching to the subcutaneous route of administration. The overall 
safety profile of rituximab SC was similar to that of rituximab IV, and no new clinically relevant 
safety signals were identified. 
Key AE findings for the single cycle administration in study BP22333 and study BO25341 are: 
During the single cycle of randomized treatment in Stage 1 of study BP22333, aside from ARRs, the 
incidence and types of AEs were similar across treatment groups. There were no clear trends related 
to event incidence or intensity/seriousness and dose of study drug administered (rituximab SC 375, 
625, or 800 mg/m2). The most common AE by preferred term was ARRs (1/16 patients rituximab 
IV,  7/34  patients  rituximab  SC  375  mg/m2,  8/34  patients  rituximab  SC  625  mg/m2,  and  9/40 
patients  rituximab  SC  800  mg/m2).  The  majority  of  events  reported  were  Grade  1  or  2  events. 
There were very few Grade 3 AEs recorded (1/16 patients rituximab IV [appendicitis], 2/34 patients 
rituximab SC 375 mg/m2 [neutropenia and diarrhoea], and 2/40 patients rituximab SC 800 mg/m2 
[influenza and lung infection]), with no Grade ≥3 AEs reported in the intermediate-dose (rituximab 
SC 625 mg/m2) group. There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 AEs recorded. 
During the single cycle of rituximab SC in Part 1 of CLL study BO25341, more patients experienced 
at least one AE with higher doses of rituximab SC (7/16 patients rituximab SC 1400 mg, 10/17 
patients  rituximab  SC  1600  mg,  and  18/22  patients  rituximab  SC  1870  mg  [and  1/1  patient 
rituximab SC 1000 mg]). However, a similar variation was observed at the previous cycle (Cycle 5, 
IV administration), during which patients were dosed according to BSA. The majority of events in 
each treatment group at Cycle 6 were Grade 1 or 2 events. The treatment groups were balanced 
with respect to the incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs (3/16 patients rituximab SC 1400 mg, 4/17 patients 
rituximab SC 1600 mg, and 3/22 patients rituximab SC 1870 mg [and 1/1 patient rituximab SC 
1000 mg (dosing error)]). The highest incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs was reported in the SOC of blood 
and lymphatic system disorders, with neutropenia experienced by 2/16 patients in the rituximab SC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 67/103 
 
  
  
 
1400 mg group and 3/22 patients in the rituximab SC 1870 mg group. No Grade 5 events were 
recorded.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There  were  no  Grade  5  AEs  in  Stage  1  or  Stage  2  of  study  BP22333.  A  total  of  21  SAEs  were 
reported for 20 patients in Stage 2 of study BP22333 (9/77 patients [12%] rituximab SC vs 11/77 
patients [14%] rituximab IV). Of note, the incidence of each preferred term was not reported in 
more than one patient per treatment group. There was one pregnancy reported, in a 40-year-old 
patient randomized to receive rituximab SC 1400 mg in Stage 2 of study BP22333. The patient 
became pregnant while on study and later experienced a spontaneous abortion (SAE). The patient 
had received eight cycles of maintenance treatment with rituximab SC on study prior to the event. 
Cycle 9 was delayed due to this event but was administered at a later point. 
A total of 54 SAEs were reported for 28 patients during Stage 1 of study BO22334 (14/62 patients 
[23%] rituximab SC vs 14/65 patients [22%] rituximab IV). By SOC, the most commonly reported 
SAEs overall were infection and infestations (6% rituximab SC vs 9% rituximab IV) and blood and 
lymphatic system disorders (11% rituximab SC vs 5% rituximab IV). The most commonly reported 
SAE was febrile neutropenia (10% [6 patients] rituximab SC vs 3% [2 patients] rituximab IV). Two 
of the six patients in the rituximab SC arm who reported febrile neutropenia had experienced SAEs 
of febrile neutropenia during the first cycle (rituximab IV). One of these patients reported a total of 
14  SAEs:  the  patient  experienced  a  massive  pleural  effusion  on  Study  Day  2  that  required  a 
thoracotomy with sequelae, including pneumonia, post-operative pain, and infection, all of which 
were reported as SAEs.  
Among  the  SAEs  reported  among  all  patients  in  the  rituximab  SC  group  during  Cycle  1  (when 
receiving rituximab IV), only SAEs of febrile neutropenia and abdominal pain were reported later 
during  Cycles  2  −  8  of  induction  (with  rituximab  SC).  During  the  single  cycle  of  randomized 
treatment in Stage 1 of study BP22333, three patients experienced SAEs (1 patient rituximab IV 
[appendicitis], 1 patient rituximab SC 625 mg/m2 [peripheral artery angioplasty], and 1 patient 
rituximab SC 800 mg/m2 [angina pectoris]). No SAEs were reported in the low-dose (rituximab SC 
375  mg/m2)  group.  During  the  single  cycle  of  rituximab  SC  treatment  in  Part  1  of  CLL  study 
BO25341,  two  patients  in  the  rituximab  SC  1600  mg  group  experienced  SAEs  (diarrhoea  and 
cholecystitis, respectively). No SAEs were reported in the other rituximab SC dose groups. 
Deaths 
In Stage 2 of study BP22333, there was one death reported: a 63-year-old woman randomized to 
the rituximab SC 1400 mg group was withdrawn from the study because of progressive disease and 
later died due to disease progression. The death occurred after the patient was withdrawn from the 
study  and  approximately  8  months  following  the  last  treatment  with  study  drug,  and  was  not 
considered related to the study drug. 
Two deaths were reported in Stage 1 of study BO22334, both among patients in the rituximab SC 
group. A 64-year-old female patient experienced a Grade 5 AE of myocardial infarction following 
Cycle  5  of  treatment;  the  death  was  considered  unrelated  to  study  drug.  A  62-year-old  female 
patient,  who  was  withdrawn  from  the  study  after  Cycle  9  (first  cycle  of  maintenance)  due  to 
progressive disease, subsequently died due to disease progression. 
Assessment report

There were no Grade 5 AEs recorded in Part 1 of CLL study BO25341 during the single cycle of 
rituximab SC treatment. There was one death of unknown reason in study BO25341 soon after the 
patient’s enrolment to the study and prior to receiving study drug. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Study BP22333 
There were no consistent trends or patterns of changes in haematology parameters. There were few 
relevant shifts from baseline.  
Study BO22334 
The  majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  showed  no  change  in  NCI-CTCAE  grade  for 
haematology test parameters during Stage 1. The number of patients whose haematology values 
worsened  during  Stage  1  and  shifted  to  NCI-CTCAE  Grade  3/4  is  summarized  in  table  27.  The 
highest number of shifts to Grade 3/4 was observed for neutropenia for both treatment arms. The 
number of shifts to Grade 3/4 for lymphopenia and leukopenia was higher in the rituximab SC arm 
compared with the rituximab IV arm.

Serum Chemistry 
Study BP22333 
Uric acid levels displayed a consistent shift from baseline for rituximab SC across all dose groups. In 
Stage 1, there were 7, 6, and 6 patients in Cohorts B through D, respectively, who experienced a 
shift from Grade 0 at baseline to Grade 3 at end of treatment. There were no similar shifts for Cohort 
A. In Stage 2, there were 8 and 14 patients in Cohorts E and F, respectively, who experienced a shift 
from  Grade  0  at  baseline  to  Grade  3  at  end  of  treatment.  These  shifts  were  not  considered  as 
medically relevant. 
Other chemistry parameters did not show consistent trends or change patterns. 
Study BO22334 
There were very few shifts to Grade 3/4 for blood chemistry parameters, and for these parameters, 
there was little difference between the two treatment arms. 
B-cells 
Study BP22333 
A summary of B-cell depletion for patients in Stage 2 of Study BP22333 is presented. Analysis of 
CD19+  lymphocyte  subsets  showed  suppression  of  B-cells  in  both  study  arms  at  baseline  and 
continued B-cell suppression throughout the study. 
Available  data  from  124  patients  in  Stage  1  and  154  patients  in  Stage  2  confirmed  effective 
depletion of CD19+ cells in all patients at baseline. This is to be expected as the dataset consists 
entirely of peripheral blood counts from patients who had responded to a minimum of four cycles of 
375  mg/m2  rituximab  IV  in  induction  and  also  had  at  least  one  cycle  of  rituximab  IV  in  the 
maintenance setting prior to enrollment into the study. 
In Stage 1, available CD19+ lymphocyte counts from patients at the 9-month follow/up visit showed 
an  increase  in  B-cell  levels  at  this  time  point  compared  with  previous  time  points,  with  median 
counts of 0.05 ×109 cells/L (Cohort A, n=6), 0.03 ×109 cells/L (Cohort B, n=16), 0.02 ×109 cells/L 
(Cohort C, n=15), and 0.03 ×109 cells/L (Cohort D, n=7). 
Among those patients enrolled in Stage 2 with available CD19+ lymphocyte counts at the 9-month 
follow-up visit, an increase in B-cell levels could be seen in 3 rituximab IV patients and 2 rituximab 
SC patients at that time point, with median B-cell counts of 58 cells/mm3 (range 0 - 75 cells/mm3) 
and 33 cells/mm3 (range 1 - 65 cells/mm3), respectively. Although the sample size is limited, the 
results are consistent with the trend seen previously in patients with haematological malignancies 
treated with rituximab IV, where B-cell recovery begins within 6 months of treatment and generally 
returns to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy; although in some patients, 
this may take longer. 
Study BO22334 
Data on B-cell levels showed similar trends across the treatment arms, with significant depletion of 
peripheral B-cells following the first cycle of rituximab IV and continued depletion with additional 
cycles of induction treatment.

Absolute CD19+ lymphocyte counts were available from 102 patients at baseline (pre-dose Cycle 1; 
48 patients in the rituximab SC arm and 54 patients in the rituximab IV arm), with median CD19+ 
cell counts of 0.12 ×109 cells/L (range 0.00 - 27.12 ×109 cells/L) for the rituximab SC arm and 0.05 
×109 cells/L (range 0.01 - 25.48 ×109 cells/L) for the rituximab IV arm (normal range: 0.08 - 0.616 
×109  cells/L).  Analysis  of  CD19+  lymphocyte  counts  following  Cycle  1  (IV)  showed  effective 
depletion of B-cells in both treatment arms by Cycle 2, with median counts of 0.00 ×109 cells/L in 
both treatment arms pre-dose at Cycle 2 (range 0.00 - 8.23 ×109 cells/L [rituximab SC arm] and 
0.00 - 0.34 ×109 cells/L [rituximab IV arm]). Median counts pre-dose at Cycle 3 were 0.00 ×109 
cells/L in both treatment arms (range 0.00 - 0.05 ×109 cells/L [rituximab SC arm] and 0.00 - 0.11 
×109  cells/L  [rituximab  IV  arm]).  Median  B-cell  counts  remained  zero  in  subsequent  cycles 
indicating continued B-cell depletion over the treatment period.

Demographic variables 
Study BP22333 
In Stage 1 events were experienced by a higher proportion of patients in the >70 years of age group 
for  Cohort  E  than  Cohort  F  (93%  and  60%,  respectively).  The  two  cohorts  were  generally  well 
balanced in terms of AEs by all other patient characteristics examined. 
In Stage 2 Grade ≥3 AEs were experienced by a higher proportion of patients in the >70 years of 
age group for Cohort E than Cohort F (5 patients [36%] and 1 patient [10%], respectively). Within 
each  cohort,  a  higher  proportion  of  male  patients  than  female  patients  experienced  AEs  with  a 
Grade ≥3 (25% vs. 11% for Cohort E, and 28% vs. 11% for Cohort F). 
The two cohorts in stage 2 were generally balanced with respect to incidence of SAEs by the various 
subgroups. For the gender category, more male patients than female patients experienced SAEs 
(19%  of  males  in  each  cohort,  compared  with  11%  and  7%  of  females  in  Cohorts  E  and  F, 
respectively);  a  similar  trend  was  observed  for  Grade  ≥3  AEs.  For  patients  aged  >70  years,  a 
greater proportion of patients in Cohort E than in Cohort F reported SAEs (4 patients [29%] versus 
1 patient [10%], respectively). 
Study BO22334 
The treatment groups were generally well balanced in the subgroups for age, gender and race. More 
females than males experienced SAEs in both treatment groups (31% vs 12% for rituximab IV, and 
28% vs 15% for rituximab SC). 
Study BO25341 
AEs  in  Study  BO25341  are  summarized  by  age,  gender,  and  race  for  Cycle  5  and  Cycle  6.  The 
treatment groups were well balanced in terms of AEs with respect to demographic characteristics.

Body Surface Area 
In moving from a BSA-adjusted dosing approach with the IV formulation to a fixed-dose approach 
with  the  SC  formulation,  there  is  a  risk  that  patients  with  low  BSA  may  be  over-exposed  to 
rituximab, which could lead to potential safety concerns with rituximab SC, and that patients with 
high BSA could be under-dosed, which could lead to potential concerns around the clinical efficacy 
of  rituximab  SC.  Therefore,  key  safety  findings  (all-grade  AEs,  Grade  ≥  3  AEs,  and  SAEs)  were 
analysed in subgroups by BSA at baseline. 
Study BP22333 
In  Stage  2  of  Study  BP22333,  AEs,  Grade  ≥3  AEs,  and  SAEs  were  summarized  separately  for 
patients with low BSA and high BSA in Cohorts E and F (see table 28) Low BSA was defined as BSA 
≤1.6 m2 for female patients or ≤1.9 m2 for male patients, and high BSA was defined as BSA >1.6 
m2 for female patients or >1.9 m2 for male patients. There were 25 patients from Cohort E and 22 
patients from Cohort F with low BSA, whereas the high BSA subgroup was larger with 52 patients 
from Cohort E and 55 patients from Cohort F. 
BSA  did  not  affect  the  incidence  of  overall  adverse  events,  as  the  treatment  groups  remained 
balanced. In the low BSA group, overall event incidence was 80% and 86% for Cohorts E and F, 
respectively.  Similarly,  in  the  high  BSA  group,  overall  event  incidence  was  79%  and  76%, 
respectively. 
BSA did not affect the incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs, as the treatment groups remained balanced. In 
the low BSA group, overall event incidence was 12% and 14% for Cohorts E and F. Similarly, in the 
high BSA group, overall event incidence was 19% and 18%, respectively. 
There were no obvious differences in incidence and type of SAE with respect to the treatment cohort 
or BSA category. In the high BSA subgroup, SAEs were reported for 15% and 13% of patients in 
Cohorts E and F, respectively. In the low BSA subgroup, SAEs were reported for 12% and 9% of 
patients in Cohorts E and F, respectively.

Table 28. BP22333, Stage 2: Number of patients (%) with at least 1 AE, SAE or Grade ≥3 AE by 
BSA subgroups (SAP) 
Study BO22334 
For  Stage  1  of  Study  BO22334,  the  number  of  AEs  in  subgroups  based  on  BSA  at  baseline  is 
presented  in  table  29.  BSA  subgroups  in  this  study  were  defined  based  on  the  33rd  and  66th 
percentiles  for  BSA  at  baseline  among  the  study  population.  The  number  of  patients  in  these 
subgroups was relatively small (total 42 patients per BSA category from both  treatment arms). 
However, the groups were well-balanced in terms of all AEs, SAEs, and Grade ≥ 3 AEs irrespective 
of BSA at baseline. Patients with the lowest BSA having the highest exposure following rituximab SC 
administration did not appear to experience a higher incidence in AEs compared to the rituximab IV 
arm. There was no clear relationship between these subgroups and risk of experiencing an AE.

Exploratory logistic regression analysis of safety by BSA 
Overall, the median BSA among the study population in Study BO22334 was 1.81 m2 (range 1.34 
− 2.32 m2): median BSA was 1.82 m2 (range 1.34 − 2.30 m2) in the rituximab IV arm and 1.74 m2 
(range 1.37 − 2.32 m2) in the rituximab SC arm.  
To evaluate the assumption of homogeneity of the risk of having a SAE during the course of the 
study  between  rituximab  SC  and  rituximab  IV  with  BSA,  the  interaction  term  between  BSA 
(low/medium/high) and treatment effect (rituximab SC vs. rituximab IV) was included in a logistic 
regression model (table 30). The interaction term was non-significant for the risk of experiencing a 
SAE or a Grade ≥3 AE (p = 0.8422 and p = 0.5773, respectively), concluding that the treatment 
effects are homogeneous among the BSA categories. 
To  assess  the  nature  and  direction  of  the  interaction  from  a  clinical  perspective,  the  risk  of 
experiencing a SAE or a Grade ≥3 AE during the course of the study was examined for each BSA 
category. An overall assessment of the incidence of AEs across the three studies did not suggest a 
consistent association between BSA and risk of AEs (SAEs or Grade ≥3 AEs).

Table 30. BO22334: Subgroup analysis of safety by BSA. 
Of  note:  results  of  subgroup  analyses  should  be  regarded  with  caution,  given  the  possibility  of 
confounding by other baseline prognostic variables that could be associated with low BSA (e.g., 
older  age,  advanced  disease,  comorbidities),  the  risk  of  false-positive  findings  resulting  from 
multiple comparisons, sample size within subgroups (and therefore low statistical power), effects of 
co-administered chemotherapy, and the open-label study design. 
Study BO25341 
In study BO25341, low BSA was defined as BSA ≤1.6 m2 for female patients or ≤1.9 m2 for male 
patients,  and  high  BSA  was  defined  as  BSA  >1.6  m2  for  female  patients  or  >1.9  m2  for  male 
patients. Overall, there were 16 patients in the low BSA subgroup and 47 patients in the high BSA 
subgroup. 
From the available data, there were no obvious differences in incidence and type of Grade ≥3 AEs 
or SAEs with respect to the dose cohort or BSA category. 
Extrinsic 
No clinical information related to the safe use of rituximab SC during pregnancy or lactation or in 
children is available. 
Immunological events 
Administration-related reactions 
Administration-related reactions (ARRs) were considered as AEs of special interest. An ARR was 
defined as any AE occurring during or within 24 h of infusion/injection that was considered by the 
investigator to be related to the study drug. Across all studies, ARRs were reported more frequently 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014

after administration of rituximab SC than rituximab IV. ARRs consisted primarily of injection site 
reactions such as pain, swelling, and redness, and were generally of a mild (Grade 1 or 2) and 
transient  nature.  The  imbalance  regarding  ARRs  reflects  the  expected  change  in  ARR  profile 
associated with the SC route of administration and is assessed to be a change that is not medically 
relevant to the overall safety profile of rituximab.  
Below the ARRs are described per contributing study. 
Study BP22333, Stage 2 
The  incidence  of  ARR  events  was  higher  among  patients  in  the  rituximab  SC  group  than  in  the 
rituximab  IV  group  (24/77  patients  [31%]  vs  3/77  patients  [4%],  respectively).  The  most 
frequently occurring events were those in the SOCs of general disorders and administration site 
conditions  (18%  rituximab  SC  vs  3%  rituximab  IV),  followed  by  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue 
disorders  (17%  rituximab  SC  vs  0%  rituximab  IV),  and  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue 
disorders (6% rituximab SC vs 0% rituximab IV). Erythema was the most common ARR reported 
(13% rituximab SC), followed by injection site erythema and myalgia (each 5% rituximab SC). All 
remaining AEs were reported in < 5% of patients. All ARRs in the rituximab SC group were Grade 1 
events,  while  those  that  occurred  in  the  rituximab  IV  group  were  assessed  with  an  intensity  of 
Grade 1 or 2. 
Study BO22334, Stage 1 
The incidence of ARRs was higher in the rituximab SC group than in the rituximab IV group (31/62 
patients [50%] vs 21/65 patients [32%], respectively). The most commonly reported ARRs among 
patients in the rituximab SC group were injection site erythema (6 patients [10%]), erythema (5 
patients [8%]), pruritus (4 patients [6%]), and rash (4 patients [6%]). 
The majority of ARRs in both treatment groups were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity (95% rituximab SC vs 
98% rituximab IV). One patient in the rituximab IV group experienced a Grade 3 ARR of vomiting 
and was subsequently withdrawn from the study after repeated vomiting following their IV infusions 
at Cycles 4, 5, and 6. Three patients in the rituximab SC group experienced Grade 3 ARRs. Two of 
these  patients  experienced  a  Grade  3  ARR  following  their  first  SC  injection  at  Cycle  2  (Grade  3 
injection site rash and Grade 3 dry mouth). Both patients continued to receive further rituximab SC 
treatment  without  further  Grade  ≥3  ARRs.  The  third  patient  experienced  Grade  3  urine  output 
decrease  and  tumour  lysis  syndrome  (which  was  also  considered  serious),  however,  both  these 
events  were    experienced  on  Study  Day  2  following  the  Cycle  1  IV  infusion,  prior  to  receiving 
rituximab SC. 
Safety at Single Cycle of Rituximab SC 
During the single cycle of randomized treatment in Stage 1 of study BP22333, the incidence of ARRs 
was higher among rituximab SC cohorts (7/34 patients rituximab SC 375 mg/m2, 8/34 patients 
rituximab SC 625 mg/m2, and 9/40 patients rituximab SC 800 mg/m2) than for rituximab IV (1/16 
patients). The most frequently occurring ARRs were those in the SOC of skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders. Erythema was the most common ARR (2/34 patients rituximab SC 375 mg/m2, 
and 5/34 patients rituximab SC 625 mg/m2); no erythema events were reported in the IV group or 
in the highest rituximab SC dose group. All ARRs that occurred during the single cycle of treatment 
were Grade 1 or 2 events.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 76/103 
 
  
  
 
During Cycle 6 of treatment in CLL study BO25341, ARRs were experienced by 12 patients (2/16 
patients rituximab SC 1400 mg, 5/17 patients rituximab SC 1600 mg, and 5/22 patients rituximab 
SC  1870  mg).  The  majority  of  events  were  related  to  the  injection  site  (i.e.  injection  site  pain, 
erythema,  discoloration,  and  oedema).  Other  ARRs  included  abdominal  pain  (1/16  patients 
rituximab SC 1400 mg) and nausea (1/17 patients rituximab SC 1600 mg). Each of these events 
was assessed as Grade 1 or 2. 
Immunogenicity 
Monoclonal  antibodies  provide  highly  effective  therapies,  but  may  be  associated  with  unwanted 
effects  such  as  immunogenicity  (i.e.  they  induce  an  immune  response  in  patients).  Previous 
experience with rituximab IV showed the development of anti-rituximab antibodies to be an event 
of low incidence in NHL patients, i.e. 1.1% developed anti-rituximab antibodies. Retreatment of 
patients positive for anti/rituximab antibodies showed good results and no correlation was seen 
between the presence of this type of antibodies and loss of efficacy. 
The change of route of administration may influence the immunogenic potential of drugs; therefore 
the MAH included in the clinical program for rituximab SC a comprehensive assessment of human 
anti-chimeric  antibodies  (HACAs;  anti-rituximab  antibodies)  and  human  anti-human  antibodies 
(HAHAs; anti-rHuPH20 antibodies) following administration of rituximab SC versus rituximab IV. 
An analysis was performed to assess the impact of anti-rituximab and anti-rHuPH20 antibodies on 
AEs, ARRs, and events within the MedDRA SMQ Anaphylactic reactions (wide) in each of the studies.  
Anti-rituximab antibodies 
Regarding  the  safety  analysis  population  from  study  BP22333,  there  were  no  positive  human 
anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) samples at any time point during Stage 1,and only one patient had 
positive  HACA  results  during  Stage  2,  both  at  baseline  (pre-dose)  and  at later  time points.  The 
patient received a total of four rituximab SC doses as part of the study. Further HACA samples were 
not taken as the patient experienced disease progression and was withdrawn from study prior to 
entering follow-up. The PK parameters for this patient were within the expected range, and human 
antihuman antibody (HAHA) results were negative at the same time points. 
In study BO22334, ten of 124 (8.1%) patients had a positive HACA prior to receiving rituximab (2 
patients  in  the  rituximab  SC  arm  vs.  8  patients  in  the  rituximab  IV  arm).  Four  patients  (2  in 
rituximab  SC  arm  vs.  2  in  rituximab  IV  arm)  had  a  positive  HACA  after  baseline.  Two  of  these 
patients (1 patient in each treatment arm) had a positive HACA result at Cycle 2 following a positive 
HACA result at baseline. The PK data for the patient in the rituximab SC arm were within the normal 
expected range. The patient in the rituximab IV arm was withdrawn from the study with disease 
progression  following  Cycle  2.  The  other  two  patients  (1  in  each  treatment  arm)  had  a  positive 
HACA result following negative HACA results at baseline (i.e. at pre-dose Cycle 3), and the PK data 
for both of these patients were within the normal expected range. All other samples taken during 
the course of the study up until the clinical cut-off were negative for HACAs. 
Regarding the safety population from study BO25341, only one patient (in the 1870 mg rituximab 
SC dose group) among 59 patients tested had a positive result for HACA, at his follow-up month 6 
visit. This patient achieved a complete response at the end of treatment, and his rituximab serum

levels at the follow-up month 6 visit were below the limit of quantification, as seen for most patients 
at this visit. The patient had a rituximab PK profile as expected for Cycle 5, but during Cycle 6 his PK 
profile was lower than that for other patients who received the 1870 mg dose. At the time of clinical 
cut-off, there were no reports or indications of worsening of disease. 
Anti-rHuPH20 antibodies 
Study BP22333 
For the safety analysis population during Stage 1, six patients in Cohorts B through D (1, 2, and 3 
patients, respectively) had positive human anti-human antibody (HAHA) samples at baseline (prior 
to having received any rHuPH20). Five of these six patients also had a positive HAHA sample at one 
or  more  subsequent  time  points.  By  the  9-month  follow-up  visit,  positive  HAHA  samples  were 
recorded for 1 patient in each of Cohorts B and C. Positive HAHA samples were further tested using 
a neutralizing antibody assay. None of the patients who had positive HAHA samples tested positive 
for neutralizing antibodies.  
For the safety analysis population during Stage 2, five patients (6%) in the rituximab SC arm had 
positive HAHA samples at baseline. All five patients also had positive HAHA samples at later time 
points. In addition, one patient in the rituximab SC arm had a positive HAHA result at Visit 2, Day 
1 following negative HAHA results at baseline. The sensitivity of the HAHA assay is 1 ng/mL, with an 
expected “false positive” rate with a range of 4 − 11%. Positive HAHA samples were further tested 
using a neutralizing antibody assay. None of the patients who had positive HAHA samples tested 
positive for neutralizing antibodies. 
Study BO22334 
Thirteen of 123 (10.6%) patients (6 in the rituximab SC arm vs. 7 in the rituximab IV arm) had a 
positive HAHA result at baseline (pre-dose Cycle 1). This false-positive rate (10.6%) was within the 
expected range for this initial screening assay (4 − 11%). None of the patients with positive HAHA 
samples tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. 
During the course of the study until the clinical cut-off date, the number of patients with a positive 
screening assay for HAHAs ranged between 9 − 17% in the rituximab IV arm and 4 − 8% in the 
rituximab SC arm. The results of the neutralizing antibody assay were negative at all time points for 
these patients. 
Study BO25341 
Six of 56 patients (10.7%) had positive results for HAHAs. Four of these patients had a positive 
result for every time point where results are available, including at pre-dose Cycle 6 (i.e. prior to 
receiving their dose of rituximab SC). One patient in the 1400 mg rituximab SC dose group had a 
positive HAHA result at pre-dose Cycle 6 but was negative at all subsequent time points (results 
available until the follow-up month 3 visit). One patient in the 1870 mg rituximab SC dose group 
had a positive HAHA result at the Day 56 follow-up visit whilst having negative results for all other 
samples up to and including the sample at follow-up month 9. None of the patients who had positive 
HAHA samples tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Patients Retreated with Rituximab SC 
Forty-three patients participated in the optional SC extension phase in Stage 1 of study BP22333 
(15/34 patients from rituximab SC 375 mg/m2 cohort [Cohort B], 12/34 patients from rituximab SC 
625 mg/m2 cohort [Cohort C], and 16/40 patients from rituximab SC 800 mg/m2 cohort [Cohort 
D]). 
The incidence of AEs was similar across the three SC dose cohorts (8/15 patients from Cohort B, 
5/12  patients  from  Cohort  C,  and  9/16  patients  from  Cohort  D).  By  SOC,  the  most  commonly 
reported AEs occurred in the SOC infections and infestations (4/15 patients from Cohort B, 2/12 
patients from Cohort C, and 4/16 patients from Cohort D). All preferred terms within this SOC were 
reported  with  an  incidence  of  a  single  patient.  The  most  commonly  reported  AE  during  the  SC 
extension phase was administration-related reaction, recorded for 2/15 patients from Cohort B and 
1/16 patients from Cohort D. None of the ARRs reported were severe. 
Two patients from Cohort B and two patients from Cohort C experienced Grade ≥3 AEs during the 
SC extension phase. These AEs were pneumonia and neuralgia (Cohort B) and pyrexia and lung 
adenocarcinoma  (Cohort  C).  With  the  exception  of  neuralgia,  all  of  these  severe  AEs  were  also 
considered to be serious AEs. No Grade ≥3 AEs or SAEs were recorded for patients in Cohort D 
during the SC extension phase. 
Medication Error / Overdosage 
One patient received an overdose of rituximab as a result of a medication error in Stage 1 of study 
BO22334. A 58-year-old female patient was randomized to the rituximab IV group and received 50 
mL of rituximab IV (500 mg/50 mL) and 19 mL of rituximab SC (2280 mg) intravenously at her 
second cycle of maintenance treatment (Cycle 10). As a result, she received a total of 2780 mg of 
rituximab by IV infusion in addition to approximately 28000 U rHuPH20. The patient felt well with no 
obvious  complications  and  was  closely  monitored  afterwards.  The  patient  is  continuing  with 
rituximab treatment. Potential risks associated with medication errors and mitigation of those risks 
are addressed in the updated RMP. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Multiple cycles administered of the rituximab SC formulation 
In  Stage  2  of  study  BP22333,  a  total  of  eight  patients  (4/77  patients  [5%]  per  group)  were 
withdrawn from treatment due to an AE. In the rituximab SC group, patients were withdrawn from 
treatment  due  to  AEs  of  malignant  melanoma  (Grade  4  and  considered  an  SAE);  breast  cancer 
(considered an SAE); hypersensitivity (Grade 3); and rash vesicular (Grade 2). In the rituximab IV 
group,  patients  were  withdrawn  from  treatment  due  to  AEs  of  enterovesical  fistula  (Grade  2);

leukopenia (Grade 3); thrombocytopenia (Grade 4 and considered an SAE); and agranulocytosis 
(Grade 4 and considered an SAE). 
In  Stage  1  of  study  BO22334,  five  patients  were  withdrawn  from  treatment  due  to  AEs  (2/62 
patients [3%] rituximab SC vs 3/65 patients [5%] rituximab IV). In the rituximab SC group, one 
patient discontinued treatment due to dysphonia after Cycle 1 and another patient died due to the 
SAE  of  myocardial  infarction  following  Cycle  5.  In  the  rituximab  IV  group,  single  patients  were 
withdrawn  from  treatment  due  to  AEs  of  vomiting  (after  Cycle  6);  pneumonia  (after  Cycle  5, 
considered  to  be  an  SAE),  and  increased  levels  of  alanine  aminotransferase,  blood  alkaline 
phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase (after Cycle 2). 
Single cycle administration of the rituximab SC formulation 
Over Stage 1 of study BP22333, there was one patient withdrawn from treatment due to an AE (all 
SAEs) in each of the rituximab SC  cohorts (lung adenocarcinoma, spinal cord  compression, and 
squamous cell carcinoma). Importantly, the SAEs leading to withdrawal occurred after the patients 
had received further maintenance cycles by IV infusion. 
In Part 1 of CLL study BO25341, there were no AEs that led to withdrawal from study following 
treatment  administration  at  Cycle  6.  Three  patients  who  did  not  receive  rituximab  SC  were 
withdrawn  from  the  study  due  to  AEs  (2  patients  due  to  neutropenia,  and  1  patient  due  to 
Guillain-Barre Syndrome). 
Post marketing experience 
Rituximab SC is not a marketed formulation. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  data  from  the  three  studies  (BP22333,  BO22334  and  BO25341)  were  summarized 
individually, since the studies differed substantially in terms of study design, indication (NHL vs 
CLL), treatment setting (induction vs maintenance), extent of prior exposure to rituximab, dosage 
and duration of treatment.   
Overall, in study BP22333 the proportion of patients who experienced one or more AEs was similar 
following treatment with either rituximab SC or rituximab IV (e.g., 79% of patients in each arm for 
Stage 2).  The incidence of severe AEs (CTC Grade ≥ 3), SAEs and AEs leading to withdrawal of 
treatment was also balanced following SC and IV treatment.  There were no treatment-related fatal 
AEs in either treatment regimen.  
The incidence of ARRs was higher in the rituximab SC cohorts than in the rituximab IV cohorts, 
primarily due to a higher incidence of cutaneous reactions,  no ARRs were considered serious or 
severe.  With  the  exception  of  ARRs,  the  overall  profile  of  AEs  reported  was  similar  following 
treatment with either rituximab SC or rituximab IV. 
In  study  BO22334,  there  were  no  new  clinically  relevant  safety  signals  during  Stage  1  and  the 
safety profile of the rituximab SC and rituximab IV treatment arms was similar.  The proportion of 
patients reporting an AE of any grade during the study was 88% in the rituximab IV arm compared 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 80/103 
 
 
  
  
 
with 92% in the rituximab SC arm.  The total number of AEs reported was higher in the rituximab 
SC  arm  than  the  rituximab  IV  arm  (528  vs.  363,  respectively).    However,  the  majority  of  AEs 
reported in the rituximab SC arm and the rituximab IV arm were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity (86% vs. 
89%,  respectively).  The  proportion  of  patients  with  Grade ≥ 3  AEs  and  SAEs  was  similar  across 
treatment  arms.  No  new  safety  signals  were  observed.  A  higher  incidence  of  ARR  events  the 
majority being Grade ≤ 2 and were primarily cutaneous reactions with local site reactions. 
Overall in study BO25341 Cycle 5, the three rituximab SC treatment groups were balanced with 
respect to the number of patients experiencing at least one AE, and the majority of events in each 
treatment group consisted of CTC Grade 1 or 2 events. In Cycle 6, more patients experienced at 
least  one  AE  with  higher  doses  of  rituximab  SC  (7  patients  [44%],  10  patients  [59%]  and  18 
patients  [82%]  for  the  1400  mg,  1600  mg  and  1870  mg  rituximab  SC  groups,  respectively).  
However, this apparent dose effect must be considered in light of the low patient numbers and a 
similar variation in Cycle 5 (IV administration), where more patients in the 1870 mg rituximab SC 
group  experienced  AEs.  In  both  Cycle  5  and  Cycle  6,  the  treatment  groups  were  balanced  with 
respect to the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs and SAEs. ARRs were experienced by more patients in 
Cycle 6 (rituximab SC) than Cycle 5 (rituximab IV), the majority were related to the injection site 
(i.e. injection site pain, erythema, discolouration and edema) and were Grade ≤ 2.   
Study  BO25341  compared  several  SC  doses,  although  not  in  the  target  indication,  implying  a 
dose-relationship  of  the  adverse  events,  and  is  considered  as  a  potential  signal  towards  a 
dose-dependent  effect,  especially  for  neutropenia/leukopenia  and  for  erythema  and  other 
administration-related reactions. This is included in the RMP.  
A higher incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed for the rituximab SC arm in study BO22334: 
From Cycles 2 to 8 of induction treatment (i.e., patients receiving either IV or SC rituximab, plus 
combination chemotherapy), neutropenia was reported in 20/64 patients (31%) in the IV cohort 
and 21/62 patients (34%) in the SC cohort (thus not being of a real difference). Of those, 12/64 
patients (19%) in the IV cohort and 15/62 patients (24%) in the SC cohort experienced severe 
events.  Febrile neutropenia was reported in 2/64 patients (3%) in the IV cohort and 5/62 patients 
(8%) in the SC cohort. The difference in incidences  (2/64 vs 5/64) is inconclusive as to whether it 
is  a chance effect and highlights the difficulties of assessing the data. 
The incidence of administration-related reactions (ARRs) was higher in the rituximab SC cohorts 
than in the rituximab IV cohorts, primarily due to a higher incidence of cutaneous reactions, none of 
them  serious  or  severe.    This  finding  was  consistent  throughout  the  studies.  While  clinically 
manageable, it is nevertheless relevant in light of the primary claim for the SC formulation, i.e. 
convenience for the patient and the healthcare professional. Administration-related reactions and 
local  events  like  erythema,  pruritis,  and  also  systemic  reactions  like  cough  or  dyspnoea  were 
reported and can be considered related to the subcutaneous administration of rituximab SC 
As regards the fixed dose schedule, there is a risk that patients with low BSA may be over-exposed 
to rituximab, which could lead to potential safety concerns with rituximab SC, and that patients with 
high BSA could be under-dosed, which could lead to potential concerns around the clinical efficacy 
of rituximab SC. In patients with low BSA, the geometric mean ratio in study BO22334 at Cycle 7 
was higher than in the medium BSA and high BSA subgroups. However, there were no important 
differences between the rituximab IV and rituximab SC groups in terms of SAEs or Grade ≥ 3 AEs. 
An overall assessment of the incidence of AEs across the three studies did not suggest a consistent 
association between BSA and risk of AEs (SAEs or Grade ≥ 3 AEs), neither from a statistical nor from 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 81/103 
 
  
  
 
a clinical perspective. From the data available rituximab SC does not seem to have a differential 
safety profile in the different BSA subgroups specific to rituximab. As rituximab primarily targets 
B-cells and tumour cells, it may not necessarily depend on body weight or BSA. 
As regards immunogenicity, , this has been among the main potential concerns for subcutaneously 
administered  rituximab.  The  immunogenicity  or  rituximab  SC  was  remarkably  low.  The  most 
probable  explanation  is  that  rituximab  targets  B-cells  and  thus  the  main  effector  for  producing 
anti-rituximab antibodies; thus, rituximab reduces its own immunogenicity by a pharmacodynamic 
effect. The immunogenicity of rituximab for example in rheumatoid arthritis (lower doses), may be 
different and although this indication is not applied for, it is an important risk as regards potential 
off-label use and is reflected in the RMP. 
Occurrence  of  anti-rHuPH20  antibodies  was  infrequent  and  appeared  not  to  be  linked  to  any 
apparent safety finding. 
In  the  event  that  specific  anti-rHuPH20  antibodies  are  generated  in  patients,  their  biologically 
relevant  impact  could  potentially  include  autoimmunity  responses  resulting  in  attenuation  of 
fertility  via  one  or  more  mechanisms.  In  adult  males,  anti-sperm  antibodies  could  theoretically 
interfere  with  sperm  maturation,  motility,  or  transport.  In  females,  anti-sperm  antibodies  could 
impede  progress  through  the  cervix  and  uterus,  facilitate  sperm  agglutination,  or  block  normal 
processes that facilitate sperm-egg interactions. However, current literature suggests no cause and 
effect relationship exists between presence of anti-sperm antibodies and infertility in humans. The 
Applicant will provide follow-up data from immunogenicity analyses on anti-rHuPH20 antibodies as 
part of all three studies. An effect is unlikely but not known at this stage.  
While the immunogenicity of rituximab SC was low, with the current dataset, it cannot be excluded 
if re-administration of rituximab SC for further cycles in the further course of treatment could be 
hampered,  e.g.  be  linked  to  occurrence  of  safety  issues  or  loss/lack  of  efficacy.  There  was  no 
association  between  the  detection  of  HACAs  and  adverse  events,  efficacy,  pharmacokinetics,  or 
pharmacodynamics parameters. Further data will be submitted to confirm this aspect (see RMP) 
It should be noted that these data and conclusions cannot be extrapolated to immunogenicity in 
rheumatoid arthritis (not applied for). There are no data on patients treated with rituximab SC that 
were previously treated already with the SC route of administration; the specific question of HACA 
incidence (and potential consequences) after re-administration of rituximab SC upon relapse can 
only be addressed within the scope of post approval studies as set out in the Annex II. 
In  conclusion,  patients  receiving  rituximab  SC  1400  mg  had  a  higher  median  cumulative  dose, 
compared with those receiving rituximab IV, and thus a higher exposure. This was also observed for 
trastuzumab  SC.  The  overall  assessment  of  safety  was  challenging  due  to  the  limited  safety 
database,  the  underlying  severe  disease  condition,  the  short  follow-up,  and  different  disease 
characteristics in the three studies submitted. The current safety database for rituximab SC does 
not give rise to specific concerns. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No new adverse drug reactions have been seen with the safety profile with rituximab sc.

Premedication with intravenous glucocorticoid 
significantly reduced the incidence and

Routine: for WG and MPA patients, 
glucocorticoids are given in combination with 
rituximab as part of the specified indication.  
Infectionsa 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states: 
Serious infections, including fatalities, can 
occur during therapy with MabThera. 
MabThera should not be administered to 
patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. 
tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic 
infections) or severely immunocompromised 
patients (e.g. in hypogammaglobulinemia or 
where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). 
Physicians should exercise caution when 
considering the use of MabThera in patients 
with a history of recurring or chronic infections 
or with underlying conditions which may 
further predispose patients to serious 
infection. Patients reporting signs and 
symptoms of infection following MabThera 
therapy should be promptly evaluated and 
treated appropriately. Before giving a 
subsequent course of MabThera treatment, 
patients should be re-evaluated for any 
potential risk for infections. 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states: Physicians 
should review the patient’s vaccination status 
and follow current immunization guidelines 
prior to MabThera therapy. Vaccination should 
be completed at least 4 weeks prior to first 
administration of MabThera.The safety of 
immunization with live viral vaccines following 
MabThera therapy has not been studied. 
Therefore vaccination with live virus vaccines 
is not recommended whilst on MabThera or 
whilst peripherally B cell depleted.  
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states: Use of 
MabThera maybe associated with an increased 
risk of Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy (PML). Patients must be 
monitored at regular intervals for any new or 
worsening neurological symptoms or signs 
that may be suggestive of PML. If PML is 
suspected, further dosing must be suspended

trials with MabThera monotherapy given for 4 
weeks, haematological abnormalities occurred 
in a minority of patients and were usually mild 
and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) 
neutropenia was reported in 4.2 %, anaemia 
in 1.1 % and thrombocytopenia in 1.7 % of 
the patients. 
Section 4.4 states: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
screening, including HBsAg-status, 
HBsAb-status and HBcAb-status, should be 
performed in all patients before initiation of 
treatment with MabThera/Rituxan as per 
institutional guidelines. Patients with active 
hepatitis B disease should not be treated with 
MabThera/Rituxan. Patients with positive 
hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) 
should consult liver disease experts before 
start of treatment and should be monitored 
and managed following local medical 
standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states: Patients 
with a high tumour burden or with a high 
number (≥25 x 109/l) of circulating malignant 
cells such as patients with CLL , who may be at 
higher risk of especially severe cytokine 
release syndrome, should only be treated with 
extreme caution. These patients should be 
very closely monitored throughout the first 
infusion. Consideration should be given to the 
use of a reduced infusion rate for the first 
infusion in these patients or a split dosing over 
two days during the first cycle and any 
subsequent cycles if the lymphocyte count is 
still >25 x 109/L. 
Severe cytokine release syndrome is 
characterised by severe dyspnea, often 
accompanied by bronchospasm and hypoxia, 
in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, 
and angioedema. This syndrome may be 
associated with some features of tumour 
lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, 
hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, 
hyperphosphaetemia, acute renal failure, 
elevated Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 
may be associated with acute respiratory 
failure and death. The acute respiratory failure 
may be accompanied by events such as 
pulmonary interstitial infiltration or oedema, 
visible on a chest x-ray. The syndrome

frequently manifests itself within one or two 
hours of initiating the first infusion. Patients 
with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or 
those with pulmonary tumour infiltration may 
be at greater risk of poor outcome and should 
be treated with increased caution. Patients 
who develop severe cytokine release 
syndrome should have their infusion 
interrupted immediately (see section 4.2) and 
should receive aggressive symptomatic 
treatment. Since initial improvement of 
clinical symptoms may be followed by 
deterioration, these patients should be closely 
monitored until tumour lysis syndrome and 
pulmonary infiltration have been resolved or 
ruled out. 
Serious Viral Infectionsb 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states: 
None 
Serious infections, including fatalities, can 
occur during therapy with MabThera. 
MabThera should not be administered to 
patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. 
tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic 
infections) or severely immunocompromised 
patients (e.g. in hypogammaglobulinemia or 
where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). 
Physicians should exercise caution when 
considering the use of MabThera in patients 
with a history of recurring or chronic infections

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be 
performed in all patients before initiation of 
treatment with MabThera. At minimum this 
should include HBsAg-status and 
HBcAb-status. These can be complemented 
with other appropriate markers as per local 
guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B 
disease should not be treated with MabThera. 
Patients with positive hepatitis B serology 
(either HBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver 
disease experts before start of treatment and 
should be monitored and managed following 
local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B 
reactivation. 
Opportunistic Infectionsa 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states: 
None 
Serious infections, including fatalities, can 
occur during therapy with MabThera. 
MabThera should not be administered to 
patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. 
tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic 
infections) or severely immunocompromised 
patients (e.g. in hypogammaglobulinemia or 
where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). 
Physicians should exercise caution when 
considering the use of MabThera in patients 
with a history of recurring or chronic infections 
or with underlying conditions which may 
further predispose patients to serious 
infection. Patients reporting signs and 
symptoms of infection following MabThera 
therapy should be promptly evaluated and

immunomodulatory drugs may increase the

experience with MabThera in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients ( a possible risk for the 
development of solid tumours cannot be 
excluded at this time, although present data 
do not seem to suggest any increased risk. 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states: There are 
no data on the safety of MabThera in patients 
with moderate heart failure (NYHA class III) or 
severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. 
In patients treated with MabThera, the 
occurrence of pre-existing ischemic cardiac 
conditions becoming symptomatic, such as 
angina pectoris, has been observed, as well as 
atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, in 
patients with a known cardiac history, the risk 
of cardiovascular complications resulting from 
infusion reactions should be considered before 
treatment with MabThera and patients closely 
monitored during administration. Since 
hypotension may occur during MabThera 
infusion, consideration should be given to 
withholding anti-hypertensive medications 12 
hours prior to the MabThera infusion.

Retreatment with MabThera 
Based upon investigator judgment, 15 
patients received a second course of 
MabThera therapy for treatment of relapse of 
disease activity which occurred between 6 and 
18 months after the first course of MabThera. 
The limited data from the present study 
preclude any conclusions regarding the 
efficacy of subsequent courses of MabThera in 
patients with Granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
and Microscopic polyangiitis.  
Continued immunosuppressive therapy may 
be especially appropriate in patients at risk for 
relapses (i.e. with history of earlier relapses 
and Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or 
patients with reconstitution of B-lymphocytes 
in addition to PR3-ANCA at monitoring).

Section 4.6 of the EU SmPC states: 
IgG immunoglobulins are known to

maternal exposure to MabThera have 
not been studied in clinical trials. 
There are no adequate and 
well-controlled data from studies in 
pregnant women, however transient 
B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia 
have been reported in some infants 
born to mothers exposed to rituximab 
during pregnancy. For these reasons 
MabThera should not be administered 
to pregnant women unless the 
possible benefit outweighs the 
potential risk. Due to the long 
retention time of rituximab in B cell 
depleted patients, women of 
childbearing potential should use 
effective contraceptive methods 
during treatment and for 12 months 
following MabThera therapy.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Rituximab as add-on to chemotherapy has become standard of care for neoplastic B-lymphocyte 
derived diseases such as follicular lymphoma, large cell B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia.  The  new  SC  formulation  in  which  rituximab  has  been  concentrated  12-fold  to 
120 mg/mL by the addition of recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) in order to facilitate 
the SC administration, is studied in a phase III, international, multicenter, randomized, controlled, 
open-label  study  (study  BO22334)  compared  to  the  iv  formulation  on  top  of  standard 
chemotherapy  CHOP  or  CVP  in  patients  with  previously  untreated  FL  followed  by  maintenance 
treatment with either rituximab SC or rituximab IV. At present only data from stage 1 of the study 
(induction treatment) has been presented. Stage 2 (maintenance therapy) is ongoing. 
The SC formulation of rituximab is considered at least as effective as the IV formulation as shown 
by the efficacy results from study BO22334; ORR = 84.4%, 95% CI [73.1; 92.2] in the rituximab IV 
arm  and  90.5%,  95%  CI  [80.4;  96.4]  for  the  rituximab  SC  arm,  P-Value  (Chi-squared  Test)  = 
0.3002. A CRR of 29.7 %, 95% CI [18.9; 42.4]  was observed for the IV arm and 46.0%, 95% CI 
[ 33.4; 59.1] for the SC arm, P-value (Chi-sq. test) = 0.0575. The numerical comparison of point 
estimates and 95% CIs for ORR for both treatment groups at the end of induction did not show 
major differences between rituximab SC and rituximab IV. Similar efficacy is also supported by PK 
data. 
Data generated in patients with follicular lymphoma can in principle be extrapolated to the other 
NHL indications using the same dose and schedule for rituximab. In that aspect it is agreed that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/7283/2014  
Page 99/103 
 
 
  
  
 
extrapolation of the induction efficacy results in FL to treatment of CD20+diffuse large B-cell NHL 
can be done. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
While ORR and  CRR are acceptable primary endpoints for the comparison of efficacy of the two 
rituximab  formulations,  time-dependent  endpoints,  such  as  PFS  and  OS  are  not  available  at 
present. Such data will be provided as part of the final study reports. 
The rituximab SC regimen for FL as maintenance therapy and as induction therapy combined with 
chemotherapy,  are  different  from  the  regimen  for  induction  monotherapy  in  the  relapsed  stage 
II-IV  FL  setting,  i.e.  maintenance  rituximab  SC  1400  mg  once  every  2  months  in  previously 
untreated FL, maintenance rituximab SC 1400 mg once every 3 months for relapsed-refractory FL 
vs rituximab 1400 mg SC as monotherapy for relapsed/refractory stage II-IV FL every week for 4 
weeks) and extrapolation to the induction monotherapy setting is not evident, therefore the this 
indication has been excluded from the treatment with the sc formulaiton.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
A total of 1413 cycles of rituximab SC were administered across the three studies submitted, 1215 
cycles of which were with the 1400 mg dose. Patients receiving rituximab SC 1400 mg had a higher 
median cumulative dose, compared with those receiving rituximab IV, which puts further emphasis 
on a comparative assessment of a potential impact of this on safety. 
The incidence of administration-related reactions (ARRs) was higher in the rituximab SC cohorts 
than in the rituximab IV cohorts, primarily due to a higher incidence of cutaneous reactions, none of 
them serious or severe.  This finding was consistent throughout the studies. While clinically 
manageable, it is nevertheless relevant in light of the primary claim for the SC formulation, i.e. 
convenience for the patient and the healthcare professional. ARRs and local events, like erythema, 
pruritis, and also systemic reactions, like cough or dyspnoea, were reported and can be considered 
related to the subcutaneous administration of rituximab SC. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher with sc as compared to the IV formulation, but this 
finding should be confirmed when a larger safety data base is available.  
Immunogenicity of subcutaneously administered rituximab was generally remarkably low, most 
probably due to administration of a B-cell depleting dose. However, uncentainties still exist and it 
cannot be excluded that re-administration of rituximab SC for further cycles in the further course of 
treatment could be hampered, due to occurrence of safety issues or loss/lack of efficacy and 
long-term immunogenicity especially upon re-exposure with rituximab later in the treatment course 
when initial cycles have been completed and the patient later relapses needs to be further 
elucidated. As a post-approval measure, a proposal regarding the investigation of immunogenicity 
upon re-administration of rituximab SC after relapse and will be discussed in the scope of Scientific 
Advice (Q4/2014). 
Long  term  safety  data  are  warranted  and  will  be  provided  as  agreed  through  relevant  post 
authorization measures (See Annex II).

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The applicant has demonstrated at least similar efficacy for the SC formulation of rituximab when 
the product is used in combination with standard chemotherapy for follicular lymphoma. This effect 
can be extrapolated to patients with large B-cell lymphomas since dose and schedule for rituximab 
are  identical.  SC  administration  of  rituximab  appears  to  be  more  convenient  for  the  patients 
although it is not a major difference as all cytostatic agents should still be administered via the IV 
route.   
The incidence of administration-related reactions (ARRs) was higher in the rituximab SC cohorts 
than in the rituximab IV cohorts, primarily due to a higher incidence of cutaneous reactions, none of 
them serious or severe.  Administration-related reactions and local events like erythema, pruritis, 
and also systemic reactions, like cough or dyspnea, were reported and can be considered related to 
the subcutaneous administration of rituximab SC.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit – risk balance of the subcutaneous formulation of Mabthera to be used for the treatment 
of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma in combination with 
chemotherapy; as maintenance therapy for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients 
responding to induction therapy and for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large 
B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy; is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Rituximab is standard of care for three important B-cell derived neoplastic diseases. The new SC 
formulation could be seen as an improvement in terms of patient care as compared to the IV 
formulation. At least equal efficacy has been demonstrated and, except from local reactions, the 
safety profile is considered similar at this time. Further data on efficacy in terms of time related 
endpoints, long term safety and immunogenicity of the subcutaneous formulation of rituximab will 
be provided from on-going trials.

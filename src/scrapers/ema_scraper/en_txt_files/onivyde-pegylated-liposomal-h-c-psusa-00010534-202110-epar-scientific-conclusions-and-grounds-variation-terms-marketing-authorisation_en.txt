Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for irinotecan (liposomal 
formulations), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on the Hypersensitivity reactions: Angioedema and Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid 
reaction and Skin reaction (Rash, Urticaria, Erythema and Pruritus) from clinical trials, the literature, 
spontaneous reports and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between irinotecan (liposomal formulations) and such reactions to be at least a reasonable 
possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing irinotecan 
(liposomal formulations) should be amended accordingly. 
In view of available data on drug-drug interactions (DDI) with flucytosine as a prodrug for 5-fluorouracil 
from the literature and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers an interaction 
between irinotecan (liposomal formulations) and flucytosine to be at least a reasonable possibility. The 
PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing irinotecan (liposomal formulations) 
should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for irinotecan (liposomal formulations) the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing irinotecan (liposomal 
formulations) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

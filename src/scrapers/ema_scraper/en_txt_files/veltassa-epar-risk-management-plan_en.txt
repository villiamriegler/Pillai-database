Centralised Procedure 
Chemical class:  
Veltassa is a highly cross-linked polymer of calcium 2-fluoroprop-2-
enoate with diethenylbenzene and octa-1,7-diene, combination with 
D-glucitol (RLY5016S), belonging to the pharmacologic class of 
potassium binders. The drug substance consists of the polymer anion 
(the active moiety, patiromer) and a calcium-sorbitol counterion 
complex. This polymer is insoluble in aqueous and organic solvent 
systems. 
Summary of mode of action:  
Veltassa is a non-absorbed, cation exchange polymer that contains a 
calcium-sorbitol complex as a counterion. 
Veltassa increases faecal potassium excretion through binding of 
potassium in the lumen of the GI tract. Binding of potassium reduces the 
concentration of free potassium in the GI lumen, resulting in a reduction 
of serum potassium levels. 
See Section 1.3.1. 
Proposed: Product Information. 
Current: Veltassa is indicated for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in 
adults and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. 
Current: The daily dose may be adjusted in intervals of 1 week or 
longer, based on the serum potassium level and the desired target range. 
Serum potassium should be monitored when clinically indicated. The 
duration of treatment should be individualised by the treating physician 
based on the need for serum potassium management. If serum potassium 
falls below the desired range, the dose should be reduced or 
discontinued. 
Adults  
The recommended starting dose is 8.4 g patiromer once daily. The daily 
dose may be increased or decreased by 8.4 g, as necessary to reach the 
desired target range, up to a maximum dose of 25.2 g daily. 
Adolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years 
The recommended starting dose is 4 g patiromer once daily. Adjust the 
daily dose of patiromer based on the serum potassium level and the 
desired target range, up to a maximum dose of 25.2 g daily. It is 
recommended to switch to 8.4 g patiromer sachets if doses above 7 g are 
needed.

SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION AND TARGET 
POPULATION 
SI.1 
Indication 
Epidemiology of the Disease 
Veltassa is indicated for the treatment of hyperkalaemia (high potassium level in the blood) 
in adults and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. 
Hyperkalaemia is a condition that occurs when serum potassium levels are above the upper 
limit of normal which can vary across studies, however >5 mmol/l or 5 mEq/l is a common 
definition.  In  clinical  studies  supporting  the  indication  of  Veltassa  for  the  treatment  of 
hyperkalaemia, a serum potassium >5 mmol/l or mEq/l was used for entry.  
Based  upon  2022  population  estimates,  there  are  447  million  persons  in  the  EU  and 
333 million in the US [1,2]. Using the estimated prevalence of 1.3%, the applicant estimates 
that  5.8 million  patients  will  present  with  hyperkalaemia  each  year  in  the  EU  and 
4.3 million in the US. 
The presence of hyperkalaemia in patients with declining kidney function can range from 
5% to 50% [3]. This condition can be dangerous and needs immediate medical attention to 
prevent possible complications. 
The most common cause of high potassium is a failing kidney. When the kidney function 
is significantly reduced, the kidneys cannot remove extra potassium from the body and this 
could  lead  to  potassium  build-up.  Other  causes  are  certain  drugs  (e.g.,  angiotensin 
converting  enzyme  inhibitors  (ACEIs),  potassium-sparing  diuretics,  and  other  renin 
angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi)), burns, heart attack, heart failure (HF), 
dehydration, diabetes, and internal bleeding to name a few [4]. 
Too much potassium in the blood can cause problems with how nerves communicate with 
the muscles. This can lead to weakness or even paralysis. High potassium levels can also 
affect  the heart and result in  an abnormal  heartbeat.  This  can be severe  and can lead to 
death. 
SI.1.1 
Incidence and Prevalence 
A  recent  pooled  analysis  of  542  articles  used  a  random-effects  model  to  estimate  the 
incidence and prevalence of hyperkalaemia in the general population [5]. In this analysis, 
prevalence  within  the  general  population  was  reported  to  be  1.3%  (1.0-1.8%)  and  the 
incidence was reported to be 0.4 (0.2-0.8) cases per 100 person-years.  
Based  upon  2022  population  estimates,  there  are  447  million  persons  in  the  EU  and 
333 million in the US [1,2]. Using the estimated prevalence of 1.3%, it can be estimated 
 
 
that  5.8  million  patients  will  present  with  hyperkalaemia  each  year  in  the  EU  and 
4.3 million in the US.  
While rare in the general population of healthy individuals with normal renal function, the 
prevalence of hyperkalaemia in patients with renal insufficiency or chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) ranges from 5% to 50% and increases as renal function declines [3,6]. 
SI.1.2 
Demographics of the Target Population (Age, Sex, Race/Ethnic 
Origin) 
Little evidence exists about the demographics of hyperkalaemia in the general population 
[7,8] and more is known about the profile of high risk patients, namely those patients with 
CKD and/or HF. 
SI.1.3 
Risk Factors for the Disease 
The patients most at risk of hyperkalaemia are those with compromised renal excretion of 
potassium. Clinical risk factors for hyperkalaemia include CKD, diabetes mellitus, HF and 
older age [9,10] as well as the use of medications that reduce serum potassium excretion, 
notably  RAASi  such  as  ACEIs,  angiotensin  II  receptor  blockers  (ARBs),  aldosterone 
antagonists,  angiotensin  receptor  neprilysin  inhibitors  and  renin  inhibitors  [11-16]. 
Hyperkalaemia and/or the concern about the development of hyperkalaemia is a common 
reason that use of these drugs is limited in patients with CKD and/or HF where they have 
been  shown  to  improve  clinical  outcomes  [17-20].  In  addition  to  CKD  and  the  use  of 
RAASi, diabetes and the use of beta blockers can increase the risk of hyperkalaemia leading 
to fatal cardiac arrhythmias [14]. 
Main Existing Treatment Options 
SI.1.4 
A consensus paper supported by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes describes 
the treatment options for both acute and chronic hyperkalaemia [21].  
In  acute  hyperkalaemia  (serum  potassium  levels  >6.0  mmol/l),  the  expert  panel 
recommended  treatment  in  a  facility  with  cardiac  monitoring,  typically  an  emergency 
department [22].  
Treatment  includes  intravenous  (IV)  calcium  if  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  changes  are 
present or if the serum potassium is >6.5 mmol/l. IV insulin/glucose and/or salbutamol are 
recommended  to  shift  potassium  intracellularly.  If  acidosis  is  present  without  volume 
overload,  sodium  bicarbonate  may  be  considered.  These  strategies  either  stabilise  the 
cardiac membrane (calcium) or temporarily shift potassium into the cells to rapidly lower 
the serum potassium (insulin/beta adrenergic agonists and bicarbonate) [22].  
Additional  adjunctive  therapies  to  treat  hyperkalaemia,  particularly  those  that  enable 
potassium elimination in a relatively short amount of time, would provide another option 
for  physicians  when  managing  hyperkalaemia  in  acute  settings.  IV  furosemide  can  be 
 
 
considered unless the patient has severe volume depletion or is anuric. Potassium binders 
can also be considered to facilitate elimination of the potassium via the GI tract. 
For  patients  in  whom  the  aetiology  of  hyperkalaemia  is  not  reversible  but  rather  more 
chronic in nature from underlying CKD and/or use of RAASi, the traditional approach to 
management  of  hyperkalaemia  has  relied  on  dietary  potassium  restriction,  RAASi  dose 
reduction or discontinuation, diuretics, oral  bicarbonate and if applicable, the use of the 
cation exchange resins sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) (Resonium AÂ®) and calcium 
polystyrene  sulfonate  (Calcium  ResoniumÂ®  99.934%  w/w  powder  for  oral/rectal 
suspension) [23]. 
A new potassium binder was approved in  the EU in  March 2018  and US in  May 2018; 
sodium  zirconium  cyclosilicate  (LokelmaÂ®)  is  insoluble,  non-absorbed,  formulated  as  a 
powder  for  oral  suspension,  and  acts  as  a  potassium-removing  agent  [24].  The  most 
common adverse reaction with Lokelma was mild to moderate oedema. Each 5 g dose of 
Lokelma  contains  approximately  400  mg  of  sodium.  In  placebo-controlled  trials  up  to 
28 days, oedema was reported in 4.4%, 5.9%, 16.1% of patients treated with 5 g, 10 g and 
15  g  of  Lokelma  once  daily,  respectively  versus  2.4%  of  patients  receiving  placebo. 
Because Lokelma can transiently increase gastric pH, there is the potential for drug-drug 
interaction.  In  general,  oral  medications  with  pH  dependent  solubility  should  be 
administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after Lokelma. Spacing is not needed if it 
has been determined the concomitant medication does not exhibit pH dependent solubility. 
The use of dietary potassium restriction to manage hyperkalaemia is difficult due to the 
ubiquitous  presence  of  potassium  in  foods.  Because  fat,  carbohydrates  (in  diabetics), 
sodium  and  phosphorus  tend  to  be  restricted  in  patients  with  CKD,  the  addition  of  a 
potassium  restriction  severely  limits  food  options,  often  resulting  in  noncompliance. 
Diuretics are a mainstay for managing sodium, water balance and hypertension, and are 
highly efficient at removing potassium in patients with normal renal function; however, the 
effectiveness  of  diuretics  is  greatly  diminished  in  patients  with  CKD.  Oral  sodium 
bicarbonate does not reduce total body potassium, is not highly effective in reducing serum 
potassium levels and has not been well studied for the treatment of hyperkalaemia [25]. For 
patients  who  are  receiving  RAASi  medications,  clinical  practice  guidelines  include  the 
possibility  of  dose  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  RAASi  medication  to  address 
hyperkalaemia;  however,  this  has  the  potential  to  attenuate  the  benefits  of  RAASi.  The 
most recent guidelines note that, âthe dose of ACEi or ARBs should only be reduced or 
discontinued as a last resort in patients with hyperkalaemia, after measures to control serum 
potassium have failed to achieve a normal serum potassium levelâ [21,26]. 
SPS is an ion-exchange resin that is indicated for the treatment of hyperkalaemia associated 
with anuria or severe oliguria or in  patients requiring dialysis and in patients on regular 
haemodialysis or on prolonged peritoneal dialysis. SPS is not well tolerated, and its use can 
be  associated  with  life-threatening  side  effects  including  intestinal  necrosis.  Further,  an 
appreciable sodium load can occur with treatment such that caution is advised when SPS 
is  administered  to  patients  in  whom  an  increase  in  sodium  load  may  be  detrimental 
 
 
(e.g., congestive HF, hypertension, renal damage or oedema) [27]. The poor tolerability of 
repeated use of SPS and the risks associated with the product limit its utility in patients 
with CKD and HF, where the incidence of hyperkalaemia is highest [23,27,28]. Based on 
these factors, a recent retrospective cohort study utilising population-level databases from 
Manitoba,  Canada  reported  low  frequency  of  SPS  prescription  after  an  episode  of 
hyperkalaemia  (â¥5.5  mmol/l)  in  adults  with  CKD  and  a  RAASi  prescription.  RAASi 
discontinuation or down titration was the most common approach to manage hyperkalaemia 
[28]. 
SI.1.5 
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Population, 
Including Mortality and Morbidity 
Hyperkalaemia  represents  a  serious  condition  that  can  result  in  life-threatening  cardiac 
arrhythmias and is associated with an increased mortality risk [3] in patients with CKD. 
Severity of CKD and a history of hyperkalaemia have also been shown to be a multiplier 
of risk for sudden cardiac death [3]. These facts underscore the need to treat this clinical 
condition. 
An elevation in the plasma (extracellular) potassium concentration decreases the ratio of 
intracellular  to  extracellular  potassium,  leading  to  partial  depolarisation  of  the  cell 
membrane. Hyperkalaemia accounts for considerable morbidity, e.g., it results in muscle 
weakness,  paralysis,  and  arrhythmias  such  as  ventricular  extra  systoles  and  fibrillation 
(ECG QRS widening), due to reduced myocardial conduction velocity. The effects on the 
conduction in the heart can become life-threatening and lead to sudden cardiac death. It is 
estimated that sudden cardiac death because of hyperkalaemia is the cause of death in 3-5% 
of dialysis patients [29].  
In a retrospective analysis of the annualised mortality rate of a cohort of US patients using 
data from Truven Health Analytics MarketScanÂ® Commercial and Medicare Supplemental 
Databases, populations of individuals with diagnoses of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and CKD 
Stage 3-5 during the 2009 baseline year was estimated (N=34,706). Mortality rates for the 
patient  subpopulation  meeting  patiromer  study  enrolment  criteria  were  estimated.  The 
crude  annualised  mortality  rate  was  6.52  deaths  per  100  patient-years.  This  was  further 
analysed  in  a  study  population  whose  hyperkalaemia  risk  profile  was  similar  to  those 
patients enrolled in Study RLY5016-205 and the adjusted crude annualised mortality risk 
was  7.05%  and  rate  was  7.30  deaths/100  patient-years.  The  observed  annualised  rate  in 
Study RLY5016-205 was 5.70 deaths/100 patient-years when the rate was calculated based 
on the total duration of subject exposure in the study, which did not exceed that estimated 
from the corresponding matched Truven Health Analytics subpopulation [30]. 
Important Comorbidities 
SI.2 
Hyperkalaemia usually occurs in patients with compromised renal excretion of potassium 
arising  from  reduced  renal  filtration  (i.e.,  reduced  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate) 
and/or tubular defects. 
 
 
Acute clinical conditions such as tumour lysis syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, crush injuries, 
massive  blood  transfusions  and  acute  renal  failure  can  each  lead  to  a  rise  in  serum 
potassium to dangerous levels. These acute clinical conditions require immediate treatment 
for hyperkalaemia, particularly when the degree of hyperkalaemia is severe (e.g., serum 
potassium â¥6.5 mEq/l) and/or associated with cardiac repolarisation disturbances. The risk 
of death is increased significantly in CKD patients with hyperkalaemia [3], underscoring 
the need to treat this clinical condition. 
Overall, the comorbidities in the population studied are representative of the target patient 
population at risk for hyperkalaemia, including patients who are elderly (>65 years old), 
have advanced stages of CKD and HF, carry a high burden of associated cardiovascular 
and other comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and ischaemic heart 
disease and are receiving typical concomitant medications expected for such a population 
including RAASi, beta blockers, digoxin, warfarin, diuretics, statins, hypoglycaemic agents 
and anti-platelet drugs [3].

target organ toxicity was identified. 
4-week and 39-week oral toxicity studies in dogs: No 
adverse clinical effects, and no toxicologically meaningful 
changes in clinical pathology (haematology, blood chemistry 
and urinalysis), anatomic pathologic evaluations (gross 
pathology, organ weight and histopathology), ophthalmic or 
ECG parameters were observed. Thus, the NOAEL for 
RLY5016 administered daily to dogs for 4 weeks 
was >7 g/kg/day; the NOAEL for RLY5016S administered 
daily to dogs for 39 weeks was determined to be 
3.75 g/kg/day (expressed as RLY5016). No target organ 
toxicity was identified.  
Reproductive/Developmental Toxicity 
Embryo/foetal development in rats: No RLY5016-related 
toxicity was observed in dams or litters of dams at oral doses 
up to 6 g/kg/day. 
Embryo/foetal development in rabbits: No 
RLY5016S-related toxicity was observed in dams or litters 
of dams at oral doses up to 3 g/kg/day (dose expressed in 
terms of RLY5016). 
Male and female fertility in rats: No RLY5016S-related 
toxicity was observed in male and female rats at oral doses 
up to 5 g/kg/day (dose expressed in terms of RLY5016). 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Data not available 
RLY5016 powder for oral suspension 
does not cause organ toxicity. 
RLY5016 powder for oral suspension 
has shown no evidence of 
embryonic/foetal toxicity, nor effects on 
reproductive function, development or 
fertility at dose levels up to 12-fold the 
MRHD (25.2 g/day). 
Animal reproduction studies are not 
always predictive of human response. 
RLY5016 powder for oral suspension is 
systemically not absorbed and has no 
systemic bioavailability and therefore is 
not expected to be excreted in human 
milk.

RLY5016 powder for oral suspension is 
systemically not absorbed, thus, there are 
no known or expected pharmacological 
effects on the organ system such as the 
liver or kidneys in humans. 
RLY5016 powder for oral suspension 
does not show any metabolic activation 
in mutant frequency or chromosomal 
aberrations, as well as showing 
non-mutagenicity in the in vivo 
micronucleus assay, therefore, RLY5016 
powder for oral suspension does not pose 
a genotoxic risk for humans. 
Nephrotoxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicology studies (short-term and chronic 
studies in rats and dogs) results were consistent with the 
non-absorbed nature of the polymer and its lack of systemic 
bioavailability. No target organ toxicity was identified. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicology studies (short-term and chronic 
studies in rats and dogs) results were consistent with the 
non-absorbed nature of the polymer and its lack of systemic 
bioavailability. No target organ toxicity was identified. 
Genotoxicity 
Bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay: The bacterial 
reverse mutation assay was conducted with Salmonella 
typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and 
Escherichia coli strain WP2uvrA in the absence and in the 
presence of metabolic activation. Concentrations of 
RLY5016 in the study ranged from 33.3â5,000 Âµg/plate. 
There were no test-article-induced increases in mutant 
frequency in any of the tester strains, either in the absence or 
in the presence of metabolic activation. 
In vitro mammalian chromosome aberration assay: The 
ability of RLY5016 to induce chromosome aberrations in 
Chinese hamster ovary cells was evaluated in the absence 
and presence of metabolic activation at concentrations of 
15.6â500 Âµg/ml and 31.3-500 Âµg/ml, respectively. There 
were no test-article-induced increases in chromosome 
aberrations in the absence or presence of metabolic 
activation. 
In vivo micronucleus assay: Male rats were administered a 
single oral dose of RLY5016 at 0, 1, 3 or 6 g/kg. The 
frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in 
the bone marrow was assessed at 24 hours (all doses) and at 
48 hours (high dose) after dosing. There were no test-article 
induced increases in the frequency of micronuclei in the 
bone marrow of RLY5016-treated rats; thus, RLY5016 was 
non-mutagenic in this assay.

General safety pharmacology findings from nonclinical studies are presented in  Table 2

Key Nonclinical Safety Findings - General Safety Pharmacology 
Key Safety Findings 
(From Nonclinical Studies) 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Cardiovascular System (Including Potential for QT Interval Prolongation) 
Cardiovascular assessment in dogs: Oral administration of 
RLY5016 at doses up to 3.5 g/kg in dogs produced no changes 
in cardiovascular parameters or ECG waveform measurements. 
Given the nonclinical data, RLY5016 
powder for oral suspension-related 
cardiovascular effects are not expected 
in humans.  
Respiratory System 
Pulmonary assessment in anaesthetised rats: Oral 
administration of RLY5016 at doses up to 6 g/kg produced no 
significant respiratory changes in rats when compared with 
vehicle-treated animals. 
Given the nonclinical data, RLY5016 
powder for oral suspension-related 
respiratory effects are not expected in 
humans. 
Central Nervous System 
Neuropharmacological profile in rats: Oral administration of 
RLY5016 at doses up to 6 g/kg in rats produced no changes in 
behavioural or physiological parameters. 
Gastrointestinal System 
GI motility assessment in rats: There were no 
RLY5016-related changes observed on GI transit at 1 and 
6 g/kg (oral gavage). However, administration of RLY5016 at 
3 g/kg produced a slight, but statistically significant (p<0.05) 
decrease of 23% in GI transit compared with the vehicle group. 
Oral administration of RLY5016 at 1 g/kg produced no effect 
on stomach emptying when compared with the vehicle-treated 
group. However, RLY5016 administered at 3 and 6 g/kg 
produced a statistically significant (p<0.01) decrease in 
stomach emptying, as demonstrated by an increase in stomach 
weight (plus content) when compared with the vehicle group. 
Given the large doses of RLY5016 administered in this study 
(approximately 0.5 g in the 3 g/kg dose group and 1 g in the 
6 g/kg dose group), residual RLY5016 in the stomach could be 
contributing to the significant increase (mean increase of 0.8 g) 
in the stomach weights (plus content) in these dose groups. 
Given the nonclinical data, RLY5016 
powder for oral suspension-related 
neurobehavioural effects are not 
expected in humans. 
The effects noted on stomach 
emptying are considered to be 
physical, as opposed to 
pharmacological effects. The 3 and 
6 g/kg doses used in this study are 
approximately 6- and 12-fold higher 
(on a weight basis) than the maximum 
daily dose of RLY5016 powder for 
oral suspension (25.2 g/day 
patiromer). Therefore, due to the large 
quantity of the RLY5016 administered 
to rats, this result is considered to not 
be reflective of similar response in 
humans.

Table 3 
Other Toxicity-Related Information 
Other Toxicity-Related Information 
Relevance to Human Usage 
RLY5016 powder for oral suspension 
is systemically not absorbed and has 
no systemic bioavailability. 
Quantitative whole-body 
autoradiography in rats did not detect 
any radiolabel outside the GI tract. 
Since the patiromer polymer is not 
systemically absorbed, DDI, if they 
occur, would arise through binding of 
the polymer to another orally 
administered drug in the GI tract 
leading to a decrease in absorption of 
the other drug. 
The results of the in vitro DDI studies 
identified oral medications that have 
the potential to be bound by RLY5016 
powder for oral suspension. The 
potential for DDIs was further 
evaluated in an extensive in vivo 
programme on healthy volunteers. 
As a precautionary measure, 
administration of patiromer should be 
separated by at least 3 hours from 
other oral medicinal products unless 
no interaction was confirmed in vivo. 
Bioavailability 
Two single-dose studies, 1 in rats and 1 in dogs, were 
conducted to verify that the RLY5016 polymer anion is not 
systemically absorbed after oral administration. These studies 
used 14C-labeled RLY5016 and demonstrated the non-absorbed 
nature of the polymer and its lack of systemic bioavailability. 
Drug-drug Interactions 
Binding of other orally administered drugs with RLY5016S 
was studied in vitro under conditions which mimic pH and 
cation conditions in different regions of the GI tract (pH 1.2, 
4.5 and 6.8). 
Significant interaction (>30% binding) under at least 1 study 
condition was observed in vitro with RLY5016S and the 
following drugs: ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, warfarin, 
cinacalcet, levothyroxine, clopidogrel, metformin, amlodipine, 
verapamil, lithium, quinidine, thiamine, quinapril, azilsartan, 
irbesartan, losartan potassium, olmesartan medoxomil, 
telmisartan, bisoprolol fumarate, carvedilol, metoprolol, 
nebivolol, finerenone, furosemide, torasemide and 
mycophenolate mofetil. 
To allow for a more realistic assessment of the DDI in the GI 
tract, a GI tract passage model was established and 7 drugs 
showing interaction with patiromer only at pH 1.2 were further 
tested in this model: quinapril, azilsartan, irbesartan, losartan 
potassium, olmesartan medoxomil, finerenone and torasemide. 
Adsorption to patiromer at pH 1.2 was reversible and declines 
as test drugs become neutral or negatively charged during GI 
tract passage. No interaction with patiromer with these 7 test 
drugs was observed in the GI tract model. 
No significant interaction under any study condition was 
observed in vitro with RLY5016S and the following drugs: 
acetylsalicylic acid, amoxicillin, cephalexin, apixaban, 
rivaroxaban, glipizide, allopurinol, atorvastatin, digoxin, 
phenytoin, riboflavin, benazepril, captopril, enalapril maleate, 
fosinopril, lisinopril, perindopril tert-butylamine, ramipril, 
trandolapril, candesartan cilexetil, valsartan, sacubitril, 
eplerenone, spironolactone, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, 
empagliflozin, bumetanide, tacrolimus and sevelamer.

SIII  CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
During the clinical development of patiromer, 2 different drug substances (RLY5016S and 
RLY5016) were used to produce drug product for the clinical studies. RLY5016 refers to 
the polymer anion with calcium as counterion; RLY5016 contained the patiromer anion, 
which is the active moiety of RLY5016S. The clinical trial code RLY5016 was changed to 
patiromer  after  the  submission  and  approval  of  Veltassa  (patiromer)  marketing 
authorisation. This change is reflected in this RMP. 
Duration of Exposure 
SIII.1 
Safety  data  from  2,135  study  participants  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  patiromer  in

POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL TRIALS 
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the 
Development Programme 
Table 14 highlights the populations excluded from clinical trials with patiromer. 
 
 
 
Table 14 
Exclusion Criteria 
Criterion 
Reason for Exclusion 
Considered to 
be Included as 
Missing 
Information? 
Rationale 
Known or suspected hypersensitivity 
to patiromer or any of its components. 
Enrolling subjects with known 
hypersensitivity to constituents of Veltassa 
would place these patients at increased risk 
for additional hypersensitivity reactions. 
No 
Use in pregnant and lactating women.  Pregnant or lactating women were not 
Yes 
enrolled in the clinical studies. 
Use in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
These patients were excluded from the 
clinical trials. 
No 
If the patient is known to have a history of hypersensitivity 
reactions to the active substance or to any of the excipients, 
patiromer should not be given. 
This exclusion criterion will remain as a contraindication.  
Wording is included in SmPC Section 4.3 Contraindications.  
Animal reproductive and fertility studies at dose levels up to 6- 
and 12-fold, in rabbits and rats, respectively, revealed no 
evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus, however, 
animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human 
response. 
There are no data from the use of patiromer in pregnant women. 
Patiromer is not absorbed systemically following oral 
administration, and maternal use is not expected to result in foetal 
risk. 
Patiromer is not absorbed systemically by the mother, so 
breastfeeding is not expected to result in risk to the infant. 
This is addressed in the SmPC, Section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy 
and lactation. 
This patient population was not the targeted population with 
hyperkalaemia but monitoring of hepatic enzymes was performed 
on all subjects in clinical trials regardless of their underlying 
comorbidities. 
No subject in the pooled studies permanently discontinued 
treatment with patiromer because of an AE related to an increase 
in hepatic enzymes or bilirubin. 
There are no known or expected pharmacological effects of this 
non-absorbed polymer on other organ systems such as the liver.

Use in immunocompromised patients.  Patients included in the clinical trials must 
No 
Use in patients with a history of, or 
current diagnosis of a severe

severe gastroparesis, GI motility 
disorders, bowel obstruction or severe 
GI disorders or major GI surgery (e.g., 
bariatric surgery or bowel resection). 
No 
have a stable condition to accurately 
determine efficacy and safety in the 
clinical studies, and to ensure that ethical 
standards are met and to comply with the 
study protocol and procedure. 
The relevant site of action for patiromer is 
the lumen of the colon, where potassium is 
the most abundant cation due to active 
secretion and where the residence time of 
the polymer is the longest. 
This patient population was excluded in 
the clinical trials due to a potential class 
effect such as such as GI concretions, 
ischaemic colitis, GI tract ulceration or 
necrosis which could lead to intestinal 
perforations seen with other potassium 
binders and the mechanism of action of 
patiromer. 
Immunocompromised patients should not be excluded from 
receiving treatment with patiromer if the benefit outweighs the 
risk, as determined by the prescribing physician. 
The GI-related AEs have been the most common AEs reported in 
clinical studies with patiromer, but they were mild to moderate in 
nature, self-limited, did not appear to be dose related, generally 
resolved spontaneously or with treatment, and none of them were 
reported as SAEs. The common GI AEs, occurring in â¥2% of 
subjects treated with patiromer included diarrhoea and 
constipation. They are considered as expected AEs due to the 
mechanism of action of patiromer [30]. 
The SmPC provides information under Section 4.4 Special 
warnings and precautions for use: GI Disorders:  
Patients with a history of bowel obstruction or major 
gastrointestinal surgery, severe gastrointestinal disorders, or 
swallowing disorders were not included in the clinical studies. 
Gastrointestinal ischaemia, necrosis and/or intestinal perforation 
have been reported with other potassium binders. The benefits 
and risks of administering patiromer should be carefully 
evaluated in adult and paediatric patients with current or history 
of severe gastrointestinal disorders, before and during the 
treatment.

1 year of screening. 
Study specific exclusion criteria due to the 
risk for noncompliance in the use, storage, 
and handling of patiromer. 
No 
Use in patients with 
pseudo-hyperkalaemia due to 
haemolysis or to abnormally high 
numbers of platelets (>500,000/mmÂ³), 
leukocytes (>70,000/mmÂ³), or

screening based on the local 
laboratory results. 
Use in patients with heart or kidney 
transplant or anticipated need for 
transplant during study participation. 
These patients will present with inaccurate 
baseline levels of potassium. 
No 
This patient population was excluded from 
clinical trials due to their underlying 
general health condition and to be able to 
determine the most reliable assessment of 
efficacy and safety. 
No 
Use in patients with symptoms 
associated with postural hypotension. 
These patients were excluded to ensure the 
safety of the study population. 
No 
This exclusion criterion was not related to safety. These patients 
should not be excluded from receiving treatment with patiromer if 
the benefit outweighs the risk, as determined by the prescribing 
physician. 
In clinical practice, the prescribing physician has the 
responsibility in deciding the appropriate treatment to be given to 
their patient considering the patientâs underlying disease or other 
confounding factors. 
In clinical practice, the prescribing physician will need to 
determine the appropriate treatment depending on which 
condition has greater importance. 
Patients with postural hypotension could worsen but can be 
monitored on symptomatology and can be managed by 
decreasing the dose of patiromer or discontinuing treatment if 
postural hypotension persists.

Rationale 
From the clinical studies, patiromer appears to be well tolerated 
for short and long periods (up to 1 year) of treatment in subjects 
with underlying CKD, DM and/or HF, a population with a high 
burden of comorbidities and high prevalence of hyperkalaemia 
[30].

Serum magnesium <1.4 mg/dl 
(<0.58 mmol/l) at screening based on 
the local laboratory results. 
Patiromer can encounter a series of distinct 
cation environments as it traverses the GI 
tract, marked by fluctuations in proton, 
sodium, potassium, calcium and 
magnesium concentrations.  
Considered to 
be Included as 
Missing 
Information? 
No 
Rationale 
Patients with magnesium level <1.4 mg/dl (<0.58 mmol/l) were 
excluded from the clinical studies due to the possibility of further 
lowering magnesium levels. 
The SmPC provides information under Section 4.4 Special 
warnings and precaution for use:  
Low Magnesium.  
In clinical trials, serum magnesium values <1.4 mg/dl (0.58 
mmol/l) occurred in 9% of adult patients treated with patiromer. 
Mean decreases in serum magnesium were 0.17 mg/dl (0.070 
mmol/l) or less. In a clinical trial involving paediatric patients, 
mean decrease in serum magnesium at Week 26 was 0.35 mg/dl 
(0.1440 mmol/l). No patients reached serum magnesium 
<1.4 mg/dl (0.58 mmol/l) during the paediatric clinical trial.  
Serum magnesium should be monitored for at least 1 month after 
initiating treatment and as clinically indicated during treatment, 
and magnesium supplementation considered in patients who 
develop low serum magnesium levels.

No 
Rationale 
Patients with hyperkalaemia should not be excluded from getting 
treatment with patiromer, regardless of underlying comorbidities, 
if the benefit outweighs the risk as determined by their treating 
physician.  
The SmPC, Section 4.5, Interactions with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction, provides proposed 
recommendation for separating dosing of patiromer from other 
oral medicinal products by at least 3 hours. 
No 
It is recommended not to take patiromer for oral suspension at the 
same time as drugs that have been shown to bind and other oral 
medications with a narrow therapeutic window that have not been 
tested. 
From the clinical studies, patiromer appeared to be well tolerated 
for short and long periods (up to 1 year) of treatment in subjects 
with underlying CKD, T2DM and/or HF, a population with a 
high burden of comorbidities and high prevalence of 
hyperkalaemia. The effect of BMI on efficacy or safety was not 
statistically or clinically significant.

Discussion of Implications for Target 
Population 
Which are rare  To date, 2,135 adult subjects were exposed to 
patiromer within the clinical development 
programme for the proposed indication. 
Due to 
prolonged 
exposure 
Due to 
cumulative 
effects which 
have a long 
latency 
Patiromer was studied for periods of up to 
52 weeks in 2 studies: RLY5016-205 and 
PAT-CR-302. 
RLY5016-205, a 52-week Phase 2 trial, enrolled 
306 subjects (of which 304 subjects received 
patiromer) with hyperkalaemia, CKD, 
hypertension, and Type 2 diabetes who were 
receiving ACEI and/or ARB medications with or 
without spironolactone. 
The study had 2 treatment periods: a treatment 
initiation period for 8 weeks, followed by a long 
maintenance period for an additional 44 weeks, 
which allowed treatment with patiromer for up 
to a total of 1 year. 
Patiromer is non-absorbable and not 
systemically absorbed, thus limiting potential 
systemic toxicity and cumulative effects. 
Quantitative whole-body autoradiography in rats 
did not detect any radiolabel outside the GI tract. 
Distribution of the polymer is restricted to the GI 
tract; patiromer is expected to be excreted in 
faeces after approximately 24-48 hours, based 
on average GI transit time. 
The median duration of exposure in the 
patiromer safety population was 50 days overall 
(range: 1 to 796 days) [30]. 
Overall, 477/2,135 subjects (22.3%) received 
patiromer for at least 6 months, and 239/2,135 
subjects (11.2%) received patiromer for at least 
1 year. In the paediatric study, RLY5016-206p, 
all 23 subjects received patiromer for at least 
8 weeks, and 22 (96%) and 13/23 (57%) of 
subjects received patiromer for at least 3 months 
and 6 months, respectively. 
The exposure from the controlled 
randomised trials with patiromer may 
not be sufficient for capturing rare 
ADRs. 
Post-marketing surveillance will 
provide additional safety information 
on rare ADRs. 
The reported related AEs were mild to 
moderate in severity and resolved. 
The ability to detect ADRs which are 
due to prolonged exposure may have 
been affected by the duration of 
conducted clinical trials. 
Post-marketing surveillance will 
provide additional safety information 
regarding prolonged exposure. 
Data from the nonclinical and clinical 
studies showed no cumulative safety 
effects. All patients in the follow-up 
period had resolution of any TEAEs 
and did not report any recurrence 
within the end of the follow-up period. 
All related AEs resolved, even when 
patiromer was continued.  
Patiromer is non-absorbable and not 
systemically bioavailable. 
The occurrence of any safety concern 
with a long latency period is not 
expected for patiromer since it is not 
absorbed and not systemically 
available.

Not included in the clinical development programme.  
The safety of patiromer in paediatric patients is under investigation. 
A PIP has been agreed with the Paediatric Committee of the EMA.  
The benefit/risk of patiromer in this population was investigated in 
the RLY5016-206p (EMERALD) study (23 patients aged â¥6 to 
<18 years). 
The safety and efficacy of patiromer for the treatment of 
hyperkalaemia was studied in patients 6 to less than 18 years of age. 
The safety profile of Veltassa in paediatric patients was generally 
comparable to that previously observed in adult patients. Most AEs 
that were reported as related, or possibly related, to patiromer were 
GI disorders in nature, including diarrhoea. No new risks or safety 
signals were identified with the use of patiromer in any age groups 
investigated in the trial. 
Patiromer has not been studied in paediatric patients below 6 years of 
age. 
From 2,135 subjects treated with patiromer in pooled clinical studies, 
61% were age 65 years and over, and 23% were age 75 years and 
over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between 
these subjects and younger subjects, but subjects aged 65 years and 
older reported more GI and cardiovascular events than younger 
subjects [30]. However, interpretation of associations with age are 
confounded by potential differences in co-existing comorbidities or 
severity of comorbidities that are associated with older age in the 
population. No special dose and administration guidelines were 
applied to seniors in these studies. 
Patients with Relevant Comorbidities: 
â¢  Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment 
Not included in the clinical development programme.  
The monitoring of the hepatic enzymes was performed on all subjects 
in clinical trials regardless of their underlying comorbidities. 
Patiromer is not systemically bioavailable, which is supported by the 
rat and dog repeat-dose toxicity studies which showed no organ 
toxicity. 
â¢  Patients with renal impairment  Hyperkalaemic patients often have CKD as a comorbidity. 
Of the 2,135 subjects in the pooled safety population, 64% had CKD 
at baseline, with a mean (SD) time since diagnosis of 3.9 (4.87) 
years. The most frequent CKD stages at baseline were CKD Stage 3b 
(36.0%), CKD Stage 3a (23.8%), and CKD Stage 4 (22.2%). No 
special dosing adjustments were needed for subjects with renal 
impairment.

Exposure 
A substantial proportion of the 2,135 subjects in the pooled safety 
population had cardiovascular disease at baseline, including 74% of 
subjects with HF and 36% of subjects with a history of MI. 
Furthermore, CKD, which increases risk for cardiovascular disease, 
cardiovascular death, and sudden cardiac death, was present at 
baseline in approximately 64% of subjects in the pooled safety 
population. Cardiovascular events were thus events of special interest 
in the clinical studies of patiromer, which were conducted primarily 
in subjects with significant cardiovascular comorbidities or risk 
factors [30]. 
Cardiac SAEs included cardiac failure (20/2,135 subjects, 0.9%), 
acute MI, cardiac failure acute, atrial fibrillation, and MI (0.2% 
each), angina unstable, ventricular tachycardia, acute left ventricular 
failure, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac failure chronic, coronary 
artery disease, and cardiorespiratory arrest (0.1% each). None of the 
cardiac-related SAEs were evaluated by the Investigator as related to 
patiromer. 
No cardiac AEs occurred in â¥2% of subjects treated with patiromer. 
The most common cardiac TEAEs, occurring in >0.5% of subjects, 
was cardiac failure (1.7% of subjects), atrial fibrillation (0.9% of 
subjects), and ventricular and supraventricular extrasystoles (0.7% of 
subjects, each).

POST-AUTHORISATION EXPERIENCE 
SV 
Veltassa  was  first  authorised  for  marketing  on  21 October  2015  in  the  US,  where  the 
product was launched in December 2015. The international birth date is commonly defined 
in  the  International  Council  for  Harmonisation  of  Technical  Requirements  for 
Pharmaceuticals  for  Human  Use  E2C(R2)  Periodic  Benefit-Risk  Evaluation  Report 
Guideline as the date of the first  marketing authorisation  for the product  granted to  any 
company in any country in the world. For Veltassa, the international birth date is therefore 
defined as 21 October 2015. 
On  19  July  2017,  Veltassa  has  received  marketing  authorisation  through  the  centralised 
procedure  in  the  EU/EEA.  To  date,  Veltassa  is  approved  in  39  countries:  EU/EEA 
(30 countries),  US,  Switzerland,  UK,  Australia,  Canada,  Israel,  United  Arab  Emirates, 
Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait for the treatment of hyperkalaemia. 
Post-authorisation Exposure 
Method Used to Calculate Exposure 
SV.1 
SV.1.1 
The exact number of patients exposed to Veltassa is not available. Assumptions considered 
to calculate patient exposure included obtaining the number of Veltassa boxes dispensed 
per  month  to  patients  in  the  1  g,  8.4  g,  16.8  g  and  25.2  g  sachets.  The  number  of 
patient-years  has  been  calculated  from  the  total  amount  of  Veltassa  powder  for  oral 
suspension (30 sachets in 1 carton) sold, assuming that a âstandard patientâ takes an average 
number of 1 sachet per day.

SVI.1 
No  potential  or  low  potential,  as  it  does  not  have  systemic  effects  besides  lowering 
potassium; narrow pharmacodynamic effects minimise the risk for illegal purposes.

Blood magnesium decreased: 11 (0.5%) lower limit (0.3%) upper limit (0.9%) 
Blood magnesium abnormal: Not reported 
38 (1.8%) patients experienced an event of hypomagnesaemia, and 9 (0.4%) 
patients experienced an event of blood magnesium decreased, assessed as 
related to patiromer. 
No SAEs of hypomagnesaemia, blood magnesium decreased, and blood 
magnesium abnormal were reported.  
The majority of the reported hypomagnesaemia events resolved. 
No subjects in the pooled studies were permanently discontinued study drug or 
were considered as serious because of hypomagnesaemia or blood magnesium 
decreased.  
Hypomagnesaemia was a common ADR seen in the clinical studies (1.8%). 
Subjects experienced a serum magnesium value of <1.4 mg/dl (7.1%), 
<1.2 mg/dl (1.8%), and <1.0 mg/dl (0.3%) at any time point in the clinical 
studies. 
No deaths or CV adverse events were attributable to low magnesium.  
The incidence of hypomagnesaemia in the general population has been 
estimated at less than 2%. Some studies have estimated that 75% of Americans 
do not meet the recommended dietary allowance of magnesium [31]. 
In a Mayo Clinic review, magnesium levels of less than 1.7 mg/dl were noted in 
13,320 of 65,974 hospitalised adult patients (20.2%). Hypomagnesaemia was 
common in patients with haematologic/oncological disorders [32]. 
The risk of hypomagnesaemia can be summarised as follows: 
â¢ 
â¢ 
â¢ 
â¢ 
â¢ 
2% in the general population 
10-20% in hospitalised patients 
50-60% in intensive care unit patients 
30-80% in persons with alcoholism 
25% in outpatients with diabetes 
The major risk factors for hypomagnesaemia in the population studied include a 
predominantly elderly population, CKD (Stage 2-4), diabetes, HF, 
hypertension, and prior myocardial infarction.  
The principal site of magnesium absorption is the proximal small intestine, with 
limited absorption in the ileum and colon. No extra-renal secretion mechanisms 
for magnesium excretion exist in the colon, thus RLY5016 powder for oral 
suspension binding in the colon is unlikely to significantly affect magnesium 
balance. Since the majority of magnesium uptake occurs in the small intestine, 
any remaining magnesium binding by RLY5016 powder for oral suspension in 
the colon would likely be minor.

The applicant proposes to include in the SmPC under Section 4.4 Special 
warning and precautions for use:  
Low Magnesium 
In clinical trials, serum magnesium values <1.4 mg/dl (0.58 mmol/l) occurred in 
9% of adult patients treated with patiromer. Mean decreases in serum 
magnesium were 0.17 mg/dl (0.070 mmol/l) or less. In a clinical trial involving 
paediatric patients, mean decrease in serum magnesium at Week 26 was 
0.35 mg/dl (0.1440 mmol/l). No patients reached serum magnesium <1.4 mg/dl 
(0.58 mmol/l) during the paediatric clinical trial.  
Serum magnesium should be monitored for at least 1 month after initiating 
treatment and as clinically indicated during treatment, and magnesium 
supplementation considered in patients who develop low serum magnesium 
levels. 
All of the reported hypomagnesaemia events were mild to moderate, 
asymptomatic, and resolved in the majority of the cases.  
Unlikely to put patient at immediate risk, if magnesium levels are monitored in 
conjunction with potassium levels. Low magnesium level is easily reversible 
with magnesium supplements or fluids which contain electrolytes. Clinical 
symptoms of hypomagnesaemia, including neurologic and cardiac sequelae are 
generally not observed until serum magnesium levels are <1.0 mg/dl. 
There is no anticipated potential public health impact of this safety concern.

Evidence source and 
strength of evidence 
Hypercalcaemia is a disorder that most commonly results from malignancy or 
primary hyperparathyroidism. The incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism 
alone is approximately 1-2 cases per 1,000 adults. Mild cases are often not 
diagnosed. A review of cancer-related hypercalcaemia found that rates varied by 
tumour type, being highest in multiple myeloma (7.5â10.2%) and lowest in 
prostate cancer (1.4â2.1%). Prevalence rates in large Scandinavian groups: as 
high as 39 cases per 1,000 persons. South Africa: 8 cases per 1,000 persons 
[33-36]. Hypercalcaemic crisis is a severe elevation of serum calcium, is usually 
considered as a value more than 14 mg/dl. Other, less common causes of 
elevated calcium include increased intake or absorption, granulomatous disease, 
immobilisation, thiazide diuretic use and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia. 
In addition, a new trend in the diagnosis of CSS is based on the presence of 
hypercalcaemia with a normal parathyroid hormone level. The use of Vitamin D 
with calcium supplementation is known to contribute to the risk of 
hypercalcaemia in patients with CKD [37]. 
Factors that increase the risk of hypercalcaemia: Malignancy, primary 
hyperthyroidism, calcium and Vitamin D supplements, antacids, granulomatous 
disease, immobilisation, thiazide diuretics, lithium, hyperthyroidism, and CKD 
especially advanced stage (end-stage renal disease).  
Risk groups: Scandinavian and South Africans. 
Veltassa is a non-absorbed, cation exchange polymer that contains a 
calcium-sorbitol complex as a counterion. Veltassa increases faecal potassium 
excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the GI tract. Binding of 
potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the GI lumen, resulting 
in a reduction of serum potassium levels.  
During cation exchange, a portion of the calcium in patiromer is released in the 
GI tract, some of which may be absorbed. Some of the released calcium is 
bound by luminal constituents (i.e., phosphate, oxalate) and becomes 
unavailable for absorption. These factors limit the risk of developing 
hypercalcaemia. 
The applicant proposes to include in the SmPC under Section 4.4 Special 
warnings and precautions for use:  
Information about calcium:  
Veltassa contains calcium as part of the counterion complex. Calcium is 
partially released some of which may be absorbed. The benefits and risks of 
administering this medicinal product should be carefully evaluated in adult and 
paediatric patients at risk of hypercalcaemia. Serum calcium should be 
monitored for at least 1 month after initiating treatment and as clinically 
indicated during treatment. 
There were 6 reported hypercalcaemia cases (mild) in patiromer in the clinical 
studies (pooled safety population). Total frequency of 0.05 per 100 patients 
(111,744 patient-years), case reports seen in post-marketing experience were 
mostly non-serious. Cases seen in post-marketing were also mild 
hypercalcaemia with some cases showing an unrelated causality.  
Unlikely to put patient at immediate risk, and the condition can be easily 
managed and reversible. 
There is no anticipated potential public health impact of this safety concern.

Potential mechanisms 
The majority of the GI AEs were mild to moderate in nature. GI AEs were 
severe in 0.5%. The potential for these mild to moderate GI AEs to aggravate a 
pre-existing condition such as haemorrhoids cannot be excluded and was not 
seen in the clinical studies.

inpatient procedures (2007)  
Ambulatory surgical procedures: 20.4 millionâ20 percent of all âwrite-inâ

Factors that increase the risk of death: Advanced age, presence of pre-existing 
underlying disease, malnutrition, the nature of the underlying or primary cause, 
and the appearance of complications [38].  
Veltassa is a non-absorbed, cation exchange polymer that contains a 
calcium-sorbitol complex as a counterion.

The applicant proposes to include in the SmPC under Section 4.4 Special 
warnings and precautions for use:  
Gastrointestinal Disorders 
Patients with a history of bowel obstruction or major gastrointestinal surgery, 
severe gastrointestinal disorders, or swallowing disorders were not included in 
the clinical studies. Gastrointestinal ischaemia, necrosis and/or intestinal 
perforation have been reported with other potassium binders. The benefits and 
risks of administering patiromer should be carefully evaluated in adult and 
paediatric patients with current or history of severe gastrointestinal disorders, 
before and during the treatment. 
All of the reported GI-related disorders were mild to moderate, self-limited and 
not dose dependent.  
Unlikely to put patient at immediate risk, if mild to moderate GI disorders are 
proactively managed to prevent the aggravation of a pre-existing condition. 
GI-related disorders are reversible with discontinuation of medication and/or 
treatment with laxatives.  
There is no anticipated potential public health impact of this safety concern.

Missing Information 
Missing Information  What Is Known  
Pregnancy or lactating women 
Evidence source: 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information  
Pregnancy: There are no data from the use of Veltassa in pregnant women.  
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity (see Section 5.3).  
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Veltassa during 
pregnancy.  
Breastfeeding: No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since 
the systemic exposure of the breastfeeding woman to patiromer is negligible. A 
decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to 
discontinue/abstain from patiromer therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning 
to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this 
medicine.  
Use Veltassa during pregnancy only if your doctor considers it necessary.

PART V:  RISK MINIMISATION MEASURES (INCLUDING 
EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK 
MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES) 
V.1  Routine Risk Minimisation Measures 
The proposed routine risk minimisation measures are listed below. The effectiveness of the 
routine risk minimisation measures (such as SmPC, Patient Information Leaflet, pack size, 
legal status) will be regularly evaluated and assessed based on all received Individual Case 
Safety Reports from various sources following the pharmacovigilance processes in place. 
The  outcome  of  these  assessments  will  be  summarised  and  discussed  in  the  PSUR 
(including discussions about off-label use and medication errors) and will be reflected in 
the update of labelling documents and revisions of the RMP, as required and triggered by 
the  signal  detection  and  management,  definition  of  new  safety  concerns  and  review  of 
already identified and potential risks as well as missing information. 
Currently, there are no additional risk minimisation measures in place or deemed necessary.

PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN  
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Veltassa (Patiromer) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan for Veltassa. The Risk Management Plan 
details  important  risks  of  Veltassa,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more 
information will be obtained about Veltassa's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Veltassa's  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  its  Package  Leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Veltassa should be used.  
This summary of the Risk Management Plan for Veltassa should be read in the context of 
all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report.  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Veltassa's Risk Management Plan. 
The Medicine and What It Is Used for 
I. 
Veltassa is authorised for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in adults and adolescents aged 12 
to  17 years  (see Summary of Product  Characteristics for the full indication).  It  contains 
patiromer sorbitex calcium as the active substance and it is given orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of Veltassaâs benefits can be found in Veltassaâs 
European Public Assessment Report, including in its plain-language summary, available 
on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicineâs  webpage  (https://www.ema.europa.eu/ 
en/medicines/human/EPAR/veltassa).  
II.  Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Veltassa, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Veltassa risks, are outlined below.  
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
â¢  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
Package  Leaflet  and  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  addressed  to  patients  and 
healthcare professionals. 
â¢ 
Important advice on the medicineâs packaging. 
â¢  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly. 
â¢  The medicineâs legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
 
 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and  regularly  analysed,  including  Periodic  Safety  Update  Reports  assessment  so  that 
immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Veltassa is not yet available, it is 
listed under âmissing informationâ below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Veltassa are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Veltassa. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, 
but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

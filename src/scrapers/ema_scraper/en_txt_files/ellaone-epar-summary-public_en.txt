EPAR summary for the public 
ellaOne 
ulipristal acetate 
This document is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for ellaOne. It explains 
how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the medicine to reach its 
opinion in favour of granting a marketing authorisation and its recommendations on the conditions of 
use for ellaOne. 
What is ellaOne? 
EllaOne is a medicine that contains the active substance ulipristal acetate. It is available as tablets 
(30 mg). 
What is ellaOne used for? 
EllaOne is a female emergency contraceptive to be taken within 120 hours (five days) of unprotected 
sex or contraceptive failure (such as a tear in a condom during sex). 
The medicine can be obtained without a prescription. 
How is ellaOne used? 
EllaOne is taken as one tablet by mouth as soon as possible, but no later than 120 hours, after 
unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. If the woman vomits within three hours of taking the 
medicine she should take another tablet. EllaOne can be taken at any time during the menstrual cycle. 
If a woman’s menstrual period is late or in case of symptoms of pregnancy, pregnancy should be 
excluded before ellaOne is taken.

How does ellaOne work? 
For pregnancy to occur there has to be ovulation (release of eggs) followed by the fertilisation of the 
egg (fusion with a sperm) and implantation in the womb. The sex hormone progesterone plays a role 
in the timing of ovulation and in preparing the lining of womb to receive the fertilised egg. 
The active substance in ellaOne, ulipristal acetate, acts as a progesterone receptor modulator. This 
means that it attaches to the receptors that progesterone normally attaches to, preventing the 
hormone from having its effect. Through its actions on the progesterone receptors, ellaOne prevents 
pregnancies mainly by preventing or delaying ovulation. If ovulation has already occurred, ellaOne is 
no longer effective. 
How has ellaOne been studied? 
In one main study, ellaOne was given to 1,533 women (aged on average 24 years) who had requested 
emergency contraception between two and five days after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. 
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of women who did not become pregnant. This 
number was then compared with the number of women who would have been expected to become 
pregnant if they had not taken a contraceptive. This number was calculated from published pregnancy 
rates. 
An additional study compared ellaOne with levonorgestrel (another medicine used in emergency 
contraception). This study included women who took the medicine within two days of unprotected sex 
or contraceptive failure. 
What benefit has ellaOne shown during the studies? 
EllaOne was effective as an emergency contraceptive, reducing the number of unintended pregnancies. 
Of the women who completed the main study, 2.1% (26 out of 1,241) became pregnant. This is less 
than the 5.5% of women who would have been expected to become pregnant if they had not taken 
any contraceptive. EllaOne therefore prevented about three-fifths of the pregnancies. 
The additional study, which included women who took the medicine within two days of unprotected sex 
or contraceptive failure, supported the effectiveness of ellaOne. In this study, ellaOne was as effective 
as levonorgestrel at preventing pregnancies. 
What is the risk associated with ellaOne? 
The most common side effects with ellaOne are headache, nausea (feeling sick), abdominal pain 
(stomach ache) and dysmenorrhea (period pains). For the full list of all side effects and restrictions, 
see the package leaflet. 
Why has ellaOne been approved? 
The CHMP decided that ellaOne’s benefits are greater than its risks and recommended that it be given 
marketing authorisation.

What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
ellaOne? 
A risk management plan has been developed to ensure that ellaOne is used as safely as possible. 
Based on this plan, safety information has been included in the summary of product characteristics and 
the package leaflet for ellaOne, including the appropriate precautions to be followed by healthcare 
professionals and patients.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are among the most common infections seen 
in clinical practice; these infections may require systemic antibacterial therapy, surgical management and 
hospitalisation. Untreated infections may become severe or life-threatening, depending on the pathogen 
[Corey and Stryjewski, 2011; Elston, 2005]. ABSSSIs include cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infections, 
major cutaneous abscesses, and burn infections. They commonly involve at least a 75 cm2 surface area 
of redness, oedema and/or induration accompanied by lymph node enlargement or systemic symptoms 
such as fever [FDA, 2010].  
The morbidity associated with ABSSSI often requires rapid intervention with antibacterial therapy to 
minimise tissue damage and prevent the spread of infection. The clinical complications of delayed or 
inappropriate treatment of skin and skin structure infections can be serious, including those resulting 
from local spread, secondary bacteraemia with potential for distant metastatic foci of infection, and 
systemic effects [Davis et al., 2007]. In a study of 47,219 patients hospitalised for ABSSSI treatment 
failure occurred in 22.8% of patients and was associated with a 3-fold increase in mortality (OR, 2.91 
[95% CI, 2.34‐3.62]) [Edelsberg et al., 2008]. Treatment failure also increased the duration of both IV 
therapy and hospital stay by 5 to 6 days. Hence, patients hospitalised with ABSSSI who experience failure 
of initial therapy have significantly worse clinical outcomes and longer stays. 
The most common pathogen is S. aureus. The SENTRY programme demonstrated that S. aureus was the 
most prevalent cause of nosocomial and community-acquired skin and skin structure infections and 
bloodstream infections in almost all geographic regions [Moet et al., 2007; Moellering et al., 2010]. S. 
aureus has developed resistance to all classes of antibacterial agents available for clinical use [Federal 
Register, 2013]. Numerous resistance mechanisms have been documented in S. aureus, including the 
transmission of resistance that can occur via plasmids shared between bacteria, or even transfer of 
resistance mechanisms from different genera of bacteria [Pantosti et al., 2007]. 
Patients infected with drug-resistant pathogens are more challenging to treat than those infected with 
drug-susceptible pathogens. For example, a patient infected with a drug-resistant pathogen may have a 
delay in the initiation of effective drug therapy that can result in poor outcomes [Federal Register, 2013]. 
Additionally, patients and healthcare providers face challenges with the treatments available for ABSSSIs, 
specifically for the treatment of MRSA. The spectrum of activity and toxicity profiles of available agents 
indicated for the treatment of ABSSSI contribute to the treatment difficulties [Bishop, 2006].   
Current treatments approved for the treatment of ABSSSI include daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, 
ceftaroline and vancomycin. Vancomycin continues to be widely used to cover MRSA. These therapies 
consist of multi-dose and multi-day regimens with some requiring dosage adjustments for renal 
Assessment report

insufficiency (vancomycin), therapeutic monitoring (vancomycin), precautionary use in pregnant women 
(tigecycline) and myelosuppression (linezolid). Multi-dose therapies may require patients to be 
hospitalised throughout treatment and could lead to an increased risk of acquiring and spreading 
infections in the hospital. Treatment non-adherence can also be an issue with these regimens, increasing 
the potential for pathogen resistance [CDC, 2011]. Additionally, there is a limited armamentarium to treat 
resistant pathogens such as MRSA that pose an increasingly serious threat to public health. 
There is a need for new antibacterial agents that will effectively treat infections caused by Gram-positive 
bacteria including highly resistant and virulent pathogens such as MRSA. According to the ECDC, the 
number of patients in Europe that are infected by resistant bacteria is increasing and resistance is a major 
threat to public health owing to mounting healthcare costs, failed treatments and deaths [ECDC, 2012]. 
MRSA remains a public health priority because of the substantial resistance burden in Southern and 
Eastern Europe [ECDC, 2012]. 
About the product 
Oritavancin is a semi-synthetic, lipoglycopeptide the following mechanism of action: 
1)  
2)  
3)  
Inhibition of the transglycosylation (polymerisation) step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to 
the stem peptide of peptidoglycan precursors 
Inhibition of the transpeptidation (crosslinking) step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the 
peptide bridging segments of the cell wall 
Disruption of bacterial membrane integrity, leading to depolarisation, increased permeability and 
rapid cell death.  
Oritavancin is a large molecule with a structure that resembles that of vancomycin. It is soluble in water 
and in acidic solutions. A solution of oritavancin in water has pH 2.8. It is presented for clinical use as the 
lyophilisate  of  the  dihydrogen  phosphate  salt.  The  vials  proposed  for  commercial  use  contain  the 
equivalent  of  400  mg  of  the  free  base.  The  1200  mg  single  dose  is  administered  by  transferring  the 
contents of three reconstituted vials into a 1000 ml bag of 5% D5W (from which the total reconstitution 
volume (120 ml) has been withdrawn. The resulting 1.2 mg/ml solution of oritavancin is infused over 3 h. 
The revised section 4.1 is as follows: 
Orbactiv is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in 
adults (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
The revised section 4.2 reads as follows: 
Posology 
1,200 mg administered as a single dose by intravenous infusion over 3 hours. 
Special populations 
Elderly  (≥ 65 years) 
No dosage adjustment is required for patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2).  
Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in patients with severe renal impairment has not been evaluated.   
Oritavancin is not removed from blood by haemodialysis procedures. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Class B) (see section 5.2). The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) has not been evaluated.

reconstituted with water for injections and the resulting concentrate must be diluted in glucose 5% 
intravenous infusion bag prior to use. After reconstitution, 1 ml of the solution contains 10 mg 
oritavancin. After dilution, 1 ml of the solution for infusion contains 1.2 mg oritavancin. 
Other ingredients are: mannitol and phosphoric acid. 
The product is available in single-use 50 ml Type 1 glass vials with rubber stoppers and aluminium flip off 
cap. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance oritavancin diphosphate is a semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide antibiotic. The 
chemical name of oritavancin diphosphate is [4”R]-22-O-(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-3-C-methyl- α 
-Larabino- hexopyranosyl)-N3’’-[(4’-chloro[1,1’-biphenyl]-4-yl)methyl] vancomycin phosphate [1:2] 
[salt] and it has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 11/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The heptapeptide core has the same structure as Vancomycin. The amino sugars are different but 
epimeric to the vancosamine contained in Vancomycin. 
The structure of oritavancin diphosphate has been confirmed by elemental analysis, mass spectroscopy, 
1H and 13C-NMR, IR, UV and X-ray Powder Diffraction. 
Oritavancin diphosphate is a hygroscopic white to pale pink solid that is soluble in water (60.75 mg/ml) 
and 5 % Dextrose (≥33.3 to < 100 mg/ml); however, the solubility is affected by pH and buffer species 
used. The solubility decreases considerably towards neutral/basic pH. Oritavancin has poor crystallinity; 
oritavancin cannot be obtained in crystalline form. Therefore polymorphism has not been observed for 
oritavancin diphosphate. The crystallinity of the drug substance is not critical to the bioavailability of the 
drug product since the product is administered as an intravenous infusion following reconstitution and 
dilution of the lyophilized dosage form. 
Oritavancin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 22 asymmetric carbons and three additional 
chiral elements associated with the restricted rotation of the biphenyl moiety and the 2 diphenyl ether 
moieties. The stereogenic centers in oritavancin diphosphate are the same as those in Nucleus Factor B 
(intermediate produced during fermentation to form oritavancin). Both of these compounds share the 
same chiral elements as vancomycin with the exception of the additional 4-epivancosamine. There are no 
additional stereogenic centers introduced as a result of the reductive alkylation step that follow the 
fermentation process. As a fermentation product, Nucleus factor B is synthesised with a high level of 
stereocontrol by biological processes. The potential for racemisation of any of the chiral elements under 
the conditions of fermentation, isolation and chemistry used in the manufacturing of oritavancin is 
extremely low. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Oritavancin diphosphate is manufactured in two steps by one manufacturer using well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. The first step involves classical fermentation using 
Kibdelosporangium aridum (formerly referred to as Amycolatopsis orientalis) culture to produce the 
intermediate Nucleus Factor B. The second step is a synthetic step that consists of reductive alkylation of 
Nucleus Factor B to produce Oritavancin. The crude active substance is purified by column 
chromatography and ultrafiltration to yield oritavancin which is then converted to the diphosphate salt. 
Satisfactory details of phenotypic and genotypic characterisation of Kibdelosporangium aridum Cell Bank 
are provided. 
The applicant has confirmed that the fermentation medium for the commercial process does not contain 
any animal source material (ASM). However, animal source material was present in the fermentation 
media used for the production of batches used in the early clinical studies. Comparative data for batches 
produced with ASM containing fermentation medium and ASM-free fermentation medium confirm that 
there were no changes in the characteristics of oritavancin. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, solution colour and clarity (Ph. Eur.), 
identity (FTIR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), phosphate (IC), impurities (HPLC, GC), residual solvents (GC), 
water content (KF), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), Boron and Copper (ICP), 
Cyanide (IC), microbial contamination (Ph. Eur) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to the “Guideline on setting 
specifications for related impurities in antibiotics” (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/199250/2009 corr) were 
qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data of the active substance (including 4 batches manufactured at the proposed 
commercial manufacturing site according to the proposed commercial process) were provided. The 
results were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 8 commercial batches of active substance (including 4 batches manufactured without 
animal sourced material)  from the proposed manufacturer  stored for 36-48 months under long term 
conditions at 5 ºC and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. 
The parameters tested were the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. 
Oritavancin was exposed to stress conditions as part of the forced degradation specificity study during 
method validation. The stress conditions used were: Heat (solid) 24 hours, 105 °C; Heat (solution) 
Reflux, water, 5 hours; UV Light (solid) 24 hours, ambient; Acid (solution) 1 N aqueous H2SO4, 30 hours, 
ambient; Base (solution) 0.5 N aqueous NaOH, 4 hours, ambient; Oxidative (solution) 30% aqueous 
H2O2, 43 hours, ambient. The results showed varying degree of degradation under the different 
conditions and confirmed the analytical methods are stability indicating. 
 The stability results indicated that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a sterile intravenous formulation in single-use 
vials. The base form of Oritavancin is insufficiently soluble in water. A screening process was undertaken 
to identify a salt with improved solubility. The diphosphate salt form showed the best solubility and an 
acceptable pH, therefore it was selected for further development. Due to lack of stability of the 
Oritavancin solution it was developed as a lyophilized dosage form which requires reconstitution with 
Sterile Water for Injection and further dilution prior to administration. To provide an acceptable firm 
homogenous cake structure and also improve stability of the formulation, three bulking/stabilising agents 
were evaluated during formulation development (mannitol, sucrose, and trehalose). Mannitol was chosen 
as the bulking/stabilising agent for its physical properties. However, mannitol has a tendency to 
crystallise, leading to active substance -mannitol phase separation that leaves the active substance 
unprotected. Therefore, to minimise crystallisation, the ratio of mannitol to active substance was 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 13/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
evaluated. The best ratio of mannitol to drug was found to be 1:2.  In addition, phosphoric acid is used 
during formulation to achieve the desired solution pH (3.6 to 3.8) prior to lyophilisation. 
The pharmaceutical development was initiated by a different company for a 100 mg formulation. The 
100 mg drug product process was then transferred to two manufacturing sites with minimal changes. The 
400 mg drug product formulation, which is the proposed commercial dosage form, was developed later. 
The same general manufacturing process is used for both drug product strengths. Differences in 
manufacturing between the two presentations are bulk solution concentration, lyophilisation time, 
primary drying temperature and batch size. The manufacturing process was later transferred to the 
proposed manufacturing site with a minor change. 
Three different formulations of Oritavancin for Injection have been used in clinical studies and were 
presented. To support a 1200 mg dose, a formulation containing 400 mg Oritavancin was developed for 
some of the Phase 3 studies. The differences of the phase 3 and the product for commercial use have been 
presented and adequately justified 
The required  administered dose is 1200 mg which is achieved by using three single vials of the 400 mg 
formulation.  Combining three vials bears a risk of microbial contamination during handling. 
Therefore a 1200 mg formulation would be more appropriate. However it has been shown that due to the 
physicochemical properties of the active substance a 1200 mg formulation has not been possible so far. 
The CHMP considered that the proposed 400 mg formulation can be acceptable and acknowledged the 
applicant’s commitment to explore ways to improve handling or reformulating Orbactiv by developing a 
1200mg vial presentation as part of lifecycle management. In addition appropriate handling  instructions 
were included in section 6.6 of the SmPC to address the risk of contamination during handling. 
All excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Oritavancin for Injection is prepared by dissolving mannitol and oritavancin diphosphate in water for 
injection (WFI) which is adjusted to a pH of 3.6-3.8 with dilute phosphoric acid solution. The bulk solution 
is sterile filtered through 0.22 µm polyvinylidene (PVDF) membrane filters and aseptically filled into 
sterile vials under sterile nitrogen and lyophilised.  
During manufacturing process development, the effect on the stability of the bulk solution of heat and 
light during manufacture were investigated. The water pH range was determined so that the formulated 
bulk solution provides acceptable solubility of oritavancin and stability of the lyophilised product. 
The order of addition of mannitol and oritavancin diphosphate was found not to affect the solution 
preparation. Data were provided to support the hold period for bulk solution before sterile filtration and 
were considered acceptable. Studies for evaluation of extractable substances from the filters were 
performed. The lyophilisation cycle was developed for the 100 mg strength. The factors affecting that 
crystallinity of mannitol in the lyophilisate were studied in a number of experiments including a factorial 
design. It was found that adjusting the lyophilisation parameters was sufficient to control the crystallinity 
of the mannitol in the lyophilisate.  
There is no overage for Oritavancin for Injection. However, a 1.25 % overfill (405 mg) is added for vial 
retention to ensure labelled content (400 mg) can be withdrawn.  
Oritavancin was found to be compatible with Dextrose 5% injection (D5W) but not with 0.9% sodium 
chloride injection (Normal Saline).

The osmolality of oritavancin reconstituted and admixed with Dextrose 5% injection (D5W) was found to 
be similar to an isotonic solution of D5W  and serum. 
Stability of reconstituted solution was investigated. The following precaution was required to be included 
in the SmPC “The reconstituted solution should be further diluted in glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) intravenous 
infusion bag immediately.” 
The chemical stability of reconstituted Oritavancin 400 mg drug product diluted in D5W solutions in PVC 
bags and PP bags was investigated. A significant assay decrease was observed in the PP bags after 48 
hours. Results demonstrated an acceptable chemical stability of 24 hours at room temperature and 2-8 °C 
in both PVC and PP bags. 
Microbial stability of oritavancin in D5W admixture solution was investigated. The applicant initially 
claimed in-use stability of 48 hours for the diluted drug product in D5W. This was not considered 
acceptable by CHMP since the drug product does not prevent the growth of at least one microorganism 
frequently associated with nosocomial infections (Serratia marcescens) in the claimed time.  
The following precaution was included in the SmPC “The diluted solution should be used immediately. 
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately 
storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be 
longer than 12 hours at 25°C and 24 hours at 2-8°C for Orbactiv diluted in glucose 5% intravenous 
infusion bag, unless reconstitution and dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic 
conditions.” 
The primary packaging is a single-use 50 ml Type 1 glass vials with a rubber stopper and an aluminium 
flip off cap. The material complies with Ph.Eur. requirements. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 5 main steps: preparation of oritavancin bulk solution, 
pre-filtration, aseptic filtration and filling, lyophilisation and stoppering, packaging. The process is 
considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on three 
commercial scale batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form:

(Ph.Eur.), Clarity of Solution (Ph. Eur.), Identity  (HPLC, UV), Assay (HPLC), Uniformity of dosage 
(Ph.Eur.), Impurities  (HPLC), Water content (Karl Fischer), Ethanol  (GC), pH (Ph.Eur.), Particulate 
Matter (Ph.Eur.), Bacterial Endotoxins (Ph.Eur.) and Sterility (Ph.Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing.  
The in-house analytical procedures are described and validated. The method for assay as well as related 
substances was shown to be stability indicating through forced degradation studies.

Batch analysis results are provided for 3 batches (including 1 commercial batch) confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. Additional batch analysis data were provided for 100 mg strength and for the 400mg 
strength manufactured at different sites. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 batches  of finished product (including 1 production scale batch) stored for  up to 24 
months under long term conditions   at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are 
representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
Additional supportive stability data are also provided for 100 mg strength batches and for 400 mg 
strength batches manufactured at other manufacturing sites.  
Samples were tested according to the shelf-life specifications (identical to the release specifications 
except for assay, impurities and water content were shelf-life limits are different from release limits and 
except for the uniformity of dosage test only performed at release). The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The drug product was shown stable in the clear glass vial without 
label and is considered not light-sensitive and no special packaging protection from light was considered 
needed. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
The applicant has proposed that no animal source material will be used for the fermentation step of the 
manufacturing process of the active substance for commercial batches. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The required dose is 1200 mg and is administered by using three vials of 400 mg. In this regard 
appropriate handling instructions were included in section 6.6 of the SmPC to address the risk of 
contamination during handling. The CHMP considered the handling instructions sufficient and the 
proposed 400 mg formulation acceptable, and acknowledged the applicant’s commitment to develop a 
formulation of 1200mg.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- explore ways to improve handling or reformulating Orbactiv by developing a 1200mg vial presentation 
as part of lifecycle management 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GLP 
In general, the safety pharmacology and pivotal toxicology and toxicokinetic studies were performed in 
accordance with GLP regulations and were consistent with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) standards in effect at that time. No issues for GLP compliance have been raised. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
See the clinical Pharmacodynamics section regarding antibacterial activity. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In receptor binding assays, oritavancin competed with radioligand binding to dopaminergic D1 and D2 
receptors in rat brain homogenates with affinity constants (Ki) of 2.25 μM and 3.46 μM, respectively. 
Oritavancin (1 μM) exhibited a slight inhibition on the force of acetylcholine-induced contractions of 
guinea pig ileum tissue. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In mice administered a single intravenous (IV) dose of 5, 15 or 50 mg/kg, there were no notable changes 
in observable behaviour, spontaneous ambulatory or non-ambulatory activity counts, convulsive activity 
induced by electroshock or pentylenetetrazol, neuromuscular function, or sensorimotor reactivity. Acetic 
acid-induced writhing was used to evaluate the analgesic potential of oritavancin. There were no 
statistically significant alterations in acetic acid-induced writhing at any dose level, although reduced 
writhing was noted in the 50 mg/kg dose group. The 50 mg/kg group also showed a transient reduction 
of 1.1ºC in body temperature.  
Oritavancin increased hexobarbital-induced sleep times in mice dosed 50 mg/kg indicating that 
oritavancin may produce central nervous system (CNS) depression or inhibit hepatic enzymes involved in 
hexobarbital metabolism. The applicant states that the latter explanation is more likely because it is 
supported by the observation that oritavancin inhibited several CYP450 enzymes including those involved 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 17/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the metabolism of hexobarbital (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4) in human hepatic 
microsomes. 
In-vitro studies indicated oritavancin has the potential to interact with several cardiac ion channels. In 
HEK293 cells stably transfected with hERG complementary DNA, oritavancin reduced delayed rectifier 
potassium current (IKr) tail current amplitudes with a low potency (IC50 = 22 μM). In assays conducted 
with human atrial myocytes oritavancin inhibited the cardiac sodium current (Ina) and transient outward 
potassium current (Ito) ion channels with IC50s of 0.51 μM and 4.2 μM, respectively. There was no effect 
of oritavancin on sustained current (Isus) or inwardly rectifying potassium current (Ik1). The translation 
of single ion channel inhibitory activity is complex and can be influenced by many factors, including the 
kinetics of channel block, additional pharmacological properties (both known and unknown), and the 
potential for regional effects on the heart. The applicant proposes to include cardiac conduction events in 
the Risk Management Plan and should suggest a reasonable approach for routine pharmacovigilance 
monitoring. 
Rats administered 50 mg/kg oritavancin exhibited increased systolic pressure (range 15–22 mmHg), 
mean arterial pressure (range 13 – 15 mmHg), and aortic pulse pressure (10 mmHg). No cardiovascular 
effects were observed in rats administered up to 15 mg/kg. Dogs administered IV doses of 25 mg/kg dose 
groups exhibited increases in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures and reduced arterial 
pulse pressure. The left ventricular inotropic state was significantly higher during and post-infusion. 
These animals also exhibited an increase in heart rate. There were no treatment-related changes in 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) in any dose group. Although respiratory sinus arrhythmia (a common 
occurrence in the dog) was frequently observed, no treatment-related changes in rhythm were observed. 
There were no treatment-related cardiovascular effects in the 5 and 10 mg/kg dose groups. In the 
oritavancin clinical program there was no evidence of cardiac toxicity attributable to the administration of 
oritavancin as demonstrated by clinical cardiac adverse event, serious adverse event and ECG data as 
well as results from a thorough QTc study.  
No respiratory studies with oritavancin were reported. However, following a review of the pivotal 
non-clinical toxicity studies, no effect on respiratory function was observed. In addition, oritavancin had 
no effect on respiratory rate in a clinical thorough QTC study. These evaluations showed no evidence of 
oritavancin-induced effects on respiratory function.  
The effect of oritavancin on renal function and water/electrolyte excretion was determined in female rats 
administered a single dose of 5, 15 or 50 mg/kg oritavancin. Immediately after administration of 
oritavancin, the rats were administered an oral dose of 25 ml 0.9% saline solution/kg for hydration. 
Animals in the 50 mg/kg oritavancin dose group exhibited a 27% increase in serum creatinine, and 
animals in the 15 and 50 mg/kg dose groups exhibited a 2% increase in serum osmolality. In addition, 
animals in the 15 and 50 mg/kg dose groups exhibited decreases in the total excretion of sodium (56% 
and 65%, respectively) and its counter ion, chloride (33% and 46%, respectively). Animals in the 50 
mg/kg group exhibited a 26% decrease in the total number of osmols, urine volume decreased by 40%, 
and creatinine clearance was decreased by 33%. The no observed effect level for changes in renal water 
and electrolyte excretion was 5 mg/kg.  
The applicant states that in single and repeat dose toxicity studies, treatment-related haemolysis was not 
observed. In addition, in the clinical studies, there were no reports of the presence of occult blood in 
urines, individuals did not exhibit haematological changes or evidence of haemolysis and there was no 
indication of any adverse renal effects based on the evaluation of serum creatinine calculated and clinical 
adverse events.  
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 18/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In mice, the administration of a single IV dose of up to 50 mg/kg had no effect on the charcoal meal 
transit time. This indicates that single therapeutic doses of oritavancin would not be expected to produce 
constipation or promote diarrhoea.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Oritavancin combinations with gentamicin, linezolid and rifampin were shown to be synergistic in vitro 
against MRSA strains with hVISA and VISA phenotypes. Oritavancin synergises with gentamicin in vivo as 
evidenced by efficacy studies in a rabbit model of VRE endocarditis in which oritavancin alone was poorly 
active. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical PK and/or toxicokinetics (TK) and metabolism of oritavancin were assessed in a series of 
in-vitro and in-vivo studies. 
Absorption  
The pharmacokinetics of IV oritavancin was studied in mice, rats and dogs. Oritavancin exhibited linear, 
dose proportional plasma kinetics with maximal levels attained at the first sampling time point after the 
end of infusion. There were no gender differences in the PK among the different species in repeat dose 
studies and there was no plasma accumulation of oritavancin following multiple dosing.  
Oritavancin was originally developed for repeat dose administration in the clinic. Therefore, there are only 
a limited number of single dose PK studies conducted with oritavancin and often only one animal was 
sampled per time point. Oritavancin exhibited a terminal plasma half-life that ranged from 8 h to 33 h in 
mice, from 4 h to14 h in rats and 66.9 h in dogs. The variation in half-lives for oritavancin in all three 
species was attributed to the heterogeneity from study to study in the data time points used to calculate 
half-life. The time points used to calculate the terminal half-lives ranged from 4-48 h in mice, 1-60 h in 
rats and 48-168 h for the dog study. The terminal half-life of oritavancin in humans is 245 h. The 
difference in sampling time points may explain the shorter terminal half-lives in animals compared to 
humans. 
The PK parameters of oritavancin were determined in neutropenic female mice. The PK profiles were 
similar in neutropenic and non-neutropenic mice administered oritavancin by the IV route. 
Distribution  
The serum protein binding of oritavancin was similar (~85%) between mouse, rat, dog, and human 
matrices. In vitro studies indicated that oritavancin was neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the efflux 
transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Except for P-gp studies, no transporter protein studies with oritavancin 
were reported. However, to comply with current guidelines, the applicant will initiate transporter studies. 
Tissue distribution studies in rats and dogs indicated that oritavancin administered IV is widely distributed 
throughout the body achieving peak levels by 1-6 h post-dose. There was a long tissue residence time 
with radioactivity still present at moderate levels 7 days post-dose. These results were consistent with 
histopathological findings from toxicity studies indicating the presence of macrophages containing 
eosinophilic granules, presumably from oritavancin uptake, in tissues throughout the body even following 
treatment-free periods. Studies in pregnant rats indicate no placental transfer of oritavancin to the fetus; 
however, oritavancin was excreted in milk in lactating dams and orally absorbed by nursing pups and 
widely distributed to all tissues. 
Metabolism  
Oritavancin did not appear to be metabolised and was eliminated intact. Comparison of plasma 
concentrations of oritavancin to plasma radio-equivalent concentrations of 14C-oritavancin suggested that 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 19/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
there were no circulating metabolites of oritavancin in the plasma. Furthermore, analysis of plasma and 
bile from mice, rats and dogs administered single IV doses of 14C-oritavancin did not indicate the presence 
of metabolites of oritavancin. In addition, in vitro monkey hepatic microsomal metabolism studies did not 
show any evidence to suggest that oritavancin is metabolised by the CYP system. There were no 
metabolite peaks observed and there was no depletion of oritavancin over time. These results are 
consistent with studies of oritavancin incubated in the presence of human liver microsomes that did not 
show evidence of metabolism.   
In human hepatocytes, oritavancin at concentrations ≤ 50 μM did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 activities. At 50 μM oritavancin slightly increased CYP2E1 activity. At 2.5 μM 
oritavancin slightly increased CYP3A4 activity but at higher concentrations inhibited CYP3A4 activity. The 
SmPC states that oritavancin is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9. No information on the potential for inhibition 
of CYP2C8 was provided. 
Excretion  
In rats and dogs, oritavancin is excreted unchanged primarily via the bile into the faeces. After 14 days of 
administration to rats approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated in the faeces, approximately 5% in 
the urine and the remaining dose was still in the carcass, reflective of the long tissue retention times. 
Dogs showed a similar pattern of excretion. However, by 14 days approximately 10% of the dose was 
recovered in faeces, 6% in the urine and the remaining dose was still in the carcass. The long retention 
times in animals are consistent with observations in humans where < 5% of the administered dose was 
recovered in urine and faeces after 14 days of dose administration. In humans, oritavancin is eliminated 
in the urine and faeces. 
Drug interactions  
Specific animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. In 
a pharmacodynamic drug interaction study in rabbits, plasma histamine levels of animals treated with 
oritavancin and desipramine (a CYP2D6 substrate) were similar to those of animals treated with 
oritavancin alone. In a clinical study, there was no appreciable effect of oritavancin on the 
pharmacokinetics of desipramine. No other studies were reported in the Non-clinical Overview. The 
Clinical Report provides an assessment of drug interactions with oritavancin. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
A single dose toxicity study was conducted in rats administered an IV dose of 40, 80 or 120 mg/kg 
oritavancin. Mortality occurred in rats administered 120 mg/kg oritavancin. The clinical findings observed 
(decreased activity, hunched posture, severely swollen, dark-blue tongues, intermittent tremors, red 
soiling of perineal and muzzle areas, ataxia, red lacrimation and/or decreased faeces) were consistent 
with histamine-like infusion reactions. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose IV toxicity studies were conducted in rats and dogs. Pivotal toxicology studies were one 
month and 13 weeks in duration which is acceptable to support the intended single dose IV regimen in 
humans. In addition, cumulative area under the curve (AUC0-t) exposure levels for oritavancin at the no 
observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were multiples (range: 2.4 to 11.9 fold) higher than human 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 20/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exposure levels and sufficiently high to qualify impurities in the drug substance. Lower multiples were 
seen in the 2 week studies. 
The results of the repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs indicated that the primary adverse effect 
was the presence of eosinophilic granules in tissue macrophages throughout the body, including Kupffer 
cells of the liver, and macrophages of the intestinal mucosa, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. The 
appearance of the granules is most likely the result of oritavancin uptake by the macrophages. The 
eosinophilic granule containing macrophages were evident following two weeks of dosing, were 
associated with all dose levels, and were still evident following recovery periods. The eosinophilic granules 
were occasionally associated with mild inflammatory lesions, particularly in the liver, and some studies in 
rats showed an increase in serum globulin another indicator of inflammation.  
The presence of eosinophilic granules did not occur following single dose administration by either IV bolus 
or slow infusion. Therefore, the observation of eosinophilic granules in repeated dose studies may have 
less clinical effect in the single dose setting. 
Clinical findings associated with identifying the NOAELs in rats and dogs included decreased mean 
erythrocytic parameters such as erythrocyte count, haemoglobin and packed cell volume. The decrease in 
erythrocytes was typically accompanied with a regenerative response, indicated by an increase in 
reticulocyte count and evidence of increased extramedullary haematopoiesis in the splenic pulp and liver 
at higher doses. There were also increased levels of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate 
transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin that was associated with increased liver 
weights, macroscopic findings of pale livers, microscopic findings of eosinophilic granules in Kupffer cells, 
and occasional histopathologic findings of hepatocellular vacuolar degeneration and necrosis. There were 
slight effects in clinical chemistry parameters consistent with minimal effects on renal function including 
slight increases in blood urea nitrogen, sporadic increases in creatinine, and decreases in urine specific 
activity. These changes were occasionally associated with histopathologic findings such as renal cortical 
tubular nephrosis. Increased organ weights (absolute and relative) for liver, spleen and kidney were 
frequently observed. These findings had partially or completely reversed during the recovery periods. The 
clinical relevance of the haematology, hepatic and renal effects observed in rats and dogs observed with 
IV oritavancin was not provided by the applicant. However, the results of the SOLO clinical studies 
indicate that oritavancin-induced haematological, hepatic or renal effects in humans were similar to those 
seen in vancomycin-treated subjects.  
The applicant states that in a 2 week study in rats, the increase in adrenal weight in the females dosed 15 
mg/kg/day was probably secondary to the stress of toxicity. 
In a 13-week toxicity study in rats administered IV doses of 5, 15, or 45/30 mg/kg/day oritavancin, 
mortalities occurred in all dose groups and control animals. The mortalities were attributed to increased 
bacterial infection in dextrose-vehicle treated animals. 
In dogs, the most notable dose limiting toxicity was a moderate to severe histamine reaction that was 
most pronounced during the first few days of dosing and waned during the study period. The effects were 
manageable by pre-treatment with anti-histamines such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride and 
epinephrine, fluid therapy and oxygen. The severity of these reactions increased with higher doses or 
infusion rates and lessened with repeated administrations. There were no cardiovascular effects in dogs 
based on ECG recordings that showed normal cardiac rates, rhythm and conduction. ECG analysis was 
conducted at regular intervals during the 1 month and 13 week studies.

Genotoxicity 
In genotoxicity studies conducted with oritavancin, there were no gene mutations or chromosomal 
damage observed in any of the studies. No mutagenicity or clastogenicity was observed in studies 
conducted with oritavancin spiked with 4.7% alkylated Factor A. Therefore, neither oritavancin nor the 
impurities in the drug substance were shown to be genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with oritavancin. This is acceptable. In view of the results of 
the genotoxicity studies conducted and the proposed short duration of clinical treatment with oritavancin, 
in compliance with ICH guidelines, carcinogenicity studies are not required. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In rats administered IV doses of ≤30 mg/kg/day oritavancin, there were no adverse effects on gonadal 
function, mating performance, fertility or early gestation. The NOAEL for reproductive parameters was 30 
mg/kg. In female rats administered IV doses of ≤30 mg/kg/day throughout a 2 week premating period, 
during mating (with groups of untreated males) and through gestation Day (GD) 7, no treatment-related 
effects on gonadal function, mating behaviour and reproduction was observed. In this study the NOAEL 
was 30 mg/kg. In another study, IV doses of ≤30 mg/kg/day oritavancin had no effect on implantation or 
embryo-fetal development when administered to rats during the pre-implantation period of pregnancy 
(GDs 0 to 5). 
Embryo-fetal developmental studies were conducted in rats and rabbits administered IV doses of 
oritavancin. No embryo-fetal developmental effects were observed in rats administered ≤30 mg/kg 
oritavancin on GDs 6 to 17 or rabbits administered ≤15 mg/kg oritavancin on GDs 7 to 19.  
In a pre and postnatal development study, F0 maternal body weight and food consumption were 
decreased after oritavancin administration in the 30 mg/kg group during the postnatal period. There were 
no adverse effects on pregnancy, parturition or lactation. Offspring (F1) of animals in the 30 mg/kg dose 
group had lower body weights during the study intervals although not during the post-weaning period 
(postnatal Days (PND) 8 to 57), but had normal physical development. F1 neuro-behavioural and 
reproductive functions were not affected by oritavancin administration at any dose. There were no 
oritavancin-related effects observed in the F2 generation. No oritavancin treatment-related effects were 
observed at doses ≤15 mg/kg/day in the F0 and F1 generations and 30 mg/kg in the F2 generation. 
In juvenile toxicity studies in rats, administered oritavancin at doses of ≥15 mg/kg resulted in increased 
body weight and liver and spleen weights and decreased red blood cell count and haematocrit.  Mortalities 
occurred in the 45/30 mg/kg/day dose group. No treatment-related effects were seen at 5 mg/kg/day. 
In a juvenile toxicity study in dogs, oritavancin administered at doses of 15 and 45 mg/kg were associated 
with clinical observations and decreased mean body weights and body weight gains. Macroscopic and 
microscopic findings were associated with the injection sites, liver, and lymph nodes in the 45 mg/kg dose 
group. No oritavancin-related effects were present in the 5 mg/kg dose group. Juvenile dogs administered 
IV doses of 45 mg/kg for 30 days, showed vacuoles within hepatocyte cytoplasm that is suggestive of 
diffuse glycogen accumulation. This change was reported to account for the pale livers seen during 
necropsy. The applicant proposed that the juvenile animals may be more sensitive to anaphylactic-like 
reactions compared to adult animals. It is noted that the applicant has proposed to conduct 2 clinical 
studies to provide clinical safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data in the paediatric population.

Toxicokinetic data 
In general, the systemic exposure of oritavancin increased with dose. However, repeated administration 
of oritavancin did not lead to an increase in its exposure or accumulation. 
At the NOAELs in the pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies conducted with oritavancin in rats and dogs, 
AUC values achieved at the NOAEL doses were between 0.23 and 11.92x the recommended human AUC 
value. An adequate discussion of the low multiples of exposure to oritavancin seen in the pivotal 
repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs was not provided by the applicant. However, the 
non-clinical findings did not appear to be clinically relevant since the incidence of correlative findings in 
subjects in the SOLO clinical trials was low, with comparable rates and severity between the oritavancin 
and vancomycin-treated groups. 
Local Tolerance  
Injection site tolerability studies were not conducted with oritavancin. However, injection sites of rats and 
dogs were examined as part of the toxicity studies. Local irritations at the injection site, in particular 
during tail vein infusions in rats, were dose-related and often dose-limiting. In local tolerance studies 
conducted with rabbits, oritavancin had no effect on ear vein irritation and was a slight dermal and ocular 
irritant. 
Antigenicity  
No antigenicity studies with oritavancin were reported. Allergic reactions to oritavancin are reflected in 
section 4.3 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Immunotoxicity  
A series of studies were conducted to determine whether oritavancin affected immune function. In 
immunotoxicity studies in rats, no consistent effect on antibody response was observed, but evidence of 
a possible reversible decrease in host resistance was reported. In vitro studies were conducted to 
evaluate the functional status of macrophage cell lines incubated in the presence of oritavancin at 
concentrations that resulted in intracellular levels that exceeded those anticipated in humans 
administered the 1200 mg dose. The studies showed that oritavancin-loaded macrophage cells retained 
full functional capabilities. 
Dependence  
No dependence studies with oritavancin have been reported. This is acceptable as there is no indication 
that oritavancin would cause dependence. 
Metabolites  
No metabolite toxicity studies with oritavancin have been reported. This is acceptable as no circulating 
metabolites of oritavancin were detected in the plasma of any of the species studied.  
Impurities  
A study was conducted to qualify impurities present at different levels in different engineered lots of 
oritavancin in male rats. Oritavancin was administered to rats by IV infusion at dose levels of 28 mg/kg 
and 60 mg/kg. Mortality was observed at 60 mg/kg (Lot #1169-142) and adverse microscopic findings 
were observed locally at the infusion site for animals treated at 60 mg/kg (Lot #124RM5 and 
#23480-134). Based on these findings, there was no systemic toxicity associated with IV infusion of 28 
mg/kg (Lot #1169-142) and 60 mg/kg (Lot #124RM5 and #23480-134).

In another study in rats administered IV doses of oritavancin spiked with alkylated Factor A to a level of 
4.7% (Lot # FV3-LHK-210*AA) for 14 days, the 15 mg/kg dose group exhibited evidence of mild general 
toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption), a mild inflammatory response (slight anaemia, 
leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia and increased serum globulin), and hepatic effects (increased serum 
transaminases and liver weight). These effects were generally not present in animals in the 5 mg/kg dose 
group. In addition, systemic phagocytosis of material presumed to be related to oritavancin (eosinophilic 
granule deposition) was observed in all dose groups, but was not associated with any evidence of toxicity 
in the 1 or 5 mg/kg dose groups. The effects noted in the current study were very similar to those 
observed in prior two week toxicity studies indicating that the presence of alkylated Factor A at a level of 
4.7% did not increase toxicity. The NOAEL for oritavancin spiked with alkylated Factor A was considered 
to be 5 mg/kg. 
A toxicity study was conducted in rats administered IV doses of 0 (vehicle), 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg oritavancin 
(Lot # 73743-196E) containing Total Known Impurities (18.8%), oritavancin Factor C (3.0%) and 
alkylated Factor A (3.8%) for 28 days. The findings in this study using oritavancin spiked with several 
impurities were similar to those of the other 28 day toxicity study conducted in rats with oritavancin Lot 
# 124RM5. The NOAEL for the current study was 5 mg/kg. 
An additional 2 week repeat dose toxicity study was conducted in rats administered IV doses of 1, 5, or 15 
mg/kg oritavancin that contained higher amounts of the impurities Dev A, oritavancin Factor C, related 
substance M, and alkylated Factor A compared to Lot 124RM5 that was used in prior toxicity studies. The 
effects of oritavancin on haematological endpoints, as well as the spleen and upon the liver observed in 
the 15 mg/kg dose group are generally consistent with prior findings in rats. The effects observed in the 
5 mg/kg dose group were slight, more evident in females than males and considered transitional and 
non-adverse. The NOAEL was considered to be 5 mg/kg which is consistent with other toxicity studies 
using different lots of material. However, there were three unscheduled deaths in this study. It was stated 
that the amount of intracytoplasmic granular material within histiocytes/mononuclear cells of the tissues 
examined suggested that these three animals may have had higher exposure levels than other animals 
within the 15 mg/kg/day dose group. The three unscheduled deaths were attributed to 
bacteraemia/septicaemia and not to oritavancin.  
Other toxicity studies 
In several studies there was an increase in activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). A subsequent 
in-vitro study determined that increased APTT is a result of oritavancin binding to phospholipids present 
in the assay system. Consequently, it should be noted that APTT results are dependent on the timing that 
blood samples are taken for analysis. An investigative in-vivo study in rats established a direct correlation 
between oritavancin plasma levels and increased APTT but this result was discounted due to data 
indicating that oritavancin artificially prolongs APTT.   
In an in vitro study, the killing of Candida albicans, S. aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii remained 
intact after the loading of mouse or human macrophages to substantial intracellular levels of oritavancin 
or azithromycin. These data indicated that the accumulation of oritavancin in macrophages does not 
prevent phagocytic killing of key pathogens. In addition, in mouse or human macrophage cell lines, 
oritavancin did not significantly affect the measured cellular functions i.e. phagocytosis of the 
Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, generation of reactive oxidant species, endocytosis, 
lysosomal integrity and metabolic activity. The phagocytosis of latex beads by mouse macrophages was 
reduced by 50 % but was unaffected in human macrophages. In an in vivo study in rats, single IV doses 
of ≤30 mg/kg oritavancin were not associated with eosinophilic granule formation. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 24/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Environmental risks from the societal use of oritavancin were characterised using its physical-chemical 
and environmental fate properties, conservatively predicted environmental exposure levels, and 
predicted environmental toxicity. 
Several studies were conducted previously to assess the environmental fate and effects of oritavancin. 
However, the underlying study reports were unavailable for several historical studies and no chronic 
toxicity testing had been conducted to date. As a result, several new studies were completed and results 
were incorporated into the ERA: Municipal Sewage Sludge Adsorption/Desorption Coefficient (US EPA 
OCSPP 835.1110); Aerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems (OECD 308); Activated Sludge 
Respiration Inhibition Test (OECD 209); Sediment/Water Chironomid Toxicity Test (OECD 218); Algal 
Growth Inhibition (OECD 201); Fish, Early Life Stage (OECD 210); and Daphnid Reproduction Test (OECD 
211). All final test reports were submitted. 
Oritavancin was screened for PBT using a stepwise procedure in accordance with REACH Guidance and 
was found to not be a PBT substance. In Phase I, a conservatively estimated PECSURFACEWATER (not 
accounting for removal during sewage treatment, environmental degradation, or human metabolic 
losses) was derived. Oritavancin's PECSURFACEWATER exceeded the action value, triggering a Phase II 
assessment. 
Phase II – Environmental Fate and Effects Analysis 
Environmental Fate 
Adsorption Desorption behaviour 
The submitted test on adsorption is acceptable. The results are mentioned in the table of main study 
results. The CHMP uses the KD value of 1375 for the PECsediment calculation. 
Transformation in water-sediment systems 
The very low DT50 values in the OECD 308 give the impression that there is a high transformation in 
water sediment systems. For evaluating these results it should be noted there is a very high amount of 
the substance or its transformation products (TP) which is partitioning into the sediment compartment 
where it is not extractable any more. Consequently, it cannot be excluded that the parent compound or 
some of the TP are persistent in the environment. At the end of the test one TP is increasing which gives 
further evidence of persistence. 
Environmental Effects 
Toxicity to aquatic organisms and microorganism 
The most sensitive organism is the algae Anabaena flos-aquae. The submitted effect test is not valid 
because the variation coefficient for section-by-section growth rate is clearly higher than required by the 
OECD protocol 201 (50% in the test, 35% required by the guideline). As it is demonstrated in public 
available literature the requirements of the OECD guideline are feasible also for Anabaena flos-aquae 
(Ebert et al., 2011)1. Therefore the CHMP asks for a new test. The long-term tests on daphnids, fish and 
sediment organisms (Chironomus riparius) are valid to the requirements of the OECD guidelines and were 
accepted by the CHMP. The results are included in the summary of main study results.

Remarks 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
The ERA cannot be concluded on the risk for surface water. The applicant is asked to provide a new study 
which meets all validation criteria of the OECD guideline 201. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The primary adverse effect of oritavancin administration to rats and dogs was a dose related 
accumulation of eosinophilic granules in tissue macrophages including hepatocytes, renal cortical 
epithelial cells, adrenal cells and macrophages of the reticulo endothelial system.  The appearance of the 
eosinophilic granules did not occur following single dose administration and did not significantly affect 
innate macrophage function in vitro at intracellular levels anticipated from a single 1,200 mg dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 26/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moderate, dose-related increases in liver enzymes (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase) 
were observed in rats and dogs and were shown to be reversible upon cessation of treatment. 
Biochemistry changes associated with kidney function including decreases in urine-specific gravity and pH 
and slight increases in blood urea nitrogen and sporadic increases in creatinine were present in both rat 
and dog after treatment of two weeks. Extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen was observed in rats. 
This histopathological finding correlated with an enlargement and an increase in the weight of the spleen. 
The exposure in rats at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was less to only slightly higher than 
the human exposure based on the AUC. 
Histamine-like infusion reactions following immediately or shortly after dosing with oritavancin occurred 
in both rats and dogs. These reactions were associated with mortality at lower dosages in male than in 
female rats in single dose studies; however, the same gender-related differences were not observed in 
other species. Studies in neonatal rats and dogs for 30 days showed the same tissue effects as those seen 
in adult animals including sensitivity to the oritavancin-mediated histamine-like infusion reactions. 
Mortality was observed in neonatal rats at slightly lower dosage levels than in adults. 
A standard battery of in-vitro and in-vivo tests on the genotoxic potential did not reveal any clinically 
relevant findings. Lifetime studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic 
potential of oritavancin.  
When administered intravenously at doses up to 30 mg/kg, oritavancin did not affect the fertility or 
reproductive performance of male and female rats. Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or 
postnatal development. There was no evidence of transplacental transfer of oritavancin in pregnant rats. 
The exposure in rats at the NOAEL was less to only slightly higher than the human exposure based on the 
AUC. 
Following a single intravenous infusion in lactating rats, radio-labelled [14C]oritavancin was excreted in 
milk and absorbed by nursing pups. 
With regards to the ERA, no final conclusion on environmental risk assessment is possible, because it 
cannot be concluded on the risk for surface water. The effect test to algae should be repeated. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address the issue related to non-clinical aspects: 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
The submitted effect study on algae is not valid. The applicant is asked to provide a new study which 
meets all validation criteria of the OECD guideline 201. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 27/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
In study ARRI 20/21 patients enrolled at site 131 were excluded from the CE population because of drug 
accountability and unblinding issues. The sponsor audited three sites that participated in the study and 
the US FDA inspections of the sponsor did not raise any major issues. 
In study SOLO II there was one study site (207002) at which patients were screened for study entry but 
the ruler measurements and planimetry of the index infection site occurred after surgical treatment of the 
lesion. The signs and symptoms associated with the index lesion and its size prior to surgical treatment 
were not reported in the eCRF. There were 58 patients enrolled at this site and to compensate for this 
error an additional 58 patients (over the planned 960 patients) were enrolled at other sites. Sensitivity 
analyses of early clinical response, investigator-assessed clinical cure at PTE, lesion size reduction ≥ 20% 
at ECE and sustained clinical response at PTE in the MITT and CE populations were conducted excluding 
the data from this site. 
The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice 
In the initial MAA of 2008, the prior applicant (Targanta) sought approval for oritavancin to treat cSSTI 
using 200 mg IV daily for 3-7 days. Due to concerns that mainly centred around the single pivotal study 
and issues raised by the results, including the comparative cure rates for MRSA, as well as new data that 
became available during the procedure suggesting that the once daily regimen was not optimal, the 
application was withdrawn. In parallel, the application to FDA was also withdrawn. 
Subsequent to this withdrawal, CHMP scientific advice was sought in 2010 mainly to discuss the plans for 
two new pivotal Phase 3 studies in cSSTI using the 1200 mg single dose regimen. The applicant’s 
justification for pursuing the 1200 mg single dose, based on revised PK/PD analyses and the results of the 
additional study TAR-ORI-SD001 (SIMPLIFI), was accepted. The design features of the two planned 
studies were also generally acceptable, with a few suggestions made. 
Additional questions concerned the plan for bioburden testing of the drug product, the possible need to 
conduct additional non-clinical studies and/or a new TQT study with doses adequate to cover the new 
regimen, the sufficiency of completed and planned investigations to further assess any impact of 
accumulation within macrophages and the proposal for further evaluation of DDIs. 
The two new Phase 3 studies that have assessed a 1200 mg single dose for treatment of cSSTI (SOLO I 
and II) have been designed in accordance with CPMP/EWP/558/95 Rev 2 and they also comply with the 
recommendations made in the Addendum to this guideline.

Note: Studies in grey did not include PK sampling. Total patient numbers represent randomized patients. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Oritavancin pharmacokinetics was assessed in subjects and patients in the studies as shown in the above 
table: Phase 1 (13 trials), 2 (3 trials) and 3 (3 trials). 
A range of different assay methods have been used and at different laboratories during the long clinical 
development period, including initially RIA, HPLC with fluorescence detection and LC/MS/MS. The latter 
was used in the majority of studies for determining concentrations in plasma and other fluids with a linear 
range for plasma and urine of 12.5 – 1000 ng/mL.  Oritavancin binds to labware surfaces at low drug 
concentrations. This does not occur in the presence of plasma or 0.002% polysorbate-80. For RIA all 
assays were performed in a solution that contained 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.05% Triton X-100. In the 
HPLC-based assays all dilutions were at pH ≤ 3, which prevents binding to surfaces. A cross-study 
comparison of plasma levels of oritavancin using RIA, LC-fluorescence and LC/MS/MS demonstrated the 
consistency of the results derived from the three assay methods for similar or identical administered 
doses. 
ADME 
 Single dose studies 
In ARRK oritavancin was administered over 30 min in 300 mL D5W at 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 mg/kg. The ranges 
observed for PK parameters are shown below.

In JE-101N the doses ranged from 0.02 up to 3.0 mg/kg. The mean Vss was 65.2 L/kg and t½ ranged 
from 7-13 days. There was no statistically significant relationship detected between plasma clearance or 
Vss and body weight. Plasma AUC0-inf and Cmax increased in a dose-proportional fashion over the range 
27.5 mg to 208 mg (a 7.6-fold range). 
Figure 1 
Table 3 
Multiple dose studies 
In ARRB 1.5 mg/kg/day oritavancin was administered intravenously over 30 min in up to 300 mL D5W 
once daily for 2-7 days. Based on data from 9 male subjects, Cmax ranged from 14.5 - 28.7 μg/mL after 
the first dose and concentrations at the end of the first 24-h dosing interval ranged from 0.90 - 1.57 
μg/mL. No apparent increase in Cmax was observed with multiple dosing. Individual 
dose/weight-normalised Cmax values were consistent across doses.

Modest accumulation (approximately 2.83-fold) was observed in Cmin after seven daily doses.  
Figure 2 
In ARRN the final doses administered were 100, 150 and 200 mg given over 30 or 60 minutes in 50 or 
100 mL D5W once a day for 10 days. The mean AUC ratios indicated accumulations of 2.3 to 2.6-fold at 
the three dose levels. Cmin increased by 2.4 - 2.8-fold and there was no significant increase in Cmax. No 
statistically significant dose effect was observed on the accumulation ratios. 
Figure 3 
Protein binding 
An initial in-vitro study suggested that oritavancin is 85.7%, 88.8% and 89.9% bound to human plasma 
proteins at respective drug concentrations of 1, 10 and 91 μg/mL. Most binding of oritavancin in serum 
was to albumin. The study did not take into account non-specific binding losses but the estimated protein 
binding was very similar to that obtained in a later study (85%), which used a validated growth-based

method. A further study using a biophysical method that employs cantilever arrays gave an estimated 
fraction bound to HSA of 0.79 when testing 0.1 µM oritavancin in 600 µM HSA.   
Volume of distribution 
Based on POPPK analysis, the central volume of distribution (Vc) in humans is 5.9 L, which is similar to 
plasma volume but the total volume of distribution (Vc + V2 + V3) is approximately 100 L, suggesting 
that oritavancin is widely distributed to tissues.  
Oritavancin was found to be excreted in breast milk in non-clinical studies and data in nursing pups 
indicated that oritavancin is absorbed by these neonatal animals  
OCSI-001 assessed blister fluid levels in healthy male subjects. Oritavancin levels were maximal in 
blister fluid after 9 to 10 h after the last dose and became undetectable 100 to 150 h after the last dose. 
The mean AUC blister/AUC plasma ratios at 24 h were similar at the two dose levels examined, indicating 
that at both dose levels the blister fluid exposures were ~20% of plasma exposures. Since 10-14% 
oritavancin is unbound to serum proteins the blister fluid AUC was slightly higher than predicted, 
suggesting that inflammation might have enhanced the passage of oritavancin from blood to blister fluid. 
Whether macrophages which accumulate oritavancin and migrate to inflamed tissues contributed to this 
enhancement is unknown. 
Table 4 
OPUL-001 compared concentrations of oritavancin and vancomycin in plasma, epithelial lining fluid 
(ELF) and alveolar macrophages (AM). Each subject was to have a single bronchoscopy and BAL 
performed after the start of the last dose of study drug. Blood was collected for up to 48 h post-last dose. 
The highest ELF concentration of oritavancin was detected in the samples at 24 h post-dose (6.3 μg/mL) 
but the highest plasma concentration was detected at 4 h (119.6 μg/mL), which suggested that 
oritavancin slowly distributed into and out of the ELF. The estimated AUC0-24 in AM was 31-fold that in 
ELF.

Table 5 
o  Excretion 
In rats, mice and dogs the mass balance studies demonstrated slow elimination of oritavancin via urine 
and via bile into the faeces. There was prolonged retention of radioactivity after single doses of 
[14C]oritavancin.  
In ARRK (single doses from 0.5 to 3 mg/kg) plasma concentrations of oritavancin followed a 
tri-exponential decline and were mostly < 10% of Cmax within 24 h. A three-compartment model was 
selected as the most appropriate for all subjects based on the comparisons of objective function values 
and standard error of the estimates. The mean t1/2 was estimated to be 251 h (approximately 10.5 days). 
The area under the terminal phase represented more than 50% of total AUC. Less than 3.1% of the 
administered dose was recovered in the urine after 2 weeks of collection. The mean systemic plasma 
clearance (CLp) was estimated at 0.0896 mL/min/kg. 
In the multiple dose study ARRB plasma concentrations followed a tri-exponential decline to < 20% 
Cmax within 24 h. The estimated mean terminal half-life of oritavancin was 277 hours (11.5 days). The 
model-predicted mean clearance was 0.0682 mL/min/kg and mean systemic plasma clearance (CLp) was 
0.306 L/h. The applicant has concluded that oritavancin is excreted unchanged in faeces and urine. Mean 
population-predicted half-lives in patients were similar to those in healthy volunteers with α, β and γ 
half-lives of approximately 2, 31 and 393 h, respectively.  
o  Metabolism 
A mass balance (metabolite profiling) study using radiolabelled oritavancin has not been performed in 
man. Oritavancin was not metabolised in studies in dogs and rats.  
In human liver microsomes using oritavancin (10 or 100 μM) no unique metabolite peak that was 
dependent on the NADPH-generating system, microsomal protein and substrate concentrations was 
detected by fluorescence or UV methods. There was no difference in the area under the peak curve of 
oritavancin in control experiments compared to those without NADPH or microsomes i.e. no depletion of 
oritavancin due to metabolism could be detected. The conclusion was that there was no evidence that 
oritavancin is metabolised by the human cytochrome P450 system. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In ARRO after 100 mg and 600 mg doses the mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ increased proportionally with dose 
from 24.1 to 111 μg/mL and from 280 to 1560 μg•h/mL, respectively. The Vdss and CLp were consistent 
across the dose range studied (65.8 L [0.83 L/kg] and 0.431 L/h, respectively). No effect of body weight 
or gender (7/16 with data were female) was observed on CLp or Vdss. The mean documented t1/2 was 
194 h (8 days).

Oritavancin does not appear to demonstrate time-dependent PK. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In SOLO I and II patients enrolled at selected sites underwent PK sampling at 3, 12, 24, 72 and 576 h after 
the start of the infusion. A pooled analysis was conducted based on a total of 1337 plasma concentrations 
from 110 patients in SOLO I and 187 in SOLO II, including 4-5 values from the majority of the patients. 
Plasma exposure and secondary PK parameter estimates were calculated for each patient by simulating a 
concentration-time profile using the final model or using accepted PK equations. The structure of the 
previous POPPK model provided an excellent fit to the concentration-time data. Excellent fits to the 
individual patient PK data were obtained. Summary statistics of the derived PK exposures, stratified by 
study and pooled across studies, showed a Vss ~100 L, indicating wide distribution. The estimated t1/2 
values indicated rapid initial distribution followed by a slower secondary distribution phase and slow 
terminal elimination.

Mean Concentration-Time Profile Following Oritavancin 1200 mg IV over 3 h – Semi-Log Scale 
The POPPK parameter estimates showed that the volume of distribution was about 50% lower in the SOLO 
vs. previous clinical studies. In addition, the mean T1/2,β and T1/2,γ values in SOLO I and II were 
substantially lower than those observed in previous Phase 2/3 studies. For example, mean T1/2,β in the 
297 patients from SOLO I and SOLO II was 13.4 h vs. a mean of 31.2 h in the 360 Phase 2/3 patients 
included in the previous analysis while mean T1/2,γ values were 245 and 393 h, respectively. In contrast, 
the mean T1/2,α values were similar (2.29 h vs. 2.04 h).  
The applicant considered that the contrasts may reflect differences in dose regimen, duration of infusion 
and PK sampling schemes. The duration of PK sampling in ARRL and ARRD (49% of patients in prior 
analysis) was 24 h vs. 576 h in the SOLO studies. Sampling was also relatively dense in the previous 
Phase 2/3 studies (> 10 per patient) while a maximum of 5 per patient were obtained in the SOLO studies, 
albeit at optimal times. Despite the differences in β and γ T1/2 estimates the dose-normalized AUC0-24 
values were similar. 
Traditional covariate model building techniques identified two statistically significant relationships: 
i)  
A relationship between age and Vc, where Vc decreased with increasing age and  
ii)  
A relationship between height and CL, where CL increased with increasing height

These relationships explained a relatively small amount (<5%) of inter-individual variability in oritavancin 
PK. Patient age and height were only modestly related to clinically relevant PK parameters (i.e. Cmax and 
AUC0-72). Therefore, dose modifications were not considered necessary based on age or height. 
Special populations 
o 
Impaired renal function 
In the POPPK analysis renal function had no impact on PK oritavancin within the range of CLcr observed 
in patients (29.8 – 216 mL/min/m2). The scatterplot of dose-normalized AUC0-72 vs. CLcr showed a lack 
of any clear relationship between the two parameters. The table shows the summary statistics by renal 
function category. Note that estimates for severe renal impairment are based on only 3 patients. 
Table 8 
An in-vitro study evaluated the clearance of oritavancin by conventional (low-flux), high-flux and CRRT 
dialysis filters. The mean dialytic clearance value was found to be zero for the low-flux filters (absolute 
calculated value - 6.0 ml/min), zero for the high-flux filters (absolute calculated value - 5.8 ml/min) and 
zero for the CRRT dialysis (absolute calculated value - 5.2 ml/min).  
o 
Impaired hepatic function 
OCSI-004 was a single-dose, open-label, parallel-group study to compare administration of oritavancin 
to subjects with Child-Pugh Class B (score 7-10) liver insufficiency and healthy subjects who were 
matched approximately on the basis of sex, ± 5 years of age, ± 30% body weight and smoking habits. 
Each subject received a single 800 mg dose of oritavancin.  
At every sampling time point oritavancin plasma concentrations were approximately 10% to 15% lower in 
subjects with hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects. Mean Cmax, AUC0-24 and AUC0-t 
were all slightly lower in subjects with hepatic impairment. However, AUCs were more variable than 
among healthy subjects. The mean Tmax values were similar.  
Despite the matching process, the subjects with hepatic impairment had higher body weight, lower serum 
albumin and higher incidence of ascites, which were all thought to contribute to a larger apparent Vd and 
hence lower plasma concentrations compared to healthy subjects.

Table 9 
In a second statistical analysis (in which PK parameters, including AUC values and Cmax, were adjusted 
by multiplying the value by the individual body weight and then dividing by the baseline albumin value 
within each subject) the adjusted AUC0-t, AUC0-24 and Cmax values were still numerically lower in the 
subjects with hepatic impairment compared to normal subjects but 90% CIs around the ratios were within 
the range of 0.80 to 1.25. The applicant concluded that the rate and extent of oritavancin exposure was 
numerically lower in subjects with hepatic impairment but the observed differences were small (the 
magnitude is less than would be seen in patient to patient variability) and did not indicate a need for dose 
adjustment. Unbound (free) oritavancin was not measured in this study. 
o  Elderly 
After administration of Oritavancin, Cmax increased modestly with increasing age, whereas AUC slightly 
decreased with increasing age. The data suggest that no dose adjustment is needed based on patient age.  
o  Children 
No studies in children were conducted.   
o  Other factors 
From the covariate analysis the applicant concluded that gender does not per se have a dramatic impact 
on the PK of oritavancin. Mean and median Cmax and AUC values were consistently higher in female 
patients with larger ranges but the applicant proposed this was most likely a reflection of the relationship 
between height and CL. Based on the results of the covariate analysis the applicant concluded that race 
has no impact on the PK of oritavancin.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Oritavancin was not a substrate for the cytochrome P450 system in human liver microsomes.  
The ability of oritavancin to inhibit the metabolism of marker catalytic activities for CYP3A4, CYP2D6, 
CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 was examined in vitro with human hepatocytes. At 25 μM oritavancin: 
o 
o 
o 
o 
Using midazolam 5 μM there was 39% inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism  
Using diclofenac 2.5 μM there was <10% inhibition of CYP2C9-mediated metabolism  
Conversion of phenacetin (at 12.5 μM) to acetaminophen by CYP1A2 was slightly inhibited (21%) 
Modelling  the  data  to  conventional  enzyme  inhibition  relationships,  the  form-selective 
biotransformation  for  CYD2D6  (1′-hydroxylation  of  bufuralol)  was  non-competitively  inhibited  by 
oritavancin yielding a Ki of 12.6 ± 1.3 ′-hydroxylation. 
The order of potential inhibition by oritavancin of the metabolism of co-administered drugs by the 
cytochrome P450 isoforms was determined to be CYP2D6>CYP3A4>CYP1A2>CYP2C9.

When HLMs were pre-incubated with oritavancin (2.5 up to 50 μM) and known substrates for CYP2D6 
(dextromethorphan) and 3A4 (testosterone) CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 were inhibited in a 
concentration-dependent manner. Oritavancin was initially reported to be a competitive inhibitor for both 
isoenzymes with Ki values of 21.9 and 31.7 µM, respectively, but re-analysis of the data indicated that 
inhibition of CYP3A4 was almost fully non-competitive whereas inhibition of CYP2D6 was mixed.  
Table 10 
A further study compared the abilities of oritavancin and telithromycin to inhibit human CYP enzymes 
using an in-vitro model based on biotransformation rates of index substrates by human liver microsomes. 
Oritavancin inhibited all isoforms tested without evidence of a time-dependent (mechanism-based) 
process, indicating that CYP inhibition is likely to be reversible. The IC50 values relative to typical Cmax 
(total drug) based on the POPPK analysis relevant to dosing at 200 QD were > 0.1. For the 1200 mg dose 
the Cmax/IC50 ratios all exceed 1.5. It was concluded that oritavancin is a relatively nonspecific inhibitor 
of all human CYP isoforms (similar to efavirenz and isoniazid) and the mechanism is likely to be 
non-competitive rather than competitive.

The potential for oritavancin to induce CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 
was  studied  in  cryopreserved  human  hepatocytes.  There  were  no  significant  increases  in  enzyme 
activities over 48 h except that: 
- 
- 
50 μM oritavancin induced CYP2E1 (activity 150% of vehicle control) whereas 25 µM did not give 
a significant increase (111% of vehicle control) 
2.5  μM  oritavancin  gave  some  increase  in  CYP3A4  (117%  of  vehicle  control)  but  at  higher 
concentrations there was evidence of inhibition of CYP3A4.  
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 38/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The enzyme activity vs. vehicle control decreased as oritavancin concentration increased (2.5, 25 and 50 
µM), and especially between the two latter concentrations, for CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. It 
was demonstrated that 50 µM was not cytotoxic to the hepatocytes. The oritavancin dosing solution was 
removed prior to adding the substrates for each isoenzyme so inhibition would not be expected after 
removal. Thus, the report postulated that the finding likely reflects persistence of protein-bound 
oritavancin in the hepatocytes. 
In Caco-2 monolayers and in the absence and presence of the P-gp inhibitors ciclosporin A (10 μM) and 
verapamil (100 μM) the apparent permeability of oritavancin was lower than that of mannitol (a 
well-known impermeable marker) in either direction, indicating that oritavancin has poor permeability 
and is not a P-gp substrate. In addition, oritavancin did not affect the efflux ratio of digoxin, suggesting 
that oritavancin is not a P-gp inhibitor.  
Oritavancin affects the results of the aPTT assay due to an in-vitro interaction with the phospholipids 
necessary for accurate aPTT estimation. There is no in-vitro or in-vivo evidence that oritavancin affects 
the coagulation system.  
In vivo 
OCSI-008 was a parallel-arm, open-label study in which healthy male and female subjects were 
allocated randomly to either: 
Arm A:  Desipramine 50 mg administered PO once daily from Day 1 to 7 followed by 
Desipramine 50 mg administered PO once daily and oritavancin 800 mg administered IV 
over 90 minutes once daily for 14 consecutive days (Days 8–21). 
Arm B:  Placebo administered PO once daily from Day 1 to 7 followed by 
Placebo administered PO daily and oritavancin 800 mg administered IV over 90 minutes 
daily for 14 consecutive days (Days 8–21). 
The sponsor terminated the study after most subjects had received only 3 or 4 doses of oritavancin 
because of the incidence and severity of phlebitis and systemic AEs. There were 29 in each treatment 
group that completed assessments through Day 8 of the study. There was no effect of desipramine on the 
mean pharmacokinetic parameters of oritavancin.  
Table 12 
There was a numerical decrease in desipramine Cmax and AUC from Day 7 (no oritavancin) to Day 8 (first 
dose of oritavancin). The sponsor proposed that lack of CYP2D6 inhibition could reflect low levels of 
unbound oritavancin but did not comment on the possibility of weak induction of 2D6.

Table 13 
The  accumulation  of  2-hydroxydesipramine  was  consistent  with  that  of  parent  drug  and  there  were 
numerical decreases in Cmax and AUC from Day 7 to Day 8. These decreases, in the absence of any 
increase in parent drug, do not suggest in-vivo inhibition of CYP2D6 by oritavancin.

The applicant concluded that oritavancin: 
Is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 
o 
o  May be a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19 
o 
o 
Is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9

There was an increase of 18% in CYP1A2 activity, an increase of 16% in NAT-2 activity and an increase 
of 6% in XO activity by oritavancin. 
Although there were some statistically significant changes in enzyme activities on co-administration of 
probe substrates with oritavancin the point estimates were all < 1.25 and the upper 90% CI did not 
exceed 2.00, indicating that oritavancin had a weak inhibitory or inducing effect. The only interaction 
potential examined considered by the applicant to possibly require action was for warfarin.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Oritavancin is claimed to exhibit three known mechanisms of action as summarised in the diagram.  
Figure 7 
Oritavancin exists primarily as non-covalent dimers that associate strongly with the peptidoglycan 
precursor-membrane target including those in which the peptidoglycan precursors terminate in 
acyl-D-Ala-D-Lac. In solution, oritavancin is 12,800-fold more strongly dimerised than vancomycin, 
which facilitates cooperative binding interactions at the target site. In turn these strengthen the 
attachment of oritavancin to the cell wall and cell wall precursors, enhancing inhibition of peptidoglycan 
biosynthesis and cell wall elongation. Consequently, addition of a 284,000-fold molar excess of 
exogenous peptide ligand N,N’-diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala was needed to block oritavancin antibacterial 
activity. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology

With addition of polysorbate-80 oritavancin MICs against S. aureus ATCC 29213 and E. faecalis ATCC 
29212 decrease by 32- and 16-fold, respectively. These MIC shifts are consistent with the differential 
recovery of oritavancin in the presence and absence of polysorbate-80 and support the idea that the 
in-vitro activity of oritavancin is best represented with polysorbate-80 at 0.002% during all steps of the 
broth microdilution assay, as recommended by CLSI. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
breakpoints established by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are 
as follows:

In-vitro activity against the target pathogens 
Against S. aureus MICs were from ≤ 0.008 - 0.5 µg/mL and the MIC90 was 0.06 µg/mL. Oritavancin was 
active against daptomycin- and linezolid-non-susceptible isolates of S. aureus but the MIC90 was 8- to 
32-fold higher against hVISA, VRSA and VISA (MIC90 0.5 to 2 μg/mL). 
Table 16 
The sub-study of clonal diversity by spa typing of 1100 isolates of S. aureus obtained in SOLO I and SOLO 
II indicated that nearly all the major clonal complexes associated with human S. aureus infections were 
represented. However, it should be noted that CC239 and CC80 were only represented by 2 isolates. 
o  Against S. pyogenes MICs ranged from ≤0.008 to 0.5 µg/mL and MIC90 values were 0.12 or 0.25 
μg/mL. Against S. agalactiae MICs ranged from ≤0.008 to 0.5 µg/mL and MIC90 values were 0.06 or 
0.12 μg/mL.  
o  Against 148 recent isolates of  the  S.  anginosus  Group (S. anginosus  102;  S.  constellatus  33;  S. 
intermedius 13) the MIC range was from ≤0.008 to 0.12 μg/mL and the MIC50/MIC90 values were 
≤0.008/0.0015 μg/mL.

o  Oritavancin  MICs  for  34  S.  dysgalactiae  isolates  ranged  from  ≤0.008  to  0.25  μg/mL,  with 
MIC50/MIC90 values of 0.06/0.25 μg/mL.  
o  For Groups C, G and F streptococci in the US and Europe the MIC90 was 0.25 μg/mL regardless of 
geography or erythromycin susceptibility phenotype. 
o  The significance of E. faecalis in ABSSSI is dubious. Nevertheless, the MIC range was from ≤0.008 to 
1 µg/mL with MIC90 of 0.06 or 0.12 μg/mL. The MIC90 against E. faecalis with the VanA phenotype 
(MIC90 = 0.5 μg/mL) was 8-fold higher compared to vancomycin-susceptible isolates. 
Table 17 
Against linezolid- and daptomycin-non-susceptible E. faecalis isolates the MICs were ≤ 0.5 µg/mL.

Oritavancin  was  active  against  vancomycin-resistant  E.  faecium  (due  to  VanA  and  VanB)  and  other 
enterococci isolated in the US, Europe and Canada.

Table 19 
The MBC90:MIC90 or MBC:MIC ratios against S. aureus ranged from 1 to 2. There were higher MBC:MIC 
ratios for oritavancin against enterococci, which was suggestive of tolerance. 
In time-kill studies there was rapid, concentration-dependent, bactericidal activity against S. aureus 
(including MSSA and MRSA [including mecC MRSA]), S. pyogenes, E. faecalis and E. faecium. An example 
is shown below for CA-MRSA. Note that the fCmax after a single 1200 mg dose is ~16 µg/mL. 
Figure 8 
Oritavancin retained concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against stationary-phase S. aureus, 
including MSSA, MRSA and VRSA. It was also found to sterilise biofilms derived from MSSA, MRSA, VRSA, 
S. epidermidis and Enterococcus at minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) between 0.5-8 
µg/mL. 
Resistance to oritavancin  
Intrinsic resistance to oritavancin occurs in all Gram-negative organisms and in the Gram-positive 
organisms of the genera Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Erysipelothrix and Pediococcus due to alterations in 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 45/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lipid II and in peptidoglycan precursors containing acyl-D-Ala-D-Lac or acyl-D-Ala-D-Ser in place of 
acyl-D-Ala-D-Ala. 
Acquired resistance potentially results from altered peptidoglycan precursor formation with diminished 
affinity for glycopeptides (mediated by the various Van operons in enterococci and VRSA) and changes in 
cell wall structure and thickness leading to reduced glycopeptide binding (as found in hVISA and VISA). 
Based on the proposed breakpoint (0.12 μg/mL) these organisms are not expected to be susceptible to 
oritavancin, with perhaps a few exceptions (see the clinical data for hVISA). 
In-vivo efficacy in non-clinical models 
Efficacy of oritavancin has been studied in: 
- 
- 
- 
Murine septicaemia, (neutropenic) thigh infection, inhalational anthrax and lung infection models 
Rat granuloma pouch and bacteraemia models 
Rabbit endocarditis and meningitis models 
The AUC/MIC ratio and Cmax were identified as the major PK/PD parameters predictive of efficacy.  
An expanded study using 14 S. aureus and five S. pyogenes simulated the concentration-time profile and 
AUC achieved in patients after a 1200 mg dose. This showed more rapid and sustained bacterial killing 
compared with daily regimens, including 400 mg QD for 3 days. An example shows S. aureus. 
Figure 9 
Other microbiological issues 
o  Oritavancin  was  shown  to  have  synergistic  bactericidal  activity  in  combination  with  gentamicin, 
moxifloxacin or rifampicin against MSSA. It also showed synergy with gentamicin or linezolid against 
MRSA-hVISA, VISA and VRSA. With rifampicin there was synergy against VRSA. 
o  At its predicted free peak concentration in plasma oritavancin demonstrated PAEs of 1.5 to 4.5 h 
to  5  h  against  enterococci.  The  oritavancin  PAE  was 
against  S.  aureus  and  3 
concentration-dependent.  
o  Oritavancin  is  a  cationic  amphiphatic  agent  that  accumulates  in  lysosomes  of  macrophages  and 
fibroblasts by 150- to 974-fold over the extracellular drug concentration within 24 h. This ability to 
accumulate has been ascribed to the lipophilic side chain and the 4-epi-vancosamine sugar. 
Effects on cardiac conduction 
Non-clinical studies demonstrated that oritavancin blocked human cardiac INa with an IC50 of 0.5 µM in 
human atrial myocytes and this was confirmed in a mouse cardiac cell line (AT-1 sub-clone). At free drug 
therapeutic levels a near complete block of human INa could be expected, similar to that exerted by Class 
1 anti-arrhythmic agents, associated with prolonged QRS complex (which can lead to arrhythmias).

Concurrent blocking of the Ito channel with IC50 4.2 µM could possibly antagonise the effect on sodium 
channels. Thus, assessing effects on QTc due to the effect on hERG is only a part of the necessary 
evaluation.  
Four studies assessed the effects of oritavancin on cardiac conduction. However, due to the change in 
regimen over time, the relevant data come from MDCO-ORI-12-02, designed as a TQT study in which 
randomisation was to: 
  Oritavancin 1600 mg in 1500 mL of D5W infused over 3 h  
 
  Moxifloxacin (single 400 mg oral dose)   
Placebo - D5W administered as for oritavancin 
The primary endpoint (placebo-adjusted change from baseline in QTcF [i.e. ΔΔQTcF]) was analysed using 
a linear mixed-effect model to evaluate differences between each dose of oritavancin and placebo and 
between moxifloxacin and placebo. Analysis for QTcB was conducted in the same manner. 
For the 150 enrolled the mean age was 34.9 years and 53.7% were male. Adequate assay sensitivity was 
demonstrated in the pre-specified mixed-effects model of ΔΔQTcF, as the lower bound of the 90% CI 
exceeded 5 ms at 2 of the 3 pre-specified time points in the moxifloxacin group after application of the 
Hochberg procedure (at hours 4 and 6). 
Oritavancin did not increase QTc at an IV dose of 1600 mg over 3 h. During the period of highest 
concentrations of oritavancin, ΔΔQTcF was less than 1.2 msec. After hour 6, positive mean values of 2.6 
ms or lower were observed, and the upper boundary of the 90% 2-sided CI was consistently below 6.9 ms 
in the mixed-effects model.  
The QTcF did not exceed 480 ms at any time point during any treatment. Values > 450 ms occurred in one 
placebo, 2 oritavancin and 5 moxifloxacin subjects. Change of QTcF over Baseline exceeded 30 ms at 2 
time points in the oritavancin group and at no time points in the other groups. Change in QTcF did not 
exceed 60 ms at any time point during any treatment.  
There was no consistent or clinically significant change in HR associated with any of the treatments. The 
QRS interval was also not significantly affected by any of the treatments. A modest oritavancin-associated 
prolongation in PR interval was demonstrated (see figure below). The mean placebo-corrected change in

the oritavancin group was statistically significantly positive at time points from hours 3 to 7 with mean 
values 4.6 – 7.7.ms. The oritavancin PR interval (ΔPR) returned to baseline by 10 h, when the plasma 
concentration was ~100 μg/mL. 
Linear PK/PD modelling of the change in PR showed a statistically significant relationship that predicted a 
change in PR of 2.347 ms for a 100 µg/mL change in plasma concentration. 
The mean moxifloxacin plasma concentration at the single time point was 2274 ng/mL with a range from 
1312 to 3693 ng/mL. Following a 3-hour IV infusion of oritavancin, plasma oritavancin concentrations 
peaked at approximately hour 3 (at the termination of the IV infusion). The mean Cmax was 231.67 
μg/mL and the mean AUC0-24 was 2420.65 μg·hr/mL. All PK parameters were estimated with low 
variability (CV% <20%). The linear regression for change in QTc vs. plasma concentration is shown in the 
figure. The linear slope of the regression was slightly negative and statistically significant. 
Figure 10 
The applicant’s conclusions were as follows: 
o  Oritavancin 1600 mg infused over 3 h gave a mean Cmax (at end of infusion) 231.67  μg/mL and 
mean AUC0-24 2420.65 μg·hr/mL. 
o  There  was  no  increase  in  QTc  with  this  dose.  In  addition,  there  was  no  consistent  or  clinically 
significant change in HR or QRS interval. 
o  A modest oritavancin-associated prolongation in PR interval was demonstrated.

Dose selection  
Non-clinical data and PK/PD modeling suggested that efficacy would be optimised by pooling rather than 
fractionating the cumulative dose. The rationale for 1200 mg over 3 h may be summarised as follows: 
o  Bactericidal activity in vitro is concentration-dependent  
o  Cmax and AUC are the main PK parameters that predict efficacy in vivo  
o 
In animal models front-loaded doses achieved effective exposures earlier in therapy when bacterial 
burden was greatest when compared to smaller and more frequent doses 
o  Bacterial regrowth is inhibited after drug concentrations fall below the MIC for the infecting strain 
o  There is a prolonged tissue residence time and the t1/2 in plasma in patients is ~ 245 h 
o 
In TAR-ORI-SD001 (SIMPLIFI) a single 1200 mg dose had similar efficacy to 200 mg QD  
PK/PD analyses 
ICPD 00247-02 describes the PK/PD analyses that concern the 1200 mg single dose based on the POPPK 
relevant to this dose using data collected from the patients enrolled into SOLO I and II. The analysis 
focussed on the microbiologically-evaluable (ME) population as well as the subset with S. aureus isolated 
at baseline. Data from patients for whom the primary outcome was determined to be failure not due to 
study drug were excluded from the analyses. A total of 175 patients treated with oritavancin in SOLO I 
(n=53) and SOLO II (n=122) were in the ME population and had sufficient PK data. Of these, 154 patients 
(50 and 104) had S. aureus isolated at baseline. There was a broad distribution of AUC0-72:MIC ratios.  
Table 20 
Results for univariable PK-PD analyses generally demonstrated that achieving a higher AUC0-72:MIC ratio 
was associated with improved response. However, the high success rates for the efficacy endpoints 
evaluated hindered characterisation of the univariable PK-PD relationships so that continuous functions 
could not be reliably identified. Instead, step functions describing PK-PD relationships which distinguished 
patients with lower vs. higher AUC0-72:MIC ratios and success rates could be detected.

An AUC0-72:MIC ratio threshold of 11,982 was found to distinguish clinical responders from clinical 
non-responders at PTE based on data from all patients and patients with S. aureus.  
Table 21 
The final models for clinical response at PTE based on data from all patients and patients with S. aureus 
contained AUC0-72:MIC ratio evaluated as a two-group variable (p ≤ 0.033) and BMI evaluated as a 
three-group variable (p ≤ 0.01). Univariable relationships between the probability of clinical success at 
PTE and BMI evaluated as a three-group variable based on data from all patients and patients with S. 
aureus resembled an inverted U-shape.  
Tables 23 & 24 
Based on data for all patients, percentages of clinical success were 94.7, 100 and 87.8% for BMI < 25.0, 
≥ 25.0 to < 28.7 and ≥ 28.7 kg/m2, respectively. Based on data from patients with S. aureus, 
percentages of clinical success were 93.7, 100 and 86.8% for BMI < 24.8, ≥ 24.8 to < 29.1, and ≥ 29.1 
kg/m2, respectively. As assessed by the degree of agreement between the model-predicted and observed 
percentages of response the data were well fit by the final models.  
PTA and mean percent probabilities of clinical success by oritavancin MIC are shown in the table below.

For S. pyogenes PTA based on non-clinical targets for stasis and 1-log kill were evaluated since there were 
insufficient data from SOLO I and II to evaluate clinical PK-PD relationships. Percent probabilities of PK-PD 
target attainment were 100% up to MIC values of 0.5 mg/L so the overall percent probability of PK-PD 
target attainment across the MIC distribution was 100% for both AUC0-72:MIC ratio targets. 
Table 25 
The report concluded that: 
Results of univariable analyses based on data from SOLO I and II demonstrated statistically significant 
PK-PD relationships for a number of efficacy endpoints, including clinical response at PTE. However, the 
limited number of failures made it difficult to fully characterise the shape of the function for PK-PD 
relationships.  
The majority of all patients and patients with S. aureus achieved the AUC0-72:MIC ratio threshold of 
11,982 for the univariable relationship for clinical response at PTE. Relatively higher percentages of 
successful responses were observed for those with higher vs. lower AUC0-72:MIC ratios (96.0 vs. 84.6% 
for all patients; 96.2 vs. 82.6% for patients with S. aureus). On the basis of these findings the analyses 
provide support for the single 1200 mg oritavancin dose regimen that was studied in SOLO I and II.  
Results of PK-PD target attainment and model-predicted clinical response analyses based on non-clinical 
and clinical PK-PD data provide support for establishing in-vitro interpretive criteria for oritavancin 
against S. aureus and S. pyogenes.  
The PK-PD target attainment and model-predicted clinical response analyses based on non-clinical and 
clinical PK-PD data evaluated in the context of the MIC distribution for oritavancin against S. aureus and 
S. pyogenes provided further support for the single 1200 mg dose regimen.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Non-clinical and clinical data suggest that elimination of oritavancin occurs slowly mostly via the bile into 
the faeces and to a minor extent via urine. Healthy volunteers were followed for up to 2 months, at which 
time oritavancin was still detectable in plasma with evidence of slow declining concentrations. Incubation 
with human liver microsomes did not detect any depletion of oritavancin due to metabolism and 
non-clinical studies of radiolabelled oritavancin did not point to metabolism in several species.  
On the basis of the available information it is agreed that oritavancin is not likely to be involved in 
clinically significant DDIs with the exception of warfarin, which is mentioned in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the 
SmPC. This is due to the effects on S-warfarin resulting from inhibition of CYP2C9. There is also a quite 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 51/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
separate issue for use of warfarin and other anticoagulants for which in-vitro monitoring (using PT or 
aPTT) is necessary since oritavancin interferes with these tests. Additional information on the duration of 
interference after a single 1200 mg dose was provided during the procedure and is reflected in the SmPC. 
The applicant plans additional in-vitro and in-vivo studies to evaluate these issues. 
The potential for oritavancin to inhibit or induce CYP2C8 was not evaluated. The applicant will conduct 
these studies as a PAM. 
The dossier includes relatively recent data on the in-vitro activity (using the CLSI-recommended 
methodology) of oritavancin against geographically diverse clinical isolates. In the case of oritavancin the 
main interest has to be its activity against staphylococci, especially those that show any degree of 
reduced susceptibility to other glyco(lipo)peptides, and against the beta-haemolytic streptococci.  Taking 
into account the documented mechanisms of action as well as the applicant’s own proposals for the 
susceptibility test breakpoints applicable to a single 1200 mg dose regimen (≤0.12 mg/L for S. aureus) 
oritavancin is expected to be clinically active against glycopeptide-susceptible MRSA but not against 
hVISA, VISA or VRSA, although a very few strains may be susceptible.   
Oritavancin is also not expected to be clinically active against the majority of daptomycin-insusceptible 
staphylococci. An association between reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and to daptomycin has been 
reported in the literature although a correlation is not always observed for individual isolates. Most 
linezolid-insusceptible strains are likely to be susceptible to oritavancin.  
No information was provided on the potential for inhibition of drug transporters other than P-gp. Although 
the applicant considered that oritavancin is unlikely to interact with other transporters it was agreed that 
studies will be conducted in compliance with CHMP guidance.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
o  To conduct an in-vitro study to assess the ability of oritavancin to inhibit or induce CYP2C8.  
o  To conduct transporter studies to meet current guidelines. The selection of transporters to be studied 
will  be  based  upon  the  recent  EMA  and  FDA  guidance  and  the  latest  recommendations  by  the 
International Transporter Consortium. 
o  To conduct and complete the following:

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This section focuses on the three studies in which the 1200 mg single dose was used to treat ABSSSI. 
These included a dose finding study and two Phase 3 studies as follows:  
Table 26 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
TAR-ORI-SD001; SIMPLIFI  
This randomised double-blind study was conducted in 2007-2008 at 43 sites across 5 countries. Patients 
with ABSSSI were eligible if they met the protocol-defined criteria for each of severity, complicated 
disease and disease categories (wound infections at the site of surgical incision or trauma, cellulitis or 
major abscess).  
Randomisation was to one of (1:1:1): 
  200 mg daily for 3-7 days (the prior proposed regimen) 
  1200 mg single dose (the current proposed regimen) 
  800 mg day 1 and 400 mg on day 5 if considered necessary (an alternative exploratory regimen) 
A maximum infusion rate of approximately 9 mg/min was selected to minimise the incidence of potential 
HLIRs. Thus, dosing employed infusions of 200 mg in 250 ml over 45-60 min or sequential 
administrations of 400 mg, each in 250 ml over 45-60 min (1200 mg was given over 2 h 15 min to 3 h).  
Patients requiring further therapy after Day 7 were considered clinical failures. 
The primary analysis was based on investigator-determined clinical outcomes (IDCO) at first follow-up 
(day 21) in CE patients Assuming a response rate of 85% and a 2-sided 90% (note, not 95%) confidence 
interval around the difference between groups in response rates it was estimated that 70 CE patients per 
arm would yield nearly 80% power to declare non-inferiority to within 15%.  Assuming a clinical 
evaluability rate of 70%, 300 (100 per treatment group) were to be enrolled. Overall 302 patients (210 
USA) received study medication, including 199 males and 103 females with a mean age of 45 years.

Table 27 
There was a disproportion between the percentage of patients who discontinued early in the daily dose 
group (22% [22/78]) compared to single (10.1% [10/89]) and infrequent (9.7% [10/93]) dose groups. 
The reasons patients were excluded from the CE population included not meeting enrolment criteria, 
receiving < 80% of intended study medication, having an indeterminate investigator-determined clinical 
outcome (IDCO) at EOT or first follow-up or not having a first follow-up (TOC) assessment.  
The primary analysis indicated that a single dose of 1200 mg or 800 mg with an optional 400 mg dose on 
Day 5 was non-inferior to 200 mg for 3 to 7 days. Note the comparisons show 90% CI and not 95% CI.  
Table 28 
The results in the other patient populations supported the conclusions of the primary analysis. In the table 
below the numbers and percentages do not reflect the total ITT per group because those with missing and 
indeterminate outcomes have been excluded. A further ITT analysis in which these cases were counted as 
failures gave cure rates of 63/98 (64.3%), 72/99 (72.7%) and 68/103 (66%) in respective dose groups.

Table 29 
For CE patients the first follow-up response rates were lowest for wound infections and highest for major 
abscesses. Cure rates were comparable between treatment groups for major abscesses.  
Table 30 
In addition cure rates for wound infection were 64.5%, 65.5% and 75.0% in the ITT, 63.0%, 68.2% and 
78.9% in the MITT and 65.2%, 68.2% and 75.0% in the ME populations for the daily dose, single dose 
and infrequent dose, respectively. A single dose or infrequent dosing appeared to be better for cellulitis 
and there were statistically significant differences in the CE (90% CI; 9.2, 49.1) and ITT (90% CI = 8.1, 
45.7) populations between the single dose group and daily dose group. IDCO at first follow-up in the CE 
population by patient sub-groups are difficult to interpret due to low denominators and no conclusions can 
be drawn.

Table 31 
At the late follow-up visit relapse occurred in three patients. One occurred in a patient in the single dose 
group who suffered a wound infection while the other two occurred in patients in the infrequent dose 
group - one with wound infection and one with cellulitis. 
Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated pathogen (in 183 [87.6%] of the 209 MITT 
patients) and 103/183 were MRSA. In the ME population the IDCO-assigned by-pathogen cure rates for 
MRSA were 78.3% (18/23), 73.0% (27/37) and 87.0% (20/23) in the daily dose, single dose and 
infrequent dose groups, respectively. Similar results applied in the MITT population as shown below. 
Table 32 
There was no obvious relationship between oritavancin MIC and rate of cure at first follow-up in the ME 
population, including S. aureus and MRSA. However, there were only 4 S. aureus in the ME population and 
5 in the MITT population with oritavancin MICs > 0.12 mg/l. Two S. aureus had vancomycin MICs > 1 
mg/L (both 2 mg/L) at baseline. Six patients had baseline isolates that showed an increase in oritavancin 
MIC from baseline (5 with S. aureus and one with S. intermedius). Three failed at first follow-up, two were 
improved and one was cured. In no case did the final MIC exceed 0.25 mg/l.  
The patient-level success rates in the MITT and ME populations showed a trend to a higher response rate 
with infrequent dosing. No super-infections were observed.

Similarly,  the  patient-level  cure  rates  according  to  baseline  pathogen  followed  the  pattern  in  the  CE 
population since most outcomes were based on the clinical response.

Methods 
These double-blind studies of identical design were initiated in January 2011. SOLO II completed about 6 
months after SOLO I. The geographical locations of sites differed between the two as follows: 
o  SOLO I was conducted at 46 sites across 9 countries and included 23 sites in the US. 
o  SOLO II was conducted at 32 sites across 10 countries and included 11 sites in the US 
o  Both studies included at least one site in India, Israel, Mexico, Romania, Russia, Spain and Ukraine. 
SOLO I also had a site in Germany while SOLO II had one site in each of Canada and Argentina.

The studies were conducted at a time when new US FDA guidance on studies in ABSSSI had been issued 
recommending a primary analysis based on early (on-treatment) endpoints as described below whereas 
the EU guidance continued to request a primary analysis based on the clinical outcome at an appropriate 
post-therapy test of cure (TOC) visit. However, during this same period the EMA and FDA agreed that the 
same studies could be used to support applications in each of the US and EU provided that two statistical 
analyses plans were developed. The applicant followed this strategy as explained below. 
The general design features are shown in the figure.

Treatments 
Oritavancin was given on Day 1 as a single 1200 mg dose in 1000 mL of 5% D5W over 3 h. Vancomycin 
was administered IV for 7 to 10 days. The first dose on Day 1 was administered as 1 g or 15 mg/kg in 
1000 mL D5W over 3 h and then as 1 g or 15 mg/kg q12h in volumes and diluents selected for the 
individual patient infused over at least 60 min. Subsequent doses could be adjusted by the unblinded 
pharmacist based on CrCl levels, clinical status or vancomycin trough levels. Aztreonam and 
metronidazole were allowed for patients with mixed infections. 
Objectives 
The primary objective as stated in the protocol was to establish non-inferiority of oritavancin vs. 
vancomycin based on the primary efficacy outcome of cessation of spread or reduction in size of the 
baseline lesion, absence of fever and no rescue medication at Early Clinical Evaluation (ECE; 48 to 72 h 
after start of study treatment) in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population. 
The critical secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical response vs. vancomycin at End of Therapy 
(EOT) and sustained to Day 10 and the post therapy evaluation (PTE) in the MITT and CE populations. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint as stated in the protocol was early clinical response at the ECE visit. Early 
clinical response was a composite outcome of the following: 
- 
- 
- 
Cessation of spreading or reduction in the size of baseline lesion 
Absence of fever 
No rescue antibacterial agent given 
A patient was a success if all three components were met and failed if ≥ 1 of the following occurred: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Death (all-cause mortality) during the first 72 h 
Fever defined as at least one oral temperature ≥ 37.7°C between 48 and 72 h 
Spreading of lesion size at 48 to 72 h vs. baseline except that a ≥ 20% reduction in lesion area 
from baseline was not classed as failure even if there was an increase in lesion length or width  
Administration of rescue antibacterial therapy for ABSSSI during the first 72 h 
Additional, unplanned, surgical procedure during the first 72 h 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was investigator-assessed clinical cure at PTE. This was designated 
as the primary endpoint for the EMA. This endpoint was pre-specified for non-inferiority testing with a 
margin of 10% in the MITT and CE populations. 
There were two main secondary efficacy endpoints: 
i) 
Lesion size reduction ≥ 20% from baseline at ECE. This is the endpoint currently recommended 
by FDA and NIH  for an ABSSSI treatment. This endpoint was pre-specified for non-inferiority 
testing with a margin of 10% using the MITT and CE populations. 
Sustained clinical response at PTE i.e. EOT cure that is sustained over time. This endpoint was not 
pre-specified for non-inferiority testing. 
ii) 
There were four visits during the follow-up period: 
1. 
2. 
An EOT visit within 24 h of last administration of study drug or change to non-study drug 
A Day 10 visit at 10 days from initiation of the first dose of study drug, which in some patients was 
the same as the EOT visit 
A PTE visit at 7 to 14 days from the EOT visit 
A safety follow-up visit at 60 days after the first dose of study drug 
3. 
4. 
Each investigational site’s laboratory cultured specimens (aerobic and where possible, anaerobic) and 
identified any pathogen(s). All pathogens obtained from the infection site were sub-cultured and sent to 
the Central Laboratory for identification to the species level. MICs were determined using broth 
microdilution by the Central Laboratory. S. aureus strains were screened for the Panton-Valentine 
Leukocidin (pvl) by polymerase chain reaction. A subset of S. aureus strains (those with vancomycin MICs

of 1 or 2 μg/mL) was screened for the hVISA phenotype with glycopeptide resistance detection (GRD) 
Etest strips (bioMerieux). 
Sample size 
For the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e. the FDA-recommended endpoint) the response rates in both 
treatment groups in the MITT population were assumed to be 75%. A sample size of approximately 960 
patients (480 per treatment group) would provide at least 90% power to reject the null hypothesis at the 
1-sided alpha level of 0.025. This sample size also provides at least 90% power to demonstrate 
non-inferiority for the clinical cure at PTE assessment of efficacy at the 1-sided alpha level of 0.025, 
assuming a clinical cure event rate of 65% in the MITT population in both treatment groups. Patient 
enrolment was to continue until approximately 175 patients were confirmed with MRSA as a baseline 
pathogen. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified by geographic region (North America, South America, Eastern Europe, 
Western Europe, and Asia), study site and diabetes mellitus diagnosis. An enrolment cap of 30% was 
maintained for major cutaneous abscesses. 
Blinding (masking) 
The studies were double-blind. 
Statistical methods 
The following patient populations were used for the efficacy analyses:

Unless otherwise specified, missing data was not imputed and was excluded from analysis. 
For the EU primary analysis patients with assessments outside the visit window had their responses at 
PTE imputed as follows: 
- If a patient had clinical failure assessed beyond the PTE visit window, the patient was considered 
as a clinical failure at PTE 
- If a patient had clinical success assessed beyond the PTE visit window: 
*The patient was a clinical failure at PTE if he/she had failed before the PTE visit 
*The patient was a clinical success at PTE if he/she was a clinical success before the PTE visit 
After imputation, patients who still had a missing assessment at PTE were treated as failures.

Results 
SOLO I 
Participant flow 
There were 954 treated patients (MITT population). Two patients randomised to oritavancin were 
inadvertently dosed with vancomycin. The majority (oritavancin 88.6% and vancomycin 83.9%) 
completed treatment for 7 to 10 days and around 90% completed to the Day 60 safety visit. There were 
no major protocol violations or deviations from the study eligibility criteria that affected the results. 
Table 35 
Conduct of the study 
There were 2 amendments after starting enrolment. The only important change was made in Amendment 
1, which removed mandatory 72 h hospitalisation, so allowing an outpatient assessment of ECE. 
Baseline data 
Most patients were enrolled in North America (62.7%) and Asia (31.0%) and were predominantly white 
and male. There was no difference in baseline disease or primary infection site characteristics between 
the treatment groups. Half of the patients had cellulitis/erysipelas, nearly 30% had a major cutaneous 
abscess and 15% met the SIRS criteria. The median infection area at baseline was 248.0 cm2 for the 
oritavancin group and 225.6 cm2 for the vancomycin group.  
In the MITT population S. aureus was the most common (MRSA in 204 and MSSA in 230 patients) while 
S. pyogenes was found in 3.3%. For these species MICs of oritavancin were ≤ 0.25 mg/L and mostly did 
not exceed 0.06 mg/L. MICs of vancomycin did not exceed 1 mg/L for S. aureus (in the vancomycin group 
14 MRSA and 17 MSSA had MICs = 1 mg/L) or 0.25 mg/L for S. pyogenes. There were 18 oritavancin and 
9 vancomycin patients with bacteraemia.

Most patients (98.7%) in the oritavancin group received a full dose of 1200 mg on Day 1 and 88.6% 
completed the twice daily placebo infusions for 7 to 10 days. Slightly fewer (83.9%) in the vancomycin 
group completed 7 to 10 days of therapy. Less than 10% received aztreonam and/or metronidazole.

Outcomes and estimation 
Most patients (98.7%) in the oritavancin group received a full dose of 1200 mg on Day 1 and 88.6% 
completed the twice daily placebo infusions for 7 to 10 days. Slightly fewer (83.9%) in the vancomycin 
group completed 7 to 10 days of therapy. Less than 10% received aztreonam and/or metronidazole. 
The non-inferiority margin for the primary efficacy analysis of early clinical response was met.  
Table 37 
The results in the ITT and CE populations were consistent: 
ITT - oritavancin 78.3%; vancomycin 79.0%; difference: -0.7% (95% CI: -5.9, 4.5) 
CE - oritavancin 91.9%; vancomycin 93.2%; difference -1.3% (95% CI: -5.0, 2.3)  
Investigator-assessed clinical outcome at PTE was missing for 55 oritavancin and 61 vancomycin 
patients. When patients with missing values were entirely excluded from the analysis the cure rates were 
90.0% vs. 91.6% and when they were counted as successes the rates were 91.2% vs. 92.7%.  
Percentages with an early clinical response but without cure at PTE were 14.8% for oritavancin and 11.9% 
for vancomycin. The most frequent reason was the use of non-study antibacterial agents before or at PTE 
and worsening of erythema/induration or purulent drainage before or at PTE. 
A sustained clinical response at PTE was observed for 65.9% oritavancin and 67.2% vancomycin MITT 
patients (difference -1.3%; 95% CI -7.3, 4.7). Failure was reported for 25.3% and 25.1% while data 
were missing for 8.8% and 7.7%. If missing values were excluded the rates were 72.3% vs. 72.9% and 
if they were treated as success the rates were 74.7% vs. 74.9%.

Percentages of patients with microbiological success at PTE were based on the clinical response and 
therefore were similar between treatments.  
Table 38 
The microbiological success rates were comparable between treatment groups by type of infection. 
Similar results were seen with the MicroE population. In the patients with bacteraemia the patient-level 
microbiological success rates at PTE were oritavancin 10/15 and vancomycin 3/7 while rates for those 
with ABSSSI pathogens in blood were 6/9 and 1/3. For patients with MRSA or with MSSA the cure rates 
at PTE were comparable between treatments in both population subsets with pathogens. 
Table 39 
In the MicroITT population 291/407 (71.5%) of baseline S. aureus screened were positive for the pvl gene 
(100/208 of MSSA and 191/199 of MRSA). The presence of pvl had no impact on MICs but there was a 
noticeable impact on the rates of early clinical response in the oritavancin and vancomycin groups. In 
contrast the IDCO cure rates at PTE by pvl status did not demonstrate such an effect in the MicroITT or ME 
populations.

Table 40 
Among the 52 isolates of S. aureus screened for the hVISA phenotype by GRD methodology due to having 
a vancomycin MIC of 1 μg/mL 12 (23.1%) were GRD positive. All the patients with hVISA had an early 
clinical response. In addition, hVISA did not impact on cure rates at PTE. 
Eradication rates (presumed from clinical cure rates) for MRSA are shown as an example below. The 
pathogen-level microbiological responses generally were not impacted by oritavancin MIC. 
Table 41 
A consistent treatment effect was seen for early clinical response and investigator-assessed clinical cure 
by sex, age, race, geographic region and diabetes mellitus. Consistent effects were also seen by disease 
category and in the sub-group with SIRS. 
SOLO II 
Participant flow 
There were 1005 treated patients (MITT population). The majority (oritavancin 90.3% and vancomycin 
88.8%) completed treatment for 7 to 10 days and around 90% completed to the Day 60 safety visit. 
There were no major protocol violations or deviations from the study eligibility criteria that affected the 
safety or efficacy results.

Table 42 
Conduct of the study 
The same amendments applied as in SOLO I. There were no major protocol violations or deviations from 
the study eligibility criteria that affected the safety or efficacy results. 
Baseline data 
Most patients were enrolled in North America (56.9%) and Asia (23.6%) and were predominantly white 
and male. There was no difference in baseline disease or primary infection site characteristics between 
the treatment groups. In contrast to SOLO I about one-third of patients had each of the three major 
diagnoses and the median infection area at baseline was slightly higher in SOLO II. Fewer patients in 
SOLO II had diabetes but slightly more met the SIRS criteria.  
S. aureus was the most common pathogen but a higher proportion were MSSA in SOLO II vs. SOLO I.  
Also, there was a slightly higher rate of S. pyogenes (8.1% and 7.1% per group). MICs of oritavancin did 
not exceed 0.25 mg/L for these species. MICs of vancomycin were ≤ 1 mg/L but 8 MRSA and 18 MSSA 
treated with vancomycin had MICs = 1 mg/L. There were 10 oritavancin and 10 vancomycin patients with 
bacteraemia.   
Most patients (93.8%) in the oritavancin group received a full dose of 1200 mg on Day 1 and 90.3% 
completed the twice daily placebo infusions for 7 to 10 days. Slightly fewer (88.8%) completed 7 to 10 
days of vancomycin. Aztreonam was given to ~8% per group and metronidazole to 6.4% and 4.4%.

The percentages in each of the analysis populations were comparable between the treatment groups. 
Table 43 
Outcomes and estimation 
The non-inferiority margin for the primary efficacy analysis of early clinical response was met.  
Table 44 
The percentages who failed and reasons for treatment failure were similar between groups. The baseline 
lesion area was similar between treatment groups for patients with and without an early clinical response.  
When early clinical response was calculated using the composite endpoint (cessation of spread or 
reduction in size and no rescue medication) 90.1% and 89.4% in the oritavancin and vancomycin groups, 
respectively, had an early clinical response. Early clinical response rates in the ITT and CE populations 
gave consistent results. 
In the primary analysis for the EU non-inferiority was demonstrated.  
Table 45 
The percentages assessed as treatment failures by investigators were similar in the oritavancin (7.4%) 
and vancomycin (7.6%) groups. In addition, 9.9% and 12.0% in respective groups had a missing

CE populations were consistent: 
ITT - oritavancin 81.7%; vancomycin 79.2%; difference: 2.5% (95% CI: -2.4, 7.4) 
CE - oritavancin 93.2%; vancomycin 94.9%; difference -1.6% (95% CI: -4.9, 1.6)  
Investigator-assessed  clinical  outcome  at  PTE  was  missing  for  50  oritavancin  and  60  vancomycin 
patients. When patients with missing values were entirely excluded from the analysis the cure rates were 
91.8% vs. 91.4% and when they were counted as successes the rates were 92.6% vs. 92.4%.  
Percentages with an early clinical response but without cure at PTE were 12.2% for oritavancin and 13.5% 
for vancomycin. The most frequent reason was worsening of erythema/induration or purulent drainage 
before or at PTE and the use of non-study antibacterial agents before or at PTE. 
A sustained clinical response at PTE was observed for 74.4% oritavancin and 73.7% vancomycin patients 
(difference -0.6%; 95% CI -4.8, 6.1). Failure was reported for 18.1% and 15.7% while data were missing 
for 7.6% and 10.6%. If missing values were excluded the rates were 80.4% vs. 82.4% and if they were 
treated as success the rates were 81.9% vs. 84.3%. 
Percentages with microbiological success at PTE were similar between treatments.  
Table 46 
The microbiological success rates were comparable between treatment groups by type of infection. 
Similar results were seen with the MicroE population. In the MicroITT population the patient-level 
microbiological success rates at PTE were 4/8 and 9/9 and for pathogens known to cause ABSSSI the 
rates were 1/3 and 3/3, respectively. For patients with MRSA or MSSA the cure rates at PTE were 
comparable between treatments in both populations.

In the MicroITT population 281/508 (55.3%) of baseline S. aureus screened were positive for the pvl gene 
(100/307 MSSA and 181/201 MRSA). The presence of pvl had no impact on MICs and only a modest 
negative effect on early clinical response rates in the oritavancin and vancomycin groups. The IDCO cure 
rates at PTE by pvl status showed no effect or a modest effect.  
Tables 48 & 49 
The early clinical response rates were comparable between treatments for non-hVISA but lower for 
oritavancin among the very few hVISA. In contrast, all patients with hVISA in both treatment groups (2 
and 3 per group) had an investigator-assigned outcome of cure at PTE.  
The eradication rates were very predominantly presumed from the clinical cure rates. The data for MRSA 
are shown as an example below. The pathogen level responses were generally not impacted by MIC.  
Table 50 
A consistent treatment effect was seen for early clinical response and investigator-assessed clinical cure 
by sex, age, race and geographic region and also in the sub-group with SIRS. In the MITT population the 
cure rates at PTE favoured vancomycin in the patients with diabetes mellitus (32/46 [69.6%] for 
oritavancin and 40/45 [88.9%] for vancomycin).

Ancillary analyses – SOLO 1 & SOLO 2 
There were relatively small numbers of some species per study, especially S. pyogenes cases. The tables 
below summarise cure rates by pathogen at PTE in the MicroITT and MicroE populations across SOLO I 
and II. As far as can be discerned, the species-specific rates were similar between treatments.  
Table 51 
Table 52 
The vancomycin trough levels were obtained as a minimum prior to the 4th dose and data were available 
for 433/481 patients in SOLO I and for 465/502 in SOLO II as shown below.

Table 53 
The 2009 IDSA recommendations for trough levels when treating S. aureus state that the concentration 
immediately before the 4th dose should be in the range 15-20 mg/L for the most serious infections and 
should not be below 10 mg/L.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Phase 3 studies were generally designed and analysed in compliance with CHMP guidance. Since the 
differential activity against MSSA and MRSA was a concern with daily dosing in the prior application, 
special attention was paid to enrolling patients with MRSA in the new Phase 3 studies and about half of the 
patients had this pathogen. The low rate of SIRS, as well as very few bacteraemia cases and <5% with 
infections due to S. pyogenes have been encountered in other relatively recent studies in ABSSSI. These 
issues do not preclude acceptance of the data but these and some other limitations (e.g. infections 
studied were confined to cellulitis, abscesses and wound infections only; few elderly patients) should be 
stated in section 4.4 of the SmPC so that prescribers are warned about the extent of the clinical 
experience. 
Vancomycin was the selected comparator. Dosing of this agent was 1 g or 15 mg/kg q12h and was 
adjusted according to local practises by designated unblinded personnel at each study site. The lack of 
standardisation of the approach to dosing and adjustment criteria is not ideal but in a global study with 
feasibility issues and in which cure rates with vancomycin were in the expected range it can be accepted.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Both studies demonstrated non-inferiority for oritavancin vs. vancomycin based on the clinical cure rates 
at PTE in the MITT and CE populations and the sensitivity analyses supported the primary analysis. The 
lower bounds of the 95% CI were well within -10%. In addition, the results at the ECE visit supported a 
conclusion of general comparability between treatment groups. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Two Phase 3 RCTs of an appropriate design support a conclusion that a single 1200 mg dose of oritavancin 
has similar efficacy to twice daily dosing with vancomycin in the treatment of acute bacterial infections of 
the skin and soft tissues due to recognised Gram-positive pathogens that are susceptible to glycopeptides 
and lipoglycopeptides.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The focus is on the safety profile of the 1200 mg single dose administered over 3 h in patients with 
ABSSSI, including SOLO I and II. The tabulations compare the pooled data from the SOLO studies with 
those from Phase 3 daily dosing studies in ABSSSI (ARRD and ARRI) and with the total safety database.  
Patient exposure 
The total safety database consists of 3017 oritavancin-treated individuals in 22 clinical studies (424 
subjects in Phase 1 and 2593 patients in Phase 2/3).  In Phase 2/3 ABSSSI studies with the 1200 mg 
single dose 1075 received oritavancin. In SOLO I and II, 976 patients received oritavancin and 983 
received vancomycin.  
The overall incidence of AEs, deaths, SAEs and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were similar for 
the oritavancin and vancomycin/comparator groups within each of the pools. 
Table 56 
Adverse events 
In the SOLO pool the most common AEs in the oritavancin group were nausea, headache and vomiting. 
The rates for any individual AE in the oritavancin group were ≤ 10% and mostly similar to rates in the 
vancomycin group. A broadly similar pattern applied in the ARRD/I and All Treated pools. 
Table 57 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
Page 74/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Specific analyses of rates of AEs of most interest, including AEs for which reporting rates were higher for 
oritavancin, were conducted using broad and narrow PTs 
Hypersensitivity - The incidence of AEs possibly representing hypersensitivity reactions was lower in the 
oritavancin group (12.1%) than the vancomycin group (18.6%) in the SOLO pool and in the other pools 
(12.6% vs. 21.9% in ARRD/I and 14.7% vs. 18% overall). The most frequent (> 2.0%) individual AEs in 
the SOLO pool were pruritus in the oritavancin group and pruritus and urticaria in the vancomycin group. 
Broadly consistent findings applied in the ARRD/I and All Treated pools.  
The narrow search for AEs that could relate to hypersensitivity in the SOLO pool gave lower rates overall 
and for most individual terms in the oritavancin group. The median time to onset was 1.2 days (0 to 29) 
for oritavancin and 0.4 days (0 to 21) for vancomycin and the median durations were 2.4 days (0 to 45) 
and 1.0 day (0 to 52). These AEs were serious in 0.4% per group while the discontinuation rates were 
0.5% vs. 1.4%. 
Table 58 
Infusion Site Reactions/Phlebitis – When oritavancin 1200 mg was administered in 1000 mL over 3 hours 
in the SOLO studies the incidence of these AEs was similar between the oritavancin (10.1%) and 
vancomycin (11.1%) groups. The median time to onset of these AEs was 3.1 days in each group and the 
median durations of the AEs were comparable (2.0 vs. 1.9 days). None of these AEs was serious and the 
discontinuation rates were 0.5% for oritavancin vs. 0.1% for vancomycin. 
Vestibular Toxicity and ototoxicity – The incidence of vestibular toxicity was similar in the oritavancin 
(2.0%) and vancomycin (2.8%) groups in the SOLO pool and dizziness was the most frequent individual 
AE. The median time to onset was 3.0 days for oritavancin and 1.1 days for vancomycin and the median 
durations were 0.4 (0 to 19) vs. 0.6 (0 to 13) days, respectively. No clinically relevant changes in 
audiograms were observed in the four Phase 1 studies (ARRA, ARRB, ARRK and JE-101N) that included 
audiometric testing before and after oritavancin administration. There was one AE of deafness (reported 
as a mild right ear hearing loss) in SOLO II in a 62-year-old female with onset 12 days after oritavancin 
but this was assessed as unlikely related to study drug.  
Hepatic AEs - In the SOLO pool the overall rates for hepatic AEs (related to liver laboratory abnormalities 
or clinical AEs) were 4.7% in the oritavancin group and 3.0 % in the vancomycin group. The difference

was driven by AEs of increased ALT in 2.8% oritavancin and 1.5% vancomycin patients. The median times 
to onset were 6.9 days vs. 6.8 days in respective groups while the median durations were 8.2 days vs. 9.1 
days. None of these AEs was serious or led to study discontinuation. In the All Treated pool there was one 
death due to a hepatic event (hepatic cirrhosis) in the bacteremia study ARRM. This patient already had 
cirrhosis when she presented with MSSA bacteraemia. She died after completing 9 days of oritavancin 8 
mg/kg due to GI bleeding and encephalopathy. Death was not considered to be related to oritavancin.   
Renal AEs - The incidence of renal AEs was similar in the oritavancin (0.7%) and vancomycin (0.9%) 
groups in the SOLO pool. The median time to onset was 8.2 days (0 to 31) for oritavancin and 6.6 days 
(3 to 22) for vancomycin with median durations of 11.7 and 13.0 days. Renal failure was reported for 3 in 
the oritavancin group and 5 in the vancomycin group (one of the 5 was serious).  
Cardiac and Cardiac Rhythm Disorders - In the SOLO pool cardiac AE rates were 3.4% for oritavancin and 
2.7% for vancomycin, with a higher rate of tachycardia with oritavancin (2.5% vs. 1.1%). Cardiac AEs 
were predominantly within preferred terms of supraventricular arrhythmias but there were no AEs of 
QT/QTc prolongation, AV block or bundle branch block. One patient died in the oritavancin group due to 
electromechanical dissociation considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. Cardiac SAEs 
occurred in 0.3% oritavancin and 0.6% vancomycin patients. In the oritavancin group these were 
ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure and the case of electromechanical dissociation. 
ECG evaluations considered the SOLO pool, the data in the 1200 mg group in SIMPLIFI, the two later TQT 
studies and ECGs from 69 healthy subjects administered daily oritavancin doses ranging from 100 mg to 
800 mg. The results showed that oritavancin had no effect on the QTcF or QRS intervals. 
Infections and Infestations - The rates of all AEs in the infections and infestations SOC in the SOLO pool 
were 16.4% for oritavancin vs. 14.4% for vancomycin. The most frequently reported individual AEs in the 
SOLO pool were cellulitis and abscesses in limbs. There was no excess of fungal or mycobacterial 
infections in the oritavancin group. Consistent findings applied in the ARRD/I and All Treated pools. Rates 
for sepsis, septic shock and related events were low (oritavancin 0.3%; vancomycin 0.7%) with one 
death in each treatment group. The death in the oritavancin group was at 38 days post-dose and followed 
hospitalization for severe multi-lobar pneumonia on the same day.  
Osteomyelitis occurred more often with oritavancin (6 cases) than vancomycin (one case) in the SOLO 
studies (including 5 vs. 0 in SOLO II), a pattern which was already apparent from the prior studies that 
employed daily dosing (13 vs. 0 in ARRD/I). In the SOLO studies the median time to osteomyelitis onset 
was 4.6 days (0 to 9 days) in the oritavancin group while the single vancomycin patient had an onset at 
2.6 days. Four of the 6 cases in the oritavancin group were SAEs, as was the single vancomycin group 
case. Osteomyelitis was suspected by the investigator to be pre-existing in two of these four patients. An 
individual patient review of all osteomyelitis cases did not reveal any common factor to explain the 
imbalance in osteomyelitis between the treatment groups, including diabetes mellitus diagnosis at 
baseline, diabetic foot, peripheral vascular disease, amputation, primary infection site location, baseline 
pathogen and region where the study was conducted. The location of the primary infection site in the 
majority of patients with osteomyelitis in the oritavancin group was the foot and lower leg but no 
pathogens were isolated from the site of osteomyelitis in any of the cases.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were 77 deaths (oritavancin 1.8% [53/3017]; vancomycin/comparator 1.2% [24/1954]) reported 
across all studies. The median time to death was 17 days (2 to 61 days) in the oritavancin group and 19 
days (5 to 48 days) in the vancomycin group and the mean ages of those who died were 58.1 years (19 
to 90 years) and 67.3 years (43 to 93 years) in respective groups.  
In the SOLO pool, 2 in the oritavancin group and 3 in the vancomycin group died. The causes of death 
were sepsis and electromechanical dissociation in the oritavancin group and septic shock, acute 
myocardial infarction and dementia with Parkinsonism in the vancomycin group. None of the deaths was 
considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
The incidence of death was higher in the ARRD/I and the All Treated pools. The higher incidence of death 
in the All Treated pool was driven by the rates in the bacteremia studies. The most frequent AEs leading 
to death in both the oritavancin and vancomycin groups were cardiac arrest in the ARRD/I pool and septic 
shock in the All Treated pool. Three deaths across the clinical development programme were considered 
related to study drug by the investigator. These were deaths due to hypotension and multi-organ failure 
in two patients in the oritavancin group in ARRM and a case of ventricular fibrillation in a vancomycin 
patient in ARRI. 
Serious Adverse Events 
The overall frequency of SAEs was similar in the oritavancin and vancomycin groups in the SOLO pool.  
The most frequent SAEs in the oritavancin group were cellulitis, osteomyelitis, abscess limb, pneumonia, 
skin infection and subcutaneous abscess. The median time to onset of SAEs was 10.6 days (0 to 62 days) 
in the oritavancin group and 19.6 days (0 to 56 days) in the vancomycin group.  
SAEs assessed as related to study drug occurred in 0.5% oritavancin and 0.4% vancomycin patients. 
Related SAEs in the oritavancin group included leucocytoclastic vasculitis, urticaria, mouth ulceration, 
drug hypersensitivity and bronchospasm, each of which was reported by 1 patient. 
The overall frequency of SAEs in both the oritavancin and vancomycin/comparator groups was lower in 
the SOLO pool compared to the ARRD/I and All Treated pools.  
The SAEs concerning reports that could have reflected hypersensitivity reactions did not suggest an 
excess risk associated with oritavancin vs. vancomycin/comparators.

Haematology 
Rates of haematological abnormalities reported as AEs were higher for oritavancin in each pool. The 
differences reflected a range of abnormalities and very small numbers with each.

Table 61 
The AE of pancytopenia occurred in an oritavancin patient in the bacteremia study ARRM. This AE was 
serious but was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to study drug.  
Thrombocytopenia/decreased platelets was reported as an AE in 5 oritavancin group and no vancomycin 
patients in the SOLO studies but none of these cases was serious. There was also a higher rate of these 
AEs for oritavancin vs. comparators in the All Treated pool (12 vs. 2 patients) although none in the 
oritavancin group was serious. 
For each haematology parameter the shifts from normal at baseline to either high or low post-baseline 
were similar in the oritavancin and vancomycin groups in the SOLO pool. The percentages with PCS values 
at any time post baseline (in those without PCS at baseline) were similar in the oritavancin and 
vancomycin groups in the SOLO pool.  
Biochemistry 
For each biochemistry parameter, shifts from normal at baseline to either high or low post-baseline were 
similar in the oritavancin and vancomycin groups in the SOLO pool. In addition, the baseline values for 
each biochemistry parameter, mean change from baseline and percentages with PCS values were similar 
between treatments at each post-randomisation time point. Hepatic effects were evaluated separately 
and in accordance with FDA guidance for the detection of drug-induced liver injury.  
A higher proportion of patients in both treatment groups in the SOLO pool had PCS LFT values when 
compared to the ARRD/ARRI pool or the All Treated Pool. For individual parameters the rates were not 
higher for oritavancin vs. vancomycin except for total bilirubin. Nevertheless, numbers are very small. 
The mean changes from baseline for each LFT parameter were similar between treatments and none of 
these changes was clinically significant.

Table 62 
Of the 24 patients (10 oritavancin;14 vancomycin) with AST or ALT elevations > 5X ULN in the SOLO pool, 
17/24 (8 and 9) returned to baseline levels. For the remaining 7 patients (2 and 5) the AST or ALT values 
either decreased towards baseline levels or the patients were lost to follow up.  
Two outlier analyses evaluated Hy’s law and were reviewed by an external independent hepatologist.  
AST/ALT ≥ 3X ULN, total bilirubin ≥ 2X ULN and ALP < 2X ULN - Five oritavancin and one vancomycin 
patients met these criteria.  
Medical review of these cases confirmed that none met the criteria for Hy’s law due to the lack of evidence 
of hepatocellular injury, sequence of LFT changes and/or relevant medical history.  
eDISH Plot – In the All Treated pool six patients (4 oritavancin; 2 vancomycin) had elevations > 3X ULN 
in ALT and > 2X ULN in total bilirubin. Two oritavancin group and one vancomycin patients were the same 
patients described above who met the criteria for AST/ALT ≥ 3X ULN, total bilirubin ≥ 2X ULN, and ALP < 
2X ULN (TMC-ORI-10-02/291003016 and TMC-ORI-10-01/101005005 from the SOLO studies and 
ARRI-229-0003 from ARRI). The other three cases did not meet the criteria for Hy’s law. 
Safety in special populations 
Age - In the SOLO pool the majority of patients were aged < 65 years. Small percentages were aged 
65 to < 75 years (oritavancin 7.1%; vancomycin 6.2%) or ≥ 75 years (1.7% vs. 1.6%). Similar 
percentages by age groups occurred in the ARRD/I and All Treated pools. In both treatment groups the 
rates for AEs, deaths, SAEs and discontinuations of study drug due to an AE were highest for those aged 
> 75 years. For most individual AEs the rates were comparable between treatments within each age 
subset.

In the oritavancin group in the SOLO pool hypersensitivity was reported by a higher percentage of 
patients aged ≥ 75 years (7/17; 41.2%) compared to those aged < 65 years (11.8%) and 65 to < 75 
years (8.7%). In contrast, the rates for vancomycin were similar across the age subsets at 18.7% for 
those aged < 65 years, 16.4% for those aged 65 to < 75 years and 18.8% (3/16) in the patients aged ≥ 
75 years.   
In the All Treated pool cardiac rhythm disturbances were more frequent in both the oritavancin and 
comparator groups in patients aged ≥ 75 years (oritavancin 13.1%; comparator 18.3%) than in patients 
aged < 65 years (3.3% vs. 2.9%) and 65 to < 75 years (7.1% vs. 3.7%). 
Gender - There were more males (oritavancin 65.3%; vancomycin 65.6%) than females enrolled in the 
SOLO pool as well as in the other pools. Females had a greater percentage of AEs, AEs resulting in death, 
SAEs and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation than males in both treatment groups in each pool. 
Race/Region - Asians had a lower percentage of AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation than the other race subgroups in the SOLO and All Treated pools but in the ARRD/I pool 
Asians had a higher percentage of AEs compared to the other race subgroups and a lower percentage of 
SAEs than Whites. The percentage of patients with AEs and SAEs was lower in the rest of world vs. N. 
America in both treatment groups in the SOLO, ARRD/I and All Treated pools but the rates for AEs and 
SAEs were comparable between treatments within each region.  
Weight - In the SOLO pool 67.0% of all patients were 60 to < 100 kg while 17.8% oritavancin and 16.8% 
vancomycin patients were < 60 kg and 15.5% vs. 16.4% were ≥ 100 kg, respectively. Patients who 
weighed ≥ 100 kg had the highest rates of AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation in 
both treatment groups.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The frequency of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was comparable in the oritavancin (3.7%) and 
vancomycin (4.2%) groups in the SOLO pool (see table below). The most frequently reported AEs leading 
to study drug discontinuation were cellulitis and osteomyelitis in the oritavancin group and cellulitis, 
hypersensitivity, skin infection and pruritus in the vancomycin group. The median time to onset of AEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation was 1.7 days (0 to 6 days) and 2.2 days (0 to 9 days) in respective 
treatment groups. 
The frequencies of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation in the ARRD/I pool were oritavancin 3.9% 
and vancomycin 6.8% while rates in the All Treated pool were 4.3% vs. 4.6%.

Table 63 
The most frequent (≥ 0.3%) AEs leading to study drug discontinuation in the ARRD/I pool were sepsis 
and septic shock in the oritavancin group and red man syndrome, cardiac arrest, pneumonia, allergic 
dermatitis and delirium tremens in the vancomycin group. The median time to onset of AEs leading to 
study drug discontinuation was 3.1 days (0 to 43 days) and 0.9 days (0 to 43 days) in respective 
treatment groups. 
In the All Treated pool, the most frequent (≥ 0.2%) AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were 
pyrexia and urticaria in the oritavancin group and cellulitis, skin infection, rash, red man syndrome, drug 
hypersensitivity, and hypersensitivity in the vancomycin group. The median time to onset of AEs leading 
to study drug discontinuation was 2.5 days (0 to 43 days) and 1.9 days (0 to 43 days) in the oritavancin 
and comparator groups, respectively, in the All Treated pool. 
The table below shows all discontinuations (not just those in at least 2 patients) due to AEs that could 
have been due to hypersensitivity. There was no excess of such AEs in the oritavancin group in any 
patient pool.

Table 64 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database includes 1075 patients with ABSSSI who were treated with a single 1200 mg dose of 
oritavancin infused over 3 h. With few exceptions there are no marked differences between oritavancin 
and vancomycin. 
Oritavancin is less likely than vancomycin to be associated with HLIRs or true allergic reactions. 
Cross-hypersensitivity between other glycopeptides and oritavancin seems unlikely but caution is 
required. 
In the SOLO pool cardiac AE rates were 3.4% for oritavancin and 2.7% for vancomycin, with a higher rate 
of tachycardia with oritavancin (2.5% vs. 1.1%) but further analyses have not explained the imbalance 
and have shown that events were not clustered around Cmax. 
A consistent and very notable higher rate of osteomyelitis cases (total 22 vs. 2 for comparators) has been 
observed with oritavancin in SOLO I and II (6 vs. 1) and in ARRD/I (13 vs. 0). In addition, in the SOLO 
studies the rates of abscesses (total of abscess and abscess in limb) were 3.9% for oritavancin vs. 1.9% 
for vancomycin while the difference in ARRD/I was 3.3% vs. 2.6%. Most of these were 
treatment-emergent rather than worsening of a baseline abscess. These imbalances have not been 
explained. The issue has been reflected in the SmPC. 
The higher rate of AEs of ALT increased for oritavancin in SOLO I and II influenced the overall higher rates 
of hepatic events reported as AEs (4.7% vs. 3.0%). There was no imbalance in ARRD/I and a small 
difference in the All Treated pool (1.3% vs. 0.9%). In contrast, the rates for PCS increases in ALT (or AST) 
were not higher for oritavancin in the SOLO I and II or other pools. PCS increases in bilirubin occurred 
more often for oritavancin in SOLO I and II only and this finding was accompanied by more patients 
(although numbers are very small) with concomitant PCS values for bilirubin and one or more of ALT, AST 
and ALP. Independent review indicated that no patient fulfilled Hy’s law criteria.  
The rates for PCS hyponatraemia values were consistently higher for oritavancin vs. vancomycin. This 
seems to have been related to the higher proportion with diabetes and to the association between 
hyperglycaemia and hyponatraemia.

Thrombocytopenia (or decreased platelets) was reported as an AE in 5 oritavancin and no vancomycin 
patients in the SOLO studies and in 12 vs. 2 in the All Treated pool. Counts < 75 x 109/L showed a 
difference only for the All Treated pool (15 vs. 3 cases; 0.6% vs. 0.2%) but missing data and concomitant 
medications associated with low platelets limit any further comment.    
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
There are several concerns that will be followed up via the RMP. In particular, the consistent imbalances 
between treatments in the SOLO, and ARRD/I and All Treated pools for AEs of osteomyelitis and 
abscesses suggest that oritavancin could have some detrimental effect on the migration or function of 
phagocytic cells in deep seated tissues despite the fact that efficacy against ABSSSI was comparable to 
that of vancomycin and in-vitro studies showed macrophages to retain functionality.

excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use:  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of oritavancin. If 
an acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs during oritavancin infusion, oritavancin 
should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care should be 
instituted.  
No data are available on cross-reactivity between oritavancin and other glycopeptides, 
including vancomycin. Before using oritavancin it is important to inquire carefully 
about previous hypersensitivity reactions to glycopeptides (e.g. vancomycin, 
telavancin). Due to the possibility of cross-hypersensitivity, there should be careful 
monitoring of patients with any history of glycopeptide hypersensitivity during and 
after the infusion. 
Infusion related reactions 
Oritavancin is given via intravenous infusion over 3 hours to minimise the risk of 
infusion related reactions. Oritavancin has been shown to cause infusion related 
reactions including pruritus, urticaria or flushing. If reactions do occur, stopping or 
slowing the infusion should be considered to mitigate the reaction (see section 4.8). 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects  
The pooled ABSSSI Phase 3 clinical trials included 976 adult patients were treated with 
a single once-only 1200 mg  dose of oritavancin. Adverse reactions were reported at 
similar frequencies for oritavancin and the comparator regimen. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5%) were: nausea, 
hypersensitivity reactions, infusion site reactions, and headache. The most commonly 
reported serious adverse reaction was cellulitis (1.1% (11/ 976). The most commonly 
reported reasons for discontinuation were cellulitis (0.4%, 4/976) and osteomyelitis 
(0.3%, 3/976). 
The Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) contains similar information regarding the risk of 
hypersensitivity.

Drug interaction 
with warfarin 
Assessment report  
EMA/183786/2015  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of oritavancin and warfarin may result in higher exposure of 
warfarin (resulting in 31% increase in the mean area under the curve (AUC) of 
warfarin), which may increase the risk of bleeding (see SmPC section 4.5). Oritavancin 
should only be used in patients on chronic warfarin therapy when the benefits can be 
expected to outweigh the risk of bleeding; these patients should be frequently 
monitored for signs of bleeding.  
Oritavancin has been shown to artificially prolong prothrombin time (PT) and 
international normalised ratio (INR) for up to 24 hours, making the monitoring of the 
anticoagulation effect of warfarin unreliable up to 24 hours after an oritavancin dose. 
Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction:  
Substances metabolised by cytochrome P450  
A cocktail drug-drug interaction study was conducted in healthy volunteers (n=16) 
evaluating the concomitant administration of a single 1,200 mg dose of oritavancin 
with probe substrates for several CYP450 enzymes. Oritavancin was found to be a 
nonspecific, weak inhibitor (CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) or a weak inducer (CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6) of several CYP isoforms. 
Caution should be used when administering oritavancin concomitantly with medicinal 
products with a narrow therapeutic window that are predominantly metabolised by 
one of the affected CYP450 enzymes (e.g., warfarin), as co-administration may 
increase (e.g., for CYP2C9 substrates) or decrease (e.g., for CYP2D6 substrates) 
concentrations of the narrow therapeutic range medicinal product. Patients should be 
closely monitored for signs of toxicity or lack of efficacy if they have been given 
oritavancin while on a potentially affected compound (e.g. patients should be 
monitored for bleeding if concomitantly receiving oritavancin and warfarin) (see 
section 4.4).  
Coagulation test 
interference 
The PIL contains similar information regarding the risk of a drug interaction with 
warfarin. 
Information provided in SmPC: 
Section 4.3 Contraindications: 
Use of intravenous unfractionated heparin sodium is contraindicated for 48 hours after 
oritavancin administration because the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 
test results are expected to remain falsely elevated for approximately 48 hours after 
oritavancin administration (see sections 4.4 and 4.5)  
None 
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use: 
Interference with assay for coagulation tests  
Oritavancin has been shown to artificially prolong aPTT for 48 hours and the PT and 
INR for 24 hours by binding to and preventing action of the phospholipid reagents 
which activate coagulation in commonly used laboratory coagulation tests. For 
patients who require aPTT monitoring within 48 hours of oritavancin dosing, a 
non-phospholipid dependent coagulation test such as a Factor Xa (chromogenic) 
assay or an alternative anticoagulant not requiring aPTT monitoring may be 
considered.  
Effects by oritavancin on activated clotting time (ACT) are expected since the 
phospholipid reagents are also utilized in this coagulation test.  Although oritavancin 
interfered with certain tests used to monitor coagulation, no known effect on the 
coagulation system has been observed.   
Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction:  
Drug-Laboratory test interactions  
Oritavancin has been shown to artificially prolong aPTT for 48 hours and PT and INR for 
up to 24 hours by binding to and preventing action of the phospholipid reagents which 
activate coagulation in commonly used laboratory coagulation tests. Effects by 
oritavancin on activated clotting time (ACT) are expected since the phospholipid 
reagents are also utilised in this coagulation test (see section 4.4).

Abscess 
In the Phase 3 clinical trials, slightly more cases of newly emergent abscesses were 
reported in the oritavancin-treated arm than in the vancomycin-treated arm (4.6% vs 
3.4%, respectively) (see section 4.8). If newly emergent abscesses occur, appropriate 
measures should be taken.

Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use:  
Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea 
Antibacterial-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported for 
oritavancin and may range in severity from mild to life threatening diarrhoea. 
Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with 
diarrhoea subsequent to the administration of oritavancin (see SmPC section 4.8). In 
such a circumstance, the use of supportive measures together with the administration 
of specific treatment for Clostridium difficile should be considered.

Information provided in SmPC:  
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use:  
Osteomyelitis  
In Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials, more cases of osteomyelitis were reported in the 
oritavancin-treated arm than in the vancomycin-treated arm (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of osteomyelitis after 
administration of oritavancin. If osteomyelitis is suspected or diagnosed, appropriate 
alternative antibacterial therapy should be instituted.  
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects: The most common reported reasons for 
discontinuation were cellulitis (0.4%, 4/976) and osteomyelitis (0.3%, 3/976). 
Osteomyelitis is listed as an uncommon ADR.

Information provided in SmPC: 
Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications: Orbactiv is indicated for the treatment of 
acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults (see sections 4.4 
and 5.1).  
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of 
antibacterial agents. 
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use:  
Need for additional antibacterial agents 
Oritavancin is active against Gram positive bacteria only (see section 5.1). In mixed 
infections where Gram negative and/or certain types of anaerobic bacteria are 
suspected, oritavancin should be co-administered with appropriate antibacterial 
agent(s). 
Limitations of the clinical data 
In the two major trials in ABSSSI the types of infections treated were confined to 
cellulitis, abscesses and wound infections only. Other types of infections have not been 
studied. There is limited experience in clinical studies in patients with bacteraemia, 
peripheral vascular disease or neutropenia, in immunocompromised patients, in 
patients aged > 65 years and in infections due to S. pyogenes. 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Resistance 
Gram-negative organisms are intrinsically resistant to all glycopeptides, including 
oritavancin. 
Resistance to oritavancin was observed in vitro in vancomycin-resistant isolates of 
Staphylococcus aureus. There is no known cross-resistance between oritavancin and 
non-glycopeptide classes of antibiotics. 
Oritavancin exhibits reduced in vitro activity against certain Gram-positive organisms

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Oritavancin is a novel antibiotic belonging to the glycopeptide antibacterials.  It inhibits bacterial cell wall 
biosynthesis and disrupts bacterial membrane integrity, leading to rapid cell death.  Efficacy has been 
demonstrated in clinical studies against common aetiological agents of ABSSSI shown to be susceptible to 
oritavancin in vitro.  However, in common with all glycopeptides, the spectrum of activity intrinsically 
excludes Gram-negative organisms.  There seems no known cross-resistance between oritavancin and 
non-glycopeptide classes of antibiotics. 
The clinical efficacy of oritavancin in ABSSSI has been evaluated in two phase 3 randomised controlled 
studies of identical design (SOLO-1 and SOLO-2) that recruited a total of 1987 patients (ITT population).  
Patients were required to have cellulitis/erysipelas, major cutaneous abscess or wound infection with a 
minimum total lesion surface area of 75 cm2 and at least one regional or systemic sign of infection.  
Oritavancin was given on Day 1 as a single 1200 mg dose in 1000 mL of 5% D5W over 3 h. Vancomycin 
was administered IV for 7 to 10 days.  Aztreonam and metronidazole were allowed for patients with mixed 
infections. 
Non-inferiority of oritavancin compared to vancomycin was shown, based on the clinical cure rates at 
post-treatment evaluation (PTE) in the mITT (79.6% vs 80.0% for SOLO-1; 82.7 vs 80.5% for SOLO-2) 
and CE populations and the sensitivity analyses supported the primary analysis. The lower bounds of the 
95%  CI  were  well  within  -10%.    In  addition,  the  results  at  the  early  clinical  evaluation  (ECE)  visit 
supported a conclusion of general comparability between treatment groups.   
The microbiological success rates were comparable between treatment groups by type of infection.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The in-vitro data indicate that very few staphylococci that are of intermediate susceptibility or resistant to 
glycopeptides would be treatable with oritavancin and there are no clinical data on the use of oritavancin 
to treat organisms for which the vancomycin MIC exceeds 1 mg/L. It appears unlikely that oritavancin can

EMA/183786/2015  
Page 89/92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be used to treat VISA or VRSA and there are too few data to conclude on hVISA. In addition, it does not 
appear that oritavancin can be relied upon to treat daptomycin-insusceptible staphylococci.   
There are limitations regarding the host and ABSSSI disease aspects of the patients in whom efficacy has 
been evaluated although there are no clear theoretical reasons to doubt the sufficiency of the dose 
regimen for a wider population. Indeed, there is limited experience in clinical studies in patients with 
bacteraemia, peripheral vascular disease or neutropenia, in immunocompromised patients, in patients 
aged > 65 years and in infections due to S. pyogenes.  These limitations are noted in section 4.4 of SmPC. 
At present it is unclear why there has been a consistent finding of excess treatment emergent infections 
affecting deep tissues (bones) and abscesses for oritavancin vs. vancomycin but there has to be concern 
that this reflects some detrimental impact of oritavancin on normal immune defences that may be related 
to the high degree of intracellular accumulation especially in macrophages.   
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of oritavancin resembles that for vancomycin and for many SOCs and PTs, the AE rates 
have been similar or lower for oritavancin. In particular the rates for AEs that may reflect HLIRs or 
hypersensitivity reactions appear to be lower for oritavancin.  
In contrast, the rates for treatment-emergent infections, including osteomyelitis and abscesses, have 
now been shown to be higher for oritavancin regardless of single or multiple dose regimens. This is of 
concern, especially when the underlying mechanism(s) for the seemingly consistent difference remains 
the subject of conjecture (see above).  
In addition, the rates for hepatic AEs and for numbers with concomitant PCS values across the LFTs have 
been higher with oritavancin although no patient has been judged to have met Hy’s law and the actual 
numbers are low. Also, the rates for cardiac AEs, driven by the numbers with tachycardias, have been 
higher for oritavancin. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are some unanswered questions regarding the transport of oritavancin into bile and into various 
types of cells, which could have possible implications for the safety profile in some individuals. 
There are some unexplained apparent anomalies between reporting rates for some types of laboratory 
abnormalities as AEs vs. the rates for PCS values.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Oritavancin does not have any antibacterial properties that could be viewed as definite and proven 
advantages over other intravenous agents that have antibacterial spectra confined to certain 
Gram-positive organisms. However, it offers a single parenteral treatment with efficacy against ABSSSI 
that was shown to be comparable to that of vancomycin in two adequately powered Phase 3 studies. 
While it appears that the risk of treatment-emergent infections of bone and abscesses is higher with 
oritavancin, and this may or may not be a result of its tissue accumulation and effects on normal immune 
defences, this fact alone would not preclude an approval provided that there are adequate warnings in the 
SmPC. In addition, although it seems that there could be a slightly higher risk of some other types of AEs 
vs. vancomycin, the differences do not raise major issues on grounds of safety.

Benefit-risk balance 
The overall B/R of Orbactiv is considered as positive in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin 
structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Skin infections are among the most common infections seen in clinical practice; these infections may 
require systemic antibiotic therapy, surgical management, and hospitalization and, if untreated, may 
become severe or life-threatening depending on the pathogen [Corey and Stryjewski, 2011; Elston, 
2005].  
The morbidity associated with ABSSSI often requires rapid antimicrobial intervention to minimize tissue 
damage and prevent the spread of infection. The clinical complications of delayed or inappropriate 
treatment of skin and skin structure infections can be serious, including those resulting from local spread, 
secondary bacteraemia with potential for distant metastatic foci of infection, and systemic effects [Davis 
et al, 2007].  
Patients and healthcare providers face challenges with the treatments available for ABSSSI, specifically 
for the treatment of MRSA infections. Current therapies consist of multi-dose and multi-day regimens with 
some requiring dosage adjustments for renal insufficiency, therapeutic monitoring, and precautionary 
use in pregnant women. Multi-dose therapies may require patients to be hospitalized for the course of 
their antibiotic treatment over multiple days, increasing the risk of acquiring or spreading infection. 
Treatment non-compliance can also be an issue with these regimens, increasing the potential for 
pathogen resistance [CDC, 2011].  As demonstrated in the Phase 3 SOLO studies, a single 1200 mg dose 
of oritavancin is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for ABSSSI, including those caused by MRSA. 
Single-dose treatment was non-inferior to 7-10 days of vancomycin treatment and showed consistent and 
reproducible results across all efficacy endpoints, including early clinical response at 48-72 hours and 
clinical cure at 10-14 days post therapy. 
The Phase-3 SOLO studies demonstrated that a single 1200 mg IV dose of oritavancin was well tolerated 
and had a similar safety profile to 7 to 10 days of vancomycin treatment (1 g or 15 mg/kg twice daily).  
The most frequently reported AEs were nausea, hypersensitivity reactions, infusion site reactions, and 
headache. Caution should be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to glycopeptides and patients 
taking warfarin concomitantly. The risk of treatment-emergent infections of bone and abscesses is higher 
with oritavancin, warranting adequate warnings in the SmPC. 
Oritavancin is a mild inhibitor of CYP2C9 enzymes, and therefore, has the potential to increase warfarin 
concentrations when administered concomitantly.   The potential for oritavancin to inhibit or induce 
CYP2C8 was not evaluated and will be provided as a PAM.  Also, appropriate transporter studies will be 
provided. 
Due to oritavancin’s interference with some laboratory coagulation tests, reliable monitoring of 
coagulation status is not possible. Patients who are on warfarin should be closely monitored for signs of 
bleeding. Safety of 1200 mg IV dose of Orbactiv in patients on concomitant chronic warfarin who are 
being treated for ABSSSI, will be further addressed as a PAM. 
No adjustment of the oritavancin dose is necessary for age, weight, renal or liver function. No therapeutic 
drug monitoring for efficacy is required for oritavancin.

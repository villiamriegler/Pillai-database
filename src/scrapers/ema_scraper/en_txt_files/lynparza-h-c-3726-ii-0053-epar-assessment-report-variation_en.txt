2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
The applied indication for Lynparza was, in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or 
prednisolone, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. 
The recommended indication for Lynparza is, in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or 
prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC in whom chemotherapy is not clinically 
indicated (see section 5.1). 
Epidemiology  
Worldwide in 2020, prostate cancer was estimated to be the fifth most common cause of cancer death 
in men. In Europe in 2020, prostate cancer was estimated the third most common cause of cancer death 
(American Cancer Society 2021, Siegel et al 2021, ECIS 2020).  
Almost all patients dying from prostate cancer will have mCRPC, and 90% of overall mortality in mCRPC 
patients is attributable to the underlying malignant disease (Scher et al 2015). For patients diagnosed 
with metastatic disease, the 5-year survival rate is 30% (American Society of Cancer 2019, Siegel et al 
2019). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Most prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas. Following the initial evaluation and diagnosis, 
approximately 90% of men undergo primary localized treatment with curative intent (Cooperberg et al, 
2010). Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (i.e., surgical or medical castration) is often initiated in 
men with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after primary therapy. Following ADT, the next most 
frequent clinical state in the current model of prostate cancer progression is that of CRPC, defined as 
disease progression despite castrate hormone levels (testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL). Men with CRPC can 
have metastatic or non-metastatic disease. In the majority of patients, metastatic CRPC evolves from 
non-metastatic CRPC and PSA doubling time has been shown to be a strong predictor of the 
development of metastases in these patients (Moreira et al, 2015; Scher et al, 2015).Androgen 
deprivation therapy with luteinising hormone releasing hormone analogues or orchiectomy is usually 
initially effective at controlling metastatic disease. A good prognostic factor in prostate cancer is when 
the patients are diagnosed at an early stage and with localised disease. 
Almost all patients in advanced stages will ultimately develop mCRPC, which progresses rapidly. 
Around 60 % of patients with non-metastatic CRPC will developed metastatic disease during the first 5 
years (Khirby et al 2011).  
Metastatic  castration  resistant  prostate  cancer  is  associated  with  a  range  of  symptoms  but  is 
predominantly characterised by bone pain, fatigue, and urinary dysfunction. Metastasis is predominantly 
localized  in  bones  (90%  of  patients  with  metastatic  castration-resistant  prostate  cancer),  causing 
significant morbidity which requires medical interventions (pain and skeletal-related events, spinal cord 
compression, pathological fractures, etc). 
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022  
Page 11/154 
 
 
 
 
Between 24% to 30% of mCRPCs have loss of function mutations in genes involved in homologous 
recombination repair (HRR) of DNA damage response (Abida et al 2017, Armenia et al 2018, Chung et 
al 2019, Mateo et al 2015, Robinson et al 2015).  
In this application, the HRR genes refer to a family of 15 pre-specified genes with a biological rationale 
for loss of function to predict sensitivity to olaparib. 
Management 
According  to  ESMO  guideline  on  cancer  of  the  prostate  (2020),  the  recommended  treatments  of 
metastatic  CRPC  are  new  hormonal  agents  (NHAs)  such  as  abiraterone  or  enzalutamide  for 
asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic CRPC, radium-223 for 
patients with bone-predominant symptomatic metastatic CRPC without visceral metastases, docetaxel 
and  cabazitaxel  for  patients  with  metastatic  CRPC  is  an  option  in  asymptomatic/mildly  symptomatic 
patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic CRPC. 
Bone protective agents should be used in men with mCRPC to prevent fractures. 
The optimal sequence or combination of these agents (abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223, docetaxel 
and  cabazitaxel)  is  still  unknown.  In  practice,  sequencing  decisions  will  be  made  in  the  light  of  the 
distribution, extent and pace of disease, co-morbidities, patient preferences and drug availability.  
Evaluation of a new treatment option that would allow for early intervention in the course of mCRPC 
and that could also prolong the treatment duration of available therapies, delay disease progression, 
and improve long-term outcomes in this setting is warranted. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Lynparza is approved in EU for the treatment of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas and prostate cancer. 
The MAH applied for a new indication for olaparib tablets formulation in combination with abiraterone 
and prednisone or prednisolone, as follows: 
Lynparza in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. 
Olaparib, the active substance of Lynparza, is a potent oral human PARP inhibitor (PARP-1, PARP-2, 
and PARP-3) that exploits deficiencies in DNA repair pathways to preferentially kill cancer cells with 
these deficits compared to normal cells.  
Abiraterone is a potent, oral inhibitor of testosterone biosynthesis. Abiraterone selectively inhibits the 
CYP17 enzyme which is required for androgen biosynthesis.  
The scientific rationale for the combination of olaparib and abiraterone is based on the preclinical 
evidence indicating two plausible mechanisms. The first hypothesis involves PARP-1 transcriptional 
roles: beyond its function in DNA repair, PARP-1 has been implicated in modulation of transcription 
(Schiewer and Knudsen 2014) which may be especially relevant in hormone dependent cancers, as 
nuclear hormone receptors have been reported to require catalytically active PARP-1 as a positive co-
regulator of target gene expression (Ju et al 2006). The second mechanistic explanation that may 
account for the activity of olaparib in combination with abiraterone is the induction of an HRR-deficient 
phenotype through non-genetic mechanisms, via inhibition of AR signalling. Several lines of evidence 
have been reported that support this possibility, including downregulation of HRR gene transcripts and 
Assessment report

protein levels in response to inhibition of AR signalling in prostate cancer correlated with deficient DNA 
repair and increased DNA damage sensitivity (Goodwin et al 2013, Asim et al 2017, Li et al 2017). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical part of this application is based on literature concerning the efficacy of the 
combination of olaparib and anti-androgens. No new non-clinical studies have been conducted by the 
Applicant. A new environmental risk assessment report has been submitted. 
Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Olaparib is indicated in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment 
of adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. 
The applicant submitted non-clinical scientific publications that include data from studies conducted in 
vitro and/or in vivo (Schiewer and Knudsen 2014; Ju et al 2006; Schiewer et al 2012; Goodwin et al 
2013, Asim et al 2017, Li et al 2017). These articles demonstrate the involvement of androgen 
receptors in promoting the expression of genes involved in DNA repair and highlight the increase in the 
expression of homologous recombination genes in castration-resistant prostate cancers, promoting the 
survival of cancer cells. The data from the papers demonstrate that blocking the transcription of 
androgen receptors leads to a decrease in the expression of DNA repair genes, which would lead to an 
overactivation of PARP. This would mean that by blocking androgen receptor transcription and 
inhibiting the PARP enzyme, cell growth and survival would be reduced. 
The articles include in vitro studies where the combination of anti-androgens with olaparib show to 
cause an increase in DNA damage with a greater reduction in repair as well as a reduction in cell 
proliferation compared to monotherapies in cellular models of prostate cancer. In vivo and in the 
absence of HRR mutation, according to the results of the articles, comparable efficacy has been 
demonstrated for olaparib as monotherapy and for the olaparib + enzlutamide combination.

2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The potential environmental impact from use of the drug substance olaparib has already been evaluated 
and supported approval of the capsule (ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer) and of the 
tablet  formulation  (epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer,  metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer) as a monotherapy. 
An updated ERA covering this extension of indication has been submitted.

Conclusion 
Olaparib is very persistant. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical part of this application is based on articles concerning the efficacy of the combination 
of olaparib and anti-androgens. No new non-clinical studies have been submitted by the applicant 
which is considered acceptable. 
The scientific rationale for the combination of abiraterone and olaparib is based on preclinical literature 
data indicating two plausible mechanisms that may explain the independent biomarker activity of the 
olaparib-abiraterone combination. The first mechanism of action demonstrates the involvement of 
PARP in the positive co-regulation of androgen receptor signalling, which would reduce the level of 
androgen receptor signalling.  Studies presented highlight the effect of PARP inhibition which 
significantly reduces AR expression in a non-clinical model of prostate cancer compared to a positive 
control.  It also appears that PARP inhibitors further reduce AR expression in castrated mice. The level 
of expression of androgen receptors plays an important role in prostate cancer in terms of cell survival 
and also resistance to castration. The proposed mechanism seems plausible.  
The second mechanism mentioned concerns the decrease in transcription of homologous 
recombination genes induced by the blocking of androgen receptor transcription. By decreasing the 
transcription of genes involved in homologous recombination, the activity of the PARP enzyme would 
be increased, which can justify from a mechanistic point of view the use of the anti-androgen and PARP 
inhibitor combination. 
An updated ERA for Lynparza (olaparib) has been provided. The PECsw for the prostate cancer 
indications has been updated.  
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The scientific rationale for the combination of abiraterone and olaparib is based on the preclinical 
evidence indicating two plausible mechanisms that may account for the biomarker independent activity 
of the olaparib-abiraterone combination. Pre-clinical studies in prostate cancer models reported a 
combined anti-tumour effect when PARP inhibitors and next-generation hormonal agents are 
administered together. PARP is involved in positive co-regulation of androgen receptor (AR) signalling, 
which leads to enhanced AR target gene suppression when PARP/AR signalling is co-inhibited. Other 
pre-clinical studies reported that treatment with NHAs inhibit the transcription of some HRR genes, 
therefore, inducing HRR deficiency and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors via non-genetic 
mechanisms (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The environmental risk file is complete and well-constructed. The PECsw for the prostate cancer 
indications has been updated for this amendment request as well as the relevant sections of the Phase 
II Level A and B assessment. Considering the above data, olaparib is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Olaparib  is  a  potent,  oral  inhibitor  of  PARP  that  exploits  deficiencies  in  DNA  repair  pathways  and 
selectively targets cancer cells with these deficiencies compared to normal cells. 
In Europe, olaparib as a capsule formulation was approved under the brand name of Lynparza in 2014 
for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. An oral tablet formulation was subsequently 
approved  for  the  maintenance  treatment  of  patients  with  PSR  ovarian  cancer  in  addition  to  other 
indications in prostate, ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancer.  
The tablet formulation of olaparib is being evaluated in all ongoing Phase III studies and consisted of 
two strengths of film-coated tablets of 100 and 150 mg.

Methods 
• 
Analytical methods 
For each analytes a dedicated unique bioanalytical method was developed, and summary results are 
presented below. 
Olaparib 
A unique bioanalytical method was used to quantify olaparib in human plasma.  
The initial methods for olaparib measurement were developed and validated in human plasma using 
lithium heparin as anticoagulant. Additional partial validation in K2EDTA human plasma was conducted. 
No analytically significant interference from endogenous plasma components was observed at the 
retention times of olaparib or internal standard in the plasma samples screened. The lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) of the assay was 20.0 ng/mL and the assay was shown to be linear up to 20000 
ng/mL. Within-batch precision for olaparib was found to be <8.4% and within-batch accuracy for 
olaparib was found to be between 91.0% and 101.1%. 
The stability of olaparib, in K2EDTA human plasma was demonstrated for up to four cycles of freezing 
and thawing. Olaparib in K2EDTA human plasma was shown to be stable for up to 24 hours when 
stored at room temperature and for up to 385 days when stored at either approximately -20°C or -
80°C.  
Abiraterone/Delta4-abiraterone 
A unique bioanalytical method (Method ABD4HPP, Report 8394706) was used to quantify abiraterone 
and its metabolite in human plasma with K2EDTA as anticoagulant.  
Calibration, QC and clinical study samples (50 μL) were spiked with internal standards (abiraterone-d4 
for both analytes), processed by liquid-liquid extraction and simultaneously. 
Table 1: Results summary 
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022

The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the assay was 1 ng/ml and 0.1 ng/mL for abiraterone and 
delta4-abiraterone respectively; and the assay was shown to be linear up to 500 ng/ml and 20 ng/mL, 
for  abiraterone  and  delta4-abiraterone,  respectively.  Within-batch  precision  was  found to  be  between 
1.0%  to  7.3%,  and  1.0%  to  8.8%  for  abiraterone  and  abiraterone  D4A  respectively.  Between-batch 
precision was found to be between 1.8% and 11.3%, and 3.4% and 7.8% for abiraterone and delta4-
abiraterone  respectively.  Within-batch  accuracy  was  found  to  be  between  86.2%  and  111.7%,  and 
92.9% and 105.0% for abiraterone and delta4-abiraterone respectively. Between-batch accuracy was 
found to be between 99.2% and 108.0%, and 96.2% and 99.3% for abiraterone and delta4- abiraterone 
respectively. 
Long term stability in plasma at -20°C or -80°C was demonstrated up to 365 days.

Standard non-compartmental analysis (NCA) has been performed to estimate PK parameters at 
steady-state (Cmaxss, Tmaxss, Cminss, AUC0-8)   from a subset of patients from Study 
D081SC00001 using Phoenix WinNonlin Version 8.1. 
Pharmacokinetic in target population 
Olaparib and abiraterone/D4-abiraterone PK has been evaluated in two clinical studies D081SC00001 
(PROpel) and D081DC00008 (presented in the next section) 
Study D081SC00001 
Design 
Study D081SC00001 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre international 
Phase III study to evaluate olaparib in combination with abiraterone vs placebo in combination with 
abiraterone as first line therapy in biomarker unselected patients with mCRPC who had not received 
prior chemotherapy or NHAs for mCRPC.  
Patients received oral treatment with olaparib 300 mg BID + abiraterone 1000 mg QD or placebo BID + 
abiraterone 1000 mg QD. Patients (n=796) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment with abiraterone 
was given as per label and included prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg bd for both treatment groups. 
PK sampling consisted of pre-dose, 30 min, 2h, 3h, 5h and 8h post dose on approximately Day 29 of the 
study. Olaparib plasma concentrations were determined in the olaparib arm whereas abiraterone in both 
arms. For olaparib, the pre-dose concentration was used as the 12h post-dose concentration to calculate 
AUCss and CLss/F. 
Results 
Olaparib 
Following  multiple  dosing  to  steady  state  at  300  mg  BID,  olaparib  absorption  was  rapid  with  median 
Tmax,ss of 2.0 hours. Geometric mean AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss were 39.3 μg
h/mL, 6.28 μg/mL 
and 1.01 μg/mL, respectively as shown in Table 2.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Treatment with abiraterone was given as per label (Zytiga, SmPC) and included prednisone or 
prednisolone 5 mg bd for both treatment groups for mCRPC treatment.  
Potential PK interactions between olaparib and abiraterone has been assessed in two clinical studies: 
Study D081DC00008, and Study D081SC00001 (PROpel), presented below. 
Effect of abiraterone on olaparib pharmacokinetics 
Study D081DC00008 
Safety: To assess the safety and tolerability of olaparib when given in addition to 
abiraterone and to recommend, by assessment of dose-limiting toxicities and other 
safety and tolerability data, a dose of olaparib for further study when given in 
addition to abiraterone 
Primary 
Objective 
Efficacy: To compare the efficacy of olaparib when given in addition to abiraterone, 
with 
placebo given in addition to abiraterone, by assessment of rPFS (Investigator 
determined) using RECIST 1.1 and PCWG-2 criteria. 
Only objective related to PK interactions is reported 
Secondary 
objective  
Part 1: To evaluate the presence of any drug interaction between olaparib and 
abiraterone by determination of steady state exposure to olaparib in the presence 
and absence of abiraterone, and determination of steady state exposure to 
abiraterone in the presence and absence of olaparib. 
Phase 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Part A was an open-label safety run-in study to assess the safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of olaparib when given in addition to abiraterone 1000 mg

The data show that when olaparib was co-administered with abiraterone, the Gmean PK parameter 
ratios of non-log transformed data for Css,max and Css,min were slightly lower (approximately 15% 
and 22% lower, respectively) and the overall exposure based on AUCss was similar (1.4% lower) 
compared with olaparib administered as monotherapy. The individual ratio data show that all Css,min 
ratios were below 1 and that the AUCss and Css,max ratios were distributed both above and below 1 
(ranging between 31% lower and 22% higher for Css,max and between 26% lower and 20% higher for 
AUCss) indicating no clear trend for exposure in combination to be higher or lower than that in 
monotherapy. 
Cross-study analysis 
The steady state PK exposure parameters for olaparib in PROpel and in other olaparib phase III 
monotherapy studies are summarized in Table 5. The results from the table indicate that steady state

exposures based on Cmax,ss, AUCss or Cmin,ss for olaparib in PROpel are similar to olaparib steady 
state exposures in SOLO2, OlympiA and OlympiAD and are slightly lower to those in SOLO3 and 
PROfound. Box plots of Olaparib Cmax,ss, AUCss or Cmin,ss as stratified by phase III studies are 
shown in Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, respectively. The corresponding interquartile ranges for all 
exposure parameters in PROpel overlap significantly with those from other studies including SOLO3 
and PROfound, confirming that olaparib steady state exposures when dosed in combination with 
abiraterone in PROpel are similar to olaparib steady state exposures in all Phase III monotherapy 
studies.

Figure 8: Geometric Mean (± GSD Error Bars) Plasma Concentrations (ng/mL) of Delta4-
abiraterone – Study Day 29 – Semi-logarithmic Plot (PK Analysis Set) 
The slight increase in abiraterone exposure and the decrease in delta4-abiraterone exposure when 
abiraterone 1000 mg qd was co-administered with olaparib 300 mg bd, resulted in metabolite to 
parent ratios of the exposure parameters (MRAUC0-8, MRCmax,ss, and MRCmin,ss) approximately 
31%, 31%, and 23% lower, respectively, than that observed for abiraterone 1000 mg qd administered 
alone.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new primary or secondary studies were provided which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of olaparib have been sufficiently characterized in the initial MAA.  
PK data from a pivotal Phase 3 study (PROpel) was submitted. In this study, the PKs of olaparib in the 
target patients were assessed and compared to other cancer patients (in other indications), by graphical 
exploration (Figure 2)  
Olaparib PK exposure following a 300 mg twice a day (BID) dosing schedule (with combination to 
abiraterone) in the PROpel study was similar to that observed in previous studies at the same dose. 
The slight increase in abiraterone exposure and the decrease in delta4-abiraterone exposure when 
abiraterone 1000 mg qd was co-administered with olaparib 300 mg bd, resulted in metabolite to 
parent ratios of the exposure parameters lower than that observed for abiraterone 1000 mg qd 
administered alone. Based on the large variability observed in the steady state exposure parameters of 
delta4-abiraterone and the low exposure of delta4-abiraterone relative to abiraterone, the small 
differences in the steady state exposure parameters of delta4-abiraterone observed between the 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022  
Page 33/154 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment arms were considered clinically not relevant. Steady state exposures (based on Cmax,ss, 
Cmin,ss, and AUC(0-8) for delta4-abiraterone were slightly lower in the olaparib+abiraterone 
treatment arm (geometric mean Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and AUC(0-8) was 20%, 23%, and 31% lower, 
respectively). Although delta4-abiraterone is an active metabolite of abiraterone, its steady state 
plasma concentrations even at Cmax,ss were just slightly above or below 3.5 ng/mL, the concentration 
required to achieve a 50%-inhibition of CYP17A1 activity (Blanchet et al 2018). Therefore, delta4-
abiraterone is unlikely to have meaningful contribution to the overall activity of abiraterone in mCPRC.  
Overall the observed olaparib AUCss distribution in the PROpel study overlap with the predicted AUCss 
from others Phase 3 studies. 
One phase 2 study, Study D081DC0008 , was presented  to evaluate potential interaction between the 
two drugs, olaparib 300 mg bid and abiraterone 1000 mg QD indicated for treatment of mCRPC patients.  
Based on this phase 2 D081DC00008, and the phase 3 PROpel studies, no clear PK interations on 
abiraterone PK was showed. Indeed, the phase 2 study (D081DC00008) was not designed to provide 
quantitative assessment of PK interaction on abiraterone PK following olaparib co-administration with 
very limited sample size (between treatment comparisons within individual N=4), and the phase 3 
study results showed large variability with very small numerical differences in PK parameters (less 
than 10% increase for Cmax,ss, and 15% increase for AUC0-8h) between the group receiving 
abiraterone only, and the other group receiving both abirateone and olaparib. In all cases, the 
observed magnitude of numerical changes after co-administration of olaparib were below 20%.  
In summary based on the phase 3 and phase 2 clinical studies, clinically significant PK interactions on 
abiraterone’s PK (co-administered with 10 mg prednisolone) is not expected.  
PK interactions between olaparib (300 mg bid) and abiraterone (1000 mg qd) in presence of 
prednisolone 10 mg per day were assessed in phase 2 D081DC00008 study, and phase 3 PROpel 
study. The results showed no clinical interactions between the two active substances.  
Given abiraterone is already indicated with 10 mg prednisolone daily (5 mg bid) in mCRPC treatment 
the absence of further documentation of prednisolone interactions with olaparib and abiraterone is 
deemed acceptable, especially considering cross-study comparisons showed olaparib PK from the 
phase 3 study D081sc00001 were comparable to previous olaparib phase 3 study administered in 
monotherapy. 
Abiraterone, olaparib, and prednisolone are CYP3A4 substrates. As interaction study with strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor was only clinically significant for olaprib, it is likely that the combination of the three 
drugs with CYP3A4 inhibitors would be driven by olaparib.  
Given the overall three drugs perpetrors potentials do not overlap, the combination of the three should 
not potentiate each drug interaction potentials. Although both olaparib and abiraterone were identified 
in vitro as CYP1A2 inducer, since abiraterone only slightly induce CYP1A2 in vitro up to 10 µM, it is 
unlikely the drug combination would result in a greater induction as compared to the drugs taken 
separately. Therefore, the presented SmPC recommendation on drug interaction is deemed sufficient. 
From a mechanistical perspective, CYP3A4/5 are the isozymes predominantly responsible for the 
metabolic clearance of olaparib and abiraterone is mainly inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolising 
enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8. In this context, no DDI is expected between the two molecules with 
Olaparib as victim. Prednisolone seems not to have any effect on the PK of CYP3A4 metabolised drugs 
like midazolam (Marcantonio E. et al. 2014) and therefore an effect is not expected on olaparib.  
Finally, no significant PK signal (>20%) is detected when these drugs are taken concomitantly in the 
phase 2 and phase 3 studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022  
Page 34/154 
 
 
 
The 300 mg BID was selected as the recommended dose of olaparib within the combination as it is 
consistent with the dose in current SmPC for the approved indications in the monotherapy setting. In 
study D081DC0008, no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in the combination of either olaparib 
200mg or 300mg. The rationale for choosing the higher dose used as monotherapy is barely justified 
by efficacy or PD data. However, as the pivotal Phase 3 trial was conducted with the dose of 300 mg, it 
is not known whether similar efficacy could be observed with a lower dose while improving the safety 
profile.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The current clinical pharmacology package provides sufficient characterisation of the key PK 
characteristics of Olaparib when combined with abiraterone. 
No  significant  difference  in  PKs  characteristics  is  observed  in  the  target  patients  in  PROpel  study  by 
comparison to the patients already assessed in other olaparib indications. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Dose response study 
No dedicated dose response study was performed. The selected dose of olaparib for the main study was 
the recommended monotherapy dose approved in its currently approved indication (300 mg BID) with 
the 150 mg strength tablet. 
The  selected  dose  for  abiraterone  acetate  was  1000  mg  with  5  mg  prednisone  (or  prednisolone) 
administered orally qd. The use of olaparib 300 mg bd in combination with abiraterone 1000 mg qd in 
the current study (PROpel) was also supported by safety and PK data from Study D081DC00008, which 
evaluated olaparib in combination with abiraterone at the same dose. 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study D081SC00001 (PROpel) 
Methods 
This  was  a  Phase  III,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicentre  study  to  assess  the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  olaparib  or  placebo,  each  combined  with  abiraterone,  as  first-line  therapy  in 
patients with mCRPC. Patients were biomarker unselected.

Sample size 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  PROpel  study  was  the  rPFS  at  DCO1  (30  July  2021).  It  was  planned  to 
randomise approximately 720 patients (1:1 ratio of olaparib/placebo), with the rPFS analysis occurring 
once approximately 324 progression or death events had occurred. 
It was expected that the targeted sample size of 720 patients with approximately 324 rPFS events (45 
% maturity) would provide 89% power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at a 1-sided 
type 1 error rate at 2.5% if the true treatment effect had a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.68, corresponding to 
an  assumed  increase  in  median  rPFS  from  16.5  months  (placebo+abiraterone)  to  24.3  months 
(olaparib+abiraterone).

The primary analysis population was all patients randomised (ITT). A subgroup analysis based on HRR 
gene mutation status (mutated, wild-type, partially characterised) was conducted to determine whether 
efficacy in the combination is independent of HRR gene mutation status but this analysis was considered 
as exploratory compared to the primary analysis in the overall population. 
Randomisation 
First patient enrolled: 31 October 2018 
Last subject enrolled: 11 March 2020 
Data cut-off date 1: 30 July 2021 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to study treatment with either olaparib in combination with abiraterone 
or placebo in combination with abiraterone.  
Randomisation was stratified by site of distant metastases at baseline (bone only, visceral or other) 
and docetaxel treatment at the mHSPC stage (yes or no). 
Blinding (masking) 
PROpel  was  a  double-blind  study.  Both  investigators  and  patients  remained  blinded  to  randomised 
treatment  for  the  study  duration.  Patients  and  investigators  were  not  routinely  unblinded  to  study 
treatment prior to the final OS analysis. 
Statistical methods 
- rPFS  
Primary analysis  
The rPFS analysis was planned for when approximately 324 events occurred and was defined as the time 
from  randomisation  until  the  earlier  date  of  objective  radiological  disease  progression,  assessed  by 
investigator, according to RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG-3 criteria (bone), or death (by any cause 
in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomised therapy or 
received another anticancer therapy prior to progression. 
rPFS was analysed using a log-rank test stratified by site of distant metastases (bone only, visceral or 
other) and docetaxel treatment at the mHSPC stage (yes or no) to calculate a 2-sided p-value. As a key 
sensitivity analysis to the primary endpoint of rPFS by investigator assessment, a sensitivity analysis of 
rPFS using BICR as per RECIST 1.1 and PCWG-3 criteria was assessed using a stratified log-rank test. 
Sensitivity analysis

Assessment of possible evaluation-time bias that may be introduced if scans are not performed 
at the protocol-scheduled time points 
Assessment of possible attrition bias by repeating the primary rpfs analysis except that the actual 
rpfs  event  times,  rather  than  the  censored  time,  of  patients  who  progressed  or  died  in  the 
absence  of  progression  immediately  following  2,  or  more,  missed  tumor  assessments  will  be 
included

(by repeating primary rpfs analysis with the addition of unequivocal progression as an event) 
Sensitivity analysis for confirmation of bone progression (by repeating primary rpfs analysis with 
revised  confirmation  criteria  for  bone  progression  where  bone  progression  accompanied  by 
unequivocal clinical progression does not require a confirmatory bone scan) 
7. 
Sensitivity analysis censoring patients with subsequent therapy or discontinuation of study drug 
(by  repeating  primary  rpfs  analysis  censoring  patients  with  subsequent  therapy  or 
discontinuation of study drug prior to progression)

The following subgroups of the full analysis set will be analysed for rPFS: 
Metastases (bone only, visceral or other) 
Docetaxel treatment at mHSPC stage (yes or no)

Secondary analysis 
- OS, was defined as the time from randomisation until date of death (due to any cause). Any 
patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded 
date on which the patient was known to be alive. Note: Survival calls were made in the week 
following the date of DCO for the analysis, and if patients were confirmed to be alive or if the 
death date was post the DCO date these patients were censored at the date of DCO. 
-  PFS2,  was  defined  as  the  time  from  randomisation  to  second  progression  on  next-line 
anticancer  therapy  following  study  treatment  discontinuation,  by  investigator  assessment  of 
radiological progression, clinical symptomatic progression, PSA progression or death, whichever 
occurred earlier. This definition of PFS2 is in accordance with the EMA draft 'Guideline on the 
clinical evaluation of anticancer medicinal products' (CHMP Anticancer Guideline 2019). 
-  Time  to  first  subsequent  anticancer  therapy  or  death,  was  defined  as  the  time  from 
randomisation to the earlier of the first subsequent anticancer therapy start date following study 
treatment discontinuation or death from any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the 
time of the analysis and not known to have had a further anticancer therapy was censored at 
the last known time to have not received subsequent therapy, ie, the last visit where this was 
confirmed. 
- TTPP, was defined as time from randomisation to pain progression based on the BPI-SF [Item 
3] “worst pain in 24 hours” and opiate analgesic use (AQA score). 
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022  
Page 43/154 
 
 
 
- Time to opiate use, was defined as the time from randomisation to the first opiate use for 
cancer-related pain. 
-  Time  to  an  SSRE,  was  defined  by  any  of  the  following  or  a  combination  thereof:  •  Use  of 
radiation  therapy  to  prevent  or  relieve  skeletal  symptoms  •  Occurrence  of  new  symptomatic 
pathological bone fractures (vertebral or non-vertebral). Radiologic documentation was required 
• Occurrence of spinal cord compression. Radiologic documentation was required • Orthopaedic 
surgical intervention for bone metastasis.  
- CTC conversion rate proportion of patients achieving CTC conversion at any time presented 
with 95% Cis  
- Time to pain severity progression Stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratio using Cox 
proportional hazard model. KM plot. Logistic regression, adjusting for metastasis category and 
docetaxel treatment at mHSPC stage  
- Pain palliation Proportion of patients with pain palliation at any time presented with 95% 
Cis. Logistic regression, adjusting for metastasis category and docetaxel treatment at mHSPC 
stage  
- FACT-P Logistic regression, adjusting for metastasis category and docetaxel treatment at 
mHSPC stage. MMRM. Time to deterioration in FACT-P (FACT-P total score, Fact-G total score, 
TOI, FWB.PWB,PCS and FAPSI 6). Stratified log-rank test.. Hazard ratio using Cox proportional 
hazard model. KM plot. Forrest plot 
A multiple testing procedure was employed across the primary endpoint of rPFS and the key secondary 
endpoint  of  OS.  The  MTP  for  the  PROpel  study  is  based  on  analyses  at  three  DCOs.  As  statistical 
significance of rPFS was achieved at DCO1, formal rPFS analysis at DCO2 will not be done and analysis 
of  this  endpoint  at  DCO2  will  be  considered  descriptive  (with  nominal  p-values  provided).  OS  was 
formally analysed at DCO1 (interim analysis), and will be at DCO2 (interim analysis), and DCO3 (final 
analysis).  The  1-sided  alpha  of  0.025  is  fully  allocated  to  rPFS.  If  the  result  for  rPFS  is  statistically 
significant,  OS  will  be  tested  in  a  hierarchical  fashion.  A  multiplicity  testing  procedure  based  on  the 
graphical approach in group sequential trials of Maurer and Bretz (Maurer and Bretz 2013), analogous 
to a simple sequential gatekeeping method, strongly controls the overall family-wise 1-sided error rate 
of 2.5%.

HRR testing results  
PROpel is an all-comers study and patient enrolment was not based on biomarker status. HRRm status 
was tested retrospectively using a ctDNA-based test (FoundationOne® Liquid CDx) and a tumour tissue 
test (FoundationOne® CDx). The reason 2 tests were used to define HRRm status is because despite 
best  efforts,  the  failure  rate  of  the  tumour  tissue  gene  mutation  testing  in  prostate  cancer  is 
approximately  30%  mainly  due  to  small  and  poor-quality  tumour  tissue  samples  (Abida  et  al  2017). 
Accordingly, the tumour tissue test failure rate (31.6%) observed in PROpel was in line with what was 
observed in PROfound (31%; de Bono et al 2019) and published literature. 
Of the 796 randomised patients in PROpel, 782 patients (98.2%) provided tumour samples for analysis 
with the tumour tissue test. Of the 782 patients with samples available for analysis, 535 patients (68.4%; 
535/782)  had  a  valid  test  result  while  247  patients  (31.6%;  247/782)  failed  testing.  Adding  the  14 
patients  with  no  tumour  tissue  sample,  the  number  of  patients  with  HRRm  unknown  status  was  261 
(32.8%). In contrast to the tumour tissue test, ctDNA gene mutation test failure rate was only 7.6% and 
734 patients had a valid ctDNA test result.

In PROpel, 198 patients (24.9%) were classified with an HRRm using the ctDNA-based test compared to 
118 patients (14.8%) using the tumour tissue test. In the aggregate analysis, there were 226 patients 
(28.4%) classified as HRRm and 552 patients (69.3%) who were classified as non-HRRm leaving only 
18 patients who had no test results from either test and categorised as HRRm unknown.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: radiographic Progression Free Survival (rPFS) based on 
investigator  
The  DCO  for  the  analysis  of  rPFS  presented  in  this  CSR  (DCO1:  30  July  2021)  took  place  when  394 
progression events had occurred (49.5% of maturity), approximately 33 months after the first patient 
was randomised. For the Full analysis set (FAS), rPFS by BICR at DCO2 (14 March 2022) were provided 
during the procedure.  
The progression status based on investigator, according to RECIST 1.1 at the time of rPFS analysis is 
presented below

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup Analyses of rPFS  (baseline characteristics) 
Analyses for the primary endpoint (rPFS by investigator assessment) for 4 pre-specified subgroups were 
conducted to assess the consistency of treatment effect across potential or expected prognostic factors, 
baseline characteristics, and HRRm status. 
The global interaction test, which compares the fit of a model with no interaction terms to a model with 
all subgroup interactions included, was not significant at the 10% level (p=0.4129).

The  MTP  for  the  PROpel  study  is  based  on  analyses  at  three  DCOs. 
Radiological  PFS  analyses  at  DCO1  and  DCO2  were  planned.  As  statistical 
significance of rPFS was achieved at DCO1, formal rPFS analysis at DCO2 will 
not  be  done  and  analysis  of  this  endpoint  at  DCO2  will  be  considered 
descriptive  (with  nominal  p-values  provided).  OS  was  formally  analysed  at 
DCO1 (interim analysis), and will be at DCO2 (interim analysis), and DCO3 
(final  analysis).  DCO1  was  planned  when  approximately  379  of  the  796 
patients had an rPFS event (47.6% maturity), which was estimated to occur 
approximately 31 months after the first patient was randomised in the study. 
Actual DCO1 was set as 30 July 2021, approximately 33 months after the first 
patient was randomised, with 394 rPFS events (49.5% maturity) available at 
the  time  of  the  analysis.  DCO2  is  anticipated  to  occur  approximately  39 
months after the first patient was randomised in the study while DCO3 will 
occur approximately 48 months after the first patient is randomised, when a 
minimum follow-up of 32 months would be expected.

Supportive study - Study D081DC00008 (Study 8) 
Study  D081DC00008  (Study  8) 
is  a  Randomised,  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled, 
Multicentre Phase II Study to Compare the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Olaparib Versus 
Placebo  When  Given  in  Addition  to  Abiraterone  Treatment  in  Patients  With  Metastatic 
Castrate-Resistant  Prostate  Cancer  Who  Have  Received  Prior  Chemotherapy  Containing 
Docetaxel.  
Study 8 was a 2-part Phase II study in patients with mCRPC.  Part A was an  open-label safety run in 
study for olaparib dose selection, and to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of olaparib when given in 
addition to abiraterone 1000 mg once daily (Cohort 1, Cohort 2 group 1 and Cohort 2 group 2). Part B 
was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
the dose of olaparib selected from Part A when given in addition to abiraterone, versus placebo in addition 
to abiraterone. For the purpose of this indication, Study 8 provides supportive efficacy data which are 
provided by an all-comers population of 142 patients with mCRPC (Part B).  
Primary objective: To compare the efficacy of olaparib plus abiraterone with placebo plus abiraterone 
by assessment of rPFS using RECIST v1.1 and PCWG-2 criteria. 
Key  secondary  objectives:  To  assess  the  activity  of  olaparib  in  combination  with  abiraterone, 
compared with placebo in combination with abiraterone, by PSA, CTCs, ORR (by RECIST 1.1 and PCWG-
2 criteria) and malignant soft tissue ORR (by RECIST 1.1), DoR, TFST, TSST, OS, PFS2. To compare the 
safety and tolerability of olaparib when given in addition to abiraterone, with placebo given in addition 
to abiraterone. 
Design: Study 8 was a 2-part Phase II study in patients with mCRPC. Part A was an open-label safety 
run in study for olaparib dose selection, and to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of olaparib when 
given in addition to abiraterone 1000 mg once daily (Cohort 1, Cohort 2 group 1 and Cohort 2 group 2). 
Part  B  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  comparison  of  the  efficacy,  safety  and 
tolerability of the dose of olaparib selected from Part A when given in addition to abiraterone, versus 
placebo in addition to abiraterone. 
Patients: A total of 171 patients were enrolled in Part B, and 142 patients were randomised and received 
treatment with olaparib combined with abiraterone (n = 71) or with placebo combined with abiraterone 
(n  =  71).  Patients  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  were  generally  older  than  those  in  the 
placebo+abiraterone arm (median age of 70 years vs 67 years). With the exception of 1 patient in each 
arm who had an ECOG PS of 2, and 2 patients in the placebo+abiraterone arm with a missing status, all 
patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Median (range) baseline PSA was higher in the olaparib+abiraterone 
arm  compared  with  the  placebo+abiraterone  arm  (86.20  μg/mL  [0.2  to  3475.4  μg/mL]  versus  46.82 
μg/mL [1.4 to 3140.0 μg/mL], respectively). Patients in the olaparib+abiraterone arm had a longer mean 
time from initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to first dose compared with the placebo+abiraterone arm 
(respectively, 68.1 months and 59.5 months); the same was seen for time from most recent progression 
to  randomisation  (respectively,  67.8  days  and  53.1  days).  A  higher  incidence  of  patients  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone  arm  had  AJCC  Stage  IV  disease  at  diagnosis  compared  with 
the 
placebo+abiraterone arm (respectively, 50.7% and 38.0%).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  claimed  indication  is  lynparza  in  combination  with  abiraterone  and  prednisone  or  prednisolone 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. The 
current application is based on the results of the pivotal study PROpel. This was a Phase III, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to assess the efficacy and safety of olaparib versus 
placebo, each combined with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone, as first-line treatment for men 
with mCRPC. 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either olaparib or placebo, each combined with abiraterone 
and prednisone or prednisolone. All patients had to have evidence of histologically or cytologically 
confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma and metastatic status defined as at least one documented 
metastatic lesion on either a bone or CT/MRI scan. Patients with brain metastases were not eligible. At 
the mCRPC stage (first-line setting), patients must have no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or NHA 
treatment. Treatment with first-generation antiandrogen agents was allowed provided there was a 
washout period of 4 weeks. Treatment was continued until objective radiological disease progression 
or until patients were unable to tolerate study treatment. 
Patients were stratified by site of distant metastases (bone only, visceral, or other) and docetaxel 
treatment at mHSPC stage (yes or no). The stratification based on taxane chemotherapy would avoid 
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022 
Page 95/154 
 
 
 
 
 
heterogeneous population due to variability in the prior use of docetaxel in HSPC, which is agreed. The 
other stratification based on site of distant metastases is agreed since symptomatic and 
asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients were eligible in this trial. PROpel is an all-comers study and 
patient enrolment was not based on biomarker status (HRRm status). Eligibility criteria are considered 
acceptable according to the claimed indication. Indeed, supported by preclinical evidence (see non-
clinical section above), there are two plausible mechanisms of action with biomarkers’ independent 
activity for the olaparib-abiraterone combination explaining that biomarkers are unnecessary for the 
selection of patients. However, the stratification according to HRR mutation status was recommended 
by CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/1215/5/2018/II 20 September 2018). Exploratory analyses were performed 
based on stratification factors, baseline characteristics, and HRRm status to assess the consistency of 
treatment effect. For HRRm status, both tumour tissue and blood samples were collected at baseline 
for retrospective biomarker tests. Mutation status was determined using a ctDNA-based test 
(FoundationOne® Liquid CDx), a tumour tissue test (FoundationOne® CDx), or a germline blood test 
(Myriad myRisk).  
In PROpel, the dose of olaparib used is of 300 mg bd as tablet formulation in combination with 
abiraterone 1000 mg qd. This choice of dose was supported by safety and PK data from Study 
D081DC00008, a phase II study which evaluated olaparib in combination with abiraterone at the same 
dose in mCPRC. 
The primary endpoint was rPFS by investigator assessment in the FAS (the FAS comprises all patients 
randomised into the study and analysed according to the randomised treatment [ie, the ITT principle]) 
and the key secondary endpoint is OS. The choice of rPFS as primary endpoint instead of OS is 
acceptable despite the poor prognosis of mCRPC. A blinded, independent central review (BICR) of all 
scans used in the assessment of tumours was also conducted and used as a sensitivity analysis of the 
primary endpoint which is acceptable.  
The choice of OS as key secondary endpoint is also considered acceptable.  
A  multiple  testing  procedure  (MTP)  was  employed  across  the  primary  endpoint  of  rPFS  and  the  key 
secondary endpoint of OS to control the Type I error at 2.5% (1-sided). Following a hierarchical testing 
strategy, rPFS was tested first and then OS was tested only if statistical significance was shown for rPFS. 
The MTP for the PROpel study is based on analyses at three DCOs. Radiological PFS analyses at DCO1 
and DCO2 were planned. As statistical significance of rPFS was achieved at DCO1, formal rPFS analysis 
at  DCO2  will  not  be  done  and  analysis  of  this  endpoint  at  DCO2  will  be  considered  descriptive  (with 
nominal p-values provided). OS was formally analysed at DCO1 (interim analysis), and will be at DCO2 
(interim analysis), and DCO3 (final analysis). DCO2 is planned to be performed at ~56.9% of maturity 
while DCO3 will occur approximately 48 months after the first patient is randomised, when a minimum 
follow-up of 32 months would be expected.  
 Actual DCO1 was set as 30 July 2021, approximately 33 months after the first patient was randomised, 
with 394 rPFS events (49.5% maturity) available at the time of the analysis. Actual DCO2 was set as 14 
March 2022, with 457 rPFS events and 57.4% % of maturity.  
Sensitivity analyses were planned in the SAP: assessment of possible evaluation time bias, attrition bias, 
censoring bias, deviation bias, a sensitivity analysis using unequivocal clinical progression in addition to 
radiological  progression,  a  sensitivity  analysis  for  confirmation  of  bone  progression  and  a  sensitivity 
analysis censoring patients with subsequent therapy or discontinuation of study drug.  
The comparisons between olaparib and placebo arms associated to abiraterone for all other secondary 
endpoints (PFS2, TFST, TTPP, time to opiate use, time to SSRE, HRR gene mutation status) in this study 
were not confirmatory since no multiplicity adjustment plan was set up.

The use of abiraterone+ placebo as comparator is acceptable as recommended by ESMO in the treatment 
of  asymptomatic/mildly  symptomatic  men  with  chemotherapy-naïve  mCRPC  (Cancer  of  the  prostate: 
ESMO Clinical Practice, Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, volume 31, 25 june 2020). 
For  symptomatic  mCRPC  patients,  the  guidelines  (ESMO)  recommend  the  use  of  abiraterone  for  the 
treatment  of  mCRPC  in  adult  men  whose  disease  has  progressed  on  or  after  a  docetaxel-based 
chemotherapy regimen. For this subgroup of patients, abiraterone (in the indication claimed by the MAH) 
may be suboptimal compared to current valid therapies (chemotherapy). The indication was restricted 
to  be  in  line  with  the  recommendations  and  the  population  that  could  benefit  from  the  combination 
olaparib + abiraterone.   
The  sample  size  was  based  on  hypothesis  to  demonstrate  a  statistically  significant  difference  for  the 
primary endpoint of the study (rPFS) with 89% power at a 1-sided type 1 error rate at 2.5%, which is 
considered acceptable.  
The study was designed to provide at least 89% power to demonstrate statistically significant difference 
in rPFS at a 1-sided type 1 error rate at 2.5% if the true treatment effect was a hazard ratio (HR) of 
0.68, corresponding to an assumed increase in median rPFS from 16.5 months (placebo+abiraterone) 
to 24.3 months (olaparib+abiraterone).   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline data 
Of  the  796  patients  randomised  with  mCRPC  in  the  FAS,  70.7%  and  69.3%  were  white  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone arm compared to placebo + abiraterone arm(with a median age of 69.0 years and 
71.5% of patients were in the ≥ 65 years age group. A higher proportion of subjects ≥ 65 years old were 
randomized in placebo + abiraterone arm compared to olaparib + abirterone arm, respectively 75.6% 
and 67.4%. 
The histology (mostly adenocarcinoma), the ECOG PS at baseline (0-1) and the total Gleason Score at 
diagnosis (8-10) were globally balanced between both arms.  
The median baseline PSA was similar between both arms with respectively 17.895 µg/L and 16.805 µg/L 
in olaparib + abiraterone and placebo + abiraterone arms.  
Median times from initial diagnosis (months) were also similar among the olaparib + abiraterone and 
placebo + abiraterone arms: 33.6 months and 39.5 months, respectively.  
The most common site of disease at baseline was bone (86.4%). According to IWRS, 13.2% of patients 
had visceral metastasis. The presence of distant metastases according to TNM Classification at diagnosis 
was also well balanced between both arms with: M1: n = 143 (35.8%) for olaparib + abiraterone arm 
and n = 139 (35.0%) for placebo + abiraterone arm; M0: n = 115 (28.8%) for olaparib + abiraterone 
arm and n = 132 (32.2%) for placebo + abiraterone arm. 
Regarding the previous treatment-related disease, the majority of subjects received a treatment prior 
to mCRPC stage, 91.5% and 95.7% respectively in olaparib + abiraterone arm and placebo + abiraterone 
arm. About two-third of randomized subjects received prior hormonal therapy and were well balanced 
between both arms (75.9% in olaparib+abiraterone arm and 81.9% in placebo+abiraterone arm). Of 
these  subjects,  half  received  radiotherapy  in  the  previous  line  of  treatment  (51.6%  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone  arm  and  48.9%  in  the  placebo+abiraterone  arm),  and  one-quarter  received 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, mostly docetaxel in the mHSPC stage (90/98 in olaparib + abiraterone arm and 
89/100 in placebo + abiraterone arm). Only one subject was previously treated with second-generation 
antiandrogen prior to mCRPC stage. A total of 401/796 (50.4%) subjects received a first-antiandrogen 
agents, mostly bicalutamide (197/202 subjects).

HRR testing results 
Of note, patient enrolment in PROpel study was not based on biomarker selection. Both tumour tissue 
and blood samples were collected at baseline for retrospective biomarker tests.  
The  proportion  of  patients  with  HRR  mutations,  non  HRR  mutation  or  unknown  was  well  balanced 
between both arms, regardless of the biomarker tests. The majority of patients randomised were non-
HRRm with an incidence of 52.4% when HRRm status was based on tissue test and 67.3% based on 
ctDNA test. The incidence of HRRm patients was 14.8% when HRRm status was based on tissue test and 
24.9% based on ctDNA test. These results are consistent with the epidemiology as approximately 20% 
of  metastatic  prostate  cancers  harbour  aberrations  in  genes  involved  in  DNA  damage  and  repair 
(Robinson D, Van Allen EM, Wu YM, et al. Integrative clinical genomics of advanced prostate cancer.Cell. 
2015;161:1215e1228).  
Primary endpoint 
PROpel study met its primary endpoint with the demonstration of a statistically significative improvement 
of rPFS based on the investigator’s assessment in the FAS with a prolongation of median rPFS of 8.2 
months in favor of Olaparib+Abiraterone compared to placebo+Abiraterone at DCO1 (HR : 0.66, 95% 
0.54-0.81, p<0.0001). The sensitivity analysis of rPFS by BICR at DCO1 (HR 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.74; 
nominal p<0.0001; with median rPFS of 27.6 months in the olaparib+abiraterone arm and 16.4 months 
in the placebo+abiraterone arm) was consistent with the investigator-based analysis.  
At DCO2, a significant rPFS improvement (based on investigator’s assessment and BICR) in the olaparib 
+ abiraterone arm is reported, consistent with the data from the first interim analysis.  
Key secondary endpoint  
The  key  secondary  endpoint,  OS,  was  multiplicity  controlled.  There  is  no  statistically  significant 
improvement of OS in olaparib + abiraterone with HR of 0.86, 95% CI: 0.66-1.12.  
The  OS  HR  point  estimate  numerically  favoured  the  olaparib+abiraterone  compared  to  the 
placebo+abiraterone  arm  suggesting  a  trend  towards  improved  OS  for  olaparib+abiraterone-treated 
patients, with the KM curves separating after approximately 22 months. The median OS was not reached 
in either treatment arms.  
The MAH provided updated OS results from the second planned interim analysis (DCO2 14 March 2022). 
Median  duration  of  follow-up  for  OS  was  27.56  months  in  the  olaparib  +  abiraterone  arm  and  26.32 
months in the placebo + abiraterone arm. The OS results showed statistically 17% numerical reduction 
in the risk of death at any given point in time (HR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.03, p=0.1126). As of the 18 
months, a higher proportion of patients in the olaparib arm compared with the placebo arm remained 
alive  (18  months  [79.32%],  24  months  [70.6%],  30  months  [63.35%]  and  36  months  [57.05%] 
compared with 78.32%, 65.4%, 55.51% and 51.61% respectively). The MAH will provide the final OS 
data in overall patient population and in subgroups (by BRCAm and HRRm status) and final rPFS and OS 
Kaplan-Meier  curves  for  the  subgroups  of  BRCAm  and  non-BRCAm  patients  from  the  PROpel  study 
(D081SC00001) as a PAES and this has been reflected in Annex II of the PI. 
Other secondary endpoints 
The other efficacy endpoints are not adjusted for multiplicity.  
There  was  a  favourable  trend in  PFS2  (20.6%  maturity)  for  the  olaparib  +  placebo  arm  compared to 
placebo plus abiraterone arm with HR of 0.69, 95% CI:  0.51-0.94. Median PFS2 was not calculable for 
either treatment arms.  
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022 
Page 98/154 
 
 
 
 
TFST  data  reached  50.8%  maturity,  with  a  nominally  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful 
improvement  in  TFST  (ie,  a  delay  of  5.1  months)  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  compared  to  the 
placebo+abiraterone  arm  (HR  of  0.74,  95%  CI:  0.61-0.90;  p=0.0040);  the  median  TFST  was  25.0 
months  and  19.9  months,  respectively.  The  rate  of  patients  with  any  post-discontinuation  anticancer 
therapy was 33.1% vs. 43.6%.  The most commonly reported subsequent treatments included cytotoxic 
chemotherapy  (27.8%)  or  hormonal  therapy  (12.8%)  which  is  consistent  with  clinical  practice. 
Treatment with subsequent PARP inhibitor therapy (olaparib) occurred only for 3 patients (0.8%) in the 
placebo+abiraterone arm.  
Concerning the time to first SSRE, there was a total of 84 events (10.6%) with a numerical improvement 
in time to first SSRE in the olaparib+abiraterone arm compared to placebo+abiraterone arm with HR of 
0.72, 95% CI: 0.47-1.11 (p=0.1324).  
The median TTPP based on BPI-SF worst pain [Item 3] and opiate use has not been reached for either 
treatment  arm.  No  differences  were  demonstrated  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  compared  to  the 
placebo+abiraterone  arm.  TTPP  data  reached  13.8%  maturity  with  HR  of  1.01,  95%  CI:  0.6-1.47 
(p=0.9551). Time to opiate use for cancer-related pain data reached 11.3% maturity with HR of 1.08, 
95% CI: 0.71-1.64 (p=0.6510).  
Overall, the PROpel study met its primary endpoint and showed a favourable trend of PFS2, TFST, Time 
to first SRE for olaparib + abiraterone compared to placebo + abiraterone.  
Subgroups analysis  
Subgroup’s  analysis  of  rPFS  based  on  the  stratification  factors  did  not  reveal  an  obvious  differential 
benefit across most of the pre-defined subgroups compared with the overall population.  
Regarding subgroup analyses based on HRR status determination, these exploratory analyses did not 
show a major difference in benefit across most of the mHRR, non-HRRm and unknown HRR subgroups 
compared with the overall population. At DCO1, the subgroup gene analysis had shown that the benefit 
of olaparib is higher in HRRm compared to the other non-HRRm and HRR unknown subgroups and shown 
a  favourable  trend  of  rPFS  for  non-HRRm  and  unknown  subjects  but  the  difference  in  effect  was  not 
explained by the MAH. The applicant provided updated rPFS and OS data from DCO2 of the different 
HRR mutation subgroups and subgroup analysis in BRCAm vs non-BRCAm patients. Data results of rPFS 
and OS from DCO2 show a benefit of similar magnitude observed that DCO1. The combination olaparib 
+ abiraterone show a benefit in all HRR mutation subgroups (based on tissue test, cDNAt, aggregate 
analysis,  BRCAm  or  non-BRCAm/BRCAm  unknwown)  without  detrimental  effect  and  were  overall 
consistent with the FAS. These data, although considered with caution due to the exploratory character 
of the data as there were no control by multiplicity, demonstrate a potential benefit in the non-BRCAm/ 
BRCAm  unknown  status  and  non-HRRm/HRRm  unknown  subgroups  and do not  preclude use  in these 
subpopulations. The benefit at longer term, notably for OS, remains uncertain in non-BRCAm/non-HRRm 
patients, a PAES is requested. The MAH will provide the final OS data in overall patient population and 
in subgroups (by BRCAm and HRRm status) and final rPFS and OS Kaplan-Meier curves for the subgroups 
of BRCAm and non-BRCAm patients from the PROpel study (D081SC00001) as a PAES. Annex II of the 
SmPC has been updated. 
In PROpel study, patients should not have received any cytotoxic chemotherapy, NHA, or other systemic 
treatment (approved drugs or experimental compounds) in the mCRPC setting. Docetaxel treatment was 
allowed during neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment for localised prostate cancer and at mHSPC stage, as 
long as no signs of failure or disease progression occurred during or immediately after such treatment.  
However, despite the indication of abiraterone -which is approved for the treatment of mCRPC adult men 
who  are  asymptomatic  or  mildly  symptomatic  after  failure  of  androgen  deprivation  therapy  in  whom

chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated and in mCRPC adult men whose disease has progressed on 
or after a docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen and due to the divergence of US and EU marketing 
authorisations,  both  symptomatic  and/or  with  visceral  metastasis  and  asymptomatic  or  mildly 
symptomatic  mCRPC  patients  were  included  in  PROpel.  Therefore,  for  the  subgroup  of  patients  with 
visceral metastases and/or symptomatic disease and without docetaxel use at mHSPC stage, the choice 
of the abiraterone + placebo comparator may be suboptimal, due to the available treatment alternatives 
in this indication (chemotherapy). 
Based on the score on the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) and/or opiate use at baseline, 560 
patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease were included in PROpel, 183 patients with 
symptomatic  disease,  and  53  patients  with  missing BPI-SF  item  #3  and  no  opiate  use  at  baseline.  A 
majority  of  patients  with  asymptomatic  or  mildly  symptomatic  disease,  with  symptomatic  disease  or 
unknown  symptomatic  disease  status  did  not  receive  prior  docetaxel  treatment  at  the  mHSPC  stage 
(77%, 69.9% and 90.6%, respectively). 
RPFS subgroup analyses from DCO1 and DCO2 comparing patients with and without prior docetaxel in 
the  hormone-sensitive  disease  setting,  show  no  significant  difference  between  the  subgroups  with 
respectively  a  HR  of  0.65  (95%  CI  0.44-0.96)  and  0.71  (95%  CI  0.58-0.88)  for  the  subgroup  prior 
treated with docetaxel at mHSPC stage and with no prior docetaxel treatment. Data from rPFS based on 
investigator  assessments  in  both  subgroups  were  consistent  with  the  FAS  and  were  in  favor  of  the 
combination olaparib + abiraterone. The subgroup previously treated with docetaxel appears to have a 
better  benefit  of  the  combination  olaparib  +  abiraterone  with  a  median  rPFS  improvement  of  13.37 
months vs. approximately 8 months in the subgroup not previously treated with docetaxel at mHSPC. 
OS data were 28.6% mature at DCO1, and a trend towards improved OS in the FAS was observed for 
olaparib + abiraterone (hazard ratios [HR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66-1.12; p = 0.2923). 
At DCO2, the median follow-up of patients was approximately of 27 months and the maturity was of 
40.1%. OS HR point estimate numerically favoured the olaparib + abiraterone vs placebo + abiraterone 
arm and were consistent with the OS HR point estimate observed in FAS  with a  HR of 0.76 (95% CI 
0.50-1.15) for patients with prior treatment with docetaxel, a HR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.67-1.12) for patients 
without prior treatment with docetaxel and a HR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.66-1.03) for the FAS. 
Post-hoc  subgroup  analyses  for  efficacy  outcomes  (rPFS,  OS)  and  analysis  of  safety  profile  of  the 
association  abiraterone  +  olaparib  were  performed  in  patients  with  visceral  metastases  and/or 
symptomatic disease who had not received prior docetaxel at the mHSPC stage (at DCO2). The rPFS 
results indicated that these patients might benefit from the addition of olaparib to abiraterone: median 
rPFS  assessed  by  investigators  16.16  months  (95%CI  12.22,  20.57)  for  olaparib  combination  arm  vs 
12.29  months  (95%CI  8.11,  15.47)  for  placebo  combination  arm,  with  HR  0.62  (95%CI  0.44,  0.87). 
Median OS was 27.86 months (95%CI 22.44, NC) for olaparib combination arm vs 22.97 months (95%CI 
18.53, 32.00) for placebo combination arm, with HR 0.81 (95%CI 0.55, 1.20).  
These results are consistent with FAS and demonstrate a potential benefit of the association abiraterone 
+ olaparib for all the populations eligible, i.e. in whom the chemotherapy is not clinically indicated at 
mCRPC, regardless of symptomatic disease status or previous treatment with docetaxel in mHSPC. 
The  MAH  was  requested  to  restrict  the  indication,  to  be  in  line  with  the  recommendations  and  the 
population that could benefit from the combination, as follow:  
Lynparza is indicated in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone for the 
treatment of adult patients with mCRPC in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
PROpel  study  met  its  primary  endpoint  rPFS  with  the  demonstration  of  a  statistically  significant 
improvement in rPFS in the olaparib + abiraterone arm compared to placebo + abiraterone, which was 
supported  by  the  sensitivity  analysis  of  rPFS  by  BICR.  The  others  secondary  endpoints  (PFS2,  TFST, 
TSRE) showed a favourable trend for olaparib compared to placebo in combination with abiraterone in 
the other secondary endpoints except for the TTPP and Time to opiate use for cancer pain.    
Symptomatic and/or with visceral metastasis and asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC patients 
with  or  without  prior  docetaxel  treatment  at  mHSPC  were  included  in  PROpel.  For  the  subgroup  of 
patients  with  visceral  metastases  and/or  symptomatic  disease  and  without  docetaxel  use  at  mHSPC 
stage,  the  choice  of  the  abiraterone  +  placebo  comparator  may  be  suboptimal,  due  to  the  available 
treatment  alternatives  in  this  indication  (chemotherapy).  Post-hoc  subgroup  analyses  for  efficacy 
outcomes  (rPFS,  OS)  and  analysis  of  safety  profile  of  the  association  abiraterone  +  olaparib  were 
performed in patients with visceral metastases and/or symptomatic disease who had not received prior 
docetaxel  at  the  mHSPC  stage.  The  rPFS  results  indicated that these  patients might  benefit  from  the 
addition of olaparib to abiraterone. These results are consistent with FAS and demonstrate a potential 
benefit  of  the  association  abiraterone  +  olaparib  for  all  the  populations  eligible,  i.e.  in  whom  the 
chemotherapy is not clinically indicated at mCRPC, regardless of symptomatic disease status or previous 
treatment with docetaxel in mHSPC. 
The benefit of olaparib, in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment 
of  adult  patients  with  mCRPC  in  whom  chemotherapy  is  not  clinically  indicated  can  be  considered 
established. 
Available  data  support  a  potential  benefit  in  the  non-BRCAm/  BRCAm  unknown  status  and  non-
HRRm/HRRm unknown subgroups and do not preclude use in these subpopulations. However, the benefit 
at  longer  term,  notably  for  OS,  remains  uncertain  in  non-BRCAm/non-HRRm  patients,  a  PAES  is 
requested. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Across the entire clinical program, as of 15 June 2021, approximately 17923 patients with multiple solid 
tumors are estimated to have received treatment with olaparib across the dose range 10 mg qd to 600 
mg bd in AstraZeneca sponsored studies.  
The focus of this application is the PROpel study, in which olaparib 300 mg (or placebo) bd was given in 
combination with abiraterone as first-line therapy in patients with mCRPC.  
Supportive safety data aiming to compare safety observations between PROpel and other AstraZeneca-
sponsored studies of Olaparib are given through 2 different pools.  
The first pool concerns the association of olaparib and abiraterone (N = 469 patients) and is based on 
the PROpel study and the supportive study D081DC00008 (Study 8). The Second pool concern patients 
treated with olaparib in monotherapy: Olaparib 300mg bd pool (N = 3155). 
The 2 pools have a common DCO date of 30 July 2021 to match the PROpel interim rPFS analysis DCO 
but pooled data are based on the DCO dates for the individual studies.

a Rows are cumulative and patients were included if they had taken treatment up to that month. 
Patients ongoing treatment at study closure may not necessarily appear in the final treatment day category as total 
treatment duration differs across patients. 
Table 39: PROpel - Duration of Olaparib, Placebo and Abiraterone Exposure in each arms
a Total treatment duration = (last dose date - first dose date + 1).b Actual treatment duration = (last dose date - 
first dose date + 1) excluding dose interruptions.c Abiraterone for patients that received olaparib.d Abiraterone for 
patients that received placebo. 
Proportion of patients with treatment interruptions and dose reductions was higher in Olaparib than in 
placebo in their respective arms (47.0% versus 29.8% and 22.9% versus 7.3% respectively for dose 
reductions and for treatment interruption (Table 65-66).  
Assessment report

In both arms, AE was the most common reason for treatment interruption of olaparib/placebo (39.5% 
olaparib+abiraterone  arm  and  19.7% 
in  placeo+abiraterone  arm)  and  dose  reductions  of 
olaparib/placebo (18.6% olaparib+abiraterone arm versus 4.3% in placeo+abiraterone arm).  
Median  relative  dose  intensity  (percentage  of  the  actual  dose  delivered  relative  to  the  intended  dose 
through to treatment discontinuation) were similar and were >98% in both treatment arms, suggesting 
that dose intensity was not affected by dose modifications. 
The median total duration of exposure to abiraterone was 1.2 times longer in the olaparib+abiraterone 
arm  (555.0  days  [18.2  months])  than  in  the  placebo+abiraterone  arm  (477.0  days  [15.7  months]) 
(Table 37). Combination treatment with olaparib does not appear to reduce the planned administration 
of abiraterone. 
Overall extent of exposure: pools for comparison 
Olaparib and abiraterone pool 
Exposure to the combination of olaparib 300 mg bd and abiraterone 1000 mg qd in mCRPC concerned 
398 patients in the PROpel study and 71 patients in study 8 (supportive study). Thus, pooled data 
concerned N = 469 patients. This pool provides data for long-term exposure to this treatment 
association (up to 2 years [24 months]).  
As shown in Table 38, compared with the olaparib arm of PROpel, the distribution of cumulative exposure 
to olaparib was largely similar though there was a lowest proportion of patients remaining on olaparib in 
the  olaparib  and  abiraterone  pool  at  6,  12,  and  18  months.  Consistentlythe  median  total  duration  of 
exposure to olaparib was longer in the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel (531.5 days [17.5 months]; 
Table 39) than in the olaparib and abiraterone pool (480.0 days [15.8 months]). 
Olaparib 300 mg bd pool 
Patients  in  this  pool  received  the  same  dose  and  formulation  of  olaparib  as  patients  in  olaparib  and 
abiraterone pool (PROpel + study D081DC00008).  
As shown in Table 36 data were pooled from 19 studies with a total of 3155 patients with solid tumours, 
including 267 patients who had prostate cancer. Among these 19 studies, 8 are phase III studies, 2 are 
phase II studies and 9 are phase I studies. This pool provides data for long-term exposure to olaparib 
300 bd as a monotherapy (up to 72 months).

a The patients in the China cohorts of SOLO1 and SOLO2 were reported separately to the main clinical study 
reports for these studies. 
As shown in Table 36, compared with the Olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel, the proportion of patients 
remaining on olaparib was lowest in the Olaparib 300 mg bd pool at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, with 
the  largest  difference  observed  at  12  months  and  18  months.  A  small  proportion  of  patients  in  the

olaparib 300 mg bd pool remained on olaparib at 36, 48, 60, and 72 months. Consistent with that, the 
median  total  duration  of  exposure  to  olaparib  was  longer  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  of  PROpel 
(531.5 days [17.5 months];Table 37) than in the olaparib 300 mg bd pool (336.0 days [11.0 months]).  
Demographics 
PROpel and study 8 
The demographic and disease characteristics of patients in PROpel and study 8 were summarised in the 
efficacy  part.  Demographic  data  for  patients  in  these  2  studies  have  not  been  pooled,  as  the  studies 
were in patients with different prior anticancer treatment status. 
Olaparib 300 mg bd pool 
Demographic data of studies contributing to the olaparib 300 mg bd pool have not been pooled, as the 
studies  were  in  different  patient  populations  of  varying  stages  of  disease.  Summaries  of  the  key 
demographic and baseline patient characteristics for the 19 studies contributing to the pooled dataset 
are provided in Table 39. 
It  is  important  to  note  that  these  data  are  for  all  patients  in  these  studies  and  not  just  those  in  the 
olaparib 300 mg bd tablet dose cohorts. The primary tumour location of most patients in the olaparib 
300 mg bd pool was breast (40.9%) and ovary (36.2%). Patients with other primary tumour locations, 
including prostate (8.5%), pancreas (3.2%), fallopian tube (2.6%), and primary peritoneal (2.1%), were 
also treated in these studies.  
Compared with other studies in the olaparib 300 mg bd pool and especially the Phase III PROfound in 
mCRPC,  differences  were  observed  in  baseline  characteristics.  A  higher  proportion  of  patients  in 
PROfound study had a ECOG PS score ≥1 (restricted activity) and all patients were pre-treated. Whereas, 
few patients were pre-treated in PROpel, though most of patient in study 8 were pre-treated.  
Mean age beetween PROpel, Study 8 and PRofound were similar. However, globaly in the Olaparib 300 
mg bd pool, patients were younger than in the Olaparib and Abiraterone pool and mostly composed of 
female. In addition to these demographics differences, a majority of patients were HRD (BRCA mutated 
or  others)  whereas  patients  in  PROpel  were  included  regardless  of  the  HRR  status  and  roughly  the 
majority of patients with known HRR status were HRR non-mutated in both arms.

In the olaparib+abiraterone arm, the most common AEs, reported at an incidence ≥ 15%, were anaemia, 
nausea,  fatigue,  constipation,  diarrhoea,  and  back  pain.  In  the  placebo+Abiraterone  arm,  they  were 
fatigue, back pain, arthralgia, hypertension, and anaemia.  
All  AEs  of  constipation  were  classed  as  low  grade  (CTCAE  Grade  1  or  2),  and  none  were  classed  as 
serious. The imbalance between treatment arms for constipation was smaller on taking exposure into 
account. Back pain was observed at a similar incidence in both arms.  
Adjusting for treatment exposure did not notably change the differences in AE incidences between arms. 
Adverse  events  reported  at  an  incidence  ≥  2%  lower  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  than  in  the 
placebo+abiraterone arm were diabetes mellitus, arthralgia, hypertension, hot flush, ALT increased, and 
AST increased. These terms are ADRs of abiraterone, except for hot flush and arthralgia. 
Adverse  events  reported  at  an  incidence  ≥  2%  greater  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  than  in  the 
placebo+abiraterone arm that are not previously known ADRs for olaparib are described below: 
Due  to  disease:  constipation,  muscle  spasms,  contusion,  weight  decreased,  dry  skin,  dehydration, 
palpitations,  bone  pain,  and  neck  pain  are  considered  symptoms  commonly  reported  in  a  mCRPC 
population. The majority of these AEs were Grade 1 or 2. 
Due  to  treatment  with  Abiraterone:  urinary  tract  infection,  hypokalaemia,  atrial  fibrillation,  and 
electrocardiogram  QT  prolonged  are  ADRs  for  abiraterone.  Although  numerical  imbalances  were 
observed for these terms, the observed rates are still consistent with labelled frequency for abiraterone. 
COVID-19 (COVID-19, suspected COVID-19, and COVID-19 pneumonia) 
Newly identified ADR for Olaparib was Pulmonary embolism. This new ADR is discussed in the serious 
adverse event section.   
Comparison of PROpel with pools 
In the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel, the most common AEs, reported at an incidence ≥ 15%, 
were anaemia, nausea, fatigue, constipation, diarrhoea, and back pain. In the Olaparib 300 mg bd pool, 
they  were  nausea,  fatigue,  anaemia,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  decreased  appetite,  headache,  and 
constipation  (  Table  41).  These  AEs  are  mostly  consistent  with  the  ADR  profiles  of  olaparib  and 
Abiraterone  monotherapies.  Constipation  and  back  pain  were  most  likely  reported  due  to  underlying 
disease.  In  general,  the  most  common  events  with  olaparib  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  and 
resolved on continued treatment. 
AEs  (>  5%  incidence  in  either  arm/pool)  reported  at  an  incidence  >  2%  greater  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone  arm  in  PROpel  than  in  the  olaparib  300  mg  bd  pool  were  anaemia,  back  pain, 
hypertension, oedema peripheral, hot flush, urinary tract infection, musculoskeletal chest pain, muscle 
spasms,  hyperglycaemia,  lymphocyte  count  decreased,  hypokalaemia,  COVID-19,  fall,  blood  alkaline 
phosphatase  increased,  contusion,  weight  decreased,  pulmonary  embolism,  and  lymphopenia.  Events 
reported at an incidence > 2% lower in the olaparib+abiraterone arm in PROpel than in the olaparib 300 
mg bd pool were fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, decreased appetite, cough, headache, pyrexia, 
dyspepsia,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  abdominal  pain,  white  blood  cell  count  decreased, 
dysgeusia, nasopharyngitis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophil count decreased, and stomatitis.  
The  differences  in  incidence  of  these  AEs,  which  are  mostly  ADRs  for  olaparib  or  Abiraterone 
monotherapy, may be attributed to differences in patient population between PROpel and the olaparib 
300 mg bd pool.  
Table 44 summarize the most common AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 with an incidence > 1% in either arm 
of propel, the olaparib and abiraterone pool, or the olaparib 300 mg bd pool.

Comparison of PROpel with pools 
AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the Olaparib+abiraterone arm of 
PROpel than in the olaparib 300 mg bd pool (Table 42), as discussed in the Overview of AEs Section.In 
the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel, the most common AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3, reported in ≥ 2% 
of patients, were anaemia, pulmonary embolism, hypertension, lymphocyte count decreased, COVID-
19, neutrophil count decreased, and urinary tract infection. In the olaparib 300 mg bd pool, they were 
anaemia, neutrophil count decreased, neutropenia, and fatigue. 
AEs  of  CTCAE  Grade  ≥  3  reported  at  an  incidence  >  1%  greater  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  of 
PROpel  than  in  the  olaparib  300  mg  bd  pool  were  COVID-19,  pneumonia,  urinary  tract  infection, 
lymphopenia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and 
lymphocyte count decreased. Events reported at an incidence > 1% lower in the olaparib+abiraterone 
arm of PROpel than in the olaparib 300 mg bd pool were neutropenia and fatigue. 
Adverse drug reaction for Abiraterone 
Abiraterone ADRs reported at an incidence > 2% greater in the olaparib and abiraterone pool than in 
the  placebo  and  abiraterone  pool  were  embolic  and  thrombotic  events,  venous  (SMQ),  Cardiac 
arrhythmia  terms  (including  bradyarrhythmia  and  tachyarrhythmias)  (SMQ),  Torsades  de  pointes/QT 
prolongation (SMQ), and hypokalaemia (grouped term). Although numerical imbalances were observed 
between  the  pools  in  the  incidence  of  cardiac  arrhythmia,  Torsades  de  pointes/QT  prolongation,  and 
hypokalaemia, the rates were still consistent with the labelled frequency for abiraterone. 
Table 45 summarizes the incidence of abiraterone ADRs in the olaparib and abiraterone pool, and the 
placebo and abiraterone pool.

PROpel 
Serious  AEs  were  reported  in  a  higher  proportion  for  olaparib+abiraterone-treated  patients  than 
placebo+abiraterone-treated patients (Table 46). 
In the olaparib+abiraterone arm, the most common SAEs, reported at an incidence ≥ 2%, were anaemia, 
pulmonary  embolism,  COVID-19,  pneumonia,  and  urinary  tract  infection.  In  the  placebo+abiraterone 
arm, this was COVID-19. 
Serious  AEs  reported  at  an  incidence  >  1%  greater  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  than  in  the 
placebo+abiraterone arm were urinary tract infection, anaemia, and pulmonary embolism. Urinary tract 
infection is a known ADR for abiraterone, and anaemia is a known ADR for olaparib. Pulmonary embolism 
is  a  newly  identified  ADR  for  Olaparib.  No  events  were  reported  at  an  incidence  >  1%  lower  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone arm than in the placebo+abiraterone arm. 
Venous Thromboembolism 
VTE was identified as a new ADR for Olaparib.  
Across the entire clinical programme an imbalance of VTEs disfavouring the olaparib treatment arm has 
been noted in PROfound, PROpel and PAOLA-1 studies. Although the incidence and event rate of VTEs 
are lower in other monotherapy studies, there is a slightly higher incidence of VTEs in the olaparib arms 
in SOLO2 and SOLO1. 
Although  most  emboli  are  thought  to  arise  from  lower  extremity  proximal  veins,  pelvic  or  abdominal 
veins, the frequency of VTEs was low. In general, the VTEs reported from these clinical studies did not 
report any additional confounders (other than the presence of advanced cancer and concurrent treatment 
with  androgen  deprivation  treatments  or  bevacizumab)  and  showed  no  pattern  in  time  to  onset.  No

apparent  baseline  imbalance  can  be  noted  relating  to  baseline  risk  factors  that  would  explain  the 
observed imbalances. 
In PROpel, a higher proportion of venous thromboembolism, mostly pulmonary embolism, was reported 
in the Olaparib+Abiraterone arm than in the placebo+Abiraterone arm (Table 47). Others VTEs included 
deep vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis and thrombophlebitis superficial.  
VTE were mostly grade ≥ 3 in both arms, less than half of the cases were serious including 1 outcome 
of  death  in  the  Olaparib+Abiraterone  arm.  In  few  cases,  VTE  resulted  in  dose  interruption  of 
Olaparib/placebo. However, no dose reduction in either arms and only 1 treatment discontinuation in the 
placebo+Abiraterone arm were reported (Table 47).

more than one category are counted once in each of those categories. Includes AEs with an onset date, or worsening,

Pulmonary embolism was the most severe and most frequent AE among VTEs AE. All the olaparib dose 
interruption  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  were  due  to  pulmonary  embolism.  Pulmonary  embolism 
was reported as causally related by the investigator in 7 patients (1.8%) in the olaparib+abiraterone 
arm.  All  pulmonary  embolism  events  were  reported  as  CTCAE  Grade  ≥  3,  in  accordance  with  CTCAE 
version 4.03, whereby any pulmonary embolism is categorised as Grade ≥ 3. In the olaparib+abiraterone 
arm, the majority of patients who developed pulmonary embolism recovered or were recovering (17 of 
26 patients) from the event at the time of DCO and 8 patients had not recovered. One patient in the 
olaparib+abiraterone  arm  had  an  AE  of  pulmonary  embolism  with  fatal  outcome.  The  investigator 
considered the event to be unrelated to olaparib and Abiraterone. 
The median time to onset of pulmonary embolism was similar between the treatment arms (209 and 
248  days  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  and  placebo+abiraterone  arms,  respectively).  The  majority  of 
pulmonary  embolism  AEs  were  detected  incidentally  on  radiographic  imaging  in  both  treatment  arms 
(69.2% and 71.4% in the olaparib+abiraterone and placebo+Abiraterone arm, respectively).  
In  either  arm  of  PROpel  there  were  confounding  factors  that  could  explain  pulmonary  embolism  AEs 
including immobilisation, hospitalisation due to appendicitis, and hip fracture in the placebo+abiraterone 
arm (3 patients in the placebo+abiraterone arm), and previous immobilisation and history of pulmonary 
embolism or other VTEs prior to starting study treatment in the olaparib+abiraterone arm (7 patients). 
None of the patients with history of VTEs in the olaparib+abiraterone arm (4 patients) were on long term 
anticoagulant  treatment  prior  to  developing  pulmonary  embolism.  Overall,  considering  baseline  risk

factors,  there  was  a  slightly  higher  number  of  patients  who  had  a  history  of  VTEs  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone arm, compared to the placebo+abiraterone arm. 
In Study 8, the frequency of VTE events was low: pulmonary embolism was reported in 2 patients (2.8%) 
in the olaparib+abiraterone arm, and pulmonary embolism and thrombosis were reported in 1 patient 
(1.4%) each in the placebo+abiraterone arm 
Comparison of PROpel with pools 
Serious AEs occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel than 
in the olaparib 300 mg bd pool. 
In the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel study, the most common SAEs, reported in ≥ 2% of patients, 
were anaemia, pulmonary embolism, COVID-19, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. In the olaparib 
300 mg bd pool, this was anaemia. 
Serious AEs reported at an incidence > 1% greater in the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel than in 
the olaparib 300 mg bd pool were COVID-19, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, urosepsis, anaemia, 
and  pulmonary  embolism.  No  SAEs  were  reported  at  an  incidence  >  1%  lower  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel than in the olaparib 300 mg bd pool. 
Deaths  
PROpel 
The majority of reported deaths in both arms were attributed by the investigator to progression of the 
disease  under  investigation.  The  incidence  of  AEs  with  outcome  of  death  was  balanced  between 
treatment arms. (Table 48)

Olaparib and Abiraterone Pool 
Important potential risks for Olaparib 
Pneumonitis and New Primary Malignanices (NPM) other than MDS/AML have been classified in the RMP 
as important potential risks.  
Since pneumonitis and NPMs occur at low frequency, to improve the sensitivity and precision of estimates 
to characterise these important potential risks, information has been drawn from larger pools of olaparib 
studies, in addition to PROpel. To gain a complete clinical picture of patients with uncommon events that 
are important potential risks for olaparib, information from multiple data sources was used.  
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022 
Page 122/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Generally, where the events were reported as SAEs, they were recorded on both the clinical database (a 
validated database that was locked for the purpose of the study analysis) and the AstraZeneca Patient 
Safety database (a ‘live’ database, with data subject to change as new information is provided to the 
data entry site). 
Some reports are taken from the AstraZeneca Patient Safety database where events occurred after the 
end of the safety follow-up period for a given patient, after the DCO for an ongoing study or after study 
closure.  These  reports  are  supplemented  with  demography,  baseline  medical  history,  AE  and  clinical 
laboratory data from the clinical database. 
New Primary Malignancies 
For the majority of studies with olaparib, reports for events of NPM continue to be collected beyond 30 
days after the last dose of olaparib; investigators are asked during the regular follow-up for OS if the 
patient had developed an NPM and prompted to report any cases to the Sponsor.  
Considering the different risk characteristics, more favourable outcome, and the difficulty in estimating 
true background incidence rates of non-melanoma skin cancers, these cases have been excluded from 
the  analysis  of  NPM  cases.  Non-melanoma  skin  cancers  have  distinct  risk  factors,  such  as  ultraviolet 
light,  ionising  radiation,  immunosuppression,  and  their  incidence  is  influenced  by  geographic  factors, 
age, and ethnicity. No direct mechanism has been described to link PARP inhibition to the occurrence of 
basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell skin cancer. Non-melanoma skin cancers tend to have a better 
outcome when diagnosed early, compared to malignant melanoma. 
PROpel 
Adverse events in the SOC ‘Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified’ were reported for 23 patients 
in the olaparib+abiraterone arm versus 18 in the placebo+abiraterone arm.  
NPMs were identified by review of this SOC, to exclude PTs relating to cancer or tumour pain, benign 
events, and events of squamous cell skin cancer, Bowen’s disease, basal cell carcinoma, and external 
ear neoplasm malignant (reported as ‘Squamous Cell Carcinoma Left ear pinna [skin]’). Events with a 
date of onset on treatment, or during and after the 30-day safety follow up period are included in the 
summary of new primary malignancies.  
In PROpel, NPMs were reported in 12 patients (3.0%) in the olaparib+abiraterone arm and 10 patients 
(2.5%) in the placebo+abiraterone arm (Table 50).

Of the 44 AEs (reported in 42 patients) in the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose pool, 
the reported malignancies were breast cancers (n = 18), GI cancers (n = 8), thyroid cancer (n = 4), 
lung  cancer  (n  =  3),  malignant  melanoma  (n  =  2),  plasma  cell  myeloma,  Burkitt  lymphoma,  bladder

and/or oral cavity cancer, endometrial adenocarcinoma, and lymphoma (n = 1 each). Of the 42 patients 
in the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose pool with NPMs, 35 patients had a documented 
BRCA mutation, 3 patients were gBRCAwt and in 4 patients, the BRCA mutation status was unknown. 
All patients in the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose pool had other potential factors that 
offer alternative explanations for the development of the NPM, such as: a history of smoking, alcohol

consumption or exposure to strong sunlight; a documented breast cancer gene (BRCA1 or 2) mutation; 
a  medical  history  of  previous  cancers;  exposure  to  previous  chemotherapy  agents  including  multiple 
cycles  of  platinum  containing  chemotherapies  that  are  known  DNA-damaging  agents  and  taxanes, 
anthracyclines and other alkylating and DNA-damaging agents; and prior radiotherapy.  
Among  the  entire  clinical  development,  NPM  was  reported  in  115  over  17923  patients  (incidence  of 
0.6%).  There  have  also  been  reports  of  NPM  from  post-marketing  surveillance,  consistent  with  the 
characterisation of the events reported from monotherapy clinical studies. 
Pneumonitis 
Adverse  events  of  pneumonitis  are  routinely  collected  on-treatment  and  during  the  30-day  follow-up 
period only per protocol; pneumonitis AEs are not actively solicited beyond the end of the 30-day follow 
up period. 
PROpel 
From the start of PROpel (first patient randomised 08 November 2018) up to the DCO of 30 July 2021, 
pneumonitis was reported at similar incidence between both arms, that incidence being of 0.8%. 
Pooled data from Olaparib clinical programme 
Table 52 shows the AEs of pneumonitis in PROpel compared with other studies in the clinical 
programme and provides incidence rates. When larger populations of olaparib-treated patients are 
considered, the incidence is approximately 1%. 
Table 53: Summary of AEs of Pneumonitis Occurring Across the Olaparib Programme 
Pneumonitis has been reported in 0.9% of patients treated with olaparib in clinical studies in the olaparib 
monotherapy  combined  therapeutic  dose  pool  (Table  52).  Considering  the  entire  olaparib  clinical 
programme  122  case  reports  have  been  received  up  to  15  June  2021  (crude  incidence  122/17923; 
0.7%). Overall, the majority of pneumonitis AEs reported in the olaparib monotherapy therapeutic dose 
pool  were  mild  or  moderate,  non-serious,  and  resolved  without  treatment  discontinuation.  Although 
there  were  slightly  higher  rates  reported  in  patients  receiving  olaparib  in  SOLO1,  SOLO2,  and  POLO, 
these  studies  were  designed  with  a  2:1  randomisation  and  the  exposure  (and  therefore  observation 
time) on the olaparib arm was longer, which could potentially explain the observed difference.

Haematological Toxicities  
Anaemia  
Anaemia  is  the  most  common  haematological  effect  reported  with  olaparib  treatment.  The  proposed 
product information includes anaemia as an adverse reaction of olaparib therapy.  
The majority of AEs of anaemia were mild or moderate in severity. Onset was early with a median time 
to first onset of 1.89 months in the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel. The risk of developing anaemia 
remained constant from around 3 months of treatment, with no evidence of cumulative effect. AEs of 
anaemia were manageable by interrupting or reducing the olaparib dose or giving blood transfusions or 
growth factors in accordance with local practice. Regarding the resolution a total of 53% of patients in 
the olaparib+abiraterone arm who had an AE of anaemia had a first event with a resolution date. The 
median time to resolution for a first event in the olaparib+abiraterone arm was 4.19 months.  
In  PROpel,  anaemia  events  any  grade,  of  CTCAE  Grade  ≥   3  severity  (though  no  CTCAE  Grade  4 
haemoglobin values were reported in either treatment arm), SAEs and events leading to discontinuation, 
dose  reduction,  or  interruption  of  olaparib/placebo  occurred  in  a  higher  proportion  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone-treated  patients  compared  to  the  placebo+abiraterone-treated  patients  (Table 
53). Given that, a higher proportion were treated for the AE in the olaparib+abiraterone arm (34.1%) 
than in the placebo+abiraterone arm (21.5%). A total of 15.6% of patients in the olaparib+abiraterone 
arm received at least one blood transfusion, compared to 3.8% of patients in the placebo+abiraterone 
arm. Proportion of patients in PROpel requiring treatment for anaemia was consistent with the proportion 
of patients with CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 AEs of anaemia. 
The overall incidence of anaemia was higher in the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel (46%) than in 
the olaparib 300 mg bd pool (35.2%) Table 53). The high proportion of bone metastases (87.5%) might 
have contributed to the observed higher overall incidence of anaemia in the olaparib+abiraterone arm 
of  PROpel.  Across  AE  categories,  the  incidence  and  severity  of  anaemia  events  following 
olaparib+abiraterone treatment in PROpel were consistent with the known safety profile of Olaparib.

Neutropenia, Thromvytopenia, Lymphopenia, Leukopenia 
The  incidence  of  other  haematological  AEs  associated  with  olaparib  such  as  the  grouped  terms 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and lymphopenia were low in PROpel (all < 15%). These 
events are known ADRs for olaparib and were reported with a higher incidence in olaparib+abiraterone-
treated  patients  compared  to  the  placebo+abiraterone-treated  patients.  These  events  were 
predominantly  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  in  severity,  were  manageable  by  using  a  combination  of 
olaparib  dose  modification  and  supportive  therapies,  resolved  whilst  on  treatment  and  rarely  led  to 
permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
In  PROpel,  AEs  of  neutropenia  were  more  common  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  than  in  the 
placebo+abiraterone  arm.  Events  of  CTCAE  Grade  ≥  3  severity  occurred  in  a  higher  proportion  of 
olaparib+abiraterone-treated patients than placebo+abiraterone-treated patients. 
The  AE  category  tables  below  show  consistent  pattern  though  slight  differences  in  proportion  of 
neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  lymphopenia,  and  leukopenia  AEs  between  PROpel  and  the  Olaparib

and the olaparib 300 mg bd pool.

Myelodysplastic Syndrome/acute Myeloid Leukaemia  
MDS/AML is an ADR for olaparib treatment (following the evaluation of the results of the SOLO2 study). 
MDS/AML is considered an AESI and an important identified risk for olaparib and events are collected 
beyond  the  30-day  safety  follow-up  for  the  duration  of  the  survival  follow-up.  A  summary  of  AEs  of 
MDS/AML occurring in PROpel (DCO = 30 July 2021) together with cases in other pivotal studies, in the 
olaparib and abiraterone pool, the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose pool, and across 
the entire clinical programme (DCO = 15 June 2021) is shown in Table 58.

General disorders  
Fatigue and Asthenia 
Fatigue and asthenia have both been identified as ADRs with olaparib treatment. In general, reported 
events  of  fatigue  and  asthenia  for  olaparib  monotherapy  treatment  are  mild  or  moderate  in  severity, 
chronic in nature, but rarely lead to treatment discontinuation. Dose interruption or reduction are rarely 
required; some events resolve whilst on treatment. 
In  PROpel,  AEs  of  fatigue  and  asthenia  were  reported  for  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the 
Olaparib+abiraterone  arm  than  in  the  placebo+abiraterone  arm.  The  proportion  of  events  that  were 
CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 in severity was low in both arms (Table 59). Onset of fatigue and asthenia was early, 
with median time to first onset of 1.84 months in the olaparib+abiraterone arm 
Notably, AEs of fatigue and asthenia occurred at a lower incidence in the olaparib+abiraterone arm of 
PROpel than in the olaparib 300 mg bd pool despite the combined therapy and the older population of

PROpel patients compared to the patients in the Olaparib 300 mg bd pool. The risk of developing fatigue 
and asthenia remained constant from around 3 months of treatment, with no evidence of cumulative 
effect.  A  total  of  34.7%  of  patients  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  who  had  an  AE  of  fatigue  and 
asthenia had a first event with a resolution date. The median time to resolution was 5.13 months for a 
first event in the olaparib+abiraterone arm.

Gastro-intestinal  
Nausea and Vomiting 
Nausea and vomiting have both been identified as ADRs with olaparib treatment. In general, reported 
events of nausea and vomiting for olaparib treatment are mild or moderate in severity, rarely lead to 
treatment discontinuation, are manageable, and resolve whilst on treatment. 
Adverse  events  of  nausea  and  vomiting  were  reported  for  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone arm than in the placebo+abiraterone arm. Nearly all events were CTCAE Grade ≤ 
2 in severity and not serious.  
Adverse events of nausea and vomiting overall and leading to interruption of olaparib occurred at a lower 
incidence in the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel than in the olaparib 300 mg bd pool.

Abiraterone ADRs reported at an incidence > 2% greater in the olaparib and abiraterone pool than in 
the  placebo  and  abiraterone  pool  were  Embolic  and  thrombotic  events,  venous  (SMQ),  Cardiac 
arrhythmia  terms  (including  bradyarrhythmia  and  tachyarrhythmias)  (SMQ),  Torsades  de  pointes/QT 
prolongation  (SMQ),  and  hypokalaemia  (grouped  term).  Except  for  AEs  reported  in  the  Embolic  and 
thrombotic events, venous SMQ (CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs of VTEs were reported in a higher percentage of 
patients in the olaparib+abiraterone arm [5.8%] compared with the placebo+abiraterone arm [1.7%]), 
AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥3 were reported in a similar percentage of patients in both treatment arms.  
The observed imbalance in venous embolic and thrombotic events is further discussed in Section “Serious 
adverse event” of this report and VTE is now identified as a new ADRs for Olaparib.  
Although numerical imbalances were observed between the pools in the incidence of cardiac arrhythmia, 
Torsades de pointes/QT prolongation, and hypokalaemia, the rates were still consistent with the labelled 
frequency for abiraterone.  
One abiraterone ADR was reported at an incidence > 2% lower in the olaparib and abiraterone pool than 
in the placebo and abiraterone pool: hypertension.

Following  the  DBL  for  PROpel,  no  new  ADRs  for  abiraterone  were  observed,  nor  did  the  combination 
treatment appear to increase the known ADRs of abiraterone. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
No additional safety concern for olaparib was identified in the haematology data from PROpel. 
Changes in the laboratory values for the haematology parameters of haemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets, 
and lymphocytes are considered adverse drugs reactions (ADRs) for olaparib and are presented in the 
hemalogical  toxicity  section  of  identified  AEs.  The  number  and  proportion  of  patients  with  maximum 
overall CTCAE grades during treatment for selected haematology values in PROpel are shown in Table

Clinical chemistry 
No additional safety concern for olaparib was identified in the clinical chemistry data from PROpel. 
A summary of maximum  overall CTCAE grade during treatment for key clinical chemistry parameters 
(creatinine,  bilirubin,  ALT,  AST,  and  ALP)  is  presented  in  Table  62.  Changes  in  clinical  chemistry 
parameters were generally mild or moderate and transient. In the majority of patients, the maximum 
CTCAE Grade was 0, 1, or 2 in both treatment arms. The proportion of patients with Grade 3 or 4 values

a Patients with a baseline value and at least one on-treatment value. Percentages have been calculated using the 
number of patients with a baseline value and a post-baseline value.  
b Includes assessments on or after the date of first dose and up to and including 30 days following the date of last 
dose of randomised treatment. For magnesium, potassium, and sodium, is the maximum CTCAE grade (low/high) - 
patients with no low/high graded assessments during treatment are excluded.  
c CTCAE grades can worsen in 2 directions; low and high are associated with hypo and hyper directional shifts, 
respectively. 
Inogram  
No clinically meaningful difference between the 2 treatment arms was observed for change from baseline 
in CTCAE grades for potassium, magnesium, or sodium. 
Increase in Creatinine  
Mild elevations in serum creatinine have been observed without any apparent clinical sequelae and renal 
impairment. The onset was rapid with a return to baseline after olaparib discontinuation. These data are 
Altogether this informations are consistent with the finding that olaparib is known to be an inhibitor of 
OCT2 and MATE1.  
In PROpel, AEs of increased creatinine were reported for a similar proportion of patients in both treatment 
arms  except  for  grade  2  that  was  higher  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  compared  to  the 
placebo+abiraterone  arm  (respectively,  16.4%  and  8.6%).  There  were  no  CTCAE  Grade  4  or  serious 
events in either treatment arm.  
Noteworthy, no renal safety concerns were identified from a review of laboratory and AE data. There is 
no evidence to suggest that olaparib impairs renal function. 
Assessment of the Potential for Drug-induced Liver Injury 
Both ALT increased and AST increased are ADRs for abiraterone. No hepatobiliary safety concerns were 
identified  from  a  review  of  laboratory  and  AE  data  in  PROpel.  There  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that 
olaparib causes DILI. Two cases of DILI were reported, both in the placebo+abiraterone arm. One was 
a  confirmed  Hy’s  law  case,  attributed  to  abiraterone.  The  other  was  a  potential  Hy’s  law  case  (with 
choledocholithiasis as an alternative explanation for the elevated liver function test results), considered 
unrelated to placebo and abiraterone. 
A lower proportion of olaparib+abiraterone-treated patients in PROpel (3.8%) had hepatic metastases 
at baseline compared with Study 8 (5.6%) and with olaparib-treated patients in most of the studies that 
contributed most of the safety data for the olaparib 300 mg bd: PROfound (9.8%), OlympiAD (38.5%), 
SOLO1 (5.0%), OPINION (8.6%), SOLO3 (12.4%), SOLO2 (13.8%), and LIGHT (7.0%). 
Laboratory abnormalities for ALT and AST  
At baseline, the proportion of patients with ALT or AST values of CTCAE Grade ≥ 1 was similar and low 
in PROpel (75 patients; 19%), the olaparib and abiraterone pool (82 patients; 17.4%), and the olaparib 
300 mg bd pool (629 patients; 20.1%). 
The proportion of patients with maximum on-treatment combined AST or ALT ≤ 3 × ULN was similar and 
high in the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel, the olaparib and abiraterone pool, and the olaparib 300 
mg bd pool. (Table 63)

Percentages are calculated out of the number of patients with ALT or AST values during continuous treatment 
phase. 
Derived from laboratory assessments between the start of continuous treatment and 30 days following the date of 
last dose of continuous treatment. 
The  incidence  of  CTCAE  Grade  ≥   3  elevations  for  ALT  and  AST  was  similar  and  low  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel (1.8% and 0.8% respectively), the olaparib and abiraterone pool 
(1.5%  and  0.9%  respectively),  and  the  olaparib  300  mg  bd  pool  (1.3%  and  1.5%  respectively).  The 
incidence in the placebo+abiraterone arm of PROpel was higher than in the olaparib+abiraterone arm 
and  both  pools  (5.6%  and  4.1%  respectively).  Consistent  with  that,  the  proportion  of  patients  with 
CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 AEs of ALT or AST increased was similar and low in the olaparib+abiraterone arm of 
PROpel (1.0% and 0.5% respectively), the olaparib and abiraterone pool (0.9% and 0.6% respectively), 
and the olaparib 300 mg bd pool (0.7% and 0.6% respectively). A higher proportion was observed in 
the placebo+abiraterone arm of PROpel (2.3% and 1.0% respectively).  
Concomitant elevations of ALT/AST and bilirubin  
No concurrent elevations of AST or ALT > 3  × ULN and total bilirubin >2 ×  ULN, irrespective of ALP, 
were observed in the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel. Cases meeting these criteria were uncommon 
in  the  placebo+abiraterone  arm  of  PROpel  (2  patients  [0.5%]),  the  olaparib  and  abiraterone  pool  (1 
patient [0.2%]), and the olaparib 300 mg bd pool (28 patients [0.9%]). 
Safety in special populations 
As PROpel have not been conduct in specials population such as pregnant or breast feading women 
and hepatic or renal impaired patients, no new data are available for these special populations. 
The olaparib and abiraterone pool and the olaparib 300 mg bd pool have been used as the data 
sources for this section, rather than PROpel.  
Effect of gender 
As  all  patients  in  PROpel  were  male,  an  analysis  of  the  effects  of  gender  has  been  conducted  in  the 
olaparib 300 mg bd pool.  
Owing to the imbalance in the number of male and female patients, differences between genders should 
be interpreted with caution. In addition, it should be noted that 256 of the 410 male patients had mCRPC 
and were recruited in the PROfound study. The mean age of the male patients in the PROfound study 
was  68.6  years,  older  than  that  of  the  ovarian  and  breast  cancer  patients  in  the  300  mg  bd  pool 
(OlympiA: 43.3 years; SOLO1: 53.5 years; SOLO2: 57.0 years; SOLO3: 58.5 years; and OlympiAD: 45.3

years). In addition, the percentage of patients in PROfound with a baseline ECOG PS of ≥1 was 51.7%, 
which is notably higher than that observed in either OlympiA (11.3%), SOLO1 (21.7%), SOLO2 (18.3%), 
or SOLO3 (25.6%). 
The incidence of AEs across most categories was higher for male patients than female patients (Table 
64).

last dose of continuous treatment. 
166 (40.5) 
Common AEs (> 10% incidence overall) reported at an incidence > 5% greater in male patients than in 
female patients were anaemia and decreased appetite. Events reported at an incidence > 5% lower in 
male patients than in female patients were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, and 
dysgeusia. These imbalances are likely to be related to differences in the disease under treatment, the 
majority of female patients being treated for breast or ovarian cancer. 
Within the context of a low number of male patients compared with female patients in the olaparib 300 
mg bd pool, no clinically meaningful gender-related differences in the safety profile of olaparib have been 
identified. 
Effect of Age 
Owing to the imbalance in the number of patients per age group in either the olaparib and abiraterone 
pool and the olaparib 300 mg bd pool, differences between groups should be interpreted with caution. 
In particular, limited conclusions can be drawn for the ≥ 85 years age group, which comprised only 1.7% 
and 0.4% of patients respectively. 
In both pools, the incidence of SAEs driven by the proportion of patients who were hospitalised or had 
prolonged  hospitalization,  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  AEs  of  anaemia  and  decreased  appetite 
increased  with  age.  Additionally,  asthenia,  oedema  peripheral,  Cardiac  disorders,  Infections  and 
infestations increased with age in the Olaparib and Abiraterone pool while constipation, accidents and 
injuries, orthostatic hypotension, fall and loss of consciousness, syncope, dizziness, ataxia and fractures 
AEs increased with age in the Olaparib 300 mg bd pool.  
Effect of Race 
Taking the imbalance in size of subgroups into account, no clinically significant differences in the safety 
profile of olaparib in White versus Asian patients have been observed in either pool. In addition, no effect 
of race on the PK of olaparib has been identified

Post marketing experience 
Olaparib (both capsule and tablet formulations) have been approved for use in a number of countries 
worldwide for a range of indications across multiple tumour types. 
AstraZeneca has comprehensive processes for signal detection, regular safety reviews, identifying and 
evaluating issues potentially affecting patient safety, and developing safety recommendations (including 
changes to the reference safety information). In addition, these processes enable the identification of 
safety topics that need to be kept under close surveillance. The safety signal detection activities include 
review of reported AEs from post-marketing sources, and a review of the published literature relevant 
to olaparib. The post-marketing data for olaparib are regularly reviewed for new findings or trends.  
Acces Programme and Ongoing Studies  
As of 15 June 2021, a total of 1904 patients have been dosed with olaparib capsules or tablets in the 
following Global Access Programmes: Named Patient Supply Scheme, French Authorisation of Temporary 
Use, Turkish Compassionate Use Programme, UK Early Access to Medicines Scheme, UK Compassionate 
Use Programme, German Compassionate Use Programme, Dutch Compassionate Use Programme, and 
USA  Early  Access  programme.  In  addition,  there  are  a  number  of  ongoing  clinical  studies  in  which 
patients have been dosed with either olaparib tablets or a blinded comparator agent. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety assessment is mainly based on 469 patients treated with olaparib 300 mg bd and 
abiraterone 1000 mg qd in the PROpel study and in the supportive study, D081DC00008 study 8. 
These data provide a significant amount of safety data, with long-term exposure (up to 2 years). 
These data were thereafter compared with a large pool of 3155 patients which received the same dose 
of olaparib as monotherapy in other indications. The pool was composed of 19 studies in various cancer 
types (n=3155) including 8 phase III studies among which PROfound (n=256) is the only study with the 
same targeted patient population, as the one of this application, mCRPC.  
Safety  and  tolerability  findings  were  consistent  between  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  of  PROpel  and 
the olaparib and abiraterone pool. 
Polled data are based on the DCO dates for the individual studies. 
Exposure  
The summary of clinical safety for the currently applied indication, mCRPC, describes the results with a 
DCO date of 30 July 2021 to match the date of the PROpel interim rPFS analysis.  
In Propel study, at the time of the DCO, almost all patients randomised had received study treatments 
794/796 patients. The number of patients still on treatment began to diverge between arms after 18 
months in favor of the olaparib+abiraterone arm. Therefore, the median total duration of exposure was 
longer  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  compared  to  the  placebo+abiraterone  arm  (17.5  months  and 
15.7 months, respectively). Of note, the combination treatment with olaparib does not appear to reduce 
the planned administration of abiraterone. 
In  the  Olaparib  and  Abiraterone  pool,  the overall  extent  of  exposure  was  largely  similar  between  the 
pool and the olaparib+abiratone arm of PROpel however with slightly lower indicators of exposure in the 
olaparib and abiraterone pool driven by a lower exposure to Olaparib in study 8.

Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  olaparib  is  well  characterised  and  is  consistent  with  previous  data  from 
olaparib  monotherapy.  The  overall  safety  profile  of  olaparib  from  PROpel  study  is  similar  to  the  one 
identified previously in other indications. Most commonly AE reported belonged to the SOC Hematologic 
disorders, gastro-intestinal disorders, General disorders and respiratory disorders and Nervous system 
disorders.  
In PROpel study, the majority of patients exposed to olaparib+abiraterone reported AEs (96.6%), which 
were approximately equally distributed between ≤ CTCAE Grade 2 (52.5%) ≥ CTCAE Grade 3 (47.5%) 
in severity with very few AEs leading to death (3.8%) or treatment discontinuation (16.2%). Of note, 
anaemia was the only AE leading to olaparib treatment discontinuation with an incidence > 1% higher 
when Olaparib was taken in association to abiraterone than when olaparib or abiraterone were taken as 
a monotherapy. 
The  toxicity  of  olaparib  associated  to  abiraterone  was  thus  most  often  manageable including by  dose 
interruptions  (41.8%),  dose  reductions  (19.6%)  and  standard  supportive  treatment  as  required.  The 
most  frequent  reason  for  treatment  interruption  and  treatment  dose  reduction  was  anaemia  with 
respectively  13.6%  and  10.0%  of  incidence,  slightly  lower  to  the  ones  for  olaparib  300  mg  bf  pool 
(respectively, 16.1% and 11%).  
Overall, the safety findings in the Olaparib and abiraterone pool had higher frequency than in the Olaparib 
300  mg  bd  pool  and  in  the  placebo+abiraterone  arm  of  PROpel,  excepted  for  AEs  leading  to  dose 
reduction of Olaparib with a slight imbalance in favor of the Olaparib 300 mg bd pool (22.3% versus 
19.6% for the Olaparib and abiraterone pool) and for AE with outcome of death with an imbalance in 
favour of the placebo+abiraterone arm (4.3% versus 3.8% for the Olaparib and abiraterone pool). 
More precisely,  a  higher  incidence  of  cytopenia  AEs  (including  anaemia  ≥  CTCAE  Grade  3),  fatigue, 
nausea and pulmonary embolism (always considered as CTCAE grade 3 in accordance with CTCAE version 
4.03) was reported in the olaparib and abiraterone pool than in the placebo+abiraterone arm of PROpel. 
This suggesting a heavier treatment for mCRPC patient population when treated with the association of 
abiraterone  and  olaparib  compared  to  when  treated  with  abiraterone  in  monotherapy.  Cytopenia  and 
pulmonary embolism were also reported at higher incidence in the olaparib and abiraterone pool than in 
the Olaparib 300 mg bd pool, potentially attributed to differences in patient population between pools 
(i.e, patient’s age).  
SAEs  were  reported  in  higher  proportion  in  the  Olaparib+abiraterone  arm  (33.9%)  compared  to  the 
placebo+abiraterone  arm  (27.0%)  and  SAEs  reported  at  an  incidence  >  1%  greater  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone arm than in the placebo+abiraterone arm were urinary tract infection, anaemia, 
and  pulmonary  embolism.  Urinary  tract  infection  and  anaemia  are  known  ADR  for  abiraterone  and 
olaparib respectively. Pulmonary embolism is a newly identified ADR for Olaparib as discussed before.  
In  accordance  with  PROpel  study,  incidence  of  SAEs  was  higher  in  the  Olaparib  and  abiraterone  pool 
(33.0%) than in the Olaparib 300 mg bd pool (19.5%) and the SEAs reported with an incidence > 1% 
greater  in  the  Olaparib  and  abiraterone  pool  where  mostly  known  ADRs  for  abiraterone  and  olparib. 
Others may be attributed to differences in patient population between pools.  
The majority of reported deaths in both arms were attributed by the investigator to progression of the 
disease under investigation (168 of 228 deaths [73.7%]); 76 in the olaparib+abiraterone arm and 92 in 
the  placebo+abiraterone  arm.  The  incidence  of  AEs  with  outcome  of  death  was  higher  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone treated patients compared to placebo+abiraterone treated patients (respectively 
4.1% and 2.8% with AE start date during and after the 30 days-follow up period). In addition, only 1 
death  in  PROpel  study  were  considered  related  to  study  treatment  by  investigator,  it  was  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone arm and due to interstitial lung disease.    
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022 
Page 143/154 
 
 
 
 
Interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis are known AESI of olaparib. 
In Olaparib 300 mg bd pool, the incidence of AE with outcome death was higher in compared to Olaparib 
and abiraterone pool (respectively, 3.6% and 0.7%). This difference could be explained by difference in 
patient population between pools. Over 30 AE with outcome of deaths, 16 was judged related to olaparib 
treatment. In the majority of study, the reason was a myelodysplastic syndrome (14) with time from 
start  of  treatment  to  days  ranging  between  (313  days  to  2053  days).  Interestingly,  in  PROfound  the 
death  was  due  pneumonia  and  neutropenia  in  the  same  patient  (1)  without  any  hematological 
malignancy (MDS/AML). However, one leukemia led to the death of one patient in PROfound but was 
considered unrelated to study treatment by the investigator.  
Dose interruptions and dose reductions 
AE  leading  to  any  study  treatment  (Olaparib,  placebo,  Abiraterone  or  prednisone/prednisolone) 
discontinuation,  reduction  and  interruption  were  more  frequent  in  Olaparib+Abiraterone  arm  than  in 
placebo+Abiraterone  arm  (respectively,  14.3%  and  10.1%;  25.1%  and  13.1%;  47.5  and  29.8%). 
However, this did not affect significantly the treatment duration in the Olaparib+Abiraterone arm as the 
median  total  treatment  duration  was  similar  to  the  actual  treatment  duration  both  for  olaparib 
(respectively 531.5 days and 519.0 days) and abiraterone (respectively 555.0 and 534.0 days). Neither 
was  impacted  the  dose  intensity  of  Olaparib  and  Abiraterone  in  the  Olaparib+abiratarone  arm  as  the 
median relative dose intensity was respectively of 98.3% and 96.5%.  
Dose interruptions and dose reductions of Olaparib or Placebo were reported respectively in 44.7% and 
20.1% of patients in the olaparib+abiraterone arm and respectively in 25.3% and 5.6% of patients in 
the placebo+abiratone arm. 
Incidence of reported AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment was higher in the olaparib+abiraterone 
arm than in the placebo+abiraterone arm (respectively, 13.8% and 7.8%). Anaemia was the only AEs 
leading to discontinuation of olaparib/placebo at an incidence > 1% greater in the olaparib+abiraterone 
arm than in the placebo+abiraterone arm.  
ADRs and AESI 
Generally,  commons  AEs  experienced  by  mCRPC  patient  treated  with  the  association  olaparib  and 
abiraterone (anaemia, fatigue, nausea, back pain, constipation, diarrhoa, etc.) were corresponding to 
known ADRs of olaparib and abiraterone as per SmPC, and potential symptoms of the underlying disease. 
No new ADRs was identified for abiraterone. 
However,  AEs  in  the  Venous  thromboenlism  events  (VTEs)  SOC  driven  by  pulmonary  embolism  were 
classified as newly ADRs for Olaparib following PROpel study. In PROpel study, VTEs were reported at a 
higher 
incidence 
in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  (29  patients;  7.3%)  compared  to  the 
placebo+abiraterone  arm  (13  patients;  3.3%)  with  respectively  93%  (27  patients)  and  61.5%  (8 
patients) of VTEs that were pulmonary embolism. Among all VTEs cases in the olaparib+abiraterone and 
the placebo+abiraterone arms of PROpel respectively, 48.3% (14 patients) and 30.8% (4 patients) were 
considered as serious, 27.6% (8 patients) and 15.4% (2 patients) led to treatment dose interruption. 
There was 1 VTE with outcome of death in the olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel that was considered 
unrelated to treatments by the investigator. VTEs were identified in previous phase III studies (PROfound 
and PAOLA-1) where olaparib 300 mg bd was used as monotherapy. VTEs reported from these clinical 
studies  did  not  identify  any  additional  confounders  other  than  the  presence  of  advanced  cancer  and 
concurrent treatment with androgen deprivation treatments or bevacizumab and showed no pattern in 
time to onset. No apparent baseline imbalance can be noted relating to baseline risk factors that would 
explain the observed imbalances. 
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022 
Page 144/154 
 
 
 
 
Currently there is no evidence to support a potential biologic-pharmacologic plausibility between olaparib 
and VTEs, however the consistent imbalance of VTEs and the lack of apparent alternative explanation 
suggest that there is at least a reasonable possibility for a causal association between Olaparib and VTEs 
and is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  for  olaparib  are  pneumonitis,  Myelodysplastic 
Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (MDS/AML) and new primary malignancies (NPMs).  
MDS/AML are known ADR for olaparib meanwhile a causal relationship between olaparib treatment and 
the development or acceleration of new primary malignancies and pneumonitis has not been established.  
Investigators in PROpel were required to record new primary malignancies and MDS/AML events beyond 
30 days after the last dose of olaparib at any point in survival follow-up. The applicant will provide an 
analysis  of  long-term  safety  data,  including  new  primary  malignancies  and  any  new  cases  of 
myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia in PROpel at the time of data cut-off 2 (DCO2) and 
also at the final overall survival (OS) analysis. 
In  the  entire  clinical  programme,  96  patients  experienced  an  MDS/AML  with  1  event  occurred  in 
PROfound  study  with  outcome  death,  but the investigator  didn’t  judge  the  event to  be  related to  the 
study treatment. No MDS/AML was reported in any arm or PROpel neither in the Olaparib and Abiraterone 
pool.  However,  the  follow-up  period  of  PROpel  and  Study  8  at  the  current  DCO  are  shorter  than  the 
studies in Olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose pool or in the entire clinical programme.  
Frequency of NPMs in PROpel study (3.0%) and in the Olaparib and Abiraterone pool (2.5%) is overall 
in line with previous experiences. However, the follow-up period of PROpel and Study 8 at the current 
DCO  are  shorter  than the  monotherapy  combined therapeutic  pool and  the  entire  clinical  programme 
pool. No NPM occured in study 8. Contributory factors to NPMs in PROpel aren’t clear as the majority of 
patients  in  PROpel  were  HRR  non  mutated  (67.3  according  to  ctDNA  testing and  52.4%  according  to 
tissue  testing  with  respectively  7.8%  or  32.8%  of  unknown  status)  and  naïve  from  chemotherapy 
(75.4%). The applicant imputed the slightly higher rate of NPM AEs in this patient population, compared 
with  other  studies,  to  the  higher  age  (mean  age  69  and  70  years  in  the  olaparib  +  abiraterone  and 
placebo + abiraterone arms, respectively) of the patients in PROpel study. 
Given the lower life expectancy of mCRPC patients compared to patients with breast or ovarian cancer 
for which Olaparib already has a marketing authorization the importance of AML/MDS and NPMs could 
be counterbalanced by the time to onset of these 2 AESI for Olaparib. The applicant confirms to provide 
an  analysis  of  long-term  safety  data,  including  new  primary  malignancies  and  any  new  cases  of 
myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia in PROpel at the time of data cut-off 2 (DCO2) and 
also at the final overall survival (OS) analysis.  
Concerning  pneumonitis,  with  the  largest  and  youngest  population  OlympiA  study  provide  the  most 
robust data source to assess the contribution of olaparib to the risk of this AESI. There was no difference 
in the incidence of pneumonitis between the olaparib (9 patients; 1.0%) and placebo arm (11 patients, 
1.2%) of Olympia. The incidence of pneumonitis in PROpel substantiate the findings of OlympiA with an 
equal incidence of pneumonitis of 0.8% in both arms.  
Overall, the majority of pneumonitis AEs reported in the olaparib monotherapy therapeutic dose pool 
were mild or moderate, non-serious, and resolved without treatment discontinuation. 
Laboratory parameters 
A  decrease  in  all  laboratory  values  for  haematological  parameters  (including  haemoglobin,  platelets, 
leukocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes) was observed when patients were treated with olaparib and 
abiraterone.  Incidence  of  patients  with  a  maximum  CTCAE  Grade  of  3  or  4  was  generally  low 
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022 
Page 145/154 
 
 
 
 
(neutronpenia  4.3%,  leukopenia  3.5%,  lymphopenia  21.4%  and  thrombocytopenia  1.3%)  at  the 
exception of anaemia and lymphopenia (respectively, 10.8% and 21.4%). Lymphopenia led to treatment 
discontinuation  in  few  cases  and  in  both  arms  (0.5%  and  0.3%  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  and 
placebo+abiraterone  arm,  respectively).  However,  these  changes  in  haematological  parameters  are 
generally mild or moderate, manageable, and reversible. 
Increases  in  creatinine  have  been  identified  as  an  ADR  with  olaparib  treatment.  AEs  of  increased 
creatinine  were  predominantly  CTCAE  grade  1  in  severity  with  a  slight  imbalance  for  grade  2  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone  arm  compared  to  the  placebo+abiraterone  arm  but  didn’t  lead  to  permanent 
discontinuation of treatment. The lab observations of elevated serum creatinine were not associated with 
renal impairment and had no significant clinical sequelae. 
Both ALT increase and AST increase are known ADRs for abiraterone. No concurrent elevations of AST 
or  ALT  >  3  ×  ULN  and  total  bilirubin  >2  ×  ULN,  irrespective  of  ALP,  were  observed  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone arm of PROpel. The incidence of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 elevations for ALT and AST was 
higher in the placebo+abiraterone arm of PROpel (5.6% and 4.1% respectively) compared to the ones 
in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  of  PROpel  (respectively,  1.8%  and  0.8%)  and  in  the  olaparib  and 
abiraterone pool (respectively, 1.5% and 0.9%) that both remained low. ALT increase led to treatment 
discontinuation  in  few  cases  and  in  both  arms  (0.3%  and  0.5%  in  the  olaparib+abiraterone  arm  and 
placebo+abiraterone  arm,  respectively).  However,  these  changes  in  hepatobiliary  parameters  were 
generally mild or moderate, manageable, and reversible. 
No  hepatobiliary  or  renal  safety  concerns  were  identified  from  a  review  of  laboratory  and  AE  data  in 
PROpel 
Special populations 
All  patients  in  PROpel  were  male,  white  and  older  than  most  of  patients  in  Olaparib  300  mg  bd  pool 
(except for PROfound study). 
Assessment  of  the  safety  of  olaparib  in  patient  subgroups  among  the  300  mg  bd  pool  has  showed  a 
higher  incidence  of  AEs  across  categories  for  male  and  higher  incidence  of  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation, AEs of anaemia and decreased appetite in older patients. No significant differences were 
found in White versus Asian patients.   
These results must be interpreted with caution owing to the imbalance in the number of patients per 
groups in the Olaparib 300 mg bd pool. However, these results are consistent with the findings in 
PROpel study and Olaparib and Abiraterone pool. 
Post marketing experience 
Based on post-marketing data, angioedema and erythema nodosum were recently added as ADRs for 
olaparib. There were no events of angioedema, nor be reported AEs of erythema nodosum in either arm 
of PROpel and in the olaparib and abiraterone pool (PROpel + Study 8). 
Acces Programme and Ongoing Studies 
From  all  the  ongoing  studies  or  patient  access  programme  no  new  or  important  safety  information 
resulting in changes to the safety profile of olaparib has been identified.   
Cumulative post-marketing data and safety data from the ongoing studies are available in the PBRER.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  olaparib  is  well  characterised  and  is  consistent  with  previous  data  from 
olaparib monotherapy. However, a new ADR was added for Olaparib that is venous thromboembolism 
events (VTEs), in particular pulmonary embolism.  
In  PROpel,  the  incidence  of  AEs  any  category,  SAEs  and  AEs  of  CTCAE  Grade  ≥  3  was  higher  in  the 
Olaparib+Abiraterone  arm  compared  to  the  placebo+Abiraterone  arm.  The  incidence  of  cytopenia, 
fatigue, nausea and pulmonary embolism was higher in the Olaparib+Abiraterone arm compared to the 
placebo+Abiraterone arm as well. 
Even  though  the  combined  therapy  of  Olaparib  and  Abiraterone  represents  a  heavier  treatment  for 
mCRPC patients compared to abiraterone alone with rapid anaemia, chronic asthenia and nausea, the 
toxicity  of  the  association was  most  often  manageable  including  by  dose  interruptions  (41.8%),  dose 
reductions  (19.6%)  and  standard  supportive  treatment  as  required.Moreover,  these  treatments 
modifications due to AEs did not affect significantly the treatment duration and the dose intensity of both 
Olaparib and Abiraterone drugs in the Olaparib+Abiraterone arm. 
2.5.5.  PSUR cycle

the product information. In addition, sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC for Lynparza hard capsules are 
revised based on the updated safety data analysis The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: Overall, the 
wording in the PL is similar to that already tested previously during the MA applications. Therefore, it is 
justified to consider the Package Leaflet User Testing report provided during review of the MA application 
procedure as relevant for this application, and that no updated document is needed for this submission. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lynparza is indicated in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment 
of adult patients with mCRPC in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated (see section 5.1). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to ESMO guideline on cancer of the prostate (2020), the recommended treatment of metastatic 
CRPC are abiraterone or enzalutamide for asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic men with chemotherapy-
naïve  metastatic  CRPC,  radium-223  for  men  with  bone-predominant  symptomatic  metastatic  CRPC 
without  visceral  metastases,  docetaxel  and  cabazitaxel  for  men  with  metastatic  CRPC  is  an  option  in 
asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic CRPC. 
The optimal sequence or combination of these agents (abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223, docetaxel 
and cabazitaxel) has not been established yet. In practice, sequencing decisions will be made in the light 
of the distribution, extent and pace of disease, co-morbidities, patient preferences and drug availability. 
Evaluation of new treatment options that would allow for early intervention in the course of mCRPC 
and that could also prolong the treatment duration of available therapies, delay disease progression, 
and improve long-term outcomes in this setting is warranted. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current application is based on results from the ProPEL study, a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled,  multicentre  study  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  olaparib  versus 
placebo, each combined with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone, as first-line treatment for men 
with mCRPC. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either olaparib or placebo, each combined with 
abiraterone  and  prednisone  or  prednisolone.  All  patients  had  to  have  evidence  of  histologically  or 
cytologically  confirmed  prostate  adenocarcinoma  and  metastatic  status  defined  as  at  least  one 
documented metastatic lesion on either a bone or CT/MRI scan. At the mCRPC stage (first-line setting), 
patients must have no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or NHA treatment. PROpel is an all-comers study 
and patient enrolment was not based on biomarker status (HRRm status). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study is met with a statistically significant improvement of rPFS in 
the FAS with a prolongation of median rPFS of 8.2 months in favor of Olaparib+Abiraterone arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022 
Page 149/154 
 
 
 
 
compared to the placebo+Abiraterone arm at DCO1 (respectively, 24.84 months and 16.59 months). 
Data at DCO2 were consistent, with a benefit of similar magnitude observed and a median rPFS 
improvement of 8.6 months for olaparib + abiraterone compared with that for placebo + abiraterone 
(24.97 vs 16.39 months). OS results from DCO2 showed median duration of follow-up of 27.56 months 
in the olaparib + abiraterone arm and 26.32 months in the placebo + abiraterone arm. The OS results 
showed statistically 17% numerical reduction in the risk of death at any given point in time (HR 0.83, 
95% CI: 0.66, 1.03, p=0.1126). 
There  was  a  favourable  trend in  PFS2  (20.6%  maturity)  for  the  olaparib  +  placebo  arm  compared to 
placebo + abiraterone arm with HR of 0.69 [95% CI: 0.51-0.94].  
The other secondary endpoints (TFST, TSRE) showed a favourable trend for olaparib compared to placebo 
in combination with abiraterone.  
Data results of rPFS and OS based on BRCAm and HRRm status from DCO2 show a benefit of similar 
magnitude as observed at DCO1. The combination olaparib + abiraterone showed a clear benefit in all 
HRR mutation subgroups (based on tissue test, cDNAt, aggregate analysis, BRCAm or non-
BRCAm/BRCAm unknwown) without detrimental effect and were overall consistent with the FAS.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The benefit of olaparib + abiraterone compared to placebo + abiraterone is uncertain in patients with 
mCRPC with non-HRRm/ unknown HRR taking into account: 
- The study was not powered to assess efficacy within subgroups based on HRR gene mutations despite 
CHMP recommendations (2018), and the results of the subgroup studies should be taken with caution 
as they are exploratory. 
-  The  non-HRRm  subgroup  by  tumour  tissue test  OS  HR  1.10  (95%  CI:  0.77,  1.57)  does not  appear 
consistent with the rest of the HRRm subgroup OS results. 
- The benefit at longer term, notably for OS, remains uncertain in non-BRCAm/non-HRRm patients. In 
order to further characterise the long-term efficacy of olaparib in the patients with mCRPC in 
D081SC00001 (PROpel) study, the MAH should provide the final OS data analyses in overall patient 
population and in all biomarker subgroups (by BRCAm and HRRm status) including rPFS and OS KM 
curves for all the subgroups.as a PAES.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  olaparib  is  well  characterised  and  is  consistent  with  previous  data  from 
olaparib  monotherapy.  The  overall  safety  profile  of  olaparib  from  PROpel  study  is  similar  to  the  one 
identified previously in other indications. Most commonly reported AEs belonged to the SOC Hematologic 
disorders, gastro-intestinal disorders, General disorders and respiratory disorders and Nervous system 
disorders.  
In  PROpel,  the  incidence  of  AEs,  SAEs  and  AEs  of  CTCAE  Grade  ≥  3  were  slightly  higher  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone arm than in the placebo+abiraterone arm (respectively, 97.2% and 94.9% for AEs, 
33.9% and 27% for SAEs and 47.2% and 38.4% for AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3) though a similar rate of 
AEs  with  outcome  death  (respectively  4%  and  4.3%).  These  differences  between 
the 
Olaparib+Abiraterone  arm  and  the  placebo+Abiraterone  arm  were  mainly  driven  by  AEs  of  anaemia, 
nausea,  fatigue  and pulmonary  embolism  with  incidence  respectively  of  45.5%  and  16.2;  28.1%  and 
12.6%; 27.9% and 18.9% and 6.5% and 1.8%. These AEs are previously known ADR for Olaparib except 
for venous thromboembolism (VTE) which is a new ADR for Olaparib.  
Assessment report  
EMA/941572/2022 
Page 150/154 
 
 
 
 
Altogether,  even  though  the  combined  therapy  of  Olaparib  and  Abiraterone  represents  a  heavier 
treatment for mCRPC patients compared to abiraterone alone, the toxicity of the association was most 
often  manageable  including  by  dose  interruptions  (41.8%),  dose  reductions  (19.6%)  and  standard 
supportive treatment as required.  
AE leading to any study treatment (Olaparib, placebo, Abiraterone or prednisone/prednisolone) 
discontinuation, reduction and interruption were more frequent in Olaparib+Abiraterone arm than in 
placebo+Abiraterone arm (respectively, 14.3% and 10.1%; 25.1% and 13.1%; 47.5 and 29.8%). 
However, this did not affect significantly the treatment duration in the Olaparib+Abiraterone arm as 
the median total treatment duration was similar to the actual treatment duration both for olaparib 
(respectively 531.5 days and 519.0 days) and abiraterone (respectively 555.0 and 534.0 days). 
Neither was impacted the dose intensity of Olaparib and Abiraterone in the Olaparib+abiratarone arm 
as the median relative dose intensity was respectively of 98.3% and 96.5%. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
MDS/AML are known ADR for olaparib meanwhile a causal relationship between olaparib treatment and 
the development or acceleration of new primary malignancies and pneumonitis has not been established.  
Investigators in PROpel were required to record new primary malignancies and MDS/AML events beyond 
30 days after the last dose of olaparib at any point in survival follow-up. The applicant will provide an 
analysis  of  long-term  safety  data,  including  new  primary  malignancies  and  any  new  cases  of 
myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia in PROpel at the final overall survival (OS) analysis.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
PROpel study met its primary endpoint with the demonstration of a statistically significant improvement 
in rPFS in the olaparib + abiraterone arm compared to placebo + abiraterone. PROpel study showed an 
improvement  of  median  rPFS  of  8.2  months  with  olaparib  +  abiraterone  treatment  compared  to  the 
placebo + abiraterone (HR = 0.66, 95% 0.54-0.81, p<0.0001). The sensitivity analysis of rPFS by BICR 
(HR  0.61;  95%  CI:  0.49,  0.74;  nominal  p<0.0001;  median  rPFS  was  27.6  months  in  the 
olaparib+abiraterone  arm  and 16.4  months  in  the  placebo+abiraterone  arm)  was  consistent  with  the 
investigator-based analysis. PROpel study showed a favourable trend of PFS2, TFST, Time to first SRE 
for olaparib + abiraterone compared to placebo + abiraterone.  
The MAH provided updated OS results from the second planned interim analysis (DCO2 14 March 2022). 
Median duration of follow-up for OS were of 27.56 months in the olaparib + abiraterone arm and 26.32 
months in the placebo + abiraterone arm. The OS results showed statistically 17% numerical reduction 
in the risk of death at any given point in time (HR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.03, p=0.1126). The MAH will 
provide the final OS data in overall patient population (see Annex II). 
Subgroup’s  analysis  of  rPFS  based  on  the  stratification  factors  did  not  reveal  an  obvious  differential 
benefit across most of the pre-defined subgroups compared with the overall population.  
The indication was restricted to patients with mCRPC in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated 
to  be  in  line  with  the  recommendations  and  the  population  that  could  benefit  from  the  study’s 
combination olaparib + abiraterone (see Efficacy discussion). 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  olaparib  is  well  characterised  and  is  consistent  with  previous  data  from 
olaparib  monotherapy.  However,  venous  thromboembolism  events  (VTEs),  in  particular  pulmonary 
embolism, was added as new ADR for Olaparib (see Product information). 
In PROpel study, the incidence of AEs any category, SAEs and AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 was higher in 
the Olaparib+Abiraterone arm compared to the placebo+Abiraterone arm. The incidence of cytopenia, 
fatigue, nausea and pulmonary embolism was also higher in the Olaparib+Abiraterone arm compared to 
the placebo+Abiraterone arm.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Olaparib has demonstrated a statistically significant and clinical relevant improvement in rPFS in adult 
patients with mCRPC after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not 
clinically indicated, supported by the secondary endpoints.  
Even though there are currently uncertainties on the magnitude of the benefit in terms of OS in the 
non-BRCAm/non-HRRm patients, the results are considered clinically relevant and sufficient to 
conclude on clinical benefit in the intended treatment setting. The benefit at longer term, notably for 
OS, will be submitted in a post-approval measure (PAES). 
Overall, the safety profile of olaparib is well characterised and is consistent with previous data from 
olaparib monotherapy. It can be concluded that the benefits outweigh the risks.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None  
3.7.4.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lynparza is positive in the following indication: Lynparza is indicated in combination 
with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC in whom 
chemotherapy is not clinically indicated (see section 5.1).  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy of 
olaparib in the patients with mCRPC in D081SC00001 (PROpel) study, the MAH should provide the final 
OS data analyses in overall patient population and in all biomarker subgroups (by BRCAm and HRRm 
status) including rPFS and OS KM curves for all the subgroups.

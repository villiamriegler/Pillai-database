CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Regdanvimab is indicated for the treatment of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who 
do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 
(see section 5.1).  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Regdanvimab should only be administered in settings in which health care providers have immediate 
access to appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicinal products to treat a severe infusion 
reaction, including anaphylaxis, and where patients can be clinically monitored during administration 
and be observed for at least 1 hour after infusion is complete (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
The recommended dosage of regdanvimab in adults is a single IV infusion of 40 mg/kg. Regdanvimab 
should be administered within 7 days of onset of symptoms of COVID-19 (see section 5.1). 
The volume of Regkirona is calculated as follows.

Hypersensitivity including infusion-related reactions and anaphylactic reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions, have been observed 
during and following administration of regdanvimab (see section 4.8).  
Patients should be clinically monitored during administration and be observed for at least 1 hour after 
infusion is complete. 
Signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions may include fever, difficulty breathing, reduced 
oxygen saturation, chills, fatigue, arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia, 
palpitation), chest pain or discomfort, weakness, altered mental status, nausea, headache, 
bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, angioedema, throat irritation, rash including urticaria, 
pruritus, myalgia, vaso-vagal reactions (e.g., presyncope, syncope), dizziness and diaphoresis. 
If an infusion-related reaction occurs, slowing or stopping the infusion should be considered and 
appropriate medicinal products and/or supportive care should be administered. 
Antiviral resistance 
The clinical trials with regdanvimab were conducted in subjects who were predominantly infected 
with the wild-type virus and the Alpha (UK origin/B.1.1.7 lineage) variant. Clinical efficacy data for 
regdanvimab against some circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants with decreased in vitro susceptibility is 
currently limited (see section 5.1).  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed with regdanvimab.  
Regdanvimab is a monoclonal antibody, which is not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome 
P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant medicinal products that are renally excreted or 
that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are considered unlikely. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Reproductive and developmental studies have not been performed with regdanvimab.  
Nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with regdanvimab (see section 5.3). 
In tissue cross-reactivity (TCR) studies with regdanvimab using human foetal and neonatal tissues, no 
binding of clinical concern was detected in the foetal tissues. Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) 
antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, regdanvimab has the potential to be 
transferred from the mother to the developing foetus. It is unknown whether the potential transfer of 
regdanvimab provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developing foetus. 
Regdanvimab should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother justifies the 
potential risk to the foetus.

Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether regdanvimab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after 
ingestion. Administration of regdanvimab while breast-feeding can be considered when clinically 
indicated. 
Fertility 
No fertility studies have been performed. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Regkirona has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Overall, 906 subjects have been exposed to regdanvimab in clinical trials in both healthy subjects and 
non-hospitalised  patients.  The  safety  of  regdanvimab  is  based  on  exposure  of  ambulatory  (non-
hospitalised) patients with COVID-19.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Adverse reactions reported with regdanvimab based on experience from clinical trials in healthy subjects 
and mild to moderate COVID-19 patients as well as adverse reactions reported from post-marketing 
experience are listed in Table 2 by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: 
very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000).  Within each  frequency  grouping,  undesirable effects  are  presented in  order of decreasing 
seriousness.

Infusion-related reactions1 
1 Infusion-related reaction (IRR) includes hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, and symptoms reported as 
IRRs  are  described  below  in  ‘Infusion-related  reactions’.  Anaphylaxis  was  identified  from  post-
marketing experience. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infusion-related reactions 
Immediate infusion-related reactions were noted for 0.6% of regdanvimab-treated patients and 1.2% of 
placebo-treated patients. Reported events of fever, pruritus, hypertension and dyspnoea were mild with 
two cases of fever being moderate and one case of hypertension being severe and palpitation, 
presyncope and urticaria were moderate in the regdanvimab-treated patients. All patients in the 
regdanvimab treatment group recovered from the events. 
In post-marketing experience, one case of anaphylaxis was reported during infusion of regdanvimab 
with symptoms of dyspnoea, chest discomfort and cough. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Single doses up to 8,000 mg have been administered in clinical trials without dose-limiting toxicity. 
Treatment of overdose should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital 
signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific antidote for overdose 
with regdanvimab.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immune sera and immunoglobulins, antiviral monoclonal antibodies, 
ATC code: J06BD06 
Mechanism of action 
Regdanvimab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to the receptor binding 
domain (RBD) of the spike(s) protein of SARS-CoV-2 consequently blocking cellular entry and 
SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
Antiviral activity 
The in vitro neutralisation activity of regdanvimab against SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/ 
2020) was assessed by plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) using VeroE6 cells. Regdanvimab 
neutralised this SARS-CoV-2 strain with an IC50 value of 9.70 ng/mL and an IC90 value of 25.09 
ng/mL. 
The plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) using authentic SARS-CoV-2 variant virus indicate 
that regdanvimab retained activity against the Alpha (UK origin/B.1.1.7 lineage), Zeta (Brazilian 
origin/P.2), Iota (New York origin/B.1.526) and Eta (Nigerian origin/B.1.525) variants. Reduced 
neutralising activity against Gamma (Brazilian origin/P.1), Beta (South African origin/B.1.351), 
Epsilon (Californian origin/B.1.427 and B.1.429), Kappa (Indian origin/B.1.617.1) and Delta (Indian 
origin/B.1.617.2) variants were observed (Table 3). Microneutralisation data using authentic SARS-
CoV-2 variant virus indicate that regdanivimab retains activity against the Alpha variant and has 
reduced activity against the Beta and Gamma variants (Table 3).

Antiviral resistance 
In vitro virus passaging with authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses in VeroE6 cells in the presence/absence 
of regdanvimab identified a S494P amino acid substitution located in the RBD of the spike protein. 
Pseudovirus assay results with Q493K, Q493R, S494L and S494P showed IC50 above 500 ng/mL. 
In Study CT-P59 3.2 (Phase 3), sequencing data collected at study visits were available for 557 
patients with COVID-19 (240 regdanvimab-treated patients and 317 placebo-treated patients). At an 
allele fraction of ≥15%, N501Y was the most frequently detected variant present in 76.7% (184/240) 
of patients in the regdanvimab group and 79.5% (252/317) of patients in the placebo group. At 
baseline, no patients had a combination of L452R, T478K and P681R mutations (associated with the 
Delta variant). Three patients (none from the regdanvimab group and 3 patients from the placebo 
group) had the combination of K417N, E484K and N501Y mutations (the Beta variant), and 10 
patients (5 patients from each group) had the combination of K417T, E484K and N501Y mutations 
(the Gamma variant). 
Variants with in vitro reduced susceptibility at spike protein amino acid positions Q493K/R or 
S494P/L at an allele fraction of ≥15% were detected for 17.9% (43/240) of patients in the 
regdanvimab group and none in the placebo group at posttreatment. Phenotyping assessments were 
done with variants in RBD at an allelic frequency of ≥15% and all variants in epitope found in 
genotyping from the regdanvimab-treated patients in Study CT-P59 3.2 (Phase 3) including F342S, 
R403G/T, Y449H, Y453C, L455F/S, K458R, F486I, L492S, Q493L, S494T and F490I using a 
luciferase-based pseudovirus assay. The reduction in susceptibility was below five-fold for all of these 
except for L455F/S, F486I, Q493L and S494T variants. For these variants, the fold-change was >20.  
Clinical efficacy 
A Phase 3 of Study CT-P59 3.2 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial 
studying regdanvimab for the treatment of unvaccinated adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-
19 and was conducted in multiple countries including the European Union (79.5%), the United States 
(7.6%) and Asia (0.9%). This study enrolled adult patients who were not hospitalised, had at least one 
or more symptoms of COVID-19 for ≤7 days, oxygen saturation >94% on room air and not requiring 
supplemental oxygen therapy and they were enrolled from January 18, 2021 and clinical efficacy 
endpoints were analysed based on data up to the cut-off date of May 21, 2021. Treatment was initiated 
after obtaining a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral infection determination.  
A total of 1315 patients were randomised in a 1:1 manner to receive a single infusion of regdanvimab 
at doses of 40 mg/kg (N=656) or placebo (N=659) over 60 minutes. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with clinical symptoms requiring 
hospitalisation, oxygen therapy, or experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to Day 28. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This was analysed in all patients randomly assigned to the study drug, who are at increased risk of 
progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalisation (defined as having at least one of the following 
risk factors for severe COVID-19: age >50 years; BMI >30 kg/m2; cardiovascular disease, including 
hypertension; chronic lung disease, including asthma; type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus; chronic 
kidney disease, including those on dialysis; chronic liver disease; and immunosuppressed, based on 
investigator’s assessment).   
Among all randomised patients, 66.9% of patients were at increased risk of progressing to severe 
COVID-19 and/or hospitalisation. Among patients at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-
19 and/or hospitalisation, the baseline median age was 54 years (range: 18 to 87); 19.4% of patients 
aged 65 or older and 4.0% of patients aged 75 or older; 53.6% of patients were male; 88.6% were 
White, 19.9% were Hispanic or Latino, 0.8% were Asian and 0.8% were Black or African American. 
The median time from the initial symptom onset was 4 days; mean viral load at baseline was 5.8 log10 
copies/mL in the regdanvimab treatment group and 5.9 log10 copies/mL in placebo group. Forty-seven 
percent and 52.4% of patients had mild and moderate COVID-19, respectively. The most common risk 
factors were advanced age (age >50 years) (66.1%), cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, 
(50.3%) and obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) (47.2%).

In addition, a total of 3 patients died (1 regdanvimab-treated patient and 2 placebo-treated patients) 
due to worsening of COVID-19. 
Time to Clinical Recovery up to Day 14 
Time to clinical recovery was defined as time from study drug administration to the time when 
symptoms, which were scored as ‘moderate’ or ‘severe’ at baseline reduced to ‘mild’ or ‘absent’, and 
symptoms scored as ‘mild’ or ‘absent’ at baseline were scored as ‘absent’. Symptoms ‘absent’ in 
intensity at baseline should maintain as ‘absent’ for at least 48 hours. Symptoms that were absent at 
baseline but became ‘severe’, ‘moderate’, or ‘mild’ in intensity during the study were considered 
clinically recovered if it changed back to ‘absent’ for at least 48 hours. Missing symptoms at baseline 
were considered to be clinically recovered if they were ‘absent’ for at least 48 hours. Symptoms 
assessed were limited to feeling feverish, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore 
throat, body pain or muscle pain, fatigue, and headache. 
The median time to clinical recovery (at least 48 hours) in all randomised patients who are at increased 
risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalisation (as defined above) was significantly 
shorter for regdanvimab-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients (median, 9.27 days 
vs. not calculated). As less than 50% of the patients in the placebo group achieved clinical recovery up 
to Day 14, it was not possible to calculate the median time to clinical recovery up to Day 14. However, 
it can be considered that the patients in the regdanvimab treatment group demonstrated a shortened 
time to clinical recovery of at least 4.73 days compared to the placebo group assuming the median 
time to clinical recovery in the placebo-treated patients as a minimum of 14 days. The difference in 
time to clinical recovery between the treatment groups was statistically significant (p<0.0001 
[stratified log-rank test]; clinical recovery ratio [95% CI] = 1.58 [1.31, 1.90]).  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Regkirona in the treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in one or more subsets of the 
paediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.2 for information on paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption and distribution 
Following the administration of the recommended dose regimen (a single dose of 40 mg/kg) in 
COVID-19 patients, the mean (CV%) Cmax level was 1017 µg/mL (27%). 
The mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) after intravenous administration 
of regdanvimab 40 mg/kg was 83 mL/kg (26%) in COVID-19 patients. 
Elimination 
Regdanvimab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways 
in the same manner as endogenous IgG. No major age- or weight-related differences in clearance or 
volume of distribution were observed in COVID-19 patients.  
In studies with COVID-19 patients, the mean (CV%) clearance of regdanvimab 40 mg/kg was 0.20 
mL/hr/kg (24%). 
In patients with COVID-19, the mean (CV%) terminal half-life for 40 mg/kg of regdanvimab was 17 
days (37%). 
Linearity 
Based on the PK analysis in healthy subjects, regdanvimab was approximately dose proportional in 
terms of maximal and systemic exposure (Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf) over the dose range of 10 
mg/kg to 80 mg/kg. 
Other special populations 
Elderly 
Based on pharmacokinetic subgroup analyses, there is no difference in pharmacokinetics of 
regdanvimab in elderly patients compared to younger patients. 
Paediatric patients  
The pharmacokinetics of regdanvimab in paediatric patients has not been evaluated.  
Hepatic and renal impairment  
The pharmacokinetics of regdanvimab has not been evaluated in patients with renal and/or hepatic 
impairment. Regdanvimab is not eliminated intact in the urine, thus renal impairment is not expected 
to affect the exposure of regdanvimab. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of tissue cross-
reactivity and repeated dose toxicity. 
In a 3-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, transient moderate to marked 
decreases in neutrophils and haematology parameter changes were observed in 20% of animals at a 
dose of about 9 times the human clinical exposure.  
In the TCR studies with regdanvimab using human adult, neonatal, and cynomolgus tissues, specific 
positive stainings in meningeal arachnoid cap cells in the brain and/or spinal cord tissues were 
observed. These findings were not associated with neurological symptoms and histopathological 
findings in the toxicity study, indicating that this TCR finding is less likely to have clinical relevance.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Regkirona is and what it is used for 
The active substance of Regkirona is regdanvimab. It is a monoclonal antibody used for the treatment 
of COVID-19, a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2.  
Regkirona is given to adult patients with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen and 
who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. 
This medicine stops the virus from entering human cells by binding to the spike protein of 
SARS-CoV-2. When it attaches to the spike protein, the interaction between the virus and the cellular 
receptor is blocked and the ability of the virus to enter the body’s cells is reduced. This can help your 
body to resist the virus infection, and may help to prevent the disease from getting worse. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Regkirona  
Do not use Regkirona: 
- 
if you are allergic to regdanvimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
➔ Talk to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible, if this applies to you.

Instructions for healthcare professionals 
Regkirona 60 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion 
regdanvimab 
Each single-use vial contains 960 mg of regdanvimab in 16 mL. 
Regdanvimab should only be administered in settings in which health care providers have immediate 
access to appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicinal products to treat a severe infusion 
reaction, including anaphylaxis.  
Monitor the patient for side effects during and at least 1 hour after the infusion is complete.  
If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, 
immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medicinal products and/or supportive 
therapy. 
Dilute the concentrate with sodium chloride solution for infusion 
Regkirona solution for infusion should be prepared by a qualified healthcare professional using aseptic 
technique: 
• 
Remove Regkirona vial(s) from refrigerated storage and allow to equilibrate to room 
temperature (not exceeding 30°C) for approximately 20 minutes before preparation. Do not 
expose to direct heat. Do not shake the vial(s). 
Regkirona is a clear to opalescent, colourless to pale yellow solution for infusion. Inspect 
Regkirona vial(s) visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to dilution. Should 
either be observed, the vial(s) must be discarded, and new vial(s) should be used for preparation. 
Calculate total volume of Regkirona to be administered. The volume of Regkirona is calculated 
as follows. 
• 
• 
Calculation to determine the total volume of Regkirona to be administered: 
Patient’s body weight (kg) x Regkirona dose (40 mg/kg) 
Vial concentration (60 mg/mL) 
= Volume of Regkirona (mL) 
Calculation to determine the total number of Regkirona vials needed: 
Total Regkirona volume (mL) to be administered 
Total volume per vial (16 mL/vial) 
= Number of Regkirona vials needed

Note: If a patient’s weight is more than 200 kg, the dose calculation should use 200 kg. The maximal 
recommended dose is 8,000 mg. 
• 
Dilute Regkirona in a bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. 
The total volume of the medicinal product and sodium chloride should be 250 mL. 
o 
In a 250 mL bag of sodium chloride, withdraw and discard the required volume (which is 
identical to the calculated volume of Regkirona) of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
from the infusion bag. 
o  Withdraw the calculated volume of Regkirona from the vial(s) using a sterile syringe.

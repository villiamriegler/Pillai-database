of the SmPC and section 4 of the Package Leaflet for 
the medicinal product Segluromet, containing the 
active substances Ertugliflozin L-pyroglutamic acid 
and Metformin hydrochloride, regarding the risk for 
vitamin B12 deficiency.  
The topic was assessed as part of mutual recognition 
procedures (FR/H/0181/001-3) for the mono-
component containing metformin product 
(Glucophage). The current proposed update of the 
product information for ertugliflozin/metformin 
combination product (Segluromet) is the same as for 
the mono-component product containing metformin. 
In addition, the MAH proposed minor editorial 
changes to the PI.

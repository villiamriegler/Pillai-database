EVOTAZ 300 mg/150 mg film-coated tablets 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each film-coated tablet contains atazanavir sulphate corresponding to 300 mg atazanavir and 150 mg 
of cobicistat. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Film-coated tablet 
Pink, oval, biconvex, film-coated tablet of approximate dimensions of 19 mm x 10.4 mm, debossed 
with "3641" on one side and plain on the other side. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
EVOTAZ is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of 
HIV-1 infected adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older weighing at least 35 kg) without 
known mutations associated with resistance to atazanavir (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of EVOTAZ for adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older weighing at 
least 35 kg) is one tablet once daily taken orally with food (see section 5.2). 
Advice on missed doses 
If EVOTAZ is missed within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, patients should be instructed to 
take the prescribed dose of EVOTAZ with food as soon as possible. If this is noticed later than 
12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the missed dose should not be taken and the patient should 
resume the usual dosing schedule. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Based on the very limited renal elimination of cobicistat and atazanavir, no special precautions or dose 
adjustments of EVOTAZ are required for patients with renal impairment. 
EVOTAZ is not recommended for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular 
secretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular function. EVOTAZ should not be 
initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min if any co-administered medicinal 
product (e.g. emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil or adefovir) requires dose adjustment 
based on creatinine clearance (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2).

Hepatic impairment 
There are no pharmacokinetic data regarding the use of EVOTAZ in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Atazanavir and cobicistat are metabolised by the hepatic system. Atazanavir should be used with 
caution in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment. However, atazanavir must not 
be used in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) to severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic 
impairment. No dose adjustment of cobicistat is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment. Cobicistat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not 
recommended in these patients. 
EVOTAZ should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment. EVOTAZ must not 
be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Paediatric population 
Children from birth to 3 months of age 
EVOTAZ should not be used in children less than 3 months of age because of safety concerns 
especially taking into account the potential risk of kernicterus associated with the atazanavir 
component. 
Children from 3 months to < 12 years of age or weighing < 35 kg 
The safety and efficacy of EVOTAZ in children less than 12 years of age or weighing less than 35 kg 
have not been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Pregnancy and postpartum 
Treatment with EVOTAZ during pregnancy results in low atazanavir exposure. Therefore, therapy 
with EVOTAZ should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during 
therapy with EVOTAZ should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Method of administration 
EVOTAZ is to be taken orally with food (see section 5.2). The film-coated tablet should be swallowed 
whole and must not be chewed, broken, cut or crushed.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The choice of EVOTAZ in patients should be based on individual viral resistance testing and the 
patient’s treatment history (see section 5.1). 
Pregnancy 
Treatment with atazanavir/cobicistat 300/150 mg during the second and third trimester has been 
shown to result in low atazanavir exposure. Cobicistat levels decrease and may not provide sufficient 
boosting. The substantial reduction in atazanavir exposure may result in virological failure and an 
increased risk of mother to child transmission of HIV infection. Therefore, therapy with EVOTAZ 
should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with 
EVOTAZ should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.6). 
Patients with co-existing conditions 
Hepatic impairment 
The use of EVOTAZ is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. 
EVOTAZ should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 
and 5.2). 
Atazanavir 
Atazanavir is primarily hepatically metabolised and increased plasma concentrations were observed in 
patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). The safety and efficacy of atazanavir have 
not been established in patients with significant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic 
hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe 
and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions (see section 4.8). In case of concomitant antiviral 
therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for 
these medicinal products. 
Patients with previous liver dysfunction or patients with chronic active hepatitis have an increased 
frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be 
monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such 
patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. 
Cobicistat 
Cobicistat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
EVOTAZ is not recommended in patients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Effects on estimated creatinine clearance 
Cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular 
secretion of creatinine. This effect on serum creatinine, leading to a decrease in the estimated creatine 
clearance, should be taken into consideration when EVOTAZ is administered to patients in whom the 
estimated creatinine clearance is used to guide aspects of their clinical management, including 
adjusting doses of co-administered medicinal products. For more information consult the cobicistat 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
EVOTAZ should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min if one or 
more co-administered medicinal product requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance (e.g. 
emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil or adefovir; see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). 
As atazanavir and cobicistat are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they will be 
significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
There are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and 
cobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that 
include tenofovir disoproxil without cobicistat. 
QT prolongation 
Dose related asymptomatic prolongations in PR interval with atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ 
have been observed in clinical studies. Caution should be used with medicinal products known to 
induce PR prolongations. In patients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher 
atrioventricular or complex bundle-branch block), EVOTAZ should be used with caution and only if 
the benefits exceed the risk (see section 5.1). Particular caution should be used when prescribing 
EVOTAZ in association with medicinal products which have the potential to increase the QT interval 
and/or in patients with pre-existing risk factors (bradycardia, long congenital QT, electrolyte 
imbalances (see sections 4.8 and 5.3). 
Haemophiliac patients 
There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and 
haemarthroses, in type A and B haemophiliac patients treated with protease inhibitors. In some 
patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with 
protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal 
relationship has been suggested, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. 
Haemophiliac patients should, therefore, be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. 
Weight and metabolic parameters 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral 
therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to the disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in 
some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating 
this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to 
established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
In clinical studies, atazanavir has been shown to induce dyslipidaemia to a lesser extent than 
comparators. 
Hyperbilirubinaemia 
Reversible elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl 
transferase (UGT) have occurred in patients receiving atazanavir (see section 4.8). Hepatic 
transaminase elevations that occur with elevated bilirubin in patients receiving EVOTAZ should be 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
evaluated for alternative aetiologies. Alternative antiretroviral therapy to EVOTAZ may be considered 
if jaundice or scleral icterus is unacceptable to a patient. 
Indinavir is also associated with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia due to inhibition of 
UGT. Combinations of EVOTAZ and indinavir have not been studied and co-administration of these 
medicinal products is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Cholelithiasis 
Cholelithiasis has been reported in patients receiving atazanavir (see section 4.8). Some patients 
required hospitalisation for additional management and some had complications. If signs or symptoms 
of cholelithiasis occurs, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered. 
Chronic kidney disease 
Chronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has 
been reported during post-marketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown 
an association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to 
atazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This 
association was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the 
renal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.8). 
Nephrolithiasis 
Nephrolithiasis has been reported in patients receiving atazanavir (see section 4.8). Some patients 
required hospitalisation for additional management and some had complications. In some cases, 
nephrolithiasis has been associated with acute renal failure or renal insufficiency. If signs or symptoms 
of nephrolithiasis occurs, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered. 
Immune reactivation syndrome 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, 
such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. 
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, 
and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and 
treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune 
hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported 
time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Osteonecrosis 
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience 
joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. 
Rash and associated syndromes 
Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks 
of starting therapy with atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ. 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported in patients receiving 
atazanavir. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reactions. EVOTAZ or any other medicinal product containing atazanavir should be discontinued if 
severe rash develops. 
The best results in managing these events come from early diagnosis and immediate interruption of 
any suspect medicines. If the patient has developed SJS or DRESS associated with the use of 
EVOTAZ, EVOTAZ may not be restarted. 
Co-administration with antiretroviral medicinal products 
EVOTAZ is indicated for use with other antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. EVOTAZ 
should not be used in combination with products containing the same active components including 
atazanavir, cobicistat or with fixed-dose products that contain cobicistat. EVOTAZ should not be used 
in combination with another antiretroviral that requires pharmacokinetic enhancement (i.e., another 
protease inhibitor or elvitegravir) since dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been 
established and may result in decreased plasma concentrations of atazanavir and/or the other 
antiretroviral leading to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Co-administration of 
EVOTAZ with other protease inhibitors is not recommended. Because atazanavir is a component of 
EVOTAZ, co-administration of EVOTAZ with nevirapine or efavirenz is not recommended (see 
section 4.5). 
EVOTAZ should not be used in combination with ritonavir or medicinal products containing ritonavir 
due to similar pharmacological effects of cobicistat and ritonavir on CYP3A (see section 4.5). 
Interactions with other medicinal products 
Atazanavir is metabolised principally by CYP3A4. Cobicistat is a strong mechanism-based CYP3A 
inhibitor and is a CYP3A substrate. Co-administration of EVOTAZ and medicinal products that 
induce CYP3A4 is contraindicated or not recommended (see sections 4.3 and 4.5) because, in addition 
to decreased plasma concentrations of atazanavir due to induction of CYP3A4, decreased plasma 
concentrations of cobicistat could result in cobicistat plasma levels that are insufficient to achieve 
adequate pharmacoenhancement of atazanavir. 
Increased plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A (including 
atazanavir) are observed on co-administration with cobicistat. Higher plasma concentrations of co-
administered medicinal products can result in increased or prolonged therapeutic effects or adverse 
reactions. For medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A these higher plasma concentrations may 
potentially lead to severe, life-threatening or fatal events (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). 
Co-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the 
clearance of atazanavir and cobicistat, resulting in increased atazanavir and cobicistat plasma 
concentrations (see section 4.5). 
Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or 
UGT1A1. If switching from atazanavir boosted with ritonavir to EVOTAZ, caution is required during 
the first two weeks of treatment with EVOTAZ, particularly if doses of any concomitantly 
administered medicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of ritonavir as a 
pharmacoenhancer (see section 4.5). 
Cobicistat is a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor and is metabolised to a minor extent by CYP2D6. 
Co-administration with EVOTAZ can increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are 
metabolised by CYP2D6 (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). 
Because atazanavir is a component of EVOTAZ, the combination of EVOTAZ with atorvastatin is not 
recommended (see section 4.5). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PDE5 inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
Particular caution should be used when prescribing PDE5-inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, or 
avanafil) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in patients receiving EVOTAZ. Co-administration of 
EVOTAZ with these medicinal products is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and 
may result in PDE5-associated adverse reactions such as hypotension, visual changes and priapism 
(see section 4.5). 
Co-administration of voriconazole and EVOTAZ is not recommended unless an assessment of the 
benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant use of EVOTAZ and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized by 
CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic 
corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5). 
Co-administration of EVOTAZ with warfarin has the potential to produce serious and/or 
life-threatening bleeding due to increased warfarin plasma concentrations, and it is recommended that 
the International Normalized Ratio (INR) be monitored (see section 4.5). 
Co-administration of EVOTAZ with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is not recommended due to the 
decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra-gastric pH increase with PPIs (see section 4.5). 
Contraception requirements 
Plasma concentrations of drospirenone are increased following administration of 
drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol with atazanavir/cobicistat. If drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol is co-
administered with atazanavir/cobicistat, clinical monitoring is recommended due to the potential for 
hyperkalemia. 
Data are not available to make recommendations regarding the use of EVOTAZ with other oral 
contraceptives. Alternative forms of contraception (non-hormonal) should be considered (see 
section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Drug interaction trials were not conducted for EVOTAZ. As EVOTAZ contains atazanavir and 
cobicistat, any interactions that have been identified with these active substances individually may 
occur with EVOTAZ. 
Complex or unknown mechanisms of drug interaction preclude extrapolation of ritonavir drug 
interactions to certain cobicistat drug interactions. The recommendations given for concomitant use of 
atazanavir and other medicinal products may, therefore, differ depending on whether atazanavir is 
boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat. In particular, atazanavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive 
for CYP3A induction (see section 4.3 and the interaction table). Caution is also required during the 
first time of treatment if switching the pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat (see section 4.4). 
Medicinal products that affect atazanavir/cobicistat exposure 
Atazanavir is metabolised in the liver through CYP3A4. 
Cobicistat is a CYP3A substrate and is metabolised to a minor extent by CYP2D6. 
Concomitant use contraindicated 
Co-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A (such as 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort [Hypericum perforatum]) 
may result in decreased plasma concentrations of atazanavir and/or cobicistat, leading to loss of 
therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance to atazanavir (see section 4.3 and Table 1). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant use not recommended 
Co-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products containing ritonavir or cobicistat, which are 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A, may result in additional boosting and increased plasma concentration of 
atazanavir. 
Co-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased 
plasma concentration of atazanavir and/or cobicistat. Some examples include, but are not limited to, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole (see Table 1). 
Co-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products that are moderate to weak inducers of 
CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentration of atazanavir and/or cobicistat, leading to loss 
of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance to atazanavir. Some examples include, but 
are not limited to etravirine, nevirapine, efavirenz, fluticasone and bosentan (see Table 1). 
Medicinal products that may be affected by atazanavir/cobicistat 
Atazanavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and UGT1A1. Atazanavir is a weak to moderate inhibitor of 
CYP2C8. Atazanavir has been shown in vivo not to induce its own metabolism, nor to increase the 
biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4. 
Cobicistat is a strong mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor and a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor. Cobicistat 
inhibits the transporters p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
Cobicistat is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. 
Cobicistat is not expected to induce CYP3A4 or P-gp. Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or UGT1A1. 
Concomitant use contraindicated 
Co-administration of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A and have narrow therapeutic 
indeces and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or 
life-threatening events are contraindicated with EVOTAZ. These medicinal products include 
alfuzosin, amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, colchicine, dronedarone, ergot deriviatives (e.g. 
dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), lomitapide, lovastatin, orally 
administered midazolam, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, lurasidone, simvastatin, sildenafil (when 
used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension), avanafil, systemic lidocaine, ticagrelor, terfenadine and 
triazolam. 
Co-administration of EVOTAZ with grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir 
fixed dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis C infection) is contraindicated because of the 
increase in grazoprevir and elbasvir plasma concentrations and potential for the increase in risk of 
ALT elevations associated with the increase in grazoprevir concentrations (see section 4.3 and 
Table 1). Co-administration of EVOTAZ with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination is 
contraindicated because of the potential increase in the risk of ALT elevations due to a significant 
increase in glecaprevir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (see section 4.3). 
Increased plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A, CYP2C8, 
CYP2D6 and/or UGT1A1 are expected when co-administered with EVOTAZ. Co-administration of 
EVOTAZ in patients receiving medicinal products that are substrates of the transporters P-gp, BCRP, 
MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma concentrations of the 
co-administered medicinal products (see section 4.4). Co-administration with dabigatran, a substrate of 
P-gp, is contraindicated. Clinically significant interactions between EVOTAZ and substrates of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 are not expected. 
Interaction table 
Interactions between EVOTAZ and other medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below (increase is 
indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”). The recommendations shown in Table 1 are 
based on either drug interaction trials of unboosted atazanavir, atazanavir boosted with ritonavir, 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cobicistat or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of the interaction and potential for 
serious adverse reactions or loss of therapeutic effect of EVOTAZ. If available, 90% confidence 
intervals (CI) are shown in parentheses. The studies presented in Table 1 were conducted in healthy 
subjects unless otherwise noted.

ANTI-RETROVIRALS 
Protease inhibitors: EVOTAZ in combination with other protease inhibitors is not recommended 
because co-administration may not provide adequate protease inhibitor exposure. 
Indinavir 
Indinavir is associated with 
indirect unconjugated 
hyperbilirubinaemia due to 
inhibition of UGT. 
Co-administration of EVOTAZ and 
indinavir is not recommended 
(see section 4.4). 
Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) 
Lamivudine 150 mg

Recommendations concerning 
co-administration 
Tenofovir DF may decrease the 
AUC and Cmin of atazanavir. When 
co-administered with tenofovir DF, 
it is recommended that EVOTAZ 
and tenofovir DF 300 mg be given 
together with food. Atazanavir 
increases tenofovir concentrations. 
Higher concentrations could 
potentiate tenofovir-associated 
adverse reactions, including renal 
disorders. Patients receiving 
tenofovir disoproxil should be 
monitored for tenofovir-associated 
adverse reactions. 
When co-administering tenofovir 
alafenamide/emtricitabine and 
EVOTAZ, the recommended dose 
of tenofovir 
alafenamide/emtricitabine is

decrease cobicistat plasma 
concentrations. This may result in 
loss of therapeutic effect of 
EVOTAZ and development of 
resistance to atazanavir (see 
section 4.4). 
EVOTAZ is not recommended for

Voriconazole should not be 
co-administered with EVOTAZ 
unless the benefit/risk assessment 
justifies the use of voriconazole 
(see section 4.4). Clinical 
monitoring may be needed upon 
co-administration with EVOTAZ. 
Clinical monitoring is 
recommended upon

Recommendations concerning 
co-administration 
Co-administration of EVOTAZ and 
rifabutin is not recommended. If 
the combination is needed, the 
recommended dose of rifabutin is 
150 mg 3 times per week on set 
days (for example 
Monday-Wednesday-Friday). 
Increased monitoring for 
rifabutin-associated adverse 
reactions including neutropenia and 
uveitis is warranted due to an 
expected increase in exposure to 
rifabutin. Further dosage reduction 
of rifabutin to 150 mg twice 
weekly on set days is 
recommended for patients in whom 
the 150 mg dose 3 times per week 
is not tolerated. It should be kept in 
mind that the twice weekly dosage 
of 150 mg may not provide an 
optimal exposure to rifabutin thus 
leading to a risk of rifamycin 
resistance and a treatment failure. 
Consideration should be given to 
official guidance on the appropriate 
treatment of tuberculosis in 
HIV-infected patients. 
Rifampicin substantially decreases 
plasma concentrations of 
atazanavir, which may result in loss 
of therapeutic effect of EVOTAZ 
and development of resistance to 
atazanavir. The combination of 
rifampicin and EVOTAZ is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3).

CORTICOSTEROIDS 
Dexamethasone and other 
corticosteroids metabolized by 
CYP3A. 
Co-administration with 
dexamethasone or other 
corticosteroids (all routes of 
administration) that induce 
CYP3A may result in loss of 
therapeutic effect of 
EVOTAZ and development 
of resistance to atazanavir. 
The mechanism of 
interaction is CYP3A4 
induction by dexamethasone 
and CYP3A4 inhibition by 
atazanavir and/or cobicistat. 
Co-administration with 
corticosteroids that are metabolized 
by CYP3A, particularly for 
long-term use, may increase the risk 
for development of systemic 
corticosteroid effects including 
Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal 
suppression. The potential benefit of 
treatment versus the risk of systemic 
corticosteroid effects should be 
considered. 
For co-administration of 
cutaneously administered 
corticosteroids sensitive to CYP3A4 
inhibition, consult the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of the 
corticosteroid for condition or uses 
that augment its systemic 
absorption. 
Concomitant use of EVOTAZ and 
corticosteroids that are metabolised 
by CYP3A (e.g. fluticasone 
propionate or other inhaled or nasal 
corticosteroids) may increase the 
risk of development of systemic 
corticosteroid effects, including 
Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal 
suppression. 
Co-administration with CYP3A-
metabolised corticosteroids is not 
recommended unless the potential 
benefit to the patient outweighs the 
risk, in which case patients should 
be monitored for systemic 
corticosteroid effects. Alternative 
corticosteroids which are less 
dependent on CYP3A metabolism, 
e.g. beclomethasone for intranasal 
or inhalational use, should be 
considered, particularly for 
long-term use. 
Corticosteroids primarily 
metabolised by CYP3A 
(including betamethasone,

when co-administered with 
EVOTAZ. 
The mechanism of 
interaction is CYP3A4 
inhibition by atazanavir and 
cobicistat. 
Sildenafil, tadalafil, and 
vardenafil are metabolised 
by CYP3A4. 
Co-administration with 
EVOTAZ may result in 
increased concentrations of 
the PDE5 inhibitor and an 
increase in PDE5-associated 
adverse events, including 
hypotension, visual changes, 
and priapism. 
The mechanism of this 
interaction is CYP3A4 
inhibition by atazanavir and 
cobicistat. 
If trazodone is co-administered 
with EVOTAZ, the combination 
should be used with caution and a 
lower dose of trazodone should be 
considered. 
Patients should be warned about 
these possible side effects when 
using PDE5 inhibitors for erectile 
dysfunction with EVOTAZ (see 
section 4.4). 
For the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction, it is recommended 
that when co-administered with 
EVOTAZ, sildenafil should be 
used with caution at reduced doses 
of 25 mg every 48 hours; tadalafil 
should be used with caution at 
reduced doses of 10 mg every 
72 hours; vardenafil should be used 
with caution at reduced doses of no 
more than 2.5 mg every 72 hours. 
Increase monitoring for adverse

section 4.3). 
Concomitant use of St. 
John's wort with EVOTAZ 
may be expected to result in 
significant reduction in 
plasma levels of cobicistat

may be due to an induction 
of CYP3A4. There is a risk 
of loss of therapeutic effect 
and development of 
resistance to atazanavir (see 
section 4.3). 
HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES 
Progestin/estrogen 
Concentrations of ethinyl 
estradiol and norethindrone 
are increased when a 
combined oral contraceptive 
containing those agents is 
co-administered with

SEDATIVES/HYPNOTICS 
Midazolam 
Triazolam 
The mechanism of 
interaction is CYP3A4 
inhibition by atazanavir and 
cobicistat. 
Midazolam and triazolam are 
extensively metabolized by 
CYP3A4. Co-administration 
with EVOTAZ may cause a 
large increase in the 
concentration of these 
benzodiazepines. Based on 
data for other CYP3A4 
inhibitors, plasma 
concentrations of midazolam 
are expected to be 
significantly higher when 
midazolam is given orally. 
Data from concomitant use 
of parenteral midazolam 
with other protease inhibitors 
suggest a possible 3-4-fold 
increase in midazolam 
plasma levels. 
EVOTAZ should not be 
co-administered with triazolam or 
orally administered midazolam (see 
section 4.3), whereas caution 
should be used with 
co-administration of EVOTAZ and 
parenteral midazolam. If EVOTAZ 
is co-administered with parenteral 
midazolam, it should be done in an 
intensive care unit (ICU) or similar 
setting which ensures close clinical 
monitoring and appropriate 
medical management in case of 
respiratory depression and/or 
prolonged sedation. Dosage 
adjustment for midazolam should 
be considered, especially if more 
than a single dose of midazolam is 
administered.

Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
EVOTAZ is not recommended during pregnancy nor should it be initiated in pregnant patients; an 
alternative regimen is recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). This is due to substantially lower 
exposures of cobicistat and consequently, lower exposures of co-administered antiretroviral agents, 
including atazanavir, during the second and third trimesters, compared to postpartum. 
Animal studies with EVOTAZ are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Breast-feeding 
Atazanavir, an active component of EVOTAZ, has been detected in human milk. It is unknown if 
cobicistat/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Studies in animals have shown excretion of 
cobicistat/metabolites in milk. Because of both the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for 
serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding infants, women should be instructed not to breast-feed if 
they are receiving EVOTAZ. 
Fertility 
The effect of EVOTAZ on fertility in humans has not been studied. In a nonclinical fertility and early 
embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus cycling with no effects on mating or 
fertility (see section 5.3). No human data on the effect of cobicistat on fertility are available. Animal 
studies do not indicate harmful effects of cobicistat on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
EVOTAZ has a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Dizziness may occur 
following administration of regimens containing atazanavir and cobicistat (see section 4.8).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The overall safety profile of EVOTAZ is based on available data from clinical trials conducted with 
atazanavir, atazanavir boosted with either cobicistat or ritonavir, and post-marketing data. 
As EVOTAZ contains atazanavir and cobicistat, the adverse reactions associated with each of the 
individual components may be expected. 
In a Phase III study (GS-US-216-0114), the most frequently reported adverse reactions in the 
atazanavir boosted with cobicistat group were associated with elevated bilirubin levels (see Table 2). 
In two controlled clinical trials, where subjects received atazanavir alone (400 mg once daily) or 
atazanavir (300 mg daily) boosted with ritonavir (100 mg daily), the most frequently reported adverse 
reactions were nausea, diarrhoea and jaundice. In the majority of cases, jaundice was reported within a 
few days to a few months after the initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Chronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has 
been reported during postmarketing surveillance (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency: very common (≥ 1/10), common 
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 1/1,000). Within each 
frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

a These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance; however, the frequencies were 
estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to atazanavir (with and 
without ritonavir) in randomised controlled and other available clinical trials (n = 2321). 
b See section Description of selected adverse reactions for more details. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune reactivation syndrome and autoimmune disorders 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have 
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur 
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Osteonecrosis 
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown 
(see section 4.4). 
35 
 
 
 
 
Metabolic parameters 
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy 
(see section 4.4). 
Rash and associated syndromes 
Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks 
of starting therapy with atazanavir. 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with the use of 
atazanavir (see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
Cobicistat, a component of EVOTAZ, has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due 
to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine. An increase from baseline in serum creatinine solely 
due to cobicistat’s inhibitory effect generally does not exceed 0.4 mg/dL. 
In study GS-US-216-0114, decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in treatment 
with cobicistat, after which they stabilised. The mean (± SD) change in estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) by Cockcroft-Gault method after 144 weeks of treatment was -15.1 ± 16.5 mL/min in the 
atazanavir boosted with cobicistat plus emtricitabine and tenofovir DF fixed-dose combination group 
and -8.0 ± 16.8 mL/min in the atazanavir boosted with ritonavir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir DF 
fixed-dose combination group. 
Effects on the liver 
In study GS-US-216-0114, through 144 weeks of treatment hyperbilirubinaemia (> 1 x ULN) was 
common: 97.7% in the atazanavir boosted with cobicistat plus emtricitabine and tenofovir DF 
fixed-dose combination group, and 97.4% in the atazanavir boosted with ritonavir plus emtricitabine 
and tenofovir DF fixed-dose combination group. However, a higher percentage of subjects in the 
atazanavir boosted with cobicistat group had increases in total bilirubin > 2 x ULN than those in the 
atazanavir boosted with ritonavir group (88.0% versus 80.9%). The rates of study drug discontinuation 
due to bilirubin-related adverse events were low and similar in both groups (4.9% in the 
cobicistat-boosted group and 4.0% in the ritonavir-boosted group). An increase of > 3 x ULN in 
alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase was recorded in 12.8% of subjects in the 
cobicistat-boosted group and 9.0% in the ritonavir-boosted group. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
The most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in patients receiving regimens containing 
atazanavir and one or more NRTIs was elevated total bilirubin reported predominantly as elevated 
indirect [unconjugated] bilirubin (87% Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4). Grade 3 or 4 elevation of total bilirubin 
was noted in 37% (6% Grade 4). Among experienced patients treated with atazanavir 300 mg once 
daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily for a median duration of 95 weeks, 53% had Grade 3-4 total 
bilirubin elevations. Among naïve patients treated with atazanavir 300 mg once daily with 100 mg 
ritonavir once daily for a median duration of 96 weeks, 48% had Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations 
(see section 4.4). 
Other marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in ≥ 2% of patients receiving 
regimens containing atazanavir and one or more NRTIs included: elevated creatine kinase (7%), 
elevated alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) (5%), low 
neutrophils (5%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 
(AST/SGOT) (3%), and elevated lipase (3%). 
Two percent of patients treated with atazanavir experienced concurrent Grade 3-4 ALT/AST and 
Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric patients aged 3 months to < 12 years 
In clinical studies, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 18 years of age had a mean duration of 
treatment with atazanavir of 115 weeks. The safety profile in these studies was overall comparable to 
that seen in adults. Both asymptomatic first-degree (23%) and second-degree (1%) atrioventricular 
block were reported in paediatric patients. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in 
paediatric patients receiving atazanavir was elevation of total bilirubin (≥ 2.6 times ULN, Grade 3-4) 
which occurred in 45% of patients. 
Paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing more than 35 kg 
The safety of atazanavir administered with cobicistat plus two NRTIs (N = 14) was evaluated in 
HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed paediatric patients between the ages of 12 to < 18 years 
through 48 weeks in an open-label clinical study (GS-US-216-0128). In this study, the safety profile of 
atazanavir and cobicistat was similar to that in adults. 
Other special populations 
Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus 
Co-infected patients with hepatitis B and/or C were more likely to have baseline hepatic transaminase 
elevations than those without chronic viral hepatitis. No differences in frequency of bilirubin 
elevations were observed between these patients and those without viral hepatitis. The frequency of 
treatment emergent hepatitis or transaminase elevations in co-infected patients was comparable 
between atazanavir and comparator regimens (see section 4.4). 
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus co-infection: 
In GS-US-216-0114, 3.6% of subjects were hepatitis B virus surface antigen positive and 5.3% were 
hepatitis C virus seropositive. Subjects with significant liver function test abnormalities generally had 
abnormal baseline transaminases (AST or ALT), underlying chronic or acute hepatitis B or C 
co-infection, concomitant hepatotoxic medicinal products (e.g., isoniazid), or a medical history of 
alcoholism or alcohol abuse. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Human experience of acute overdose with EVOTAZ is limited. 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with EVOTAZ. If overdose occurs with EVOTAZ, the 
patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment should consist of general supportive 
measures including monitoring of vital signs and ECG as well as observation of the patient’s clinical 
status. Since atazanavir and cobicistat are extensively metabolised by the liver and highly protein 
bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of this medicinal product.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, 
combinations. ATC code: J05AR15 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
EVOTAZ is a fixed-dose combination of the antiviral drug atazanavir boosted by the pharmacokinetic 
enhancer cobicistat. 
Atazanavir 
Atazanavir is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI). The compound selectively inhibits the 
virus-specific processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation 
of mature virions and infection of other cells. 
Cobicistat 
Cobicistat is a selective, mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochromes P450 of the CYP3A subfamily. 
Inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat enhances the systemic exposure of CYP3A 
substrates, such as atazanavir, where bioavailability is limited and half-life is shortened by 
CYP3A-dependent metabolism. 
Antiviral activity in vitro 
Atazanavir 
Atazanavir exhibits anti-HIV-1 (including all clades tested) and anti-HIV-2 activity in cell culture. 
Cobicistat 
Cobicistat has no antiviral activity. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Effect of cobicistat on atazanavir pharmacokinetics 
The antiretroviral effect of EVOTAZ is due to the atazanavir component. The activity of cobicistat as 
a pharmacokinetic enhancer to atazanavir has been demonstrated in pharmacokinetic trials. In these 
pharmacokinetic trials, the exposure of atazanavir 300 mg with cobicistat 150 mg was consistent with 
that observed when boosted with ritonavir 100 mg. EVOTAZ is bioequivalent to atazanavir 300 mg 
once daily in combination with cobicistat 150 mg once daily coadministered as single agents (see 
section 5.2). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients 
The safety and efficacy of atazanavir with cobicistat in HIV-1 infected patients were evaluated in the 
randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 3 study GS-US-216-0114 in HIV-1 infected 
patients with baseline estimated creatinine clearance above 70 mL/min who were treatment-naïve 
(n = 692). 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atazanavir 300 mg with cobicistat 150 mg 
once daily or atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, each administered with a fixed 
background regimen containing tenofovir DF 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg administered as a 
fixed-dose combination tablet. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA level 
(≤ 100,000 copies/mL or > 100,000 copies/mL). Virologic response rate was evaluated in both 
treatment arms and virologic response was defined as achieving an undetectable viral load 
(< 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL). Viruses were known to be susceptible to atazanavir, emtricitabine and 
tenofovir DF at baseline. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the atazanavir with cobicistat and 
atazanavir with ritonavir groups. The median age of subjects was 36 years (range: 19-70). The median 
baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.81 log10 copies/mL (range: 3.21-6.44). The median baseline CD4+ 
cell count was 352 cells/mm3 (range: 1-1455) and 16.9% had CD4+ cell counts ≤ 200 cells/mm3. The 
percentage of subjects with baseline viral loads > 100,000 copies/mL was 39.7%. Treatment outcomes 
at Weeks 48 and 144 for study GS-US-216-0114 are presented in Table 3.

f Plus background regimen of emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg fixed-dose combination. 
Atazanavir with cobicistat and emtricitabine and tenofovir DF fixed-dose combination was 
non-inferior in achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL when compared to atazanavir with ritonavir and 
emtricitabine and tenofovir DF fixed-dose combination. 
In study GS-US-216-0114, the mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Weeks 48 and 144 
were 213 and 310 cells/mm3 in patients receiving atazanavir boosted with cobicistat and 219 and 
332 cells/mm3 in patients receiving atazanavir boosted with ritonavir, respectively. 
Resistance 
The resistance profile of EVOTAZ is driven by atazanavir. Cobicistat does not select any HIV 
resistance mutations, due to its lack of antiviral activity. 
Atazanavir 
In clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment naive patients treated with unboosted atazanavir, the I50L 
substitution, sometimes in combination with an A71V change, is the signature resistance substitution 
for atazanavir. Resistance levels to atazanavir ranged from 3.5- to 29-fold without evidence of 
phenotypic cross resistance to other PIs. For more information consult the REYATAZ Summary of 
Product Characteristics. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atazanavir with cobicistat 
Limited data are available on the development of resistance to atazanavir boosted with cobicistat. 
In an analysis of treatment-failure subjects who received atazanavir 300 mg co-administered with 
cobicistat 150 mg in study GS-US-216-0114 through Week 144, evaluable genotypic data from paired 
baseline and treatment-failure isolates were available for all 21 virologic failures in this group (6%, 
21/344). Among the 21 subjects, 3 developed the emtricitabine-associated resistance substitution 
M184V. No subject developed the tenofovir-associated resistance substitution K65R or K70E or any 
primary resistance substitution associated with protease inhibitors. In the group receiving atazanavir 
300 mg co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg, evaluable genotypic data was available for all 
19 virologic failures (5%, 19/348). Among the 19 patients, 1 developed the emtricitabine-associated 
resistance substitution M184V with no tenofovir or protease inhibitor associated resistance 
substitutions. 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric patients aged 3 months to < 12 years or weighing less than 35 kg 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
EVOTAZ in the treatment of HIV-1 infection (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing more than 35 kg 
The safety and efficacy of atazanavir with cobicistat were evaluated in an open-label phase 2/3 Study 
GS-US-216-0128 in HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed paediatric patients between the ages of 
12 and < 18 years with baseline estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 90 mL/min. Fourteen patients 
received atazanavir 300 mg once daily with cobicistat 150 mg once daily administered with a 
background regimen containing two NRTIs. 
The median age of patients was 14 years (range: 12 to 17); median weight of patients was 52.7 kg 
(range: 46.5 to 63.3); 71% were male; 57% were Asian, 29% were White, and 14% were Black. At 
baseline, 13/14 subjects had plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL and 1 subject had plasma HIV-1 
RNA = 50 copies/mL. 
In patients treated with atazanavir + cobicistat, the median baseline CD4+ cell count and CD4+% was 
770 cells/mm3 (range: 486 to 1765) and 33% (range: 23% to 45%), respectively. At Week 48, 93% 
(13/14) of patients retained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL and the median change from baseline in 
CD4+ cell count and CD4+% was -60 cells/mm3 and -0.3%, respectively. Three out of 14 patients 
qualified for resistance analysis: 1 patient showed no resistance in protease or reverse transcriptase and 
2 had missing data due to assay failure. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
One EVOTAZ tablet is bioequivalent to one atazanavir capsule (300 mg) plus one cobicistat tablet 
(150 mg) following single oral dose administration with a light meal in healthy subjects (n = 62). 
The following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of atazanavir in combination with 
cobicistat or the individual components of EVOTAZ. 
Absorption 
In a trial where HIV-infected subjects (n = 22) were instructed to take atazanavir 300 mg with 
cobicistat 150 mg once daily with food, the steady-state atazanavir Cmax, AUCtau and Ctau (mean ± SD) 
values were 3.9 ± 1.9 mcg/mL, 46.1 ± 26.2 mcg•hr/mL and 0.80 ± 0.72 mcg/mL, respectively. 
Steady-state cobicistat Cmax, AUCtau and Ctau (mean ± SD) values were 1.5 ± 0.5 mcg/mL, 
11.1 ± 4.5 mcg•hr/mL and 0.05 ± 0.07 mcg/mL, respectively (n = 22). 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Food effect 
Administration of a single dose of EVOTAZ with a light meal (336 kcal, 5.1 g fat, 9.3 g protein) 
resulted in a 42% increase in atazanavir Cmax, a 28% increase in atazanavir AUC, a 31% increase in 
cobicistat Cmax, and a 24% increase in cobicistat AUC relative to the fasting state. Administration of a 
single dose of EVOTAZ with a high-fat meal (1,038 kcal, 59 g fat, 37 g protein) resulted in a 14% 
reduction in atazanavir Cmax with no change in atazanavir AUC or cobicistat exposures (Cmax, AUC) 
relative to the fasting state. The 24-hour atazanavir concentration following a high-fat meal was 
increased approximately 23% due to delayed absorption; the median Tmax increased from 2.0 to 
3.5 hours. Cmax and AUCs after a high-fat meal decreased 36% and 25% in comparison to a light meal, 
respectively; however, the 24-hour atazanavir concentration was similar when EVOTAZ was given 
with a light meal and a high-fat meal. To enhance bioavailability, EVOTAZ is to be taken with food. 
Distribution 
Atazanavir 
Atazanavir was approximately 86% bound to human serum proteins over a concentration range of 100 
to 10,000 ng/mL. Atazanavir binds to both alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin to a similar 
extent (89% and 86%, respectively, at 1,000 ng/mL). In a multiple-dose study in HIV-infected patients 
dosed with 400 mg of atazanavir once daily with a light meal for 12 weeks, atazanavir was detected in 
the cerebrospinal fluid and semen. 
Cobicistat 
Cobicistat is 97-98% bound to human plasma proteins and the mean plasma to blood drug 
concentration ratio was 2. 
Biotransformation 
Atazanavir 
Studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that 
atazanavir is principally metabolised by CYP3A4 isozyme to oxygenated metabolites. Metabolites are 
then excreted in the bile as either free or glucuronidated metabolites. Additional minor metabolic 
pathways consist of N-dealkylation and hydrolysis. Two minor metabolites of atazanavir in plasma 
have been characterised. Neither metabolite demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity. 
Cobicistat 
Cobicistat is metabolised via CYP3A (major)- and CYP2D6 (minor)-mediated oxidation and does not 
undergo glucuronidation. Following oral administration of [14C]cobicistat, 99% of circulating 
radioactivity in plasma was unchanged cobicistat. Low levels of metabolites are observed in urine and 
faeces and do not contribute to the CYP3A inhibitory activity of cobicistat. 
Elimination 
Atazanavir 
Following a single 400 mg dose of [14C]atazanavir, 79% and 13% of the total radioactivity was 
recovered in the faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged drug accounted for approximately 20% and 
7% of the administered dose in the faeces and urine, respectively. Mean urinary excretion of 
unchanged drug was 7% following 2 weeks of dosing at 800 mg once daily. In HIV-infected adult 
patients (n = 33, combined studies), the mean half-life within a dosing interval for atazanavir was 
12 hours at steady state following a dose of 300 mg daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with a light 
meal. 
Cobicistat 
Following oral administration of [14C]cobicistat, 86% and 8.2% of the dose were recovered in faeces 
and urine, respectively. The median terminal plasma half-life of cobicistat following administration of 
cobicistat is approximately 3-4 hours. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Atazanavir 
Atazanavir demonstrates nonlinear pharmacokinetics with greater than dose-proportional increases in 
AUC and Cmax values over the dose range of 200 mg to 800 mg once daily. 
Cobicistat 
Cobicistat exposures are non-linear and greater than dose-proportional over the range of 50 mg to 
400 mg, consistent with a mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Atazanavir 
In healthy subjects, the renal elimination of unchanged atazanavir was approximately 7% of the 
administered dose. There are no pharmacokinetic data available for atazanavir in combination with 
cobicistat in patients with renal insufficiency. Atazanavir has been studied in adult patients with severe 
renal impairment (n = 20), including those on haemodialysis, at multiple doses of 400 mg once daily. 
Although this study presented some limitations (i.e., unbound drug concentrations not studied), results 
suggested that the atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters were decreased by 30% to 50% in patients 
undergoing haemodialysis compared to patients with normal renal function. The mechanism of this 
decrease is unknown (see sections 4.2 and 4.4.) 
Cobicistat 
A study of the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with 
severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min). No meaningful 
differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with severe renal 
impairment and healthy subjects, consistent with low renal clearance of cobicistat. 
Hepatic impairment 
Atazanavir 
Atazanavir is metabolised and eliminated primarily by the liver. The effects of hepatic impairment on 
the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir given with cobicistat have not been studied. Concentrations of 
atazanavir given with cobicistat are expected to be increased in patients with impaired hepatic function 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Cobicistat 
Cobicistat is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. A study of the pharmacokinetics of 
cobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class B). No clinically relevant differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed 
between subjects with moderate impairment and healthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat has not been studied. 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir and cobicistat, alone or in combination, have not been evaluated 
in an elderly population (65 years of age and older). 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric Patients aged 3 months to < 12 years 
For paediatric patients aged 3 months to < 12 years, no data are available on the pharmacokinetics of 
atazanavir and cobicistat in combination. 
Paediatric Patients aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing more than 35 kg 
In paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years who received cobicistat-boosted atazanavir (n = 14) in 
Study GS-US-216-0128, exposures of atazanavir and cobicistat (AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctrough) were higher 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(24% to 180%) than in adults; however, the increases were not considered clinically significant as the 
safety profiles were similar in adult and paediatric patients. 
Gender 
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been identified for atazanavir or 
cobicistat. 
Race 
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to ethnicity have been identified for atazanavir 
or cobicistat. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In a 3-month combination oral toxicity study of atazanavir and cobicistat in rats, there were no 
toxicologic interactions apparent as no additive or synergistic toxicities were observed. When 
compared to their single-agent profiles all findings could be attributed to either atazanavir or 
cobicistat. 
In an ex vivo rabbit pharmacology study, isolated hearts were exposed to atazanavir, cobicistat, or 
atazanavir and cobicistat in combination. Each single agent produced effects on left ventricular 
contractility and PR prolongation at concentrations at least 35-fold higher than the free atazanavir and 
cobicistat concentrations at the recommended human dose (RHD) Cmax. When administered in 
combination, no clear additive or synergistic cardiovascular effects were observed at atazanavir and 
cobicistat concentrations at least 2-fold higher than the free atazanavir and cobicistat concentrations at 
the RHD Cmax. 
The following statements reflect the preclinical safety results of the individual active substances of 
EVOTAZ. 
Atazanavir 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies, conducted in mice, rats, and dogs, atazanavir-related findings were 
generally confined to the liver and included generally minimal to mild increases in serum bilirubin and 
liver enzymes, hepatocellular vacuolation and hypertrophy, and, in female mice only, hepatic 
single-cell necrosis. Systemic exposures of atazanavir in mice (males), rats, and dogs at doses 
associated with hepatic changes were at least equal to that observed in humans given 400 mg 
once daily. In female mice, atazanavir exposure at a dose that produced single-cell necrosis was 
12 times the exposure in humans given 400 mg once daily. Serum cholesterol and glucose were 
minimally to mildly increased in rats but not in mice or dogs. 
During in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channel (hERG), was inhibited by 15% at a 
concentration (30 μM) of atazanavir corresponding to 30-fold the free drug concentration at Cmax in 
humans. Similar concentrations of atazanavir increased by 13% the action potential duration (APD90) 
in rabbit Purkinje fibres study. Electrocardiographic changes (sinus bradycardia, prolongation of PR 
interval, prolongation of QT interval, and prolongation of QRS complex) were observed only in an 
initial 2-week oral toxicity study performed in dogs. Subsequent 9-month oral toxicity studies in dogs 
showed no drug-related electrocardiographic changes. The clinical relevance of these non-clinical data 
is unknown. Potential cardiac effects of this product in humans cannot be ruled out (see sections 4.4 
and 4.8). The potential for PR prolongation should be considered in cases of overdose 
(see section 4.9). 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus cycling with no 
effects on mating or fertility. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats or rabbits at maternally toxic 
doses. In pregnant rabbits, gross lesions of the stomach and intestines were observed in dead or 
moribund does at maternal doses 2 and 4 times the highest dose administered in the definitive 
embryo-development study. In the pre- and postnatal development assessment in rats, atazanavir 
produced a transient reduction in body weight in the offspring at a maternally toxic dose. Systemic 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exposure to atazanavir at doses that resulted in maternal toxicity was at least equal to or slightly 
greater than that observed in humans given 400 mg once daily. 
Atazanavir was negative in an Ames reverse-mutation assay but did induce chromosomal aberrations 
in vitro in both the absence and presence of metabolic activation. In in vivo studies in rats, atazanavir 
did not induce micronuclei in bone marrow, DNA damage in duodenum (comet assay), or unscheduled 
DNA repair in liver at plasma and tissue concentrations exceeding those that were clastogenic in vitro. 
In long-term carcinogenicity studies of atazanavir in mice and rats, an increased incidence of benign 
hepatic adenomas was seen in female mice only. The increased incidence of benign hepatic adenomas 
in female mice was likely secondary to cytotoxic liver changes manifested by single-cell necrosis and 
is considered to have no relevance for humans at intended therapeutic exposures. There were no 
tumorigenic findings in male mice or in rats. 
Atazanavir increased opacity of bovine corneas in an in vitro ocular irritation study, indicating it may 
be an ocular irritant upon direct contact with the eye. 
Cobicistat 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development. No teratogenic effects were 
observed in rats and rabbit developmental toxicity studies. In rats, ossification changes in the spinal 
column and sternebra of foetuses occurred at a dose that produced significant maternal toxicity. 
Ex vivo rabbit studies and in vivo dog studies suggest that cobicistat has a low potential for QT 
prolongation, and may slightly prolong the PR interval and decrease left ventricular function at mean 
concentrations at least 10-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended 150 mg daily 
dose. 
A long-term carcinogenicity study of cobicistat in rats revealed tumourigenic potential specific for this 
species that is regarded as of no relevance for humans. A long-term carcinogenicity study in mice did 
not show any carcinogenic potential.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What EVOTAZ is and what it is used for 
 
 
 
EVOTAZ contains two active substances: 
 
atazanavir, an antiviral (or antiretroviral) medicine. It is one of a group called protease 
inhibitors. These medicines control human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by stopping 
production of a protein that HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount 
of HIV in your body and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way atazanavir 
reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection. 
cobicistat, a booster (pharmacokinetic enhancer) to help improve the effects of atazanavir. 
Cobicistat, does not directly treat your HIV, but boosts the levels of atazanavir in the blood. It 
does this by slowing down the breakdown of atazanavir which will make it stay in the body for 
longer. 
EVOTAZ may be used by adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older weighing at least 35 kg), 
who are infected with HIV, the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is 
used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines to help control your HIV infection. Your doctor 
will discuss with you which combination of these medicines with EVOTAZ is best for you. 
2.  What you need to know before you take EVOTAZ

Do not take sildenafil with EVOTAZ when sildenafil is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor if you 
are using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. 
Tell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some people will need special care before or while taking EVOTAZ. Talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking EVOTAZ. 
EVOTAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other illnesses 
linked to HIV infection. 
Make sure your doctor knows: 
 
 
if you have liver problems 
if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain in your right side). Gall stones have been 
reported in patients taking atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ. 
if you have type A or B haemophilia. You may notice increased bleeding. 
if you have problems with your kidneys or require haemodialysis. Kidney stones have been 
reported in patients taking atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ. If you develop signs or 
symptoms of kidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), 
please inform your doctor immediately 
if you are taking oral contraceptives ("the Pill") to prevent pregnancy. If you are currently 
using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, you should use 
an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom) 
 
 
 
In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs 
and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the 
opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system 
attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your 
HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in 
hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, 
please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. 
Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called 
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of 
combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for 
developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the 
hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please 
inform your doctor. 
Hyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients 
receiving EVOTAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of these 
symptoms please inform your doctor. 
Serious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, may develop in patients taking EVOTAZ. If 
you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately. 
EVOTAZ may affect how well your kidneys work. 
If you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. 
Children 
Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age or who weigh less than 35 kg, as the 
use of EVOTAZ was not studied in this population. 
Other medicines and EVOTAZ 
You must not take EVOTAZ with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take EVOTAZ, 
at the start of section 2. 
There are other medicines that may not be taken together or may require a change in their mode of 
administration when taken with EVOTAZ. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have 
recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is especially important to mention these: 
 
 
medicines containing ritonavir or cobicistat (booster agents) 
other medicines to treat HIV infection (e.g. indinavir, didanosine, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir 
alafenamide, efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine and maraviroc)

It is important to tell your doctor if you are taking: corticosteroids including dexamethasone, 
betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, triamcinolone. These medicines are 
used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel diseases, inflammatory conditions of the eyes, 
joints and muscles and other inflammatory conditions. If alternatives cannot be used, its use should 
only take place after medical evaluation and under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid 
side effects. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
EVOTAZ should not be used during pregnancy, because the drug levels in your blood may be lower 
during pregnancy and may no longer be high enough to control HIV. Your doctor may prescribe 
different medicines if you become pregnant while taking EVOTAZ. 
Atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ is excreted in human milk. It is unknown if cobicistat, the other 
component of EVOTAZ, is excreted in human milk but it has been shown in animals that it is excreted 
in milk. Patients should not breast-feed while taking EVOTAZ. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. 
Driving and using machines 
Some patients have reported dizziness when taking atazanavir or cobicistat, active substances of 
EVOTAZ. If you feel dizzy or lightheaded, do not drive, use any tools or use machines and contact 
your doctor immediately. 
3. 
How to take EVOTAZ 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. This way, you can be sure your medicine is fully effective and you reduce the risk of the 
HIV-virus developing resistance to the treatment. 
The recommended adult and adolescent (aged 12 years and older weighing at least 35 kg) dose of 
EVOTAZ is one tablet daily by mouth and with food, in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. 
The tablets have a poor taste, therefore swallow the tablet whole; do not crush or chew the tablets. 
This will help ensure you get the full dose. 
If you take more EVOTAZ than you should 
If you accidentally take more EVOTAZ than your doctor recommended, contact your doctor at once or 
contact the nearest hospital for advice. 
If you forget to take EVOTAZ 
If you miss a dose of EVOTAZ by 12 hours or less, take it right away with food and then take your 
next scheduled dose at the usual time. If you miss a dose and it is more than 12 hours from the time 
you should have taken EVOTAZ, do not take the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose at the usual 
time. Do not double the next dose. It is important that you do not miss any doses of EVOTAZ or your 
other anti-HIV medicines. 
If you stop taking EVOTAZ 
Do not stop taking EVOTAZ before talking to your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

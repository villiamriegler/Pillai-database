2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Background of the disease 
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is common among patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) 
(USRDS, 2009).  Secondary HPT is characterized by persistently elevated levels of parathyroid hormone 
(PTH) in blood caused by the ongoing release of excess amounts of PTH from enlarged parathyroid glands 
(Goodman and Quarles, 2008; Parfitt, 1997) due to low calcium serum levels.  Secondary HPT is a chronic, 
progressive disease that develops early during the course of CKD, worsens as kidney function decreases over 
time, and affects a majority of patients with advanced kidney disease.   
The development of secondary HPT among subjects with CKD represents an early adaptive response that 
serves initially to maintain calcium homeostasis as kidney function declines leading to a decreased ability to 
resorb calcium.  As CKD progresses and associated metabolic disturbances become more pronounced, 
enlargement of the parathyroid glands due to tissue hyperplasia contributes to disease progression and 
severity (Goodman and Quarles, 2008). 
European countries that are part of the European Renal Association–European Dialysis and Transplant 
Association (ERA-EDTA) registry reported over 450,000 patients with ESRD who were receiving renal 
replacement therapy with most patients receiving dialysis (Pippias et al, 2015).  Worldwide, the number of 
patients with CKD receiving dialysis exceeds 1 million.  The large majority of these individuals receive 
haemodialysis as renal replacement therapy (USRDS, 2014).  Secondary HPT is a major burden for the large 
number of patients with CKD receiving dialysis.   
For patients with CKD receiving dialysis, important clinical consequences of secondary HPT and the 
accompanying metabolic disruptions in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis include pathological changes in 
bone, reductions in bone mass, increased risk of skeletal fracture, soft-tissue and vascular calcification, left 
ventricular hypertrophy, and a greater risk for cardiovascular events (USRDS, 2009; Moe, 2001; Alem et al, 
2000; Block and Port, 2000; Diaz-Corte and Cannata-Andia, 2000; Slatopolsky et al, 1980).   
Therapeutic options 
Several therapeutic strategies have been used to lower elevated PTH levels and manage the disturbance in 
calcium and phosphorus homeostasis among patients with secondary HPT and CKD (KDIGO, 2009; Saliba and 
El-Haddad, 2009; Locatelli et al, 2008).  Traditionally, most therapeutic regimens have employed treatment 
with vitamin D sterols such as calcitriol or synthetic vitamin D analogues.   
While vitamin D sterols may reduce PTH levels, they are limited by the development of hypercalcaemia and 
hyperphosphatemia due to enhanced gastrointestinal absorption.  These agents are contraindicated in 
patients with pre-existing hypercalcaemia.  The product labels also include cautionary statements regarding 
the risk of vascular or metastatic calcification as well as potential toxicity of hypercalcaemia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 8/98 
  
  
An alternative approach to treating secondary HPT is to enhance signal transduction through the calcium-
sensing receptor (CaSR) in parathyroid tissue. Calcimimetics target the CaSR in parathyroid tissue (Brown 
and Hebert, 1996; Brown et al, 1993).  Cinacalcet is the only calcimimetic currently approved for the 
treatment of secondary HPT in patients with CKD undergoing dialysis.  It is a recommended intervention for 
reducing elevated PTH levels among patients with CKD receiving dialysis as stated in clinical practice 
guidelines developed by the International Society of Nephrology Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 
(KDIGO) (KDIGO, 2009).  Cinacalcet is a small molecule, available in tablet form for oral administration once 
daily (QD).   
Problem statement 
Because of its oral route of administration, cinacalcet is susceptible to suboptimal medication adherence, a 
common problem in CKD patients who have a high daily pill burden (Chiu et al, 2009).   
Given the effectiveness of calcimimetics in reducing PTH, there is a medical need for a calcimimetic that can 
be administered by the i.v. route of administration during or after haemodialysis treatment, thereby 
addressing the adherence problem associated with oral cinacalcet in patients with a large pill burden. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Product type and proposed mechanism of action 
Etelcalcetide (also sometimes referred to as AMG 416 throughout the text, also formerly identified as KAI 
4169) is a calcimimetic being developed for the treatment of secondary HPT in patients with CKD receiving 
haemodialysis.  Etelcalcetide is a synthetic peptide comprised of 7 D-amino acids linked to an L-cysteine via a 
disulfide bond that acts as an allosteric activator of the CaSR. It binds directly to the extracellular domain and 
activates the receptor at a site which is distinct from the calcium activating site.  This suppresses secretion of 
PTH due to an increased sensitivity of the CaSR receptor to calcium, leading to a decrease in calcium levels. 
Dose recommendation 
Etelcalcetide (AMG 416) is the only calcimimetic formulated for i.v. administration.  The recommended initial 
dose of etelcalcetide is 5 mg.  Etelcalcetide is administered TIW as a bolus dose at the end of the 
haemodialysis treatment during rinseback or i.v. after rinseback. Parsabiv should be titrated so that doses 
are individualised between 2.5 mg and 15 mg.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection containing 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 mg of etelcalcetide 
(as hydrochloride salt) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are sodium chloride, succinic acid, water for injection, hydrochloric acid (for pH 
adjustment) and sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment).

The product is available in type I glass vials with fluoropolymer laminated elastomeric stoppers and 
aluminium seals with flip-off dust covers as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of etelcalcetide hydrochloride is N-acetyl-D-cysteinyl-S-(L-cysteine disulfide)-D-alanyl-D-
arginyl-D-arginyl-D-arginyl-D-alanyl-D-argininamide hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula 
C 38H73N21O10S2.xHCl (4≤x≤5) and a relative molecular mass of 1208.7 g/mol (where x = 4.4). It has the 
following structure: 
The structure of etelcalcetide was inferred from the synthetic process and starting materials and confirmed 
using a combination of amino acid analysis, elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, 1H-, 13C- and 15N-NMR 
spectroscopy (1D, 2D and NOE), chiral amino acid analysis and UV/Vis spectroscopy. 
The active substance is a very hygroscopic, white to off-white, amorphous solid, freely soluble in aqueous 
media and polar organic solvents. The aqueous solubility ensures complete dissolution on formulation. 
Etelcalcetide contains eight chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is controlled by optical rotation. Any 
racemisation during the synthetic process would result in diastereomers, the most common of which are 
separable by the HPLC method. 
Etelcalcetide is amorphous and no crystalline form has as yet been identified. The amorphous nature of the 
active substance is ensured by the final lyophilisation process. 
Etelcalcetide is considered to be a new active substance. The applicant demonstrated that neither it, nor its 
derivatives and salts have ever been active substances in products authorised in Europe. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
A single manufacturer carries out the entire process. Etelcalcetide hydrochloride is synthesized in five main 
steps using commercially available, well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. Standard 
solid phase peptide synthesis is used and the active substance is built from protected amino acids on amide 
resin. Following cleavage from the resin, the cysteine residue is coupled, followed by several chromatographic 
purification steps which ensure impurities are removed to acceptable levels. The final step is formation of the 
hydrochloridesalt and lyophilisation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 10/98 
  
  
 
The process was developed using a QbD approach although no design space or other regulatory flexibility is 
requested. Risk assessments were carried out, building on prior process knowledge and using tools such as 
failure mode effects analysis (FMEA) to identify critical steps in the process. Critical process parameters 
(CPPs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the active substance were identified. Based on this work, 
adequate in-process controls (IPCs) are applied during the synthesis. Impurities formed in step 1, from 
impurities in the starting materials, truncated peptides, or diastereomers all carry through to later stages 
since they are all attached to the resin and can’t be purged. By contrast, the removal of all reagents and their 
by-products can be assured by sufficient washing of the resin after each completed reaction. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. A thorough evaluation of impurities was carried out. Potential and actual 
impurities, including mutagenic impurities, were identified and strategies to prevent their formation or ensure 
their purge have been implemented. The active substance itself is AMES positive, although subsequent in 
vivo studies showed it is not mutagenic. Related impurities are considered to have equivalent toxicity by 
analogy. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents 
have been presented and are in line with the detailed knowledge of the process. The levels of impurities are 
controlled in the active substance specification. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced during development are minor, consisting of changes to solvents 
and reagents. A comparability exercise was carried out, demonstrating that the changes have no impact on 
CQAs of the active substance. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the 
development is therefore considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial 
process. 
The active substance is packaged in low density polyethylene bag closed with a cable tie inside a heat-sealed 
aluminium bag. The materials comply with the relevant requirements of the Ph. Eur. and EC Regulation 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (solid and in solution), identity (MS, HPLC, 
amino acid analysis), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), specific optical rotation (polarimetry), water content 
(KF), chloride content (titration), trifluoroacetic acid content (IC), residual solvents (GC), elemental 
impurities (ICP-MS), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 18 batches of the active substance throughout the whole development programme are 
provided. Manufacturing scales ranged from early lab scale batches, to pilot scale, culminating in 4 full 
production scale batches. The batches were used for toxicological, clinical, stability and validation studies. 
The results are within the specifications at the time of testing and consistent from batch to batch, taking into 
account the changes in manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 11/98 
  
  
Stability 
Stability data on 7 batches of active substance at >10% of the stated production scale from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package (although smaller scale) for up to 24 months (1 
batch for 36 months) under long term conditions (-20 ± 5 ºC) and for up to 24 months under accelerated 
conditions (5 ± 3°C) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Supportive data over 36 months on an 
additional pilot scale batch was provided. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities and water 
content. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. No trends to 
appearance, assay and impurities were noted. Water content increased over time but remained within 
specification. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. An increase in impurities 
with an associated reduction in assay was observed, along with an increase in water content. 
Forced degradation studies were conducted in the solid state and on the active substance in solution under 
thermal and humid conditions and in solution exposed to acid, base, oxidant and light. Etelcalcetide degrades 
to an extent under all conditions, to the greatest extent under warm humid conditions, but significantly so 
under all solution conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months at -20 ± 5 ºC in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Parsabiv is a sterile, single-use preservative-free solution for intravenous (IV) injection available in 3 
strengths containing 2.5, 5 or 10 mg of active substance respectively containing the following excipients:  
sodium chloride; succinic acid; water for injection; hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide. 
A liquid formulation was selected for development since it provides an easy to use dosage form, suitable for 
administration in the planned clinical setting. Excipients were chosen with stability and osmolarity of the 
formulation in mind. Succinic acid was selected as the optimum buffering agent. A range of tonicity agents 
were evaluated and sodium chloride was found to give the least amount of degradation at room temperature. 
The stability of etelcalcetide in solution is also dependent on its concentration. The amounts of the various 
excipients were then optimised and the robustness of the optimal formulation assessed by DoE, examining 
the impact of variation in concentration, pH and NaCl content on assay and osmolarity over time under both 
long term (2-8 oC) and accelerated (25 oC) conditions. At the lower temperature, the formulation is robust 
with respect to minor variations in composition. At the higher temperature, variation in pH had the largest 
impact on stability. Although multivariate experiments were carried out, no design space is claimed. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Phase 1-3 clinical trials were carried out using a lyophilised formulation which was reconstituted before 
injection with sterile water for injections (WFI). The lyophilised powder contains a different tonicity agent and 
once reconstituted, is less acidic. Concentration, stability and osmolarity are similar between the two 
Assessment report

Page 12/98 
  
  
formulations. Since both lyophilised and liquid formulations share the same IV route of administration, have 
comparable batch analyses and the active substance shows no sign of secondary or higher order aggregates, 
a bioequivalence study was not deemed necessary. The more practical liquid formulation was introduced into 
the phase 3 open label extension study and is intended for commercialisation. 
Etelcalcetide degrades significantly on heating and terminal sterilisation was therefore determined not to be 
appropriate. Following compounding, the formulated solution is sterile filtered and filled aseptically into glass 
vials. Some manufacturing parameters and the vial dimensions were modified on transfer of the process from 
one manufacturer to another during development without any impact on finished product quality. Batches 
from both manufacturers were used in clinical and stability studies. 
A holding study was carried out in order to assess the impact of prolonged contact between the formulated 
product and materials of the manufacturing vessels, piping and filters. No significant impact on product 
quality was observed: metal ion contact did not increase significantly and any organic leachables were below 
the levels of toxicological concern. Maximum processing times were defined for each step of the process. 
Given that the product is stored in a refrigerator, the applicant carried out fragmentation tests at low 
temperature to demonstrate that the rubber stopper can be pierced cold without compromising its integrity. 
Compatibility studies were carried out with siliconised polypropylene syringes and PVC tubing for dialysis to 
be used in the clinical setting. The results indicate no compatibility issues. 
The primary packaging is type I glass vials with fluoropolymer laminated elastomeric stoppers and aluminium 
seals with flip-off dust covers. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: dissolution and mixing of the excipients and active 
substance; sterile filtration; aseptic filling and capping. Formulation and sterile filtration were deemed critical 
steps  appropriate  limits  for  the  IPCs  have  been  set.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard 
manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  (formulation,  filtration  and  aseptic  filling)  have  been  validated 
using a bracketing approach. Two batches each (one at maximum vessel fill, one at minimum) of the 2.5 mg 
and 10 mg strengths were used. It was therefore deemed acceptable not to validate the 5 mg strength. Filter 
validation investigated membrane compatibility, extractables content and microbial retention with all results 
meeting  the  desired  criteria.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of 
producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  including 
appearance, identification (MS, HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), sub-visible particles (USP), pH (Ph. 
Eur.),  osmolarity  (Ph.  Eur.),  deliverable  volume  (Ph.  Eur.),  container  closure  integrity  (vacuum  decay), 
sterility (Ph. Eur.) and endotoxins (Ph. Eur.).

The specified impurities have been toxicologically qualified although tighter limits are set in the specification 
in line with batch data. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches of the 2.5 and 10 mg strengths 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. In addition, batch results were provided for five pilot scale batches of the 2.5 mg 
strength and ten of the 10 mg strength, as well as results from eleven batches of the lyophilised formulation. 
All batches complied with the specifications in place at the time of release. No batch results from the 5 mg 
strength were presented which is considered acceptable since it is an intermediate strength made using the 
same process. 
Stability of the product 
A bracketing approach to stability was adopted, with only vials of the highest and lowest strength used for 
the stability study. The design is considered acceptable as the 5 mg presentation is an intermediate strength 
made using the same manufacturing process. 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches each of the 2.5 and 10 mg strengths as well as two production 
scale batches of each strength stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (2-8 oC) and for up to 
6 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches  of  Parsabiv  are  representative  of  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary 
packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Results  from  an  additional  batch  of  each  strength  manufactured  at  a 
different site stored for up to 24 months under long term and accelerated conditions were also provided. Vials 
were stored either in an upright or inverted orientation. 
Samples  were tested  for  appearance,  assay,  impurities,  pH,  sub-visible particles,  container  closure  integrity 
and  sterility.  No  significant  changes  to  any  parameters  other  than  assay  and  impurities  were  observed.  An 
increase in impurities with an associated drop in assay occurred over time, relatively small under long term 
conditions  but  more  pronounced  at  higher  temperature,  although  results  remained  within  the  proposed 
specifications under both conditions. 
In  addition,  two  batches  were  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability  Testing  of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Parsabiv is photosensitive and degrades when the vials are exposed to 
light.  It  was  demonstrated  that  the  outer  carton  provides  adequate  protection  from  light.  An  additional 
photostability  study  was  carried  out  in  order  to  assess  the  impact  of  lighting  conditions  likely  to  be 
encountered  in  a  clinical  setting.  Results  indicate  that  Parsabiv  does  degrade  under  such  conditions  but 
statistical  analysis  supports  an  in-use  exposure  of  up  to  four  hours  outside  the  outer  carton  in  a  clinical 
setting. 
Stressed stability studies were also carried out under conditions of heat and exposure to acid, base, neutral 
pH  and  oxidant.  Degradation  was  observed  under  all  conditions,  more  so  under  basic  conditions  and  high 
temperature. 
A transportation study was also carried out with vials exposed to vibration, pressure and shock events at 2-8 
oC. Temperature cycling between -20 and 30 oC was also carried out. No impact on the measured parameters 
in either study was observed over the duration of the study.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months at 2-8 oC in the outer carton protected 
from  light  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  (section  6.3)  is  acceptable.  Once  removed  from  the  refrigerator,  Parsabiv 
should  not  be  exposed  to  temperatures  higher  than  25  oC  and  must  be  used  within  7  days  if  stored  in  the 
outer carton, or within 4 hours if removed from the outer carton. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Terminal sterilization is not feasible due to the instability of the active substance at high temperature which 
mandated the choice of sterile filtration. Since the process is considered non-standard, the process was 
validated prospectively using a bracketing approach. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Nonclinical pharmacology studies consisted of in vitro cell signalling studies to characterize the molecular 
pharmacology and target specificity of etelcalcetide on the CaSR. In vivo pharmacology studies utilized 
healthy dogs and rats and uremic rat models to characterize primary effects on PTH lowering and secondary 
effects on the complications of HPT.  
Primary pharmacology - In vitro 
Etelcalcetide is a calcimimetic that activates the CaSR signalling pathway both in HEK293T expressing CaSR 
and in isolated rat parathyroid gland.  Potency of etelcalcetide in ex vivo isolated parathyroid gland is 25-60x 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 15/98 
  
  
higher than potencies estimated by EC50 in an heterologous CaSR expression system.  CaSR was abundantly 
expressed in the chief cells of the parathyroid gland, to a lesser extent in kidney tubules adjacent to 
glomeruli and in pancreatic islets of Langerhans, glandular cells of the stomach and small intestine, and to 
the least extent in thyroid parafollicular cells.  Low expression in rat testis and rodent bone was only detected 
with the more sensitive methods. The similarity of CaSR expression across species supports the 
pharmacological relevance of the animal models.  
Etelcalcetide did not block or potentiate binding of the ligand to any of a panel of class III GPCR receptors. 
This supports specificity of binding of etelcalcetide to the CaSR when compared to a panel of receptors, ion 
channels and transporters. The requirement of the amino terminal D-cysteine in etelcalcetide, and the 
dependence on the interaction of the D-cysteine with the CaSR-cysteine on position 482 in the hinge region 
for agonist activity was established. None of the other members of the class III GPCR family that share this 
hinge segment have a cysteine in this region.  Together this suggests specific allosteric activity of 
etelcalcetide for CaSR. 
Primary pharmacology - In vivo 
In healthy dogs, etelcalcetide potentiates the calcium mediated activation of CaSR when administered at 
sufficiently high concentrations. In a 1K1C rat model of acute renal insufficiency rapid, reversible and dose 
dependent reductions in plasma PTH regardless of the degree of renal function or baseline PTH levels were 
observed upon etelcalcetide treatment. Consistent with a reduction in PTH, a dose-dependent reduction in 
serum calcium was also observed. 
In a rat model of chronic renal insufficiency (5/6 Nephrectomy) etelcalcetide treatment effectively reduced 
PTH, prevented soft tissue calcification (aorta and heart), kidney mineralization and parathyroid gland 
hyperplasia in these uremic rats. Treatment with etelcalcetide also has a positive impact on the expression of 
the CaSR, VDR and FGFR1 when dosed for six weeks, and may have a positive effect on gland function in the 
background of chronic kidney disease. In addition, etelcalcetide treatment appeared effective in decreasing 
PTH levels and PTG weight, reducing bone turnover and normalizing mineralization in a rat model of 
secondary HPT due to renal insufficiency.   
In 5/6 nephrectomy rats, that were fed a high phosphate (0.9%) and low calcium (0.6%) diet etelcalcetide 
decreased PTH levels, PTG weight, Ki67stained chief cells count and FGF23 levels. Cortical porosity, bone 
mineral density (femur diaphysis) bone strength endpoints such as maximal bone load, energy to failure and 
toughness trended power were all improved upon etelcalcetide treatment.  However, none of the measured 
factors improved to the level of the control rats.  
Etelcalcetide in uremic rats, in which uremia was induced by addition of 0.75% (w/w) adenine in a base diet, 
prevented development of increased PTG-weight, increased average Ki-67-stained parathyroid chief cell 
count and increase of the aortic calcium content. 
Secondary pharmacology 
An extensive discussion of literature, non-clinical and clinical data of etelcalcetide indicates that etelcalcetide 
is  likely  protective  of  bone  health  in  secondary  HPT  patients  due  to  normalization  of  high  bone  turnover  in 
these  patients.  Long  term  animal  studies  and  emergent  clinical  data  do  not  indicate  a  propensity  for 
Adynamic Bone Disease. Etelcalcetide carries no evident risk of carcinogenesis in various tissues. Nonclinical 
data  indicate  that  etelcalcetide  does  not  have  a  direct  effect  on  cardiac  morphology.  There  is  no  in  vivo 
evidence of immune related sequelae from CaSR activation. The risk of etelcalcetide impacting the occurrence 
of  Alzheimer  Disease  and  Pulmonary  Arterial  Hypertension  (PAH)  in  secondary  HPT  patients  is  considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 16/98 
  
  
negligible. Overall, non-clinical and clinical data fit well with the data present in published literature on CaSR 
and calcimimetics. 
Safety pharmacology 
There was no significant change in hERG current up to the highest concentration tested (10 μg/mL), which is 
at least 42-fold greater than the estimated human Cmax (unbound)  and 100 fold greater then clinical 
exposure at the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg. However, the originally submitted hERG channel test was 
regarded not - GLP compliant. With the responses the applicant has submitted a new hERG channel test, 
conducted under GLP compliance, from which results can be concluded that Parsabiv is not an inhibitor of the 
hERG channel.  
Upon a single IV dose of 1.5 mg/kg etelcalcetide the pharmacological effect that was observed was a 
decrease in plasma PTH associated with a decrease in serum calcium and magnesium and an increase in 
serum phosphorus. A slight QTc prolongation, increased body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure 
were detected. These changes are considered secondary to hypocalcaemia and/or stress associated with 
adverse hypocalcaemia. QTc prolongation in patients is further discussed in the clinical AR and is included in 
the RMP. 
Pharmacodynamic Drug Interactions 
The potential for additive or synergistic effects on CaSR signalling with co-administration of cinacalcet and 
etelcalcetide was evaluated in two HEK293T cell lines stably transfected with the human CaSR. Co- 
administration of cinacalcet and etelcalcetide turned to be additive with respect to CaSR activation. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of etelcalcetide has been investigated upon single dose intravenous (IV) 
administration in rat and dog. Multiple dose toxicokinetics (TK) was examined upon IV administration, which 
is the intended clinical route, in rat, dog and pregnant rabbit. Subcutaneous multiple dose toxicokinetics was 
examined in rat and mouse only. 
Methods of analysis 
A liquid chromatography (LC) method with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) was used for 
bioanalysis of etelcalcetide in plasma from the TK and PK studies. Validation reports for the analytical 
methods used, demonstrating the suitability of the methods for the purpose of analysis of etelcalcetide and 
its related products were provided. Metabolite profiling was performed by LC separation followed by 14C and 
high resolution mass spectrometric (HRMS) detection. Structure assignments of etelcalcetide 
biotransformation products were based on comparison to authentic standards, calculated elemental 
composition of the products based on HRMS data, the 12C and 14C isotopic peak pattern, prior knowledge of 
retention times, and interpretation of the collision induced dissociation fragmentation data. 
Absorption 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) studies were performed in as single dose in species, strains and formulation(s) used in 
the pharmacology and toxicology studies. The intended clinical route of etelcalcetide is by IV administration; 
therefore, the kinetics of absorption upon delivery by a non IV route was not studied. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 17/98 
  
  
The PK of etelcalcetide was studied following IV bolus administration to Sprague Dawley (SD) rats with 
normal renal function or varying degrees of renal insufficiency, and after IV bolus administration to beagle 
dogs with normal kidney function. Plasma exposure of etelcalcetide was dose proportional over the dose-
range tested. Etelcalcetide clearance was strongly dependent on renal function. Removal of both kidneys in 
rats (BN rats) resulted in a 3-fold reduction in etelcalcetide clearance  and in a 3-fold increase in exposure 
compared to rats with normal kidney function. The volume of distribution was 0.5 L/kg in normal rats and 0.7 
L/kg in BN rats, indicating good tissue penetration. Elimination was fast in rats with normal kidney function 
(~1.3 h) and moderate to slow (~6.7 h) in BN rats. In dogs, with normal kidney function, similar 
pharmacokinetics were found with a CL of 0.4 L/h/kg, a volume of distribution of 4 L/kg and a terminal 
elimination of 10 h. In humans similar pharmacokinetics was found upon IV administration to CKD patients, 
having a 5-fold higher exposure and 6-fold higher terminal elimination half life (3 – 5 d). 
The repeated dose PK profile of etelcalcetide was obtained from toxicokinetic studies only and determined in 
rat, rabbits and dogs following IV infusion and in rat and mouse upon SC administration. Subcutaneous 
administration was only studied in repeated dose TK studies. Overall, on multiple dosing, over the dose range 
examined, plasma concentrations and exposure generally increased in proportion to dose and there was no 
evidence of gender differences or appreciable accumulation (< 2-fold) with repeat IV or SC dosing for up to 6 
- 9 months in normal rats or dogs. As observed in single dose studies, after multiple dosing in rat or dog, by 
IV administration, a rapid initial decline in plasma levels from maximum concentration was observed followed 
by a slower elimination phase, indicating good distribution into the tissues. Subcutaneous pharmacokinetics 
showed a relatively fast absorption phase with peak concentrations occurring at the first time point measured 
(usually 15-30 min) after dosing in rats and mice. Thereafter, the PK profile followed a similar profile as 
observed upon IV dosing.  
Distribution 
The vivo tissue distribution of [14C]-etelcalcetide was determined in male and female SD rats and in male 
Long Evans (LE) rats by quantitative whole body autoradiography. No sex- or strain-dependent differences in 
tissue distribution of etelcalcetide-related radioactivity were observed. In general, for most tissues, the 
highest tissue concentration of radioactivity was found 1 h post-dose, declining thereafter with the exception 
of kidney and liver having a tissue Cmax at 12h post dose. The highest total tissue exposure over plasma 
exposure ratio was observed in the kidney (630x), liver (68x), cartilage (intervertebral (58x), hyaline (176x) 
and articular (26x)), epiphyseal plate (53x), spleen & bone marrow (61x), and lymph nodes (54x). Between 
2 to 84 days tissue levels declined slowly. The 14C-radioactivity half-life in tissues was generally longer than 
in plasma (140 h). Etelcalcetide-related radioactivity was even still present 84 days after dosing in bone 
marrow, cartilage, eye, kidney, lymph node, small intestine, spleen, thymus and thyroid. Longest 14C half life 
was found in the thyroid (>84 d), which may be related to its pharmacological target, the CaSR in the 
parathyroid. In the 6 month toxicity study a cytoplasmic eosinophilia was found in the parathyroid gland. This 
was considered reflective of increased chief cell activity related to etelcalcetide pharmacology. The lowest 
levels were detected in the brain and bone. When comparing SD and the pigmented Long Evans rats in the 
whole body autoradiography, the distribution profile was similar although a higher exposure and slower 
decline was found in the eye (~17 fold) as compared to the SD rat. In toxicology studies, however, no 
toxicological findings were reported for the (pigmented) eye in dog, suggesting that melanin binding 
apparently has no toxicological consequences. Of the tissues with moderate to high concentration of 
etelcalcetide-related radioactivity, cartilage (intervertebral, hyaline, and articular), and epiphyseal plate are 
of interest as literature suggests that the CaSR has a functional role in cartilage and bone regulating skeletal 
homeostasis.

The in vitro / in vivo protein binding studies of etelcalcetide in rat and human showed substantial protein 
binding, which was a combination of a reversible covalent binding (40%-70%) mainly to albumin, and of a 
non-covalent plasma protein binding in animals and humans of the resulting etelcalcetide.  
The covalent binding to form serum albumin peptide conjugate (SAPC) from etelcalcetide in human whole 
blood was fast reaching steady state by 3 hr. Non-covalent binding of etelcalcetide to plasma proteins was 
low to moderate, similar across species (fraction unbound range: 0.53 to 0.77) and was independent of 
concentration of albumin. This means that free etelcalcetide levels are about 1.2 and 1.5 fold higher in rat 
and dog, respectively, than in humans. It should be noted that etelcalcetide bioanalysis method uses protein 
precipitation, which means that the covalently albumin bound etelcalcetide (SAPC) is not included in the 
reported exposure levels.  
Blood to plasma (B/P) ratio of etelcalcetide in blood from rat, healthy humans, and humans with CKD was 
0.52, 0.53, and 0.66, respectively indicating no preferential partitioning of etelcalcetide into red blood cells 
but retaining in the plasma compartment. 
Placental transfer studies of etelcalcetide were investigated in rats upon IV administration. The observed 
mean percent of fetal plasma to maternal plasma concentration at 1-2h after dosing was 3 % on GD 21, 
indicating low placental transfer of etelcalcetide. In the rat fetal development study no toxicological effects 
were found upon etelcalcetide dosing. 
Transfer of etelcalcetide to the milk was investigated in rats upon IV administration. [14C]-etelcalcetide-
derived radioactivity was excreted in milk at concentrations similar to those in plasma. Cmax in milk was 
reached at 8 h after administration, at which time the milk/plasma ratio was 3.3 fold. 
Metabolism 
In vitro metabolism of [14C]-etelcalcetide, which was studied in hepatocytes, liver and kidney metabolizing 
fractions and rat and human whole blood, appeared relatively fast. Etelcalcetide was predominantly 
biotransformed via replacement of the L-cysteine moiety of etelcalcetide, whereas the D-amino acid 
backbone of the molecule remained intact. A similar metabolizing profile was found in rat and human whole 
blood. Overall, the evidence demonstrated that the biotransformation of etelcalcetide was predominantly the 
result of disulfide exchange rather than via metabolism by conventional metabolizing enzymes such as 
proteases or cytochromes P450.  
The in vivo biotransformation of etelcalcetide was only assessed following IV dosing in bile duct cannulated 
(BDC) rats with intact kidney function and in bilaterally nephrectomised  rats. A substantial proportion of the 
plasma radioactivity was covalently bound to plasma proteins via a disulfide link to the D-amino acid peptide 
portion of etelcalcetide, mostly as serum albumin peptide conjugate (SAPC, 42% of plasma AUC in normal 
rats and 19% in BN rats as compared to 59% and 71% in whole blood of rat and human). Biotransformation, 
as shown in vitro, was predominantly via replacement of the L-cysteine moiety; the D-amino acid backbone 
of the molecule remained intact. The most abundant non-protein adducted circulating components in rats 
with intact kidney function included [14C]-etelcalcetide (21.4-44.1%), M10 (22.3-28.0%) and M1 (2.6-6.7%). 
The plasma metabolic profile was slightly different in bilaterally nephrectomised male rats wherein the 
proportion of M1 (22.5%) was slightly higher. These metabolites were also observed in human plasma. 
Urine of rats with normal kidney function contained mainly intact drug (37%-47%) or the biotransformed 
products M1, M3, M2b. Overall renal elimination was minimal in bilaterally nephrectomised rats and therefore 
not studied. Excretion into faeces and bile was minor, and therefore these matrices were also not profiled for 
metabolite presence. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016

The kinetics of etelcalcetide and SAPC was characterized in vitro in healthy human whole blood. The 
metabolism of etelcalcetide by disulfide exchange with endogenous thiols in blood (e.g., L-glutathione) was 
relatively fast leaving 50% of intact etelcalcetide after 1h and yielding equilibrium after 3-4 h. SAPC was the 
predominant product formed, composing approximately 60% of all etelcalcetide related products, when 
etelcalcetide was incubated in whole blood. The disulfide exchange was reversible. The reverse reaction 
wherein etelcalcetide was formed from SAPC was 18-fold slower. Similarly, the disulfide exchanges that 
resulted in the formation of the aggregate of all non-protein biotransformed products from etelcalcetide were 
2-fold faster than the reverse reactions.  
Excretion 
The excretion of etelcalcetide was determined following a single IV administration of [14C]-etelcalcetide in bile 
cannulated rats with normal and no kidney function. The results showed renal elimination was the 
predominant in vivo clearance pathway for etelcalcetide in rats with normal kidney function (80%). The [14C]-
etelcalcetide was not eliminated by non-renal pathways in the nephrectomised  rats. There was minor 
excretion in faeces (< 4%) and bile (< 1%). Excretion in other preclinical species, such as dog, was not 
assessed. 
The dialysis properties of [14C] etelcalcetide-derived radioactivity were determined in an in vitro study. Intact 
etelcalcetide was readily dialyzed by a clinical dialyzer, and etelcalcetide related components were readily 
removed by dialysis but was significantly attenuated when etelcalcetide was preincubated for 3 hr in bovine 
whole blood to form SAPC. These in vitro study results indicate administration of etelcalcetide during 
haemodialysis would result in a significant loss of non-protein bound etelcalcetide. 
These data are in line with data in humans, where the urine is the major route of elimination, while a lower 
percentage of radioactivity was recovered from faeces. In CKD patients in urine and faeces combined only 
7% of the dose was excreted, while dialysis contained 60%. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity  
Such studies were not conducted with etelcalcetide, consistent with ICH M3(R2).  
Repeated dose studies 
In rats, etelcalcetide was well-tolerated up to 1 mg/kg/day after up to six months exposure. Observed effects 
were similar over studies, including concordance of effect types and severity in the two six-month studies 
performed. A dose-dependent decrease of serum PTH and serum calcium was observed at all doses, from 5 
minutes after dosing. Eight to 24 hours after dosing these parameters were returned to baseline levels. At 
doses higher than 1 mg/kg/day, the level of hypocalcaemia was considered adverse and was accompanied by 
characteristic stress responses. These included body weight and food consumption decreases as well as 
clinical signs, such as tremors, convulsions, prostration, decreased activity, lethargy, dyspnoea and 
dehydration. In addition, thymus, spleen and adrenal gland weight were decreased, accompanied by 
lymphoid depletion in the thymus and a reduction in splenic red pulp. Also neutrophils were increased and 
white blood cells decreased. After recovery, no adverse findings were detected and serum PTH, calcium and 
phosphorus levels were returned to normal. The rat/human exposure ratio at the rat NOAEL was between 
0.22 and 0.82, therefore, there are no safety margins. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 20/98 
  
  
In dogs, etelcalcetide was well-tolerated in one month studies up to 0.3 mg/kg/day, in the combined 3 and 9 
month study up to 0.5 mg/kg/day and a NOAEL was not reached in the 6 month study (LOAEL 0.2 
mg/kg/day). Observed effects were comparable over studies, including concordance of effect types (e.g. 
decreased body weight, decreased food consumption, QTc prolongation, decreased activity, prostration, 
lethargy and salivation among others) and severity in the combined non-GLP 3 and 9 month study and the 
GLP six-month study. However, adverse effects were observed at a lower exposure in the 6 month study 
(body weight and QTc prolongation) compared to the combined 3 and 9 month study. The dog/human 
exposure ratio at the NOAEL was 0.5 for the 3 and 6 month study. At the LOAEL the dog/human exposure 
ratio was 1.0 for the 3 and 6 month study and 0.12 for the 6 month study. 
In mice, etelcalcetide was well-tolerated at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day in treatment up to a month. Serum 
calcium was decreased and serum phosphorus increased at all doses tested, but was only considered adverse 
at doses 1.5 mg/kg/day in males and at 3.0 mg/kg/day in females. This is agreed. At higher doses, mortality 
was observed (6 mg/kg) accompanied by clinical signs, which are related to hypocalcaemia and related 
stress, including tremors, ataxia and effects on activity (≥3 mg/kg/day in males and ≥6 mg/kg/day in 
females). Redness, haemorrhage, and inflammation at the injection site of females was observed at high 
dose. The NOAEL for the mouse was 1.5 mg/kg/day for males and 3 mg/kg/day for females, with 
etelcalcetide exposure 0.17-0.25 times the exposure to humans at the MRHD. 
Toxicokinetic profiles were comparable between sexes for rat, dog, mouse and rabbit. Overall, on multiple 
dosing, over the dose range examined, plasma concentrations and exposure generally increased in proportion 
to dose and there was no evidence of gender differences or appreciable accumulation (< 2-fold) with repeat 
IV or SC dosing for up to 6 - 9 months in normal rats or dogs. Due to overt hypocalcaemia related adverse 
effects in healthy animals, the exposure at the NOAEL in animals was consistently lower compared to human 
exposure at the MRHD.  
Genotoxicity 
Etelcalcetide was found positive in two Salmonella strains (TA100 and TA1535) in the bacterial mutagenicity 
assay and was found negative in the chromosomal aberration test in vitro and in vivo, negative in gene 
mutation tests (CHO and CHL cells) and negative in the Muta Mouse assay.  
A further thorough investigation of the positive results in the bacterial mutagenicity assay was performed. In 
following experiments it was excluded that positive results were induced by free amino acids or impurities. 
Additional mechanistic studies were performed to understand the mechanism behind the positive response in 
the bacterial mutagenicity assay. Structurally related peptides were tested and removal of the D-cysteine 
from the peptide backbone completely eliminated mutagenic activity. This observation suggests that a thiol 
(RSH) or thiolate anion (RS-) is important for mutagenic activity of etelcalcetide. Further investigation 
showed that biotransformation of etelcalcetide is limited to disulphide exchange with the D-cysteine,  that the 
peptide backbone is stable in S. typhimurium and that it is unlikely that free L-cysteine is mediating the 
mutagenic activity of etelcalcetide in TA1535. Furthermore, it was found that TA1535 is sensitive to known 
oxidative mutagens, which suggests that TA1535 may be susceptible to ROS-mediated mutagenesis. This 
was confirmed by co-administration of an oxidant with anti-oxidants and iron-chelators in strain 1535, which 
showed that TA1535 is sensitive to free radical-mediated mutation under certain oxidant conditions, and that 
etelcalcetide may be inducing mutations via ROS formation. Other thiol-containing peptides and amino acids 
have been shown to be mutagenic in the bacterial mutagenicity assay, including L-cysteine, glutathione 
(GSH), N-acetyl cysteine, and cysteinyl glycine.

Carcinogenicity 
In a six-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 mice and a two-year carcinogenicity study in rats, no 
etelcalcetide related (non)-neoplastic microscopic changes or increased tumour incidence was observed. Both 
species were treated subcutaneously due to the technical limitations of dosing mice and rats by the IV route 
daily for the study duration. 
Because of decreasing survival in high dose groups and vehicle controls, groups were terminated early. This 
is agreed, as it is in accordance with OECD guidance 416, the EMA Note for Guidance on Carcinogenic 
Potential (CPMP/SWP/2877/00) and termination plans approved by FDA’s Executive Carcinogenesis 
Assessment Committee (ECAC). 
An increased incidence of fibrosis (rat) and inflammation and haemorrhage (mice) at the injection site was 
observed in vehicle control and etelcalcetide injected animals, but was not observed in the saline control 
group. These effects are considered vehicle related. 
Exposure at the high dose in both rat and mice studies was relatively low, with an animal/human exposure 
ratio of 0.4 for both rat and mice compared to human at the MRHD. This is due to the increased sensitivity of 
animals with normal renal function to the hypocalcaemic effects of PTH lowering. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Etelcalcetide did not induce malformations in offspring of rats and rabbits at exposure marginally above the 
intended human exposure (animal/human exposure ratios of 1.6 in rat and 4.3 in rabbit). Distribution studies 
showed limited placental transfer in the rat (2.9%), but exposure in the rat foetuses was observed (20 
ng/mg). 
In rats, etelcalcetide induced effects associated with hypocalcaemia at the high dose during gestation and 
lactation. There was a small delay in parturition and reduced pup weight at the mid and high dose, in addition 
to an increased incidence of dehydration in the pups and pup mortality at high dose. The effects of 
etelcalcetide on pre-weaning pup weights continued into the post-weaning period in the F1 generation males. 
The NOAEL for F0 and F1 was 0.75 mg/kg/day at end of rat gestation, this corresponded to a rat/human 
exposure ratio of 0.46. 
Studies in juvenile animals were not conducted as etelcalcetide is developed for the treatment of secondary 
HPT in adult patients (18 years of age and older) with CKD on haemodialysis. 
Local tolerance 
No haemolytic potential was observed for etelcalcetide in human blood cells and IV and para-venous injection 
of a single dose etelcalcetide 15 mg/injection was well-tolerated in Beagle dogs. 
Other toxicity studies 
There is no evidence that etelcalcetide is immunogenic in animals. 
Dependence is not expected based on lack of chemical or pharmacological similarity with other drugs, very 
limited CNS distribution, lack of behavioural observations in safety pharmacology and repeat dose studies, 
and no off-target binding to receptors linked with abuse potential. 
In accordance with regulatory guidance ICH M3(R2), studies on metabolites were not conducted.

The impurity isopropyl hydrogen sulphate was evaluated for mutagenicity in a bacterial reverse mutation 
assay and was not found mutagenic. One month repeated dose studies in rat and dog showed that impurities 
do not present an additional risk compared to etelcalcetide. 
Studies or information on phototoxicity of etelcalcetide or its metabolites/degradation products are not 
necessary according the note for guidance of photo-safety testing (EMA/CHMP/SWP/336670/2010) as the 
MEC for etelcalcetide < 1000 L mol-1 cm-1. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Because the compound is a synthetic peptide, no further ERA is necessary. Therefore etelcalcetide is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment.   
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
In vitro primary pharmacology studies sufficiently show specificity of etelcalcetide for interaction with CaSR 
evoking an allosteric stimulation in absence, but more efficiently in the presence of low levels of calcium, 
both in in vitro and ex vivo test systems.  
In vivo primary pharmacology of etelcalcetide has been sufficiently studied. Several models of secondary HPT 
were generated in rats by feeding a special diet and / or removing (parts of) the kidney(s).  Treatment with 
etelcalcetide restored PTH and subsequent calcium levels, prevented PTG hyperplasia, high bone turnover, 
mineralization of aorta, heart and kidneys and a decrease in bone strength. Also FGF23 levels and VDR, CaSR 
and FGFR1 expression were restored. Dependent on the model the above mentioned parameters restored 
near to normal or completely to normal levels.  
Secondary pharmacology has been extensively discussed and is regarded sufficient.  The specificity of the 
peptide for its target and the absence of any toxicity signals, other than caused by exaggerated 
pharmacology, that point towards off target effects of the peptide, does not warrant studies addressing 
secondary pharmacology.  
Safety pharmacology studies included an in vitro hERG channel test and one in vivo test in beagle dog to 
address potential effects of the compound on CNS, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. From the results 
of the newly submitted hERG channel test, conducted under GLP compliance, it can be concluded that 
Parsabiv is not an inhibitor of the hERG channel. The applicant attributed the QTc prolongation that was 
observed to decreased calcium levels, which is related to the primary pharmacology of etelcalcetide in 
healthy animals. As reflected in the RMP, cardiovascular function of patients treated with etelcalcetide will be 
monitored.  
One pharmacodynamic drug interaction study was conducted with etelcalcetide and cinacalcet showing that 
activities of both calcimimetics on CaSR were simply additive.  
In summary, the package of studies investigating the pharmacology of etelcalcetide was sufficient. 
Toxicology 
Stress responses are identifiable for many routinely evaluated clinical and anatomic pathology parameters 
(Everds et al. 2013). Etelcalcetide induced effects on organ weights (decreased thymus and spleen weight 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 23/98 
  
  
and increased adrenal gland weight) and concurrent pathological changes (lymphoid depletion in thymus, 
altered leukocyte counts and stomach erosion) are secondary effects due to stress. In addition, 
haematological and histopathological findings of stress only occurred at doses where evidence of stress and 
hypocalcaemia was observed. These stress related effects are described thoroughly in ICH S8 annex 1.4 
Interpretation of Stress Related changes and in the article of Everds et al (2013).  Therefore, these adverse 
effects can be related to stress and thus are probably not relevant for the human situation. 
Intra-cytoplasmic golden-brown pigment in the proximal tubules were observed in rat in the 6-month study 
at high dose only and in dogs in all dose groups of the 3, 6 and 9 month studies. After recovery this was fully 
reversible in rats, but in dogs the pigment was present with reduced severity at high dose, suggesting 
ongoing reversibility. The identity of the pigment and mechanism of increase is uncertain. Possible 
explanations are an increase in etelcalcetide or serum albumin peptide conjugates due to efficient tubular 
reabsorption of peptides or albumin. Alternatively it may reflect an increase in lipofuscin, a common 
background finding in the kidney of dogs, however this is less likely, as this effect was also observed in rat. 
The finding is considered non-adverse as no associated degenerative microscopic changes in the kidney were 
observed. 
Etelcalcetide induced a slight increase in QTc interval in both male and female dogs at most doses. QTc 
changes were anticipated due to decrease in serum calcium (Scheidegger and Drop, 1979). In dog safety 
pharmacology studies, it was additionally shown that QTc interval increase was directly associated with 
decreased serum calcium levels and not with a decrease in PTH. QTc changes have also been observed in 
patients and therefore monitoring of QTc has been included in the RMP. 
It is acknowledged that healthy animals are more sensitive to the hypocalcaemic effects of etelcalcetide 
compared to disease model animals with a decreased kidney function. Etelcalcetide induced pharmacological 
effects (decreased PTH and serum calcium and increased phosphorus) were observed at relatively low 
exposure, without any adverse signs, in healthy animals compared to human exposure in patients. Because 
of the wide bio-distribution of etelcalcetide (see PK section) with higher levels of etelcalcetide exposure in 
most tissues compared to serum levels, it can be reasoned that AUC is not a representative measure of 
exposure. On the other hand, it can be argued that bio-distribution in animal and human will be comparable, 
in which case etelcalcetide serum levels are a valid means to compare animal to human exposure.  
Taking this into account, due to the increased sensitivity of healthy animals to the hypocalcaemic effects, 
only exaggerated pharmacological effects related to hypocalcaemia or secondary stress are observed at 
exposure levels comparable to clinical levels in human (rat/human exposure margin of 2.0 at doses inducing 
hypocalcaemia). These exaggerated pharmacology effects are not relevant for the clinical situation, as in the 
clinical situation the dose will be adjusted based on levels of calcium in the blood. Theoretically, the 
hypocalcaemia induced adverse effects may dominate possible other adverse effects, which may be observed 
at higher exposure levels in animals with a decreased kidney function and in the clinical situation. Therefore, 
the performed studies are not able to capture possible adverse effects occurring at exposure levels relevant 
to human. So a large battery of toxicology tests involving many test animals has been performed with only 
very limited relevance for the clinical situation and thus could only be considered as supportive. Alternative 
studies might have provided a better understanding of possible adverse effects by etelcalcetide in the clinical 
situation.  Although more information on the lack or presence of adverse effects at an exposure equal to the 
human situation would have been preferred, the current repeated-dose toxicology package shows a 
pharmacological effect already at relatively low exposure compared to pharmacology induced adverse effects 
and, in addition, shows similarity to pharmacology induced adverse effects (hypocalcaemia related) observed 
in human. Additionally, although less in-depth examined than species in the repeat-dose studies, in the rabbit 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 24/98 
  
  
embryo-foetal toxicity studies no signs of toxicity were seen at more relevant higher exposures. Therefore, 
the toxicology package is deemed sufficient. 
The investigation of genotoxicity was performed adequately. 
In the two-year rat study, the Peto trend test for survival was statistically significant for female pituitary 
gland adenomas of the pars distalis linked to survival compared to saline and vehicle control. This was due to 
an outlier pituitary mortality ratio during week 89. The number of pituitary gland adenomas in male and 
female rats were not statistically increased compared to controls, and the incidence of pituitary gland 
adenomas in females was not dose/exposure dependent, and was similar to historical control. Besides, 
pituitary tumours generally alter the normal pituitary organ axis and induce secondary changes in pituitary 
axis target tissues, such as mammary tumours, which was not observed in this study. Furthermore, limited 
distribution of etelcalcetide in the central nervous system was observed. Therefore, the statistically significant 
Peto trend test for pituitary gland adenomas in females was considered neither biologically significant nor 
etelcalcetide-related.  
Regarding immunotoxicity, based on repeat-dose toxicity studies, there is no evidence of primary 
etelcalcetide induced immunotoxicity in animals. Although decreases in numbers of immune cells and thymus 
and spleen weight have been observed in rat and dog repeated dose studies, and also a high concentration of 
etelcalcetide is observed in lymph nodes (see nonclinical pharmacokinetics section), there is a vast amount of 
evidence indicating these findings are in agreement with adverse effects associated with stress, as described 
in ICH S8 Annex 1.4 and by Everds et al. 2013. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Marketing authorization for Parsabiv (etelcalcetide) may be granted from a non-clinical point of view related 
to pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology, as no major objections have been identified.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects

•  overview of clinical studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 25/98 
  
  
 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two studies in healthy volunteers and three studies in CKD patients were submitted to support the 
pharmacokinetics of etelcalcetide. Furthermore, three phase II studies (studies 20120330, 20120331, and 
20120334) and three phase III studies (studies 20120229, 20120230, and 20120231) in patients with 
chronic kidney disease receiving haemodialysis, with limited and sparse sampling data were submitted to be 
included in popPK and PK/PD modelling. In addition, 10 reports covering in vitro data and 1 report with 
population pharmacokinetic analysis were submitted. 
Analytical methods 
The LC-MS/MS methods applied were sufficiently validated. Validation proved that the methods were specific, 
precise and accurate. Stability was shown covering study sample handling and storage. During method 
development, plasma was acidified, as in non-acidified plasma, etelcalcetide was more sensitive to stability 
problems. Based upon the analytical reports, run performance was within normal criteria and ISR data 
showed acceptable reproducibility. 
Bioequivalence 
Etelcalcetide is administered as a solution for injection. Two formulations were used in the clinical studies, i.e. 
a lyophilized powder for reconstitution for injection and a sterile liquid for injection. Considering that both 
formulations are solutions for injection and taking into account the excipients, no influence on 
bioavailability/pharmacokinetics is expected.  
Linear pharmacokinetics in AUC is observed in healthy subjects and patients on haemodialysis with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism. At steady state, in CKD patients, the etelcalcetide accumulation ratio was about 2- to 
3-fold. Steady state was observed at about 4 weeks. The SmPC recommends to titrate the dose no more 
frequently than every 4 weeks, which would be in line with reaching expected steady state levels.  
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 26/98 
  
  
 
Etelcalcetide pharmacokinetics shows a moderate between-subject variability of about 50%. PopPK analysis 
indicated that the inter- and intra-individual variability in etelcalcetide distribution and elimination were 
relatively moderate to high (22 - 88%). Intra-subject variability was not evaluated.   
Distribution 
Etelcalcetide is not actively distributed into red blood cells. Etelcalcetide binds moderately to plasma proteins 
(about 55%) and binding was concentration independent. Plasma binding in plasma from healthy volunteers 
and CKD patients was comparable.  Drug-drug interactions due to protein displacement are not expected with 
etelcalcetide.  
Based upon animal data, etelcalcetide may transfer over the placenta and may be excreted into milk.  
The Vd in patients after single i.v. dosing was about 200 - 300 l. PopPK analysis indicate that in a typical 
patient, the steady-state volume of distribution was approximately 795.9 l, largely exceeding total body 
water. The mean Vss estimated in healthy subjects was also large (143.7 l). This may be attributed to the 
fast yet dynamic conjugation of etelcalcetide with albumin and possibly other plasma proteins. Given that this 
is a slow but dynamic process, conjugates (mainly albumin-conjugates) can be viewed as a reservoir for 
etelcalcetide, thus contributing to the moderately high estimate of volume of distribution. 
Metabolism 
In vitro data show that biotransformation of etelcalcetide appears to be the result of redox and/or chemical 
conversions rather than via metabolism by conventional metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 
enzymes. 
The inactive biotransformation products consist of mixed disulphides that arise from a reversible disulphide 
exchange of the L-cysteine moiety of etelcalcetide with other etelcalcetide molecules or endogenous thiols. 
The major product was a high molecular weight serum albumin adduct (SAPC). Other biotransformation 
products, formed upon disulphide exchange with low molecular weight thiols in blood such as glutathione and 
cystein-glycine, were also observed. 
Haemodialysis was the predominant elimination pathway (approximately 60% of the estimated administered 
dose). The dialysate 14C elimination rate half-life (mean, 40.2 days) was similar to the plasma terminal 14C 
half-life (mean, 35.9 days). In patients on haemodialysis, minor amounts of the dose were excreted in urine 
(estimated mean, 3.2% of administered dose) and in faeces (estimated mean, 4.5% of administered dose).   
After dialysis, etelcalcetide plasma levels partly rebounded, due to back conversion of etelcalcetide from the 
human serum albumin peptide conjugate (SAPC).  
In healthy Japanese subjects, the amount excreted in urine over 48 h was 28.4% at the 5 mg dose level, 
which is in line with the fact that the major part of etelcalcetide is in the form of the human serum albumin 
peptide conjugate, which cannot be excreted in urine. 
Elimination 
The plasma elimination half-life and clearance of etelcalcetide after single dose in healthy volunteers is about 
18 – 20 h and 5.4 – 8.1 l/h, respectively, and in patients on haemodialysis with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism about 128 – 183 h and 1.2 – 1.9 h, respectively. 
The PK differs greatly between healthy subjects and patients receiving haemodialysis, because etelcalcetide is 
cleared by normal renal function, while the predominant clearance pathway for patients is haemodialysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 27/98 
  
  
The presence of binding anti-etelcalcetide antibodies had no apparent impact on plasma etelcalcetide 
concentrations. 
A starting dose of 5 mg etelcalcetide is selected as at this dose, reductions in PTH in the patient population 
was observed. A dosing frequency of t.i.w. at the end of haemodialysis sessions was selected because 
haemodialysis effectively removes plasma etelcalcetide in patients. As mentioned before, plasma etelcalcetide 
concentrations are essentially at steady state after t.i.w. dosing for 4 weeks which supports the every 4 week 
dose titration schedule in the phase 3 studies. 
Special patient groups 
Based upon pre-dose concentrations and population pharmacokinetic analysis a small, but clinically non 
significant effect of gender and body weight was observed. Furthermore no effect of age and race was 
observed on the pharmacokinetics of etelcalcetide. 
The etelcalcetide pharmacokinetics differs greatly between healthy subjects and patients receiving 
haemodialysis because etelcalcetide is cleared by normal renal function, while the predominant clearance 
pathway for patients is haemodialysis. However, the indicated patient group is CKD patients on dialysis, 
meaning that the recommended dose is based upon the data from this patient group.   
No studies have been carried out in subjects with impaired hepatic function. Based on the metabolism and 
excretion pathways, it is not expected that a decreased hepatic function would affect the pharmacokinetics of 
etelcalcetide. 
Interactions 
In vitro data indicated that etelcalcetide is not metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro data 
showed that etelcalcetide is not a substrate, inducer or inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. In addition, etelcalcetide is not a substrate or inhibitor of 
Pgp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, PEPT1, or PEPT2. In addition, etelcalcetide did not 
inhibit BSEP. The renal transporters MATE1 and MATE2-K were not evaluated which is agreed considering the 
patients group where kidney function is largely absent.   
No in vivo interaction studies are carried out. Based upon the available in vitro data, no interactions are 
expected on CYP and transporters level. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Secondary HPT is a disorder characterized by parathyroid gland hyperplasia and increased concentrations of 
circulating PTH.  The disease is seen most commonly as a consequence of CKD.  The principal regulator of 
PTH secretion is the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) in parathyroid tissue.  Calcimimetics target the CaSR in 
parathyroid tissue (Brown and Hebert, 1996; Brown et al, 1993), and provide a means of regulating PTH. 
Etelcalcetide is an allosteric activator of the CaSR, binding directly to the extracellular domain and activating 
the receptor at a site which is distinct from the calcium activating site.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Four studies were primarily clinical pharmacology studies: one single dose study in healthy volunteers, one 
single dose study in non-Japanese patients, and two other studies performed in healthy Japanese subjects 
and in Japanese patients with secondary HPT receiving haemodialysis. The latter two are not considered 
sufficiently relevant for the current application and are therefore not separately discussed. 
The healthy volunteers single dose study (20130107 (KAI-4169-001)) included 4 cohorts: 0.5, 2, 5 and 
10 mg etelcalcetide administered by i.v. bolus injection.  Each cohort included 8 subjects (randomized 6:2 to 
etelcalcetide or placebo).  A total of 32 healthy men were enrolled and dosed.   
After a single i.v. dose of etelcalcetide, PTH nadir was seen after about 30 minutes. The maximum serum PTH 
reduction from baseline in the placebo, 0.5, 2, 5, and 10 mg dose groups was 3.5%, 21.7%, 55.4%, 69.0%, 
and 72.6%, respectively.  The mean percent change from baseline in serum PTH over time is shown in figure 
1 below.  The maximum PTH suppression was transient and serum PTH levels gradually returned to baseline 
within 10 to 24 hours in healthy volunteers. The second dip in PTH levels in the healthy volunteers between 
24-30 hours seen in placebo and treated subjects is likely due to the known circadian rhythm of serum PTH. 
Figure 1 Mean (± SEM) Percent Change From Baseline in Serum PTH Over Time in Healthy 
Volunteers 
Serum calcium concentrations decreased slowly after dose administration and reached the maximum 
decrease at 15 to 18 hours postdose in healthy volunteers.  Mean serum calcium over time is shown in the 
figure below.  Reduction of calcium is an expected consequence of PTH lowering.  Serum calcium 
concentrations in the 2 mg i.v. dose group returned to baseline by approximately 24 hours whereas those of 
the 5- and 10 mg i.v. dose groups returned to baseline within approximately 48 hours in healthy volunteers.

Figure 2 Mean (± SEM) Serum Calcium Over Time 
In the single dose patient study (20130139) a 2-period crossover design was used for cohorts 1 to 3 (i.v. 
doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg) with a 7 to 14 day period between etelcalcetide or placebo administration.  Four 
subjects were enrolled in each cohort and were randomized 1:1 to etelcalcetide or placebo.  The protocol was 
subsequently amended to remove the crossover design for cohorts 4 and 5, and 8 subjects were enrolled in 
cohorts 4 and 5 with 1:1 randomization. A total of 28 subjects (20 men and 8 women) were enrolled and 
dosed. 
Parathyroid hormone decreased maximally by approximately 30 minutes and in a dose-dependent manner 
after single doses of etelcalcetide in CKD patients receiving haemodialysis. The duration of maximal PTH 
reduction and time to return to baseline appeared to be dose-related. At 65 hours postdose, serum PTH was 
suppressed -48.5%,-49.3%, and -62.6%, in the 20, 40, and 60 mg dose groups, respectively (see figure 3 
below). 
Serum calcium concentrations decreased to reach maximum suppression between 8 and 24 hours after 
etelcalcetide i.v. doses of 5 to 60 mg and remained suppressed over the 65 hours evaluated.  The magnitude 
of serum calcium reduction from baseline ranged from 12% to 14% and appeared comparable for the 10, 20, 
40, and 60 mg i.v. dose groups.  Overall, the magnitude of serum calcium reduction in the 5 mg group was 
less apparent compared to other dose groups.  No changes in mean serum calcium were observed in the 
placebo group (Figure below).

Population model 
Data from one phase 1 and two phase 2 studies were used for the population model development (index 
dataset).  In the absence of etelcalcetide, time courses of calcium and PTH were described using indirect 
response models.  Selected covariates were tested as potential predictors of variability in model parameters.  
The covariates considered included age, body weight, sex, race, time on dialysis, baseline phosphorus and 
vitamin D.  The influence of these covariates on the PD parameters was tested.  Baseline PTH and calcium 
were not tested as covariates because PTH and calcium are part of the model structure.  Any potential effect 
of baseline PTH and calcium on PD parameters would have been captured during model fit.  A step-wise 
covariate analysis was carried out using univariate forward selection (p < 0.05) followed by backward 
elimination (p < 0.01). 
The interaction between etelcalcetide, PTH and calcium was adequately described by a semi-mechanistic 
PK/PD model which incorporated the role of PTH in calcium regulation, the feedback loop of calcium on PTH 
production via the CaSR, and the activity of etelcalcetide plasma levels in increasing the sensitivity of the 
CaSR to calcium. After only a short delay, the administration of etelcalcetide is predicted to rapidly decrease 
PTH levels, followed by a slower decrease in calcium. No significant covariates were identified as predictors of 
PD variability. The PTH and calcium changes at the end of week 3 (day 21) and week 4 (day 28) are 
comparable; so sampling at week 3 and titrating at week 4 is appropriate. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical program is considered appropriate for the objectives that are considered, to characterize the 
initial safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and exposure-response properties of etelcalcetide in healthy volunteers and 
CKD patients with secondary HPT receiving haemodialysis. From a pharmacological perspective, the two 
single dose studies, one in healthy volunteers, and one in patients are considered of most relevance. The 
studies in Japanese patients are of less relevance for the EU setting and are therefore not further discussed. 
Both studies demonstrated a dose dependent effect in PTH reduction for single dose treatment of 
etelcalcetide doses between 2.5 and 60 mg. Also a lagged effect on calcium reduction can be observed.   
A further model supports the proof of concept. A comparison between titration starting with 5 mg or fixed 
dosing of 10 mg indicates that titration with starting dose of 5 mg is a reasonable approach with comparable 
efficacy achieved in comparison to a fixed 10 mg dose but maybe less safety issues (lower chance of 
hypocalcaemia). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology has been sufficiently established.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
A multiple dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled patient study in 87 patients (study 
20120330) showed that treatment for up to 4 weeks with etelcalcetide 10 mg and 5 mg resulted in mean 
reductions from baseline in PTH during the efficacy assessment –period of 49.4% and 33.0%, respectively. 
The mean change from baseline in serum calcium (mean approximately 9.6 mg/dL) at endpoint was -13.0% 
in the 10 mg etelcalcetide dose group and -6.0% in the 5 mg etelcalcetide dose group. 
A single-arm, open-label, 12-week, dose-titration study (study 20120331) in 37 subjects with 
secondary HPT receiving haemodialysis (baseline PTH was 853.4 (644.25) pg/mL (mean (sd)) starting at a 5 
mg dose of etelcalcetide and titrated every 4 weeks based on the preceding serum iPTH (target an iPTH 
concentration ≥ 150 pg/mL and ≤ 300 pg/mL) and corrected Ca (cCa) levels to a maximum dose of 20 mg. 
The overall mean (95% CI) percent change in PTH concentration was -53.6% (-60.8%, -46.4%). Overall, 20 
subjects (56%) exhibited a mean iPTH value ≤ 300 pg/mL during the efficacy period. The overall mean (95% 
CI) percent change from baseline in serum calcium during the efficacy period was -15.1% (-17.0%, -13.1%). 
The mean dose level at the end of treatment was 11.1 mg in subjects overall, 8.8 mg in subjects with 
baseline iPTH ≤ 700 pg/mL, and 14.5 mg in subjects with baseline iPTH > 700 pg/mL. At week 5, 26 subjects 
(74.3%) were receiving 10 mg of etelcalcetide. At week 9, the majority of subjects were receiving 10 mg (9 
subjects [27.3%]), 15 mg (7 subjects [21.2%]), or 20 mg (8 subjects [24.2%])). At week 12, the majority of 
subjects were still receiving 10 mg (7 subjects [24.1%]), 15 mg (7 subjects [24.1%]), or 20 mg (5 subjects 
[17.2%]).

Design 
A Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study. Subjects were randomized to either AMG 416 or placebo in a 1:1 
ratio, stratified by mean screening PTH (< 600 pg/mL, between 600 and 
1000 pg/mL, or > 1000 pg/mL), recent cinacalcet use within 8 weeks prior 
to randomization (yes or no), and region (North America or non-North 
America). All subjects, regardless of treatment assignment, received 
standard of care with calcium supplements, active vitamin D sterols, and 
phosphate binders, as prescribed by the individual Investigator.

statistical significance only if the primary efficacy endpoint met the non-
inferiority criterion.  If this occurred, the three key secondary endpoints 
were to be tested for superiority sequentially at the 5% significance level.

The effects of etelcalcetide withdrawal on PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and cCa x P were evaluated in the 
treatment completer analysis set of the 6-month placebo-controlled combined dataset by the 30-day follow-
up. 
Randomization was stratified by mean screening PTH (< 600 pg/mL, ≥ 600 to ≤1000 pg/mL, and > 1000 
pg/mL), prior cinacalcet use (within 8 weeks before randomization), and region (North America or non-North 
America) in the placebo controlled studies and by PTH concentration (< 900 or ≥ 900 pg/mL) and region 
(North America or non-North America) in the active controlled study. 
Central laboratories were used to analyze chemistry, coagulation panel, haematology, pregnancy, PTH, 25-
hydroxyvitamin D, BSAP, CTX, and FGF-23 samples. Serum samples were analyzed for anti-etelcalcetide 
antibodies by Amgen. Where local laboratories were used, their participation in internal and external quality 
control, quality assurance, and accreditation schemes was evaluated by the study monitors. 
When serum albumin was < 4.0 g/dL, the calcium level was corrected according to the following formula; 
otherwise cCa was equal to total serum calcium: cCa (mg/dL) = total serum calcium (mg/dL) + (4 – albumin 
[g/dL]) x 0.8. Values for cCa x P were calculated as the product of cCa (mg/dL) and phosphorus (mg/dL); 
cCa and P were from the same sample. Analyses for PTH used the Advia Centaur assay method. This is a 
method to assay intact PTH. 
Eligible subjects were adults ≥ 18 years of age receiving haemodialysis (TIW) for ≥ 3 months. Subjects 
had stable dialysate calcium concentration (≥ 2.25 mEq/L in the placebo controlled studies and ≥ 2.5 mEq/L 
in the active controlled study) and had screening predialysis PTH of > 400 pg/mL in the placebo controlled 
studies and > 500 pg/mL in the active-controlled study, and cCa ≥ 8.3 mg/dL. Subjects who were receiving 
vitamin D sterols, phosphate binders, or calcium supplements must have been on stable doses. 
Subjects were excluded if they had received cinacalcet within 4 weeks of screening in the placebo 
controlled studies and within 3 months of screening in the active controlled study, or had a 
parathyroidectomy within 3 months of dosing or were anticipated to undergo a parathyroidectomy or kidney 
transplant during the treatment period. Subjects with a history of certain cardiovascular disease or cardiac 
abnormality or a history of seizure or who were receiving treatment for seizure disorder were excluded. 
The starting dose of etelcalcetide in these three phase 3 studies was 5 mg administered i.v. TIW at the end 
of the haemodialysis session.  The dose was increased at study weeks 5, 9, 13, and 17, according to the 
algorithm in the table below, to achieve predialysis serum PTH ≤ 300 pg/mL.  The maximum etelcalcetide 
dose allowed was 15 mg i.v. TIW.  In Study 20120360, the starting dose of cinacalcet was 30 mg once daily, 
and cinacalcet dose adjustments are summarized in the table below.

Study Participants  
The study population in the placebo controlled study 20120229 consisted of 57.3% men and 42.7% women 
with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 57.7 (14.6) years and a range of 21 to 93 years; 34.6% of 
subjects were ≥ 65 years old.  Most subjects were white (68.5%), followed by black (27.8%) and Asian 
(1.6%).   Baseline values for PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and cCa × P were similar between treatment groups.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
General 
Evaluation and confirmation of the effect by means of two placebo controlled trials and one study that 
compared etelcalcetide to cinacalcet is considered appropriate to have a sufficient understanding of the 
efficacy and safety of etelcalcetide in the indication that is claimed. In addition, additional long-term safety 
and efficacy data have been presented by two open-label extension studies. 
These were multicentre studies with recruitment in several countries across the globe which enables 
extrapolation of the data. Several countries in Europe have been included as well, important to be able to 
conclude on the results for the EU population.

The inclusion criteria are considered appropriate to represent a dialysis population with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). In the comparator study more stringent levels of initial PTH levels were defined 
than for the placebo-controlled trials as this study included an endpoint that evaluated a > 50% reduction in 
PTH. The argumentation is acceptable that a lower PTH eligibility criterion may have resulted in on-treatment 
PTH values that were below the lower limit of the target range. In addition, hypocalcaemia should have been 
absent.  
The exclusion criteria are acceptable. Patients should not have recently used cinacalcet, intended for a similar 
target population, or surgical interference in the target organ of parathyroid gland and kidney. From a safety 
perspective, exclusion of vulnerable patient groups (history of certain cardiac disorders in the past 6 months 
such as myocardial infarction, CHF III or IV, ventricular arrhythmia) is accepted. However, as a CKD patient 
population on haemodialysis is known to be at risk for cardiovascular comorbidity, the external validity of 
these studies may be somewhat compromised. 
Clear guidance was applied for concomitant therapy during screening for calcium supplementation, vitamin D 
sterols, and phosphate binders, while for nutritional vitamin D no restriction applied. This is considered 
needed and acceptable. During study, for the most important concomitant therapy options, phosphate 
binders and vitamin D sterols, strict rules were applied, which is considered acceptable and needed as these 
interfere with the main outcome of the study.  
The flexible treatment algorithm used in the phase 3 studies is in line with previous smaller studies and 
based on achievement of PTH levels and the intent not to compromise the cCa levels. This is considered 
appropriate. Such treatment algorithm warrants regular monitoring of PTH, cCa and phosphorus. For the 
comparator study a similar dosing algorithm was also applied to achieve predialysis serum PTH levels 
≤ 300 pg/mL with flexible adjustments based on too low levels of PTH, calcium or adverse events including 
suspension of treatment. This is considered appropriate. 
The primary and secondary objectives are largely based on evaluation of improved control of laboratory 
markers in secondary HPT. This is acceptable and reflects current clinical practice. The primary biochemical 
endpoint of proportion of subjects achieving a reduction of PTH levels from baseline by >30% can be 
considered a relevant and clinical meaningful endpoint as patients on dialyses suffer from extensive elevated 
levels of PTH. This endpoint has also been used as a secondary endpoint in the EU marketing authorisation 
application for cinacalcet. The proportion achieving lower levels than 300 pg/ml is an acceptable secondary 
endpoint and is of importance in considering the primary endpoint results as it provides more information on 
the absolute relevant reduction in PTH. This endpoint was used in the cinacalcet marketing authorisation 
application as a primary endpoint. Furthermore, monitoring of cCa reductions and cCa x P, and P alterations 
have been associated with calcimimetics and provide further understanding of the effect of etelcalcetide 
secondary to lowering of PTH. In addition, exploratory objectives investigating effects of etelcalcetide on 
(high turnover) bone markers are considered important with respect to evaluation of more clinically relevant 
outcomes. More relevant clinical outcomes such as fracture incidences or need for parathyroidectomy, and 
other symptoms and signs associated with secondary HPT are not investigated. Feasibility of such studies 
may be questioned due to the need of large clinical studies during a more extensive period of time. For 
instance, fracture incidence in dialysis patients has been estimated to be 7.45 per 1000 person years for 
males and 13.63 per 1000 person years for females based on USRDS data (Alem, KI, 2000). Also, any 
significant effect could also not be demonstrated in the “Evaluation of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower 
Cardiovascular Events” (EVOLVE) study with cinacalcet. 
The randomisation procedure is considered appropriate. Blinding procedures are also considered appropriate, 
as well as the applied visit schedules. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 56/98 
  
  
Measurements of laboratory values by central laboratories is considered important for blinding of 
measurements for patient and investigator, and for standardisation of methods used for quantification of 
measurements, consequently reducing variability. In particular, iPTH measurements are prone for variability. 
Although other methods exist, intact PTH measurements are currently (still) the most used method in clinical 
practice to measure PTH, and it is therefore acceptable. The method used for correction of serum calcium 
measurements for low levels of serum albumin can also be considered to reflect practical principles and is 
therefore acceptable. 
Specific comparator study considerations 
Non-inferiority investigation on the primary endpoint of proportion of patients with >30% reduction of PTH is 
accepted. Subsequent secondary superiority investigation is acceptable, as it suggested that etelcalcetide 
may have stronger and/or faster effects than cinacalcet possibly due to it’s binding properties to the calcium 
receptor. In this respect, the same approach was used for the evaluation of proportion of patients with > 
50% reduction of PTH, which is acceptable as well.  
The assessment of PTH has been performed at a single time point prior to dialysis and at least 12h post 
dosing of cinacalcet.  This is considered appropriate, as a model simulation the PTH levels over time 
demonstrated a similar effect as the single time point chosen.  
The third superiority secondary endpoint (safety endpoint) of mean number of days of vomiting or nausea 
per week in the first 8 weeks could be of relevance from a safety perspective depending on the magnitude. A 
Nausea/Vomiting Symptom Assessment was used as a patient outcome. Such a patient outcome 
questionnaire can be acceptable and is commonly used for such type of assessment although this specific 
questionnaire is not generally known (for instance, in oncology associated trials a Functional Living Index of 
Emesis (FLIE) is an accepted questionnaire; see also Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of 
medicinal products for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer therapy).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose justification 
Dose justification is based on a 4 week placebo controlled phase 2 study comparing multiple dosing effects on 
PTH (and calcium) levels for the 5 and 10 mg dose and a single open-label dose titration study. 
These studies provide some knowledge on the dose response after multiple dosing according to the dosing 
algorithm applied, showing that the 10 mg is more effective than the 5 mg dose during 4 weeks of titration. 
Also, the 10 mg is the most used dose, and 8 patients (24%) needed the highest 20 mg to achieve a long 
term reduction in PTH and serum calcium levels within the acceptance range. Comparisons of effect of the 5 
mg dose in the phase 3 studies and the open-label phase 2 study have been made, demonstrating 
comparable effect sizes after 3 weeks of treatment. These data are considered being reassuring in terms of 
consistency of effect, although only data for the short 3-4 weeks term have been presented. The 15 mg dose 
has been chosen as the maximum dose as the 20 mg dose displayed a higher need for dose interruptions due 
to AEs. 
Placebo controlled studies 
There were no major differences in the disposition between study drug and placebo and between both 
studies, although the discontinuation rate was high within the placebo group (approximately 21-24%). Yet, 
reassuring is that discontinuations in the treatment group were less than for placebo, and mainly attributable 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 57/98 
  
  
to less patients with rising PTH as a specified discontinuation rule. Proportion of patients who were lost to 
follow up were slightly larger in the etelcalcetide treatment groups, however, still limited to 30 patients in 
total for etelcalcetide. Randomisation was successful as no substantial differences could be noticed between 
treatment groups. Furthermore, both studies showed large similarity for the patients included with no major 
differences. This allows for presentation of integrated results of both studies. Included patients represent a 
dialyses population with increased levels of PTH (approximately around 800 pg/ml) and for whom around 
40% were treated already for more than 5 years with haemodialysis. Elderly patients were well represented 
with around 35% of patient older than 65 years, although only approximately 14% of patients older than 75 
years were included. Patients were equally distributed for the region stratification factor of North America vs 
non-North America. Patients extensively used other medication of interest with about 70% using vitamin D 
sterols, and around 83% using phosphate binders, and about 37% using calcium containing phosphate 
binders or calcium supplements.   
In both placebo controlled trials in patients with a mean PTH level at baseline of approximately 840 pg/mL, a 
clear significant difference in the proportion of patients reaching more than 30% reduction in PTH could be 
observed for the treatment with etelcalcetide versus placebo treatment at 26 weeks (380 subjects [74.7%] 
vs. 46 subjects [8.9%], respectively, p<0.001). This effect already started 2 weeks after start of therapy and 
was maintained throughout the treatment period. Also significantly more subjects reached PTH levels ≤ 300 
pg/mL while on etelcalcetide during this period (262 subjects [51.5%] vs 25 subjects [4.9%], respectively, 
p<0.001).  
The data indicate that after each titration step more patients reached the event of the >30% reduction in 
PTH. A considerable proportion of patients needed to be titrated to the highest 15 mg dose to reach this 
endpoint (18-23%). During the procedure the applicant provided further information on individual dose 
titrations in both placebo- and active controlled studies. Most patients (>80%) experienced only one period 
of temporary dose suspension while a low number of patients needed permanent discontinuation. Incidence 
of too low calcium levels and hypocalcaemia appeared to decrease with increasing duration as was seen for 
the number of dose suspensions. Overall, temporary suspensions (with or without dose reduction) appear 
manageable for etelcalcetide.  The need for regular PTH monitoring has been addressed in the SmPC, as well 
as the dose adaptations needed in response to PTH levels < 100 pg/ml and how re-initiation doses need to be 
determined.  
The data further showed a secondary significant reduction in cCa with etelcalcetide treatment in comparison 
to placebo (-7.0% vs 0.87%, respectively, with baseline levels around 9.65 mg/dL) with a maximum effect 
reached after 10 to 12 weeks of therapy after which the difference in cCa reduction slightly narrowed 
between treatment and placebo. Similarly, this could be observed for the cCa x P percentage change over 
time, and was also significantly different. Also, a relative reduction in phosphorus was demonstrated (-8.7% 
vs -1.5%, respectively, with baseline levels around 5.8 mg/dL). The largest effects were seen between week 
6 and 20, although variability was larger than for the other laboratory values.  
Numerical reductions could also be observed for exploratory endpoints of bone markers in bone specific 
alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and Type I collagen C-telopeptide (CTX) at weeks 12 and 27 in the etelcalcetide 
group relative to the placebo group, which may indicate a positive effect on bone turnover. Similarly for 
fibroblast growth factor-23, involved in regulation of phosphate concentration, a numerically decrease could 
be observed for both studies with etelcalcetide compared to placebo. 
After treatment withdrawal, calcium, cCa x P, and phosphorus nearly returned to baseline values which 
support the observed pharmacological effect and the need for continuous etelcalcetide treatment. However, 
PTH values remained at a 40% reduction compared to baseline. It could be argued that the withdrawal 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 58/98 
  
  
follow-up of 30 days might have been too short for several individuals due to several possible reasons, e.g. 
persistent drug effect of etelcalcetide, vitamin D sterol and calcium supplement use during the washout 
period, changes in calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) expression and increased sensitivity to serum calcium 
after etelcalcetide treatment, changes in bone remodelling during etelcalcetide treatment, and/or secondary 
hyperparathyroidism (HPT) disease heterogeneity.  
Subgroup analyses showed that a robust positive effect on the primary endpoint of > 30% reduction from 
baseline in PTH and on the secondary endpoint of proportion of subjects with PTH ≤ 300 pg/mL. No 
substantial differences for the stratification factors of baseline PTH category, and prior cinacalcet use were 
noticed. Although some differences appear for some subgroups, this may be due to chance finding or have 
been reasonably explained (e.g. subgroup of baseline vitamin D sterole use; more efficacy in patients without 
baseline vitamin D sterol use). 
Active controlled study 
There were no major differences in the disposition between etelcalcetide and cinacalcet. The percentage of 
patients who discontinued is acceptable with no major differences between both treatment arms. Almost all 
patients were given at least one dose of treatment. The number of patients who were lost to follow up were 
slightly larger in the etelcalcetide arm, however, still limited to 12 patients for etelcalcetide. Reassuring is the 
lower number of discontinuations due to adverse events. Treatment arms were properly balanced as no 
substantial differences can be noticed. Included patients represent a dialyses population with increased levels 
of PTH (approximately around 1100 pg/ml), which is slightly higher than the placebo controlled studies due 
to different inclusion criteria. In addition, around 43% of patients were treated already for more than 5 years 
with dialyses. Acceptable numbers of elderly patients were included with around 26% of patient older than 65 
years of age, although only approximately 8% of patients older than 75 years of age were included. Patients 
extensively used other medication of interest with about 60% using vitamin D sterols, and around 49% using 
phosphate binders, and about 50% using calcium containing phosphate binders or calcium supplements. 
Non-inferiority has been demonstrated with 77.9% of subjects in the etelcalcetide group versus 63.9% of 
subjects in the cinacalcet group meeting the endpoint of > 30% reduction from baseline in mean predialysis 
serum PTH: difference of -10.48% (-17.45%, -3.51%) with the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI being 
lower than the prespecified margin for noninferiority <12%.  
In addition, analyses were performed to identify whether etelcalcetide was superior to cinacalcet with regard 
to the reduction of mean predialysis serum PTH levels during the study. Results show that with the titration 
algorithm chosen in the study, the proportion of patients achieving > 30% reduction from baseline in mean 
predialysis serum PTH, as well as the proportion of patients achieving > 50% reduction, was higher with 
etelcalcetide than with cinacalcet when compared at the chosen efficacy assessment time period of weeks 20 
to 27 of the study.  PTH levels over time demonstrated a slightly higher reduction for etelcalcetide versus 
cinacalcet starting at approximately 12 weeks of treatment until 26 weeks of treatment, supporting above 
analyses. The data also indicate that after each titration step more patients on etelcalcetide reached the 
event of the > 30% reduction in PTH compared to cinacalcet. These results should be considered in the 
context of the relative faster titration scheme used for etelcalcetide (5 mg general starting dose up to 15 mg 
maximum dose with allowed incremental steps of 2.5-5 mg at 4-weekly intervals) compared to cinacalcet (30 
mg starting dose up to 180 maximum dose with allowed incremental steps of 30 mg or 60 mg [ie, from 120 
mg to 180 mg] at 4-weekly intervals).

Etelcalcetide was not superior to cinacalcet with regard to the number of days vomiting and nausea per week 
during observation of the first 8 weeks. Further, vomiting and nausea investigated separately supported this 
absence of superiority.  
Since the number of days vomiting and nausea per week during observation of the first 8 weeks did not 
reach the superiority level of pre-specified significance level of 0.05, and even showed a slightly numerical 
inferior effect, no conclusions based on statistics could be drawn for subsequent endpoints.  Nevertheless, 
treatment with etelcalcetide resulted in numerically lower levels of calcium over time, starting to show an 
immediate difference after start of treatment. Similar observations apply to the phosphorus concentration 
over time. 
Numerically greater reductions could be observed for bone markers of bone specific alkaline phosphatase 
(BSAP) and Type I collagen C-telopeptide (CTX) at week 27 in the etelcalcetide group in comparison to the 
cinacalcet group, although great variability is noticed. With the uncertainty noticed, this may indicate a 
positive effect on bone turnover. Similarly for fibroblast growth factor-23, involved in regulation of phosphate 
concentration, a numerical decrease could be observed. 
The slightly faster treatment algorithm for etelcalcetide could have led to slightly higher proportion of 
temporary dose interruptions with etelcalcetide (23%) compared to cinacalcet (19%). Also, a slightly higher 
proportion of patients were treated with dose increase of vitamin D sterols and/or calcium-containing 
phosphate binder or calcium supplement during these dose suspensions, though this did not substantially 
affect the PTH efficacy.  A slightly higher proportion of etelcalcetide patients needed downtitrations (6.3% vs 
1.2% for cinacalcet at week 5; 16.6% vs 11.4% at week 17 but, the treatment effect at every titration week 
was better for etelcalcetide than for cinacalcet, thus downtitration appear not to affect the better effect on 
PTH over time for etelcalcetide. Also slightly more patients had a PTH < 100 pg/ml when compared to 
cinacalcet. 
Long term effect 
Patients from the placebo controlled studies have been enrolled in an open-label phase 3 extension study ( 
384 patients received etelcalcetide during both parent and extension studies; at least 75 at week 84). 
Patients from the open-label phase 2 study titration study have been enrolled in an open-label extension 
phase 2 study (30 patients received etelcalcetide in both parent and extension studies; 7 at week 116). 
During the phase 2 extension study, the reduction in PTH and serum calcium was maintained, although slight 
increases in these levels could be observed. In particular, during extended treatment beyond 52 weeks this 
could be observed albeit patient numbers became more limited. The phase 3 extension study demonstrates 
that the PTH reduction can be maintained during 78 weeks of treatment, although a clear line between a 
titration and a maintenance phase in etelcalcetide treatment appears to be lacking. Dose adaptions have 
been necessary at various time points during prolonged treatment, driven by PD response. 
PTH levels increased again during the withdrawal phase although baseline levels were not reached. Similar 
results were observed for the other markers calcium and phosphorus, although the difference is that these 
returned to baseline levels. Furthermore, they did not decrease to a similar extent as observed during the 
placebo-controlled phase.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The phase 3 studies demonstrated that etelcalcetide significantly reduced PTH levels in comparison to 
existing background therapy. This was further supported by significant reductions in the secondary 
Assessment report

parameters cCa and phosphorus. Also, numerical reductions were seen in the exploratory endpoints for bone 
markers including bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), Type I collagen C-telopeptide (CTX), and FGF-
23. Reductions in PTH, cCa and phosphorus could be maintained during long term extension up till 78-112 
weeks of treatment. Etelcalcetide demonstrated larger reductions in PTH levels than cinacalcet with the 
titration algorithm and time points chosen in the study; frequency of nausea and vomiting were not 
significantly different between both treatments. The effect on PTH was supported by numerical reductions in 
cCa and phosphorus. Also, some numerical lowering of specific bone markers could be observed. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data from the 6-month placebo-controlled combined dataset which includes all data collected in the 
2 double-blind pivotal studies (20120229, 20120230) are presented. Separately, data from the 6-month 
active-controlled study (20120360) have been included. Further, long term safety data from the phase 3 
open-label extension phase have been included. Etelcalcetide  is also sometimes referred  to as AMG 416 
throughout the text. 
Patient exposure 
For the entire clinical development program 1704 subjects received at least 1 dose of etelcalcetide (Table 
2.9). A total of 499 subjects were exposed for at least 1 year. 
Table 2.9 Total subject exposure to etelcalcetide in clinical trialsa by duration – Safety Analysis 
Set. 
In phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies, a total of 1655 subjects received at least 1 dose of etelcalcetide, 
1199 (72.4%) received etelcalcetide for > 24 weeks, and 499 (30.2%) received etelcalcetide for > 52 weeks.  
The mean (SD) duration of exposure was 39.5 (24.5) weeks. The most frequent dose (ie, the dose level 
at which the subject spent the most time) was 5 mg for 40.0% of subjects (Table 2.10). The extent of 
exposure to etelcalcetide was in accordance with guidance from Health Authorities and International 
Conference on Harmonisation guidelines (ICH E1). No limitations of the safety database in relation to the 
proposed target population could be identified.

analysis set). 
Baseline demographics were generally well balanced between treatment groups. 
Concomitant medication use was mostly comparable between the study groups. However, a noticeable 
difference between study groups is observed for calcium supplements at baseline. The applicant explored the 
issue but could not identify sources to explain the numerical differences in the rates of calcium supplements 
at baseline. It is considered a chance finding. The imbalance is unlikely to substantially affect primary 
analyses and the impact on the benefit-risk balance is considered minor. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events were analysed and reported using integrated safety data from the etelcalcetide trials In the 6 
month placebo controlled pool, 461 subjects (91.7%) in the etelcalcetide group and 410 subjects (79.9%) in 
the placebo group had treatment emergent adverse events (Table 2.11).  
The subject incidence of serious adverse events (25.8% etelcalcetide; 29.0% placebo), adverse events 
leading to discontinuation (1.8% etelcalcetide; 2.5% placebo), and fatal adverse events (2.2% etelcalcetide; 
2.9% placebo) was not higher in the etelcalcetide group compared with the placebo group.  
In the active-controlled study, 92.9% of etelcalcetide subjects and 90.0% of cinacalcet subjects had 
treatment emergent adverse events.  
The subject incidence of serious adverse events (25.1% etelcalcetide; 27.3% cinacalcet), adverse events 
leading to discontinuation of investigational product (5.6% etelcalcetide; 4.7% cinacalcet), and fatal adverse 
events (2.7% etelcalcetide; 1.8% cinacalcet) was in general comparable between treatment groups.

The most common adverse event within the placebo-controlled studies was asymptomatic blood 
calcium decreased (63.8% etelcalcetide; 10.1% placebo) (Table 2.12). This includes asymptomatic 
reductions in calcium below 7.5 mg/dl or asymptomatic reductions in serum corrected calcium between 7.5 
and < 8.3 mg/dl that required medical management or that the investigator deemed clinically significant.  
Other common adverse events that occurred with a greater frequency in the etelcalcetide group 
compared to placebo (≥ 5% in the etelcalcetide group with ≥ 1% difference from placebo) were blood 
calcium decreased (63.8% etelcalcetide; 10.1% placebo), muscle spasms (11.5% etelcalcetide; 6.6% 
placebo), diarrhea (10.7% etelcalcetide; 8.6% placebo), nausea (10.7% etelcalcetide; 6.2% placebo), 
vomiting (8.9% etelcalcetide; 5.1% placebo), headache (7.6% etelcalcetide; 6.0% placebo), and 
hypocalcaemia (7.0% etelcalcetide; 0.2% placebo). Symptomatic reductions in serum corrected calcium 
< 8.3 mg/dL were reported as adverse events of “hypocalcaemia”, and the associated signs and symptoms 
were also captured. 
A similar pattern was observed for the active-controlled study and consistent with the placebo controlled 
studies. For the most frequently reported adverse events, asymptomatic blood calcium decreased 
(68.9% etelcalcetide; 59.8% cinacalcet) was higher, while nausea (18.3% etelcalcetide; 22.6% cinacalcet), 
vomiting (13.3% etelcalcetide; 13.8% cinacalcet), and diarrhoea (6.2% etelcalcetide; 10.3% cinacalcet) 
were numerically lower for etelcalcetide than for cinacalcet. Also hypocalcaemia (5.0% etelcalcetide; 2.3% 
cinacalcet) was higher.  
The Kaplan Meier estimate of median time to the first hypocalcaemia event was 9.6 weeks in the etelcalcetide 
arm in placebo-controlled studies and 9.7 weeks in the etelcalcetide arm in the active-controlled study.

Table 2.12 Subject incidence of treatment emergent adverse events occurring in ≥5% of subjects 
in any arm (6-month Placebo/Active-controlled dataset – Safety Analysis Set). 
Overall, 73.4% of subjects (300.1 per 100 subject-years) in the phase 3 long-term open-label extension 
combined dataset had at least 1 treatment emergent adverse event. The most common adverse event blood 
calcium decreased (31.0%; 60.9 per 100 subject-years), being highest in subjects who received placebo in 
the parent studies (55.9%; 120.2 per 100 subject-years), which was expected as these subjects had not 
previously received etelcalcetide. Other common adverse events by preferred term (≥ 7%) were diarrhea 
(7.8%; 11.6 per 100 subject-years), nausea (7.0%; 10.3 per 100 subject-years), and vomiting (7.0%; 10.3 
per 100 subject-years).  
For the 6 month placebo controlled pool, during the study, a higher percentage of subjects in the 
etelcalcetide group compared with the placebo group received vitamin D sterols (78.3% etelcalcetide; 
69.6% placebo) and calcium-containing phosphate binder or calcium supplement (70.4% 
etelcalcetide; 49.3% placebo).  Overall, 84.7% of subjects in the etelcalcetide group and 86.5% of subjects 
in the placebo group received phosphate binders during the study.  The majority of subjects in both groups 
had no change in dialysate calcium during the study (74.2% etelcalcetide; 95.7% placebo).  A higher 
proportion of etelcalcetide subjects had only increases in dialysate calcium from baseline during the study 
(24.9% etelcalcetide; 2.7% placebo). 
Adverse events of special interest 
In the 6-month placebo/active controlled pool, most events in the hypocalcaemia were mild or moderate in 
severity (Table 2.13). One (0.3%) subject each in the etelcalcetide and cinacalcet treatment arms in the 
active-controlled study and no subjects in the placebo-controlled studies had a serious adverse event of blood 
calcium decreased. No subject had a serious adverse event of hypocalaemia.  A total of 5 (1.0%) subjects in 
the etelcalcetide arm had events of hypocalcaemia that led to discontinuation of investigational product.

Table 2.13 Overview of treatment-emergent events of interest. Hypocalcaemia. 6-month 
placebo/active-controlled pool (Safety Analysis Set). 
Secondary to low calcium, rates of events potentially associated with increased neuromuscular 
irritability were also higher versus placebo and mainly consisted of paresthesia (4.8% etelcalcetide; 0.6% 
placebo), hypoesthesia (1.8% etelcalcetide; 0.8% placebo), and myalgia (1.6% etelcalcetide; 0.2% placebo). 
In the active controlled study, these events were reported at comparable or somewhat higher frequencies for 
etelcalcetide compared to cinacalcet (paresthesia: 2.1% etelcalcetide vs 1.8% cinacalcet; hypoesthesia 
(1.2% etelcalcetide vs 0.9% cinacalcet; myalgia: 1.5% etelcalcetide vs 0.6% cinacalcet).  
The rates of adverse events potentially associated with the effect of decreased calcium on cardiac 
repolarization (syncope, convulsion, sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, 
ventricular tachyarrhythmia) were similar between etelcalcetide and placebo or cinacalcet (Table 2.14). 
The percentage of subjects with adverse events of convulsions (SMQ) was low and similar between 
treatment groups in the placebo-controlled studies (0.8% etelcalcetide; 1.0% placebo) and active-controlled 
study (0.9% etelcalcetide; 0.6% cinacalcet). No events were fatal. One subject in the etelcalcetide arm in the 
placebo-controlled study had convulsion concurrent with both blood calcium decreased and hypocalcaemia. 
etelcalcetide was temporarily withheld and corrected calcium returned to normal and the subject continued in 
the study. 
The subject incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (SMQ) (0.4% etelcalcetide; 0.8% placebo and (0% 
etelcalcetide; 0% cinacalcet) was low and similar in both etelcalcetide versus placebo or cinacalcet. Two 
(0.4%) subjects in the etelcalcetide group and no subjects in the placebo group had ventricular tachycardia 
(Table 2.14). Both subjects continued drug without similar events. The events were not considered related to 
etelcalcetide. No subjects in the etelcalcetide group and 1 (0.2%) subject in the placebo group had 
ventricular tachyarrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation. There were no cases of Torsade de pointes.  
Within the phase 3 open-label extension combined dataset, the crude subject incidence and exposure-
adjusted incidence rates of adverse events of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (0.6%, 0.9 per 100 subject-years) 
were low. One subject (0.1%, 0.1 per 100 subject-years) had Torsade de pointes. The subject remained on 
etelcalcetide (dose not changed). The investigator assessed the event of Torsade de pointes as not related to 
etelcalcetide.

Table 2.14 Subject incidence of treatment emergent adverse events potentially associated with 
drug effect on cardiac repolarization (6-month placebo/active controlled combined dataset – 
Safety Analysis Set). 
Although incidence was low, slightly higher incidence of Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation 
(1.2% etelcalcetide vs 0.6% placebo; 0.3% etelcalcetide vs 0% cinacalcet) were found. Within the phase 3 
open-label extension combined dataset, the crude subject incidence and exposure-adjusted incidence rates of 
Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation (0.4%, 0.5 per 100 subject-years) were low. Within the placebo-
controlled studies, 12-lead ECGs (triplicate; central independently assessed) and blood samples for the 
assessment of etelcalcetide and serum cCA concentrations were collected predialysis and 10 to 30 minutes 
after haemodialysis on day 1 and weeks 5, 13, and 26, or at early termination (predialysis only). A higher 
percentage of subjects in the etelcalcetide treatment group compared with placebo had shifts in QTcF, 
postbaseline QTcF, or maximum increase from baseline of > 30 to 60 msec or > 60 msec (see Table 
2.15). 
The most common (≥ 1%) adverse event potentially associated with a drug effect on cardiac repolarization in 
the phase 3 open-label extension combined dataset terms was syncope (1.7%, 2.4 per 100 subject-years). 
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of sudden death was 0.3 per 100 subject-years, which was lower than 
the exposure-adjusted incidence rate reported in the placebo arm of EVOLVE (0.7 per 100 subject-years).

adjudicated confirmed congestive heart failure requiring hospitalisation and myocardial infarction 
was higher for etelcalcetide treatment group both in the placebo-controlled studies and active controlled 
study.

About 3% of subjects in the etelcalcetide arm had cardiac failure (3.2% etelcalcetide versus 2.5% placebo, 
3.0% etelcalcetide versus 0.6% cinacalcet). Although some numerical differences were noted in the subject

incidence of adverse events in the cardiac failure in the etelcalcetide arm compared to placebo and 
cinacalcet, the rate was consistent with the 6-month background rate of 3.3% in the placebo arm of the 
EVOLVE study, a large cardiovascular outcomes study conducted in subjects with CKD on dialysis.  
In the placebo-controlled studies, severe, life-threatening, or fatal events of cardiac failure were similar 
(Table 2.17). Three (0.9%) subjects had fatal adverse events of cardiac failure with etelcalcetide in the active 
controlled study:  2 (0.6%) subjects had cardiac failure acute, and 1 (0.3%) subject had cardiac failure.  
None of the fatal adverse events were associated with low serum corrected calcium. All cases involved 
subjects with numerous co-morbid conditions that likely contributed to the events of cardiac failure, and the 
investigator assessed all 3 events as not related to study drug. No pattern of temporal associations of cardiac 
heart failure cases with etelcalcetide exposure was observed in placebo-controlled studies or the active-
controlled study. 
Table 2.17 Overview of treatment emergent events of interest. Cardiac failure. 6-months 
placebo/active-controlled pool (Safety Analysis Set). 
A higher proportion of etelcalcetide had events in the hypophosphatemia; 1.4% etelcalcetide versus 0.4% 
placebo in the placebo–controlled studies and 1.5% etelcalcetide versus 0.9% cinacalcet in the active 
controlled study. Most events of hypophosphatemia were mild (7 events) or moderate (5 events), with no 
severe events reported. None of the events in the etelcalcetide arms were serious or resulted in 
discontinuation of the investigational product. One (0.3%) subject in the cinacalcet arm had a 
hypophosphatemia event that was serious and led to discontinuation of investigational product.       
About 20% of patients in the etelcalcetide arm experienced infusion reactions; 19.7% etelcalcetide versus 
17.7% placebo and 20.1% etelcalcetide versus 15.5% cinacalcet in the placebo and active controlled studies, 
respectively. The subject incidence was primarily driven by events that constituted nondescript constitutional 
symptoms such as hypertension, hypotension, and pyrexia, which are commonly observed in the CKD patient

population. Hypertension (6.2% etelcalcetide; 5.7% placebo), hypotension (6.0% etelcalcetide; 5.1% 
placebo), and pyrexia (4.0% etelcalcetide; 3.9% placebo) were balanced between the etelcalcetide and 
placebo groups.  Most infusion reactions were mild or moderate in severity. In the placebo-active combined 
dataset, 1 subject in each treatment arm had an event that led to discontinuation and 1 subject, except for 
the cinacalcet arm, had a fatal event.  
The subject incidences of hypersensitivity were similar in the etelcalcetide and comparator arm (4.4% 
etelcalcetide versus 3.7% placebo, and 5.6% etelcalcetide versus 5.0% cinacalcet) in the placebo-controlled 
and active controlled study, respectively. Two (0.4%) subjects in the etelcalcetide arm of the placebo-
controlled studies had serious adverse events (palpable purpura and shock). These were not considered 
related to study drug. Three subjects in the etelcalcetide group of the active-controlled study discontinued 
study drug due to adverse events. One event of bronchospasm, and 2 subjects experienced dermatitis, which 
were non-serious and considered related to etelcalcetide. The one non-serious event of bronchospasm led to 
discontinuation. The rates of individual adverse events suggestive of hypersensitivity (e.g., rash, rash 
pruritic, urticaria, eyelid edema, and periorbital edema) were infrequent and balanced between etelcalcetide 
and placebo groups. No serious events indicative of anaphylactic-type reactions were reported in the 
etelcalcetide arms in either the placebo-controlled studies or the active-controlled study. Possible 
hypersensitivity and infusion reaction adverse events were analyzed by anti-drug antibody status in the 
placebo-controlled studies. Of the 13 subjects who had positive binding antibody post-baseline with a 
negative or no result at baseline, 1 (7.7%) subject had a potential hypersensitivity or infusion reaction-
related adverse event (pyrexia); this event was unlikely to be related to the development of post-baseline 
binding antibodies to etelcalcetide. Although drug-induced hypersensitivity remains a potential risk with 
etelcalcetide, the potential hypersensitivity and infusion reaction adverse events identified using pre-specified 
search criteria were not attributed to etelcalcetide, and there was no evidence of an association of 
hypersensitivity or infusion reaction adverse events with anti-drug antibody status.   
The subject incidence of events in the fractures was lower for etelcalcetide in the placebo-controlled studies 
(1.6% etelcalcetide; 2.9% placebo) and similar in the etelcalcetide and cinacalcet arms in the active-
controlled study (2.1% etelcalcetide; 2.6% cinacalcet). In the placebo-controlled studies, approximately half 
of all events were severe. In the active-controlled study, most events in the etelcalcetide arm were mild or 
moderate, and approximately half of events in the cinacalcet arm were severe. A total of 27 subjects (2.1%; 
3.0 per 100 subject-years) in the phase 3 long-term open-label extension combined dataset had events in 
the fractures.  Fifteen subjects (1.2%) had severe events. No events were fatal or led to discontinuation of 
the investigational product.

Table 2.18 Overview of type of fractures in the placebo controlled studies and the active 
controlled study 
No subjects in either treatment group had adynamic bone adverse events.  
In the placebo-controlled studies, dialysis vascular access thrombosis events (6.0% etelcalcetide; 5.8% 
placebo) were similar. In the active-controlled study, a lower proportion of etelcalcetide subjects had these 
events (3.0% etelcalcetide; 4.7% cinacalcet). Most events were mild or moderate in severity. No events were 
fatal or led to discontinuation of investigational product. 
In the placebo-controlled studies, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for etelcalcetide were determined as 
those that occurred in ≥ 5% of etelcalcetide subjects and with a ≥ 1% greater frequency than placebo 
subjects.  In the absence of the placebo arm, the difference in the event frequency in the etelcalcetide arm 
compared to the event frequency in the control group was not taken into consideration in the active-
controlled study. Events in that occurred at a rate < 5% were also medically reviewed and included as 
adverse drug reactions based on biological plausibility, pharmacology, and medical importance as well as the 
difference in the events’ frequency from placebo. Events that were considered adverse drug reactions are 
presented in Table 2.19. The majority of ADRs in both the placebo- and active controlled studies were mild to 
moderate in severity and no apparent differences were seen between treatment groups for both the placebo 
and active controlled studies.

In the placebo-controlled studies, 130 subjects (25.8%) in the etelcalcetide group and 149 subjects (29.0%) 
in the placebo group had a serious adverse event. In the active-controlled study, 85 subjects (25.1%) in 
the etelcalcetide group and 93 subjects (27.3%) in the cinacalcet group had serious adverse events. 
The most frequently reported serious adverse events in the placebo controlled studies (≥ 1% of subjects in 
the etelcalcetide arm) were hyperkalaemia (2.0% etelcalcetide; 0.4% placebo), pneumonia (2.0% 
etelcalcetide; 2.7% placebo), angina pectoris (1.4% etelcalcetide; 0.6% placebo), fluid overload (1.2% 
etelcalcetide; 1.4% placebo), atrial fibrillation (1.0% etelcalcetide; 1.0% placebo) and cardiac failure 
congestive (1.0% etelcalcetide; 1.0% placebo) (Table 2.20).  Hyperkalaemia and angina pectoris were more 
frequently reported for etelcalcetide. The only serious adverse event that occurred in ≥ 1% of subjects in the 
etelcalcetide arm of the active controlled study was gangrene (4 subjects [1.2%] etelcalcetide; 0 subjects 
[0%] cinacalcet). No subject had a serious adverse event of hypocalcaemia.

Table 2.20  Subject incidence of serious treatment emergent adverse events occurring in ≥1% of 
subjects in any pooled treatment arm (6-month placebo/active-controlled combined dataset – 
Safety Analysis Set. 
None of the hyperkalaemia events in either group in the placebo controlled studies were assessed by the 
investigator as related to study medication. All subjects in the etelcalcetide arm had major risk factors for 
hyperkalaemia at the time of the event, such as missed dialysis sessions, noncompliance with a 
low-potassium diet, and low serum bicarbonate. All subjects in the etelcalcetide arm recovered and continued 
with the study without re-occurrence of hyperkalaemia with the exception of 1 subject who reported a second 
episode of hyperkalaemia 1.5 month after restarting treatment. The investigator assessed both events as not 
related to etelcalcetide because of co-morbid conditions as well as the presence of alternative causalities.   
Only a numerical imbalance for angina pectoris was reported in study 20120229 (2.4% etelcalcetide; 0.4% 
placebo) and not for study 20120230 (0.4% etelcalcetide; 0.8% placebo). All cases of angina pectoris had 
numerous confounding factors at baseline for ischemic heart disease, such as diabetes mellitus, coronary 
artery disease, and myocardial infarction. None of these events were assessed as related to etelcalcetide by 
the investigator. None of the events resulted in any dose modifications of etelcalcetide. In addition, a review 
of baseline medical history in Study 20120229 revealed significantly higher rates of pre-existing co-morbid 
conditions in the etelcalcetide arm compared to placebo. The higher rates of pre-existing co-morbid 
conditions related to major domains of cardiovascular risks in the etelcalcetide arm compared to placebo in 
the 20120229 study is a likely explanation of the observed imbalance in the rates of on-treatment events of 
angina pectoris in this study.  No significant imbalances in pre-existing conditions related to ischemic disease 
were noted in the 20120230 study.

A total of 376 subjects (29.2%; 51.2 per 100 subject-years) in the phase 3 long-term open-label extension 
combined dataset had serious adverse events. The most frequently reported (> 1%) serious adverse events 
were hyperkalaemia (2.2%; 3.1 per 100 subject-years), pneumonia (1.6%; 2.2 per 100 subject-years), 
cardiac failure congestive (1.5%; 2.1 per 100 subject-years), syncope (1.2%; 1.6 per 100 subject-years), 
cellulitis (1.1%; 1.5 per 100 subject-years), fluid overload (1.1%; 1.5 per 100 subject-years),and sepsis 
(1.1%; 1.5 per 100 subject-years).  
A total of 11 subjects (2.2%) in the etelcalcetide group and 15 subjects (2.9%) in the placebo group had 
treatment emergent fatal adverse events.  The causes of death in both the etelcalcetide and placebo arms 
were consistent with the population’s baseline comorbid conditions and similar to causes of death in the 
general population of patients with CKD on dialysis. With the exception of 1 case, none of the events with 
fatal outcomes were assessed as related to investigational product.  
Four additional subjects (3 etelcalcetide and 1 placebo) had fatal events that occurred after the follow-up 
period of 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. The causes of death were reported as chronic renal 
failure, sudden cardiac death, and gastrointestinal haemorrhage for patients that received prior on 
etelcalcetide, one, cardiac valve disease was reported in the placebo group. 
A total of 9 subjects (2.7%) in the etelcalcetide group and 6 subjects (1.8%) in the cinacalcet group had 
treatment emergent fatal adverse events in the active controlled study. Acute cardiac failure was reported 
in 2 subjects (0.6%) in etelcalcetide and 0 subjects in cinacalcet. Two additional subjects had fatal events 
that occurred after the safety follow-up period of 30 days. One subject in the etelcalcetide group had a fatal 
event of chronic renal failure, and 1 subject in the cinacalcet group had a fatal event of acute myocardial 
infarction after the follow-up period.  None of the fatal adverse events were considered to be related to the 
investigational product.

Analysis Set) 
A total of 47 subjects (3.6%; 5.1 per 100 subject-years) in the phase 3 long-term open-label extension 
combined dataset had fatal adverse events. The most common fatal adverse events were cardiac arrest 
(9 subjects (0.7%); 1.0 per 100 subject-years), sepsis (3 subjects (0.2%); 0.3 per 100 subject-years), 
sudden death (3 subjects (0.2%); 0.3 per 100 subject-years), ventricular fibrillation (3 subjects (0.2%); 0.3 
per 100 subject-years), cardiac failure (2 subjects (0.2%); 0.2 per 100 subject-years), cardio-respiratory 
arrest (2 subjects (0.2%); 0.2 per 100 subject-years), cerebral haemorrhage (2 subjects (0.2%); 0.2 per 
100 subject-years), and septic shock (2 subjects (0.2%); 0.2 per 100 subject-years).  Compared with the 
phase 3 open-label extension combined dataset, the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of cardiac arrest (1.3

per 100 subject-years cinacalcet; 1.3 per 100 subject-years placebo) and sudden death (0.5 per 100 subject-
years cinacalcet; 0.7 per 100 subject-years placebo) in the EVOLVE study was similar. 
Laboratory findings 
Reductions in PTH were evaluated as efficacy endpoints in the placebo and active controlled studies. These 
are discussed within the efficacy section. 
In the combined placebo-controlled studies, a higher proportion of patients in the Parsabiv group 
compared with patients in the placebo group developed at least one serum corrected calcium value 
< 7.0 mg/dL (7.6% etelcalcetide; 3.1% placebo), < 7.5 mg/dL (27.1% etelcalcetide; 5.5% placebo), and 
< 8.3 mg/dL (78.6% etelcalcetide; 19.4% placebo) (Table 2.22). 
In the placebo controlled studies more shifts from grade 0 to grade 3 of decreased corrected calcium 
(corrected calcium between 6-<7 mg/dL; 6.0% etelcalcetide; 1.9% placebo) were found for etelcalcetide; 
however, shifts to grade 4 decreased corrected calcium were similar (corrected calcium < 6.0 mg/dL; 1.4% 
etelcalcetide; 1.0% placebo). In the active controlled study, proportion of shifts from grade 0 to grade 3 
decreased corrected calcium was slightly lower for etelcalcetide (5.9% etelcalcetide; 7.0% cinacalcet), while 
slightly higher for grade 4 decreased corrected calcium (2.1% etelcalcetide; 1.2% cinacalcet). 
A similar proportion of etelcalcetide and cinacalcet subjects had ≥ 1 postbaseline corrected calcium 
concentration < 7.0 mg/dL (8.6% etelcalcetide; 9.5% cinacalcet) and < 7.5 mg/dL (26.5% etelcalcetide; 
26.7% cinacalcet). A higher proportion of etelcalcetide subjects had ≥ 1 postbaseline corrected calcium 
concentration < 8.3 mg/dL (82.7% etelcalcetide; 72.7% cinacalcet) (Table 2.22). 
Table 2.22 Exposure adjusted and crude subject incidence rate of post-baseline low serum 
corrected calcium values 6- Month Placebo/Active-Controlled Pool (Safety Analysis Set). 
A total of 133 subjects in the placebo-controlled studies and 79 subjects in the active controlled study had a 
least 1 incident of corrected calcium < 7.5 mg/dL that led to the etelcalcetide dose being withheld. 
The median Kaplan Meier estimate of time to recovery was 2.1 weeks and 2.9 weeks in the placebo-
controlled studies and active-controlled study, respectively. Of the 113 subjects in the placebo-controlled 
studies who had at least 1 incident of corrected calcium < 7.5 mg/dL that led to the etelcalcetide dose being 
withheld, 104 (92.0%) subjects had corrected calcium recovery to ≥ 8.3 mg/dL, and the median Kaplan 
Meier estimate of time to recovery was 2.1 weeks. A total of 87.5% had corrected calcium value recovery at 
4 weeks, and 99.0% recovered at 7 weeks. Of the 79 subjects in the active controlled study who had at least 
1 incident of corrected calcium < 7.5 mg/dL that led to the etelcalcetide dose being withheld, 76 (96.2%) 
subjects had corrected calcium recovery to ≥ 8.3 mg/dL, and the Kaplan Meier estimate of median time to

recovery was 2.9 weeks. Calcium corrected value recovered in almost all patients within 8 weeks. These 
results demonstrate that temporarily discontinuing etelcalcetide and protocol-specified treatment 
(adjustments in dialysate calcium, vitamin D sterols, or calcium supplements) were effective in allowing 
calcium values to recover. 
Starting from the beginning of the open-label extension study, by 6 months, corrected calcium was 
< 7.0 mg/dL for 43 subjects (3.4%; 9.3 per 100 subject-years), < 7.5 mg/dL for 158 subjects (12.4%; 36.2 
per 100 subject-years), and < 8.3 mg/dL for 710 subjects (55.9%; 251.0 per 100 subject-years). By 12 
months, corrected calcium was < 7.0 mg/dL for 53 subjects (4.2%; 7.3 per 100 subject-years), < 7.5 mg/dL 
for 191 subjects (15.0%; 28.8 per 100 subject-years), and < 8.3 mg/dL for 784 subjects (61.7%; 211.1 per 
100 subject-years.  By 18 months, corrected calcium was < 7.0 mg/dL for 54 subjects (4.3%; 7.1 per 
100 subject-years), < 7.5 mg/dL for 193 subjects (15.2%; 28.1 per 100 subject-years), and < 8.3 mg/dL for 
792 subjects (62.4%; 210.1 per 100 subject-years). These results indicate that the incidence of decreases in 
calcium is relatively stable over time (Table 2.23).

Subjects in the etelcalcetide treatment group had a higher subject incidence of shifts from grade 0 to 
grade 3 decreased phosphorus (1-<2.0 mg/dL) -in the placebo-controlled studies (10.5% etelcalcetide; 
4.1% placebo). A similar proportion of subjects in the etelcalcetide and cinacalcet treatment groups had

shifts from grade 0 to grade 3 decreased phosphorus (5.9% etelcalcetide; 4.1% cinacalcet). No shifts to 
grade 4 were observed in the placebo-controlled studies or the active-controlled study. 
Within the parent etelcalcetide through open-label extension combined dataset, a total of 95 subjects 
(11.3%) had shifts from grade 0 to grade 3 decreased phosphorus.  
A higher proportion of subjects in the etelcalcetide arm had at least 1 potassium concentration 
> 5.5 mmol/L compared with the placebo arm (31.0% etelcalcetide; 27.0% placebo). No imbalance was 
observed between groups in the proportions of subjects with more severe threshold categories of potassium 
concentrations: > 6 mmol/L (10.4% etelcalcetide; 9.3% placebo) or > 7 mmol/L (1.0% etelcalcetide; 1.8% 
placebo). Adverse events of hyperkalaemia and blood potassium have been described above. 
A similar proportion of subjects had shifts from grade 0 to grade 3 decreased potassium in both the 
placebo-controlled studies (0.6% etelcalcetide; 0.4% placebo) and active-controlled study (0.3% 
etelcalcetide; 0% cinacalcet). In the placebo-controlled studies, a higher proportion of subjects in the 
etelcalcetide arm had shifts from grade 0 to grade 3 increased potassium (4.6% etelcalcetide; 1.6% 
placebo); however, similar proportions of subjects had shifts from grade 0 to grade 4 increased potassium 
(0.4% etelcalcetide; 0.6% placebo). No subjects in the active-controlled study had shifts from grade 0 to 
grade 3 or 4 increased potassium. 
Within the parent etelcalcetide through open-label extension combined dataset, a total of 43 subjects (5.1%) 
had shifts from grade 0 to grade 3 increased potassium, and 7 subjects (0.8%) had shifts from grade 0 to 
grade 4 increased potassium. 
In the evaluation of liver parameters. less than 1% of subjects in any treatment group in the 
placebo/active-controlled combined dataset had shifts from grade 0 to grade 3 increased ALT, grade 0 to 
grade 4 increased AST, and grade 0 to grade 3 increased bilirubin. No subjects had shifts from grade 0 to 
grade 4 increased ALT or bilirubin or grade 0 to grade 3 increased AST. No subjects had laboratory values 
that met the criteria for potential Hy’s law cases.  The proportions of subjects with elevations in ALT, AST, 
and bilirubin were similar in the placebo and etelcalcetide arms. 
In the long term study data, two subjects (0.2%) had ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN at 
any visit, and both subjects received placebo in the parent studies.  A medical review of these cases 
suggested underlying comorbidities that contributed to the abnormal liver tests; therefore, these subjects did 
not meet Hy’s law criteria. 
No clinically significant trends were noted in other serum chemistry or haematology parameters 
Safety in special populations 
In the 6-Month placebo controlled pool, subjects in the etelcalcetide group with a screening PTH 
concentration of 600 pg/mL to ≤ 1000 pg/mL had the highest subject incidence of treatment emergent 
adverse events (94.1%) compared with subjects with a screening PTH concentration < 600 pg/mL (88.8%) 
or > 1000 pg/mL (91.1%). Etelcalcetide subjects with a screening PTH > 1000 pg/mL had a lower subject 
incidence of serious adverse events (21.4%) compared with subjects with screening PTH of 600 to ≤ 1000 
pg/mL (26.2%) or < 600 pg/mL (28.2%). Although placebo subjects had a similar subject incidence of 
treatment emergent adverse events regardless of screening PTH, subjects with screening PTH > 1000 pg/mL 
had a higher subject incidence of treatment emergent serious adverse events (35.1%) compared with 
subjects with screening PTH < 600 pg/mL (27.8%) and 600 pg/mL to ≤ 1000 pg/mL (27.0%).

Etelcalcetide subjects with screening PTH of 600 pg/mL to ≤ 1000 pg/mL had a higher subject incidence of 
blood calcium decreased (67.4%) and hypocalcaemia (9.0%) compared with subjects with screening PTH < 
600 pg/mL (55.3% blood calcium decreased and 4.1% hypocalcaemia).  Etelcalcetide subjects with screening 
PTH > 1000 pg/mL had the highest subject incidence of blood calcium decreased (69.6%) and a subject 
incidence of hypocalcaemia of 7.1%. Placebo subjects with screening PTH of 600 pg/mL to ≤ 1000 pg/mL had 
a higher subject incidence of blood calcium decreased (11.2%) compared with subjects with screening PTH < 
600 pg/mL (9.5%) and > 1000 pg/mL (9.0%). The subject incidence of hypocalcaemia was similar regardless 
of screening PTH. 
For the 6-month placebo-controlled combined dataset, subgroup analyses of adverse events were performed 
for region: north America, Europe, and other. The other region included Australia, Israel, and the Russian 
Federation.  In the etelcalcetide group, subjects in Europe (94.2%) and other (94.7%) regions had a higher 
subject incidence of treatment emergent adverse events compared with subjects in North America (89.5%). 
Subjects in Europe (19.9%) and other (21.1%) regions had a lower subject incidence of serious adverse 
events compared with subjects in North America (30.5%). 
Etelcalcetide subjects in other regions had the highest subject incidence of blood calcium decreased (82.5%) 
and hypocalcaemia (17.5%), followed by subjects in Europe (66.7% blood calcium decreased and 7.0% 
hypocalcaemia) and subjects in North America (58.2% blood calcium decreased and 4.7% hypocalcaemia). A 
similar pattern was observed in placebo subjects. 
A similar subject incidence of men and women had treatment emergent adverse events in both the 
etelcalcetide (90.3% male versus 93.8% female) and placebo treatment groups (80.6% male versus 78.9% 
female).  A higher proportion of women in both groups had treatment emergent serious adverse events 
compared with men (30.3% women vs 23.1% men etelcalcetide; 34.4% women vs 25.3% men placebo). 
However, the incidence of serious adverse events was comparable or numerically lower in the etelcalcetide 
arm than the placebo arm for both men and women. 
A higher proportion of men than women in the etelcalcetide group had blood calcium decreased (66.2% vs 
60.0%) and hypocalcaemia (8.1% vs 5.1%), while the subject incidence of both events was similar in men 
and women in the placebo group. 
In the etelcalcetide treatment group, a similar proportion of subjects aged < 65 years and ≥ 65 years had 
treatment emergent adverse events (Table 2.24). The subject incidences of treatment emergent adverse 
events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, and fatal adverse events were 
higher in subjects ≥ 65 years compared with subjects < 65 years in the placebo group, and the subject 
incidences of treatment emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and fatal adverse events were 
highest in subjects ≥ 75 years. The subject incidence of treatment emergent fatal adverse events was 
higher in the placebo group compared to the etelcalcetide group in subjects ≥ 65 years (2.8% etelcalcetide; 
5.1% placebo) and ≥ 75 years (1.4% etelcalcetide; 7.8% placebo). 
A higher proportion of subjects aged < 65 years in both groups had blood calcium decreased (67.8% 
etelcalcetide; 11.3% placebo) and hypocalcaemia (8.6% etelcalcetide; 0.3% placebo) compared with 
subjects aged ≥ 65 years (blood calcium decreased 56.5% etelcalcetide, 7.9% placebo; hypocalcaemia 4.0% 
etelcalcetide, 0% placebo).

A further specification of adverse events of interest for the elderly population by age groups (<65 yrs, 65-74 
yrs, 75-84 yrs and 85 yrs and above) did not reveal any safety signal. Of note, the age group above 85 years 
of age is small (n=10 in both treatment groups), precluding any conclusions for this age group. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The biotransformation products of etelcalcetide are mixed disulfides that arise from a reversible disulfide 
exchange reaction of the L-cysteine moiety of etelcalcetide with other etelcalcetide molecules or endogenous 
thiols, such as albumin or glutathione. This thiol exchange is the primary route of biotransformation.  
Nonclinical studies demonstrated that etelcalcetide was not subject to metabolism by hepatic cytochrome 
P450 enzymes, was not an inhibitor or inducer of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, and was not a 
substrate or inhibitor of common drug transporters, suggesting that there is a low risk of pharmacokinetic 
drug-drug interactions. Therefore, clinical drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 
Data from cell-based assays suggest a simple additive effect on the CaSR when cinacalcet and etelcalcetide 
are administered together. An in vitro study with HEK293T cell lines stably transfected with the human CaSR 
(R20130030) determined that co-administration of etelcalcetide and cinacalcet HCl resulted in simple additive 
effect rather than super-additivity. Therefore, co-administration may pose an increased risk of 
hypocalcaemia. In a single-arm study designed to evaluate whether treatment with 5 mg etelcalcetide given 
3 times a week could be safely initiated 7 days after cinacalcet therapy is discontinued, a low subject 
incidence of corrected calcium < 7.5 mg/dL (0.7%) during the 4-week treatment period was observed with 
no events of symptomatic hypocalcaemia (Study 20120359). Corrected calcium concentrations should be ≥ 
8.3 mg/dL before cinacalcet can be initiated after discontinuation of etelcalcetide. 
No drug interaction studies have been conducted with other compounds that reduce calcium.  Etelcalcetide 
should be administered with caution and calcium more closely monitored when patients are taking these 
therapeutics. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Within the placebo-controlled studies, a total of 9 (1.8%) subjects in the etelcalcetide group and 13 (2.5%) 
subjects in the placebo group discontinued due to an adverse event. The most common adverse events 
leading to discontinuation was blood calcium decreased (n=5 1.0% etelcalcetide; 0.0% placebo). No other 
adverse event led to discontinuation in more than 1 subject in the etelcalcetide arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 79/98 
  
  
A total of 8 subjects (%) had adverse events leading to discontinuation that were considered to be related 
to study treatment: decreased blood calcium (n=5), nausea and vomiting (both events in the same 
subject), and hyperhidrosis and gastrointestinal malformation (gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformation; 
both events in the same subject), and chest discomfort and hemiparesis (both in the same subject). 
Within the active-controlled study, a total of 19 (5.6%) subjects in the etelcalcetide group and 16 (4.7%) 
subjects in the cinacalcet group discontinued due to an adverse event. The most frequently reported 
(> 1 subject in the etelcalcetide arm) events that led to the discontinuation were vomiting (n=3 0.9% 
etelcalcetide; n=1 0.3% cinacalcet), nausea (n=2 0.6% etelcalcetide; n=1 0.9% cinacalcet), and dermatitis 
(n=2 0.6% etelcalcetide; 0% cinacalcet). 
Twenty-two subjects (10 subjects etelcalcetide, 12 subjects cinacalcet) had adverse events leading to the 
discontinuation of investigational product that were considered to be related to study treatment. These 
were vomiting (3 subjects), nausea and dermatitis (2 subjects each), and bronchospasm, increased hepatic 
enzyme, muscular weakness, and decreased weight (1 subject each) for etelcalcetide. In the cinacalcet 
group, these were nausea (3 subjects), asymptomatic decreased blood calcium (2 subjects), and abdominal 
pain, cardiac arrest, convulsion, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, hypophosphatemia, optic neuritis, upper 
abdominal pain, and vomiting (1 subject each). 
A total of 39 subjects (3.0%; 4.3 per 100 subject-years) in the phase 3 long-term open-label extension 
combined dataset had adverse events leading to discontinuation. The most common (≥ 2 subjects) adverse 
events leading to discontinuation were nausea (0.4%; 0.5 per 100 subject-years), cardiac arrest (0.3%; 
0.4 per 100 subject-years), vomiting (0.3%; 0.4 per 100 subject-years), cellulitis (0.2%; 0.2 per 100 
subject-years), and hypocalcaemia (0.2%; 0.2 per 100 subject-years). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of etelcalcetide was studied in a patient population representative of the intended target 
population on haemodialysis, except that vulnerable patient groups were excluded from the studies (history 
of certain cardiac disorders in the past 6 months such as myocardial infarction, CHF III or IV, ventricular 
arrhythmia). Within phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies, a total of 1655 subjects received at least 1 dose of 
etelcalcetide of which 499 received etelcalcetide for over 1 year. This is mandatory given the chronic nature 
of treatment and in agreement with guideline recommendations. The most frequently used dose was 5 mg 
which is the recommended initial dose to be given by bolus injection 3 times per week. About 12% of 
patients received the maximal dose of 15 mg during most of the time. Therefore, the safety profile was 
assessed over the recommended dose range. A dose-response relationship of adverse events was not shown, 
but this should be interpreted cautiously as the dose is titrated over time.  In addition, no distinct relationship 
between fast titration and AE incidences was shown.  
The percentage of patients with any TEAE was high, which is to be expected in this population with extensive 
co-morbidity. Most events were of mild to moderate nature and discontinuations due to adverse events were 
limited (1.8% in placebo-controlled studies and 5.6% in the active controlled study). Long term open label 
safety data were mostly in line with the controlled safety data, however, frequency of some AEs seems to 
slightly decrease over time in the long-term follow-up studies, suggesting an increased vulnerability of 
patients starting treatment and an adaptation to the treatment in the long term. The AE pattern appears 
comparable between the titration and stable phase.   
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 80/98 
  
  
Overall, the safety profile was dominated by events related to etelcalcetides primary and secondary 
mechanisms of action of lowering PTH levels and calcium levels. Therefore, patients have to be closely 
monitored during the titration phase and during the remainder of the study and should not be treated when 
serum calcium levels were below the lower limit of the normal range (exclusion criteria in clinical studies). 
The most frequently reported adverse event was asymptomatic blood calcium decreased (63.8% etelcalcetide 
vs 10.1% placebo and 68.9% etelcalcetide vs 59.8% cinacalcet). A contraindication not to use etelcalcetide 
when the corrected calcium level is below the lower limit of the normal range can be in principle accepted, 
given the frequent observations of calcium decrease.  
Furthermore, symptomatic events of hypocalcaemia were reported in 7.0% (placebo-controlled studies) and 
5.0% (active controlled study) of patients and more often for etelcalcetide than for cinacalcet (2.3%). 
Although these events of decreased calcium levels were mild to moderate in severity, transient, and rarely 
resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug (n=5 placebo-controlled studies), about one quarter to 
one third of patients on etelcalcetide temporary discontinued treatment due to low serum calcium levels. 
Additional information on treatment discontinuation did not reveal additional safety concerns. No dose-
dependent increase in the rate and durations of dose withholds with etelcalcetide was observed.  
In addition, potential adverse events associated with low calcium levels were further explored. Worsening 
heart failure has already been identified as a risk for cinacalcet. Higher incidences of AEs of cardiac failure 
(3.2% etelcalcetide; 2.5% placebo and 3.0% etelcalcetide versus 0.6% cinacalcet), independent adjudicated 
events of congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization (2.2% etelcalcetide versus 1.2% placebo) and MI 
(1.6% etelcalcetide versus 1.0% placebo) have been reported for etelcalcetide and are of potential concern. 
Whether a causal relationship exists is difficult to ascertain given that these cases were confounded by 
comorbidities commonly seen in haemodialysis patients, but they appear not to be related to hypocalcaemia. 
Moreover, the number of events is limited which does not allow to draw firm conclusions. As potentially 
vulnerable patient groups were excluded from the studies (history of certain cardiac disorders in the past 6 
months such as myocardial infarction, CHF III or IV, ventricular arrhythmia), incidences might be higher in 
real practice, as a CKD patient population on haemodialysis is known to be at risk for cardiovascular 
comorbidity. However, the overall subject incidence of cardiac failure events appears similar to that observed 
in both placebo and cinacalcet groups during the first 6 months of the EVOLVE study. Yet, the applicant has 
proposed a warning statement on the risk of worsening heart failure in section 4.4 of SmPC and included it as 
a potential risk in the RMP, which is supported.  
The risk for QT prolongation is also thought to be associated with reductions of serum calcium and has been 
identified in the cinacalcet dossier. Similarly, a higher incidence of QT prolongation has been observed with 
etelcalcetide in comparison to placebo (> 500 msec 4.8% etelcalcetide vs 1.9% placebo). No data are 
available in comparison to cinacalcet. In vitro evaluation on  hERG channels and preclinical safety 
pharmacology data in dogs showed that the QTc prolongation was associated with calcium levels and not 
directly to the drug. Moreover, an analysis on the phase 3 data adjusting for the calcium effect did not 
identify any direct QT prolonging effect of etelcalcetide, which is reassuring. Events possibly associated with 
QT prolongation such as ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, convulsions, and sudden deaths were very limited 
and not different between treatment groups. No meaningful differences in QTcF prolongations across age 
groups were detected in response to etelcalcetide.  However, an absence of adverse events potentially 
associated with QTc prolongation does not allow for any firm conclusions, as these events are generally 
sparse and thus the potential to find any difference is low. The applicant has now proposed warnings on the 
risk of ventricular arrhythmia, and QT prolongations in section 4.4 of SmPC and included these as identified 
risks (QT prolongations) or potential risks (ventricular arrhythmia) in the RMP. This is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 81/98 
  
  
In addition, QT prolongation has been included as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC because of the 
increased frequency with etelcalcetide.  
Also, a warning on convulsions is included in section 4.4 and identified as a potential risk in the RMP which is 
considered appropriate.   
Other events like muscle spasms, myalgia and paraesthesia which can occur as manifestations of 
hypocalcaemia were found to be higher than placebo and are included in section 4.8 of the SmPC, which is 
considered appropriate. Incidences were numerically slightly higher but in the same order of magnitude for 
etelcalcetide compared to cinacalcet.  
Phosphate reduction is also related to the reduction of PTH and phosphate levels will be regularly monitored 
in the patient population. Hypophosphatemia was also higher for etelcalcetide than for cinacalcet, likely due 
to the stronger PTH decreasing effect (1.5% etelcalcetide versus 0.9% cinacalcet).  
Besides effects associated with PTH reduction, gastrointestinal adverse events were also frequently reported. 
Adverse events considered potentially related to etelcalcetide were nausea (10.7-18.3%), vomiting (8.9 – 
13.3%) and diarrhoea (10.7%, no ADR active controlled study). This type of events was also frequently 
reported for cinacalcet (nausea: 22.6%, vomiting 13.8%). Overall, the type of adverse events included in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC is supported.  
Hyperkalaemia is frequently seen in patients with CKD and included as an ADR; frequencies were somewhat 
higher than placebo (4.4% etelcalcetide vs 3.1% placebo), but numerically lower than for cinacalcet (3.8% 
etelcalcetide vs 5.3% cinacalcet). Chronic oversuppression of PTH may result in adynamic bone disease. No 
cases of adynamic bone disease were identified which may be explained by the relatively short term follow-
up and the lack of bone biopsies. A warning is included in section 4.4 including recommendations for 
treatment and fractures (a consequence of adynamic bone disease)  is included as a potential risk in the 
RMP.  
Fractures could be the result of increased bone turnover activity and defective mineralization due to 
increased levels of PTH. Currently, the fracture rate was lower in the etelcalcetide compared to placebo 
(1.6% etelcalcetide vs 2.9% placebo) and similar to cinacalcet (2.1% etelcalcetide vs 2.6% cinacalcet). From 
a safety perspective, these data are reassuring although the follow-up period is limited.  
The interaction potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions for etelcalcetide is low due the lack of 
interaction with CYP450 enzymes. This may be a benefit over cinacalcet for which drug-drug interactions 
have been included in the SmPC. Of most relevance for etelcalcetide are the pharmacodynamics interactions 
with other drugs that could lower serum calcium levels and this is clearly stated in section 4.5 of the SmPC. A 
specific warning on concurrent administration with cinacalcet is justified based on the additive effect on CaSR 
signalling seen in cell-based assays. This has also been included as a potential risk in the RMP, which is 
endorsed. 
The safety profile appears comparable for the subgroups studied including gender, age, race and geographic 
region. Paediatric patients are currently not included in the intended target population. Patients with hepatic 
impairment were excluded. This information is currently included in section 5.2 of the SmPC. The safety data 
do not indicate any worse effect on the liver, therefore specific warnings related to this are not required. 
Antibodies to etelcalcetide were observed in about 11% of patients of which most already had pre-existing 
antibodies. No impact on the safety profile was seen for hypersensitivity and infusion reactions. Overall, 
these type of reactions were limited and not considered to be attributed to etelcalcetide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016

Medication adherence is not an issue as etelcalcetide is an intravenous product given with the haemodialysis 
and will therefore be controlled by dialysis unit staff.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of etelcalcetide is mainly characterised by events related to its primary mechanism of 
action as a calcimimetic and the majority of the reported events were of mild to moderate nature. The overall 
safety profile is approximately similar to cinacalcet. The most important risk of etelcalcetide is hypocalcaemia 
and associated events that can occur secondary to reductions in serum calcium (ie, QTc prolongation, 
ventricular arrhythmia, convulsions, and worsening heart failure). Hypocalcaemia and reduced calcium levels 
occurred slightly more with etelcalcetide than with cinacalcet, possibly also due to a more potent titration 
scheme for etelcalcetide. However, the dialysis population visits a dialysis unit three times a week with 
regular monitoring by specialized staff which could cover this. Specific guidance in the SmPC allows to 
prevent and manage the risks. Follow-up through routine pharmacovigilance activities seems sufficient.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Parsabiv (etelcalcetide) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Secondary HPT is a disorder characterized by parathyroid gland hyperplasia and increased concentrations of 
circulating PTH. The disease is seen most commonly in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
etelcalcetide is an allosteric activator of the CaSR, binding directly to the extracellular domain and activating 
the receptor at a site which is distinct from the calcium activating site. This is assumed to increase the 
sensitivity of the CaSR to calcium, thereby reducing the overexpression of PTH and its levels in circulation.

Beneficial effects 
The  demonstration  of  efficacy  of  etelcalcetide  for  the  treatment  of  secondary  HPT  in  patients  with  chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) on haemodialysis is primarily based on 2 pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled 26-
week  studies,  20120229  and  20120230.  The  studies,  identical  in  design,  enrolled  508  and  515  patients, 
respectively.  Efficacy  was  evaluated  during  the  efficacy  assessment  period  (EAP;  weeks  20  to  27).  The 
primary  endpoint  of  each  study  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  >  30%  reduction  from  baseline  in 
predialysis PTH during the EAP. 
In  addition,  a  phase  3,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  26-week  study  (20120360)  compared  etelcalcetide 
and cinacalcet in subjects with secondary HPT receiving haemodialysis; the study enrolled 683 patients. The 
primary  endpoint  was  the  same  as  for  the  placebo-controlled  studies  but  was  analysed  for  non-inferiority 
(primary) or superiority (secondary) of etelcalcetide compared to cinacalcet. 
Etelcalcetide treatment (3 times a week i.v. infusion after dialysis according to a flexible titration schedule 
starting at 5 mg) in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) for 26 weeks showed a 
significantly greater proportion of patients with a reduction of the PTH by > 30% after 20-27 weeks  over 
placebo. This effect was seen in two placebo controlled phase 3 studies (380 subjects [74.7%] vs. 46 
subjects [8.9%], respectively, p<0.001; mean baseline PTH level of approximately 840 pg/ml). Furthermore, 
etelcalcetide was non-inferior to cinacalcet using the same primary endpoint (proportion patients > 30% 
reduction PTH) showing a treatment difference of -10.48% (-17.45%, -3.51%) with the upper bound of the 
2-sided 95% (-3.51%) being substantially lower than the prespecified lower margin to demonstrate 
noninferiority (12%). Subsequent secondary analyses of proportion of patients with PTH reduction by > 50% 
and > 30% demonstrated etelcalcetide to be statistically significantly superior to cinacalcet when compared 
in the context of the titration algorithm chosen in the study. In the placebo controlled studies, significantly 
more subjects reached ≤ 300 pg/mL in PTH of approximately 50% during the evaluation period of 26 weeks 
(262 subjects [51.5%]) vs 25 subjects [4.9%], respectively, p<0.001). 
Additionally, significantly larger reductions in cCa were observed as well as reduction in phosphorus in the 
placebo controlled studies, with the cCa x P product also being reduced.  
The effect was maintained during 78 weeks open-label phase 3 extension (384 patients received etelcalcetide 
during both parent and extension studies; at least 75 at week 84) and 116 weeks open-label phase 2 
extension (30 patients received etelcalcetide in both parent and extension studies; 7 at week 116), although 
the difference in PTH levels diminished over time and patient numbers were very limited at the last time 
points. 
Clear guidance was applied for concomitant therapy during screening for calcium supplementation, vitamin D 
sterols, and phosphate binders, while for nutritional vitamin D no restrictions were applied in the comparator 
phase 3 study. During the study, for the most important concomitant therapy options (phosphate binders and 
vitamin D sterols) strict rules applied, which is considered necessary as these may interfere with the study 
outcome.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The data indicate that after each titration step more patients reached a >30% reduction in PTH, likely to be 
related to the relative faster titration scheme used for etelcalcetide (5 mg general starting dose up to 15 mg 
maximum dose with allowed incremental steps of 2.5-5 mg at 4-weekly intervals) compared to cinacalcet (30 
mg starting dose up to 180 maximum dose with allowed incremental steps of 30 mg or 60 mg [ie, from 120 
mg to 180 mg]  at 4-weekly intervals). A considerable proportion of patients needed to be titrated to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 88/98 
  
  
highest dose of 15 mg to reach this endpoint (18-23%). Also, the data indicate that, though this did not 
compromise the efficacy results, there was a slightly higher proportion of temporary dose interruptions with 
etelcalcetide (23%) compared to cinacalcet (19%), a slightly higher proportion of patients with dose 
increases of vitamin D sterols and/or calcium-containing phosphate binder or calcium supplement during dose 
suspensions. A slightly higher proportion of etelcalcetide patients needed down-titrations (6.3% vs 1.2% for 
cinacalcet at week 5; 16.6% vs 11.4% at week 17) but the treatment effect at every titration week was in 
favour of etelcalcetide when compared with cinacalcet. Therefore, down-titration appears not to affect the 
efficacy of etelcalcetide. 
Regular PTH monitoring over time is considered mandatory as a continuous stable dose appears not to be 
reached in a relevant proportion of patients. Recommendations regarding dose adaptations in response to 
PTH levels < 100 pg/ml and re-initiation dose administrations have been included in the SmPC.  
PTH values remained 40% reduced compared to baseline during the withdrawal phase of etelcalcetide after 
the placebo controlled phase 3 studies (week 27-31). A likely explanation could be that the withdrawal 
follow-up of 30 days could have been too short for several individuals due to several possible reasons, e.g. 
persistent drug effect of etelcalcetide, vitamin D sterol and calcium supplement use during the washout 
period, changes in calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) expression and increased sensitivity to serum calcium 
after etelcalcetide treatment, changes in bone remodelling during etelcalcetide treatment, and/or secondary 
hyperparathyroidism (HPT) disease heterogeneity. 
While also numerically lower levels of cCa and phosphorus were found with etelcalcetide in the comparator 
study, no statistical substantiation was possible because the third secondary endpoint (the number of days 
vomiting and nausea per week during the first 8 weeks) was not found to be superior for etelcalcetide in 
comparison to cinacalcet. Also, vomiting and nausea as investigated separately did not show superiority for 
etelcalcetide. In addition, the number of days vomiting and nausea per week over time was somewhat higher 
for etelcalcetide in comparison to cinacalcet for most of the time points investigated.  
Numerically greater reductions could be observed for bone markers of bone specific alkaline phosphatase 
(BSAP) and Type I collagen C-telopeptide (CTX) at week 27 in the etelcalcetide group both in comparison to 
placebo and to cinacalcet, although substantial variability is noticed. With the uncertainty noticed, this may 
indicate a positive effect on bone turnover. Similarly, for fibroblast growth factor-23, involved in regulation of 
phosphate concentration, a numerical decrease could be observed. 
A positive effect on the primary endpoint of >30% reduction from baseline in PTH and on the secondary 
endpoint of proportion of subjects with PTH ≤ 300 pg/mL could be observed for relevant subgroups in the 
combined placebo controlled studies and in the active-controlled study. Although some differences in 
treatment effect are suggested in some subgroups in the placebo controlled studies, these may be due to 
chance finding or could be reasonably explained, e.g. for baseline vitamin D sterol use;  more efficacy in 
patients without baseline vitamin D sterol use). The small size of most of these subgroups and the high 
variability that was observed generally do not allow for conclusions to be drawn. 
Although the PK profile and the consequential effect on PTH levels are different for etelcalcetide and 
cinacalcet, the assessment of the level of PTH just before dialysis is an appropriate timing to measure efficacy 
(lowest levels of etelcalcetide) and is considered not to favour etelcalcetide.

Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile was dominated by events related to etelcalcetides primary and secondary 
mechanisms of action of lowering PTH levels and calcium levels. Despite that patients were to be closely 
monitored during the titration and remaining phase of the study and should not be treated when serum 
calcium levels were below the lower limit of the normal range, the most frequently reported adverse event 
was asymptomatic decreased blood calcium (63.8% etelcalcetide vs 10.1% placebo and 68.9% etelcalcetide 
vs 59.8% cinacalcet). Furthermore, symptomatic events of hypocalcaemia were reported in 7.0% (placebo-
controlled studies) and 5.0% (active controlled study) of patients and more often for etelcalcetide than for 
cinacalcet (2.3%). These events of decreased calcium levels were mild to moderate in severity, transient 
(median recovery 2.1- to 2.9 weeks), and rarely resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug (n=5 
placebo-controlled studies). Phosphate reductions were also related to the reduction of PTH. 
Hypophosphatemia was also higher for etelcalcetide than for cinacalcet, likely due to the stronger PTH 
decreasing effect and titration scheme (1.5% etelcalcetide versus 0.9% cinacalcet).  
A higher incidence of QT prolongation has been observed with etelcalcetide in comparison to placebo (> 500 
msec 4.8% etelcalcetide vs 1.9% placebo). The risk for QT prolongation is thought to be associated with 
reductions of serum calcium and has been identified in the cinacalcet dossier as well. No data are available in 
comparison to cinacalcet as this was not investigated. In vitro evaluation on  hERG channels and preclinical 
safety pharmacology data in dogs showed that the QTc prolongation was associated with calcium levels and 
not directly with the drug. Moreover, an analysis on the phase 3 data, adjusting for the calcium effect, did 
not identify any direct QT prolonging effect of etelcalcetide. Yet, QT prolongation has been included as an 
ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC because of the increased frequency with etelcalcetide. 
Besides effects associated with PTH reduction, gastrointestinal adverse events were also frequently reported. 
Adverse events considered potentially related to etelcalcetide were nausea (10.7-18.3%), vomiting (8.9 – 
13.3%) and diarrhoea (10.7%, no ADR active controlled study). This type of events was also frequently 
reported for cinacalcet (nausea: 22.6%, vomiting 13.8%). It was suggested that the i.v. formulation as 
compared to the orally administered cinacalcet might mitigate these treatment-related AEs by bypassing the 
intestinal tract. However, no benefit of etelcalcetide was seen over cinacalcet as regards nausea and 
vomiting. 
The frequency of premature discontinuations due to adverse events were limited in etelcalcetide-treated 
patients (1.8% in placebo-controlled studies and 5.6% in the active controlled study). 
Hyperkalaemia is frequently seen in patients with CKD and included as an ADR; frequencies were somewhat 
higher than for placebo (4.4% etelcalcetide vs 3.1% placebo), but numerically lower than for cinacalcet 
(3.8% etelcalcetide vs 5.3% cinacalcet). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
About 23-36% of patients on etelcalcetide temporarily discontinued treatment due to low serum calcium 
levels, whereas down-titrations were also needed in a large proportion of patients who temporarily 
discontinued, with a slightly higher frequency for etelcalcetide than for cinacalcet. This difference is also likely 
to be associated with the relative faster titration scheme of etelcalcetide. However, efficacy was still improved 
compared to cinacalcet.  Additional information on treatment discontinuation did not reveal additional safety 
concerns.

In addition, potential adverse events associated with low calcium levels were further explored. Higher 
incidences of AEs of cardiac failure (3.2% etelcalcetide; 2.5% placebo and 3.0% etelcalcetide versus 0.6% 
cinacalcet) and independently adjudicated events of congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization (2.2% 
etelcalcetide versus 1.2% placebo) have been reported for etelcalcetide and are of potential concern, 
although the number of events is limited which does not allow to draw firm conclusions. Whether a causal 
relationship exists is difficult to ascertain given possible confounding by comorbidities commonly seen in 
haemodialysis patients, although they appear not to be related to the setting of hypocalcaemia. As vulnerable 
patient groups were excluded from the studies (history of certain cardiac disorders in the past 6 months such 
as myocardial infarction, CHF III or IV, ventricular arrhythmia), incidences might be higher in real practice, 
as a CKD patient population on haemodialysis is known to be at risk for cardiovascular comorbidity, and 
therefore the external validity of these studies may be somewhat compromised. However, the incidence of 
cardiac failure events appears similar to that observed in both placebo and cinacalcet groups during the first 
6 months of the EVOLVE study. Yet, the applicant has included a warning statement on the risk of worsening 
heart failure in section 4.4 of SmPC and included it as a potential risk in the RMP, which is supported.  
Events possibly associated with QT prolongation such as ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, convulsions, and 
sudden deaths were very limited and not different between treatment groups.  However, an absence of 
adverse events potentially associated with QTc prolongation does not allow for any firm conclusions, as these 
events are generally sparse and thus the potential to find any difference is low. The applicant has now 
included warnings on the risk of ventricular arrhythmia, and QT prolongations in section 4.4 of SmPC and 
included these as identified risks (QT prolongations) or potential risks (ventricular arrhythmia) in the RMP. 
This is considered acceptable. A warning on convulsions is included in section 4.4 and identified as potential 
risks in the RMP which is considered appropriate. 
The safety profile appears comparable for the subgroups studied including gender, age, race and geographic 
region.  
The interaction potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions for etelcalcetide is low due the lack of 
interaction with CYP450 enzymes. This may be a benefit over cinacalcet for which drug-drug interactions 
have been included in the SmPC. Of most relevance for etelcalcetide are the pharmacodynamics interactions 
with other drugs that could lower serum calcium levels and this is clearly stated in section 4.5 of the SmPC. A 
specific warning on concurrent administration with cinacalcet is justified based on the additive effect on 
lowering PTH levels seen in preclinical studies with a potential increased risk of hypocalcaemia. This has also 
been included as a potential risk in the RMP, which is endorsed. 
Fractures can also be the result of increased levels of PTH which results in increased bone turnover activity 
and defective mineralization. Currently, the fracture rate was lower in the etelcalcetide compared to placebo 
(1.6% etelcalcetide vs 2.9% placebo) and similar to cinacalcet (2.1% AMG 416 vs 2.6% cinacalcet). From a 
safety perspective, these data are reassuring although the follow-up period is limited.  
Chronic oversuppression of PTH may result in adynamic bone disease. No cases of adynamic bone disease 
were identified which may be explained by the relatively short term follow-up and the lack of bone biopsies. A 
warning is included in section 4.4 including recommendations for treatment and adynamic bone disease is 
included as a potential risk in the RMP.

Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The European Renal Association – European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) registry reported 
over 450,000 patients with ESRD who were receiving renal replacement therapy with most patients receiving 
dialysis (Pippias et al, 2015). Secondary HPT is common and a major burden in this population.  
Treatment with etelcalcetide is indicated for patients with chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis therapy 
with secondary HPT. These patients have extreme high levels of PTH thought to be associated with metabolic 
disturbances in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis including pathological changes in bone turnover. In 
addition, negative effects are anticipated on vascular calcification, left ventricular hypertrophy, and the risk of 
cardiovascular events. 
Etelcalcetide given on top of existing therapies such as phosphate binders and vitamin D sterols 
demonstrated a clear significant reduction of elevated levels of PTH compared to placebo. In a comparison 
study to cinacalcet, lower PTH levels were observed with etelcalcetide with the chosen titration scheme and 
point in time of evaluation of efficacy. Normalisation of extreme levels of PTH is considered to have positive 
effects on bone turnover, in particular when the levels of calcium and phosphorus are also reduced (as 
expressed in calcium x P product). These were also numerically reduced with etelcalcetide treatment. 
Reductions in some bone markers were shown in exploratory analyses. Although no efficacy assessment on 
clinical relevant endpoints of bone fractures has been performed, within the safety analyses a lower number 
of fractures was found for etelcalcetide in comparison to placebo, comparable to cinacalcet. However, number 
of events were limited and do not allow to draw conclusions.   
Too low levels of calcium, secondary to aggressive PTH reduction, could compromise treatment of lowering 
PTH for the individual patient, as this may be associated with specific safety issues. Decreases in serum 
calcium occurred frequently (64-69%) and slightly more than with cinacalcet, while in 23-36% of the patients 
treatment had to be discontinued temporarily to normalise calcium levels and a substantial proportion of 
these patients were down-titrated, likely also to be associated with a relative faster titration scheme for 
etelcalcetide. In terms of treatment management this did not mitigate the improved effect on PTH over time 
in comparison to cinacalcet. Permanent discontinuations were sparse. Safety issues related to low calcium 
levels of neuromuscular irritability were observed more frequently with etelcalcetide than placebo. Also, 
adverse events of cardiac repolarisation, in particular QT prolongation, were observed as expected due to 
lower calcium levels. However, any potential harmful effects in associated adverse events of ventricular 
arrhythmias, syncope, convulsions, and sudden deaths were very sparse, and did not allow for any final 
conclusions. A slightly higher incidence of cardiac failure with etelcalcetide treatment, which is an identified 
risk with cinacalcet, was found, but no conclusions could be drawn due to limited numbers and the potential 
presence of unidentified and confounding factors. In this respect, exclusion of vulnerable patient groups 
(history of certain cardiac disorders in the past 6 months such as myocardial infarction, CHF III or IV,

EMA/664198/2016

ventricular arrhythmia) from these studies, limits extrapolation of these findings to daily clinical practice. 
Also, data on death can be considered inconclusive due to low numbers and confounding potential, but did 
not raise further concerns.  
The long term studies provided data indicating maintenance of effect and safety, which is considered 
important for a treatment intended for a long period of time. 
An absence of interactions may be considered to favour etelcalcetide treatment in comparison to cinacalcet. 
Also i.v. injection of etelcalcetide which can be performed during dialysis may potentially improve adherence 
in comparison to the oral use of cinacalcet that may lead to gastrointestinal complaints and poor compliance. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Reaching  the  treatment  goals  of  secondary  HPT  management  in  CKD  patients  on  haemodialysis,  i.e. 
maintenance of PTH levels within a target range, avoidance of hyperphosphatemia and maintaining calcium in 
the normal range, is challenging, and sufficient control of these parameters is often not achieved. Particularly 
in patients with persistently high PTH values and high Ca levels the dose of Vitamin D sterols can often not be 
further  increased.  Cinacalcet  is  currently  registered  to  be  used  alone  or  as  add-on  to  standard  therapy 
including phosphate binders, vitamin D analogues or both.  
Etelcalcetide demonstrates a consistent and substantial effect on PTH compared to current standard therapy 
including phosphate binders and vitamin D sterols. Furthermore, a significant increased effect on PTH 
reduction compared to cinacalcet was observed with the chosen titration scheme. A decrease in calcium, 
related to the mechanism of action was also found slightly more frequently than with cinacalcet, indicating a 
slightly more forceful treatment management with etelcalcetide. Although this potentially compromises 
efficacy, this can be considered manageable with temporarily discontinuation of treatment.  
Further, adverse events related to low calcium levels and also other safety issues were observed infrequently 
and the safety profile is considered acceptable. Etelcalcetide as an i.v. administered product is well tolerated, 
which is important for long term therapy.  
Compared  with  the  approved  oral  calcimimetic  agent  Mimpara  (cinacalcet),  the  absence  of  interaction 
potential  of  etelcalcetide  due  to  lack  of  metabolism  via  CYP  enzymes  and  bypassing  of  the  gastrointestinal 
tract may be regarded as an advantage. 
Reduction  of  the  pill-burden  by  using  an  i.v.  drug  may  be  of  relevance  for  patients  who  already  take many 
drugs; this also impacts on treatment compliance. Patients receive etelcalcetide within dialysis sessions under 
supervision  of  medical  staff  which  may  be  also  an  advantage  as  regards  safety  monitoring.  However,  no 
substantial differences in AEs were seen in comparison to cinacalcet. 
It was suggested that the i.v. formulation (as compared to the orally administered cinacalcet) might mitigate 
the  treatment-related  AEs  of  nausea  and  vomiting  by  bypassing  the  intestinal  tract.  However,  etelcalcetide 
was not different from cinacalcet in the mean number of days of vomiting or nausea per week in the first 8 
weeks of treatment. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Reductions of PTH levels due to etelcalcetide treatment on top of existing therapy of phosphate binders and 
vitamin D sterols were found in two placebo controlled studies, and as a consequence, secondary reductions

Page 95/98 
  
  
of calcium and phosphorus were also observed. Importantly, a comparison has also been made to the 
calcimimetic cinacalcet. Cinacalcet has been approved based on its ability to reduce PTH in similar patients as 
now studied with etelcalcetide and is currently used in clinical practice. The clinical use of cinacalcet is 
currently mainly limited to postpone or avoid the need of parathyreoidectomy in patients with reduced life 
expectancy and patients awaiting kidney transplantation.  It was demonstrated that etelcalcetide showed a 
significantly increased effect on PTH reduction in comparison to cinacalcet taking into account the chosen 
titration scheme and time period of efficacy assessment. This was supported by a (not formally statistically 
tested) numerical reduction in calcium and phosphorus and exploratory endpoints of bone markers. However, 
the relative faster titration scheme resulted in a slightly higher need for dose interruptions and 
downtitrations. This and concomitant treatment adjustments during these interruptions did not substantially 
influence the observed increased reduction of PTH for etelcalcetide versus cinacalcet and are considered 
manageable with the current SmPC recommendations. Although it does not become completely absent, the 
need for dose changes reduces over time. Furthermore, no apparent safety issues were associated with these 
dose interruptions.  
Further, in the placebo controlled studies approximately half of the patients reached a treatment target of < 
300 pg/mL in PTH after 6 months of treatment. However, the clinical relevance of such a target PTH level is 
not established. In the BONAFIDE study that was performed post-approval with cinacalcet, a level of less 
than 300 pg/mL was associated with decreases in markers of bone turnover and improved bone histology. 
Such numerical reductions in bone markers for high bone turnover have also been observed in the present 
etelcalcetide studies. However, the clinical implications of these findings for the long term remain unclear.  
There is currently no specific recommendation for a target PTH level due to a lack of robust evidence for the 
association between PTH level and risk for mortality, CV death, and fractures. Also, any RCTs showing 
achievement of specific PTH levels resulting in improved outcome are lacking. The KDIGO 2009 guideline 
currently recommends to target PTH levels below 2 to 9 times above the upper limit of the normal range. The 
best evidence of any clinical implications of PTH reduction comes from the post-approval EVOLVE study with 
cinacalcet. This study did not meet its clinical primary CV endpoint (time to all-cause mortality, myocardial 
infarction, hospitalisation for unstable angina, heart failure or a peripheral vascular event), although 
secondary and additional sensitivity analyses suggested a beneficial effect. Diverging expert opinions exist in 
the field whether or not the study should be regarded as positive. Also, the secondary endpoint evaluating 
effects on bone in terms of fracture risk (which could be considered the most important clinical effect of 
reducing PTH) was not found to be significantly reduced. The study was, however, hampered by high dropout 
rates in both treatment groups and patients in the placebo arm who were prescribed cinacalcet as a 
component of their regular treatment.  
Therefore, any conclusions for the clinical implications of etelcalcetide treatment in reduction of PTH levels 
remain difficult to draw. The current dossier complies with current treatment practice and guidelines of 
reduction of extreme levels of PTH, which also acknowledge the limitations of this approach. It should be 
considered that such data have not been requested pre-or post approval for cinacalcet either.  Taking this 
into account it is not considered necessary to ask for long term outcome data of etelcalcetide. 
The safety profile identified is as expected for calcimimetics and comparable to what has been found for 
cinacalcet, except that due to the relative larger PTH lowering (dose) effect with etelcalcetide slightly more 
patients showed decreases in their calcium levels. This can be considered as one of the reasons for the 
slightly higher frequencies of dose interruptions and down-titrations with etelcalcetide compared to 
cinacalcet.    
Assessment report  
EMA/664198/2016 
Page 96/98 
  
  
Adverse events that could be associated with a reduction of serum calcium levels did not show any 
differences between etelcalcetide and cinacalcet with respect to the frequency of treatment discontinuation 
due to AEs as this was sparsely observed. Somewhat more adverse events related to hypocalcaemia were 
found with etelcalcetide as compared to cinacalcet, in particular in relation to neuromuscular irritability. 
However, events related to cardiac repolarisation, which could potentially be harmful were infrequent in the 
current dossier. This is in itself reassuring but also limits estimation of this risk, also in comparison to 
cinacalcet. In this respect, exclusion of certain vulnerable patients with CV disease during these studies 
somewhat limits extrapolation of these findings to daily clinical practice, knowing that CKD patient frequently 
have (a history of) CV disease. Therefore, these potential risks have been included in the RMP and several 
warning statements have been included in the SmPC which is acceptable. 
A  potential  serious  risk  of  treatment  with  etelcalcetide  is  prolonged  suppression  of  PTH  levels  below 
100pg/mL, which is known to be associated with adynamic bone disease. No cases of adynamic bone disease 
were seen in the pivotal studies so far, but follow up may be too short yet. 
Overall, the benefits of etelcalcetide in the treatment of secondary HPT in CKD patients are considered to 
outweigh the risks.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Flucelvax Tetra in the approved indication remains 
favourable and therefore recommended the renewal of the 
marketing authorisation with unlimited validity.

As a possible relationship between GBS and Flucelvax Tetra 
Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) to the list of adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) based on the assessment of 
the global safety database. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to carry out minor updates to the 
Package Leaflet to fully align it with the information 
in the SmPC. 
cannot be excluded, and there is at least a reasonable 
possibility to consider a causal association between GBS 
and Flucelvax Tetra, Section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated 
to include Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) to the list of 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs), with frequency ‘not known’.

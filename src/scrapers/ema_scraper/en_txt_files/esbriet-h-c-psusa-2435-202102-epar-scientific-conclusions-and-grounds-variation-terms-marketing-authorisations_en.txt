Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pirfenidone, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In  view  of  the  available  data  on  from  post-marketing  reports  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal  relationship 
between Stevens Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis and pirfenidone is considered at least 
a  reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products  containing 
pirfenidone should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pirfenidone the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pirfenidone is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

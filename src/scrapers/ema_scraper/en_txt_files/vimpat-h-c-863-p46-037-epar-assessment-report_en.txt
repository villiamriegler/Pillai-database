1.  Introduction 
In the EU, lacosamide (LCM) is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of 
partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 
4 years of age with epilepsy.  
Lacosamide (R-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide; previously referred to as harkoseride) 
is a functionalised amino acid. The precise mechanism of its antiepileptic effects in humans is not fully 
elucidated, but in vitro electrophysiological studies have indicated a selective enhancement of slow 
inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels with ensuing stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal 
membranes. 
On 5th of December, 2019, the MAH submitted an Article 46 paediatric dossier for study SP0060, which 
was completed on 28th of June   2019, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, 
as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

Description 
Phase 2/3, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of i.v. LCM infusions in 
pediatric study participants ≥1 month to <17 years of age with epilepsy, and in addition, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) data regarding the use of  the i.v. LCM formulation either as replacement for oral 
LCM or for adjunctive LCM treatment initiation. No efficacy data were collected. 
Methods 
Objective 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of i.v. LCM infusion(s) in 
paediatric study participants ≥1 month to <17 years with epilepsy. Evaluation of the PK of i.v. LCM in 
paediatric patients was considered an additional objective. 
Study design 
As described above, EP0060 was a phase 2/3, multicenter, open-label safety and tolerability study to 
evaluate i.v. LCM infusions in pediatric study participants ≥1 month to <17 years of age with epilepsy. 
The study population of some 100 patients from approximately 30 sites was to consist of following 
patient groups eligible for the study: 
•  Open-label lacosamide (OLL) patients: patients receiving oral LCM as adjunctive or 
monotherapy as participants in an open-label long-term study (SP848, EP0034, or other 
pediatric study) upon EP0060 enrollment. 
• 
• 
Patients on prescribed lacosamide (RxL) (eg. VIMPAT) patients: patients who were receiving 
prescribed oral LCM from commercial supply (eg. VIMPAT) as adjunctive or monotherapy upon 
EP0060 enrollment. 
Initiating iv lacosamide (IIL) patients: patients who were not receiving LCM prior to EP0060 
enrollment and received iv LCM as adjunctive treatment in EP0060. LCM monotherapy was not 
permitted in IIL study participants. 
For all patients, the screening, baseline, treatment period, and the final visit occurred in 1 day, 
provided the patient only required 1 i.v. infusion, results of examinations were available to allow 
verification of eligibility prior to infusion, and the time permitted completion of final visit assessment. 
Should more time be necessary for screening assessments or to obtain results, the screening period 
could last up to 7 days. For OLL and RxL patients, oral LCM was administered during this time 
according to their open-label study or prescribed LCM dosage regimen, whereas IIL patients were not 
administered LCM during this period. If time did not permit completing the end-of-study/final visit 
assessments on the same day, it was conducted on the day following the last dose of iv LCM. The 
safety follow-up (SFU) telephone contact 1 occurred 1 to 3 days after the final visit for all study 
participants. 
EP0060 was to begin with Cohort 1 with completion of treatment of the first 20 patients, followed by a 
review of the safety and tolerability data by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) 
before further enrollment. IDMC review was performed similarly after completion of 20 patients in 
Cohort 2.

Study population /Sample size 
EP0060 was designed to include up to 2 age-based cohorts:  
•  Cohort 1 including a minimum of 40 patients who were ≥8 to <17 years of age, with at least 
20 patients being at least 12 years old and at least 20 patients in the age range ≤8 to <12. 
•  Cohort 2 including approximately 44 study participants who were ≥1 month to <8 years of 
age, with 20 patients in the age range ≥4 to <8 years, 12 patients in the range ≥2 to <4 
years, and 12 patients in the range ≥1 month to <2 years of age.  
Treatments 
At least 1 dose of i.v. LCM was administered during the treatment period. In case more than 1 infusion 
was given, they were administered twice daily (bid) at approximately 12-hour intervals for up to 10 
doses (or up to 5 days) according to the clinical need (e.g. undergoing surgery) or up to 2 consecutive 
doses (over approximately 24 hours) for elective administration (initiation of LCM treatment). For OLL 
and RxL patients, the daily dose of i.v. LCM equalled the patient’s current stable daily dose of oral LCM 
(2 to 12mg/kg/day or 100 to 600mg/day). The maximum dose permitted in this study for OLL and RxL 
study participants was 12mg/kg/day or 600mg/day, whichever was lower. For IIL study participants, 
the i.v. LCM dose was 1mg/kg bid (weight <50kg) or 50mg bid (weight ≥50kg). The total LCM daily 
dose for IIL patients was 2mg/kg/day (weight <50kg) or 100mg/day (weight ≥50kg) and remained 
constant for at least 7 days prior to an increase.  
For the first 20 patients in Cohort 1, i.v. LCM was to be infused over a duration of 30-60 minutes. After 
IDMC review and acceptance, the infusions could be given within 15-30 minutes if needed.

CHMP comment 
The study EP0600 was focused primarily on the safety and tolerability of intravenously administered 
LCM in paediatric population with epilepsy (mostly as add-on treatment). The design was staged with 
intervening safety monitoring and carried out in two age-based cohorts. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 103 patients (100%) started and completed the study, with 48 patients in Cohort 2 (≥1 
month to <8 years of age) and 55 patients in Cohort 1 (≥8 to <17 years of age). 
The patient subgroups are shown in the table below (Table 1): 
The majority of patients were in the IIL group (71.8% [n=74]), followed by the RxL group (25.2% 
[n=26]). The predominance of IIL group was more accentuated in Cohort 2 compared to Cohort 1 
(87.5% [n=42] vs. 58.2% [n=32]) whereas there were fewer patients in the RxL group (12.5% [n=6] 
vs. 36.4% [n=20]). The OLL study participants were all in Cohort 1 (5.5% [n=3]). 
Baseline data 
A summary of patient disposition and baseline characteristics is given in the table below (Table 2):

Table 3:  History of seizure characteristics in the patient cohorts 
Table 4:  Historical seizure types in the patient cohorts 
Actual duration of infusion ranged from 28 to 55 minutes in Cohort 2 and from 21 to 60 minutes in 
Cohort 1. Infusion times below 30 minutes were only evaluated in 4 study participants, including 2 
study participants below 4 years of age. 
The majority of patients (99.0% [n=102]) used a concomitant anti-epileptic drug (AED) during the 
treatment period. The most common concomitant AEDs by chemical subgroup were other antiepileptics

(63 patients [61.2%]), fatty acid derivatives (46 patients [44.7%]), and carboxamide derivatives (34 
patients [33.0%]). 
The use of AEDs by medication name was generally similar between cohorts, with the exception of 
valproic acid, used by a higher percentage of study participants in Cohort 2 (≥1 month to <8 years of 
age) compared with Cohort 1 (≥8 to <17 years of age), and levetiracetam and LCM, used by a lower 
percentage of study participants in Cohort 2 compared with Cohort 1. 
CHMP comment 
The subgrouping is strongly weighted towards lacosamide-naïve patients, especially in the Cohort 
2. In the baseline seizure characteristics, the partial-onset seizures dominate, in line with the 
presently approved indication of LCM, whereas 12 patients (11.7%) were reported to have had 
generalized seizures. The main infusion rate under scrutiny (in 96%) is within the range 30-60 
minutes. The concomitant antiepileptic medications were acceptable in combination, and the 
differences of concomitant AEDs between the cohorts are expected. 
Efficacy results 
N/A 
Safety results 
A total of 79 patients (76.7%) received 1 infusion, 20 patients (19.4%) received 2 infusions, 1 patient 
(1.0%) received 3 infusions, and 3 patients (2.9%) received 10 infusions. In Cohort 2 (≥1 month to <8 
years of age) compared with Cohort 1 (≥8 to <17 years of age), a lower proportion of study 
participants received 1 infusion (60.4% [n=29] compared with 90.9% [n=50]) and a higher proportion 
of study participants received 2 infusions (39.6% [n=19] compared with 1.8% [n=1]). All study 
participants that received 3 infusions or 10 infusions were in Cohort 1. 
Summary of TEAEs 
A summary of the incidence of TEAEs in participants <18 years of age is presented in the table below 
(Table 5).

Five patients (4.9%) reported a total of 7 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) following 
treatment with iv LCM, including 3 patients (6.3%, 4 TEAEs) in Cohort 2 (≥1 month to <8 years of 
age) and 2 patients  (3.6%, 3 TEAEs) in Cohort 1 (≥8 to <17 years of age). All of the TEAEs were 
nonserious. None of the TEAEs were considered related to study medication, led to discontinuation, led 
to permanent withdrawal of study medication, were severe, or led to death. Subgroup analysis of study 
participant groups (OLL and RxL, combined, and IIL) and target infusion duration (15 to 30 minutes, 
and 30 to 60 minutes) by cohort showed no meaningful trends. 
The only TEAEs by SOC that occurred in >1 patient were Infections and infestations and Investigations 
(2 patients [1.9%] each). Four patients reported AEs during oral intake of LCM; all but one of the AEs 
were considered not related to study medication, and the one (pyrexia) was considered treatment 
emergent. 
TEAEs of Interest 
No TEAEs of specific interest were reported (significant arrhythmias, syncopes or loss of consciousness, 
serious hypersensitivity reactions, worsening of epilepsy, or sign of significant hepatic injury).  
Vital sign measurements, ECG and laboratory findings 
Vital signs or 12-lead electrocardiographic observations yielded no consistent or clinically relevant 
changes from baseline. ECG changes deemed clinically not relevant were small for PR interval, QRS 
duration, QTcF, and QTcB changes with no evidence of QT, QTcB, or QTcF prolongation following LCM 
treatment, and no ECG-related TEAEs were reported.

No hematological TEAEs were reported. Treatment-emergent AEs of increased blood triglycerides were 
reported by 2 patients (1.9%) as well as increased blood cholesterol in one patient (1.0%), 
Investigations by SOC.  
The pharmacokinetic data display a high postdose variability. PK data is indicated by the MAH to be 
reported separately.  
CHMP comment 
The overall incidence of TEAEs, especially drug-related, appears low in this setting, and does not raise 
any new concerns about the intravenous administration in the paediatric population.  
The pharmacokinetic data shows variability, which may not be unexpected, but the pharmacological 
conclusion is missing. The separate population PK report is not provided with the dossier. In order to 
evaluate whether data on exposure in paediatric subjects below 4 years of age are relevant for section 
5.2, in accordance with the paediatric legislation, the population PK report should be submitted. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
A total of 103 patients ≥1 month and <17 years old were included in study EP0060, which constituted 
the total population under study. The open-label study was designed to probe safety and tolerability 
aspects of i.v. administered LCM, which was used either as a replacement for oral administration 
during a procedure or for adjunctive, elective treatment initiation. The clinical contexts prompting i.v. 
administration are not further discussed.  
A small minority of the patients reported TEAEs (5 subjects; 4.9 %). None of the events were serious 
or led to discontinuation of the medication. No such safety findings were reported that would fall 
outside the known safety profile of LCM or raise a safety concern. 
The safety profile of lacosamide in the paediatric population is currently reflected in the SmPC. No 
new safety concerns were identified, and consequently, there is no need to update the product 
information based on this dataset at present; however, in order to evaluate whether data on exposure 
in paediatric subjects below 4 years of age are relevant for section 5.2, in accordance with the 
paediatric legislation, the population PK report should be submitted, as well as a clarification of how 
the dose was determined in the study at hand. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH submitted the results of EP0060 in order to fulfil the requirement of reporting paediatric data 
as outlined in accordance with Article 46 of regulation (EC) no 1901/2006, as amended. The limited 
number and the character of the reported TEAEs in subjects ≤18 years of age does not raise new 
safety concerns. 
The MAH does not propose any changes of the currently approved SmPC based on the present data, 
which is supported.

  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1. The MAH is requested to provide the separate population pharmacokinetic report containing the 
clinical pharmacology conclusions. 
2. Since LCM is not licensed in children below 4 years of age, the MAH should clarify how the dose used 
in the age group ≥ 1 month to 4 years was determined. 
3. The i.v. LCM formulation was used in the study either as a replacement for oral administration or for 
adjunctive treatment initiation. The MAH is asked to briefly summarize the clinical contexts that are 
thought to raise the need for the use of i.v. LCM as an adjunctive treatment or as a replacement for 
oral use. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
1. The MAH have acknowledged the Agency’s comment and provided the following response. The prior 
LCM population PK model (CL0447 Part II, submitted in sequence LC0257) was extended with data 
from i.v. dosed paediatric study participants from EP0060 (CL0447 Part III). CL0447 Part II contained 
PK data from 9 orally dosed studies EP0008, SP754, SP755, SP847, SP1047, SP848, SP0969, SP0966, 
SP0982. The CL0447 Part III report was provided as requested. 
The modeling and simulation study aimed to update an existing population pharmacokinetic (PK) 
model of lacosamide (LCM), with intravenous (iv) administered data in paediatric study participants 
from EP0060 in order to assess the degree of similarity in exposure for the i.v. and oral routes of 
administration. Simulations of the proposed dosing schedule of 6 mg/kg bid for weight <30 kg, 4

mg/kg bid for weight ≥30 kg and weight <50 kg, and 200 mg bid for weight ≥50 kg [1, 2], resulted in 
paediatric exposures in line with adult exposures as illustrated below:  
Figure: Predicted LCM Css for a 6 mg/kg bid dose for weight <30kg, a 4 mg/kg bid dose for 30≤weight<50 kg, and 
a 200 mg bid dose for weight ≥50 kg vs. age (bottom row) and weight (top row) for children, using the final LCM 
population PK model (run107) Css: average steady state concentration. Red line and blue area: median and 90% of 
simulated LCM Css values for study participants <18 years sampled from the Nhanes database for oral dosing (left 
column) and iv dosing (right column). Red circles: individual predicted LCM Css values. Pink area: 90% of simulated 
LCM Css values for adult study participants after oral dosing in all graph panels.  
The oral dosing scheme was mostly positioned in the model-predicted range, which was interpreted as 
showing adequacy of the model predictions. The MAH concluded that the proposed dosing scheme 
results in uniform exposure across the investigated age and weight ranges in paediatric study 
participants, and oral dosing can be replaced with i.v. dosing without further dose-adaptation.

CHMP comment 
The population PK report has been submitted with its conclusions. The supplementary information may 
be considered sufficient and the conclusion acceptable. The average steady state concentrations given 
the i.v. administration are largely similar to the concentration range given the oral administration for 
all body weights and ages. Hence no update of the SmPC is warranted. Issue resolved. 
2. Since LCM licensing does not cover children less than 4 years of age, the MAH was asked to clarify 
how the dosing was determined in the age group ≥ 1 month to 4 years. The MAH responded as 
follows: 
Acknowledging the Rapporteur’s question, the rationale below is provided for dose selection:  
i) A weight-based LCM dosing scheme for paediatric subjects has been or is being evaluated in Phase 3 
double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies and targets similar LCM plasma concentrations as those 
observed in adults given 400mg/day. As such, the target doses of LCM for the Phase 3 studies are 8 to 
12mg/kg/day; however, subjects entering EP0060 can be on a wider range of LCM doses based on the 
ranges of doses allowed in the long-term, open-label studies (2 to 12mg/kg/day or 100to 600mg/day). 
Thus, the i.v. LCM doses being evaluated in EP0060 will range from 2 to 12mg/kg/day or 100 to 
600mg/day for open-label lacosamide (OLL) and prescribed lacosamide (RxL) subjects, with a 
maximum dose of 12mg/kg/day or 600mg/day, whichever is lower. For initiating intravenous 
lacosamide (IIL) subjects, this range of doses above also includes the paediatric starting dose of 
2mg/kg/day (subjects <50kg) or 100mg/day (subjects ≥50kg), which is the same as those used in the 
Phase 3 paediatric LCM studies. The LCM dose at initiation of treatment should remain constant for at 
least 7 days prior to a LCM dose increase. The applied doses were derived from CL0177 report 
(submitted within sequence LC0186) and related publication (provided in Module 5.4), studied in 
EP0060 and confirmed in CL0447 part III report (provided in Module 5.3.3.5).  
ii) The modeling and simulation study CL0447 part III aimed to update an existing population 
pharmacokinetic (PK) model of lacosamide (LCM), with intravenous (iv) administered data in paediatric 
study participants from EP0060, with the intent to assess the degree of similarity in exposure for the iv 
and oral route of administration. These results suggest that the proposed dosing schedule of 6 mg/kg 
dosed twice daily (bid) for weight <30 kg, 4 mg/kg bid for weight ≥30 kg and weight <50 kg, and 200 
mg bid for weight ≥50 kg, results in uniform exposures across the investigated age and weight ranges 
in paediatric study participants, and oral dosing can be replaced with iv dosing without further dose-
adaptation. 
iii) The dose used in the age group ≥ 1 month to 4 years was also based on UCB Phase 3 study SP0967 
(for paediatric patients from ≥ 1 month to 4 years of age). Using the same mg-per-mg intravenous 
dose as by the oral route when patients switch from oral to IV and back is justified by the complete 
bioavailability (F) of lacosamide (Foral:100%). The intravenous dosing regimen is also supported by 
prior paediatric intravenous PK modeling and simulation (CL0266 report submitted within sequence 
LC0186). 
iv) Furthermore, EP0060 was designed to include up to 2 age-based cohorts with Cohort 1 including at 
least 40 study participants who were ≥8 to <17 years and Cohort 2 including approximately 44 study 
participants who were ≥1 month to <8 years. Within Cohort 1, at least 20 study participants were to be 
≥12 to <17 years of age and at least 20 study participants were to be ≥8 to <12 years of age. Within

Cohort 2, every attempt was to be made to enroll 20 study participants ≥4 to <8 years of age, 12 
study participants ≥2 to <4years of age, and 12 study participants ≥1 month to <2 years of age. An 
IDMC reviewed the safety and tolerability data for each cohort to make the following 
recommendations: the progression of the Cohort 1, including iv infusion durations to be evaluated, and 
initiation of enrollment in the next cohort (Cohort 2). In conclusion and considering the above, UCB 
considered that sufficient data were available to apply this dose regimen in the age group ≥ 1 month to 
4 years. 
CHMP comment 
The rationale of dose determination in the youngest patient group has been acceptably clarified. 
3. As the i.v. LCM formulation was used in the study either as a replacement for oral administration or 
for adjunctive treatment initiation, the MAH was asked to briefly summarize the clinical contexts that 
are thought to raise the need for the use of i.v. LCM as an adjunctive treatment or as a replacement 
for oral use. 
In response, the MAH explained that intravenous formulations are particularly helpful as short-term 
replacement of oral formulations for patients unable to take oral products (e.g. preoperative and

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Dengvaxia in the approved indication remains favourable 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

increase of neutralizing Ab titers after the booster in 
dengue immune subjects. Why there is a lack of/limited 
booster effect with Dengvaxia remains not understood in 
terms of mechanisms and clinical implications. In the 
absence of immune correlates of protection, whether the 
absence or modest increases in Ab titers, plasmablasts, and 
memory B cells, do not translate or could translate in 
protection against dengue disease, during the first year 
post-boost or during a longer period, is not known. It was 
thus considered that the added value and timing for 
booster dose(s) have not been established.  
This paragraph was added to the Posology Section of the 
SmPC: 
“The added value of and appropriate timing for booster 
dose(s) have not been established. Current available data 
Page 3/10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are included in section 5.1.” 
Cross-referred to the following text in Section 5.1: 
“The effect of a booster dose was assessed in subjects 9-50 
years living in endemic areas after a 3-dose schedule 
(studies CYD63, CYD64, CYD65). No or modest transient 
increase of neutralizing Ab titers was observed after the 
boost. The booster effect was variable across serotypes and 
studies.  
Why there is a lack/limited booster effect with Dengvaxia 
remains not understood in terms of mechanisms and 
clinical implications.”

pertussis (Tdap) vaccine from CYD67, CYD71 and 
CYD66 final study reports respectively (final reports 
from three MEA studies listed as category 3 studies 
in the RMP); these studies are focused on 
immunogenicity and safety of the concomitant 
administration. The Package Leaflet is updated

conducted three co-administration studies with vaccines 
used in this age range: human papillomavirus (HPV) 
vaccines (studies CYD67 and CYD71, respectively) and 
tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine in study 
CYD66. 
These studies assessed the immunogenicity and safety 
following the concomitant administration, compared to 
sequential administration, of Dengvaxia with the other 
vaccines. The final clinical study reports for these co-
administration Phase III studies were submitted. The 
results support allowing concomitant administration of 
Dengvaxia with bivalent HPV, quadrivalent HPV, and Tdap 
vaccines. 
Section 4.5 of the Dengvaxia SmPC was updated to reflect 
the statistical limitation regarding the unmet non-inferiority 
criteria for the HPV vaccines and Dengvaxia in CYD67 and 
CYD71 studies. The results of these two studies are 
appropriately described in the SmPC, as well as those of

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Actinic keratosis (AK) is an ultraviolet-light-induced lesion of the skin that can remain unchanged, 
resolve without further treatment or may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. It is by far the 
most common lesion with malignant potential to arise on the skin. AK is mostly seen in fair-skinned 
persons on skin areas that have had long-term sun exposure (Salasche, 2000). Regions with higher 
ultraviolet exposure have a higher prevalence of AK. In Europe, a prevalence of 15% in men and 6% in 
women has been documented. Over the age of 70 years, 34% of men and 18% of women were found 
to have AK (Memon et al, 2000). Following topical application of ALA (5-aminolevulinic acid), the 
substance is metabolized to PpIX, a photoactive compound which accumulates intracellularly in the 
treated actinic keratosis lesions. PpIX is activated by illumination with red light of a suitable 
wavelength and energy. In the presence of oxygen, reactive oxygen species are formed. The latter 
causes damage to cellular components and eventually destroys the target cells. Red-light illumination 
was chosen since light with longer wave lengths penetrates deeper into the tissue. 
Treatment for AK is chosen based on several aspects such as age of the patient at diagnosis, previous 
occurrence of skin cancer, presence of the lesion(s), and the patient’s tolerability of the treatment. The 
treatment options consist of either surgical destruction for well-defined lesions of the skin, topical 
medicinal products and photodynamic therapy. Current medicinal products approved for AK include 5-
fluorouracil, imiquimod and ingenol mebutate. PDT requires 3 components: (1) a photosensitizer, (2) 
light with a sufficient amount of energy at a suitable spectrum of wavelengths, and (3) oxygen. In PDT 
light energy is transferred by the photosensitizer to oxygen, leading to the formation of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS). ROS oxidize cell membranes and other cellular compounds, causing necrosis or 
apoptosis of targeted cells. Ameluz (with 5-aminolevulinic acid as active ingredient) belongs to the 
pharmacological class of medications called “photodynamic therapy photosensitizers”.  
BF-200 ALA 10% (Ameluz) is a non-sterile, topical formulation of 10% 5-aminolevulinic acid 
hydrochloride in a gel-matrix with nanoemulsion. BF-200 ALA 10% contains 10% ALA as hydrochloride 
salt, equaling 7.8% of the free acid. BF-200 ALA 10% is used in combination with red light 
photodynamic therapy. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a delta-amino acid and occurs as an endogenous 
molecule of the heme biosynthesis pathway in almost every cell in humans, animals and plants. ALA 
functions as a pro-drug and is metabolized to the photoactive substance protoporphyrinIX (PpIX) in 
mitochondria. PpIX, a photoactive compound, accumulates intracellularly in the treated actinic 
keratosis lesions. PpIX is activated by illumination with red light of a suitable wavelength and energy. 
In the presence of oxygen, reactive oxygen species are formed. The latter cause damage of cellular 
components and eventually destroys the target cells. Many actinic keratoses do not appear solitarily 
but in an area exceeding 4 cm2 (field cancerization). Field cancerization describes areas including 
actinic keratosis lesions and chronically photo-damaged fields. Data from a new phase III trial (ALA-
AK-CT007) is provided to support the efficacy and safety of the treatment in patients with AK and field 
cancerisation. 
The MAH has applied for an extension of the indication as follows: 
Ameluz is indicated for treatment of actinic keratoses of mild to moderate intensity severity on the face 
and scalp (Olsen grade 1 to 2; see section 5.1) and of field cancerization. 
Assessment report  
EMA/630770/2016  
Page 6/55 
 
 
 
 
One session of photodynamic therapy should be administered for single or multiple lesions or entire 
fields with cancerization. Actinic keratosis lesions or fields should be evaluated three months after 
treatment. Treated lesions or fields that have not completely resolved after 3 months shall be 
retreated. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new relevant non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH did not submit an ERA. The extended indication is not expected to lead to a significant 
increase in environmental exposure further to the use of 5-aminolevulinic acid. Hence, the extension of 
the indication is not likely to pose a significant risk to the environment.  5-aminolevulinic acid should 
be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC in order to minimise any potential risks to the 
environment. Therefore, a standard disposal advice was updated in section 6.6 of the SmPC to add the 
following wording “Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in 
accordance with local requirements”. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The lack of non-clinical data to support the extension of the indication is acceptable as the condition 
and patient population is the same and the indication has not substantially changed. Therefore, no 
update to section 5.3 of the SmPC was proposed. The SmPC has been updated in section 6.6 
concerning the disposal of the product in accordance with local requirements. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The justification for not submitting an ERA in this application is acceptable as the data suggest that 
there will be no significant increase in environmental exposure to 5-aminolevulinic acid as the target 
population in the indication is the same as previously. Hence, 5-aminolevulinic acid is not expected to 
pose an increased risk to the environment. The lack of non-clinical studies is considered justified. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Study ALA-AK-CT006: A single center, non-randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled, fixed sequence 
Phase I study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in 12 patients with 
actinic keratosis following topical application of a gel formulation containing 78 mg/g ALA (Ameluz) 
under maximal use conditions when using photodynamic therapy.  
The primary objective of the study was to obtain baseline-adjusted plasma concentrations-time curves 
for ALA and its metabolic product protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) after a single treatment with ALA in 
patients with actinic keratosis under maximal use conditions. 
The secondary objectives of the study included: 
• 
• 
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters of ALA: AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax derived from baseline-
adjusted plasma concentrations (if data permitted). 
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters of ALA: tmax, t1/2, and λz derived from unadjusted 
plasma concentrations (if data permitted) because baseline-adjustment had no influence on these 
estimates. 
•  Assessment of safety and tolerability of ALA under maximal use conditions 
Patients were included with a confirmed actinic keratosis of mild to moderate intensity (Olson Grade 1 
and 2) between 18 and 85 years (inclusive) with at least 10 actinic keratosis lesions on face or 
forehead in a total topical treatment area of approximately 20 cm2 with a maximum of 2 illumination 
areas with each lesion being not more than 2 mm thick and having a side margin of at least 5 mm. 
ALA was applied topically as a film of approximately 1 mm thickness over the treatment area of 
approximately 20 cm². Each patient received a photodynamic therapy after application of placebo 
(Period 1) and after application of ALA (Period 2) with a washout period of 7 days. 
The primary endpoint was baseline-adjusted plasma concentrations of ALA and PpIX that were used for 
obtaining baseline corrected plasma concentrations-time curves. The secondary endpoints were 
baseline-adjusted AUC0-t, baseline-adjusted AUC0-∞, baseline-adjusted Cmax, tmax, t1/2, and λz of ALA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/630770/2016  
Page 9/55 
 
 
 
 
 
Further endpoints analysed were baseline-adjusted AUC0-t, baseline-adjusted AUC0-∞, baseline-
adjusted Cmax, tmax, t1/2, and λz of PpIX and the following pharmacokinetic characteristics were 
determined unadjusted Cmax and baseline-adjusted tmax of ALA and PpIX. Safety was assessed by 
evaluating physical examination, blood pressure and pulse rate, 12-lead electrocardiogram, local and 
overall tolerability, pain assessment, safety laboratory and adverse events. 
All patients showed ALA concentrations above LLOQ at all sampling time points. In most of the patients 
ALA was systemically absorbed, i.e., an obvious increase of ALA concentrations was observed after 
application of the ALA gel compared to baseline and the placebo gel. Maximum geometric mean ALA 
concentrations were reached at 3 h after application. There was low systemic absorption; the 
geometric mean of Cmax was about 2.5 times of the geometric mean of baseline concentrations 
(41.18 ng/mL vs 17.28 ng/mL). Baseline-adjusted maximum concentrations (Cmax) were 4.47 ng/ml 
(range 1.4 – 6.94 ng/ml) following placebo and 21.56 ng/ml (range 4.76 – 77.53 ng/ml) following 
Ameluz. Thereafter, ALA was eliminated quickly from plasma returning to approximate baseline levels 
within 10 h after application. Baseline-adjusted total (AUC0-t) and maximum (Cmax) exposure to ALA 
was increased after application of the ALA gel compared to the placebo gel. 
In one patient baseline concentrations of ALA were about 3-fold higher in Period 2 compared to Period 
1 (placebo gel). Descriptive statistics of plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of ALA 
excluding this patient showed similar results as compared to the analysis including this patient. There 
was only little systemic absorption, geometric mean of Cmax was about 2.5 times of the geometric 
mean of baseline concentrations (with and without the outlier patient). 
PpIX 
Concentrations of metabolite PpIX were generally low in all patients. Four patients showed 
concentrations BLLQ at all post-dose sampling time points. Most of the other patients showed 
concentrations BLLQ incidentally. In none of the patients, an obvious difference of PpIX concentrations 
was observed after application of the ALA gel compared to baseline and the placebo gel, i.e. 
metabolism of ALA to PpIX was not increased under maximal use conditions. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The study ALA-AK-CT006 is deemed adequate in terms of the overall study design, PK measures and 
the  patients  selected  patients.    ALA  was  systemically  absorbed,  i.e.,  baseline-adjusted  total  (AUC0-t) 
and  maximum  (Cmax)  exposure  to  ALA  was  increased  after  application  of  Ameluz  compared  to  the 
vehicle. Maximum concentrations were observed at 3 h after application and systemic absorption was 
low.  Thereafter,  ALA  was  eliminated  quickly  from  plasma  returning  to  approximate  baseline  levels 
within 10 h after application. In addition, concentrations of metabolite PpIX were also found to be low 
in  all  patients.  The  MAH  provided  literature  data  which  supported  the  overall  conclusions  (data  not 
shown). Hence, the SmPC section 5.2 has been updated with information that with the maximal use of 
Ameluz, plasma concentration of Ameluz was still within the normal range of reported endogenous ALA 
concentrations. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There is no relevant increase to the plasma concentration of either ALA or PpIX when the product is 
used at maximal concentration. Considering that treatment of AK according to the new indication will 
cover a wider surface area, with potentially repeated use, this information confirms that there should 
be no potential implications derived by the exposure based on the extended use of the product. This 
information has been adequately reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC.

Treatments 
BF-200 ALA packed in tubes (two tubes per patient) were assigned to allow for retreatment, if 
necessary. Each tube was sufficient to cover 1-2 fields of approximately 20 cm2 in total. The treatment 
field(s) were prepared for drug application by degreasing (using ethanol or isopropanol) and 
subsequently removing all scabs, crusts, and hyperkeratotic parts (using curettage). ALA was applied 
over 1-2 fields of approximately 20 cm2 in total, allowed to dry for approximately 10 minutes, and 
covered with occlusive tape material for 3 h. Thereafter, any remnants of the applied formulation were 
removed carefully and PDT illumination using the BF-RhodoLED lamp was administered. Patients with 
non-responding AK lesions were retreated with the same medication after 12 weeks.  
A placebo (a nanoemulsion gel formulation but without the active ingredient) was assigned to each 
patient, and administered in the same way as the BF-200 ALA. 
Planned duration was 1 day to 12 weeks: BF-200 ALA or placebo was administered for the first PDT 
session (PDT-1) after all screening procedures had been performed. A second PDT session (PDT-2) 
with BF-200 ALA or placebo was performed 12 weeks later if there were lesions that were not 
completely cleared.

For all patients, 2 FU visits at 6 and 12 months after the last PDT were scheduled.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of BF-200 ALA with placebo for the field-directed 
treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis (AK) with PDT when using the BF-RhodoLED lamp. 
The secondary objectives were: To evaluate the safety and secondary efficacy parameters related to 
BF-200 ALA for field-directed treatment of AK with PDT when using the BF-RhodoLED lamp in a 
multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group (2:1 ratio) with 84 patients 
were planned to be randomized. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  Overall patient complete response (complete clearance of all treated 
lesions) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT. An overall complete responder was defined as a patient 
in whom all treated AK lesions were cleared (Olsen score of 0) after the last PDT, i.e. after PDT-1 or 
after PDT-2 if re-treatment was performed.

defined on a 5-point scale taking into account the investigator’s ratings of the skin quality 
parameters.

Sample size 
A sample size of 56 patients in the active treatment arm and 28 patients in the placebo arm ensured a 
power of more than 90% to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in response rates with a 
Fisher’s exact test in the FAS. This estimate was based on the assumption of an expected placebo 
response rate of 27.5% (based on a previous study), an expected BF-200 ALA response rate of 72.5%, 
and a rate of missing or non-evaluable observations that cannot be imputed of 10%. As it cannot be 
excluded that these cases are missing not at random and related to an unfavourable outcome, these 
patients were considered non-responders. A randomization ratio of BF-200 ALA and placebo of 2:1 was 
selected.  The sample size is a multiple of 12 to stratify randomization by study site assuming 12 
patients per site. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 allocation ratio of active treatment to control. Randomisation was 
stratified by center. Six to 18 patients were to be enrolled per site (up to 24 patients with prior 
permission). The randomisation schedule was automated for random assignment. The randomisation 
was performed in blocks to facilitate attainment of a homogeneous distribution of treatment groups 
and block size was not revealed before study completion. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was performed in a double-blind fashion. Active treatment and placebo were manufactured 
and packaged to ensure blinding. To guarantee the blind status of the investigator assessing efficacy 
after each PDT session, a second investigator or delegated person performed the PDT and conducted 
all safety evaluations during the PDT and the telephone call 1 week after PDT. 
Statistical methods 
The primary null hypothesis was that the overall complete responder rate assessed 12 weeks after the 
last PDT for patients treated with BF-200 ALA is equal to that of patients treated with placebo. Fisher’s 
exact test was used to test the primary hypothesis on a significance level of 0.05 two-sided. The 
impact of missing data on the results were to be evaluated with sensitivity analyses if the number and 
frequency distribution of missing data indicated a possibly substantial influence on primary or 
secondary efficacy results (e.g. a worst-case analysis). 
No interim analysis was foreseen or performed. 
A hierarchic test procedure was used for confirmatory hypothesis testing of secondary variables 
measured during the double-blind treatment period. These tests were to be performed only after the 
test of the primary efficacy variable was passed and were conducted in a strictly pre-defined order to 
Assessment report  
EMA/630770/2016  
Page 14/55 
 
 
 
 
ensure the family-wise error rate. Hypothesis testing in the pre-defined order was to stop once the first 
non-significant test-result was obtained. The secondary endpoints included different response variables 
(patient based histopathological confirmed response rate, patient based complete response, lesion 
based complete response, patient based partial response (at least 75% of lesions)), analysed with 
similar methods as the primary endpoint, reduction of total lesion area per patient, evaluated by 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with factor treatment and baseline total lesion area as covariate, and 
overall cosmetic outcome, analysed with a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Secondary endpoints were 
assessed 12 weeks after last PDT. Primary and secondary efficacy analyses were performed on the full 
analysis set. 
Exploratory subgroups analyses in pre-defined subgroups of interest were performed by analysis in 
strata, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests adjusted for subgroups and by logistic regression. 
Continuous data was summarised by using descriptive statistics. Categorical variables were 
summarised by using frequency and percentages. Laboratory values were classified as normal or 
abnormal according to the laboratories normal ranges and indicated as clinically significant or not 
clinically significant by the investigator, and shift tables illustrating changes with respect to the normal 
ranges between baseline and endpoint were also presented. Vital signs focused on change from 
baseline to the scheduled time points after baseline. All other safety variables were analysed 
descriptively. The safety analyses were performed for the safety analysis set. 
Results 
Recruitment 
This study was conducted in 7 centres in Germany. Of 94 patients enrolled in this study, 87 patients 
were randomised (55 patients to BF-200 ALA and 32 patients to placebo); the remaining 7 patients 
were excluded from the study due to screening failures. 
Conduct of the study 
Seven randomized patients prematurely discontinued the clinical part of the study: 5 patients due to 
patient’s decision (all in the placebo group) and 2 patients were lost to follow-up (one patient in each 
group). In total, 10 patients included in the FAS had at least one major protocol deviation and were 
excluded from the PP population. A summary of major protocol deviations is presented in Table 1.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy: Overall patient complete response 12 weeks after the last PDT 
At 12 weeks after the last PDT, 50 (90.9%) patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 7 (21.9%) patients 
in the placebo group showed complete clearance of AK lesions.

Secondary endpoints 
A hierarchic test procedure was used for confirmatory hypothesis testing of secondary variables 
measured during the double-blind treatment period. These tests were to be performed in a strictly pre-
defined order to ensure the family-wise error rate. The results of the secondary endpoints are 
presented in this pre- defined order. 
Histopathological confirmed response rates (HCR) 
Assessments of HCR rates were based on the results from the biopsy taken 12 weeks after the last 
PDT from a representative AK lesion selected at screening. 
Table 9: 
Histopathological confirmed response rates 12 weeks after last PDT 
The HCR was evaluated in subgroups, the HCR rates were higher in the BF-200 ALA group compared to 
placebo and the comparison between BF-200 ALA and placebo by Fisher’s exact test yielded low p-
values in most subgroups except for the subgroups with too small sample size to allow a quantitative 
assessment of the treatment effect (data not shown). 
Patient complete response 12 weeks after PDT-1 
At 12 weeks after PDT-1, patient complete response rates were considerably higher in the BF- 200 ALA 
group than in the placebo group (61.8% vs. 9.4%) and the difference in responder rates between the 
groups was statistically significant. 
Table 10: 
Patient complete response 12 weeks after PDT-1 - FAS 
In all subgroups, the patient complete response 12 weeks after PDT-1 were higher in the BF- 200 ALA 
group compared to the placebo group and the comparison between BF-200 ALA and placebo by 
Fisher’s exact test yielded low p-values in most subgroups except for the subgroups with too small 
sample size to allow a quantitative assessment of the treatment effect (data not shown).

The number of completely cleared individual lesions at each assessment was analysed by means of 
negative binomial regression with factor treatment and number of AK lesions at baseline as covariate. 
The results are summarized in Table 11. 
Table 11: 
Lesion complete response 12 weeks after last PDT - FAS 
In all subgroups analysed, lesion complete responses 12 weeks after last PDT were higher in the BF-
200 ALA group compared to the placebo group. For both treatment groups, Grade I AK lesions at 
baseline had higher response rate 12 weeks after the last PDT than Grade II lesions (99.1% vs. 91.7% 
in the BF-200 ALA group and 49.2% vs. 24.1% in the placebo group). Likewise, AK lesions located on 
treatment area A (face) had higher response to treatment than AK lesions located on treatment area B 
(bald scalp) (97.1% vs. 90.2% in the BF-200 ALA group and 47.3% vs. 16.3% in the placebo group).

The mean percentage reduction in total lesion area per patient 12 weeks after last PDT compared to 
baseline was higher in the BF-200 ALA group than in the placebo group (98.2% vs. 45.5%). In all 
subgroups, mean percentage reductions in total lesion area per patient 12 weeks after last PDT were 
higher in the BF-200 ALA group than in the placebo group. The comparison between BF-200 ALA and 
placebo by ANCOVA yielded low p-values for most subgroups, except for the subgroups with too small 
sample sizes (data not shown). 
Overall cosmetic outcome 12 weeks after last PDT 
Table 14: 
Cosmetic outcome 12 weeks after last PDT - FAS 
In most of the subgroups, a higher percentage of patients had “very good or good” cosmetic outcome 
12 weeks after the last PDT (with baseline sum score of 0 excluded) in the BF-200 ALA group than in 
placebo. 
Patient complete response 3-4 weeks after PDT-1, 3-4 weeks and 12 weeks after PDT-2, and 3-4 
weeks after last PDT 
Overall, the complete responder rates were considerably higher in the BF-200 ALA group compared to 
placebo at all assessment time points.

Ancillary analyses 
Follow-up (FU) phase of the study and the end of the FU of 12 months after last PDT 
The database lock for the follow up phase was 28 May 2015. All 80 patients who completed the clinical 
phase (54 patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 26 patients in the placebo group) and 4 of 7 patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/630770/2016  
Page 23/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
withdrawn from the clinical phase (all in the placebo group) were included in the FU. Thus, 84 patients 
overall (54 patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 30 patients in the placebo group) entered the FU 
phase of the study. In the BF-200 ALA group, 49 patients were complete responders 12 weeks after 
the last PDT (33 patients 12 weeks after PDT1, and 16 patients 12 weeks after PDT2), in the vehicle 
group 7 patients were complete responders (3 patients 12 weeks after PDT1, and 4 patients 12 weeks 
after PDT2). 54 patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 26 patients of the vehicle group completed the 
FU. 4 patients (all in the vehicle group) prematurely discontinued the FU phase due to being lost to 
follow-up. 
The related number of lesions entering FU was 294 in the BF-200 ALA group and 162 in the vehicle 
group. Of these lesions 247 (93.9%) were cleared after the last PDT (84.0% after PDT1 and 31.3% 
after PDT2) in the BF-200 ALA group. In the vehicle group, 52 (32.1%) were cleared after the last PDT 
(33 (20.4%) after PDT1 and 34 (21.0%) after PDT2). For 1 patient in the BF-200 ALA group (patient 
0407), the assessment of one AK lesion 12 weeks after the last PDT was changed by the investigator 
from cleared to non-cleared after primary analysis reporting, which resulted in a slight difference in the 
total number of cleared lesions 12 months after last PDT between FAS and FAS-FUP analysis sets. 
Furthermore, 4 AK lesions were not included in the FAS-FUP as the patient with these cleared lesions 
at the end of the clinical phase did not enter the FU. The subject based evaluation was performed with 
all subjects in the follow-up period who were completely cleared at the end of the study (49 patients in 
the BF-200 ALA and 7 patients in the vehicle groups). In the BF-200 ALA group, recurrent AK lesions 
were observed in approximately 25% of those patients at 6 months FU (12 of 49 patients) and another 
6 (12%) patients at 12 months FU. In the vehicle group, of 7 patients with complete remission after 
the last PDT, 6 (85.7%) patients remained cleared during the FU and 1 (14.3%) patient had a 
recurrent AK lesion at 6 months FU (Table 16).  
Table 16: 
Patient recurrence rate of AK lesions during follow-up (FAS FU population), 
ALA-AK CT007 follow-up 
Lesion recurrence rates were low in both treatment groups, with 1.9% and 6.2% in the vehicle and BF-
200 ALA groups, respectively, at the 6-month follow-up visit. Lower lesion recurrence rates were 
observed after the second 6-month period of the FU (at FU2/since FU1) with 0% and 2.9%, 
respectively (Table 17).

Since field treatment was applied in the ALA-AK-CT007 study, the follow-up of the skin quality 
parameters (including skin surface, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, mottled or irregular 
pigmentation, degree of scarring, and atrophy), as assessed by the investigator at FU1 and FU2 was of 
particular interest as the larger coherent areas outside the actual lesions allowed a better assessment 
of the cosmetic outcome. For the assessment, a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, and severe) was 
applied. All parameters of skin quality were further improved compared to the end of the study. At 
both FU visits, improvements were reported for a higher proportion of patients in the BF-200 ALA 
group compared to the vehicle group. Skin parameters improved continuously between FU1 and FU2 
(Table 18).

Summary of main study 
A summary of the efficacy results from the main study supporting the present application is presented 
below. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well 
as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). 
ALA-AK-CT007 
Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group (2:1 ratio). 84 patients were 
planned to be randomized. 
Primary objective: Comparison of efficacy of BF-200 ALA with placebo for field-directed treatment of 
mild to moderate actinic keratosis (AK) with PDT, using BF-RhodoLED lamp. 
Secondary  objectives:  Evaluation  of  safety  and  secondary  efficacy  parameters  related  to  BF-200  ALA 
for field-directed treatment of AK with PDT, using BF-RhodoLED lamp.  
Efficacy  results:  Overall  complete  responder  rates 12  weeks  after  the last  PDT  considerably  higher in 
the  BF-200  ALA  group  (50  [90.9%]  patients)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (7  [21.9%]  patients).  The 
results of the Fisher’s exact test of the comparison in complete responder rates between BF- 200 ALA 
Assessment report  
EMA/630770/2016  
Page 26/55 
 
 
 
 
 
and  placebo  (p<0.0001)  demonstrated  the  superiority  of  BF-200  ALA  to  placebo.  The  robustness  of 
these results was confirmed by the per-protocol (PP) analysis. 
The  confirmatory  analysis  of  all  key  secondary  variables  supported  the  superiority  of  BF-200  ALA  to 
placebo shown in the primary analysis. The results demonstrated a significant treatment effect of BF-
200  ALA  to  placebo  for  all  key  secondary  efficacy  variables  tested  in  the  hierarchic  multiple  test 
procedure. 
Superiority of BF-200-ALA to placebo was also supported by the exploratory analyses of the complete 
and partial responder rates, lesion complete response, and change from baseline in total lesion area at 
all  assessment  time  points.  No  patients  in  the  BF-200  ALA  group  had  new  AK  lesions.  In  the  placebo 
group,  only  one  patient  presented  with  new  lesions  12  weeks  after  PDT-2.  All  parameters  of  skin 
quality  (skin  surface,  hyperpigmentation,  mottled  or  irregular  pigmentation,  degree  of  scarring,  and 
atrophy) improved in higher proportions of patients in the BF-200 ALA group compared to the placebo 
group 12 weeks after the last PDT. The proportion of patients with improvements in skin quality due to 
treatment  with  BF-200  ALA  ranged  from  35.7%  to  69.6%  of  patients  (excluding  baseline  evaluation 
“none”)  for  improvement  in  degree  of  scarring  and  skin  surface,  respectively.  Very  good  or  good 
cosmetic  outcome  was  reported  for  32  (66.7%)  patients  in  the  BF-200  ALA  group  and  9  (34.5%) 
patients in the placebo group. 
All  efficacy  variables  in  this  study  were  analyzed  in  an  exploratory  way  for  a  number  of  subgroups 
including:  (maximum)  baseline  severity  of  AK  lesions,  age,  gender,  skin  type  and  skin  type  group, 
treatment area, number of AK lesions at baseline, AK history, and study center. For all subgroups, the 
results of the efficacy variables at all assessment time points supported the superiority of BF-200 ALA 
over placebo shown in the overall population. Patients with Grade I AK lesions at baseline had higher 
complete  responder  rates  12  weeks  after  the  last  PDT  than  patients  with  Grade  II  lesions  for  both 
treatment groups (10 [100%] vs. 40 [88.9%] patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 5 [71.4%] vs. 2 
[8.0%] patients in the placebo group). Results for the treatment area subgroups revealed 
higher overall responder rates in patients with AK lesions located on the face only (treatment area A) 
than in patients with AK lesions located on the bald scalp only (treatment area B) (96.9% vs. 81.8% in 
the BF-200 ALA group and 35.3% vs. 7.1% in the placebo group). The vast majority of patients in the 
BF-200  ALA  group  were  satisfied  by  the  treatment:  49  (90.7%)  patients  rated  their  satisfaction  as 
“very  good  or  good”  and  only  1  (1.9%)  patient  was  not  satisfied  by  the  treatment.  In  the  placebo 
group, “very good or good” satisfaction was reported by 13 (44.8%) patients and more than one third 
(11 [37.9%] patients) were unsatisfied by the treatment. None of the patients was impaired by the BF-
200 ALA or placebo treatments.

The full description of the study was presented in the EPAR for the initial marketing authorisation. Of 
the 570 subjects in the ITT population, 549 completed the clinical treatment phase of the study and 
entered the follow-up phase (ITTFU population): 68, 241 and 240 from the vehicle, BF-200 ALA and 
Metvix groups, respectively. Of the 549 patients in the ITTFU, follow-up was completed by 532 
(96.9%) patients. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Recurrence at the 6- or 12-month follow-up (combined) in complete responders who completed follow-
up was observed for 3 (23.1%) patients who had received vehicle and 77 (41.6%) and 69 (44.8%) 
patients who had received BF-200 ALA and Metvix, respectively. At the end of follow-up (12 months 
after the last PDT) 10 (79.9%) patients in the vehicle groups, 108 (58.4%) patients in the BF-200 ALA 
group and 85 (55.2%) patients in the Metvix group had still no recurrent lesions.

The AK recurrence rate was also calculated on a lesion basis. The AK lesion recurrence rate was 3.6%, 
11.4% and 6.6% in the vehicle, BF-200 ALA and Metvix groups, respectively, at the 6-month follow-up 
visit, and 13.1%, 14.7% and 18.8%, respectively, at the 12-month follow up visit.

The full description of the study was presented in the EPAR for the initial marketing authorisation. 122 
subjects (81 subjects receiving BF-200 ALA and 41 subjects receiving placebo) entered the main phase 
of the study. 8 subjects (4 in each treatment group) did not complete the main phase as planned and 
did not enter the follow up phase, i.e. 77 subjects in the BF-200 ALA and 37 subjects in the placebo 
group entered the follow-up phase. 4 subjects (2 in each treatment group) were lost to follow-up prior 
to any follow-up assessments. Month 6 assessments were available for 72 subjects in the BF-200 ALA

and 34 subjects in the placebo group, month-12 assessments were available for 71 subjects in the BF-
200 ALA and 32 subjects in the placebo group. 
Of the 114 subjects in the ITT population, all 114 completed the clinical treatment phase of the study, 
and 102 patients completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up: 70 in the BF-200 ALA group 
and 32 in the vehicle group. The subject based evaluation was performed with all subjects in the 
follow-up period who were completely cleared at the end of the study (53 patients in the BF-200 ALA 
and 5 patients in the vehicle groups). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Patient AK recurrence rates were 17.0% and 40.0% for the BF-200 ALA and vehicle groups, 
respectively, at the 6-month follow-up visit, and 11.3% and 0%, respectively at the 12-month follow-
up visit. Patient recurrence rates were in favor for narrow spectrum lamps with 11.1% at the 6-month 
and 12 months follow-up visit each versus 23.1% and 11.5%, respectively for broad spectrum lamps.

The AK recurrence rate was also calculated on a lesion basis. The AK lesion recurrence rate was 4.4% 
and  7.1%  in  the  vehicle  and  BF-200  ALA  groups,  respectively,  at  the  6-month  follow-up  visit,  and 
4.4% and 7.9%, respectively, at the 12 -month follow-up visit. Again, recurrence rates were lower for 
narrow spectrum lamps compared to lesions treated with broad spectrum lamps.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A pooled analysis was performed with efficacy data from the three Phase III studies ALA-AK-CT002, 
ALA-AK-CT003, and ALA-AK-CT007. 
Table 26: 
Studies included in the integrated summary of efficacy 
The  primary  endpoint  for  all  three  studies  was  the  rate  of  complete  clearance,  defined  as  the 
percentage of patients for whom all treated AK lesions were completely cleared 12 weeks after the last 
PDT. 
An overview of the primary efficacy results is shown below.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical assessment for this variation application is based on the new phase III study ALA-AK-
CT007 and the data on the 6 and 12 month follow up data from studies ALA-AK-CT002 and ALA-AK-
CT003, which were the pivotal trials for the initial marketing authorisation application.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The primary endpoint and the response endpoints among the set of secondary endpoints were 
analysed using a Fisher exact test. This was presumably specified due to low expected response rates 
in the placebo arm. Although in retrospect it would not have been obligatory to use an exact test, this 
Assessment report  
EMA/630770/2016  
Page 36/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analysis method is considered acceptable and from a regulatory perspective, generally more 
conservative than the methods used in the other phase III studies of the program (a Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test in ALA-AK-CT003 and a chi-square test in ALA-AK-CT002). Type I error control is 
appropriate and the hierarchical procedure for the secondary endpoints allows confirmatory conclusions 
also for the secondary endpoints. Therefore, the statistical methods used for analysis in study ALA-AK-
CT007 were considered appropriate. 
There was no considerable impact of missing data on the study results, as only 2 patients in the 
placebo arm and one patient in the active arm had missing observations at 12 weeks. Therefore, 
sensitivity analyses are not considered necessary. 
The pre-specified subgroups analyses were considered appropriate.  It is noted that numbers in several 
subgroups (Grade I AK lesions, age <= 65 years, females, skin type I, skin type IV and higher, AK 
lesion of <=400 mm2, AK naïve patients) were very small. Therefore, the results comparing these 
subgroups have to be interpreted with caution. This also relates to apparent differences in treatment 
effects. Overall the subgroups results can be considered consistent. 
The methods used for the pooled analyses across trials of the phase III program, including the studies 
ALA-AK-CT007, ALA-AK-CT003 and ALA-AK-CT002, are considered appropriate. The study 
characteristics and key design features are considered sufficiently similar to allow a pooled analysis 
across the study program. The studies had the same main inclusion criteria for patients (4 to 8 AK 
target lesions 0.5 to 1.5 cm diameter of mild to moderate severity with an overall size of 
approximately 20 cm2). In ALA-AK-CT007, the lesions were to be located within one to two fields of 20 
cm2, which was not required for the other two studies. The studies had an identical schedule for the 
PDT treatments and timing for the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint and used the same 
primary efficacy endpoint (complete patient-based clearance rate) at 12 weeks after the last PDT. 
Of note, the studies used different analysis set definitions for assessment of efficacy. The primary 
analysis set for efficacy of the integrated analysis comprised all patients randomised and treated at 
least once, and the same definition was used in studies ALA-AK-CT007 and ALA-AK-CT002, whereas in 
study ALA-AK-CT003, the primary analysis was performed in all patients randomized and treated at 
least once with the product and who had a least one post-dose assessment. Therefore, some of the 
results of the pooled analysis differ from the results in the original study report. However, these small 
differences have no impact on conclusions from the results. 
Red-light illumination was chosen since light with longer wave lengths penetrates deeper into the 
tissue. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For trial ALA-AK-CT007, the topical application of BF-200 ALA with PDT was shown to be superior to 
placebo for treatment of AK. The overall patient complete response rate 12 weeks after the last PDT 
was considerably higher in the BF-200 ALA group than in the placebo group (90.9% vs. 21.9% of 
patients, <0.0001; FAS). Results of the confirmatory analyses of all secondary efficacy variables also 
showed superiority of BF-200 ALA to placebo. 
A higher number of patients with Grade I AK lesions at baseline were complete responders 12 weeks 
after the last PDT compared to patients with Grade II lesions (100% vs. 88.9% of patients treated with 
BF-200 ALA). Complete responder rates were higher in patients with AK lesions located on the face 
(treatment area A) only than in patients with AK lesions located on the bald scalp only (96.9% vs. 
81.8% of patients) (treatment area B). 
Topical application of BF-200 ALA resulted in improvements of skin quality 12 weeks after the last PDT 
compared to baseline. The most prominent improvements were observed in the skin surface 
Assessment report  
EMA/630770/2016  
Page 37/55 
 
 
 
 
(roughness, dryness, and scaliness), reported in 69.6% of patients in the BF-200 ALA group, and 
mottled and irregular pigmentation, reported in 50.0% of the patients. The cosmetic outcome (with 
baseline sum score 0 excluded) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT was considered as very good or 
good in 66.7% of patients in the BF 200 ALA group, compared to 34.6% of patients in the placebo 
group. The vast majority of patients treated with BF-200 ALA were satisfied by treatment results. In 
total, 90.7% of the patients rated their satisfaction as “very good or good” and only 1 (1.9%) patient 
was not satisfied by the treatment. 
The follow up period for trial ALA-AK-CT007 showed that patient lesion recurrence rates were in favour 
for the vehicle where new lesions in the treated field(s) were observed in 4 patients (7.4%) (one lesion 
in one subject at month 6, and in 3 subjects at months 12) in the BF-200 ALA group compared to no 
new lesions were observed in the vehicle group. The MAH clarified that none of the lesions were in the 
treated field (the region actually treated with BF-200 ALA) and only 3 lesions (one Bowen’s, one BCC, 
one SCC) were in the respective treatment area (either face/forehead or scalp). The placebo had one 
lesion about 2-fold smaller, providing evidence that there was no increased non-melanoma malignancy 
in the treated areas. The majority of patients in both treatment groups had at least good cosmetic 
outcome at the end of the FU (83.3% and 87.5% of patients in the BF-200 ALA and placebo groups, 
respectively). Patients’ contentment was reported by a higher proportion of patients in the BF-200 ALA 
group than in the placebo group at the end of the FU (77.8% vs. 69.2% patients) (see clinical safety 
section).  
Study ALA-AK-CT002 follow up data showed that patients with completely cleared lesions 12 weeks 
after the last PDT (i.e. at the end of the clinical treatment phase), 41.6% in the BF-200 ALA group had 
recurrent lesions at 6 and/or 12 months follow up compared to 44.8% in the Metvix group and 23.1% 
in the placebo group. Overall, cosmetic outcome was comparable for Metvix and BF-200 ALA and 
better than for placebo. At 12 months follow-up in subjects that had been classified as complete 
responders at 12 weeks after the last PDT and that were still cleared (free of lesions) after 6 months 
follow-up in the BF-200 ALA group, 14.7% of the lesions were reported to be recurrent, compared to 
18.8% in the Metvix group and 11.4% in the placebo group. The MAH provided a retrospective analysis 
of the neoplasia that occurred in patients either during the clinical phase (CSR) or the follow-up (FUP) 
which showed that 4.9 % of the patients in the BF-200 ALA group, 9.8 % of the Metvix patients and 
9.7 % of the placebo patients displayed neoplastic lesions. Therefore, there appears that there is no 
solid evidence that patients in the BF-200 ALA group had an increased risk of developing novo skin 
neoplasia (see clinical safety section).  
Study ALA-AK-CT003 follow up data showed that patients with complete clearance at the end of the 
study, 28.3% of the subjects in the BF-200 ALA group compared to 40.0% of subjects in the placebo 
group had recurrent lesions during the 12-month follow-up.  Comparison of the recurrence rate after 
BF-200 ALA treatment to placebo treatment was limited by to the low number of subjects with 
complete clearance (4 available subjects) and the low number of cleared lesions (45 lesions) at the 
end of the study in the placebo group. New AK lesions in the target area were observed slightly more 
often in the BF-200 ALA group than in the placebo group, however the difference was not statistically 
significant. Skin quality assessments and overall cosmetic outcome showed no substantial differences 
between the treatment groups. During a 12-month follow-up period, 15% of the lesions cleared at the 
end of the study after treatment with PDT and BF-200 ALA group were recurrent; in the placebo group 
slightly fewer lesions (8.8%) were recurrent. The MAH provided a retrospective analysis of the 
neoplasia that occurred in patients either during the clinical phase (CSR) or the follow-up (FUP). 
Indicated are the patient number and the preferred term (PT) which showed that neoplasia was 
detected in 3.1% in the BF-200 ALA group and 5.1% in the placebo group, indicating that there is no 
increased risk of novo skin neoplasia (see clinical safety section).

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Trial ALA-AK-CT007 met it’s primary endpoint and showed efficacy in the treatment of field 
cancerisation with ALA, where overall patient complete response at 12 weeks and clearance of lesions 
was observed. The primary efficacy results were supported by the secondary endpoints. The results 
are considered statistically significant and clinically meaningful. It also showed that field-directed 
treatment skin quality improved continuously from baseline to FU2. Overall, the results of the FU 
analyses were in agreement with the data of the clinical phase by demonstrating higher rates of 
patient- and lesion-wise clearance in the BF-200 ALA group vs. placebo at the end of FU. Follow up 
data from studies ALA-AK-CT002, ALA-AK-CT003 and ALA-AKCT007 indicated that the efficacy 
achieved 12 weeks after the last PDT was generally maintained during a 12-month follow up period.  
All Phase III studies demonstrated that the use of illumination sources with a narrow wavelength 
spectrum, such as the BF-RhodoLED, seems to yield higher AK clearance rates than sources with a 
broad wavelength spectrum. Irrespective of the lamp, BF-200 ALA showed efficacy superior to placebo. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The MAH provided a follow up for the safety results of the studies ALA-AK-CT002, ALA-AK-CT003, and 
ALA-AK-CT007. 
Patient exposure 
The number of patients exposed to PDT-1 and PDT-2 by treatment area is presented in Table 33. All 87 
patients in the SAF were exposed to PDT in the first session: 32 patients received placebo and 55 
patients received BF-200 ALA.

The Safety Analysis Set included 384 patients who received BF-200 ALA with PDT and 149 patients 
who received vehicle with PDT. The study was completed by 96.9% and 87.9% of patients, 
respectively.

Adverse events  
ALA-AK-CT002 follow-up  
Of the 570 subjects in the ITT population, 549 completed the clinical treatment phase of the study and 
entered the follow-up phase (ITTFU population): 68, 241 and 240 from the vehicle, BF-200 ALA and 
Metvix groups, respectively. Of the 549 patients in the ITTFU, follow-up was completed by 532 
(96.9%) patients. AEs during ALA-AK-CT002 follow-up included basal cell carcinoma (1.2%, 1.7%, 0% 
in theBF-200 ALA, Metvix and vehicle groups, respectively), seborrheic keratosis (1.2%, 1.3%,0%), 
squamous cell carcinoma of skin (0.4%, 0%, 0%; 0%, 0.4%, 1.5%) resp.), Bowen's disease (0%, 
1.3%, 1.5%), skin papilloma (0%, 0%, 1.5%). There was no report of melanoma. AK was reported for 
2 subjects in both the BF-200 ALA and Metvix groups. None of these AEs was regarded by the 
investigator as treatment-related. 
ALA-AK-CT003 follow-up 
Of the 114 subjects in the FAS population, all 114 completed the clinical treatment phase of the study, 
and 102 (89.5%) patients completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up: 70 in the BF-200 ALA 
group and 32 in the vehicle group. Overall, 4 subjects (3 in the BF-200 ALA group and 1 in the vehicle 
group) had a new non-melanoma or melanoma skin cancers in the treatment area (face and forehead, 
bald scalp). Two subjects had a superficial cell carcinoma (in month 6 and 12, both BF-200 ALA) and 2 
subjects had a nodular basal cell carcinoma (one BF-200 ALA, one placebo, both in month 6).

ALA-AK-CT005 
In a clinical trial (ALA-AK-CT005) designed to investigate the sensitization potential of ALA with 216 
healthy subjects, 13 subjects (6%) developed allergic contact dermatitis after continuous exposure for 
21 days with doses of ALA that were higher than doses normally used in the treatment of AK. Allergic 
contact dermatitis has not been observed under regular treatment conditions. 
Study ALA-AK-CT006 
More TEAEs were observed after application of the ALA gel and subsequent illumination compared to 
the placebo gel (10 TEAEs in 4 patients vs. 1 TEAE in 1 patient). After application of the ALA gel, 10 
TEAEs were observed in 4 of the 12 patients. Seven of the 10 TEAEs occurred in one patient. Seven 
events were of moderate severity and 3 events were of mild severity. A relationship to the IMP was 
considered certain for 5 of the 10 events, probable for 3 of the 10 events, possible for 1 of the 10 
events, and unlikely for 1 of the 10 events. 
The TEAEs considered to have a causal relationship to the ALA gel were 6 local TEAEs (eyelid oedema, 
swelling face, application site erosion, application site pruritus, and application site pain and feeling 
hot) and headache. 
No deaths and no SAEs occurred. No discontinuations due to an AE were reported. All TEAEs had 
recovered by the end of the study. No clinically relevant changes in laboratory, vital sign, and ECG 
parameters between screening and follow-up were observed. Pain and local tolerability assessment 
revealed pain and skin reactions to occur more often after application of ALA gel compared to the 
placebo gel. Immediately after PTD treatment following placebo gel application, none of the patients 
developed pain in the treatment area. After PTD treatment following ALA gel application, all patients 
developed pain. Most of the patients developed pain of moderate intensity; one patient had pain of 
severe intensity. 
Twenty-four hours after placebo gel application, mild dryness was observed in 8 patients and mild 
itching was observed in 1 patient. After ALA gel application all patients showed skin reactions of mild 
or moderate intensity and all investigated skin reactions (erythema, dryness, burning, erosion, 
oedema, and itching) were observed. The most frequently observed skin reaction was erythema, 
oedema, and burning. The most frequently moderate skin reaction was erythema. At follow-up, i.e., 
after a short time span of 7 days, no obvious improvement in skin reactions was observed compared to 
Period 2 (ALA gel). One Patient showed severe erythema and erosion at follow-up. The healing time 
was expected to be comparable with the one after first- and second-degree burns, i.e., 14 to 21 days. 
At the follow-up visit, the investigator assessed the overall tolerability as good in 9 patients, as 
satisfactory in 1 patient, and as not satisfactory in another patient. These results are in line with the 
SmPC of ALA. In clinical trials with ALA, local skin reactions at the application site were observed in 
about 90% of the subjects. The most common signs and symptoms observed were application site 
irritation, erythema, pain, and oedema which were usually of mild or moderate intensity. They lasted 
for 1 to 4 days in most cases; in some cases, however, they persisted for 1 to 2 weeks or even longer. 
Headache is also known to be commonly associated with ALA gel. 
ALA-AK-CT007 
The overall incidence of TEAEs was higher in the BF-200 ALA group than in the placebo group (100% 
vs. 68.8%). In both groups, the most commonly reported TEAEs were those of the application site, i.e. 
application site pain, erythema, pruritus, scab exfoliation, and oedema. The incidences of these TEAEs 
were higher in the BF-200 ALA group than in the placebo group. Application site pain was the most

common individual TEAE in both groups, reported in 53 (96.4%) patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 
in 16 (50.0%) patients in the placebo group. 
ALA-AK-CT007 follow-up 
Of the 84 subjects in the FAS population, 80 subjects completed the clinical treatment phase of the 
study. Furthermore, 4 patients withdrawn from the clinical phase entered the FU. 80 patients 
completed the FU phase; all 54 (100%) BF-200 ALA patients and 26 (86.7%) vehicle patients 
completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up). In ALA-AK-CT007 follow-up new lesions in the 
treated field(s) were observed in 16 patients (29.6%) in the BF-200 ALA group, and 4 lesions (13.3%) 
in the vehicle group. Of these, 3 were assessed as probably or possibly related. Moreover, the trend for 
an increase in carcinoma was also observed in ALA-AK-CT007, 6 AEs of neoplasms (2x basal cell 
carcinoma, 1x Bowen´s disease, 1x keratoacanthoma, 1x squamous cell carcinoma in situ, 1x 
acrochordon) were observed in the BF-200 ALA group vs. 0 in the placebo group. 
Overview of adverse events 
Overall, 64.4% (96/149) of patients who received vehicle and 96.6% (371/384) of patients who 
received BF-200 ALA had one or more AEs.

a “Application site hypersensitivity” was a faulty classification used at at single center in study ALA-AK-
CT002. The correct term should have been “application site hyperalgesia” as clarified by the investigator after 
database lock (see Appendix A.1.2 ALA-AK-CT002). 
For treatment-related AEs, one or more related AEs were reported for 88 (59.1%) patients who 
received vehicle and 368 (95.8%) patients who received BF-200 ALA.

Safety  Analysis  Set:  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  randomized  treatment  (BF-200  ALA  or  placebo/vehicle) 
irrespective of whether an illumination was performed. 
Frequently reported: incidence of ≥ 1% related AEs (preferred term) for any related TEAE that occurred through 12 weeks after 
the last PDT (end of study). 
Related: at least possibly related. 
PDT: photodynamic therapy; TEAE: treatment-emergent AE (AEs from first PDT to 12 weeks after last PDT or discontinuation) a 
Application site hypersensitivity” was a faulty classification used at a single center in study ALA-AK-CT002. The correct term 
should have been “application site hyperalgesia” as clarified by the investigator after database lock (see Appendix A.1.2, ALA-
AK-CT002). 
Analysis of the risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers 
In the pooled placebo group, 3% (4/132) of the patients developed new NMSC in the entire treatment 
areas (face and scalp), compared to 3.3% (12/366) of the patients in the pooled BF-200 ALA group.

In the BF-200 ALA group,  
- 4 patients (1.6 %) had one or two BCCs, 2 patients (0.8 %) had one or two SCCs, 1 patient (0.4 %) 
had a melanoma, 1 patient (0.4 %) had a sarcoma, and 4 (1.6 %) patients had a seborrheic keratosis.  
In the Metvix group,  
- 8 patients (3.3 %) presented with one or two BCCs, 5 patients (2.0 %) with an SCCs or 
keratoacanthoma, 4 patients (1.6 %) with Bowen’s disease, 5 patients (2.0 %) with a seborrheic 
keratosis, and 3 patients (1.2%) with various other neoplasms.  
In the placebo group,  
- 2 patients (2.8 %) had a BCC, 2 patients (2.8 %) an SCC, 2 patients (2.8 %) a Bowen’s disease, and 
1 patient (1.4 %) a skin papilloma.  
Together, 4.9 % of the patients in the BF-200 ALA group, 9.8 % of the Metvix patients and 9.7 % of 
the placebo patients displayed neoplastic lesions. 
A melanoma occurred in one patient in the BF-200 ALA group, none in the Metvix or placebo groups. 
According to the patient’s medical history, the patient affected by melanoma in the BF-200 ALA group 
suffered from 2 melanomas, an acanthoma, an SCC, and a dysplastic naevus syndrome prior to study 
start, which had been treated previously. 
The following neoplasia occurred in patients of study ALA-AK-CT003, either during the clinical phase 
(CSR) or the follow-up (FUP). Indicated are the patient number and the preferred term (PT):

report ALA-AK-CT003). Diagnosis was stated more precisely as squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell 
carcinoma, respectively. 
In the BF-200 ALA group  
- 2 patients (2.6 %) presented with a BCC, 1 patient (1.3 %) with an SCC.  
In the placebo group,  
- one patient (2.7 %) had a BCC and one patient (2.4 %) an SCC. There was no melanoma. The SCC 
in the placebo group was identified through the second biopsy taken at the end of the study. 
Percent values were calculated using for BF-200 ALA the safety population of 81 patients in the CSR 
and 77 patients in the FU, and for placebo 41 patients in the CSR and 37 patients in the FU. 
Again, based on the number of patients with neoplasia (together 3.1% in the BF-200 ALA group and 
5.1% in the placebo group) there is no indication for an increased risk of neoplasia after ALA PDT. 
The following neoplasia occurred in patients of study ALA-AK-CT007, either during the clinical phase 
(CSR) or the follow-up (FUP).:

In summary, in the BF-200 ALA group  
- there were 2 patients with one or two BCCs (3.7 %), 2 SCC or keratocanthoma (3.7 %), 1 
seborrhoeic keratosis (1.8 %) and 1 Bowen’s disease patient (1.8 %). In one patient an acorchordon 
(1.8 %) was observed which is a harmless small benign tumor. 
In the placebo group, which was about half the size of the verum group,  
- only one case of seborrheic keratosis (3.1 %) was observed.  
One BCC at the shoulder of a patient in the ALA group was already present prior to PDT. There was no 
melanoma in either group.

Percent values were calculated using for BF-200 ALA the safety population of 55 patients in the CSR 
and 54 patients in the FU, and for placebo 32 patients in the CSR and 30 patients in the FU. 
The total percentage of neoplasia was 18.3 % in the BF-200 ALA group (16.5 % without the BCC that 
was present already before PDT) and 3.1 % in the placebo group, 
Pooled analysis 
In the pooled analysis, only 1/366 patients in the BF-200 ALA group, 0/247 patients in the Metvix 
group and 0/132 patients in the placebo group presented with a malignant melanoma during the 
follow-up phase of the studies. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No serious adverse events or deaths observed during the clinical trials were considered drug related. 
In the SOC General disorders and administration site conditions, severe AEs were reported for 1.3% 
(2/149) of patients who received vehicle and 36.7% (141/384) of patients who received BF-200 ALA. 
Table 42: 
Incidence of frequently reported severe TEAEs - Safety Analysis Set 
There was no death in the Phase I/II clinical program, including study ALA-AK-CT005, study ALA-AK-
CT001 and study ALA-AK-CT006. In the Phase III program, no death was reported in study ALA-AK-
CT002, study ALA-AK-CT003, or study ALA-AK-CT007.  One death was reported in the context of the 
Phase III study ALA-AK-CT002 but was determined to be unrelated to the study drug. 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis data gave no indication for any drug-related changes 
(laboratory values over time, individual subject changes, and individual clinically significant 
abnormalities). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There was no AE that led to discontinuation in ALA-AK-CT003 or ALA-AK-CT007. In ALA-AK-CT002, 
one patient had AEs of application site pain and application site irritation on Day 1 that led to 
discontinuation and were assessed as definitely related to treatment. Illumination stopped one minute 
after start because of the severe application site pain and irritation (burning). 
Post marketing experience

There have been no safety signals from post-marketing sources. Since marketing in the EU early in 
2012 approx. 91.000 patients have been treated with BF-200 ALA gel. No spontaneous cases 
concerning melanoma or new NMSCs have been reported to the MAH. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In study ALA-AK-CT007, BF-200 ALA was well tolerated. The safety profile was consistent with the AK 
overall population which includes mainly elderly patients and similar characteristics of the underlying 
disease. The most commonly reported TEAEs (also the most commonly reported related TEAEs) were 
the TEAEs of the application site (application site pain, erythema, pruritus, scab exfoliation, and 
oedema). The frequency of serious TEAEs was very low and no related serious TEAEs were reported. 
Local skin reactions were mainly of mild to moderate intensity. In the BF-200 ALA group, the 
incidences shifted to less severe and more mild TEAEs rated as discomfort during and after PDT-2 
compared with PDT-1. In the placebo group, no conclusion can be drawn due to low number of 
patients who had PDT-2. In the ALA-AK-CT007 follow up study, safety analyses in the FU showed that 
treatment of AK lesions with BF-200 ALA is well tolerated. The overall lesion status in the treatment 
areas revealed comparable skin disease progression over the FU period in both treatment groups.  
In ALA-AK-CT002 follow-up, there was a marginal increased risk for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and AK 
in the verum group; in ALA-AK-CT003 follow up overall, 4 subjects (3 in the BF-200 ALA group and 1 
in the vehicle group) had a new non-melanoma or melanoma skin cancers in the treatment area (face 
and forehead, bald scalp). Two subjects in the BF-200 ALA group had a “superficial cell carcinoma” and 
2 subjects (one each for BF-200 ALA and placebo group) had a nodular basal cell carcinoma. In ALA-
AK-CT007 follow-up, a trend for an increase in carcinoma was also observed in ALA-AK-CT007, 6 AEs 
of neoplasms (2x basal cell carcinoma, 1x Bowen´s disease, 1x keratoacanthoma, 1xsquamous cell 
carcinoma in situ, 1x acrochordon/fibroma molle) were observed in the BF-200 ALA group vs. 0 in the 
placebo group. According to the results of the follow up studies of ALA-AK-CT002, ALA-AK-CT003, ALA-
AK-CT007, there seems to be a slight increase in the rate for non-melanoma skin cancer, including 
basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and carcinomata in situ respectively. 
There is no evidence that patients in the BF-200 ALA group had an increased ratio of neoplasia. 
Furthermore, there is no apparent pattern in the time of onset of neoplasia after PDT that may point 
towards a causal relationship. 
Percent values were calculated using for BF-200 ALA the safety population of 248 patients in the CSR 
and 241 patients in the FU, for Metvix 247 patients in the CSR and 240 in the FU, and for placebo 76 
patients in the CSR and 68 patients in the FU. 
In study ALA-AK-CT-007, it appears that a difference in the percentage of patients treated with ALA- 
and placebo that have neoplasia potentially may exist. However, since in study ALA-AK-CT007 all 
lesions were followed separately and the location of new lesions was well documented, it can be stated 
that none of the lesions were in the treated field (the region actually treated with BF-200 ALA) and 
only 3 lesions (one Bowen’s, one BCC, one SCC) were in the respective treatment area (either 
face/forehead or scalp). 
During the assessment, the PRAC concluded to delete nasopharyngitis from the list of safety concerns. 
The rationale for not listing nasopharyngitis as related AE and deleting it from the SmPC is as follows: 
- The frequency of nasopharyngitis was not increased in patients treated with PDT compared to the 
general population. Most patients complained of nasopharyngitis or bronchitis during the fall and 
winter, the typical season for these infections. No patient reported of repeated infections in the course 
of the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/630770/2016  
Page 50/55 
 
 
 
 
- Most of the cases were reported several weeks after PDT. Considering the late onset of the infections 
observed after the last PDT in both verum-treatment groups (ALA-AKCT002), the high incidences 
reported for nasopharyngitis especially in the elderly target population and the coincidence with the 
typical seasonal pattern, it was assumed that these AEs were highly unlikely to be induced by PDT 
treatment. 
- None of the reported cases of nasopharyngitis were serious and all patients recovered, 
- Nasopharyngitis is a self-limited disease. 
BF-200 ALA has been marketed in the EU since the beginning of 2012. No spontaneous safety cases 
related to nasopharyngitis have been reported and no cases are described in the literature. Also, no 
cases of nasopharyngitis have been rated as likely related or related in the clinical study ALA-AK-
CT007. Therefore, nasopharyngitis has been deleted in Section 4.8 of the updated. The PIL has been 
updated accordingly. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety of BF-200 ALA appears to be acceptable and also well tolerated in the photodynamic 
treatment of AK lesions on face and scalp with AK lesions located within 1-2 treatment fields of an 
overall size of an area of approximately 20 cm2. There were no unexpected safety concerns reported 
and most common ADRs were as expected, transient local skin reactions.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 14 June 2018.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH did not update the RMP during the procedure as this proposed extension of the indication is 
not a significant change in the product’s indication for use and does not lead to a significant change to 
the risk-benefit balance, since the disease area is similar, the treated age group remains unchanged, 
and the proposed treatment population is not materially different from the current. The MAH proposed 
to provide an updated RMP with the response to questions (RTQ) for the renewal of the MA 
(EMEA/H/C/002204/R/0023), waited by 16 August 2016, which was considered acceptable by the 
PRAC rapporteur.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication to include treatment of actinic keratosis of mild to moderate 
severity on the face and scalp (Olsen grade 1 to 2) and of field cancerization, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 
5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make minor editorial 
changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet and to bring section 6.6 of the SmPC in line with the latest 
QRD template. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package

leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The additional information in the SmPC does not substantially change to the PL or the readability of the 
PL.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The clinical efficacy of BF-200 ALA nanoemulsion gel for PDT in study ALA-AK-CT007 in subjects with 
AK target lesions of mild to moderate intensity (AK grade 1 and 2 according to Olsen et al. 1991) 
within 1-2 treatment fields (overall size of approximately 20 cm2) in the treatment area of the face and 
forehead or bald scalp (excluding eyes, nostrils, ears, and mouth). Ameluz was superior to vehicle with 
respect to patient complete clearance rates (90.9% vs. 21.9% for Ameluz and placebo, respectively; p 
< 0.0001) and lesion complete clearance rates (94.3% vs. 32.9%, respectively; p < 0.0001), as 
controlled 12 weeks after the last PDT.  96.9% of patients with AK on the face or forehead were 
cleared from all lesions, 81.8% of patients with AK on the scalp were totally cleared. Lesions of mild 
severity were cleared by 99.1% vs. 49.2%, those of moderate intensity by 91.7% vs. 24.1% for 
treatment with Ameluz or placebo, respectively. After only 1 PDT complete patient clearance resulted 
in 61.8% vs. 9.4%, and complete lesion clearance in 84.2% vs. 22.0% for Ameluz or placebo 
treatment, respectively. Clinical efficacy was maintained during the follow-up periods of 6 and 12 
months after the last photodynamic therapy. After Ameluz treatment, 6.2% of the lesions were 
recurrent after 6 and additionally 2.9% after 12 months, respectively (placebo: 1.9% after 6 and 
additionally 0% after 12 months, respectively).  
The efficacy data from the pooled analysis supported the overall efficacy in the single study outcome.  
Generally, the effects of BF-200 ALA on all efficacy variables were consistent in all analyses of 
subgroup populations stratified by age, sex, lamp type, skin type, AK lesion severity, number of AK 
lesions at baseline, and AK lesion area.  
Follow up data of the Phase III studies ALA-AK-CT002, ALA-AK-CT003 and ALA-AKCT007 demonstrated 
that the efficacy achieved 12 weeks after the last PDT was highly maintained during a 12-month follow 
up period. In study ALA-AK-CT002, recurrence rates were slightly lower than those achieved with MAL 
in all subgroups. Moreover, as demonstrated in study ALA-AK-CT007 with field-directed treatment skin 
quality improved continuously from baseline to FU2.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Patient and lesion recurrence rates were in favor for the vehicle in all follow up studies.  In study ALA-
AK-CT002 follow up, at 12 months follow-up in subjects that had been classified as complete 
responders 12 weeks after the last PDT and that were still cleared (free of lesions) after 6 months 
follow-up in the BF-200 ALA group 14.7% of the lesions were reported to be recurrent compared to 
11.4% in the placebo group. For study ALA-AK-CT003 follow up, during a 12-month follow-up period, 
15% of the lesions after were recurrent after treatment with PDT and BF-200 ALA group compared to 
8.8% in the placebo group. For study ALA-AK-CT007 follow up, patient recurrence rates were 24.5 % 
and 14.3 % after 6 months, and additionally 12.2 % and 0 % after 12 months for Ameluz and placebo, 
respectively. However, it appears that overall treatment taking into consideration the study period as 
well as the follow up period, there is a lack of statistical significance between the incidence of skin 
neoplasia between BF-200 ALA and placebo in all studies. In many cases, the lesions appeared in areas

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In study ALA-AK-CT007, the safety profile was consistent with other studies. The most commonly 
reported TEAEs were application site pain, erythema, pruritus, scab exfoliation, and oedema. The 
frequency of serious TEAEs was very low and no related serious TEAEs were reported. Local skin 
reactions were mainly of mild to moderate intensity. Safety analyses in the FU period showed that 
treatment of AK lesions with BF-200 ALA was well tolerated.  
No serious adverse events or deaths observed during the clinical trials were considered drug related. 
Hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis data gave no indication for any drug-related changes 
(laboratory values over time, individual subject changes, and individual clinically significant 
abnormalities). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
For listing of the important identified risks, important potential risks and missing information, see RMP. 
According to the results of the follow up studies of ALA-AK-CT002, ALA-AK-CT003, ALA-AK-CT007 
there seems to be an increased rate for (non)melanoma skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma 
(BCC) and carcinoma in situ respectively. However, no clear causality between the risk and the 
treatment has been identified. The safety concerns will be closely monitored within the 
pharmacovigilance program from the MAH.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
BF-200 ALA was evaluated for PDT in adult subjects with AK lesions of mild to moderate severity on 
the face and/or scalp or with field cancerization. The efficacy results of the Phase III pivotal studies 
show a consistent and robust benefit with regard to the percentages of subjects with total AK lesion 
clearance and the total clearance of individual AK lesions compared to the vehicle control. In terms of 
safety, no new ADRs or safety concerns have been identified in study ALA-AK-CT007. The treatment is 
considered well tolerated and transient local skin reactions are manageable.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit observed with Ameluz in terms of clearance of mild and 
moderate severity AK lesions in the field treatment area of cancerisation outweigh the known safety 
risks. Therefore, the benefit-risk is considered positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The efficacy of BF-200 ALA nanoemulsion gel is considered demonstrated for PDT in adult subjects with 
AK lesions on the face and/or scalp and can be applied to field cancerization containing multiple AKs. 
The efficacy results of the Phase III pivotal studies are consistent and robust with regard to the 
superiority of BF-200 ALA over vehicle for both the percentages of subjects with total AK lesion 
clearance and the total clearance of individual AK lesion. Narrow-spectrum wavelength illumination 
yielded better results with regard to subject total AK lesion clearance which was associated with an 
increased incidence of local skin reactions and pain. These adverse reactions were, however, non-
serious and self-limiting with duration of up to 7 days in most patients. However, irrespective of the 
illumination source, the efficacy of BF-200 ALA was generally superior to the other treatments. In 
addition, the cosmetic outcome of this combination has been proven in a Phase III study with field 
therapy.  
In conclusion, BF-200 ALA in combination with red light seems an appropriate therapeutic option for 
PDT in subjects with AK lesions on the face and scalp. It can be applied in field-directed PDT and 
overcomes disadvantages of presently available preparations concerning stability of ALA and 
absorption to the lesions. Overall BF-200 ALA appears to be rather safe and well tolerated in the 
photodynamic therapy of AK lesions on face and scalp with the exception of expected transient local 
skin reactions.

AK-CT007. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet and to bring section 6.6 
of the SmPC in line with the latest QRD template. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a serious and potentially life-threatening, genetically determined 
disease of dysregulation of the contact activation pathway (Kaplan and Joseph 2014). HAE is 
characterized clinically by recurrent episodes of angioedema of the skin, pharynx, larynx, 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, genitals, and extremities (attacks) (Longhurst and Cicardi 2012).
The great majority of cases are caused by mutations in SERPINGrade 1, the gene for the major 
regulator of the contact activation pathway, complement 1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), leading to 
dysregulation of bradykinin (BK) (Cicardi and Zuraw 2018). Insufficiency of C1-INH results in 
abnormally upregulated cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) by plasma kallikrein, 
releasing BK, which mediates angioedema (Kaplan and Joseph 2014).
The applicant proposes that Orladeyo is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of 
hereditary angioedema in patients aged 12 years and older.
2.1.1.  Epidemiology 
In several European epidemiology studies, the prevalence of HAE has been reported as between 1: 
64,000 and 1: 92,000 and has shown no apparent ethnic variation.
It is estimated that HAE affects approximately 0.15 in 10,000 inhabitants of the EU/EEA. Based on a 
population of 516 million, it can be estimated that there are about 8000 people currently affected with 
HAE in the EEA.
The frequency of attacks in patients not taking a prophylactic medication varies, from rarely in some to 
every few days in others, with 59% of subjects reporting at least 1 attack per month (Caballero, 
Aygoren-Pursun et al. 2014).
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 9/168
2.1.2.  Biologic features/Aetiology and pathogenesis
Hereditary angioedema is caused by mutations in the gene coding for C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), 
resulting in deficiency (HAE type I) or dysfunction (HAE type II) of C1-INH protein.
The primary inhibitor of kallikrein in plasma is the SERPIN Grade 1 gene product, C1-INH (Cicardi, Bork 
et al. 2012). C1-INH is a serine protease inhibitor that normally prevents uncontrolled contact 
activation and bradykinin (BK) production by covalently binding to and inactivating kallikrein (Patston, 
Gettins et al. 1991). Patients with C1-INH-HAE have mutations in the C1-INH gene that result in either 
a failure to produce C1-INH or the production of non-functional C1-INH (Pappalardo, Cicardi et al. 
2000). The amount of functional C1-INH produced by the unaffected allele is insufficient to control 
serine protease activity, including that of kallikrein, that is induced by even asymptomatic levels of 
vascular endothelial contact activation (Cicardi, Bork et al. 2012). As a result, even when a patient 
does not experience any symptoms, plasma  Kininogen (HK )levels may be lower than normal and BK 
is detectable (Cugno, Hack et al. 1993, Nussberger, Cugno et al. 1998, Kaplan, Joseph et al. 2002, 
Nussberger, Cugno et al. 2002, Suffritti, Zanichelli et al. 2014). During symptomatic attacks, kallikrein 
activation, HK cleavage, and BK production increase, and circulating BK levels are dramatically 
elevated (Cugno, Nussberger et al. 2003, Bork, Meng et al. 2006, Cicardi, Bork et al. 2012, Martello, 
Woytowish et al. 2012).
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
In patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency or dysfunction, 
normal regulation of plasma kallikrein activity is impaired, which leads to uncontrolled increases in 
plasma kallikrein activity and bradykinin release, resulting in HAE attacks consisting of swelling 
(angioedema), pain, and limitation of functions. 
HAE is characterized clinically by recurrent episodes of angioedema of the skin, pharynx, larynx, 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, genitals, and extremities (attacks) (Longhurst and Cicardi 2012).
Angioedema attacks may or may not be precipitated by a stimulus (such as stress, trauma, infection, 
or changes in hormonal levels with menses) and typically progress over several hours, with symptoms, 
if left untreated, subsiding gradually over the following 3 to 5 days (Zuraw and Christiansen 2011). 
Oropharyngeal and especially laryngeal swelling can be life-threatening, and the progression of 
symptoms in laryngeal attacks is more rapid than in other locations due to the anatomy of the upper 
airway (Bork, Hardt et al. 2012).
Attacks at other sites, including limbs, genitalia, face, and intestines, can be painful, disabling, and 
disfiguring. Abdominal attacks are especially painful and may result in unnecessary surgical procedures 
if HAE is not recognized as causal. HAE has a significant impact on functionality and quality of life 
(QoL).
2.1.4.  Management
The management of HAE involves both the prevention of attacks and treatment of attacks (Cicardi, 
Bork et al. 2012, Craig, Aygoren-Pursun et al. 2012, Horiuchi, Ohi et al. 2012, Zuraw, Banerji et al. 
2013, Maurer, Magerl et al. 2018).
The International World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology 
Guideline for the Management of HAE recommends that all patients be evaluated for long-term 
prophylaxis at every visit, have sufficient medication for on-demand treatment of 2 attacks, and carry 
on-demand treatment at all times (Maurer, Magerl et al. 2018).
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 10/168
As the focus of this application is prevention, a summary of approved/withdrawn treatments for the 
prevention of HAE attacks in the EU, the US, and Japan is provided below.
In spite of available medicinal products for the treatment of acute attacks, HAE still is a disorder with 
high mortality. Berotralstat is the first oral product that has been submitted for marketing 
authorisation for the prophylaxis of HAE attacks.
Type of Application and aspects on development
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. The applicant claimed that the already authorised 
therapies were associated with significant safety or tolerability concerns with long term administration 
but this was not substantiated as no direct safety data was provided. In addition, due to the clinical 
trial designs no comparison in terms of safety, tolerability or even compliance is possible between 
Orladeyo and the other approved medicinal products for the prevention of HAE attacks.
From a safety perspective it is agreed that an oral formulation does not have the administration site 
reactions associated with IV or SC injection. However, GI side effects were noted with Orladeyo which 
do not appear to be as common with other licensed therapies such as Cinryze or Takhzyro. 
Furthermore, the applicant claimed that the approved therapies are most likely reserved as a second 
line setting (i.e. not responding to other therapies), nevertheless no supporting evidence were 
provided. These claims were not agreed as the currently approved indications for Cinryze or Takhzyro 
are not restricted to patients in a second line setting.
In terms of efficacy, a statistically significant improvement was seen compared to placebo however it 
cannot be concluded that Orladeyo is more efficacious compared to other authorised medicinal 
products.

The product is available in PCTFE/PVC-Alu blisters in a carton, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance
General information
The chemical name of berotralstat is (R)-1-(3-(aminomethyl)phenyl)-N-(5-((3-
cyanophenyl)((cyclopropylmethyl)amino)methyl)-2-fluorophenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-
carboxamide dihydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula C30H26F4N6O·2HCl. It has a 
relative molecular mass of 635.48 and the structure depicted in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Active substance structure
The structure of berotralstat was elucidated by a combination of methods.
Berotralstat is an off-white hygroscopic powder, with pH dependent solubility Berotralstat 
dihydrochloride is considered a variable hydrate since the amount of water bound to the molecule is 
correlated to the environmental relative humidity
Berotralstat exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The (R)-enantiomer is 
the active isomer. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely in the specification of the starting material 
and of the active substance by isocratic RP-HPLC. 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 12/168
Polymorphism has not been observed for berotralstat. The proposed manufacturing method of 
berotralstat consistently generates only one form. Acceptable data have been provided demonstrating 
that there is no change in polymorphism during stability and when subjected to mechanical stress as 
mentioned in the pharmaceutical development section. The variable hydrate nature of the active 
substance does not impact the solid state form and the physico-chemical characteristics of the active 
substance, as demonstrated through a study
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
The active substance is synthesized using well defined starting materials  with acceptable 
specifications. Two active substance manufacturers are proposed. No reprocessing, reworking, 
recycling, regeneration, or other operations are permitted. The chemical synthetic process of 
berotralstat hydrochloride adopted at both proposed sites is the same with minor differences in the 
process parameters and some solvents; the differences, mainly due to regional availability, have been 
adequately justified. Adequate in-process controls (IPCs) applied during the synthetic steps monitor 
conversion rates, related substances and residual solvents. Two steps include process parameters 
considered to be critical. The specifications and control methods for SMs, reagents and intermediate 
products have been presented and revised during the procedure to address a MO on genotoxic 
impurities further described below; they are now considered satisfactory. Although a comprehensive 
justification for not controlling a class 1 residual solvent in the active substance specification has been 
provided, levels above the ICH limit cannot be excluded. Since the proposed omission of a non-routine 
test for this class 1 solvent, on a suitable intermediate or on the final active substance, has not been 
fully justified in line with Annexes to the Guideline for residual solvents (CPMP/ICH/283/95 Impurities), 
the applicant is recommended to include a routine test for this class 1 residual solvent in the 
specification for 2-propanol and methanol. Alternatively, batch data on 6 consecutive pilot scale 
batches or 3 consecutive industrial scale batches of the active substance, generated using a validated 
method, should be provided demonstrating that the class 1 residual solvent is not more than 30 % of 
the specified limit in the final active substance (REC 1). In addition, in the last step of the process, 
three solvents are used. These solvents can form the corresponding alkyl halides which are known to 
be potentially genotoxic. Their presence is controlled in the active substance at levels justified in line 
with ICH M7 and supported by data generated throughout the development program, including the 
batches of the active substance manufactured using the proposed commercial manufacturing process. 
Additionally, to address the MO on the control of mutagenic impurities, QSAR assessment of specified 
impurity has concluded that specified impurity is non-mutagenic (Class 5), justifying the proposed 
control limit. A QSAR assessment, in line with ICH M7, has also been carried out for a solvent used in 
the manufacture of the SM BCX9297, confirming that this solvent is non-mutagenic (Class 5) and 
hence its control, in line with ICH Q3A qualification threshold, is adequate. To address the same MO, 
new impurity limits in intermediates have been introduced and existing ones have been tightened. The 
characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and fate. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. 
Minor changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. The overall 
chemistry is unchanged; the impurity profile of batches manufactured using the proposed commercial 
process is tighter than earlier batches, confirming that the quality has been improved with the changes 
made to the process through the development program. The quality of the active substance used in 
the various phases of the development is considered to be comparable with that produced by the 
proposed commercial process.

EMA/153239/2021 
Page 13/168
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags or liners contained in 
a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) standard open-top drum that is tightly closed. The LDPE complies 
with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.
Specification
The active substance specification, includes tests for: description (in-house), identification (IR and RP-
HPLC), assay and impurities (RP-HPLC), chiral impurity (isocratic RP-HPLC), chloride content 
(potentiometric titration), water content (KF – Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition 
(Ph. Eur.), alkyl chlorides (GC), microbial quality (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies; appropriate specifications have been set and limits have been 
tightened during the procedure in line with batch data. Unspecified impurities limits are set in line with 
ICH Q3A identification threshold. Alkyl chloride limits are set in line with ICH M7, as described above.
As discussed above, although the applicant proposed not to include a limit for a class 1 residual solvent 
in the active substance specification this was not considered fully acceptable, despite the justification 
provided; REC1 is raised, recommending the applicant to fully control its presence at the level of the 
solvents used or to provide sufficient data to demonstrate its routine control can be omitted, since the 
theoretical presence of the solvent cannot be excluded
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis data from three full scale batches of the active substance from each proposed 
manufacturer are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to 
batch. 
Stability
Stability data from three production scale stability batches of active substance from each of the 
proposed manufacturers stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the 
market for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as 
those used for release and were stability indicating.
All tested parameters were within the specifications. The water content is observed to gradually 
increase with time as the material equilibrates with its environment and then remains constant after 
the equilibration point. The specification was not exceeded. The stability profile of batches from both 
sites is similar.
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months with no specific 
storage conditions when stored in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 150 mg of berotralstat (as 
dihydrochloride) as active substance. 
The hard capsule is a size 1 capsule (19.4 mm × 6.9 mm) with white opaque body imprinted with 
“150” and light blue opaque cap imprinted with “BCX”.
The function of the excipients chosen have been fully described. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, as applicable. There 
are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC.
Compatibility of the excipients with the active substance has been demonstrated. The acceptability of 
the pharmaceutical form for the intended paediatric patient population (children 12 years or older) has 
been discussed and agreed during the PIP procedure EMEA-002449-PIP02. 
The chosen QC dissolution method is considered acceptable.  
A bioequivalence study was performed showing bioequivalence between the early clinical formulation 
The primary packaging is PCTFE/PVC-Alu blisters, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. The 
material of the primary container closure systems complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure systems has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls
Berotralstat capsules manufacturing process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process, it 
has been described in sufficient detail All relevant process parameters have been included in the 
description. The critical step has been identified. 
An assessment of the powder blend uniformity and stratified content uniformity was performed. The 
three PPQ batches met the protocol acceptance criteria which supports the conclusion of content 
uniformity of the final blend and the homogeneity of the active substance content throughout the 
encapsulation process. Therefore, it is not necessary to perform blend uniformity testing during routine 
commercial manufacture. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process 
pharmaceutical form.
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Process 
validation data is provided for batches of each strength and the data indicate that the process is 
capable of reproducibly producing product of consistent quality. Bulk holding times have been validated 
and are acceptable. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing 
the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications, include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description (visual), identification (HPLC and UV by HPLC), assay and degradation products (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units by content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (in house, apparatus II), water 
Content (KF, Ph. Eur.), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).
The specification criteria meet the requirements of ICH Q6A. 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 15/168
The dissolution specification limit has been justified based on data. However, the applicant is 
recommended to review the dissolution specification in line with the principles of the reflection paper 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017) and taking into consideration the data from 10 additional 
subsequent production batches, including future process validation batches. In line with the Ph. Eur. 
2.9.3. compliance with stage S1, S2 and S3 (Ph. Eur. 2.9.3.) should be considered acceptable, and 
thus it is expected to be possible to tighten the limit to Q=80% at 15 min (REC2). The water content 
limit has been justified based on development studies and is supported by batch data. The potential 
presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental 
impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed, as requested, considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control 
measures are deemed necessary.
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis results are provided for six commercial scale batches manufactured by the proposed 
finished product manufacturer, using active substance from both suppliers, confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product
Stability data from three commercial scale batches from each manufacturer of finished product, using 
active substance from both of the proposed suppliers, stored for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for description, assay, degradation products, chiral impurity, dissolution, water 
content and microbial attributes. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No significant changes were observed in product description, assay or degradants at both long term 
and accelerated conditions. The dissolution met the specification criteria. The water content was 
observed to increase slightly over time at both the long-term and accelerated conditions, but 
eventually levelled off; it remained below the proposed specification at all time points.  
Forced degradation studies were performed to demonstrate the stability indicating ability of the HPLC 
method to separate degradants generated in berotralstat capsules during stability. The finished product 
was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances 
and Products. Berotralstat 150 mg capsules are stable after exposure to fluorescent and ultra-violet 
light.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years, without special storage conditions, 
as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4), is acceptable.
Adventitious agents
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical and pharmaceutical aspects
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The MOs linked to the 
potential presence of genotoxic impurities and nitrosamine risk evaluation have been adequately 
resolved.
At the time of the CHMP opinion, two minor quality issue, related to the control of a class I solvent in 
the active substance and to tightening the dissolution specification limits in the finished product, 
remained unsolved, having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. These points are put 
forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality development.
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development  
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:
1. The applicant is recommended to include a routine test for a class I solvent in the specification 
for 2 solvents (with limits that will ensure that the worst-case scenario contamination of the 
active substance cannot exceed 2 ppm). Alternatively, batch data on 6 consecutive pilot scale 
batches or 3 consecutive industrial scale batches of the active substance, generated using a 
validated method, should be provided demonstrating that benzene is not more than 30% of 
the specified limit. This should be completed by Q3 2021.
2. The applicant is recommended to review the dissolution specification in line with the principles 
of the reflection paper (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017) and taking into consideration 
the data from 10 additional subsequent production batches, including future process validation 
batches. In line with the Ph. Eur. 2.9.3. compliance with stage S1, S2 and S3 (Ph. Eur. 2.9.3.) 
should be considered acceptable, and thus it is expected to be possible to tighten the limit.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
2.3.2.  Pharmacology
Berotralstat (BCX7375) is a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, intended for routine 
prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years or older. 
HAE is a disorder of dysregulation of the contact activation pathway, characterized by recurrent 
episodes of tissue swelling. Plasma kallikrein is a serine protease integral to the contact activation 
pathway, it circulates in plasma as a zymogen, pre-kallikrein (PKK), bound to one of its main 
substrates, high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK). During contact activation, PKK is cleaved by 
activated factor XIIa forming the active protease kallikrein. Kallikrein in turn cleaves HK, producing 
bradykinin (BK). The activation of the BK B2 receptor by BK results in vasodilatation, increased 
vascular permeability, and smooth muscle contraction, leading to the tissue swelling that characterizes 
HAE. The great majority of cases of HAE are caused by mutations in SERPINGrade 1, leading to an 
insufficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), the major regulator of the contact activation pathway.  
This results in abnormally upregulated cleavage of HK by plasma kallikrein, releasing BK, which 
mediates angioedema. In asymptomatic HAE plasma HK levels may be lower than normal and BK is 
detectable, while symptomatic attacks are characterized by uncontrolled contact activation, with 
increased kallikrein production, HK cleavage, and dramatic increases in circulating BK. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
A limited primary pharmacodynamics package was presented in this application. It included 8 in vitro 
studies, 3 of which were conducted to develop the fluorogenic assay used to measure plasma kallikrein 
activity. 
No in vivo primary pharmacodynamics have been conducted with BCX7353. However, the in vitro data 
demonstrate that BCX7353 is a potent inhibitor of purified plasma kallikrein, with a Ki of 44nM (Study 
BR-7353-001). BCX7353 has also been shown to have acceptable selectivity for plasma kallikrein over 
other related serine proteases, with an IC50 of 0.88 nM against plasma kallikrein and IC50 ranging 
from 3967nM (against plasmin) to >50,000nM against other related serine proteases (Study BR-7353-
002). There is theoretical possibility of pharmacodynamic action with other human serine proteases, 
however, this was not tested. As serine proteases are a very broad group of enzymes, it is not possible 
to rule out inhibition of all other serine proteases in primary pharmacodynamics. From in vitro studies, 
there appeared to be no detectable clinical consequences of any such theoretical inhibition.
BCX7353 was also shown to suppress HK/PKK-dependent BK production on human endothelial cells, 
with an EC50 of 5.56nM (Study BR-7353-004), indicating that BCX7353 potently suppresses BK 
production after contact system activation by endothelial cells, supporting its proposed mode of action 
in HAE. Furthermore, BCX7353 was shown to inhibit kallikrein activity ex-vivo, in activated human 
plasma from healthy human volunteers and in monkey and rat plasma with mean EC50s of 5.4, 5.2, 
and 7.2 nM (Study BR-7353-005-REV-01), supporting the suitability of monkey and rat as the non-
clinical species used for toxicology studies. Finally, BCX7353 was shown to inhibit kallikrein activity ex-
vivo from subjects with HAE, with a range of EC50s slightly higher than in normal human plasma, 
ranging from 11.7 to 20.0 nM, and a mean EC50 of 15.9 ± 0.57 nM (Study BR-7353-006-REV-01). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies
As plasma kallikrein is an upstream regulator of the coagulation pathway, in vitro secondary 
pharmacology studies examined the effect of BCX7353 in plasma-based coagulation assays. The effect 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 18/168
of BCX7353 on prothrombin time (Study BR-7353-003) and activated partial thromboplastin time 
(Study TD-BR-18-5353-010) was evaluated in human and animal plasma from various species. PT 
doubling as a result of BCX7353 treatment was not seen at the highest concentration tested of 100 
μM, and aPTT doubling was observed at 73.4 μM, representing an estimate of > 17,000-fold and > 
12,000-fold higher than the EC50 of 5.83 nM to inhibit kallikrein activity in human plasma, respectively. 
Hence, BCX7353 was shown to prolong PT and aPTT only at very high, supra-therapeutic, drug 
concentrations, not considered relevant for human safety. In vivo secondary pharmacodynamics 
studies were not conducted.
Safety pharmacology studies
In vitro safety pharmacology studies included radioligand binding studies to assess the interaction of 
BCX7353 with 103 subtypes of GPCRs (Study AB26402). The affinity of BCX7353 for all targets was 
low, relative to the potency of BCX7353 at plasma kallikrein (0.44 nM). A Ki > 3 μM is reported for all 
GCPRs tested, with the exception of the cannabinoid CB1, melanocortin MC5, and somatostatin SST1 
receptors (Ki= 1.56, 1.92, and 2.09 μM, respectively), indicating an acceptable selectivity of at least 
3545-fold for the target enzyme. 
BCX7353 was shown to inhibit the hERG channel in vitro, with an IC50 of 0.29 μM (Study 806-125) and 
to reduce the action potential amplitude (APA), depolarize the resting membrane potential and slow 
the dV/dt max in isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers at concentration of 0.9, 9.4, and 93.7 μM (Study 
141030.CDS). Although, BCX7353 did not prolong action potential duration (APD) at concentrations up 
to 93.7µM, 300-fold greater than that required to block hERG channels, significant shortening of the 
APD is reported at 1 and 100µM concentrations. The applicant considered reductions in APA and dV/dt 
max may be due to the inhibition of hNav1.5, while depolarization of the RMP may be due to the 
inhibition of hKir2.1. BCX7353 was shown to inhibit hNav1.5 (peak) with an IC50 of 4.79 μM (Study 
150123.CDS). According to the applicant the lack of increase in APD may be due to inhibition of both 
hERG and L-type calcium channels and BCX7353 was shown to inhibit cloned human hCav1.2 in CHO 
cells with an IC50 of 1.30 μM (Study 150123.CDS). The applicant cited also literature data indicating 
that inhibition of both hERG and hCav1.2 is also a property of the antihypertensive agent, verapamil, 
which does not appear to have any propensity for Torsades de Pointes (Redfern 2003). 
However, in human cardiomyocytes, the beat period and field potential duration (a surrogate for the 
QT interval of an ECG) was increased by BCX7353 at concentrations > 0.3 μM, suggesting that 
BCX7353 has the potential to increase QT interval (Study 150217.CDS). The selectivity margin would 
be estimated to 51-fold in reference to the inhibition of kallikrein in human plasma (5.83nM).
In vivo, respiratory and CNS safety pharmacology studies conducted in the rat report a no observable 
effect level (NOEL) of 450 mg/kg, the highest dose tested, indicating that BCX7353 has a low potential 
to affect these systems (Study 806-124 and Study 806-123). A single dose of 15 mg/kg BCX7353 had 
no adverse effects on the cardiovascular system in conscious monkeys (Study 806-135). However, 
doses of 50 and 150 mg/kg decreased blood pressure (diastolic, systolic and mean) and increased ECG 
intervals, including RR, PR, QRS and QTc. Emesis/vomitus also occurred at ≥50 mg/kg, with watery 
faeces reported at 150mg/kg. 
In the monkey single-dose toxicology study (Study 806-116), the Cmax and AUC0-24 associated with a 
single dose of 150 mg/kg were 852 ng/mL and 15,600 ng.h/mL, respectively. The human exposure 
(Cmax and AUC0-24) at 150 mg, the dose for which approval is being sought, is 157 ng/mL and 2640 
ng.h/mL, respectively (Study BCX7353-112), suggesting an approximately 5-fold safety margin from 
the exposure reported at the NOAEL in monkeys to the anticipated clinical exposure. Furthermore, in a 
chronic repeat-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, 80 mg/kg/day BCX7353 administered 
for 39 weeks had no effects on ECG parameters, with a Cmax and AUC0-24 following 39 weeks of dosing 
of 692 ng/mL and 13,500 ng.h/mL, respectively (Study 806-162). Hence, the in vitro and in vivo 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 19/168
safety pharmacology data identify the cardiovascular system as a target organ for toxicity but no ECG 
findings are reported from the chronic repeat-dose toxicology study in monkeys. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics
The non-clinical pharmacokinetics of BCX7353 was studied in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, the 
species used in the general and reproductive toxicology studies, and carcinogenicity studies. Several 
studies to evaluate the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion were conducted using 
[14C]BCX7353. 
Absorption 
Pharmacokinetic parameters reported following single oral dosing of [14C] BCX7353 (radiolabel A) in 
Wistar Han (WH) rats, demonstrate that BCX7353 was efficiently absorbed, with a time to maximum 
concentration (Tmax) of 2 hours. Terminal elimination was slow with a mean t1/2 of 18.5 hours. The 
oral bioavailability (F) relative to an IV dose was estimated to be 33%. Similarly, in cynomolgous 
monkeys oral doses of BCX7353 were absorbed with a Tmax of 2 to 6 hours. Terminal elimination was 
slow with a mean t1/2 of 22.7 hours. The oral F relative to an IV dose was estimated to be 45%. In PK 
studies in albino Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats and cynomolgus monkeys, using [14C] BCX7353 with 
radiolabel B, the fraction absorbed was 62% and 52% in rats and monkeys, respectively. 
The PK of BCX7353 following repeat dosing was evaluated as part of the general and reproductive 
toxicity studies in mice, rats, pregnant rats, pregnant rabbits, and monkeys. In mice and monkeys, 
there was no evidence of a sex difference in BCX7353 exposure (Cmax or AUC0-24). In 28-day and 
13-week studies in rats the data suggested Cmax and AUC0-24 were greater in females than in males. 
However, in the 26-week rat study and the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, no sex differences were 
observed. Accumulation was evident following repeat dosing in rats and pregnant rabbits, but not in 
mice or monkeys, with the exception of systemic exposure reported for the 2 highest doses of 
55mg/kg/day and 80mg/kg/day in the chronic monkey toxicity study which showed evidence of 
accumulation. 
Placental transfer of BCX7353 was demonstrated in pregnant rats and rabbits with a Cmax in foetal 
plasma of 4% to 7%, and 7% to 11%, of the maternal plasma Cmax in rats and rabbits, respectively. 
Exposure due to breast milk was evaluated in rats; the Cmax of BCX7353 in pup plasma on lactation 
day (LD) 14 was < 5% of the maternal plasma Cmax.
Distribution
The in vitro plasma protein binding of BCX7353 (3μM) was determined to be 98.7%, 98.9%, 99.4%, 
74.1%, and 81.9% in human, rat, mouse, monkey, and rabbit plasma, respectively. Although, the 
applicant indicated that the values in monkey and rabbit plasma may be underestimated due to 
instability of BCX7353 in these matrices. The in vitro red blood cell (RBC) to plasma partitioning 
(KRBC/P) for BCX7353 was estimated in human, rat, mouse, monkey, and rabbit blood. BCX7353 has 
roughly similar affinities for RBCs and plasma proteins in human, rat, and rabbit (as defined by KRBC/P > 
1 but < 2), whereas in mouse and monkey blood there appears to be a relatively lower uptake into red 
cells (KRBC/P < 0.5).
A mass balance and distribution study was performed in albino male WH rats and pigmented Long-
Evans (LE) rats following a single oral dose (30 mg/kg) of [14C]BCX7353 (radiolabel A). After oral 
dosing to WH rats, the radioactivity was widely distributed to all tissues by the first collection time 
point (0.5 hours post dose) and most of the tissues reached maximum radioactive concentrations by 
the 8-hour time point. The tissues showing the highest maximum concentrations of radioactivity 
included liver, kidney medulla, spleen, adrenal gland(s), kidney(s), lungs, and pituitary gland.
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 20/168
Similarly, in male pigmented LE rats, radioactivity was also widely distributed to all tissues by the first 
collection time point (1-hour post dose) and most of the tissues reached the maximum radioactive 
concentrations by the 8-hour time point. At 1440 hours post-dose, the highest concentration of 
radioactivity was quantified in the uveal tract of the eye, suggesting [14C] BCX7353-derived 
radioactivity bound to melanin. However, the possibility of accumulation of BCX7353 in the eye 
associated with melanin binding was not considered relevant for human safety on the basis that there 
were no microscopic or ophthalmological effects reported in the eyes of rats or monkeys from the 
chronic repeat-dose toxicity studies. In addition, BCX7353 was not cytotoxic in the mouse fibroblast 
assay in the absence or presence of ultraviolet radiation.
Low levels of radioactivity were detected in testes, suggesting [14C] BCX7353-derived radioactivity 
crossed the blood/testes barrier. A similar distribution pattern of radioactivity in both albino and 
pigmented rats was found in distribution studies using radiolabel B. 
Metabolism
In vivo metabolism of [14C]BCX7353 was evaluated in rats and monkeys using 2 radiolabelled forms of 
BCX7353. Following a single oral dose of BCX7353 with radiolabel A to WH rats, multiple radioactive 
peaks were observed in plasma and eleven metabolites were identified. Of these 11 metabolites, only 3 
constituted ≥ 5 % of the total radioactivity. These were unchanged BCX7353 (61% of total dose), and 
N-desmethylcyclopropyl]-BCX7353 (M3) and hydroxy-BCX7353 (M9), which were the major circulating 
metabolites contributing 13.5% and 13.0% of the total radioactivity exposure, respectively. In bile 
there were small amounts of multiple metabolites and < 0.3% of the dose was recovered as 
unchanged BCX7353; M3 and [N-desmethylcyclopropyl]-BCX7353 carboxylic acid (M5) were the 2 
most abundant metabolites in bile, accounting for 2.27% and 3.08% of the dose, respectively. 
Unchanged BCX7353 was the major component recovered in faeces, accounting for 20.7% of the dose. 
M3, M5, BCX7353-carboxylic acid (M7), and N-acetyl-BCX7353 (M8) were the abundant components 
identified in faeces, accounting for 4.55, 4.89, 6.59, and 3.45% of the dose, respectively. A low level 
of unchanged BCX7353 (0.5% of the dose) was detected in urine; M3 was the most abundant 
component in urine, accounting for 1.4% of the dose. To summarize, [14C] BCX7353 was metabolized 
in rats after oral administration via oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, dealkylation, N-acetylation, 
oxidative deamination, N-carbamoylation, and glucuronidation.
Following a single oral gavage dose of radiolabel A to monkeys, there were no quantifiable levels of 
unchanged parent BCX7353 in either individual time-point or in pooled plasma samples. 
The metabolism of BCX7353 was also evaluated in rats and monkeys using radiolabel B. In both rats 
and monkeys, the predominant metabolites identified in plasma and urine were carnitine and glycine 
conjugates of CPCA. In pooled plasma from rats and monkeys, the carnitine conjugate (M2) accounted 
for 44.9% and 41.7% of the total radioactivity in the sample, respectively, while the glycine conjugate 
(M1) was, respectively, 18.5% and 11.5% of the total radioactivity in the plasma sample. These data 
suggest N-dealkylation, cleaving the cyclopropyl ring from the purine ring is involved in the metabolism 
of BCX7353. This indicates the 14C position on radiolabel B is in a metabolically sensitive position on 
the core molecule. The signal from the radiolabelled metabolite is based on the CPCA cleavage and 
does not follow the metabolic fate of the principal part of the molecule.
In vitro metabolism of BCX7353 was slow, and thus hampered the identification of metabolites and 
metabolic pathways. In a cross-species study using cryopreserved hepatocytes, BCX7353 was stable 
for > 120 minutes in human, monkey, rat, rabbit, and mouse, suggesting no major species differences. 
In studies using human liver S9 fractions BCX7353 was also stable for > 120 minutes. When incubated 
with human cryopreserved hepatocytes for 360 minutes there was a small amount of metabolism (< 
10% loss of BCX7353). Four metabolites were isolated chromatographically; the proposed identities 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 21/168
were bio-transformational products of amide hydrolysis, N-methylation, oxidation to yield a carboxylic 
acid, N-dealkylation, glucuronidation, acetylation, or a combination thereof.
Using fresh isolated primary rat and human hepatocytes, incubations with BCX7353 for up to 24 hours 
produced 12 chromatographic peaks that could represent putative metabolites. In rat, the principle 
peaks were identified as CPCA-carnitine conjugate, [N-desmethylcyclopropanoyl]-BCX7353, hydroxy-
BCX7353, and BCX7353-aldehyde with relative abundance accounting for 3.76%, 4.56%, 2.63%, and 
3.23% of the total peak area, respectively, at 24 hours. In human hepatocytes, BCX7353-aldehyde 
and CPCA-carnitine conjugate were the most abundant components at 6 and 24 hours, respectively, 
accounting for 2.66% and 2.18% of the total peak area.
After incubation with a panel of recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes the greatest 
loss of BCX7353 was observed with CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (15.0% and 22.4% loss, respectively, of 
which approximately 10% was non-specific). Less than 10% substrate loss was observed with the 
other CYP enzymes evaluated (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8,2C9, 2C19, 2E1), and the half-lives were > 60 
minutes for each CYP. Metabolite identification following incubation with recombinant CYP2D6 and 
CYP3A4 found 9 BCX7353-related components, which were proposed to form by oxidative deamination, 
N-dealkylation, oxidation, reduction, and defluorination or a combination thereof.
Excretion
The excretion of BCX7353 was evaluated in rats and monkeys using [14C]BCX7353. Following a single 
oral dose of BCX7353 with radiolabel A in intact rats, the mean cumulative excretion of radioactivity in 
the urine and faeces was 2.5% and 94%, respectively, of the administered dose up to 168 hours. In 
bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats, 22.6% of the administered dose was recovered in bile up to 96 hours 
post dose. The excretion in monkeys was similar to rats; following a single oral dose of radiolabel A, 
4.2% and 85.3% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in urine and faeces, respectively, by 
336 hours post-dose. In both rats and monkeys, the principal component in faeces was unchanged 
BCX7353.
The excretion profiles in rats and monkeys were different using radiolabel B. Following a single oral 
dose in rats, the mean cumulative excretion of radioactivity in the urine and faeces was 41.1% and 
44.7%, respectively, and was 24.1% and 59.6% in monkeys, respectively, of the administered dose 
through 168 hours. In the urine of rats and monkeys, conjugates of CPCA were the only major 
metabolites, but in faeces of rat and monkey these conjugates were each less than 5% of the total 
radioactivity; unchanged BCX7353 was the major component. Thus, urine is the principal elimination 
pathway of the carnitine- and glycine-CPCA conjugates following N-dealkylation.
These studies indicated that faecal, biliary and urinary pathways are important for the elimination of 
BCX7353 in rats and monkeys, although there is some variability in the findings resulting from use of 
the 2 different radiolabels.
Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions
The ability of BCX7353 to inhibit CYP enzymes was evaluated in pooled human liver microsomes 
(PHLM). The IC50 of BCX7353 were < 1 μM for CYP450: CYP2C9 (0.24 μM) and CYP2C19 (0.36 μM); 
between 1 and 10 μM for CYP2D6 (2.3 μM) and CYP3A (2.5 μM with midazolam as the probe 
substrate). The IC50s against all other CYP isozymes (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2E1) were > 10 μM. Further 
studies found that BCX7353 is likely a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A but not a time-dependent 
inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1.
The induction of CYP enzymes was investigated by measuring CYP enzyme activity and messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A4/5 in cryopreserved 
human hepatocytes cultured for 3 days with BCX7353. Cultures from 3 donors were evaluated. The

highest, non-cytotoxic, concentration of BCX7353 was 2.66 μM, which caused > 2-fold increases in CYP 
enzyme activity and/or mRNA activity in at least 1 culture of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6; there was > 2-fold 
CYP3A4 mRNA activity but not CYP 3A4/5 enzyme activity. However, a BCX7353 concentration of 
0.886 μM, which is still > 200-fold higher than the worst-case concentrations expected to be in the 
hepatocytes in vivo, did not result in changes in CYP2B6 mRNA of > 20%, indicating no cause for 
concern for clinical safety with CYP2B6 substrates. Also, BCX7353 was found to be a weak to moderate 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 in clinical trials (BCX7353-102, BCX7353-112, BCX7353-115) at BCX7353 doses of 
both 350 mg and 150 mg, and appropriate wording has been included in the SmPC to recommend 
monitoring for drugs which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as cyclosporine or fentanyl. 
A series of studies evaluated BCX7353 as an inhibitor and as a substrate of key human transporters. 
BCX7353 inhibited transport by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), 
multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)1, and MATE2-K with calculated IC50s of 0.49, 12.0, 
3.53, and 4.60 μM, respectively. BCX7353 was an inhibitor of organic anion transporting polypeptide 
(OATP)1B1, organic cation transporter (OCT)2 and OATP1A2 with IC50s of 13.2, 13.3, and 11.3 μM, 
respectively. The IC50 was > 30 μM for inhibition of OATP1B3, organic anion transporter (OAT)1, 
OAT3, and OATP2B1, and > 100 μM for multidrug resistance protein (MRP)2. BCX7353 was not an 
inhibitor of the bile-salt export protein (BSEP) transporter at 10 μM. 
BCX7353 is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP but is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K.
2.3.4.  Toxicology
Single dose toxicity
Single dose toxicity is reported from the acute phase of non-GLP compliant, 7-day, dose range finding 
studies in rats (Study 806-111) and monkeys (Study 806-116). The maximum tolerated single dose in 
rats is reported as 450mg/kg, with higher dosing associated with mortality (n=3/9 females), 
treatment-related clinical signs; including decreased activity, diminished pupillary reflex, vocalization 
(females only), hunched posture, piloerection, and skin cold to the touch, and decreased body weight. 
The maximum tolerated single dose in monkeys is reported as 300mg/kg. While higher doses were 
tolerated, they were associated with extensive vomitus and emesis which may have impacted on 
exposure. Minimal, mostly reversible body weight decreases occurred after each dose and some 
reversible, minimal to mild decreases in mean arterial BP (20 to 30 mmHg) are reported in the male 
and female at 500 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity
Mice
A GLP compliant repeat dose range finding study was conducted in CByB6F1 hybrid mice (Study 
20088903) to evaluate the potential toxicity and assess the TK of BCX7353 when given orally for 5 and 
28 days. Dosing was well tolerated for 28 days at dose levels up to 50/mg/kg/day, with mortality 
observed at the high dose of 125mg/kg/day. Clinical observations prior to mortality included decreased 
activity, dehydration, and/or hunched posture, decreased mean body weight, mean body weight gain, 
and food consumption. Possible slight non-adverse test article-related decreases in leukocytes, 
lymphocytes, MCV, and MCH were noted but no target organs were identified.  The maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) was considered to be ≥ 50 and < 125 mg/kg/day, and the NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/day with 
a Cmax of 2000 ng/mL and an AUC0-24 of 21,800 ng.h/mL on Day 28. This study supports the 6-month 
carcinogenicity study conducted using transgenic mice (Study 20088905), for which a high dose of 
50mg/kg/day was chosen.
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 23/168
Rats
A 7-day dose range finding study in rats (Study 806-111) indicated that multiple doses of BCX7353 
were not tolerated at 150mg/kg/day, with mortality, clinical observations and changes in clinical and 
anatomical pathology occurring at this dose level in the study. The 7-day NOAEL in rats is reported as 
50mg/kg/day (AUC0-24hr = 15,300 ng•hr/mL; Cmax = 1060 ng/mL, on Day 7). Subsequently, a 28-day 
repeat-dose study in rats included doses up to 75mg/kg/day (Study 806-131). The results indicate that 
BCX7353 was well tolerated at dose levels up to 25 mg/kg/day, but adverse clinical effects such as 
audible or difficult breathing and hunched posture, body weight loss, decreased food consumption, 
morbidity, and mortality were observed at 75 mg/kg/day. Clinical pathology data demonstrated 
evidence of inflammation and changes secondary to hepatocellular and myocyte damage that were 
mostly observed at 75 mg/kg/day in both sexes. Adverse histopathology changes including tubular 
regeneration and vacuolation were present in the kidneys, myofiber degeneration/necrosis (heart, 
skeletal muscle, tongue, larynx, oesophagus, and the glandular stomach), and/or bile duct hyperplasia 
and degeneration/necrosis was observed in males and females at 75 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL after 
dosing BCX7353 by oral gavage for 28 days in rats is considered to be 10 mg/kg/day on the basis of 
adverse bile duct degeneration/necrosis in males and females at ≥ 25 mg/kg/day. At the NOAEL, the 
combined male and female Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 28 were 186 ng/mL and 2230 ng.h/mL, 
respectively. 
Results from the GLP-compliant 13- and 26-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats indicate that 
BCX7353 was generally well tolerated, with dosing up to 20mg/kg/day (Study 806-144 and Study 
8001291 respectively). The primary target organ for BCX7353-toxicity in rats was the liver. Bile duct 
hyperplasia was observed at the highest doses of 20mg/kg/day evaluated in 13- and 26-week studies 
but was considered non-adverse due to the limited incidence and severity, and the lack of change of 
clinical pathology parameters. The kidney was also identified as a target organ at the high dose of 
75mg/kg/day in the 28-day rat study, but kidney toxicity was not apparent in 13- or 26-week studies 
with dosing up to a maximum of 20mg/kg/day. 
A consistent finding in the sub-chronic and chronic toxicity studies was the presence of foamy/ 
vacuolated macrophages in several organs and tissues, including the liver, lung, small intestine, 
spleen, and lymph nodes, together with increased urinary concentrations of the exploratory 
phospholipidosis (PLD) biomarker, di-22:6-bis(monoacylglycerol) phosphate (BMP). Vacuolated 
macrophages and increased urinary BMP were suggestive of PLD, which was confirmed in the 13-week 
rat toxicity study using electron microscopic evaluation of the liver. Of note, a frequent clinical 
observation at higher dose levels was audible, shallow, and difficult breathing and sometimes open-
mouth breathing. In rat studies evaluating doses > 20 mg/kg/day (28-day, carcinogenicity studies) 
these clinical observations occasionally preceded moribundity and mortality. In the 26-week rat study, 
there were microscopic changes in the nasal cavity (epithelial degeneration of the nasal and olfactory 
tissue), which were consistent with local irritation secondary to gastric-related reflux. The applicant 
suggests that this irritation of the upper respiratory system is due to BCX7353 in the nasal cavity and 
not due to systemic effects of the test item. The NOAEL in the 13 and 26-week toxicity studies in rats 
was 20 mg/kg/day. At this NOAEL, AUC0-24 was 9710 ng.h/mL, which represents a safety margins of 
3.8, over the exposure in humans receiving 150 mg once daily (QD), the dose being sought for 
approval. 
Monkeys
A 7-day dose range finding study in monkeys included dosing at, 0, 10, 75 and 200mg/kg/day, with 
n=2 monkeys per sex per group (Study 806-116). There was no reported mortality but vomitus 
occurred in both sexes at 75 and 200mg/kg/day, with test-article related decreased body weight at 
200mg/kg/day in both sexes which would likely become adverse over a longer treatment duration than

Page 24/168
7 days. Reversible, minimal to mild post-dose (4 hours) decreases in mean arterial blood pressures (20 
to 30 mmHg) in one male each at 10 and 75 mg/kg/day and one female each at 10 and 200 
mg/kg/day were reported of uncertain relationship to treatment, due to the low number of animals in 
this study. There was evidence of hepatocellular and/or hepatobiliary injury in both sexes administered 
≥ 75 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL in Phase B was considered to be 75 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24hr = 7,120 ng•
hr/mL; Cmax = 369 ng/mL, on Day 7) on the basis of decreases in electrolytes associated with the 
high incidence of emesis/vomitus and inappetence at 200mg/kg/day.
Subsequently, a 28-day repeat-dose study in monkeys included daily oral doses of 0, 10, 30 and 
100mg/kg/day (Study 806-132). The results indicated the liver and kidney as primary target organs 
for toxicity. A NOAEL of 10mg/kg/day was reported on the basis of adverse liver findings at ≥
30mg/kg/day, including increases in ALT and AST that correlated with increased liver weights, 
hepatocyte vacuolation, large hepatocytes, hyperplasia of oval cells, increased mononuclear cell 
infiltrates, and increased numbers of individual necrotic hepatocytes. Other toxicity occurred as higher 
doses levels, with increased kidney weights, degeneration/regeneration of renal tubules, infiltrates of 
mononuclear cells and basophilic renal tubules, and degeneration/regeneration of skeletal muscle 
myofibers considered adverse in animals at 100 mg/kg/day. Furthermore, infiltrates in the villi of the 
small intestine were noted in males and females at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day and were considered 
adverse at 100 mg/kg/day. Follicular hyperplasia was also observed in the spleen of males at 30 and 
100 mg/kg/day, and in females at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day. Increases in spleen weights, 
hepatocyte necrosis, infiltrates in the small intestine, degeneration with regeneration of renal tubules 
and increases in ALT and AST were all noted at 30 mg/kg/day. At the NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day, the 
combined male and female mean Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 28 were 86.4 ng/mL and 1350 ng.h/mL 
respectively.
Results from a GLP-compliant 13-week repeat dose study in monkeys demonstrated administration of 
BCX7353 at 2.5, 7.5, and 20 mg/kg/day by oral gavage for 91 days was well tolerated in cynomolgus 
monkeys (Study 806-145). The only test article-related findings were increases in ALT in both sexes at 
20 mg/kg/day, and increases in the urinary PLD biomarker in both sexes at 7.5 and 20 mg/kg/day, 
both findings were considered non-adverse as they showed evidence of recovery and no microscopic 
correlates are reported. Hence, a NOAEL of 20/mg/kg/day is reported, the highest dose level 
administered. The Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 91 were 192 ng/mL and 3350 ng.h/mL, respectively at 
the NOAEL of 20mg/kg.
Two chronic 39-weeks repeat-dose studies were conducted in monkeys. In the first study (Study 
8001292) there was no toxicity at a high dose of 20 mg/kg/day. Therefore, this study was repeated 
using higher doses of 30, 55, and 80 mg/kg/day (Study 806-162). In the second 39-week study in 
monkeys BCX7353 was generally tolerated at doses up to 80mg/kg/day, with no treatment-related 
mortality reported. The liver was also a primary target organ for BCX7353-related toxicity in this 
study, and hepatocellular hypertrophy was noted, together with increases in transaminase levels. The 
maximum increases of AST and ALT were observed after 1 and 3 months of dosing and were lower 
following 39 weeks of dosing. Consistent with findings in the rat and the 28-day monkey study, the 
kidney was also a target organ at higher doses than those affecting the liver. Renal tubular hyperplasia 
and/or mononuclear cell infiltration was observed at doses ≥ 55 mg/kg/day in the 39-week study. Also 
consistent with the rat study results, in monkeys the presence of foamy/vacuolated macrophages is 
also reported in several organs and tissues, including the liver, lung, small intestine, spleen, and lymph 
nodes, together with increased urinary concentrations of the exploratory PLD biomarker, di-22:6-
bis(monoacylglycerol) phosphate (BMP), suggestive of PLD.  At higher doses evaluated in the 28-day 
studies, there was degeneration/regeneration of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle. These effects 
were not observed in 13-week or chronic toxicity studies, nor were there any changes in creatine 
kinase (CK) isoenzymes in these latter studies. The NOAEL in chronic toxicity studies in monkeys was

Page 25/168
30 mg/kg/day. At this NOAEL, the AUC0-24 was 3950 ng.h/mL, which represents a narrow safety 
margins of 1.5, over the exposure in humans receiving daily 150 mg doses of BCX7353.
Toxicokinetics 
TK data were acquired in all pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies. In rats, data from the 28-day repeat 
dose study indicate that systemic exposure increased with increasing dose in a greater than dose-
proportionate manner on Days 1 and 28. A trend towards higher exposure in females was also noted at 
lower doses only (5 to 25 mg/kg/day). Also, BCX7353 appeared to accumulate in plasma (2.18- to 
4.83-fold) following repeated administration of BCX7353 for 28 days. Similarly, TK data from the 13-
week rat study indicate that systemic exposure to BCX7353 appeared to be sex dependent. Individual 
plasma concentrations, Cmax, and AUC were generally greater in females than in males (female: male 
ratios based upon AUC0-last ranged from 1.12 to 2.42; female/male ratios based upon AUC0-24 ranged 
from 1.12 to 2.53). Following daily administration of BCX7353, AUC0-24 and Cmax increased with 
increasing dose. At the NOAEL of 20mg/kg/day, the Cmax and AUC0-24  on Day 90 (sexes combined) 
were 567 ng/mL and 11200 ng.h/mL, respectively; in males the Cmax and AUC0-24  on Day 90 were 
341 ng/mL and 6330 ng.h/mL, respectively; in females the Cmax and AUC0-24  on Day 90 were 792 
ng/mL and 16000 ng.h/mL, respectively. In the rat 26-week repeat dose study, AUC0-24 increased in a 
more than dose-proportional manner between 2.5 and 20 mg/kg. The exposure to BCX7353 on Days 
91 and 182 increased after 26 weeks of daily administration, indicating accumulation occurred. Mean 
accumulation ratios ranged from 1.73 to 8.23 on Day 91, and from 2.38 to 11.3 on Day 182 for AUC0-
24. Steady-state conditions appeared to have been reached by Day 91. However, no sex differences 
were observed for AUC0-24 in this study. Gender ratios (female: male) ranged between 0.693 and 1.95 
for AUC0-24.  
In monkeys, data from the 28-day repeat dose study indicate systemic exposure initially increased 
with increasing dose in a slightly greater than dose-proportionate manner (Day 1), but in a dose-
proportionate manner on Day 28. Systemic exposure to BCX7353 appeared to be independent of sex. 
Further, BCX7353 did not accumulate in plasma following repeated administration of BCX7353 for 28 
days. The t½ could only be determined in a limited number of animals due to insufficient data in the 
terminal elimination phase. In these animals, individual t½s ranged from 13.0 to 19.6 hours at 10 
mg/kg, 11.3 to 56.8 hours at 30 mg/kg, and 321 hours for the single animal at 100 mg/kg. At the 
NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day, the combined male and female mean Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 28 were 86.4 
ng/mL and 1350 ng.h/mL respectively. Similarly, TK data from the 13-week monkey study indicate 
that systemic exposure to BCX7353 appeared to be independent of sex. Median Tmax appeared to be 
dose-dependent and were observed at 2 hours post dose at 2.5 mg/kg on all study days, 4 hours post 
dose at 7.5 mg/kg on all study days, and 8 hours post dose at 20 mg/kg on all study days. Following 
daily administration of BCX7353, mean AUC0-24  and Cmax increased with increasing dose in an 
approximate dose-proportional manner from 2.5 to 7.5 mg/kg and in a slightly greater than dose-
proportional manner from 2.5 to 20 mg/kg on Days 1, 28, and 91. Systemic exposure to BCX7353 did 
not appear to change following repeated administration of BCX7353 for 28 or 91 days. Mean 
accumulation ratios (based upon AUC0-24) were 1.31, 0.89, and 0.95, at 2.5, 7.5, and 20 mg/kg, 
respectively, on Day 28; and 1.51, 1.03, and 1.03, at 2.5, 7.5, and 20 mg/kg, respectively, on Day 91. 
At the NOAEL of 20 mg/kg/day, the combined male and female mean Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 91 
were 192 ng/mL and 3350 ng.h/mL, respectively. 
Two chronic 39-weeks repeat-dose studies were conducted in monkeys. In the first, following dosing 
up to 20mg/kg/day, Tmax ranged between 1 and 8 hours post-dose and tended to increase with the 
increase in dose but did not increase over time. The Cmax was followed by a sustained level of 
BCX7353 where t½ was not estimable. In general, on Days 1, 91 (Week 13), 182 (Week 26), and 273 
(Week 39), the AUC0-24  increased in a dose-proportional manner. The exposure to BCX7353 on Days 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 26/168
91, 182, and 273 did not change substantially when compared with Day 1 indicating that accumulation 
did not occur. Sex-specific mean accumulations ratios ranged from 0.785 to 1.32 on Day 91, from 
0.877 to 1.30 on Day 182, and from 0.675 to 1.40 on Day 273, for AUC0-24. Steady-state conditions 
appeared to have been reached by Day 91 (Week 13), indicating there were no sex-dependent 
differences in exposure (AUC0-24). At the NOAEL of 20mg/kg/day on Day 273, a sex-averaged Cmax of 
197 ng/mL and AUC0-24 of 2880 ng.h/mL was reported. In the second chronic monkey toxicity study 
with dosing up to 80mg/kg/day, TK assessment was conducted for the test article on Days 1, 90, and 
270. Systemic exposure to BCX7353 appeared to be independent of sex. Also, systemic exposure 
(AUC0-24 and Cmax) did not appear to increase with increasing dose on Day 1; however, exposure 
appeared to increase with increasing dose in an approximately dose-proportional manner on Days 90 
and 270. Systemic exposure to BCX7353 generally did not appear to increase following repeated 
administration of BCX7353 for 90 or 270 days at 30 mg/kg, but generally appeared to increase 
following QD administration at 55 and 80 mg/kg for 90 or 270 days. At the NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day, 
the mean Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 270 (sexes combined) were 277 ng/mL and 3950 hr.ng/mL 
respectively.
In summary, TK data from the pivotal repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats indicate sex-dependent 
exposures that were higher in female rats in the 28-day and 13-week studies, although this finding 
was not replicated in the chronic rat toxicity study. A greater than dose-proportional increase in 
exposures with increasing dose was also apparent in the 28-day and 26-week rat studies, with 
evidence of BCX7353 accumulation after repeated dosing for 28 days, up to 26-weeks. However, TK 
data from all pivotal repeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys indicates that exposure to BCX7353 
was independent of sex. In monkeys, Tmax appeared to be dose-dependent and increased with 
increasing dose, ranging between 1-8 hours post-dose but exposure increased with increasing dose 
approximately dose-proportionally. Furthermore, BCX7353 did not accumulate with repeated dosing in 
the majority of pivotal monkey toxicity studies, although systemic exposure reportedly increased 
following daily administration at the 2 highest doses of 55mg/kg/day and 80mg/kg/day in the second 
chronic monkey toxicity study.
Interspecies comparison
The principal target organs in rats and monkeys are the liver and kidney. Phospholipidosis (PLD) was 
also observed in the liver via electron microscopy and suspected in the small intestine, lung, spleen, 
and lymphoid tissue at clinically relevant exposures. There were no direct toxicities associated with its 
presence and the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. These findings are included in section 
5.3 of the SmPC. 
The respiratory system is affected at higher doses and considered an indirect effect of irritant 
properties of BCX7353 in the nasal cavity following gavage-related gastric reflux, causing breathing 
related difficulties. High doses of BCX7353 in the 28-day studies were associated with findings of 
skeletal and cardiac (rat only) muscle degeneration which was not observed in longer duration studies. 
The human exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24) at 150 mg, the dose for which approval is being sought, is 
157 ng/mL and 2640 ng.h/mL, respectively (Study BCX7353-112). Hence, the safety margin based on 
exposures at the NOAELs in the chronic toxicity studies in rat (20mg/kg/day) and monkey 
(30mg/kg/day) is 3.8 and 1.5 respectively. While these safety margins could be considered acceptable 
to support berotralstat 150 mg once daily (QD) administered to humans, BCX-7353-related decreased 
survival was noted in WH rats administered 20mg/kg/day in the 104-week carcinogenicity study, with 
audible breathing, decreased body weight, and lower food consumption also observed. The amended 
pathology report indicated that the decreased survival occurring at 20mg/kg/day was not statistically 
significant, this increase in mortality was not attributed to any particular probable cause of death, with 
pituitary and uterus tumours considered the most likely cause of death in males and females at 
20mg/kg dosing respectively. In addition, deleterious effect on muscles were seen mostly in higher

doses in the repeat dose toxicity studies in rat and monkey, with 20 mg/kg considered NOAEL in study 
806-144 and 8001291 repeat-dose toxicity rat studies. 
Genotoxicity
The genotoxicity of BCX7353 has been studied with respect to gene mutations in bacteria and 
mammalian cells and chromosomal aberrations in GLP-compliant studies in-vitro and in-vivo. No 
positive findings in either in-vitro or in-vivo tests are reported with BCX7353. It is concluded that 
BCX7353 is not genotoxic.
Bacterial reverse mutation studies were also conducted with 3 drug substance impurities; BCX7611, 
BCX7499, and BCX6634. Under the conditions of the respective studies, BCX7499 and BCX6634 were 
concluded to be negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. However, BCX7611 was positive for 
the ability to induce reverse mutations at the selected locus of S. typhimurium tester strain TA98 in 
the presence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. BCX7611 is a starting material in the 
synthesis of berotralstat hydrochloride and unreacted BCX7611 is a potential impurity but a limit of 
NMT 4ppm has been set to ensure human exposure is less than the TTC of 1.5ug/day, which is 
acceptable. 
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies include a 6-month transgenic mouse study and a 2-year rat carcinogenicity 
study. In CByB6F1/Tg rasH2 Hemizygous mice, daily oral administration of BCX7353 at doses up to 50 
mg/kg for 26 weeks did not result in any treatment-related clinical signs, gross pathology findings, 
neoplastic histopathology findings, or significant effects on survival (Study 20088905). Dose-related 
statistically significant decreases in body weight gain and body weights with corresponding reductions 
in food consumption were noted at 20 and 50 mg/kg/day. Also, treatment-related non-neoplastic 
histopathology findings in the nasal cavity occurred at ≥ 8 mg/kg BCX7353 which were considered 
related to local irritant properties of BCX7353 as a result of gavage-related reflux, rather than a direct 
effect of BCX7353. 
In WH rats daily oral administration of BCX7353 was reportedly tolerated for 104 weeks at doses up to 
20 mg/kg/day (Study 806-161). A higher dose group of 60/40mg/kg/day was also included, but 
increased incidence of salivation, thin appearance, audible breathing, decreased body weight, and 
decreased food consumption were noted, leading to an increase in morbidity and mortality in this 
group. Consequently, this group was terminated at Week 28. At the highest remaining dose of 20 
mg/kg/day, decreased survival, audible breathing, decreased body weight, and lower food 
consumption were observed. The decreased survival was not attributable to a predominant cause of 
death and was not statistically significant. The decreased body weight was also considered treatment-
related but non-adverse, due to the magnitude of change (Week 53:< -10% versus control, Week 101: 
-17.6% and -13.5% less than controls, in males and females respectively).
In the uterus, a low incidence of malignant endometrial stromal sarcomas in females at 8 mg/kg/day 
(2/60 affected – 3.33%) and 20 mg/kg/day (3/60 affected – 5%) is reported. Malignant sarcomas of 
the skin were present in 3/60 (5%) of males treated with 20mg/kg/day, compared to 0/60 control 
males and this increase was statistically significant at 20mg/kg/day using the Poly-3 pairwise test for 
rare tumours (p=0.033). 
BCX7353 is not genotoxic and the applicant cites an article from the literature proposing a mechanism 
for non-genotoxic compounds to cause hemangiosarcomas in rodents, via the induction of hypoxia, 
which stimulates proliferation of new blood vessels and occasional neoplasms of blood vessels (Cohen, 
Storer et al. 2009). It is thought that gavage-related gastric reflux of BCX7353 may have led to the 
nasal epithelial degeneration, causing the breathing-related difficulties which were observed, possibly

leading to hypoxia. The applicant considered the relevance of this rodent tumour to human safety as 
unlikely. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity
The completed package of reproductive and developmental toxicity for BCX7353 includes a fertility and 
early embryonic development study in male and female rats, embryo-foetal development (EFD) studies 
in rats and in rabbits, and a pre- and post-natal development study in rats. All pivotal reproductive 
toxicity studies were GLP-compliant and were conducted in an OECD member country. The 
reproductive and developmental toxicity package did not identify any effects of BCX7353 on fertility, 
pregnancy, foetal weights, malformations, embryolethality, embryo-foetal growth or teratogenicity.
A GLP-compliant fertility and early embryonic development study was conducted in rats to evaluate the 
potential toxicity of BCX7353 on female oestrous cycle, tubal transport, implantation, and development 
of the embryo, and to detect functional effects on male fertility (Study 806-156). Daily doses of 0, 10, 
25, and 45 mg/kg/day were administered to males from 28 days prior to pairing until euthanasia on 
Day 63, dosing in females began 14 days prior to pairing and continued through GD 7. A NOAEL for 
parental toxicity of 25mg/kg/day is reported, based on adverse findings of lower terminal body 
weights, lower body weight gain, and lower food consumption in males at 45mg/kg/day. The NOAEL 
level for reproductive performance and fertility was 45 mg/kg/day, the highest dose level evaluated.
Embryo-foetal development (EFD) studies were conducted in rats and rabbits to evaluate the effects of 
BCX7353 on pregnant females and on the development of the embryo and foetus consequent to 
exposure of the female from implantation to closure of the hard palate. In the pivotal rat EFD study, 
daily doses of 0, 10, 25, and 75 mg/kg/day were administered from Days 6 to 17 post-mating (Study 
9000644). The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 25 mg/kg/day, based on adverse treatment-related 
clinical signs of decreased body weight, body weight gain and food consumption at 75mg/kg/day. 
Breathing irregularities and salivation were also reported at 75mg/kg/day. No evidence of embryo-
foetal mortality, foetotoxicity, or teratogenicity was reported at any dose level and the NOAEL for EFD 
was 75 mg/kg/day, the highest dose administered. Placental transfer of BCX7353 appeared to be 
limited in rats, as the maximum mean foetal plasma concentrations at 4 hours post-dose were 3.8%, 
7.1%, and 5.1% of the maternal Cmax at 10, 25, and 75 mg/kg/day, respectively.
In the pivotal rabbit study, daily doses of 1, 20, 20 and 100mg/kg/day were administered from post-
mating day 17 to 19 (Study 9000815). The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 50mg/kg/day, on the 
basis that the 100m/kg/day dose was poorly tolerated, with 4 pre-terminal deaths (including 2 
abortions) and adverse effects on clinical condition, body weights, and food intakes reported. 
Decreased food consumption was also noted at 50mg/kg/day but was not considered adverse, as 
values recovered after dosing and no other maternal parameters were affected. No evidence of 
embryo-foetal mortality, foetotoxicity, or teratogenicity was reported at any dose level and the NOAEL 
for EFD was 100 mg/kg/day, the highest dose administered. Placental transfer was also limited in 
rabbits. The mean concentrations in foetal plasma at 3 hours post maternal dose were 7%, 11%, and 
11% of the maternal Cmax for the 20, 50, and 100 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. 
Berotralstat crossed the placental barrier in rats and rabbits. An embryo-foetal development study 
conducted in pregnant rats administered berotralstat at exposures 9.7 times the exposure achieved 
(on an AUC basis) at the clinical 150 mg berotralstat dose revealed no evidence of harm to the 
developing foetus. A second embryo-foetal development study in a relevant non-rodent species was 
not conducted.
A pre- and postnatal development (PPND) study was conducted in rats to evaluate the possible 
adverse effects of BCX7353 on the pregnant/lactating females and on the development of the 
conceptus and the offspring following exposure of the female from implantation through weaning 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 29/168
(Study 806-157). Daily doses of 1, 10, 25 and 45mg/kg/day were administered from gestational day 
(GD) 6 to lactation day (LD) 20. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 25mg/kg/day on the basis of 
treatment-related effects at 45 mg/kg/day in the parental females, included lower gestation body 
weight gain, lower lactation body weights (LD 14 and 17), lower lactation food consumption, and lower 
F1 pup body weights at LD 14, LD 21, and PND 28. The lower pup body weights on LD 14, 21, and PND 
28 were considered adverse, but in the parental females, no effect of BCX7353 was observed on 
pregnancy rate, parturition parameters, litter size, F1 pup pre-weaning development (physical, 
sensory, reflex testing), sex ratios, survival, or clinical findings. Also, in the F1 animals retained on 
study, no effect was observed on body weights (growth or gestation), sexual maturation, clinical 
findings, behaviour (motor activity, learning, and memory), reproductive performance/fertility indices, 
GD 13 uterine implantation data, or macroscopic findings. BCX7353 was detected in the plasma from 
pups at all dose levels on LD 14, confirming that there was lactational exposure. Similar plasma 
concentrations were recorded in male and female pups at each collection interval but the maximum 
mean plasma concentrations were substantially lower (< 5%) in pup plasma relative to maternal 
plasma.
Phototoxicity
The results from the completed GLP-compliant Neural Red Uptake Phototoxicity assay in BALB/c 3T3 
mouse fibroblasts indicate that BCX7353 has no phototoxic potential (Study 20088288). Radiolabelled 
BCX7353 was found to bind to melanin-containing tissues of LE rats in a distribution study. However, 
there were no microscopic or ophthalmological effects reported in the eyes of rats or monkeys from the 
chronic repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
The predicted environmental concentration was calculated using a revised Fpen, based on the 
estimated prevalence of hereditary angioedema, giving a value of 0.00375 μg/l, which falls below the 
action limit of 0.01 μg/l.

Therefore, the applicant considered that Berotralstat is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
Following a single oral gavage dose of radiolabel A to monkeys, there were no quantifiable levels of 
unchanged parent BCX7353 in either individual time-point or in pooled plasma samples. Since these 
results were unexpected and contrary to all other evaluations, these results required further scrutiny. 
No technical issues were identified concerning the conduct of this study. However, these findings 
clearly contrast with those from several other PK, toxicology, and metabolism studies in monkeys, 
which demonstrated BCX7353 is detectable in plasma for many hours following oral dosing. This 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 30/168
finding is unexplained. According to the applicant, no errors were found with the conduct of the study. 
One of proposed explanations for lack of quantifiable systemic berotralstat is rapid first pass 
metabolism, as non-naïve animals were used in this study. However, considering unchanged 
berotralstat is found in urine samples of the same animals this is highly unlikely. The applicant 
suggests limited stability of berotralstat in monkey plasma as an explanation for the lack of unchanged 
drug in monkey plasma, possibly due to mishandling of the radiolabelled plasma samples.
Pharmacology
Berotralstat (BCX7375) is a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, intended for routine 
prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years or older. A 
limited primary pharmacodynamics package was presented and no in vivo studies were included, but 
the scientific rationale for inhibiting plasma kallikrein activity in the treatment of in HAE is accepted, 
and the in vitro proof of concept data are considered sufficient non-clinical data to support the use of 
BCX7353 in HAE. 
A complete package of safety pharmacology studies was conducted. BCX7353 was shown to inhibit the 
hERG channel in vitro, with an IC50 of 0.29 μM. Although, BCX7353 did not prolong action potential 
duration in isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers at the concentrations up to 93.7µM, 300-fold greater than 
that required to block hERG channels. However, in human cardiomyocytes, the beat period and field 
potential duration (a surrogate for the QT interval of an ECG) was increased by BCX7353 at 
concentrations > 0.3 μM, suggesting that BCX7353 has the potential to increase QT interval, albeit 
with a 51-fold selectivity margin relative to the inhibition of kallikrein in human plasma (5.83nM). 
Furthermore, decreased blood pressure (diastolic, systolic and mean) and increased ECG intervals, 
including RR, PR, QRS and QTc were reported in the vivo safety pharmacology study in conscious 
monkeys, following doses of 50 and 150 mg/kg BCX7353. The applicant did not consider these blood 
pressure and ECG effects to be adverse as the maximum increase was generally <11% vs the control 
mean. Therefore, the applicant reports a NOEL for cardiovascular safety of 150mg/kg in this study. The 
NOEL is not agreed, but 150mg/kg is accepted as the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) for 
cardiovascular effects under the conditions of this study. 
These data identify the cardiovascular system as a potential target organ for BCX7353 toxicity. 
Decreased mean arterial pressure (20 to 30 mmHg) was also identified in the 7-day repeat dose 
toxicity study in monkeys at ≥10mg/kg and reversible decreased HR and lengthened RR, QT, QTc, QRS 
were reported at 100mg/kg/day in the 4-week monkey repeat-dose study. However, no effects on ECG 
parameters are reported from the chronic repeat-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, with 
dosing up to 80 mg/kg/day BCX7353 administered for 39 weeks. 
Pharmacokinetics
The nonclinical pharmacokinetics of BCX7353 was studied in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, the 
species used in the general and reproductive toxicology studies, and carcinogenicity studies. A sex-
dependent difference in BCX7353 exposure was reported in 28-day and 13-week studies in rats, the 
data suggested Cmax and AUC0-24 were greater in females than in males. However, there was no 
evidence of a sex difference in BCX7353 exposure in mice and monkeys and the rat finding was 
inconsistent, with no sex differences observed in the 26-week rat study and the 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity study. Following repeat dosing, accumulation was observed in rats and pregnant 
rabbits, but not in mice nor monkeys, with the exception of systemic exposure reported for the 2 
highest doses of 55mg/kg/day and 80mg/kg/day in the chronic monkey toxicity study which showed 
evidence of accumulation. Hence, a potential for BCX7353 accumulation following repeated dosing is 
identified from the non-clinical pharmacokinetic data. This issue was addressed further in the clinical 
PK studies, therefore no further non-clinical queries were raised on this matter.
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 31/168
Placental transfer of BCX7353 was demonstrated in pregnant rats and rabbits  (Cmax in foetal plasma 
was 4% to 7%, and 7% to 11%, of the maternal plasma Cmax in rats and rabbits, respectively). 
Exposure due to breast milk was evaluated in rats; the Cmax of BCX7353 in pup plasma on lactation 
day (LD) 14 was < 5% of the maternal plasma Cmax. This finding is included in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of 
the SmPC which is acceptable.
In the rat mass balance and distribution study, following a single oral dose of [14C]BCX7353 (radiolabel 
A) in male pigmented LE rats, BCX7353 was found to bind to melanin-containing tissues. At 1440 
hours post-dose, the highest concentration of radioactivity was quantified in the uveal tract of the eye. 
While accumulation of BCX7353 in the eye associated with melanin binding is possible, this was not 
considered relevant for human safety on the basis that there were no microscopic or ophthalmological 
effects reported in the eyes of rats or monkeys from the chronic repeat-dose toxicity studies and 
BCX7353 was not cytotoxic in the mouse fibroblast assay in the absence or presence of ultraviolet 
radiation. 
Following a single oral gavage dose of radiolabel A to monkeys, there were no quantifiable levels of 
unchanged parent BCX7353 in either individual time-point or in pooled plasma samples. Since these 
results were unexpected and contrary to all other evaluations, these results required further scrutiny. 
No technical issues were identified concerning the conduct of this study. However, these findings 
clearly contrast with those from several other PK, toxicology, and metabolism studies in monkeys, 
which demonstrated BCX7353 is detectable in plasma for many hours following oral dosing. However, 
berotralstat is relatively unstable ex vivo in monkey plasma at room temperature and this finding may 
be the result of mishandling of the radiolabelled plasma samples. The CHMP considered that there was 
no need to explore this further.
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies indicated that BCX7353 is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19 at concentrations < 1 μM, and an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A at concentrations between 1 
and 10 μM. Further, BCX7353 is likely a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A but is not likely a time-
dependent inhibitor of other principal CYP isoenzymes. These results suggest that BCX7353 may 
interfere with the disposition of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. This issue has been addressed 
by a clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study and therefore no further non-clinical queries are raised 
on this issue. 
BCX7353 also caused a 2- to 3-fold induction of mRNA and enzyme activity of human CYPs 2B6, and 
3A4 but a lower concentration of BCX7353, (e.g. corresponding to  > 200-fold than the expected 
worst-case concentrations  in  hepatocytes in vivo), did not result in changes in CYP2B6 mRNA of more 
than 20%. The potential drug-drug interaction with CYP3A4 substrates was tested in 3 clinical trials 
and BCX7353 was found to be a weak to moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, appropriate wording for drugs 
which have a narrow therapeutic window has been included in the SmPC section 4.5.
Furthermore, BCX7353 inhibits P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, and MATE2-K , and is a substrate of P-gp and 
BCRP. The ability of BCX7353 to inhibit or act as a substrate for Pgp and BCRP has also been 
addressed in clinical DDI studies.  This information has also been reflected in SmPC sections 4.5 and 
5.2.
Toxicology
The applicant has submitted an acceptable package of toxicology studies for Orladeyo in line with the 
requirements of the respective ICH guidances. Rats and monkeys were selected as species for general 
toxicity studies, on the basis of their pharmacology and metabolism, which is acceptable.
Concerns were identified regarding the rabbit as a pharmacologically relevant species for toxicology 
evaluation of berotralstat. With regards to pharmacodynamics, kinetics and metabolism, the rabbit 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 32/168
seems to have a different pharmacologic response to berotralstat; an inhibitor of plasma kallikrein 
activity in humans, nonhuman primates and rats with half-maximal inhibition of plasma kallikrein 
observed at concentrations less than 10 nM, while in rabbit plasma, berotralstat did not inhibit 
kallikrein at concentrations less than 1000 nM. At the same time, it seems that the rabbit is the most 
sensitive species regarding prolongation of aPTT. Concentration for doubling aPTT was 9.6-10.3 μM 
while berotralstat treatment resulted in prolongation of PT and aPTT only at very high supratherapeutic 
drug concentrations in standard human plasma-based assays of coagulation (PT doubling was not 
observed at concentrations up to 100 μM [56.2 μg/mL]; aPTT doubling was observed at 73.4 μM [41.3 
μg/mL]). There is no PK data available for rabbit with the exception of the study showing the instability 
of berotralstat in rabbit plasma and the reproductive toxicity studies. In reproductive toxicity studies 
the rabbit has a substantially lower exposure than rat at the same doses (i.e. Cmax and AUC on day 
17 post-mating at 50 mg/kg – 1130 ng/ml and 20700 hr*ng/mL, respectively; while rabbit values at 
day 19 post-mating at 50 mg/kg are 266 ng/ml and 2350 hr*ng/mL), due to lower bioavailability 
and/or metabolism in plasma. Hence, in EFD studies in rabbits potential on-target effect in the dams 
may not have been assessed due to the low exposure but exposures causing some maternal toxicities 
are achieved (reduced food consumption and lower bodyweights leading to abortions), with an margin 
of 1.7 to the exposure achieved at the human 150 mg berotralstat dose. However, considering the 
inadequate pharmacological activity in rabbits, these data are considered insufficient evidence of lack 
of toxicity in non-rodent species and the rabbit data will not be included in the SmPC.
The principal target organs for BCX7353 toxicity in rats and monkeys are the liver and kidney. 
Phospholipidosis (PLD) was also observed in the liver via electron microscopy and suspected in the 
small intestine, lung, spleen, and lymphoid tissue. There were no direct toxicities associated with its 
presence and the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown, however this has been reflected in 
section 5.3 of the SmPC. The respiratory system is affected at higher doses and considered an indirect 
effect of irritant properties of BCX7353 in the nasal cavity following gavage-related gastric reflux, 
causing breathing related difficulties. High doses of BCX7353 in the 28-day studies were associated 
with findings of skeletal and cardiac (rat only) muscle degeneration. Based on the exposure in male 
and female rats at the NOAEL of 20mg/kg/day for skeletal myofibre degeneration/ necrosis, the 
applicant reported a safety margin to the clinical dose of 150mg QD of 4.5. These findings are included 
in section 5.3 of the SmPC.
Carcinogenicity
In a 6-month transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study, toxicity findings consistent with those seen in 
the repeat-dose toxicity package are reported. However, no evidence for BCX7353-related increases in 
tumours at the high dose of 50 mg/kg/day are observed. The 50mg/kg/day dose corresponding to an 
AUC0-24 and Cmax of 23,100 ng.h/mL and 2280 ng/mL in males, 31,800 ng.h/mL and 2970 ng/mL in 
females, respectively, on Day 182. The human exposure (AUC0-24 and Cmax) at 150 mg, the dose for 
which approval is being sought, is 2640 ng.h/mL and 157 ng/mL, respectively (Study BCX7353-112), 
indicating an approximately 10-fold margin from the high dose in mice to the clinical exposure 
following a 150 mg berotralstat dose on an AUC basis. This information is included in section 5.3 of the 
SmPC.
In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, a finding of malignant endometrial stromal sarcomas at 8 
mg/kg/day (2/60 affected) and 20 mg/kg/day (3/60 affected) is reported. The possibility that this is a 
BCX7353-related finding could not be ruled out, due to the low incidence of this tumour in historical 
controls and the statistical significance of this finding. In addition, malignant sarcomas of the skin were 
present in 3/60 (5%) of males treated with 20mg/kg/day, compared to 0/60 control males and this 
increase was statistically significant at 20mg/kg/day using the Poly-3 pairwise test for rare tumours 
(p=0.033). Although there were no undifferentiated sarcomas in females at 8 or 20 mg/kg/day, and 1 
of 60 control females (1.7%) were affected, there is a documents sex effect in rats, with males known 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 33/168
to be more sensitive to skin tumours. In support of this, skin neoplasms are more common in males 
than in females (Bomhard, 1992; Bomhard, 1994; Zwicker, 1992; Weber, 2017, NTP data). Hence, the 
role of berotralstat in carcinogenesis of rare malignant skin sarcomas cannot be excluded. The findings 
of malignant skin sarcoma, together with the margin of safety for these finding have been included in 
section 5.3 of the SmPC.
With regards to environmental risk, no specific studies were conducted for berotralstat, which is 
acceptable in line with the relevant guideline on environmental risk assessment 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2).
2.3.7.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects

SmPC.

Bioanalytical Methods
Bioanalytical Method Validation
LC-MS/MS based methods for the determination of BCX7353 in human plasma were validated at LGC 
and Q2 Solutionslaboratories, respectively. Additional method validation was also provided for the 
assessment of BCX7353 in urine at LGC laboratories. Analytical methods for the determination of 
BCX7353 in plasma, and associated internal standards (IS), utilised LC-MS/MS with protein 
precipitation extraction, while methods investigating urine used solid phase extraction (SPE). The % 
fraction of unbound (%fu) BCX7353 in human plasma was quantitated using a rapid equilibrium 
dialysis (RED) chamber combined with LC-MS/MS. 
The calibration curve for each method was established by a weighted (1/x2) linear regression of the 
ratio of the peak area of the analyte to that of the (IS). Linear responses in the analyte and IS ratios 
were observed in spiked calibration standards (CS) and quality control (QC) samples, respectively, for 
each method. Bioanalytical method validation reports provide data pertaining to selectivity; lower limit 
of quantification (LLOQ); characterisation of potential matrix interference; intra- and inter-assay 
accuracy and precision; dilution integrity; carryover and analyte stability. 
Back calculated CS were within ±20% of the nominal value at the LLOQ, and ±15% for all other 
concentration levels above the LLOQ, using a minimum of 6 non-zero concentration levels. Intra- and 
inter-assay precision (%CV) was acceptable for the QC sample concentrations presented (i.e. %CV for 
low, medium and high QC samples <15%, respectively). The intra- and inter-assay accuracy (percent 
relative error [%RE]) was within ±15% of the nominal values for low, medium and high QC samples 
were utilised, and within ±20% for the LLOQ. 
Bioanalytical Analysis of Samples
During the analysis of participant samples, spiked CS and QC standards were extracted to permit the 
determination of the concentration of BCX7353 and its respective IS, in addition to the assessment of 
accuracy and precision. Information pertaining to transportation, handling and storage of samples was 
provided. All samples were analysed within the established stability range following long-term storage. 
Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) was performed during assessment of BCX7353 in participant samples 
from clinical studies to ensure method reproducibility. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis (BCX7353-PPK-01)
Twelve (12) clinical studies were included in a dataset for population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of 
BCX7353. These studies included healthy subjects, subjects with HAE, and subjects with renal or 
hepatic impairment. 
The final updated model was a 3-compartment model with first-order absorption with an absorption lag 
time and linear elimination.  Body weight was included as a covariate on clearance and volume of 
distribution.  Dose was included as a covariate effect on bioavailability.  PK parameters for the final 
model are provided in Table 7.  VPC for the first 24 hours after dose is given in Figure 2.

Study BCX7353-101 (Part 1, 2 and 3)
This study was a 3-part, Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single and multiple doses of BCX7353 in healthy 
subjects of Western and Japanese origin. 
Part 1 and 3 – Single Ascending Dose in Healthy Western and Japanese Participants
The PK characteristics of single ascending oral doses of BCX7353 [10, 30, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 mg] 
were assessed in healthy Western volunteers during Part 1, and Japanese participants [100 and 500 
mg] during Part 3 of this study. All study drug was administered under fasting conditions in all parts, 
except for one cohort in Part 1 who received drug under both fasting and fed conditions. PK samples 
were collected through 96 hours post dose.
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 41/168
Cmax was reached in both Western and Japanese subjects approximately 2 to 6 hours following single 
oral doses under fasting conditions. A second peak occurred approximately 5 hours after dosing in both 
Western and Japanese participants, which coincided with the timing of a meal, suggesting that 
berotralstat may undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Berotralstat plasma concentrations then declined 
biphasically. Urinary excretion and renal clearance (CLR) of berotralstat was low with <3% of the dose 
excreted in urine as unchanged parent across dose cohorts. 
In Western participants (Part 1), Cmax ranged from 3.75 to 680 ng/mL, while AUC0-inf ranged from 
25.0 to 16800 (ng·h/mL) for 30-1000 mg doses. T1/2 was 2.75 h for the 30 mg dose, and 45.1 to 62.2 
hours for 100 to 1000 mg doses. For Japanese participants (Part 3), Cmax was 37.9 and 311 ng/mL, 
AUC0-inf was 720 and 6940 (ng·h/mL), while T1/2 was 55.6 and 45.8 for 100 and 500 mg doses, 
respectively. 
Part 2 and 3 – Multiple Ascending Doses in Healthy Western and Japanese Participants
In Part 2 and 3, participants of Western (Part 2) and Japanese (Part 3) origin were treated with either 
a 7 or 14-day course of study drug. Participants recruited in Part 2 received 125, 250 or 500 mg QD 
for 7 days, while an additional cohort received 350 mg QD for 14 days. Participants in Part 3 received 
250 mg of study drug or placebo QD for 7 days. For 7 days of fasted dosing (Parts 2 and 3 multiple 
dose), PK samples were collected for 24-hours post dose on Day 1 and for 96 hours post dose on Day 
7. For 14 days of fasted dosing (Part 2 Cohort 4), PK samples were collected for 24-hours post dose on 
Day 1 and for 120 hours post dose on Day 14.
There was approximately 3- to 5-fold accumulation in exposure in both Western and Japanese 
participants following multiple dosing over 7 or 14 days. For Western participants dosed for 7 days 
(Part 2), there was a slightly greater than dose-proportional increase in exposure (AUCtau and Cmax) 
over the 125-mg to 500-mg dose range. Steady-state conditions were achieved from 6 to 12 days post 
first dose. Geometric mean BCX7353 AUCtau and Cmax were approximately 13% and 20% higher, 
respectively, in Japanese subjects as compared to Western subjects following multiple doses of 
BCX7353 at 250 mg QD.

This Phase 1, single-dose, open-label, randomized, two-period crossover study evaluated the 
bioequivalence of 2 capsule formulations (berotralstat Phase 3 formulation [reference] and berotralstat 
commercial formulation [test]). Subjects were enrolled in either cohort 1 (110 mg berotralstat) or 
cohort 2 (150 mg berotralstat). There was a minimum 30-day washout period between treatments.
Berotralstat commercial formulation was shown to be bioequivalent to the berotralstat Phase 3 
formulation in both the 110 mg and 150 mg strengths in all PK parameters of interest; Cmax, AUC0-

Influence of Food
Study BCX7353-101 (Part 1, Cohort 4)
Participants in Part 1 of study BCX7353-101 were administered a 250 mg oral dose of BCX7353 
following an overnight fast and after consumption of a high-fat meal. There was a washout period of 
≥7 days between dosing in fed versus the fasted stated. 
Following consumption of a high-fat breakfast, BCX7353 AUC0-last and AUC0-inf increased by 19 and 
41%, respectively, compared to the fasted condition. No significant difference in mean Cmax values 
were observed.

Study BCX7353-103
This Phase 1, cross-over study evaluated the effect of a high fat meal on BCX7353 pharmacokinetics 
when administered in a novel capsule formulation. Subjects received a single dose of 1 of the following 
treatments:
Treatment B: BCX7353 blend in capsule – 300 mg (free base) following an overnight fast 
Treatment C: BCX7353 blend in capsule – 300 mg (free base) following a high-fat meal 
There was a minimum 14-day washout period between treatments.
Berotralstat exposure (Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf) was similar following administration of a single 
dose of berotralstat blend 300 mg in capsule after a high-fat meal compared with under fasting 
conditions. Although time to Cmax (Tmax) was delayed by 3 hours following the high-fat meal 
compared to fasted administration, this did not impact overall berotralstat exposure. The 90% CIs for 
all 3 PK parameters were within the bounds of 80% to 125%, indicating that there was no food effect 
on the extent of exposure with the blend capsule formulation.
Table 7: Statistical Analysis of Selected PK Parameters for BCX7353 Blend 300 mg (High 
Fat) vs. BCX7353 Blend 300 mg (Fasted) – PK Population
Metabolites of BCX7353 found in human plasma and urine were assessed qualitatively. In plasma 
samples collected from healthy subjects dosed orally once daily (QD) for multiple days with BCX7353 
at 250, 350 and 500 mg/dose, 3 metabolites were detected along with the parent molecule. The 
putative metabolites found were postulated to be formed by N-dealkylation (M3), oxidative 
deamination, hydrogenation (M9), and oxidation, or a combination thereof (M6, M7). In urine the 
predominant metabolite detected was the CPCA-carnitine conjugate (M2).
Distribution
Berotralstat has a high apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F 3123 L), which suggests tissue 
distribution. The protein binding of berotralstat in human plasma was determined to be 98.7%.
Elimination
Study BCX7353-104 (Mass Balance)
This was a phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, mass balance study to evaluate the absorption, 
metabolism and excretion of BCX7353 following administration of a single 350 mg oral dose of [14C]-
radiolabelled BCX7353 (100 μCi 14C [3.7 MBq]) to healthy male subjects (n=7). Participants remained 
on site for a minimum of 336 hours post-dose and discharged on Day 15. If insufficient radioactivity 
was recovered, participants remained on-site up to 480 hours post-dose and discharged on Day 21. 
The arithmetic mean of the total recovered radioactivity extrapolated to infinity was 88.6% (SD, 7.0; 
range, 78.3 to 97.9%). The major route of excretion of total radioactivity was via faeces. A minor 
portion of total radioactivity was excreted in urine. The arithmetic mean radioactivity recovered in 
faeces and urine was 79.4% (range 71.5 to 87.0%) and 9.2% (range 6.8 to 10.9%), respectively. 
BCX7353 was cleared in subjects via a combination of metabolism as well as excretion of unabsorbed 
parent drug. BCX7353 was the largest component of the circulating radioactivity in plasma (34% of the 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 44/168
total radioactivity) and all metabolites together accounted for 39%. In plasma, there were 8 
metabolites of berotralstat detected, 5 of which were identified based on fragmentation pattern or prior 
authentic standards. The major routes of metabolism identified in humans following oral administration 
were oxidation, oxidative deamination, hydrogenation, N-dealkylation, N-acetylation, and N-
carbamylation. No single metabolite contributed >10% of the total radioactivity exposure through 24 
hours. 
Dose proportionality
In subjects with HAE, AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau of berotralstat showed a greater than dose proportional 
increase in exposure over the 62.5 to 350 mg dose range (Table 13).
Table 8: BCX7353-203: Statistical Analysis of Dose Proportionality of berotralstat Following 
Oral Administration of berotralstat at Steady State using Power Model (PK Population)
The observed more than dose-proportional increase in exposure of berotralstat in single and multiple 
ascending dose studies is most likely explained by the saturation of the efflux transporters in the liver 
and/or intestine.
Time dependency
Berotralstat does not exhibit time-dependent PK. Accumulation in berotralstat plasma exposure with 7 
or 14 days of berotralstat dosing ranges from 3- to 5-fold, which is consistent with the observed long 
half-life (GM 67-79 hours) (Table 13).

Pharmacokinetics in the target population
Study BCX7353-203
This was a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel-group study 
to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and PD of BCX7353 in subjects with HAE. Berotralstat 
exposure as measured by Cmax and AUC in subjects with HAE was overall consistent with the 
exposure observed in healthy subjects in Study 101 following multiple daily administration for either 7 
or 14 days (Table 10). In the 125 mg dose group, 55% of subjects had trough concentrations at 
steady-state that were above the minimum target concentration of 36 ng/mL (>4 × the kallikrein EC50 
of 9 ng/mL), and 100% and 98% of subjects in the 250 and 350 mg dose groups had trough 
concentrations that were >4 × EC50, respectively. No subjects in the 62.5 mg dose group had trough 
concentrations that were >4 × EC50 at steady state.

Study BCX7353-302
This was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate 2 
dose levels of BCX7353 as an oral treatment for the prevention of attacks in subjects with HAE. 
Subjects received placebo (n=40),  berotralstat 110 mg (n=41) or berotralstat 150 mg (n=40) QD for 
24 weeks. The mean concentration of berotralstat in the berotralstat 150 mg treatment group was 94 
ng/mL (range 17.6 to 266 ng/mL), with 98% of the samples with concentrations >4 × kallikrein 
inhibition EC50 and 89% of samples with concentrations >6 × EC50. These thresholds were more 
frequently met after 150 mg QD than after 110 mg QD (for which 90% of the samples had 
concentrations >4 × kallikrein inhibition EC50 and 59% of samples had concentrations >6 × EC50).
Special populations

Impaired renal function
Study BCX7353-107
This was an open-label, single-dose PK study in adult male and female subjects with normal renal 
function and severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2; not yet on dialysis).
Subjects in Groups A and B received a single oral dose of 200 mg berotralstat:
 Group A: normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CLCR] ≥ 90 mL/min) (n=7)
 Group B: severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) not yet on dialysis (n=7)
The results of statistical comparisons showed that plasma berotralstat Cmax was approximately 39% 
higher in subjects with severe renal impairment than in matched healthy subjects, although the 90% 
CI encompassed 100%. Point estimates for the GLSM ratio in AUC between subjects with severe renal 
impairment and healthy subjects were close to unity, indicating that plasma exposure was roughly 
equivalent between the 2 groups (Table 16). 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 46/168
Table 11: Study 107: Summary of berotralstat Plasma PK Parameters (PK Population)
No statistically significant correlations were identified between berotralstat PK parameters AUC0-last, 
AUC0-inf, and Cmax vs. CLCR, although there was a trend toward lower Cmax for higher CLCR, in 
alignment with the observed increase in Cmax for subjects with severe renal impairment (Pearson 
correlation = -0.53, p = 0.06).
Subjects with severe renal impairment excreted 4-fold lower amounts of the administered dose of 
berotralstat in urine as unchanged drug than matched healthy subjects (Table 11). Subjects with 
severe renal impairment had a 5-fold lower renal clearance (CLR) than matched healthy subjects. 
However, as <3% of administered drug was excreted in the urine in matched healthy subjects, the 
lower CLR in subjects with severe renal impairment had no clinically meaningful impact on systemic 
exposure.
The berotralstat unbound fraction was similar between matched healthy subjects and subjects with 
severe renal impairment. The median unbound fraction was 1.10 and 1.15 at 1-hour post dose or 1.10 
and 0.90 at 6-hours post dose for subjects with severe renal impairment and matched healthy 
subjects, respectively.

Impaired hepatic function
Study BCX7353-108
This was a single-dose, open-label study in adult male and female subjects with normal hepatic 
function and varying degrees of hepatic impairment.
Subjects in each of the following groups received one single oral dose of 150 mg berotralstat:
Group A: normal hepatic function (n=6)
Group B: Child-Pugh A (mild hepatic impairment) (n=6)
Group C: Child-Pugh B (moderate hepatic impairment) (n=6)
Group D: Child-Pugh C (severe hepatic impairment) (n=6)
The statistical comparisons showed that plasma exposures of berotralstat in subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment were similar to those in matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. Plasma 
berotralstat Cmax was approximately 27% higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment than in 
matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function, while AUCs were roughly equivalent between 
the 2 groups. Plasma exposure of berotralstat was increased the most in subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment. Plasma berotralstat Cmax and AUC0-inf were approximately 77% and 78% higher 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 47/168
in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than in matched healthy subjects, respectively. The 
increase in plasma berotralstat Cmax and AUC0-inf were approximately 50% and 38%, respectively, 
for the combined group of moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Table 17).
Table 12: Study BCX7353-108: Statistical Comparison of Plasma berotralstat PK Parameters 
(ANOVA) – PK Population
The berotralstat unbound fraction was similar in subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared with 
matched healthy subjects while the unbound fraction was approximately 25% and 100% higher in 
subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared with matched healthy 
subjects. 
 Gender
There has been no direct comparison of PK parameters between sexes. Gender was tested as a 
covariate in the population PK model but was not found to have a significant effect on PK of 
berotralstat. No dose adjustments are needed based on gender.
 Race
The effect of race was tested as a covariate in the population PK model but was not found to have a 
significant effect on PK of berotralstat. In Study 101, the GM berotralstat AUCtau and Cmax were 
approximately 13% and 20% higher, respectively, in Japanese subjects vs. Western subjects following 
multiple doses of berotralstat at 250 mg QD (Table 18). However, there was no need for dose 
adjustments based on race or ethnicity.

Single- and Multiple-Dose Administration of BCX7353 (Parts 1,2 and 3)
 Weight
In the updated population PK model provided upon CHMP request, simulations indicated an 
approximate increase of 1.42-fold in exposure in the lower weight category (down to 40 kg) compared 
to the higher weight category (Table 19).
Table 14: Predicted GMs of PK (CV%) for 150 mg QD Dose by Population, Based on All Data
Simulations were also conducted at the extremes of weight ranges. Subjects weighing ≥35 kg would 
not be anticipated to exceed tolerable exposures with regards to potential QTcF prolongation, 
designated as 222 ng/mL for GM Cmax.
In the combined safety population for Studies 204 and 302, subjects with lower weight had higher 
exposure than those in the higher weight category. Subjects weighing ≤ 70 kg had mean 
concentrations across visits that were approximately 17% higher than subjects weighing > 87.5 kg 
across active doses, but overall there was a similar general range in concentrations across subjects in 
each group. When comparing concentrations to the coverage of the kallikrein half-maximal effective 
concentration (EC50), across the weight ranges, there was a similar percentage of subjects with 
concentrations > 4 × EC50, > 6 × EC50 and > 8 × EC50. Therefore, although there are differences in 
the mean concentrations across the weight groups, and weight is a known covariate that has been 
shown to affect exposure in the population PK model, the concentrations after a 150 mg dose are 
within the efficacious window of concentrations that were targeted for kallikrein inhibition for most 
subjects, even in the highest weight group. Further, there was no impact of weight category on either 
efficacy or safety.

 Age
Berotralstat studies have enrolled predominantly adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years. The 
population PK dataset included 19 subjects >65 years of age (up to age 74 years) and 16 adolescent 
subjects (12-17 years). Age was not included as a covariate in the final (updated) population PK 
model. No dose adjustments are needed based on age.
Interactions

In vitro
In vitro, BCX7353 inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A with IC50s ranging from 0.24 μM 
for CYP2C9 to 2.5 μM for CYP3A4. The TDI screen with BCX7353 suggests it may irreversibly inhibit 
CYP3A, but not CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. BCX7353 inhibited P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, and MATE2-K with 
calculated IC50s of 0.492, 12.0, 3.53, and 4.60 μM, respectively. There was <50% inhibition of the 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 in the presence of BCX7353. BCX7353 is a substrate of 
P-gp and BCRP. In vitro experiments in recombinant enzymes showed that the greatest loss of 
berotralstat occurred with recombinant CYP2D6 and CYP3A4; however, the rate of metabolism and 
extent of loss of parent was limited and low.

In vivo
Study BCX7353-102
This was a single-center, single-sequence, open-label drug-drug interaction study to evaluate the 
effect of BCX7353 on hepatic and intestinal CYP3A4 (midazolam IV and orally, respectively), CYP2C9 
(tolbutamide), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan) enzyme activity using probe 
substrate drugs in healthy subjects.
Each subject received the following treatments:
 Day 1: 1 mg midazolam was administered as an IV bolus simultaneously to administration of 
500 mg tolbutamide, 40 mg omeprazole, and 30 mg dextromethorphan orally.
 Day 2: a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam was administered.
 Days 3 to 9: 350 mg dose of BCX7353 was administered as the dihydrochloride salt 
(approximately equivalent to 300 mg of BCX7353 free base) once a day.
 Day 10: 1 mg midazolam was administered as an IV bolus simultaneously to administration of 
500 mg tolbutamide, 40 mg omeprazole, 30 mg dextromethorphan and 350 mg BCX7353 
orally.
 Day 11: a single oral dose of 2 mg of midazolam was administered along with 350 mg 
BCX7353.

respectively. 
Study BCX7353-115 
This was a single sequence, open-label, drug-drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of steady-
state BCX7353 150 mg QD on CYP3A4 (midazolam), CYP2C9 (tolbutamide), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), 
and CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan) enzyme activity using probe substrates in healthy subjects (18-55 
years).
All subjects received the following treatments:
 Day 1: Oral doses of 4 mg midazolam, 500 mg tolbutamide, 40 mg omeprazole, and 30 mg 
dextromethorphan
 Days 3 to 11: Oral doses of 150 mg berotralstat QD
 Day 12: Oral doses of 4 mg midazolam, 500 mg tolbutamide, 40 mg omeprazole, 30 mg 
dextromethorphan, and 150 mg berotralstat
 Day 13: Oral dose of 150 mg berotralstat
Twenty-one subjects completed the study and were included in the PK analysis dataset.
Midazolam
The GLSM ratios (90% CI) (Day 12: Day 1) for midazolam Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf were 1.45 
(1.29, 1.63), 2.24 (2.05, 2.44), and 2.22 (2.03, 2.42), respectively. The GM MR AUC0-24 was higher 
on Day 1 (0.348) compared with Day 12 (0.135). The median t1/2 was longer on Day 12 (7.52 hours) 
compared with Day 1 (5.47 hours). 
Tolbutamide
The GLSM ratios (90%CI) (Day 12/Day 1) for tolbutamide Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf were 1.19 
(1.11, 1.27), 1.73 (1.63, 1.85), and 2.02 (1.87, 2.19), respectively. The GM MR AUC0-24 was higher 
on Day 1 (0.00976) compared with Day 12 (0.00428). The median t1/2 was approximately twice as 
long on Day 12 (18.1 hours) compared with Day 1 (8.55 hours). 
Omeprazole
The GLSM ratios (90%CI) (Day 12/Day 1) for omeprazole Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf were 1.21 
(1.00, 1.47), 1.24 (1.09, 1.40), and 1.24 (1.08, 1.44), respectively. The GM MR AUC0-24 was, similar 
on Day 1 (0.800) and Day 12 (0.817). The median t1/2 was similar on Day 12 (1.2 hours) compared 
with Day 1 (1.34 hours).
Dextromethorphan
The GLSM ratios (90%CI) (Day 12/Day 1) for dextromethorphan Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf were 
2.96 (2.48, 3.55), 2.78 (2.33, 3.33), and 2.77 (2.32, 3.31), respectively. The GM MR AUC0-24 was 
higher on Day 1 (1.22) compared with Day 12 (0.339). The t1/2 of dextromethorphan was unchanged.

Study BCX7353-105
This was a single-center, fixed-sequence, open-label drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of 
berotralstat on the PK of the P-gp substrate digoxin and the BCRP substrate rosuvastatin, as well as 
the effect of the P-gp and BCRP inhibitor cyclosporine on the PK of berotralstat in healthy subjects (18-
55 years). 
Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts and received the following treatments:
Cohort 1 (berotralstat-digoxin)
 Day 1: digoxin 0.25 mg
 Days 11 to 18: berotralstat 350 mg
 Day 19: berotralstat 350 mg followed 1 hour later by digoxin 0.25 mg
 Days 20 to 21: berotralstat 350 mg
Cohort 2 (berotralstat-rosuvastatin)
 Day 1: rosuvastatin 10 mg
 Days 7 to 14: berotralstat 350 mg
 Day 15: berotralstat 350 mg followed 1 hour later by rosuvastatin 10 mg
 Days 16: berotralstat 350 mg
Cohort 3 (cyclosporine-berotralstat)
 Day 1: berotralstat 350 mg
 Day 14: single dose of cyclosporine 600 mg followed 1 hour later by berotralstat 350 mg
51 subjects completed the study (17 subjects per cohort) and were included in the PK population. 
Digoxin 
The Cmax ratio of the Day 19 to Day 1 GMs (90% CI) of digoxin was 1.58 (1.20, 2.09). The AUC0-last 
and AUC0-inf ratios of the Day 19 to Day 1 GMs (90% CI) were 1.48 (1.22, 1.79) and 1.31 (1.15, 
1.50), respectively. The t½ of digoxin was similar on Days 1 and 19. The ratio of renal clearance of 
digoxin on Day 19 compared to Day 1 was 0.89, suggesting that inhibition of P-gp by berotralstat had 
minimal impact on the overall renal elimination of digoxin. 
Rosuvastatin 
The Cmax ratio of the Day 15 to Day 1 GM (90% CI) of rosuvastatin was 0.760 (0.676, 0.854). The 
AUC0-last and AUC0-inf ratios of the Day 15 to Day 1 GMs (90% CI) were 0.802 (0.730, 0.881) and 
0.844 (0.735, 0.969), respectively. The GM t½ of rosuvastatin was similar on Days 1 and 15.
Berotralstat after dosing with cyclosporine
The Cmax ratio of the Day 14 to Day 1 GM (90% CI) was 1.25 (1.05, 1.48). The AUC0-last and AUC0-
inf ratios were 1.55 (1.40, 1.72) and 1.69 (1.50, 1.91), respectively. The GM t½ of berotralstat was 
slightly longer on Day 14. The ratio of renal clearance of berotralstat on Day 14 compared to Day 1 
was 0.84, which suggests minimal impact of potential P-gp/BCRP inhibition by cyclosporine on the 
overall renal elimination of berotralstat.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics
Mechanism of action
Berotralstat is a highly specific small molecule competitive inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein activity 
with an inhibition constant of 0.44 nM on the isolated enzyme. Berotralstat binds specifically to the 
active site of the plasma kallikrein enzyme. Berotralstat inhibits kallikrein activity in plasma samples 
obtained from healthy subjects and HAE subjects with mean EC50s of 5.4 nM (3 ng/mL) and 15.9 nM 
(9 ng/mL), respectively. Sustaining berotralstat concentrations near or greater than a target level over 
a dosing interval is expected to reduce attacks of HAE in subjects with little or no functional C1-INH, 
the endogenous inhibitor of kallikrein and ultimately, bradykinin production.
Primary pharmacology
Study BCX7353-203
A total of 70 subjects were included in the PD analysis. A dose dependent inhibition of kallikrein 
inhibition was observed with berotralstat treatment over the dose range. In subjects with HAE 
administered berotralstat 250 and 350 mg QD, mean kallikrein inhibition was sustained above 75% 
through the dosing interval, with a maximum mean inhibition of approximately 90% at Tmax. In 
subjects administered a 125-mg dose QD, maximum mean kallikrein inhibition observed was 
approximately 62%, with mean kallikrein inhibition at 24 hours of approximately 46%, whereas at 
62.5-mg dose QD, maximum mean inhibition was only about 29%, with mean kallikrein inhibition of 
8% at 24 hours, compared to −7% and −12% respectively for placebo (Figure 3). C1-INH and C4 
levels were generally stable over time and no clinically meaningful differences were observed between 
dose groups.

68% (± 33), and -21% (± 48) for the berotralstat 110 mg, berotralstat 150 mg, and placebo 
treatment groups, respectively. The proportion of subjects with >50% kallikrein inhibition averaged

150 mg treatment groups, respectively, with no subjects in the placebo group having 50% kallikrein 
inhibition. Fewer subjects had >80% kallikrein inhibition, a threshold considered to be maximal 
suppression of kallikrein activity, with the proportion of subjects with >80% kallikrein inhibition 
averaged across all visits being 2 of 41 subjects (5%) and 9 of 35 subjects (26%) for the berotralstat 
110 and 150 mg treatment groups, respectively.
Study BCX7353-301
The mean (SD) percent inhibition of plasma kallikrein for all post-baseline visits were 49% (± 28), 
63% (± 20), and -11% (± 19) for the berotralstat 110 mg, berotralstat 150 mg, and placebo 
treatment groups, respectively. The proportion of subjects with >50% kallikrein inhibition averaged 
across all visits was 2 of 6 subjects (33%) and 3 of 7 subjects (43%) for the berotralstat 110 and 150 
mg treatment groups, respectively. The proportion of subjects with >80% kallikrein inhibition at all 
visits was 0 of 6 subjects and 2 of 7 subjects (28.6%) for the berotralstat 110 and 150 mg treatment 
groups, respectively.
Secondary pharmacology
Study BCX7353-106
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study to evaluate the effects of 
berotralstat at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses and exposures on the QTc (Fridericia’s method; 
QTcF) and QTcF subintervals in healthy adult subjects.

Cohort 1 (therapeutic dose): berotralstat 150 mg (n=14) or placebo (n=6) daily × 14 days
Cohort 2 (supratherapeutic dose): berotralstat 450 mg (n=14) or placebo (n=6) daily × 14 
days
Berotralstat concentrations used for PD exposure-response (ER) modelling are provided in Table 20. 
The highest clinically relevant exposure, 240 ng/mL, was determined from the average increase in 
berotralstat exposure (1.5-fold increase in Cmax) observed in Study 108 in a combined group of 
subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment following administration of a single dose of 150 
mg berotralstat.

Relationship between ΔΔQTcF and berotralstat concentration (first co-primary endpoint)
The E-R analysis of Δ∆QTcF vs. berotralstat concentration found a statistically significant positive 
slope, 0.044 msec/(ng/mL). At 158 ng/mL, the mean estimated ΔΔQTcF was 3.4 msec (2-sided 90% 
UB 6.8 msec). At 577 ng/mL, the mean estimated ΔΔQTcF was 21.9 msec (2-sided 90% UB 29.4

msec). At the highest clinically relevant exposure of 240 ng/mL, the estimated ΔΔQTcF was 7.0 msec 
(2-sided 90% UB 10.9 msec) (Table 21).

The GM Cmax for situations of increased exposure due to intrinsic factors, as well as the extrinsic 
factor of co-administration of cyclosporine, are summarized in Table 1. The GM Cmax is below the 222 
ng/mL drug concentration that is associated with a 90% UB on ΔΔQTcF of 10 msec for severe renal 
impairment, adolescents, low body weight (40 kg), and co-administration of cyclosporine. The only 
clinically relevant exposure is in moderate to severe hepatic impairment.

Relationship between each ΔΔJ-Tpc and ΔΔTp-Te and berotralstat concentration (second co-primary 
endpoint)
The E-R analysis of the relationship between Δ∆J-Tpc and berotralstat concentration found a 
statistically insignificant, minimally positive slope, 0.010 msec/(ng/mL). For Δ∆Tp-Te there was a 
greater positive slope, 0.020 msec/(ng/mL), with borderline statistical significance (p=0.067).

At 158 ng/mL, the mean estimated ΔΔJ-Tpc was -0.6 msec (2-sided 90% UB 3.8 msec). At 577 ng/mL, 
the mean ΔΔJ-Tpc was 3.5 msec (2-sided 90% UB 16.4 msec). At the highest clinically relevant 
exposure, the mean estimated ΔΔJ-Tpc was 0.2 msec (90% UB 5.8 msec. Corresponding values for 
ΔΔTp-Te were 2.4 msec (2-sided 90% UB 5.8 msec) for 158 ng/mL, and 10.8 msec (2-sided 90% UB 
20.5 msec) for 577 ng/mL. At the highest clinically relevant exposure, the mean estimated ΔΔTp-Te 
was 4.1 msec (90% UB 8.4 msec).
Determination of the central tendency analysis (secondary endpoint)
Berotralstat LSM ΔΔQTcF and 2-sided 90% CB by dose and timepoint is shown in Figure 4. 
Determination of QTcF change findings by-timepoint, using a mixed model repeated measures 
analysis, found that on Day 14, the 2-sided 90% UB LSM ΔΔQTcFs were >10 msec at a limited number 
of timepoints for the therapeutic dose level, but at most timepoints for the supratherapeutic dose. For 
berotralstat 150 mg the maximum LSM ΔΔQTcF was 11.1 msec (2-sided 90% UB 19.2 msec) at 6 
hours post-dose on Day 14; no other timepoint LSM ΔΔQTcF exceeded 10 msec. For berotralstat 450 
mg on Day 14 at 24 hours post-dose, the maximum LSM ΔΔQTcF was 18.9 msec (overall 2-sided 90% 
UB 25.4 msec). It should be noted that this analysis was not powered based upon the enrolled subject 
numbers at each dose.

Exploratory endpoints
E-R Analysis of ΔΔHR, ΔΔPR, and ΔΔQRS and change from baseline (CFB) in heart rate (HR), PR 
interval, and QRS interval by time point.
There was no correlation between ΔΔHR and berotralstat concentrations. 
At the GM Cmax for 150mg the ΔΔPR was 4.6 msec (2-sided 90% UB 7.0 msec); the GM Cmax for 
berotralstat 450 mg, the ΔΔPR was between 14.1 and 25.2 msec; and at the highest clinical exposure 
scenario, the ΔΔPR would be between 5.0 and 11.0 msec. 
At the GM Cmax for 150mg the ΔΔQRS was 2.0 msec (2-sided 90% UB 3.5 msec); the GM Cmax for 
berotralstat 450 mg, the ΔΔQRS was between 6.6 and 11.9 msec; and at the highest clinical exposure 
scenario, the ΔΔQRS would be between 2.2 and 5.1 msec.

Categorical outliers for QTcF and incidence of emergent abnormalities in ECG morphology
Minimal outlier findings were noted. Emergent abnormal morphology findings of ectopic atrial rhythm, 
nonspecific ST changes, T wave inverted, and nonspecific T changes, were noted in a maximum of 2 
subjects for any of the findings. These were noted in subjects in both berotralstat groups but not for 
those who received placebo. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions
Based on mechanism of action, co-administration of berotralstat and lanadelumab (Takhzyro) would be 
expected to result in at least additive effects in inhibiting plasma kallikrein, without additional safety risk 
related to inhibition of plasma kallikrein. No PD interactions are anticipated with other medicinal products 
or substances.
Exposure-response analyses
Exposure-Ex Vivo Kallikrein Inhibition
Exposure-response analyses of the relationship between kallikrein inhibition and berotralstat plasma 
concentrations were conducted using data from subjects with HAE in Study 203. A high correlation 
between ex-vivo kallikrein inhibition activity and plasma concentrations of berotralstat was 
demonstrated, which were well described by a sigmoidal Emax model (R2=0.75), with a calculated 
EC50 of 11 ng/mL (Figure 5).
Figure 5: Study 203: Correlation of Plasma berotralstat Concentrations and PD Effect on 
Plasma Kallikrein (PK/PD Population)
Exposure-Attack Rate Relationship in Subjects with HAE
Using data from Study 203, the relationships between the confirmed weekly attack rate and 
berotralstat plasma exposure explored over the entire dose range (0 to 350 mg [SN]) were evaluated 
graphically. None of the berotralstat steady-state PK parameters (Cmax, AUCtau, and Ctau) appeared 
to be correlated with the confirmed attack rate. In addition, there was no correlation between the 
percent of plasma berotralstat Ctau >4× and >8× kallikrein inhibition EC50 and confirmed attack rate.
Further ER analyses were conducted with the 62.5 and 125 mg dose cohorts. As shown in Figure 6 
and Figure 7, steady-state berotralstat AUCtau and Ctau appeared to be moderately correlated with 
the confirmed attack rate in the dose range of 62.5 to 125 mg. In addition, a 125-mg dose provided a 
mean Ctau of 4.7-fold EC50, with a corresponding reduction in attacks of 70% (p<0.001) compared 
with placebo; a 62.5-mg dose provided a mean Ctau of 1.8-fold EC50, with no change in attack rate

vs. placebo (p=0.811). Thus, the results suggested that maintaining a minimum threshold 
concentration of ≥4 × EC50 or 36 ng/mL would result in clinically meaningful reductions in attacks.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Pharmacokinetics
Bioanalytical Methods
Method Validation
In general, all validation reports provide sufficient data pertaining to the appropriateness of each 
method to determine BCX7353 in both human plasma and urine. A cross validation study was 
performed to ensure there was no systematic bias in reporting of BCX7353 in plasma samples analysed 
between UK and US based testing facilities. The QC samples used during cross validation experiments 
allowed for the determination of accuracy and precision across the entire calibration range for methods 
LGC275284QB02 and 171354VJHM_BDN. 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 59/168
Bioanalytical Assessment of Samples
The bioanalytical assessment reports exhibit acceptable calibration curve and QC sample performance. 
Each analytical run included QC, blank and zero samples, respectively. 
ISR was performed for all studies, except 204 and 302 as only interim data are presented and was 
acceptable. 
Population PK analysis (BCX7353-PPK-01)
A 3-compartment model with first-order absorption with an absorption lag time and linear elimination 
provided the best fit to the data. The only covariate effects included in the updated model were body 
weight on clearance and volume of distribution, and dose on bioavailability.
The difference between the estimate of t1/2 from the population PK model and estimates from NCA 
analyses from individual studies was explained by the applicant by the very long terminal half-life of 
berotralstat (566 hours) which could not be captured by the individual studies. The half-life estimates 
from NCA analyses (80-90 hours) were likely estimates of beta half-life and not the terminal half-life, 
and these were in line between the PopPK and NCA analyses. Even though terminal half-life obtained 
by the PopPK model is long, it contributes little to the overall exposure and a third compartment is not 
a clinically significant reservoir.
The applicant provided VPCs stratified by weight using 10-kg bins. Overall, the observed percentiles 
were well within the 90%CI of the simulated percentiles, including the two lowest weight groups, which 
alleviated the concerns on the possible underprediction of Cmax in the underweight patients. 
Additionally, a plot showing observed Ctrough at steady-state vs. body weight for patients from studies 
204 and 302 did not show any relationship of the observed trough values with weight.
The applicant showed that effects of age, race and sex on CL and V were not clinically nor statistically 
significant.
Absorption

Bioavailability
Study BCX7353-101 (Part 1 and 3 – Single Ascending Dose in Western and Japanese Participants)
The applicant has appropriately investigated the PK profile following single ascending oral doses of 
BCX7353 in both Western and Japanese participants.
Cmax ranged from 3.75 to 680 ng/mL, while AUC0-inf ranged from 25.0 to 16800 (ng·h/mL) for 30-
1000 mg oral doses in Western participants. While T1/2 was 2.75 h for the 30 mg dose, it ranged from 
45.1 to 62.2 hours for 100 to 1000 mg doses. Following oral administration of 100 and 500 mg of 
BCX7353 in Japanese participants, Cmax was 37.9 and 311 ng/mL; AUC0-inf was 720 and 6940 
(ng·h/mL); while T1/2 was 55.6 and 45.8. Cmax was reached after approximately 2 to 6 hours. 
While the PK profiles are similar between cohorts, there was a trend for increased exposure in 
participants of Japanese origin. Following oral administration of a single 100 mg dose of BCX7353, Cmax 
and AUC0-inf were 66 and 84% higher, respectively, in Japanese participants. For a 500 mg dose, Cmax 
and AUC0-inf were 27 and 19% higher, respectively.  Nevertheless, this is not expected to have any 
impact on the dose recommendation.
Study BCX7353-101 (Part 2 and 3 – Multiple Ascending Doses in Western and Japanese Participants)
The applicant has appropriately assessed the plasma and urine PK profile of BCX7353 following 
administration of multiple ascending oral doses of 125, 250 and 500 mg QD over a 7 day period in 
participants from a Western origin (Part 2) and 250 mg QD for 7 days in Japanese participants (Part 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 60/168
3). The applicant has also appropriately characterised the PK profile in Western participants following 
oral administration of 350 mg of BCX7353 QD for 14 days (Part 2). 
After repeated dosing for 7 and 14 days, the accumulation ratio in BCX7353 AUCtau was approximately 
3- to 5-fold (Part 2 and 3). Accumulation is expected given the long t1/2 of approximately 67 – 79 
hours. Steady-state conditions were achieved after 6 to 12 days post first dose in Western participants 
(Part 2). 
BCX7353 exposure tended to increase in Japanese subjects following the same daily oral 
administration of 250 mg for 7 days. BCX7353 AUCtau and Cmax were approximately 13% and 20% 
higher, respectively, in Japanese subjects as compared to Western participants. 
Renal excretion of BCX7353 was low, with <4% of dose recovered after multiple doses.
Berotralstat concentration-time profiles showed double peaks, with second peak occurring 5 hours 
post-dose or 1 hour after consuming a meal. This suggests that enterohepatic recirculation occurs in 
humans.

 Bioequivalence
In Study 103, following single-dose administration, the BCX7353 API 350-mg (SN) capsule was shown 
to be bioequivalent to the BCX7353 blend 300-mg (fasted) capsule formulation in all PK parameters of 
interest; Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf.
In Study 113, berotralstat commercial formulation was shown to be bioequivalent to the berotralstat 
Phase 3 formulation in both the 110 mg and 150 mg strengths in all PK parameters of interest; Cmax, 
AUC0-72, and AUC0-inf.

Influence of Food
In Study 101, the consumption of a high-fat meal tended to increase BCX7353 AUC0-last and AUC0-inf 
by approximately 19 and 41%, respectively, relative to fasting conditions. However, the 90% CI were 
wide. There was a wash-out period of ≥7 days between feeding conditions. Given the estimated t1/2 is 
approximately 45-62 hours following administration of a single oral dose (study BCX7353-101 part 1), 
the washout period may not have been adequate.
In study 103, although Tmax was delayed by 3 hours following the high-fat meal compared to fasted 
administration, this did not impact overall berotralstat exposure. The 90% CIs for all 3 PK parameters 
were within the bounds of 80% to 125%, indicating that there was no food effect on the extent of 
exposure with the blend capsule formulation.
Overall, it is agreed that the effect of food on berotralstat PK is not clinically relevant. However, 
Orladeyo is to be administered with food to minimize gastrointestinal adverse events.
Elimination (metabolism and excretion)
In study 104 (mass balance), the amount of radioactivity recovered following administration of a single 
350 mg oral dose of [14C]-radiolabelled BCX7353 was100 μCi 14C [3.7 MBq]. The arithmetic mean of 
the total recovered radioactivity extrapolated to infinity was 88.6% (SD, 7.0; range, 78.3 to 97.9%). 
BCX7353 was shown to be eliminated via a combination of metabolism as well as excretion of 
unabsorbed parent drug. The major route of excretion of total radioactivity was via faeces 
(extrapolated arithmetic mean, 79.4% [ranging from 71.5% to 87.0%]). Renal excretion was a minor 
route of elimination, accounting for approximately 9.2% (ranging from 6.8 to 10.9%) of the total 
recovered radioactivity. Systemic metabolite exposure is unlikely to be of clinical relevance since none 
of the metabolites identified in the mass balance study accounted for >10% of parent drug exposure.
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 61/168
The applicant provided an estimation of the quantitative contribution of the different elimination 
pathways based on the amount of dose excreted per the EMA Drug Interaction Guidance 
(CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.1Corr.2**. To account for unabsorbed berotralstat in feces, due to unknown 
bioavailability in humans, percent of parent drug (17.2%) was subtracted from total amount of 
radioactivity quantified (60%). This resulted in 42.8% of remaining radioactivity quantified in feces 
was derived from metabolism. 
It is acknowledged that overall estimation of contribution might not be entirely accurate as metabolites 
can be formed by several separate pathways (e.g. metabolites M5 and M6) and there is no information 
on rate of conversion from one metabolite to another one. 
Overall, no single elimination pathway that would contribute to >25% of berotralstat elimination was 
identified that would require further evaluation.
Pharmacokinetics in the target population
In the exploratory Study BCX7353-109, through the 24 hours after a single dose of BCX7353 750 mg, 
the mean plasma concentration of BCX7353 was higher than the BCX7353 EC50 for kallikrein 
inhibition, and plasma kallikrein was measurably inhibited.
In Study BCX7353-203, steady-state PK of berotralstat in subjects with HAE were consistent with 
exposure after multiple-dose administration of the same dosing regimen in healthy subjects.
In Studies 302 and 301, HAE subjects who received berotralstat 150 mg QD consistently achieved 
higher drug concentrations and a higher proportion of subjects maintained concentrations >4 and >6 × 
EC50 than subjects who received berotralstat 110 mg QD.
Special populations
 Renal impairment
The applicant conducted a dedicated renal impairment study in subjects with severe renal impairment 
(CrCL<30 mL/min). Severe renal impairment was shown to have a modest effect on berotralstat Cmax 
and no effect on AUC. Plasma berotralstat Cmax was approximately 39% higher in subjects with 
severe renal impairment than in matched healthy subjects. 
In severe renal impairment, GM Cmax at steady-state following 150 mg QD dosing was estimated to 
220 ng/mL (1.39-fold higher than GM Cmax of 158 ng/mL in subjects with normal renal function), 
which is slightly below the threshold for concern for QT prolongation (see QT prolongation below). 
According to the applicant, underestimation of the GM Cmax,ss based on the single dose 
administration is unlikely, and it could be expected that increases in exposure would be similar at 
steady state in this population. This is not agreed. 
The applicant’s predicted Cmax,ss in subjects with severe renal impairment is based on a number of 
assumptions. One of these was that steady state was reached by Day 14 in these subjects, which has 
been justified by the applicant. A second assumption, which the applicant has not addressed, is that 
berotralstat has nonlinear or dose-dependent PK, with greater than proportional increases in exposure 
with increasing dose. Thus, the assumption that berotralstat exposure would be increased by the same 
magnitude at steady state as that following a single dose in subjects with severe renal impairment is 
questioned.
As berotralstat has not been studied in patients with ESRD requiring dialysis, the SmPC (sections 4.2 
and 5.2) has been adequately updated to recommend that berotralstat use should be avoided in these 
patients. 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 62/168
 Hepatic impairment
The applicant conducted a dedicated hepatic impairment study in subjects with varying degrees of 
hepatic impairment. 
Plasma exposures of berotralstat in mild hepatic impaired subjects were similar to those in matched 
healthy subjects. Plasma berotralstat Cmax and AUC0-inf were approximately 77% and 78% higher in 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, whilst Cmax was approximately 27% higher and AUC0-inf 
was similar in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, compared to matched healthy subjects. The 
increase in plasma berotralstat Cmax and AUC0-inf were approximately 50% and 38%, respectively, 
for the combined group (moderate and severe hepatic impairment). The applicant estimates the 
Cmax,ss to be 240 ng/mL in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, which is slightly 
above the threshold for concern for QT prolongation (see QT prolongation below). 
It is also important to note that the calculation of Cmax,ss assumes that the unbound 
(pharmacologically active) fraction of berotralstat in subjects with moderate/severe hepatic impairment 
and severe renal impairment is the same as in healthy subjects, which is not the case for hepatic 
impairment. The median unbound fractions were 1.5-1.7% and 2.35-2.4% in subjects with moderate 
and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, vs 0.9-1.2% in healthy subjects. Therefore, the risk of 
QT prolongation would be higher in subjects with moderate/severe hepatic impairment if the 
assessment was based on unbound berotralstat concentrations.
 Gender and race
It is agreed that no dose adjustments are warranted based on gender or race.
 Weight
In the population PK analysis, body weight was shown to have a significant effect on BCX7353 
exposure, with AUC predicted to vary approximately 1.4-fold across the weight range of 40 to 120 kg. 
However, there appears to be no meaningful difference in efficacy and safety between the different 
body weight groups. The applicant presented the results of simulations and adequately justified that 
patients with high body weight can be expected to achieve berotralstat concentrations sufficient for 
clinical efficacy. In addition, the applicant justified that model-predicted exposures in patients of low 
body weight are reasonably accurate. Therefore, it is agreed that dose adjustments in terms of weight 
are not required in subjects weighing 40 kg or more. The information is adequately reflected in the 
SmPC>.
 Age
A limited number of elderly and adolescent subjects were included in the clinical studies with 
berotralstat. 19 subjects (2.6%) ≥ 66 years of age were included in the Pop PK dataset, which did not 
identify age ≥ 65 years to have a clinically important impact on berotralstat exposure. 
A particular concern is that older age is a risk factor for QT prolongation. As such, Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC has been appropriately updated to include advancing age in the list of risk factors for QT 
prolongation. In addition, the SmPC has been updated to reflect that berotralstat has not been studied 
in patients >75 years.  
16 adolescent subjects (12-17 years) were included in the population PK analysis. The simulated GM 
Cmax,ss in adolescent subjects (≥40 kg) of 153 ng/mL is sufficiently below the threshold of concern 
for QT prolongation (see QT prolongation below). Berotralstat has not been studied in adolescents with 
a body weight <40 kg.

Interactions
Study BCX7353-102
The magnitude of the change in exposure of each probe substrate following co-administration with 
BCX7353 indicates significant inhibition of CYP2D6 enzyme activity (dextromethorphan), CYP2C9 
enzyme activity (tolbutamide), CYP2C19 enzyme activity (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 enzyme activity 
(IV and oral midazolam). At a daily dose of 350 mg [SN], BCX7353 would be classified as a strong 
CYP2D6 inhibitor, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 (intestinal and hepatic), CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, and 
a weak inhibitor of hepatic CYP3A4.
Study BCX7353-112
This DDI study aimed to evaluate the degree to which BCX7353 inhibits metabolism of medications 
commonly co-administered in HAE patients at the proposed dose that will be administered 
prophylactically, 150 mg QD. 
Concomitant administration of danazol (CYP3A and CYP2D6 substrate) with daily BCX7353 150 mg 
reduced danazol exposure (Cmax and AUC) by approximately 20% to 25% compared to administration 
of danazol alone. The reduction in danazol exposure with concomitant use of berotralstat is unlikely to 
be clinically meaningful. Thus, from a PK perspective, no updates to the SmPC in terms of a DDI are 
required.
BCX7353 at a daily dose of 150 mg was a mild inhibitor of amlodipine metabolism, increasing exposure 
by <2-fold. As stated in the SmPC for concomitant medicines that are predominantly metabolised by 
CYP3A4, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. cyclosporine, fentanyl). Appropriate 
monitoring and ose adjustments of these medicines may be required (see section 5.2).
BCX7353 at a daily dose of 150 mg was a mild/moderate inhibitor of desipramine metabolism, 
increasing exposure by around 2-fold. As stated in the SmPC, berotralstat is a moderate inhibitor of 
CYP2D6, increasing the Cmax and AUC of dextromethorphan by 196% and 177%, respectively, and the 
Cmax and AUC of desipramine by 64% and 87%, respectively. Concomitant administration may increase 
exposure of other medicines that are CYP2D6 substrates. Refer to the SmPC for concomitant medicines 
that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index 
(e.g. thioridazine, pimozide) or whose prescribing information recommends therapeutic monitoring 
(e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Dose adjustments of these medicines may be required (see section 
5.2).
Study BCX7353-115 
Study BCX7353-115 was a follow-up study to Study BCX7353-102 to definitively inform the drug 
interaction liability of berotralstat on CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 at the clinically relevant 
dose of 150 mg QD. 
The magnitude of the change in exposure (AUC0-last) of each probe substrate following co-
administration with berotralstat indicates that berotralstat at 150 mg daily is a moderate inhibitor of 
CYP3A4 activity as measured by midazolam metabolism (GLSM ratio of 2.2), a weak inhibitor of 
CYP2C9 activity as measured by tolbutamide metabolism (GLSM ratio < 2), a moderate inhibitor of 
CYP2D6 activity as measured by dextromethorphan metabolism (GLSM ratio of 2.8) and not an 
inhibitor of CYP2C19. 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 64/168
Study BCX7353-105
The results of this study showed that berotralstat was a mild inhibitor of P-gp. However, given 
digoxin’s narrow therapeutic range, the magnitude of the increase in exposure of digoxin seen with 
concomitant berotralstat dosing (~50%) is clinically important. Therefore, adequate monitoring of 
digoxin levels is advisable if used concomitantly with berotralstat. This is adequately reflected in the 
SmPC including also other concomitantly administered medicines that are P-gp substrates.
Cyclosporine increased exposure of a single dose of berotralstat on Day 14 compared to Day 1, with 
Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf GM ratios of 1.25 (1.05, 1.48), 1.55 (1.40, 1.72), and 1.69 (1.50, 
1.91), respectively. The SmPC includes appropriate wording that close monitoring for adverse events is 
needed if berotralstat is used concomitantly with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors. 
Berotralstat exposure may be reduced if used concomitantly with P-gp and BCRP inducers. The SmPC 
advises that cyclosporine, a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor, increased the steady state maximum 
concentration (Cmax) of berotralstat by 25% and the AUC of berotralstat by 55%. Berotralstat exposure 
may be increased with concomitant administration of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors, but no dose 
adjustment is necessary. Close monitoring for adverse events is recommended for concomitant use 
with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors.
Cyclosporine, a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor, increased the steady state maximum concentration (Cmax) of 
berotralstat by 25% and the AUC of berotralstat by 55%. Berotralstat exposure may be increased with 
concomitant administration of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors, but no dose adjustment is necessary. Close 
monitoring for adverse events is recommended for concomitant use with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors.
The applicant does not anticipate these increases in exposure to be a safety concern at the proposed 
dose of 150 mg daily since single doses of berotralstat with an interacting drug and multiple doses of 
berotralstat of 350 mg for up to 28 days were generally well tolerated and cover the exposure of the 
proposed 150 mg daily dose with the degree of interaction observed in this study. 
Pharmacodynamics
In study 203, a dose dependent inhibition of kallikrein inhibition was observed with berotralstat 
treatment over the dose range 62.5 to 350 mg QD. C1-INH and C4 levels were generally stable over 
time and no clinically meaningful differences were observed between dose groups.
Exposure-response analyses demonstrated a high correlation between ex-vivo kallikrein inhibition 
activity and plasma concentrations of berotralstat. A sigmoidal Emax model described the berotralstat 
concentration and kallikrein inhibition relationship in subjects with HAE reasonably well. Although there 
was no apparent correlation between confirmed attack rate and berotralstat plasma exposure, steady-
state BCX7353 AUCtau and Ctau appeared to be moderately correlated with the confirmed attack rate 
in the lower dose range of 62.5 to 125 mg. In addition, the results suggested that maintaining a 
threshold concentration of ≥ 4 × EC50 (36 ng/mL) will result in a reduction in attacks. 
Simulations predicted that a dose of 175 mg [SN] (equivalent to 150 mg free base) berotralstat QD 
would provide trough concentrations above 4 × EC50 in approximately 93% of patients. Therefore, 
selection of 150 mg as a second, higher active dose level in Study 302 is considered appropriate.
In studies 302 and 301, an apparent concentration-related inhibition of kallikrein inhibition was 
observed in subjects treated with berotralstat, with more subjects achieving sustained maximal levels 
(>80%) in the 150 mg treatment group compared to the 110 mg treatment group.
Thorough QT Study 106
In the exposure-response analysis, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between 
ΔΔQTcF and berotralstat concentration (p<0.001). At the therapeutic dose of berotralstat 150 mg QD 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 65/168
× 14 days, the estimated mean ΔΔQTcF was 3.4 msec (2-sided 90% UB 6.8 msec). For the 
supratherapeutic dose, at the GM Cmax of 577 ng/mL for 450 mg QD × 14 days, the estimated 
ΔΔQTcF was 21.9 msec (2-sided 90% UB 29.4 msec).
The applicant estimated the highest clinically relevant exposure to be 240 ng/mL, based on the Day 14 
(steady state) GM Cmax for berotralstat 150 mg QD from the current study of 160 ng/mL multiplied by 
an average 1.5-fold increase in Cmax seen in a combined group of subjects with moderate and severe 
hepatic impairment following administration of a single dose of berotralstat 150 mg (Study 108). At 
the anticipated highest clinically relevant exposure (240 ng/mL), the estimated mean ΔΔQTcF was 7.0 
msec and the upper bound of the 90% CI was 10.9, which is above the 10 msec threshold. Appropriate 
warnings have been included in the SmPC. 
The applicant’s predicted GM Cmax,ss in severe renal impairment was 220 ng/mL. However, this 
predicted Cmax,ss is based on a number of assumptions. The possibility of underprediction of GM 
Cmax,ss (220 ng/mL) cannot be excluded and this is of particular concern because this value is so 
close to the threshold for concern for QT prolongation (222 ng/mL). At the predicted GM Cmax,ss, the 
upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI is 9.9 msec; just 0.1 msec below the threshold that would prompt 
additional warnings in the SmPC. Overall, as the true value of Cmax,ss in subjects with severe renal 
impairment is not known, and possibly under-predicted, it is considered appropriate to be cautious. 
Therefore, the applicant’s conclusion that subjects with severe renal impairment treated with 150 mg 
QD berotralstat are not at increased risk of QT prolongation due to berotralstat exposure is not 
supported. Upon request of CHMP, the applicant included a warning in the SmPC in relation to the risk 
of QT prolongation in subjects with severe renal impairment and that it is preferable to avoid the use of 
berotralstat in these patients. If treatment is required, appropriate monitoring (e.g. ECGs) should be 
considered. 
The simulated GM Cmax,ss in adolescent and low body weight (40 kg) subjects (153 ng/mL and 183 
ng/mL, respectively) are sufficiently below the threshold of concern for QT prolongation. As 
berotralstat use is restricted to subjects weighing 40 kg or more, it is agreed that there is a low risk of 
QT prolongation in adolescents and patients with low body weight. 
There are no data for individuals with risk factors for drug-induced TdP. The SmPC recommendations 
read as follows:
“There are no data available for the use of berotralstat in patients with independent risk factors for QT 
prolongation such as electrolyte disturbances, known pre-existing QT prolongation (either acquired or 
familial), advancing age, or concomitant use of other medicinal products known to prolong the QT. It is 
preferable to avoid the use of berotralstat in these patients. If treatment is required, appropriate 
monitoring (e.g. ECGs) should be considered.”
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
All clinical pharmacology issues have been sufficiently addressed and are considered resolved. The 
SmPC adequately reflects the clinical pharmacology of berotralstat.
2.5.  Clinical efficacy
In support of the application the applicant has submitted five clinical efficacy studies of which four are 
relevant to the proposed indication i.e. the routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary 
angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older. Of these one is considered a dose finding study 
(BCX7 353-203), one a pivotal study (BCX7 353-302), and two supportive studies (BCX7 353-204) and 
(BCX7 353-301). An exploratory  study investigating the efficacy of Berotralstat in the acute treatment 
of HAE attacks was also submitted.  The primary objective of the study was “To evaluate the efficacy of

2.5.1.  Dose response study
The applicant has submitted one phase 2 study (Study BCX7353-203).
Study BCX7353-203. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel-group 
study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
BCX7353 as a preventative treatment to reduce the frequency of attacks in subjects with hereditary 
angioedema.
This was a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-part, parallel-group, dose-
response study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy of berotralstat in subjects with 
HAE (Type 1 or 2). The study was conducted at 24 sites in Europe between 11 August 2016 and 8 
August 2017.
Subjects were required to have a clinical diagnosis of HAE Type 1 or 2 as documented at any time in 
the medical records or at the screening visit by a low C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) functional level 
(Type 2) or a low C1-INH antigenic level (Type 1) as well as a documented HAE attack rate of at least 
2 HAE attacks per month for 3 consecutive months (defined as 93 days) within the 6 months prior to 
the screening visit as documented in acceptable source records.
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of once-daily prophylactic treatment 
with berotralstat at up to 5 dose levels (62.5mg, 125mg, 250mg, and 350mg daily) as measured by 
the number of attacks of HAE observed in subjects with HAE enrolled in each treatment group over a 
28 day treatment duration. 
The study had potentially 4 parts but only 3 parts were concluded. In Part 1 (n = 36) the 350mg dose 
was evaluated against placebo and subjects were randomised in a 1:1 proportion. In Part 2 there were 
3 treatment groups (n = 15): Berotralstat 125mg QD, Berotralstat 250mg QD and placebo randomised 
in 1:3:3 proportion (placebo:active:active). In part 3 there were 4 treatment groups (n = 24): 
Berotralstat 125mg QD; Berotralstat 250mg QD and Berotralstat 62.5mg QD which were randomised in 
1:3:3:3 proportions (placebo:active:active:active:active).
Results (efficacy)
A total of 86 patients were screened (adults aged under 65 years), 77 were randomized, and 75 
(97.4%) were randomized and treated. Of the 11 patients who were not enrolled in the study, 9 
subjects did not meet inclusion or met exclusion criteria. Completion rates for 28 days of dosing were 
lowest for the 350 mg dose (77.8%), compared to 250mg (93.3%), 125 mg (100%), 62.5 mg (100%) 
and placebo (95.7%).
Efficacy was assessed in the full analysis population (all those who were randomised and received at 
least 1 capsule of study drug). The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of confirmed 
(adjudicated) HAE attacks in the FAS and PP populations. The primary analysis of treatment-effect was 
performed using an ANCOVA model with the adjusted qualifying attack rate as the covariate.
In the FAS for the entire dosing period, the LSM attack rate for placebo was 0.913 per week. LSM 
differences (active − placebo) in the confirmed rate of attacks per week by berotralstat dose group 
were: −0.387 (−42.4%, p = 0.006), −0.446 (−48.9%, p = 0.003), −0.642 (−70.3%, p < 0.001) and 
−0.046 (−5.0%, p = 0.811) in the berotralstat 350, 250, 125, and 62.5 mg treatment groups, 
respectively (Table 24). Similar results were observed for the PP population over the entire and 
effective dosing periods as well as for the FAS population over the effective dosing period.

ANCOVA model includes terms of treatment and adjusted qualifying attack rate. The entire dosing interval is the date of first dose to the last dose on day 
28+24 hours, or 24 hours post last dose of the study drug, whichever is earlier.
The rate of confirmed attacks requiring treatment was a secondary endpoint. In the FAS for the entire 
dosing period LSM rates were lowest in the berotralstat 125mg group. The LSM rates per week 
requiring treatment for placebo was 0.776 per week. LSM differences (active − placebo) in the 
confirmed rate of attacks per week by berotralstat dose group were: −0.293 (−37.8%, p = 0.047), 
−0.327 (−42.1%, p = 0.040), −0.558 (−71.9%, p < 0.001) and +0.057 (7.4%, p = 0.775) in the 
berotralstat 350mg, 250mg, 125mg, and 62.5mg treatment groups, respectively (see Table 26).

ANCOVA Model included terms of treatment and adjusted qualifying attack rate.
The entire dosing period was from the date of first dose to the last dose on Day 28 + 24 hours, or 24 hours after the last dose of the study 
drug, whichever was earlier.
Pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations
There were 3 PD populations, 1 for each PD assessment (plasma kallikrein inhibition, C1-INH functional 
levels or complement component 4 (C4) levels, and BMP).
The plasma kallikrein inhibition PD population included all subjects for whom at least 1 pre-dose and 
post dose plasma kallikrein inhibition result could be estimated. This population was used for all 
analyses of plasma kallikrein inhibition.
Each of the other PD populations included all subjects with a baseline and at least 1 post dose value 
and was the primary population for the relevant PD analyses. At doses of 250 or 350 mg berotralstat, 
plasma kallikrein inhibition was maintained over the dosing interval, with maximal mean inhibition of 
approximately 90% around the median Tmax, which was sustained above the mean inhibition of 75% 
over the 24-hour dosing period Maximum mean kallikrein inhibition with 125 mg berotralstat was 
approximately 62%, with mean inhibition of 46% at 24 hours, whereas at 62.5 mg berotralstat, 
maximum mean kallikrein inhibition was only about 29%, with mean inhibition of 8% at 24 hours. 
During placebo treatment, kallikrein inhibition remained relatively stable with no significant change 
from pre-dose activity further substantiating the robustness of the assay to detect a difference.

Figure 8: BCX7353-203: Mean (± SD) Kallikrein Inhibition-Time Profiles following 
Administration of Multiple Doses of Berotralstat (Kallikrein PD Population)
None of the berotralstat steady-state PK parameters (Cmax, AUCtau, and Ctau) appeared to have been 
correlated with the confirmed attack rate. In addition, there was no correlation between the percent of 
plasma berotralstat Ctau above 4 ×and 8 ×kallikrein inhibition EC50 and confirmed attack rate. 
However, berotralstat concentrations at all dose groups were well above the measured EC50 for 
kallikrein inhibition. The results suggest that maintaining a threshold concentration of ≥ 4 × EC50 or 
35.8 ng/mL will result in clinically meaningful reductions in attacks. A 125-mg dose provided a mean 
Ctau of 4.7-fold EC50, with a corresponding reduction in attacks of 70% (p < 0.001) compared with 
placebo and a 62.5-mg dose provided a mean Ctau of 1.5-fold EC50, with no change in attack rate vs. 
placebo (p = 0.811).
Overall, all doses above 125mg had a statistically significant positive effect on the attack rate, with the 
greatest effect seen with the 125 mg dose. This is surprising given the result of PD studies which 
showed greater kallikrein inhibition for the 250mg and 350mg doses with a mean inhibition over 24 
hours of approximately 75% for the two highest doses and approximately 46% for the 125 mg dose. A 
125-mg dose provided a mean Ctau of 4.7-fold EC50, with a corresponding reduction in attacks of 70% 
(p < 0.001) compared with placebo and a 62.5-mg dose provided a mean Ctau of 1.5-fold EC50, with 
no change in attack rate vs. placebo (p = 0.811). Evidence from modelling and the results from this 
Phase 2 study suggest that maintaining a threshold concentration of ≥ 4 × EC50 or 35.8 ng/mL will 
result in clinically meaningful reductions in attacks.

2.5.2.  Main study
The main study is BCX7353 302 which was conducted in a North American and European population. 
Study BCX7353-302: A Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of two dose levels of BCX7353 as an oral treatment for the prevention 
of attacks in subjects with hereditary angioedema. 
Methods
The study had a run-in period which could last up to 56 days to establish the baseline HAE attack rates 
(i.e. the attack rate over the period from screening to first dose of study drug) and which largely 
coincided with the screening period. Randomisation occurred at D 1 at the end of the screening period 
and was required to be ≤ 10 weeks from start of the screening period. The study was further divided 
into three parts: Part 1 from Day 1 to end of Week 24 (placebo controlled, blinded evaluation of 
efficacy and safety); Part 2 from the end of Week 24 to week 48 (blinded safety evaluation of 
berotralstat) and Part 3 from Week 48 to Week 96+ (evaluation of safety of open-label berotralstat).
Efficacy was evaluated in Part 1 and the applicant is only presenting results from Part 1 as the rest of 
the study is ongoing and will be provided post approval.
Study Participants
The main inclusion criteria were:
 Males and non-pregnant, non-lactating females ≥ 18 years of age (main study) or ≥ 12 to 17 
years of age (sub-study in North America only), with a clinical diagnosis of hereditary 
angioedema Type 1 or Type 2

Patients must have been medically suited for on-demand treatment as the sole medical 
management for their HAE during the study and should have access to and ability to use 1 or 
more SOC-Rx approved by the relevant competent authority for the treatment of acute attacks 
of HAE (icatibant, plasma-derived or recombinant C1-INH, or ecallantide). 

The subject must have had ≥ 2 HAE attacks that met all of the requirements below during the 
run-in period of a maximum of 56 days from the screening visit: (a) The attacks were unique, 
which was defined as an attack that did not begin within 48 hours of the end of a previous 
attack; (b) the attacks must have either been treated, required medical attention, or been 
documented to cause functional impairment based on subject entry in the e-diary. Functional 
impairment was defined as the subject being unable to perform daily activities without 
restriction (i.e. subjects recorded that they were at least slightly restricted in their daily 
activities during their HAE attack); (c) the attacks included symptoms of swelling. Symptoms 
of swelling, in addition to visible swelling, may also have included symptoms in the 
oropharyngeal or abdominal regions that were indicative of internal swelling; 
Treatments
There were three treatment groups Berotralstat 15mg QD; Berotralstat 110mg QD and placebo all 
randomised in a 1:1:1 fashion. dose was to be taken orally QD at approximately the same time each 
day with whichever meal was typically the largest meal of the day, or up to 30 minutes after 
consuming that meal. All patients could avail of rescue treatment for HAE attacks that required 
treatment.

EMA/153239/2021 
Page 75/168
Objectives
The primary objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of prophylactic BCX7353 110 mg and 
150 mg administered QD for 24 weeks compared to placebo in subjects with HAE. Secondary 
objectives relevant to efficacy included: to assess the effects of berotralstat on HAE disease activity 
and HAE attack characteristics; to evaluate the effects of berotralstat on QoL; to characterize the PD 
effects of berotralstat.
Outcomes/endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was: the rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during 
dosing in the entire 24-week treatment period (Day 1 to time of the first dose of study drug in Part 2). 
Secondary endpoints included the following: change from baseline in Angioedema Quality of Life 
questionnaire (AE-QoL) at Week 24 (total score); number and proportion of days with angioedema 
symptoms through 24 weeks; rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during dosing in the effective 
treatment period (beginning on Day 8 through to the first dose of study drug in Part 2.
Sample size
The final sample size was to have been the maximum of either the original planned sample size (32 
per group) or the re-estimated sample size. No statistical adjustment for the final analysis was 
planned. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
Subjects were randomised on a 1:1:1 basis by means of an interactive voice response system (IXRS). 
Enrolment into treatment groups was stratified by the HAE attack rate over the period from screening 
to randomization (≥ 2 attacks per month vs. < 2 attacks per month).
This was a double-blind study throughout Part 1. As such, study drug assignment was blinded to the 
investigator, study staff, study subjects, and clinical research organization staff. During Part 1, sponsor 
employee(s) were also blinded to the treatment allocation of individual subjects, with the exception of 
sponsor staff responsible for managing clinical supplies. Employees who were not blinded to drug 
assignment had no access to any other subject-level information for the duration of the study.
statistical methods
Statistical Analysis Plan
SAP v1.0 is dated 29 January 2019 and is based on Protocol Version 2.0 dated 11 October 2018. The 
database was locked to conduct the Part 1 analysis on 9 May 2019.
The applicant highlighted a number of changes in the planned analyses in the Part 1 Interim CSR. 
Changes from protocol-specified analyses included the following:

For Part 1 analyses, the protocol stated that efficacy displays were generally to be performed 
over the entire dosing period beginning on Day 1 and effective treatment period beginning on 
Day 8. In the SAP, a reduced number of displays were selected for analysis over the effective 
treatment period.

In the protocol, the PP population was originally defined as a subset of the ITT population. It 
was redefined in the SAP as a subset of the safety population.
 Due to an error in the IXRS equation, the baseline attack rate for screening for purposes of 
stratification was slightly larger than it should have been because the denominator did not 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 76/168
include the “+1”; ie, the number of days in screening was underestimated by 1 day. For 
analysis purposes, the baseline attack rate was recalculated using the intended equation for 
baseline attack rate as shown in the SAP.


Clarified that Part 1 ends at the time of the first dose for Part 2.
The sample size per group was increased from 32 to 40 subjects to account for potential 
dropouts. Initial sample size estimates did not allow for any subject dropout.
 Due to rapid enrolment that exceeded the planned total sample size before the planned timing 
of sample size re-estimation was reached, i.e. when 50% of subjects reached Week 24, the 
planned sample size re-estimation was not conducted.
Changes from the SAP to the Part 1 analysis included:





The equation for WPAI work productivity loss in the SAP Section 6.7.6.3 was corrected (“Q10” 
was changed to “10”).
The equation for the attack rate reduction compared to placebo as specified in Section 8.6.1 of 
the SAP was multiplied by 100% and reported as a percentage reduction rather than as a 
proportion.
Analysis of PD data excluded hemolyzed samples as specified in the PD data transfer 
agreement.
Treatment compliance calculations were changed to add a calculation of compliance by visit as 
well as for Part 1 overall.
A definition of laryngeal attacks was added and the number of laryngeal events occurring 
during Part 1 were summarized. Laryngeal attacks were defined as attacks which have visible 
swelling in the mouth/tongue/lips or any of the following internal swelling symptoms: lump in 
throat (tightness), difficulty swallowing, change in voice, or difficulty breathing.

For the PP population definition, a requirement was added that a subject needed to have > 
85% overall treatment compliance based upon capsule counts to be included.
A large number of post-hoc analyses were also performed.
Analysis Populations
Subjects who gave informed written consent but were not randomized to study treatment were noted 
as screen failures in the eCRF and were considered screen failures. Reasons for screen failures were 
summarized using this population.
The ITT population included all randomized subjects, regardless of whether study treatment was 
administered. This population was the primary population for the analysis of the efficacy and health 
outcomes data. Data were analysed according to randomized treatment.
The safety population included all subjects who received ≥ 1 capsule of study drug. This population 
was used in the assessment and reporting of accountability, demographic information, berotralstat 
drug concentrations, and safety data. Data were analysed according to the actual treatment received 
at first dose.
The per protocol (PP) population included subjects in the safety population who completed Part 1. For 
study 302 subjects included in the PP population had ≥ 85% treatment compliance without any major 
protocol deviations that could impact efficacy measures. A decision was made prior to database lock on 
which subjects (if any) were excluded from the PP population based upon major protocol deviations. In 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 77/168
the PP analysis, subjects were assessed based on the actual treatment received on Day 1. The PP 
population was used as a secondary population for efficacy analyses.
The subset of subjects in the ITT population who completed Part 1 of the study comprised the 
completers population. The completers population was used for a sensitivity analysis of the primary 
efficacy analysis for Part 1 only. Data were analysed according to randomized treatment.
The PD population included all subjects for whom ≥ 1 pre-dose and 1 post dose plasma kallikrein 
inhibition result could be estimated. Data were analysed according to the actual treatment received. 
This population was used for all analyses of plasma kallikrein inhibition.
The PK/PD population included all subjects for whom ≥ 1 pre-dose and 1 post-dose plasma kallikrein 
inhibition result could be estimated with a corresponding plasma berotralstat concentration (placebo 
samples not analysed were assumed to have a 0 concentration). This population was used for plots 
comparing plasma kallikrein inhibition and plasma berotralstat concentrations.
Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary efficacy endpoint for Part 1 of the study is the rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks 
during dosing in the entire 24-week treatment period during Part 1 (Day 1 to first dose of Part 2). The 
first dose in Part 2 is expected on Day 169. The primary efficacy analysis was to conducted using the 
ITT population. The primary analysis was to be based on data from subjects who were on study 
treatment and this analysis was not to include data post treatment discontinuation.
The attack rate and the treatment comparisons between each BCX7353 dose and placebo in the
rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the Part 1 dosing period was to be analysed using a 
Poisson regression model. The number of investigator-confirmed attacks was to be included as the 
dependent variable, the treatment will be included as a fixed effect, the stratification variable (baseline 
attack rate) was to be included as a covariate and the logarithm of duration on treatment was to be 
included as an offset variable. The estimated rate of attack for each treatment group, the treatment 
differences expressed as the attack rate ratio (BCX7353 over placebo rate ratio) and their associated 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were to be provided from the Poisson regression model.
The percentage reduction from placebo was to be calculated for each dose as:
Rate Reduction = 1 -  attack rate ratio = 1 – RA/RP
where RP is the estimated attack rate for placebo treatment and RA is the estimated attack rate for 
active treatment.
As a sensitivity analysis to examine the appropriateness of the Poisson model, a negative binomial 
model was to be used in place of the Poisson regression model. If the results of the model obtained 
using the negative binomial distribution were similar to that of the model that assumes the Poisson 
distribution and a statistical test of the dispersion parameter did not show that it is significantly greater 
than zero, the Poisson model would remain as the primary model for analysis.
Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Efficacy Results – Supplementary estimands and missing data
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint based on the PP and Completers populations were to be 
conducted. A second analysis using the ITT population with subject-reported rather than investigator-
confirmed attacks was also be conducted.
In addition, there were to be 3 sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of missing data:
1. Using observed post-treatment discontinuation data where available without imputation for 
missing data. For this analysis, the attack rate was to be computed through the last date of 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 78/168
observed data up to the Part 2 treatment start date/time, including data collected after 
treatment discontinuation.
2. Observed post-treatment discontinuation data were to be used in combination with an imputed 
attack rate for the time period, post-treatment discontinuation, where data were not observed. 
An imputed rate for the entire 24-week period will be a weighted average of the observed rate 
up to the last day of diary collection (including days post treatment discontinuation) and the 
imputed rate for the time after treatment discontinuation during which data were not observed, 
with weighting based on the fraction of days with observed vs. unobserved data. 
For this rate, actual diary data collected after discontinuation of study treatment will be 
included in the observed rate where it is available by extending the time period in the 
denominator of the attack rate calculation to the last day that diary data were collected, even if 
past study treatment discontinuation. The only exception to this is if the subject started other 
prophylactic treatment after discontinuation of study treatment. In that case, actual diary data 
will be used up until the time of start of other prophylactic treatment.
For subjects for whom no diary data is missing post study treatment discontinuation, no 
imputation is necessary. An observed confirmed attack rate will be computed to include data 
post study treatment discontinuation as applicable, as long as the subject did not start other 
prophylactic therapy.
For subjects with missing data post study treatment discontinuation, missing data will be 
imputed as follows:
As shown above, if a subject discontinues study treatment or withdraws from the study, the 
imputation of rimputed will differ depending on whether the data are considered missing at 
random or not missing at random based on the reason for study treatment discontinuation or 
study withdrawal as shown in the table below. Data missing at random will be imputed using 
multiple imputation with 10 separate rounds of imputations, randomly selecting from observed 
confirmed attack rates of other subjects in the treatment group who completed the treatment 
for Part 1. Data not missing at random will be imputed using the median attack rate of subjects 
in the worst quartile of performance (ie, highest attack rate quartile) with regard to the 
primary endpoint for the given treatment group or the subject’s observed rate over the time 
period of available data, if worse.
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 79/168
3. A tipping point analysis was to be conducted using the observed data post treatment 
discontinuation combined with imputed data for missing time periods. However, for tipping 
point analysis, rimputed will be multiplied by a factor, δ, for the active treatment group in the 
determination of the analysed rate, as shown below. For the placebo group, there will be no 
such multiplicative factor. 
The tipping point is the value of δ that leads to a reversal of a significant p-value. It shows how 
much larger than expected the attack rate would need to be for the time period of missing data 
for the active group in order to “tip” the significance level to non-significant. For tipping point 
analysis, the analysed rate for the active treatment group is:
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑦𝑧𝑒𝑑  =  𝑓 ∗ 𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑  +  (1 ‒ 𝑓) ∗  𝛿 ∗ 𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑑
For the placebo group, the analysed rate would remain as:
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑦𝑧𝑒𝑑  =  𝑓 ∗ 𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑  +  (1 ‒ 𝑓) ∗ 𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑑
Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
Angioedema Quality of Life (Total and Domain Scores)
Change from baseline in AE-QoL questionnaire at Week 24 (total score) was a secondary endpoint for 
Part 1. For Part 1, changes from baseline in AE-QoL were to be assessed with a MMRM model with 
fixed effects for treatment, baseline attack rate, baseline AE-QoL, visit, and a visit by treatment 
interaction and a random effect for subject. An unstructured covariance structure was to be used. The 
estimated treatment difference comparing each active treatment to placebo at each post-baseline visit 
(Weeks 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24) was to be displayed together with the 95% CI and the associated p-
value. Least squares means (LSM) for each visit were also to be presented with the standard error and 
the number of subjects contributing to the LSM.
A summary and analysis of the number and percent of subjects with at least a 6-point decrease 
(Minimum Clinically Important Difference [MCID]) in total AE-QoL score will be performed by visit for 
Part 1. The analysis for Part 1 will be based on a logistic model with response of achievement of the 
MCID (yes/no), baseline attack rate and baseline AE-QoL total score as covariates and a fixed effect for 
treatment.
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 80/168
Number and Proportion of Days with Angioedema Symptoms
The number of proportion of days with angioedema symptoms through 24 weeks was a secondary 
endpoint for Part 1. For Part 1, the proportion of days with angioedema symptoms through Week 24 
was to be analysed using an ANCOVA model with baseline attack rate as a covariate and treatment 
included as a fixed effect. The estimated treatment difference comparing each active treatment to 
placebo was to be displayed together with the 95% CI and the associated p-value. LSMs were to be 
presented with the standard error and the number of subjects contributing to the LSM. A similar 
analysis was to be conducted based on the effective dosing period, beginning on Day 8 and continuing 
through Week 24.
Rate of Investigator/Expert-Confirmed HAE Attacks during Dosing in the Effective Treatment Period
The rate of investigator/expert-confirmed HAE attacks during dosing in the effective treatment period 
is a secondary endpoint for Part 1. 
Summaries and analysis of the investigator-confirmed attack rate using the ITT population for the 
effective treatment period (Day 8 through Week 24, inclusive) will be conducted using Poisson 
regression, similar to what is done for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis.
Subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint of investigator-confirmed attack rate during the entire 24-
week dosing period and the secondary endpoint of Week 24 change from baseline AEQoL (total score) 
were to be provided by:
1. Region (North America vs. Europe)
2. Sex
3. Race (white vs. other)
4. Baseline attack rate (≥ 2 attacks/month vs. < 2 attacks/month)
5. Age group (< 18, 18 to 65, > 65 years)
Forest plots showing the original results and the results by subgroups were to be provided.
A summary of TEAEs by age group was also to be provided.
Type I error control
There are 4 endpoints being tested. For each endpoint, there are 2 potential doses to be tested against 
placebo. The 4 endpoints were to be tested in a hierarchical fashion, with the 2 doses being tested 
using the Hochberg step-up procedure at each level of the hierarchy.
The testing hierarchy for study 302 was as follows:
1. The rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during dosing in the entire 24-week treatment 
period (Day 1 to Day 168)
2. Change from baseline in AE-QoL at Week 24 (total score)
3. Number and proportion of days with angioedema symptoms through 24 weeks
4. Rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during dosing in the effective treatment period 
(beginning on Day 8 through 24 weeks)
Multicentre Study
There were no adjustments made based on multiple centres.
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 81/168
Interim analyses
The protocol and SAP allowed for a blinded interim analysis to have been performed to estimate the 
standard deviation (SD) from the pooled treatment groups after 50% of the subjects had completed 24 
weeks. The sample size may have been re-estimated based on the variability from the pooled data. 
The final sample size was to have been the maximum of either the original planned sample size (32 
per group) or the re-estimated sample size. No statistical adjustment for the final analysis was 
planned. 
Due to rapid enrolment that exceeded the planned total sample size before the planned timing of 
sample size re-estimation was reached, i.e. when 50% of subjects reached Week 24, the planned 
sample size re-estimation was not conducted.
Results
Participant flow
A total of 160 patients were screened, of whom 121 were randomized. Of the 39 screen failures 36 did 
not meet all of the inclusion criteria or met an exclusion criterion. Three withdrew consent. One subject 
was randomized to placebo but did not receive study drug and was not included in the safety 
population.

Baseline data
A majority of patients were recruited at North American sites, 71.9% overall, with 28.1% from 
European sites. Almost all study patients were White (93.4%) in total. Ninety-five percent of study 
participants (n =115/121) were adults of whom 9 (7.4%) were aged over 65 years. Only 6 adolescent 
patients were enrolled in the study, 2 in each treatment group. Adolescent participants could only enrol 
at North American study sites. There were no participants aged over 75. 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 82/168
A majority of study participants were female ranging from 73.2% in the Berotralstat 110mg group to 
57.5% in the Berotralstat 150mg group (See Table 12).
All 121 subjects randomized met the required diagnostic criteria prior to study entry. The majority of 
subjects (88%) had C4 values < LLN with C1-INH functional levels < 50%. C1-INH functional levels 
(C1-INH-f) were measured at screening and C1-INH antigen (C1-INH-Ag) levels at baseline. Two 
subjects had levels C1-INH-f levels > 50% at screening but less than the LLN (74%). Both subjects 
had C1-INH-Ag levels that were < 10% at baseline.
The mean subject age at the first onset of HAE symptoms was 10.7 years (range 0.5 to 55 years). 
Fifty-two percent of subjects experienced their first HAE symptoms before the age of 12 years, and 
33% of subjects had their first HAE symptoms during adolescence (defined as ages of 12 to 17 years). 
Subjects had HAE symptoms for a mean of almost 10 years before receiving a diagnosis of HAE. 
Overall, the mean age at the time of diagnosis of HAE was approximately 20 years (range 0.5 to 67 
years). In a few subjects, the diagnosis was made prior to the onset of symptoms when subjects were 
screened due to family member diagnosis. Eighty-four percent of subjects had a family history of HAE 
with 89% of these having a parent with a confirmed diagnosis of HAE.
The 3 most common anatomic regions reported where swelling occurred during HAE attacks over the 
year prior to screening were stomach and abdomen (97%), hands and arms (93%), and feet and legs 
(88%). Most subjects reported having had a laryngeal attack (74%) in the past, and the mean (SD) 
number of lifetime laryngeal attacks they reported was 9.8 (± 15.6) attacks. Thirty percent of subjects 
reported having had a laryngeal attack in the year prior to screening. This varied from 24.4% for 
Berotralstat 110mg, 22.5% for Berotralstat 150mg and 42.5% for placebo.

Numbers analysed
The intent to treat (ITT) population included all randomized subjects, regardless of whether study 
treatment was administered (see Table 28). This population was the primary population for the 
analysis of the efficacy and health outcomes data. Data were analysed according to randomized 
treatment.

Outcomes and estimation
Descriptive statistics
There were 492, 402, and 601 subject-reported attacks in the berotralstat 110 mg, berotralstat 150 
mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Almost all subjects reported an attack (40/41 in the 
Berotralstat 110mg arm, 37/40 in the Berotralstat 150mg treatment arm and 39/41 in the placebo 
arm). Of the subject-reported attacks, approximately 90% were also investigator-confirmed attacks: 
443, 357, and 508 investigator-confirmed attacks in the berotralstat 110 mg, berotralstat 150 mg, and 
placebo treatment groups, respectively. The percentage of investigator confirmed attacks that were 
treated were slightly lower for those treated with Berotralstat 150 mg (80%) compared to Berotralstat 
110mg (86.9%) and placebo (88.4%). Descriptive statistics are shown in the following Table for 
subject reported and investigator confirmed attack rates.

Concomitant SOC-Rx used to treat HAE attacks during Part 1 are summarized in Table 30. A similar 
proportion of attacks were treated with SOC-Rx for all the treatment groups, in the ITT population 
(around 87%) treating 87% of all investigator-confirmed attacks with any SOC-Rx. Both Berotralstat 
groups used ‘Any C1-INH’ more frequently to treat an HAE attack than the placebo group (48.5% 
Berotralstat 110mg, Berotralstat 150mg 54.9% and placebo 36.4% of attacks). The most commonly 
used SOC-Rx were Firazyr (icatibant) and Berinert (C1-INH) in the berotralstat 110 mg ‘(41% and 
29% of attacks, respectively) and placebo (59% and 18% of attacks, respectively) treatment groups. 
The subjects in the berotralstat 150 mg treatment group used Berinert (42% of attacks) most 
commonly and more frequently and used Firazyr (38% of attacks) less frequently compared with the 
other 2 treatment groups.

a Medications were as recorded in the e-diary for each attack. The percentages provided were based on the number
of investigator-confirmed attacks.
b Medications displayed were those HAE medications recorded on the e-diary that were taken concomitantly with
study drug for an investigator-confirmed attack in Part 1. If a medication was used more than once for a given 
investigator-confirmed attack, a single occurrence was summarized.
The summary of any C1-INH includes plasma-derived C1-INH replacement (brand names = Cinryze, Berinert,
Haegarda), recombinant C1-INH replacement (brand name = Ruconest), and fresh frozen plasma. Subjects may 
have more than 1 medication that they use for HAE.

Primary endpoint
The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during dosing in the 
entire 24-week treatment period (Day 1 to first dose in Part 2). Investigator-confirmed attack rates for 
the ITT population are summarized in Table 31. The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed after the 
last subject completed Part 1 (had taken the first dose in Part 2). The negative binomial analysis 
estimated attack rates per 28 days were 1.65 for berotralstat 110 mg subjects, 1.31 for berotralstat 
150 mg subjects, and 2.35 for placebo subjects over the 24-week Part 1 dosing period. The study met 
its primary endpoint for both dose levels, with the 110 and 150 mg berotralstat doses reducing the 
HAE attack rate by 30% (p = 0.024) and 44% (p < 0.001), respectively, compared with placebo.

 a Investigator-confirmed attack rate was defined as (total number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks experienced in the period 
between first date/time of study drug in Part 1 and the first dose date/time in Part 2 [or the last dose date/time of dose in Part 1 + 
24 hours for subjects who discontinued drug in Part 1]) × 28/(date of first dose in Part 2 [or date of last dose in Part 1] - date of 
first dose in Part 1 + 1).
b Statistical analysis was based on a negative binomial regression model. The number of investigator-confirmed attacks was 
included as the dependent variable, the treatment was included as a fixed effect, baseline investigator-confirmed attack rate was 
included as a covariate, and the logarithm of duration on treatment was included as an offset variable.
The investigator-confirmed attack rate by month is shown in Figure 10 and table 32. After an initial 
decrease upon starting study drug, attack rates remained consistently lower for study drug vs. placebo 
across the 24-week dosing period.

Sensitivity analyses
Two sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint using the PP and completer populations were 
performed as well as analysis using subject reported attacks. In addition, three sensitivity analyses 
were performed in the ITT population as follows:
1. A missing data sensitivity analysis was conducted in which observed data post study drug 
discontinuation were included in attack rate determination.
2. A missing data sensitivity analysis was conducted in which observed data post study drug 
discontinuation were used in combination with imputed data for subjects who discontinued 
study treatment prior to the end of Part 1 and did not continue to record HAE attacks.
3. A tipping point analysis was conducted in which observed data post study drug discontinuation 
were combined with imputed data for subjects who discontinued study treatment prior to the 
end of Part 1 and did not continue to record HAE attacks.
All 6 sensitivity analyses of treatment with both doses of berotralstat were supportive of the primary 
analysis outcomes (results for 150 mg presented in Figure 11; ad-hoc figure).
Sensitivity Analysis Including Observed Data Post-treatment Discontinuation
This sensitivity analysis was supportive of the primary endpoint for both dose levels, with the 110 and 
150 mg doses reducing HAE attacks by 31% (95% CI: 5.7, 49.0; p = 0.020) and 42% (95% CI: 20.3, 
57.8; p < 0.001), respectively, vs. placebo. The negative binomial analysis estimated attack rates per 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 89/168
28 days were 1.60 for berotralstat 110 mg, 1.34 for berotralstat 150 mg, and 2.31 for placebo over 
the 24-week Part 1 dosing period.
Sensitivity Analysis Including Observed Data Post-treatment Discontinuation and Imputing 
Missing Data Post-treatment Discontinuation
This sensitivity analysis was supportive of the primary endpoint for both dose levels, with the 110 and 
150 mg doses reducing HAE attacks by 31% (95% CI: 4.9, 50.0; p = 0.023) and 35% (95% CI: 9.2, 
52.9; p = 0.011), respectively, vs. placebo. The negative binomial analysis estimated attack rates per 
28 days were 1.64 for berotralstat 110 mg subjects, 1.55 for berotralstat 150 mg subjects, and 2.37 
for placebo subjects over the 24-week Part 1 dosing period.
Missing Data Sensitivity Analysis: Tipping Point Analysis on the Rate of Investigator-
confirmed Attacks
In this analysis observed data post-treatment discontinuation were combined with imputed data for 
subjects who discontinued study treatment prior to the end of Part 1 and did not continue to provide 
attack information. However, for this analysis the imputed attack rates were multiplied by a factor, δ, 
for subjects on active treatment. No such factor was used for imputation of missing data for subjects 
on placebo treatment. The tipping point was estimated as the value of δ that tips the analysis to non-
significant. It shows how much greater than expected the attack rate on active treatment would need 
to be for the missing data to alter the result of the analysis. The 110 and 150 mg doses require a δ of 
3 and 2, respectively, to alter the results of the primary analysis.

Notes: The investigator-confirmed attack rate was defined as the total number of investigator-confirmed HAE

number of days during that period. The subject-reported attack rate was defined similarly for subject-reported HAE 
attacks. 
Secondary endpoints
Change from Baseline in Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire Total Score at Week 24
The AE-QoL scores range from 0 to 100, and a decrease (change with a negative value) in AE-QoL 
questionnaire scores indicates an improvement in the subject’s QoL. The MCID for the AE-QoL 
questionnaire is -6 (total score). All treatment groups had an average QoL improvement that exceed 
the MCID. The LSM differences from placebo in AE-QoL total scores were -2.8 (95% CI: -10.1, 4.5; p = 
0.453) and -4.9 (95% CI: -12.2, 2.4; p = 0.188) for the berotralstat 110 and 150 mg treatment 
groups, respectively. The differences from placebo were not statistically significant. A hierarchical 
approach was used for statistical testing. As the secondary endpoint for change from baseline in 
Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire Total Score at week 24 was not met p values for the 
remaining secondary endpoints are nominal and no inference can be drawn.

Number and Proportion of Days with Angioedema Symptoms Through 24 Weeks
As the first secondary endpoint did not meet statistical significance, the p values for subsequent 
efficacy endpoints can only be reported as nominal. The mean (SD) number of days subjects had 
angioedema symptoms from investigator-confirmed attacks was 20.8 (± 19.22), 19.4 (± 21.50), and 
29.2 (± 24.29) days in the 24-week treatment period for the berotralstat 110 mg, berotralstat 150 
mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. The LSM (SE) proportion of days subjects had 
angioedema symptoms from investigator-confirmed attacks were 0.134 (0.0191), 0.119 (0.0194), and 
0.197 (0.0196) days over the 24-week treatment period for the berotralstat 110 mg, berotralstat 150 
mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. The differences from the placebo treatment in the 
LSM proportion of the 169 days of treatment with angioedema symptoms were -0.062 (95% CI: -
0.117, -0.008; nominal p = 0.025; approximately 10 more symptom-free days over the 6 months of 
Part 1) and -0.078 (95% CI: -0.133, -0.023; nominal p = 0.006; approximately 13 more symptom-
free days over the 6 months of Part 1) for the berotralstat 110 mg and 150 mg groups, respectively. 
Rate of Investigator-confirmed HAE Attacks During Dosing in the Effective Treatment Period
The rate of investigator confirmed attacks for the effective treatment period gives an analysis of the 
efficacy of active treatment after berotralstat had reached steady-state concentrations in subjects 
given the effective half-life of 150 mg berotralstat in Study BCX7353-106 of 89 hours. The reductions 
in attack rate relative to the placebo treatment group were 30% (95% CI: 4.3, 49.3; nominal p = 
0.026) and 47% (95% CI: 25.6, 61.5; nominal p < 0.001) for the berotralstat 110 and 150 mg 
treatment groups, respectively (Table 34). Similar results were observed for the PP population. The 
treatment effects observed with berotralstat in this analysis were similar to those determined for the 
entire dosing period.

a Investigator-confirmed attack rate during the effective treatment period was defined as (total number of
investigator-confirmed HAE attacks experienced in the period between Study Day 8 in Part 1 and the first dose
date/time in Part 2 [or the last dose date/time in Part 1 + 24 hours for subjects who discontinued drug in
Part 1]) × 28/(date of first dose in Part 2 [or last dose date in Part 1] – date of Study Day 8 in Part 1 + 1).
b Statistical analysis was based on a negative binomial regression model. The number of investigator-confirmed
attacks was included as the dependent variable, the treatment was included as a fixed effect, baseline investigator 
confirmed attack rate was included as a covariate, and the logarithm of duration on treatment was included as an
offset variable. 
Ancillary analyses
Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were performed for region, sex, race, 
baseline attack rate, and age group. Ad-hoc exploratory subgroup analyses included prior androgen 
use, baseline weight, and baseline BMI. The study was not designed or powered to make definitive 
statements about efficacy by subgroup. Results of the sub-group analyses are presented with a Forest 
plot (Figure 12)

Table 37, containing an analysis of baseline and on-study investigator-confirmed attack rates by 
subgroup, shows that male subjects in the placebo group had a minor change from a baseline 
investigator-confirmed mean (SD) attack rate of 2.86 attacks per month (± 0.93) to 2.70 attacks per 
month (± 1.03) during placebo treatment in Part 1. Female subjects in the placebo group had a larger 
change from baseline of 2.93 attacks per month (± 1.22) to 2.35 attacks per month (± 1.83) during 
placebo treatment. An ad-hoc multiple regression analysis looking at the relationship of sex, among 
other potential covariates, to the on-study attack rate found that sex was not a significant predictor of 
the on-study attack rate. This same regression analysis identified that the baseline attack rate was a 
significant predictor of the on-study attack rate, and females in the berotralstat 150 mg treatment 
group had a higher mean (SD) baseline attack rate of 3.4 (± 1.6) attacks per month relative to the 
total group (3.0 [± 1.4] attacks per month) while the baseline attack rate for males in the berotralstat 
150 mg treatment group (2.7 [± 1.4] attacks per month) was lower.

efficacy and safety of two dose levels of BCX7353 as an oral treatment for the prevention of attacks 
in subjects with hereditary angioedema
Study identifier
BCX7353-302
Design
BCX7353-302 was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of berotralstat 
administered at doses of 110 mg or 150 mg QD to reduce the frequency of 
attacks in subjects with Type 1 or 2 HAE over 24 weeks (Part 1). Following 
week 24, subjects continued study drug: placebo subjects were re-
randomized to active treatment (110 mg or 150 mg berotralstat); subjects 
initially randomized to active drug continued on their assigned dose through 
48 weeks.
Duration of main phase:
24 weeks
Duration of Run-in phase:
14 to 56 days
Duration of Extension phase:
24 weeks (total 48 weeks)
Hypothesis
The primary study hypothesis was that the treatment effect in reduction of 
HAE attacks during 24 weeks of prophylactic berotralstat will be superior to 
placebo.

Notes
Secondary endpoints were analysed using hierarchical testing. Although the 
primary efficacy endpoint of the study was met, results for the first 
secondary endpoint, AE-QoL, were not statistically significant vs. placebo for 
either treatment group; therefore, formal statistical testing for significance 
was not performed on the descending secondary efficacy endpoints. Days 
without angioedema symptoms and the attack rate during the effective 
treatment period were both reduced in the berotralstat 150 mg group 
compared with the placebo group and are reported using nominal p-values
Analysis description Primary and Secondary
For the investigator-confirmed attack rate endpoints, entire dosing period in 
Part 1 and effective treatment period in Part 1, the rate reduction from 
placebo was estimated from a negative binomial regression model where the 
number of investigator-confirmed attacks was included as the dependent 
variable, the treatment was included as a fixed effect, baseline investigator-
confirmed attack rate was included as a covariate and the logarithm of 
duration on treatment was included as an offset variable. For the change 
from baseline in AE-QoL total score at Week 24, the difference was the LSM 
difference from a mixed-model repeated measures analysis with 
investigator-confirmed baseline attack rate, baseline AE-QoL, treatment 
group, visit and visit × treatment group interaction included as fixed effects, 
and subject included as a random effect. For the proportion of days with 
angioedema symptoms, the difference was the LSM difference from an 
ANCOVA model with baseline investigator-confirmed attack rate as a 
covariate and treatment included as a fixed effect. The 95% CI was the 95% 
CI for the rate reduction or difference as generated from the models noted

BCX7353-301 A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Two Dose Levels of BCX7353 as an Oral 
Treatment for the Suppression of Events in Subjects with Hereditary Angioedema
Study BCX7353-301 is a small randomised double blind placebo controlled trial conducted in Japanese 
patients with a similar design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment arms, and primary endpoint 
to Study BCX7353-302. Study BCX7353-204 is an ongoing uncontrolled phase 2, open label study to 
evaluate long-term safety, in which effectiveness is evaluated as a secondary endpoint.
The study was conducted at 10 sites in Japan and has a similar design to Study BCX7353-302 but with 
a smaller population enrolled. The applicant has presented results for Part 1 of the Study which 
concluded at 24 weeks. Part 2 of the study is ongoing. 
Study participants
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to those for Study BCX7353-302. 
Treatments
The treatment arms were the same as those for Study BCX7353-302.

Objectives
The primary objective of Part 1 the study was to determine the efficacy of berotralstat 110 and 150 mg 
QD administered for 24 weeks compared to placebo in the suppression of angioedema events in 
subjects with HAE. 
The efficacy related secondary objectives were to: assess the effects of berotralstat on HAE disease 
activity and angioedema event characteristics; and evaluate the effects of berotralstat on QoL. 
Outcomes/endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was: the rate of expert-confirmed angioedema events 
during dosing in the entire 24-week treatment period (Days 1 to 168). Secondary efficacy endpoints 
were as follows: number and proportion of days with angioedema symptoms through 24 weeks; rate of 
expert-confirmed angioedema events during dosing in the effective treatment period (beginning on 
Day 8 through to the first dose of study drug in Part 2; change from baseline (CFB) in Angioedema 
Quality of Life questionnaire (AE-QoL) at Week 24 (total score).
Randomisation and blinding
Subjects were randomized via the interactive (web or voice) response system (IXRS) in a 1:1:1 
(active: active: placebo) ratio, with enrolment stratified by the baseline angioedema event rate over 
the period from screening to randomization (≥ 2 events per month vs. < 2 events per month (similar 
to Study 302).
This was a double-blind study throughout Part 1. As such, study drug assignment was blinded to the 
investigator, study staff, study subjects, and clinical research organization staff. Sponsor employees 
were also blinded to the treatment allocation of individual subjects, with the exception of sponsor staff 
responsible for managing clinical supplies. Employees who were not blinded to drug assignment had no 
access to any other subject-level information for the duration of the study.
Statistical methods
Statistical Analysis Plan
The study 301 SAP was almost identical to that for study 302. The SAP also detailed pre-specified 
pooled analyses of the part 1 301 and 302 study data. The pooled analyses used identical methods as 
for study 301, unless otherwise stated.
SAP v1.0 is dated 04 November 2019 and is based on Protocol Version 5.0 dated 29 August 2019. The 
database was locked to conduct the Part 1 analysis on 6 December 2019.
The applicant highlighted a number of changes in the planned analyses in the Part 1 Interim CSR. 
Changes from protocol-specified analyses included the following:




The definition of the screen failure population has changed from subjects not dispensed 
treatment to those who are not randomized and are reported as screen failures in the eCRF.
The definition of the PP population has been altered to include ≥ 85% treatment compliance as 
an inclusion requirement.
Part 1 is defined as Day 1 to first dose of Part 2 rather than Day 1 through Day 168.
The entire dosing period for Part 1 is defined as Day 1 to first dose of Part 2 rather than Day 1 
through Day 168 and Day 1 through Day 168 + 24 hours.
A number of post-hoc analyses were also performed.

Analysis Populations
As for study 302.
Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint
As for study 302, except a negative binomial regression model rather than a Poisson regression model 
was to be used for the primary analysis. 
Expert confirmed angioedema events from Study 301 and investigator-confirmed HAE attacks from 
Study 302 were considered equivalent for the pooled analysis and were collectively referred to as 
“confirmed HAE events” in this CSR.
Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
As for study 302.
Type I error control
As for study 302 4 endpoints were included in the confirmatory testing strategy. For each endpoint, 2 
potential doses were to be tested against placebo. The 4 endpoints were to be tested in a hierarchical 
fashion, with the 2 doses being tested using the Hochberg step-up procedure at each level of the 
hierarchy.
The testing hierarchy for study 301 was as follows:
1. The rate of expert-confirmed HAE events during dosing in the entire 24-week treatment
period (Day 1 to Day 168)
2. Number and proportion of days with angioedema symptoms through 24 weeks
3. Rate of expert-confirmed HAE events during dosing in the effective dosing period
(beginning on Day 8 through 24 weeks)
4. Change from baseline in AE-QoL at Week 24 (total score)
Multicentre Studies
There were no adjustments made based on multiple centres.
Interim analyses
No interim analyses for efficacy were planned during part 1 of the study.
Subgroup analyses – 301
No subgroup analyses were planned due to the small sample size.

Results
Participant flow
Overall, a total of 25 subjects were screened, 19 subjects were randomized (ITT population), and all 
19 subjects (100%) were treated (safety population): 6, 7, and 6 subjects in the berotralstat 110 mg, 
berotralstat 150 mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Of the 6 screen failures who were 
not enrolled in the study, 5 subjects did not meet ≥ 1 IC and/or met ≥ 1 EC and 1 subject withdrew 
consent
A total of 18 subjects (95%) completed study drug dosing in Part 1: 6 berotralstat 110 mg subjects 
(100%), 7 berotralstat 150 mg subjects (100%), and 5 placebo subjects (83%). No subjects in the 
110 and 150 mg berotralstat treatment groups discontinued study drug.
Figure 13: BCX7353-301 Part 1: Disposition of Subjects
Six patients had a major protocol deviation (Berotralstat 110 mg n = 1, berotralstat 150mg n = 3 and 
placebo n = 2)). It was determined that none of the major protocol deviations resulted in inappropriate 
subject selection or affected the overall quality or interpretation of the study data.
Baseline data
Overall, 84% of subjects were female (Table 39). The majority (95%) of subjects were adults aged 18 
to 64 years and one was aged between 65 and 74 years. The mean age was 42.1 years (range 21 to 
69 years). Most subjects were Asian (95%), with 1 subject with race unknown but of Hispanic or Latino 
ethnicity (5.3%) enrolled (in the 150 mg dose group).

Numbers analysed 
The ITT population included all randomized subjects, regardless of whether study treatment was 
administered. This population was the primary population for the analysis of the efficacy and health 
outcomes data. Data were analysed according to randomized treatment. The ITT population was the 
same as the randomised population.
Outcomes and estimation
All subjects reported at least 1 attack and all had at least 1 investigator confirmed attack. The number 
of investigator confirmed attacks was highest in the placebo arm (n = 94) followed by the berotralstat 
110mg treatment arm (n = 71) and the berotralstat 150mg treatment arm (n = 46) respectively 
(Table 40).

The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of expert-confirmed angioedema events during dosing in 
the entire 24-week treatment period (Day 1 to first dose in Part 2). The primary efficacy endpoint was 
assessed after the last subject completed Part 1. Expert-confirmed angioedema event rates for the ITT 
population are summarized in Table 41. The study met its primary endpoint for the 150 mg dose level, 
and there was a clear dose response, with the 110 and 150 mg berotralstat doses reducing the rate of 
angioedema events by 25% (p = 0.181) and 49% (p = 0.003), respectively, compared with placebo. 
The negative binomial analysis estimated event rates per 28 days were 1.64 for berotralstat 110 mg 
subjects, 1.11 for berotralstat 150 mg subjects, and 2.18 for placebo subjects over the 24-week Part 1 
dosing period.

Table 36: BCX7353-301 Part 1: Summary of Expert-confirmed Angioedema Event Rates 
(Entire Dosing Period) (ITT Population)
Expert-confirmed angioedema event rate was defined as (total number of expert-confirmed angioedema events experienced in the 
period between first date/time of study drug in Part 1 and the first dose date/time in Part 2 [or the last dose date/time of dose in 
Part 1 + 24 hours for subjects who discontinued drug in Part 1]) × 28/(date of first dose in Part 2 [or date of last dose in Part 1] - 
date of first dose in Part 1 + 1). b Statistical analysis was based on a negative binomial regression model. The number of expert-
confirmed angioedema events was included as the dependent variable, the treatment was included as a fixed effect, baseline expert-
confirmed event rate was included as a covariate, and the logarithm of duration on treatment was included as an offset variable.
One subject discontinued study drug prior to the end of Part 1 but remained on study and continued to 
provide event data post-treatment discontinuation. This sensitivity analysis was supportive of the 
primary endpoint for both dose levels, with the 110 and 150 mg doses reducing angioedema events by 
25% (95% CI: -12.9, 49.6; p = 0.171) and 49% (95% CI: 21.1, 67.2; p = 0.003), respectively, vs. 
placebo. The negative binomial analysis estimated event rates per 28 days were 1.64 for berotralstat 
110 mg subjects, 1.11 for berotralstat 150 mg subjects, and 2.18 for placebo subjects over the 24-
week Part 1 dosing period.

Secondary endpoints were analysed using hierarchical testing as shown in Table 42. The primary 
efficacy endpoint of the study was met for the 150 mg dose level, allowing testing of the first 
secondary endpoint of proportion of days with angioedema symptoms during Part 1 at the 150 mg 
dose level only; the results for the first secondary endpoint were not statistically significant vs. placebo 
for the berotralstat 150 mg treatment group; therefore, formal statistical testing for significance was 
not performed on the descending secondary efficacy endpoints. The angioedema event rate during the 
effective treatment period and the AE-QoL total score at Week 24 were both improved in both

For the expert-confirmed angioedema event rate endpoints, entire dosing period in Part 1 and effective treatment period in Part 1, the rate reduction 
from placebo was estimated from a negative binomial regression model where the number of expert-confirmed angioedema events was included as the 
dependent variable, the treatment was included as a fixed effect, baseline expert-confirmed event rate was included as a covariate and the logarithm of 
duration on treatment was included as an offset variable. For the CFB in AE-QoL total score at Week 24, the difference was the LSM difference from a 
mixed-model repeated measures analysis with expert-confirmed baseline event rate, baseline AE-QoL, treatment group, visit and visit × treatment group 
interaction included as fixed effects, and subject included as a random effect. For the proportion of days with angioedema symptoms, the difference was 
the LSM difference from an ANCOVA model with baseline expert-confirmed event rate as a covariate and treatment included as a fixed effect.
The 95% CI was for the rate reduction or difference as generated from the models noted in footnote a.
A comparison was considered statistically significant if the unadjusted p-value was less than the corresponding Hochberg adjusted α level.
Ancillary analysis
No subgroup analyses were conducted.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)
The applicant pooled results from Study 302 and 301.This pooling would appear to have been done to 
fulfil requirements for the Japanese regulatory authority. 
A prespecified statistical analysis was conducted using combined data from Study 301 and BCX7353-
302 (Study 302), the pivotal Phase 3 efficacy and safety study, in the evaluation of efficacy. Expert-
confirmed HAE events from Study 301 and investigator-confirmed HAE attacks from Study 302 were 
considered equivalent for the combined analysis and are collectively referred to as “confirmed HAE 
events”.
The study design was similar for both studies with some slight difference in the secondary endpoints. 
Differences between recruited populations have been discussed in the assessment of Study 301.
Combined subject disposition
Overall, a total of 185 subjects were screened, 140 subjects were randomized (ITT population), and 
139 of these subjects (99%) were treated (safety population). A total of 126 subjects (90%) 
completed study drug dosing in Part 1: 43 berotralstat 110 mg subjects (92%), 44 berotralstat 150 mg 
subjects (94%), and 39 placebo subjects (85%). Among the subjects in the 110 and 150 mg 
berotralstat treatment groups, 3 (6.4%) and 1 (2.1%) subjects, respectively, discontinued study drug 
due to a laboratory abnormality or AE, 1 (2.1%) and 1 (2.1%) subjects, respectively, discontinued 
study drug due to perceived lack of efficacy, and 0 and 1 (2.1%) subject, respectively, withdrew 
consent. Among the placebo-treated subjects, 1 subject (2.2%) discontinued study drug due to a 
laboratory abnormality or AE, 2 subjects (4.3%) discontinued study drug due to perceived lack of 
efficacy, 1 subject (2.2%) withdrew consent, and 1 subject (2.2%) discontinued for other (subject’s 
choice) reasons. One subject in the placebo treatment group discontinued at the end of Part 1. A total 
of 125 of 126 subjects who completed study drug dosing in Part 1 continued into Part 2 of the studies.
Baseline characteristics 
The baseline event rate is shown in Table 29 and is similar for all treatment groups. The percentage 
with 2 or more baseline attacks/months was highest in those treated with berotralstat 150mg (72.3%) 
compared to berotralstat 110mg (63.8%) and placebo (65.2%). 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of confirmed HAE events during dosing in the entire 24-
week treatment period (Day 1 to first dose in Part 2). The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed after 
the last subject completed Part 1 (had taken the first dose in Part 2).
The combined analysis met the primary endpoint for both dose levels, with the 110 and 150 mg 
berotralstat doses reducing HAE events by 30% (p = 0.013) and 46% (p < 0.001), respectively, 
compared with placebo. The negative binomial analysis estimated event rates per 28 days were 1.65 
for berotralstat 110 mg subjects, 1.27 for berotralstat 150 mg subjects, and 2.34 for placebo subjects 
over the 24-week Part 1 dosing period.

Event Rates (Entire Dosing Period) (Combined ITT Population)
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted using similar methods to those for Study 302 and 
Study 301. All sensitivity analyses were supportive. However, the sensitivity analysis using observed 
data post-treatment discontinuation and imputing missing data post-treatment discontinuation showed 
a reduction in effect size. for Berotralstat 150mg. The 110 and 150 mg doses reduced HAE events by 
31% (95% CI: 7.6, 47.8; p = 0.012) and 39% (95% CI: 18.0, 54.4; p = 0.001), respectively, vs. 
placebo. The negative binomial analysis estimated event rates per 28 days were 1.64 for berotralstat 
110 mg subjects, 1.44 for berotralstat 150 mg subjects, and 2.36 for placebo subjects over the 24-
week Part 1 dosing period.
Confirmed HAE Events Over Time
The confirmed HAE event rate by month is shown in Figure 15 and table 44 for the combined ITT 
population. After an initial decrease upon starting study drug, event rates remained consistently lower 
for berotralstat vs. placebo across the 24-week dosing period.

Figure 15: Combined BCX7353-301 and BCX7353-302 Part 1: Plot of Mean Confirmed HAE 
Event Rates by Month (Combined ITT Population)
In the combined ITT population, the effects of berotralstat in reducing event rate were evident in 
Month 1 and stable over the 6-month duration of Part 1 (Table 44). The berotralstat 150 mg treatment 
group had a mean event rate of 2.9 events per month at baseline that decreased to 1.64 events per 
month by the end of Month 1 and held relatively steady through Month 6 with mean event rates of 
1.57, 1.48, 1.46, 1.3, and 1.6 events per month at the ends of Months 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively 
(Table 63). There was a slight increase at Month 6 similar to the pattern seen in Study 302 and is 
probably driven by the larger Study 302 population. It is unclear whether the increase in event rate at 
6 months is the start of a trend or due to random variation.

A similar range of subgroup analysis were conducted in the combined population as in Study 302. 
Results for the subgroup analysis by sex and baseline event rate are presented below. The results of all 
the subgroup analyses are shown in the Forest plot (Figure 16). As expected for the pooled analysis 
(with only 1 additional male patient in each treatment arm) and similar to Study 302 an apparently 
poorer response is noted for females compared to males. For both berotralstat doses. In addition, a 
larger rate reduction percentage from placebo for berotralstat 150mg is seen   in those with a lower 
baseline event rate compared to those with a higher baseline event rate.

Notes:
The confirmed HAE event rate was defined as the total number of confirmed HAE events experienced in the period 
of interest adjusted for the length of a month (defined as 28 days) and the number of days during that period.
* indicates a CI was too wide to display. Numbers given are the rate reduction (%) from placebo (95% CI).
Prior androgens were as noted on the HAE Medical and Medication History – Part 1 and Part 2 eCRFs. These 
medications included any of the following: androgens (unspecified), oxandrolone, methyl-testosterone, danazol 
(brand name = Danocrine), and stanozolol.
Secondary endpoints
Secondary endpoints were analysed using hierarchical testing as shown in Table 46. Statistical 
significance for the primary efficacy endpoint, first secondary endpoint (days with angioedema 
symptoms), and second secondary endpoint (event rate in effective dosing period) of the combined 
analysis were met; however, results for the final secondary endpoint, AE-QoL, were not statistically 
significant vs. placebo for either treatment group (Table 46).
The mean (SD) number of days subjects had angioedema symptoms from confirmed HAE events was 
23.9 (± 22.68), 19.0 (± 20.64), and 30.8 (± 24.64) days in the 24-week treatment period for the 
berotralstat 110 mg, berotralstat 150 mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. The LSM (SE) 
proportion of days subjects had angioedema symptoms from confirmed HAE events were 0.150 
(0.0185), 0.118 (0.0185), and 0.203 (0.0189) days over the 24-week treatment period for the 
berotralstat 110 mg, berotralstat 150 mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. The differences 
from the placebo treatment in the LSM proportion of the 169 days of treatment with angioedema 
symptoms were -0.053 (95% CI: -0.105, 0.000; p = 0.048; approximately 9 more symptom-free days 
over the 6 months of Part 1) and -0.085 (95% CI: -0.138, -0.033; p = 0.002; approximately 14 more 
symptom-free days over the 6 months of Part 1) for the berotralstat 110 and 150 mg groups, 
respectively.
The rate of confirmed HAE events for the effective treatment period gives an analysis of the efficacy of 
active treatment after berotralstat had reached steady-state concentrations in subjects given the 
effective half-life of 150 mg berotralstat in Study 106 of 89 hours. The reductions in event rate relative

Study BCX7353-204 is an ongoing uncontrolled phase 2, open label study to evaluate long-term 
safety, in which effectiveness is evaluated as a secondary endpoint. The study was conducted at 
multiple sites. The applicant has presented data from an interim analysis of a total of 227 study 
participants treated with either berotralstat 110mg (n =100) or berotralstat 150mg (n = 127). Apart 
from in South Korea patients were not allocated to the 110mg and 150mg doses by randomisation.
Study BCX7353-204 underwent a number of protocol changes and patients were recruited under 
different versions of the protocol. Initially only the 150mg dose, with the 110mg dose added under a 
later version of the protocol. In addition, the potential duration of the study is 96 weeks in the US and 
240 weeks outside of the US.
Inclusion criteria also changed over the course of the study. All participants had Type 1 or 2 HAE and 
were either recruited from previous berotralstat studies or were new patients that it was thought could 
benefit from berotralstat treatment. Of note no baseline attack rate was calculated primarily as this 
was a safety study and no minimum baseline attack rate was required for inclusion in the study. In 
addition: 1) not all subjects entering the study had baseline measures collected as some subjects were 
enrolling from a previous berotralstat study; 2) some subjects were on prophylactic HAE medications 
at study entry; and 3) some subjects had recently discontinued androgens used as HAE prophylaxis, 
precluding an adequate attack rate collection period.
The spectrum of prohibited medications was narrowed during the conduct of the study based on safety 
information and DDI study data. In the most recent protocols, only drugs which worsened the 
underlying disease, those with narrow therapeutic indices with lack of drug level monitoring, those with 
known QT prolongation, and those whose efficacy may be significantly diminished by CYP inhibition are 
prohibited However, for version 6 of the protocol subjects who had switched from another prophylaxis 
were required to discontinue androgens at least 28 days prior to starting treatment with berotralstat; 
discontinue tranexamic acid and C1-INH dosing 14 days after berotralstat initiation; and the final dose 
of lanadelumab could be given with the first dose of berotralstat.
The secondary efficacy endpoints of the study according to version 7 of the protocol were: 

Number and rate of HAE attacks (described in the study report as adjusted HAE attacks*)
 Durability of response (attack rate trend over time)

Number and proportion of days with angioedema symptoms

Severity of attacks
Attacks were identified from paper diaries completed by study participants. 
*Adjusted attacks must have included at least 1 symptom of swelling, have a response of 'no' to the diary question, 'In retrospect, could there 
be an alternative explanation for your symptoms other than an HAE attack (i.e. allergic reaction, viral cold etc.)?', and be unique (attack 
began > 24 hours from the end of the prior attack). Any attack that began within 24 hours from the end of a prior attack was combined with 
the prior attack. If the entire adjusted attack was untreated, it must have had a duration > 24 hours. (broadly similar to investigator 
confirmed attacks in Study 302 but with 48 hours rather than 24 hours).
Treatment administered participants were either treated with Berotralstat 110mg or berotralstat 
150mg PO daily. Specific regions and/or countries initiated the study under different versions of the 
protocol, and consequently treatment allocation was based on the version of the protocol the sites 
were initiated under. Initially, the study was a single-arm study and all subjects received treatment 
with berotralstat 150 mg. (Protocol Version 1). Protocol Versions 2.0 through 5.0, subjects were 
initially allocated to 1 of 2 treatment groups: 
Group 1: berotralstat 110 mg administered orally QD 
Group 2: berotralstat 150 mg administered orally QD
Subject disposition 
As of the data cut off of 20 August 2019, a total of 168 subjects (74.0%) are ongoing in the study. Of 
the 227 subjects allocated and treated with study drug, 103 subjects (45.4%) have completed the 
Week 48 visit on study drug and an additional 67 subjects (29.5%) are continuing on berotralstat but 
have not yet reached 48 weeks of dosing.
Overall 59 study participants prematurely discontinued study drug, 26 (26%) in the Berotralstat 
110mg treatment arm and 33 (26%) in the Berotralstat 150mg arm. The most common reason for 
discontinuation was perceived lack of efficacy.
A total of 28 subjects (12.3%), 17 of 100 subjects (17.0%) in the berotralstat 110-mg dose group and 
11 of 126 subjects (8.7%) in the berotralstat 150-mg dose group, discontinued the study drug due to 
perceived lack of efficacy Twenty of the 28 subjects who discontinued study drug due to a perceived 
lack of efficacy discontinued prior to Week 12.

Demographics and baseline characteristics
227 study participants with a diagnosis of Type 1 or 2 HAE are included in the study report, 100 in the 
Berotralstat 110mg group and 127 in Berotralstat 150mg group.
Fifteen (15%) of those treated with Berotralstat 110mg had participated in a previous Berotralstat 
study and 61 (48%) of the Berotralstat 150mg treatment arm had previously participated in a 
Berotralstat study.
Overall, 10 adolescent subjects (4.4%) aged 12 to 17 years of age and 5 elderly subjects (2.2%) ≥ 65 
years of age were enrolled in the study. The remainder were aged 18 to 64 years... Overall 61.2% of 
participants were female, with similar proportions in each treatment arm.
At screening, 81% of subjects reported that they had used prophylactic treatments for HAE in the past. 
Past prophylactic treatment included use of androgens (62.6% of subjects), tranexamic acid (33.9% of 
subjects), and any C1-INH (23.8% of subjects). A total of 26 subjects (11.5%) were taking 
medications for HAE prophylaxis at screening. By Day 169 (24 weeks) and Day 337 (Week 48), 13 
(50%) and 8 (31%) of these subjects, respectively, remained on concomitant HAE prophylactic 
medications. Twenty eight percent had experienced laryngeal attacks in the year preceding the study.
Number and rate of HAE attacks
Baseline attack rates were not calculated for this study for the following reasons: (1) not all 
subjects entering the study had baseline measures collected as some subjects were rolling over from 
previous studies; (2) some subjects were on other prophylactic HAE medications; and (3) some 
subjects were discontinuing androgens that were used as HAE prophylaxis.
For the 150-mg dose group, the mean (SD) attack rate through week 48 was 1.36 (1.51) attacks per 
month and the median attack rate was 0.93 attacks per month. For the 110mg dose the mean (SD) 
attack rate was 1.161 (1.320) and median attack rate was 0.796 (See following Table)

Monthly attack rate was defined as the total number of adjusted HAE attacks experienced during the treatment
period adjusted for the length of a month (defined as 28 days) and the number of days the subject was on 
treatment during that month.
Note: Paper diaries and corresponding attack data were returned at each study visit for the time period leading up 
to the visit and therefore lag a subject’s progress through the study by up to 12 weeks. The attack rate was 
determined based on reported attacks up to the time of data cut with no distinction between diaries remaining with 
subjects until their next visit and diaries with no attacks. Therefore, attack rates reported at later study timepoints 
may underestimate the number of attacks. Diary data for Months 1 to 6 are very complete: the 110-mg dose group
returned all diaries; the 150-mg dose group has 3 of 673 months of diary data remaining with the subjects. 
Estimates of the diary data remaining with subjects for Months 7 to 12 are approximately 6% of diaries for the 150-
mg dose group and approximately 20% of diaries for 110 mg dose group.

Number and proportion of days with angioedema symptoms
Total days with angioedema symptoms were generally similar between treatment groups and declined 
over time: during Month 1 the median days (median percentage of days) with symptoms was 2.0 
(7.1%) and 2.0 (7.1%) days for the 110- and 150-mg dose groups, respectively; by Month 6 the 
median days was 1.0 (3.6%) and 1.0 (3.6%) days respectively; and Month 12 the median days was 
0.0 (0.0%) and 0.0 (0.0%) days respectively. Note that the decline in number of days with 
angioedema symptoms over time might be related to study discontinuation.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
In support of the application the applicant submitted a phase 2 randomised double blind placebo- 
controlled dose finding and proof of concept study (BCX7353-203), a phase 3 randomised double blind 
placebo controlled trial conducted in North American and European populations (BCX7353-302), a 
smaller study with the same design conducted in a Japanese population (BCX7353-301) and an open 
label uncontrolled phase 2 study (BCX7353-204). The applicant has also provided a pre-specified 
pooled analysis of data from Studies BCX7353 302 and 301.
Design and conduct of clinical studies
Three of the four submitted studies were randomised double blind, placebo-controlled trials. The one 
uncontrolled study was primarily a safety and tolerability study with efficacy as a secondary endpoint. 
Studies BCX7353 302 and 301 can be regarded as pivotal studies. Study 301 is a smaller study 
conducted in a Japanese population and has a similar design to Study 302. Both studies are still 
ongoing. Efficacy was evaluated at the end of Part 1 in both studies i.e. after 24 weeks treatment.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The patient population in all submitted efficacy studies were required to have a diagnosis of either 
Type 1 or Type 2 HAE. Only adult patients were eligible for recruitment to the dose finding study.  
Adolescents were eligible to participate in both Study BCX7353-302 and 301 studies. However, only 6 
adolescent patients (2 per study arm) were recruited to Study BCX7353-302 and all 6 were at North 
American sites. Study BCX7353-203 subjects were required to have had a documented attack rate of 
at least 2 HAE attacks per month for 3 consecutive months within 6 months prior to screening. 
Whereas for Studies BCX7353-302 and 301 subjects were required to have had ≥ 2 HAE attacks during 
a 56-day run-in period. This suggests that the patients in the dose finding/proof of concept study may 
have been a more severely affected population than those in the pivotal studies. Any use of 
prophylaxis medication was prohibited within 7 days prior to screening or during the study in Study 
BCX7353 203 and for 14 days prior to screening and during the study for BCX7353 302 and 301. 
The inclusion criteria regarding the diagnosis of Type 1 or 2 HAE and characteristics of a HAE attack 
were defined in greater detail for the pivotal studies compared to the dose finding study. There was a 
clear definition of an attack with a requirement that the attacks included symptoms of swelling, have 
either been treated, required medical attention or been documented to cause functional impairment 
and be unique i.e. did not begin within 48 hours of a previous attack. 
Use of a C1-INH therapy for treatment of acute attacks was not excluded at any time, nor was C1-INH 
for pre-procedure prophylaxis for an unplanned/unforeseen procedure. In general, the list of prohibited 
medications was similar in the dose finding study and pivotal studies.
All of the randomised controlled studies were placebo controlled. This is considered acceptable. An 
additional treatment arm with an active comparator would have been preferable but it is acknowledged 
that this could have presented challenges in terms of blinding as the alternatives are not administered 
orally. However, given the rarity of the condition the lack of an active comparator may have presented 
recruitment challenges. 
Primary endpoint
The primary endpoint for the dose finding/proof of concept study was the investigator confirmed attack 
rate, i.e. the total number of (count) confirmed attacks during the treatment period and standardized 
to an appropriate denominator (e.g. 7 days for a weekly attack rate) reported in the full analysis set 
population (all subjects who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and had post-
baseline HAE diary data recorded. Subjects were analysed according to the randomized treatment). 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 119/168
The primary analysis of treatment-effect was performed using an ANCOVA with the adjusted qualifying 
attack rate as the covariate. Data on symptoms was recorded by the patient in a paper diary.
For both phase 3 studies the primary endpoint was the rate of confirmed HAE attacks during the entire 
24-week dosing period of Part 1 evaluated in the ITT population, defined as the total number of 
investigator-confirmed HAE attacks experienced in the period between first date/time of study drug in 
Part 1 and the first dose date/time in Part 2 [or the last dose date/time of dose in Part 1 + 24 hours 
for subjects who discontinued drug in Part 1]) × 28/(date of first dose in Part 2 [or date of last dose in 
Part 1] - date of first dose in Part 1 + 1). Statistical analysis was based on a negative binomial 
regression model. Data on symptoms was recorded by the patient in an electronic diary to which the 
investigators had real time access. 
The primary endpoints used in the phase 2 and 3 studies are considered acceptable given the proposed 
indication for berotralstat in the prophylaxis of HAE. Similar endpoints have been accepted for previous 
applications with a similar indication (e.g. lanadelumab).
In Study 302 subjects were stratified by a single factor, baseline attack rate. There was an error in the 
IXRS equation, which, resulted in the baseline attack rate for screening for purposes of stratification 
being slightly larger than it should have been because the denominator did not include the “+1”; ie, 
the number of days in screening was underestimated by 1 day. For analysis purposes, the baseline 
attack rate was recalculated using the intended equation for baseline attack rate.  This may have 
resulted in some patients being assigned to the incorrect baseline attack rate category (>2 attacks per 
month; <2 attacks per month) in the randomization procedure. Baseline imbalances in the proportion 
of males and females across treatment arms could also be attributable to this calculation error. Apart 
from the stratification error the study appears to have been conducted appropriately.
Efficacy data and additional analyses
In Study BCX7353-302 there was an imbalance by sex across treatment arms, with the proportion of 
females varying from 73.2% in the berotralstat 110mg arm to 57.5% in the berotralstat 150mg arm 
and 66% in the placebo arm. In addition, there was an imbalance with regard to laryngeal attacks in 
the year preceding the study with higher rates in the placebo arm 42.5%, compared to berotralstat 
110mg and 150mg, 24.4% and 22.5% respectively. 
Study BCX7353-302 met its primary endpoint for both berotralstat doses with a greater rate reduction 
(%) from placebo for berotralstat 150mg (-44.2% with 95% CI from -59.5 to -23%, p-value <0.001) 
compared to berotralstat 110mg (-30% with 95% CI from -48.7, -4.6%, p-value=0.024). Investigator 
attack rates over the dosing period were 1.65/28 days for berotralstat 110mg, from a baseline of 
2.97/28 days; 1.31/28 days for berotralstat 150mg from a baseline of 3.06/28 days; and 2.35/28 days 
for placebo, from a baseline of 2.91/28 days. 
A missing data sensitivity analysis conducted on the primary endpoint in which observed data post 
study drug discontinuation was used in combination with imputed data for subjects who discontinued 
study treatment prior to the end of Part 1 and did not continue to record HAE attacks showed an 
attenuation in the effect size for berotralstat 150mg but not for berotralstat 110mg, with a rate 
reduction % from placebo of -35% (95% CI -9.2, -52.9%) as compared to -44.2% in the original 
analysis. As the method for imputing data for subjects with no data on HAE attacks post 
discontinuation was not described in sufficient detail, the applicant was asked to provide clarification on 
the method used and further analysis. Further sensitivity analyses provided by the applicant at  
request of  CHMP has demonstrated a lesser attenuation of effect for the 150 mg dose from 44% to 
39% (using all observed data and imputing remaining missing data under a Jump to Reference 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 120/168
assumption) and from 44% to 40% (imputing all data post-discontinuation of study drug under a Jump 
to Reference assumption). 
The clinical relevance of the effect seen in the primary endpoint was questioned. Effects on quality of 
life were evaluated using change from baseline in AE-QoL at Week 24. There was a decrease in score 
(an improvement) in all treatment arms which were numerically greater than placebo in both 
berotralstat treatment arms. These differences were not statistically significant. This suggests that 
though attack rates were reduced in both active treatment arms, this had a minimal impact on quality 
of life, which could question the clinical importance of the reduction in attack rates. However, the mean 
improvement comparing subjects’ on-study to Baseline AE-QoL total scores was more than twice the 
MCID at Week 24 in Study 302, consistent with the improvement in QoL total scores observed in Study 
301 and Study 204.
The number of days with angioedema symptoms over 24 weeks was similar for both active treatment 
arms (19 and 20 days) and lower than placebo (29 days). There were uncertainties regarding efficacy 
at different attack sites, e.g. abdominal, laryngeal and peripheral etc. and for varying degrees of 
severity. Evaluation of efficacy by attack site was an exploratory endpoint only and though numerically 
there was a reduction in attack rate for abdominal, peripheral and laryngeal attacks in the berotralstat 
treatment arms compared to placebo, these were not nominally significant. Further data provided by 
the applicant has demonstrated that berotralstat 150mg produced a reduction in moderate to severe 
attacks, a reduction in acute attack medication usage and in the rate of laryngeal attacks. 
A pre-planned subgroup analysis in Study 302 showed a greater rate reduction (%) from placebo in 
males in both berotralstat treatment arms compared to females. This was explained by the applicant 
as possibly being due to a larger placebo effect and a higher baseline attack for females compared with 
males in the berotralstat 150mg treatment arms. Additional analyses provided by the applicant 
suggested that the magnitude of the treatment effect on HAE attack rate could be smaller in females 
than males but a definitive conclusion could not be made on the basis of the available data. 
Additionally, there was an imbalance in the proportion of females across treatment arms with 73.2% in 
the berotralstat 110mg arm, 57.5% in the berotralstat 150mg arm and 66% in the placebo arm. Given 
the greater response seen for males, it is possible that the higher rate reduction (%) from placebo 
seen in berotralstat 150mg may have been driven by the larger proportion of males in that treatment 
group (42.5%) compared to that of berotralstat 110mg (26.8%). Additional analyses provided by the 
applicant were not considered to fully exclude this possibility. The CHMP considered that no definite 
conclusion could be drawn from the current data therefore no information is warranted in the SmPC.
BCX7353-204
The efficacy results from this study are difficult to interpret given that it is uncontrolled and study 
participants have been recruited under many different protocol versions. The definition of an attack 
also differs somewhat from that used in the pivotal study with a requirement that the attack have 
begun more than 24 hours after the end of a prior attack, whereas in the pivotal study this time 
interval was 48 hours. Subjects recorded attacks in paper diaries. It is unclear how complete these 
diaries were, albeit that attacks were adjudicated upon by the investigators. 
Baseline attack rates were not calculated according to the applicant because not all subjects entering 
the study had baseline measures collected as some subjects were rolling over from previous studies; 
(2) some subjects were on other prophylactic HAE medications; and (3) some subjects were 
discontinuing androgens that were used as HAE prophylaxis. 
It would appear that the attack rate decreased gradually over time as did the mean proportion of days 
with angioedema symptoms. However, this could be due to discontinuation from the study of 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 121/168
participants who were not demonstrating any benefit and the absence of complete data in the later 
months of the follow up period.
Quality of life data is difficult to interpret as baseline AE-QoL total score was only available for 84 /100 
in the 110mg group and 118/127 (93%) in the 150mg group. The number of study participants with 
available scores continued to diminish over time with 23/100 and 73/127 (57.5%) at Week 48.
Maintenance of effect
Maintenance of effect appears to be maintained for both doses across the time period with a small 
reduction seen at month 6. Additional data provided by the applicant did not demonstrate a decrease 
in effect over time. Given the small sample size and possible individual subjects’ data influence, the 
interpretation of durability of response is not straightforward. However, an effect on HAE attack rate 
seems sustained over time for both 110 mg and 150 mg berotralstat doses. Relevant information on 
maintenance of effect has been mentioned in the SmPC.
Indication
The applicant’s proposal for a broad indication in HAE was not initially supported as the clinical 
development programme recruited only patients with Types 1 and 2 HAE. Two subtypes of HAE 
patients with normal C1INH are also recognised (FXII-HAE) and (U-HAE) in the literature. Upon CHMP 
request, the applicant justified further the extrapolation of efficacy to allow the use also in these 2 
subtypes. From a mechanism of action view point, and also the pathophysiology, classification of HAE 
and role of bradykinin in HAE it can be accepted that therapies targeting the contact system (eg, C1-
INH replacement, BK receptor blockers, and kallikrein inhibitors) have been successful in HAE-C1-INH, 
supporting the concept that angioedema is mediated via BK production. Therefore, the indication will 
not be restricted to types 1 and 2 HAE patients. 
Paediatric data
There was limited exposure in the development programme to berotralstat in adolescent subjects, with 
only 4 subjects aged from 12 to 17 and weighting ≥40Kg exposed to berotralstat in a randomised 
controlled trial. Sub-group analysis by age-group was uninformative. There are very limited data on 
efficacy in adolescents. However, considering similarity of disease and mechanism of action between 
both populations and existing scientific and therapeutic knowledge, the use in adolescent patients was 
considered justified despite the very limited data available. The proposed posology for adolescents is 
the same as that for adults. However, as body weight had a significant effect on berotralstat exposure 
in a Population PK analysis, the CHMP recommended that berotralstat should not be used in patients 
weighing less than 40 Kgs and under 12 years of age.
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The pivotal study (Study BCX7353-302) met its primary endpoint and the effect of treatment is 
considered to be clinically relevant.
The applicant’s proposal for a broad indication in HAE was not initially supported as the clinical 
development programme recruited only patients with Types 1 and 2 HAE. The applicant provided 
justification for use in these 2 subtypes to which the CHMP agreed, therefore the indication will not be 
restricted to types 1 and 2. 
A difference of effect was observed among gender with a greater rate reduction from placebo in males 
in both berotralstat treatment arms compared to females. Additionally, there was an imbalance in the 
proportion of females across treatment arms (73.2% in the berotralstat 110mg arm, 57.5% in the 
berotralstat 150mg arm and 66% in the placebo arm). It could be possible that the difference seen in 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 122/168
the primary endpoint between the two berotralstat doses may have been driven by an imbalance in the 
allocation of females across treatment arms. Overall, there is a potential for lower efficacy in females 
than males, however it remains uncertain, and no definite conclusion could be drawn. 
2.6.  Clinical safety
Patient exposure
The clinical development program for berotralstat is comprised of 14 Phase 1 studies and 5 Phase 2/3 
studies. The table below summarizes all clinical studies completed or ongoing in the berotralstat 
program to date.
A total of 894 subjects have been enrolled in the 19 studies and exposed to at least 1 dose of 
berotralstat; 397 healthy subjects, 7 subjects with renal impairment, 18 subjects with hepatic 
impairment, and 472 subjects with HAE. The total number of exposures to berotralstat was 1314 of 
which 653 exposures were not included in the integrated analyses; 445 exposures in healthy subjects, 
25 exposures in special populations, and 183 exposures in HAE subjects. 
A total of 395 unique subjects with HAE received berotralstat, primarily in multiple-dose studies.> 100 
HAE subjects completed a 48 week visit in Studies 302 and 204 at the proposed marketed dose of 150 
mg QD.( 73 subjects in Study 204 and 30 subjects in Study 302).
The primary placebo-controlled safety populations consist of subjects in Studies 301 and 302.
Study 302, as the largest randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled trial, was used to determine the 
most accurate incidence of adverse reactions. Study 301, as a smaller, less diverse study, provided 
supportive adverse reaction information.
The safety data for 7 studies (5 Studies in healthy subjects [Studies 101, 103, 104, 106, and 113]and 
2 studies in HAE subjects [Studies 204 and 302]) were integrated for presentation in this application. 
The safety data for Study 301 are presented separately and not integrated with the other long-term 
studies in HAE.
Considering differences in study designs and subject populations, in the studies that were integrated, 3 
different subject pools were identified: Phase 1 single-dose studies in healthy subjects; Phase 1 
multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects; Phase 2 and 3 (Phase 2/3) prophylactic long-term studies in 
subjects with Type 1 or 2 HAE (Studies 302 and 204).
Non integrated studies included the phase 3 Study 301 (APeX-J) (pivotal Japanese prophylactic 
indication) and the Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects or special populations DDI studies, renal and 
hepatic impairment, exploratory and B/E for acute HAE indication.

Program
Post finalization of the SCS statistical analysis plan (SAP), a fourth subject pool was identified for 
integration and ad hoc analyses of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) data only. Specific HLA alleles have 
been shown to be associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including rash/hypersensitivity 
reactions and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). However, this analysis did not demonstrate any pattern 
of effect.

Adverse events
Study 302
Table 45: BCX7353-302 Part 1: Overall Summary of TEAEs (Safety Population)
Overall, 83% of berotralstat 110 mg subjects, 85% of berotralstat 150 mg subjects, and 77% of 
placebo subjects experienced a TEAE during Part 1. The number of TEAEs considered drug-related by 
investigators was 42% of berotralstat 110 mg subjects, 38% of berotralstat 150 mg subjects, and 33% 
of placebo subjects.
No subject in the berotralstat 150 mg treatment group experienced a treatment-emergent SAEs. One 
subject (2%) in the berotralstat 110 mg group experienced the treatment-emergent SAE of plasma cell 
myeloma, and 3 placebo-treated subjects (8%) experienced the treatment-emergent SAEs of uterine 
leiomyoma, diverticulum intestinal haemorrhagic and transient ischemic attack (on different dates), 
and pneumonia; none of these events were considered study drug related by the investigator. 
All study drug related TEAEs were mild to moderate in the placebo arm and in the berotralstat 150 mg 
group. Although the majority of related TEAEs in the 110 mg group were mild to moderate 3 subjects 
(7%) were reported as experiencing Grade 3 (severe) drug-related TEAEs on study. The events were 
the events were abdominal pain (2 subjects and purpura (1 subject). There were no study-drug related 
Grade 4 TEAEs. Five subjects discontinued study drug due to TEAEs: 3 berotralstat 110 mg subjects 
(7%), 1 berotralstat 150 mg subject (3%), and 1 placebo subject (3%). 
Skin rash was an event of special interest (EOSI) in this study. There were no drug-related EOSIs on 
study; the single rash identified was an unrelated petechiae due to mechanical irritation. Overall, 42% 
and 50% of berotralstat 110 and 150 mg subjects, respectively, had GI abdominal TEAEs compared 
with 36% of placebo subjects. One berotralstat 110 mg subject (2%) discontinued study drug due to 
GI abdominal TEAEs (Grade 2 dyspepsia, nausea, and vomiting).

Study 204
Table 46: BCX7353-204: Overall Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety 
Population)
Study 204 showed that berotralstat was safe and generally well tolerated and, there was not a well-
defined increase in the frequency of TEAEs with increasing dose. Overall, in the total berotralstat 
group, 206 of 227 subjects (90.7%) experienced a TEAE, with almost equal % between groups. 
Nineteen subjects (8.4%) discontinued study drug due to a TEAE. SAEs assessed by the investigator as 
related to study drug occurred in 3 subjects (1.3%).
Integrated Phase 2/3 Prophylactic Long-term Studies in HAE Subjects
TEAEs that were more frequently reported among berotralstat-treated subjects vs. placebo-treated 
subjects (ie, > 5% difference) were nasopharyngitis (28.4% vs. 23.1%), headache (14.3% vs. 5.1%), 
diarrhoea (12.6% vs. 0), abdominal pain (12.3% vs. 5.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (9.9% vs. 
2.6%), vomiting (7.9% vs. 2.6%), urinary tract infection (6.4% vs. 0), and gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (5.3% vs. 0). Likewise, the TEAEs of nausea (17.9% vs. 11.1%), viral gastroenteritis (7.7% 
vs. 2.0%), pain in extremity (7.7% vs. 1.2%), anxiety (7.7% vs. 2.3%), and irritability (5.1% vs. 0) 
were more frequently reported among placebo-treated subjects (Table S.58.3.A). Overall, among 
subjects treated with berotralstat, the most frequent TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (28.4%), headache 
(14.3%), and diarrhoea (12.6%). The frequency of TEAEs was similar between the berotralstat 110-mg 
and 150-mg dose groups.
The infections and infestations SOC had the greatest number of subjects with a TEAE; 57.9% and 
51.3% of berotralstat- and placebo-treated subjects, respectively. The next most frequently reported 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 126/168
TEAEs were in the GI disorders SOC; 50.0% vs. 41.0% treated with berotralstat and placebo, 
respectively. Most TEAEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity.
48.7% and 45.1% of subjects in the berotralstat 110-mg and150-mg dose groups, respectively, 
experienced a drug-related TEAE. In the GI SOC, 37.1% vs. 28.2% of berotralstat- and placebo-
treated subjects experienced a drug-related TEAE. The GI TEAEs of abdominal pain (8.8%), diarrhoea 
(7.3%), and nausea (7.3%) were the most frequently reported berotralstat-related TEAEs. Other SOCs 
that had at least 2% of berotralstat-treated subjects experiencing a drug-related TEAE were 
investigations, nervous system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and general 
disorders and administration site conditions.
The investigations and GI SOCs (3.2% and 1.5%, respectively) had the most subjects with a drug-
related Grade 3 or Grade 4 TEAE. The most common drug-related Grade 3 or Grade 4 TEAEs reported 
in berotralstat-treated subjects were ALT increased (1.8%) and abdominal pain (1.2%). The only other 
drug-related Grade 3 or Grade 4 TEAEs reported in > 1 subject treated with berotralstat was hepatic 
enzyme increased (0.6%) and LFT abnormal (0.6%).
TEAEs were also evaluated by calculating the rate per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE) to normalize 
for length of time on study and account for differential observation time bias. The per 100 PYE rates of 
TEAEs occurring in at least 5% of the total number of berotralstat exposures are outlined below.

Integrated Phase 1 Single-Dose Studies in Healthy Subjects (Studies 101, 103, 104 and 113)
241 healthy subjects were treated with a single dose of berotralstat. The highest single berotralstat 
dose administered was 871 mg (1000 mg [SN]). Other berotralstat doses included in the > 150 mg 
dose group included 218 mg, 300 mg, and 450 mg.
Subjects in the < 110-mg group and the 150-mg dose groups were younger than subjects in the other 
2 berotralstat dose groups (and slightly younger than placebo) and more female subjects were enrolled 
in the 2 lower berotralstat dose groups compared to the other groups. All subjects were between the 
ages of 18 and 64 years. Subjects treated with berotralstat were enrolled in North America (47.7%) or 
Europe (52.3%). The majority of subjects were white 87.1% followed by Black or African American

5 subjects experienced a TEAE that led to permanent study drug discontinuation. Three of the 5 
subjects were enrolled in the relative bioavailability study, Study 103; the TEAEs of Grade 2 
transaminases increased and Grade 1 eczema were assessed by the investigator as possibly related to

remaining 2 TEAEs were reported in subjects enrolled in the bioequivalence cross-over Study 113; 
Grade 2 sinus infection and Grade 1 abdominal discomfort were assessed as unrelated to study drug.
Integrated Phase 1 Multiple-dose Studies in Healthy Subjects (studies 101 and 106)
78 subjects treated with berotralstat, 54 subjects were treated with a daily dose > 150 mg 
berotralstat, 14 subjects treated with berotralstat 150 mg, and 10 subjects treated with berotralstat 
110 mg. Overall, the mean (SD) duration of study drug dosing was 10.1 (3.61) days in subjects who 
received berotralstat. Just under half of the subjects (47.4%) received > 7 to 28 days of berotralstat

treatment and the mean (SD) daily dose was 273.8 (129.79) mg berotralstat. The highest multiple 
berotralstat dose administered was 500 mg (SN) or 450 mg.
The majority of subjects treated with berotralstat were male (72.7%), white (75.6%), and 64.1% and 
45.5% of berotralstat-treated subjects were enrolled in Europe and North America, respectively.

There were no Grade 4 TEAEs on study and no Grade 3 TEAEs in any berotralstat treated subjects. No 
berotralstat-treated subjects discontinued study drug due to TEAEs in Part 1 of Study 301.
Non-integrated Prophylactic HAE Studies 
a) Phase 2 dose ranging study (study 203)
The most common drug-related TEAEs reported among subjects treated with berotralstat were nausea 
(11.3%), abdominal pain (7.5%), and diarrhoea and fatigue (5.7% each).
Most TEAEs were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) in severity. Overall, 5.7% of subjects (3 of 53) 
treated with berotralstat and no placebo-treated subject experienced a Grade 3 TEAE. All Grade 3 
TEAEs occurred in subjects treated with berotralstat 350 mg and no Grade 3 TEAEs occurred in more 
than 1 subject. Two of the Grade 3 TEAEs (abdominal pain and ALT increased) led to study drug.  2 
subjects (1 subject treated with berotralstat 350 mg [SN] and 1 subject treated with berotralstat 250 
mg [SN]) interrupted study drug due to the TEAEs of fatigue and gastroenteritis (the subject took 1 
additional dose and then discontinued due to liver disorder), and GI infection discontinuation. The 
Grade 3 TEAE of GI infection began 7 days after study drug was completed and resolved 2 days later. 
b) Study 202 dose ranging study acute attack treatment in subjects with HAE
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 133/168
Diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain were the most frequently reported GI events in this study for all 
attacks combined.  GI events occurred in a higher proportion of attacks treated with berotralstat 500 
and 250 mg (20.0% and 19.0%, respectively) compared to the highest dose, 750 mg (9.4%). One 
subject was withdrawn due to moderate (Grade 2) nausea and vomiting considered related to 
berotralstat 500 mg.
Three subjects discontinued study drug after experiencing an AE (Part 1, berotralstat 750 mg: Grade 1 
macular rash in 1 subject; Part 1, placebo: Grade 2 abdominal pain in 1 subject; Part 2, berotralstat 
500 mg: Grade 2 vomiting and nausea in 1 subject). All events were considered related to study drug 
and resolved within 2 days of onset.
Serious adverse events and deaths
No subjects in the Phase 1 single-dose subject pool or in the Phase 1 multiple-dose subject pool 
experienced a treatment-emergent SAE.
One subject in the non-integrated phase 3 study (study 301) experienced a treatment-emergent SAE 
of pneumonia that resulted in hospitalization but was considered by the investigator to be unlikely 
related to study drug.
In study 202, three SAEs occurred in 2 subjects during the study (Part 1, placebo: ligament sprain and 
kidney contusion in 1 subject; Part 2, berotralstat 500 mg SN: ankle fracture). These SAEs were 
considered not related to study drug.
In study 203 a single SAE was reported in a male patient who experienced possible gastrointestinal 
infection (grade 2) which required overnight hospitalisation. The event was not considered related to 
study treatment.
Study 302
One berotralstat 110 mg subject experienced the treatment-emergent SAE of plasma cell myeloma 
diagnosed at Week 8 after follow-up investigations of elevated serum protein present since baseline, 
and 3 placebo subjects experienced a total of 4 SAEs: 1 subject each experienced uterine leiomyoma 
and pneumonia; and 1 subject experienced both a hemorrhagic intestinal diverticulum and a transient 
ischemic attack, occurring on separate occasions. 
No treatment-emergent SAEs were considered related to study treatment.
Study 204
Subjects experiencing a treatment-emergent SAE was reported at 13.2%.
Treatment-emergent SAEs that occurred in > 1 subject were HAE attacks (12 subjects [5.3%]) and 
medical observation (3 subjects [1.3%]). Three subjects (1.3%) experienced 4 treatment-emergent 
SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to study drug; Grade 3 gastroenteritis and Grade 2 
hepatic enzyme increased (n = 1), Grade 3 abnormal LFT (n = 1), and  Grade 3 abdominal pain (n = 
1). The 2 subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs of gastroenteritis, hepatic enzyme increased, and 
abnormal LFT resulted in study drug discontinuation.
Integrated Phase 2/3 prophylactic long-term study population
9.9% of subjects treated with berotralstat and 5.1% of placebo subjects experienced a treatment-
emergent SAE.
No increase in treatment-emergent SAEs was observed with 150 mg compared to 110 mg berotralstat. 
The most common treatment-emergent SAEs reported in subjects treated with berotralstat were HAE

attacks (3.5%) and medical observation (1.2%). A total of 3 subjects (< 1%) experienced 4 
treatment-emergent SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to study drug, all on Study 204.
No deaths have occurred in the berotralstat clinical development program to date.
Laboratory findings
Integrated Phase 1 Single-dose Studies in Healthy Subjects
Overall, 0.8% and 5.6% of berotralstat- and placebo-treated subjects, respectively, experienced a 
Grade 3 laboratory abnormality. No subject experienced a Grade 4 abnormality and no Grade 3 
laboratory abnormality occurred in > 1 subject.
Two subjects experienced a Grade 3 chemistry laboratory abnormality. Grade 3 direct bilirubin of 0.4 
mg/dL 19 days after a single dose of berotralstat 150 mg. The second subject had an ALT increase 
from a baseline value of 63 IU/L (Grade 1) to 124 IU/L (Grade 3).
16 of 241 (6.6%) of berotralstat-treated subjects entered study with mild elevations in ALT, 2 of whom 
(0.8%) had ALT elevations > 1.5 × ULN but < 3 × ULN.
Additionally, 14 of 241 (5.8%) of berotralstat-treated subjects entered study with mild elevations in 
total bilirubin (i.e. > 1 × ULN), 1 of whom (0.4%) had total bilirubin elevations > 1.5 × ULN.
Integrated Phase 1 Multiple-dose Studies in Healthy Subjects 
Three subjects experienced a Grade 3 abnormality no subjects experienced any grade 4 abnormality.  
Two subjects enrolled in Study 101 had a single Grade 3 elevation in lipase that returned to within 
normal range or Grade 1 at the next visit. No signs of pancreatitis were reported. One subject enrolled 
in Study 106 had a 1-grade shift in direct bilirubin to 0.4 mg/dL (Grade 3) on Day 7. At the next visit, 
direct bilirubin was within normal range.
Non-Integrated Phase 3 Long-term Prophylactic Study in HAE Subjects (Study 301)
A single subject treated with placebo experienced the post-baseline Grade 3 laboratory abnormality of 
Grade 3 platelet (laboratory abnormalities were graded by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious 
Diseases (DMID) Adult Toxicity Table (DRAFT, Publish Date: November 2007). The investigator 
considered the event not related to study drug.
Non-integrated Prophylactic HAE Studies phase 2 dose ranging study (study 203)
Four subjects experienced a Grade 3 or Grade 4 treatment-emergent chemistry laboratory 
abnormality; 3 subjects treated with berotralstat 350 mg (SN) and 1 subject treated with berotralstat 
250 mg (SN). Three subjects had a treatment-emergent Grade 3 liver enzyme abnormality (ALT or 
GGT) and 1 subject had a treatment-emergent Grade 4 liver enzyme abnormality (GGT); 3 of the 4 
subjects had elevated liver enzymes at baseline. All 4 patients had previously been treated with 
androgens, though only 2 were treated in the last year. A further patient experienced Grade 3 
leukocytosis as an isolated finding.
Study 302
There were few Grade 3 or Grade 4 laboratory toxicities reported, as graded by DMID, with a similar 
number of such events reported across the treatment groups. Five subjects (6.2%) treated with 
berotralstat experienced DMID Grade 3 laboratory toxicities compared with 4 subjects (10.3%) in the 
placebo treatment group. One subject on 150 mg berotralstat who had previously been exposed to 
androgens had Grade 4 ALT and Grade 3 AST without symptoms or elevation of bilirubin, which

resolved after discontinuing study drug.  No subjects with elevations in ALT and/or AST met the criteria 
of Hy’s law.
Study 204
The most common clinically significant chemistry abnormalities were liver-related abnormalities, and 
the most common abnormality was ALT increased. The majority of treatment-emergent liver 
abnormalities were Grade 1 or Grade 2; however, 13 subjects (5.7%) experienced a treatment-
emergent Grade 3 or Grade 4 ALT, and all of these subjects had previously used androgens.  No 
subjects with elevations in ALT and/or AST met the criteria of Hy’s law.
There were no notable changes over time in the cardiac injury markers (ie, CK-MB, troponin I and 
troponin T). Changes in renal parameters were also unremarkable with no notable mean or individual 
changes in creatinine or CLCR. Additionally, changes over time for the markers of glomerular (UACR) 
and tubular injury (NGAL) did not reveal any effects of berotralstat on the kidneys.  No notable 
changes in vital signs were reported during the study. No subject discontinued due to QT prolongation 
and no subject had treatment emergent QTcF intervals that met stopping criteria.
Events of special interest (EOSI)
EOSI included Rash/hypersensitivity events, GI abdominal events and hepatic disorders.
Although drug-related rash events are reported below for the integrated Phase 1 single- and multiple-
dose studies, a more realistic incidence of drug-related rash events is based on the integrated Phase 
2/3 prophylactic long-term Studies 204 and 302 and the non-integrated Phase 3 long-term 
prophylactic Study 301 in HAE subjects.
Rash/hypersensitivity events,
Non-Integrated Phase 3 Long-term Prophylactic Study in HAE Subjects
(Study 301)
Two subjects treated with berotralstat 150 mg and 1 subject treated with placebo experienced 
investigator-identified rash on study (PTs rash, urticaria, and urticaria, respectively). 
Integrated Phase 2/3 Prophylactic Long-term Studies in HAE Subjects
Overall, 10 subjects (2.9%) treated with berotralstat experienced a drug-related rash/hypersensitivity 
TEAE. No dose response was observed and no rash occurred in the placebo group. The most commonly 
reported rash/hypersensitivity TEAE was rash (5 subjects, 1.5%); all other rash events occurred in 1 
subject each. These included Angioedema, dermatitis psoriasiform, drug eruption, rash generalised, 
rash pruritic and Urticaria.
The single event of angioedema (verbatim term histamine mediated angioedema) was reported on Day 
253 for one subject enrolled in Study 204 who was treated with berotralstat 110 mg. The event was 
Grade 1 in severity and assessed as possibly related to berotralstat. The subject had intermittent 
episodes of histaminergic angioedema, initially thought to be related to berotralstat; however, it was 
later assessed as unlikely related to any sort of allergic reaction to berotralstat. Eight of the rash 
events began within the first month of initiating treatment with berotralstat. 2 subjects interrupted 
treatment and rash did not recur when berotralstat was restarted; and 2 subjects discontinued 
berotralstat due to the rash event. There were no notable differences between berotralstat doses and 
the reports of drug-related rash.
Of note there were no drug-related EOSIs on study 302; the single rash identified was recorded as an 
unrelated petechiae due to mechanical irritation.  In Study 204 Investigators reported drug-related 
rash events as EOSIs in 8 subjects receiving berotralstat.

GI abdominal events
Non-Integrated Phase 3 Long-term Prophylactic Study in HAE Subjects (Study 301).
Overall,6 subjects reported GI abdominal TEAE’s.  3 (50.0% and 42.9%, respectively) berotralstat 110 
and 150 mg subjects each had GI abdominal TEAEs vs. 1 placebo subject (16.7%). None of the GI 
abdominal TEAEs were SAEs, Grade 3 or Grade 4, or led to discontinuation of study drug.
Two GI abdominal TEAEs were reported by 2 subjects each: abdominal discomfort (1 berotralstat 110 
mg treated subject and 1 placebo subject) and abdominal pain and diarrhoea (1 berotralstat 110 and 
150 mg treated subject each). Eleven of the 19 GI abdominal TEAEs experienced by subjects treated 
with berotralstat were considered related to study drug.
Integrated Phase 2/3 Prophylactic Long-term Studies in HAE Subjects
A higher incidence of GI abdominal TEAEs were reported among berotralstat-treated subjects 
compared to placebo-treated subjects (46.2% vs 35.9%). No dose response was observed for the 
berotralstat dose groups. In the total berotralstat treatment group, the most frequently reported GI 
abdominal TEAEs were diarrhoea (12.6%), abdominal pain (12.3%), and nausea (11.1%). The GI 
TEAEs more frequently reported (> 2% difference) in the berotralstat group vs. the placebo group 
were diarrhoea (12.6% vs. 0), abdominal pain (12.3% vs 5.1%), vomiting (7.9% vs 2.6%), abdominal 
pain upper (5.8% vs. 2.6%), flatulence (5.3% vs. 2.6%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (5.3% 
vs. 0). 
Conversely, events occurring more frequently on placebo (> 2% difference) were nausea (17.9% vs. 
11.1%) and abdominal discomfort (7.7% vs 5.0%). Most GI abdominal TEAEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 
in severity and overall, 3.2% of subject discontinued due to a GI abdominal event.
Initially during the first month 107 of 342 subjects (31.3%) reported a GI abdominal TEAE. During 
Month 2, reports of new onset of GI events reporting declined to 9.4%, and by Month 3, 5.2% of 
subjects reported GI abdominal TEAEs. The monthly incidence was similar for Months 4 and 5 (4.9% 
and 4.4%, respectively), and increased slightly to 5.9% in Month 6.
Hepatic events
A strong correlation between elevated transaminases and androgen exposure, particularly close 
temporal association between discontinuation of androgens and initiation of berotralstat, has been 
noted. Section 4.8 of the SmPC includes information regarding prior/recent androgen use as a risk 
factor for LFT elevations during berotralstat use.
No hepatic disorder TEAEs were reported for HAE subjects enrolled in Part 1 of Study 301.
Integrated Phase 2/3 Prophylactic Long-term Studies in HAE Subjects.
Overall, no differences were observed between the berotralstat dose groups and a < 5% difference 
was observed between berotralstat- and placebo-treated subjects. The most commonly reported 
hepatic disorders reported in the berotralstat-treated subjects were ALT increased (4.4%) and AST 
increased (3.2%). No subjects had clinical signs of jaundice, synthetic liver dysfunction, or liver injury.

Studies Safety Population)
Safety in special populations
Subgroup analyses were conducted by gender, race, and ethnicity for all integrated analysis 
population. For the age subgroup, only the integrated Phase 2/3 prophylactic long-term studies in HAE 
subjects were analysed.
Gender
Gender was tested as a covariate in the population PK model but was not found to have a significant 
effect on PK of berotralstat.
Among the berotralstat-treated subjects in the integrated Phase 1 single-dose studies, Subgroup 
analysis by gender was not associated with a different safety risk than observed in the overall 
population. Overall TEAEs were numerically higher for female subjects compared to male subjects, 
42.2% vs. 31.1%, primarily due to Grade 1 TEAEs.  Laboratory abnormalities were higher among 
female subjects compared to male subjects (43.8% vs. 29.4%), there was no difference in Grade 3 or 
Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities.
A similar picture was seen in Phase 1 multiple-dose studies but gender was not associated with a 
different safety risk than observed in the overall population. However, some differences were 
observed. The incidence of overall TEAEs was higher for female subjects compared to male subjects, 
16 of 19 subjects (84.2%) vs. 36 of 59 subjects (61.0%).  More female subjects experienced a GI 
abdominal TEAE, 12 of 19 subjects (63.2%) vs. 18 of 59 subjects (30.5%) of male subjects. More 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 138/168
female subjects had a graded laboratory abnormality, 15 of 19 subjects (78.9%) vs. 34 of 59 subjects 
(57.6%), although most abnormalities were Grade 1 in severity.
More male subjects experienced a potentially clinically significant QTcF value, 22 of 59 subjects 
(37.3%) vs. 4 of 19 female subjects (21.1%); 21 of the 26 subjects with threshold QTcF values had 
received ≥ 150 mg berotralstat.
Age
The effect of age on clearance of berotralstat was modest in the population PK model. No dose 
adjustments are proposed for adolescents or elderly patients.
Overall, among berotralstat-treated subjects in the integrated Phase 2/3 prophylactic long-term 
studies, 16 of 342 subjects (4.7%) were adolescents, 312 of 342 subjects were adults (91.2%), and 
14 of 342 subjects (4.1%) were elderly subjects.
The adolescent group had the lowest proportion of subjects with reported TEAEs, 13 of 16 subjects 
(81.3%), vs. 283 of 312 adult subjects (90.7%), and 13 of 14 elderly subjects (92.9%)`. The elderly 
group had the highest incidence of Grade 3 or Grade 4 TEAEs; 3 of 14 elderly subjects (21.4%), vs. 40 
of 312 adult subjects (12.8%), and 2 of 16 adolescent subjects (12.5%).
The elderly age group had the highest proportion of subjects who discontinued study drug due to a 
TEAE; 2 of 14 subjects (14.3%) vs. 25 of 312 adult subjects (8.0%), and 1 of 16 adolescent subjects 
(6.3%).
A higher incidence of potentially drug-related hepatic disorders was observed in the elderly adult age 
group, 3 of 14 subjects (21.4%) compared to 22 of 312 adult subjects (7.1%), and 0 adolescent 
subjects.
A higher incidence of GI abdominal TEAEs was reported in elderly subjects, 8 of 14 elderly subjects 
(57.1%) vs. 145 of 312 adult subjects (46.5%) and 5 of 16 adolescent subjects (31.3%).
A higher incidence of graded laboratory abnormalities occurred in the elderly age group, 13 of 14 
elderly subjects (92.9%) compared to 270 of 312 adult subjects (86.5%) and 13 of 16 adolescent 
subjects (81.3%). Additionally, the incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities was also 
higher in the elderly group, 3 of 14 elderly subjects (21.4%) vs. 28 of 312 adult subjects (9.0%) and 2 
of 16 adolescent subjects (12.5%).
No adolescent subject had a post baseline ALT elevation > 3 × ULN compared to 1 of 14 elderly 
subjects (7.1%) and 15 of 312 adult subjects (4.8%). The lack of ALT elevation among adolescent 
subjects may be due to low relative androgen exposure.
Race
Four categories of race were evaluated: white, black or African American, Asian, and Other Race was 
tested as a covariate in the population PK model but was not found to have a significant effect on PK of 
berotralstat.
Generally, subgroup analysis by race was not associated with a different safety risk than observed in 
the overall population. Overall, there was a higher percentage of white patients compared to other 
races and some individual differences were observed, but different safety profile base on race is not 
expected.
Hepatic Impairment
No subgroup analyses by hepatic impairment were conducted for the pooled populations.
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 139/168
Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 studies, subjects were excluded if they had elevated ALT or AST values 
at screening (ie, ≥ 2 × ULN for healthy subjects or ≥ 3 × ULN for HAE subjects).
A Phase 1 study, Study 108, was designed to evaluate the PK and safety of berotralstat in subjects 
with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.
The increases in plasma concentrations of berotralstat in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment were not clinically significant based on accumulated knowledge of berotralstat safety from 
clinical studies. No dose adjustment of berotralstat is necessary in subjects with mild, moderate, or 
severe hepatic impairment. However, in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, the 
increased risk of prolonged QT associated with increased serum berotralstat concentrations is 
mentioned in the product information. In these patients berotralstat should be avoided.
Renal Impairment
No subgroup analyses by renal impairment were conducted for the pooled populations. A Phase 1 
study, Study 107, was designed to evaluate the PK and safety of berotralstat in subjects with varying 
degrees of renal impairment.
Subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2; not yet on dialysis) had a 5-fold 
lower CLR of berotralstat than matched healthy subjects. When compared to a concurrent cohort with 
normal renal function (CLCR greater than 90 mL/min); Cmax was increased by 47%, while AUC0-last 
was increased by 14%. This just under threshold for risk of QT concern.
At steady state, it would be anticipated that the GM Cmax of berotralstat in subjects with renal 
impairment would be increased to approximately 220 ng/mL from approximately 160 ng/mL in healthy 
subjects administered berotralstat for 14 days (Study 106), with no increase in GM AUC anticipated.
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation
There is no data on the background risk of birth defects in this population. There is no proven 
association of HAE with other genetic diseases.
In total, 3 pregnancies have been reported across the berotralstat clinical development program, 2 
subject pregnancies and 1 partner pregnancy. One subject pregnancy is ongoing. The estimated foetal 
study drug exposure was 24 days.  One subject pregnancy with an estimated foetal drug exposure of 8 
to 29 days resulted in live birth of a healthy girl during week 38 of pregnancy. The partner pregnancy 
resulted in live birth of a healthy girl during week 39 of her pregnancy. 
The SmPC section 4.6 states as a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
berotralstat during pregnancy.
Special populations
A brief summary of TEAEs and Grade 3 or 4 clinical laboratory abnormalities reported in elderly 
subjects is shown in Table 61. Subjects randomized to placebo were observed for only 24 weeks prior 
to re-randomizing to active drug. The overall summary of safety for adults 18 to 64 years of age is

TEAEs leading to discontinuation
Two elderly berotralstat-treated subjects discontinued due to TEAEs:

Subject, a 74-year-old female receiving berotralstat 110 mg, experienced Grade 3 multiple 
purpura on Day 129. The event was considered probably related to study drug. There were no 
laboratory abnormalities observed; specifically, the subject had no clinically significant changes 
from baseline in chemistry, hematology, and coagulation laboratory findings throughout the 
study. The subject discontinued study drug on Day 138 but continued to experience purpura. 
The subject reported a resolution of the event 78 days after discontinuing berotralstat. A 
narrative for this subject is provided in Section 14.3.3 of the Study 302 Part 1 interim CSR.

Subject, a 69-year-old female receiving berotralstat 150 mg, experienced Grade 1 palpitations 
on Day 172 and Grade 1 tachycardia on Day 183. Study drug was withdrawn as a result of 
these events. The events were considered possibly related to study drug. Electrocardiograms

and 80 bpm and corrected QT interval using Fridericia’s method [QTcF] ranging from 409.34 to 
425.05 msec with a change from BL < 30 msec at all timepoints). A narrative for this subject is

One elderly berotralstat-treated subject had a post-BL ALT > 3 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) and 
no subjects had any other post-BL liver function test > 3 × ULN (Table 7). No elderly subjects 
experienced transaminase elevations during placebo treatment. Most transaminase elevations occurred 
in conjunction with recent androgen discontinuation, which was prohibited in Study 302, where all 
placebo subjects enrolled.
Three elderly subjects experienced potentially drug-related hepatic disorders, as shown in Table 66.

GI abdominal TEAEs
GI abdominal TEAEs were reported in 57.1% of elderly subjects on berotralstat (62.5% on 110 mg and 
50.0% on 150 mg). In the adult non-elderly (18 to 64 years) berotralstat-treated population, GI 
abdominal events were reported in 46.5% of the population (48.6% on 110 mg and 44.7% on 150 
mg).
The most common GI abdominal TEAEs in elderly subjects receiving berotralstat were flatulence 
(28.6%); diarrhoea; abdominal discomfort, abdominal distention, and nausea (14.3% each). In adults, 
the most common GI abdominal TEAEs were diarrhoea (13.1%), abdominal pain (12.8%), nausea 
(11.2%) and vomiting (8.3%). Nausea occurred more frequently in the placebo treated subjects. There 
were no GI abdominal TEAEs that were SAEs or led to discontinuation of berotralstat. An unrelated 
Grade 3 GI event of large intestine polyp occurred in a subject who switched from placebo to 110 mg. 
All other GI TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2.
Immunological events
N/A
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
The effects of berotralstat on CYP drug-metabolizing enzymes are dose-dependent, with greater 
degrees of inhibition observed at 350 mg [SN] QD compared to 150 mg QD. 
An in vivo drug interaction study (Study 102) conducted with sensitive substrates for CYP3A 
(midazolam), CYP2C9 (tolbutamide), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan) 
suggested that berotralstat at 350◦mg [SN] QD is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (approximate 8-fold 
increase in AUC), a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and intestinal CYP3A4 (exposure 
increased between 2- and 4-fold), and a weak inhibitor of hepatic CYP3A4 (< 2-fold increase in 
exposure).
A second “cocktail study” was conducted to evaluate the interaction on the sensitive CYP substrates 
already tested in Study 102 to definitively inform the drug interaction liability of berotralstat on 
CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 at the clinically relevant dose of 150◦mg QD (Figure 19). At 
150◦mg QD, berotralstat is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 (approximate 2-fold increase in AUC) and 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 146/168
CYP2D6 enzyme activities (approximate 3-fold increase in AUC); and weak inhibitor of hepatic CYP2C9 
enzyme activity (< 2-fold increase in AUC).
The AUC and Cmax of the CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole were increased less than 25% with 
concomitant administration of berotralstat and the metabolic ratio of omeprazole:5-hydroxy 
omeprazole was unchanged with concomitant administration of berotralstat; therefore, berotralstat is 
not considered an inhibitor of CYP2C19.
Berotralstat 150 mg QD reduced the exposure of danazol (CYP3A and CYP2D6 substrate) by 
approximately 25%, primarily due to lower Cmax. Berotralstat 150 mg is a weak inhibitor of 
amlodipine (CYP3A substrate) metabolism, increasing exposure < 2-fold. The exposure of desipramine, 
a sensitive CYP2D6 substrate, increased approximately 2-fold.
CYP2D6 is a polymorphic enzyme, and variations of the gene give rise to alleles resulting in no, 
decreased, normal or increased enzymatic activity. In Studies 102, 112, and 115, subjects with no 
enzymatic activity and increased enzymatic activity, known as poor and ultra-rapid metabolizers, 
respectively, were excluded. 
An early in vivo drug interaction study (Study 105) was performed to investigate the potential for 
berotralstat 350 mg (SN) QD to interact with probe substrates digoxin (P-gp substrate) and 
rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate). Berotralstat 350 mg was a weak inhibitor of P-gp, increasing exposure 
to digoxin by approximately 50%. Berotralstat 350 mg (SN) was not an inhibitor of BCRP, as 
rosuvastatin exposure was decreased by approximately 20%.
In summary, at clinical dose of berotralstat 150 mg QD, the CYP and P-gp inhibitory effects of 
berotralstat are unlikely to be of clinical importance except for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 
It is recommended that such medications are appropriately monitored, either through therapeutic drug 
monitoring or assessment of exaggerated PD effects of the offended drug.

Discontinuation due to AES
Integrated Phase 2/3 Prophylactic Long-term Studies in HAE Subjects
Overall, 8.2% and 2.6% of subjects treated with berotralstat and placebo, respectively, experienced a 
TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation. No dose response was observed. The most common TEAEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation were in the GI disorders and investigations SOCs (3.2% and 
2.6%, respectively). The most common TEAE leading to discontinuation of study was ALT increased 
(1.2%); the next most common TEAEs that led to discontinuation each occurred in 0.9% of subjects 
and included upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and liver function test abnormal.
Most berotralstat-treated subjects with TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation occurred in 
subjects enrolled in Study 204 (19 of 28 subjects [67.9%]), had TEAEs that were considered related to 
berotralstat (24 of 28 subjects [85.7%]), and most subjects recovered. One subject (Subject 106-410) 
with ALT and AST increased withdrew consent and no additional follow-up data were available and the 
treatment-emergent SAEs for 2 subjects, plasma cell myeloma and acute myelomonocytic leukaemia, 
respectively, were ongoing at the time of discontinuation. 
Integrated Phase 1 Single-dose and Multiple-dose Studies in Healthy Subjects
Two percent of subjects in the Integrated Phase 1 Single-dose Studies in Healthy Subjects discontinued 
due to TEAEs. Two AE of Grade 2 transaminases increase and Grade 1 eczema were assessed by the 
investigator as possibly related to study drug In the Integrated Phase 1 Multiple-dose Studies in 
Healthy Subjects 3.8% discontinued study treatment due to TEAEs. (3 subjects in the berotralstat dose 
group > 150 mg upper abdominal pain, diarrhoea and non-cardiac chest pain).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
The safety of berotralstat has been evaluated overall in 14 Phase 1 clinical studies and 5 Phase 2 or 3 
clinical studies in HAE subjects.
3 separate subject pools provided integrated data from 241 single-dose berotralstat-treated healthy 
subjects (doses ranged from 8.7 to 871 mg), 78 multiple-dose berotralstat-treated healthy subjects 
(doses ranged from 110 to 450 mg for 7 to 14 days), and 342 subjects with HAE treated long-term at 
QD doses of 110 or 150 mg. The latter subject pool in HAE subjects was comprised of 1 pivotal 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 Study 302 and 1 Phase 2 long-term safety Study 204. 
Safety data from a second Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Study 301 provides 
non-integrated, stand-alone, berotralstat-treated safety data at QD doses of 110 or 150 mg in subjects 
with HAE enrolled at 10 sites in Japan. However, this is limited as only 13 patients were enrolled.
In addition, 9 non-integrated Phase 1 studies provide berotralstat-treated data from 182 healthy 
subjects (doses ranged from 150 mg to 675 mg), 7 subjects with renal impairment (200-mg dose), 
and 18 subjects with hepatic impairment (150-mg dose).
Two non-integrated Phase 2 studies provided berotralstat-treated safety data in subjects with HAE; the 
28-day prophylactic Study 203 and the acute (2 single active liquid doses) Study 202 provided 
berotralstat-treated safety data for 58 HAE subjects (doses ranged from 218 to 650 mg).
The main safety data in the HAE population and intended dose of 150mg arises from the pivotal phase 
3 study 302 and the phase 2 study 204.

Study 302
In this study, overall berotralstat treatment appears safe and well tolerated at both treatment doses.
During Part 1, 34 of 41 berotralstat 110 mg subjects (82.9%), 34 of 40 berotralstat 150 mg subjects 
(85.0%), and 30 of 39 placebo subjects (77%) experienced a TEAE. 
The drug related TEAEs most frequently reported were related to GI disturbances.  Nausea, dyspepsia 
and diarrhoea were the most frequently reported drug related events.  With the exception of nausea 
(which was more frequently reported in the placebo group [15% vs 9%]) the events were more 
frequently reported in the berotralstat treatment groups.  Dyspepsia was more frequently reported in 
the berotralstat 110mg vs 150 mg group and diarrhoea was more frequently reported in the 
berotralstat 150 mg group.
During Part 1, 1 (2%) berotralstat 110 mg subjects, no berotralstat 150 mg subjects, and 3 (8%) 
placebo subjects experienced a treatment-emergent SAE.
Skin rash was an EOSI in this study. There were no drug-related EOSIs on study; the single rash 
identified was recorded as an unrelated petechiae due to mechanical irritation. 
There were few DMID Grade 3 or Grade 4 laboratory toxicities reported, with a similar number of such 
events reported across the treatment groups. Five subjects (6.2%) treated with berotralstat 
experienced DMID Grade 3 laboratory toxicities compared with 4 subjects (10.3%) in the placebo 
treatment group. One subject on 150 mg berotralstat who had previously been exposed to androgens 
had Grade 4 ALT and Grade 3 AST without symptoms or elevation of bilirubin, which resolved after 
discontinuing study drug.
Study 204 is an ongoing Phase 2 open-label safety study designed to assess the long-term safety and 
effectiveness of berotralstat as a prophylactic treatment for HAE. 
Overall, oral treatment with berotralstat 150 mg and 110 mg QD was safe and generally well tolerated. 
No new safety signals were identified, safety risks were consistent with the risks previously noted. No 
subjects experienced a TEAE that led to death. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (30.8%), headache (17.6%), abdominal 
pain (13.2%), and diarrhoea (13.2%). 
Overall, 13.2% of subjects experienced a treatment-emergent SAE. Three subjects (1.3%) experienced 
4 treatment-emergent SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to study drug;  Grade 3 
gastroenteritis and  Grade 2 hepatic enzyme increased (n = 1),  Grade 3 abnormal LFT (n = 1), and  
Grade 3 abdominal pain (n = 1). The 2 subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs of gastroenteritis, 
hepatic enzyme increased, and abnormal LFT resulted in study drug discontinuation.
In addition, 27 subjects (11.9%) interrupted study drug due to TEAEs. The most common TEAE that 
led to study drug interruption was HAE attack in 5 subjects (2.2%). Overall, TEAEs in the GI SOC led 
to study drug interruption in the greatest number of subjects. Overall, 6 subjects (2.6%) discontinued 
study drug due to a GI TEAE; 2 subjects (2.0%) and 4 subjects (3.1%) in the berotralstat 110-mg and 
150-mg dose groups, respectively.
For this study, non-serious treatment-emergent rashes were considered EOSIs for investigator-
reporting purposes. Overall, 8 subjects (3.5%) had rash EOSIs assessed by the investigator as related 
to study drug. There were no serious rash events and all drug-related rash events were Grade 1 or 
Grade 2 in severity.
GI events were considered a potential safety signal; 105 subjects (46.3%) experienced a GI abdominal 
TEAE and 6 subjects (2.6%) discontinued due to a GI abdominal event. The most common GI 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 149/168
abdominal TEAEs were diarrhoea (13.2%), abdominal pain (13.2%), and nausea (7.9%). No dose 
response was observed.  Most events were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity, most events occurred 
within the first month of initiating berotralstat.
The most common clinically significant chemistry abnormalities were liver-related abnormalities, and 
the most common abnormality was ALT increased. The majority of treatment-emergent liver 
abnormalities were Grade 1 or Grade 2; however, 13 subjects (5.7%) experienced a treatment-
emergent Grade 3 or Grade 4 ALT, and all of these subjects had previously used androgens.
 For the integrated Phase 2/3 analysis, TEAEs were also evaluated by calculating the rate per 100 
patient years of exposure (PYE) to normalize for length of time on study and account for differential 
observation time bias. The per 100 PYE rates of TEAEs occurring in at least 5% of the total number of 
berotralstat exposures. The results of the analyses of rates of TEAEs per 100 PYE were consistent with 
those for subject incidence of TEAEs. The events of diarrhoea, headache, and abdominal pain had the 
largest differences in rate per 100 PYE relative to placebo.  
ADRs were identified in study 302 and the integrated phase 2/3 long-term study data.  
Nasopharyngitis, nausea and dyspepsia, occurred at a higher or similar rate on placebo as on 150 mg 
berotralstat and were not included as ADRs. ADRs were calculated based on an analysis of AEs in ≥ 
10% of subjects with a ≥ 5% difference to placebo. The most common berotralstat ADRs, occurring in 
≥ 10% of subjects with a ≥ 5% difference to placebo, were abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, and 
back pain. URTi, Headache was frequently reported AE in the phase 2 and phase 3 studies. 
Abdominal pain, headache, vomiting and diarrhoea are included as ADRs in Section 4.8.  Back pain is 
not proposed to be included due to occurrence in the study that is lower than would be expected 
according to global prevalence of back pain.
In their responses the applicant provides further discussion on URTI and headache ADRs with respect 
to their inclusion in the SmPC. In relation to URTIs the applicant argues that although individual PTs 
show a difference in incidence between berotralstat and placebo groups, when looking at the medical 
concept of ‘common cold’ (which encompasses several PTs relating to differ verbatim of, presumably, 
the same illness), and shown as a Rate per 100 person-years of Exposure, no imbalance is observed. 
The same results (lack of an imbalance) are observed when HLT of URTI (as Rate per 100 person-
years of Exposure) is reviewed. These explanations are acceptable and URTI does not need to be 
placed in Section 4.8 of the SmPC based on evidence available.
The relative frequency of events of headache is larger in all berotralstat groups compared to placebo, 
including when expressed as events per 100 PYE despite placebo group having more patients with a 
history of headache. It should also be taken into account that the investigators defined events of 
headache as possibly/probably/definitely related to berotralstat (both doses) in 21.8% (12/55) of 
cases. Based on all of the above, a causal relationship between headache and berotralstat is a 
reasonable possibility.  Due to the fact that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
between berotralstat and headache the ADR of headache is included in Section 4.8 SmPC.
Overall, 9.9% of subjects (12.7%;110mg and (7.6%;150mg) treated with berotralstat and 5.1% of 
placebo subjects experienced a treatment-emergent SAE. The most common treatment-emergent 
SAEs reported in subjects treated with berotralstat were HAE attacks (3.5%) and medical observation 
(1.2%).  A total of 3 subjects (< 1%) experienced 4 treatment-emergent SAEs assessed by the 
investigator as related to study drug (gastroenteritis, hepatic enzyme increased, abdominal pain, LFTs 
increased). The most common treatment-emergent SAE events per 100 PYE were also HAE attacks and 
medical observation. All other treatment-emergent SAE events per 100 PYE was < 1.
No deaths occurred during any of the clinical studies.

Page 150/168
A 120-day safety update was provided during the assessment, which includes all subject data through 
1 December 2019 for Studies 204 and 302. Broadly speaking it may be agreed that there were no new 
safety signals identified as part of this analysis. In this integrated analysis of phase 2/3 prophylactic 
studies 204 and 203 10.5% of subjects treated with berotralstat and 5.1% placebo subjects 
experienced a treatment-emergent SAE. SAEs in the berotralstat 110/150 mg treatment group 
included HAE attack n=4, pneumonia n=1, enteritis n=1 and cholelithiasis (n = 2), acute myocardial 
infarction (n = 1), and syncope (n = 1) in the berotralstat 150 mg treatment group. None of the newly 
reported SAEs were considered by reporting investigator to be related to berotralstat.  The CHMP 
agreed with the applicant that these events (included the MI which occurred in a 41-year-old woman 
who had significant cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, history of 
transient ischemic attack, intra-cerebral aneurysm, anaemia, tobacco abuse, and carotid artery 
dissection) were unrelated to treatment.
In terms of updated data on dropouts and discontinuations, there was a similar proportion of subjects 
in the 2 berotralstat treatment groups having discontinued study drug (30.4% of patients in the 
110mg followed by 150mg group versus 28.3% of patients in the 150mg group). Similar reasons for 
withdrawal were cited between the groups, with the exception of perceived lack of efficacy 15.8% in in 
the 110mg followed by 150mg group versus 9.4% of patients in the 150mg group). Similar proportions 
of patients discontinued due to TEAEs (7% in the 110mg followed by 150mg group v 9.4% in the 150 
mg group) though it is noted the number of patients who had dose interrupted due to study drug was 
twice as large in the 150mg group (6.3% of the 110mg followed by 150 mg group vs 12.6% in the 
150mg group).There were 4 additional subjects (1 subject in the 110/150 mg dose group and 3 
subjects in the 150 mg dose group) who discontinued study drug to cut off date of the SUR. New 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation included the following: blood creatine phosphokinase(CPK) increased 
and troponin T increased (n = 1, Subject 204-013-401) in the 110/150 mg dose group; diarrhoea and 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; n = 1, Subject 204-035-401), folliculitis (n = 1, Subject 204-
080-402), and systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1, Subject 204-106-407) in the 150 mg dose group. 
The rapporteur notes the additional event of blood CPK increased and troponin T increased which 
occurred in a 22 year old male patient who experienced intermittent elevations in CPK and Troponin T 
approximately 9 months after initiating treatment in the 110mg treatment group in the context of non-
clinical data which identified the potential of cardiac injury. The applicant was requested to discuss this 
case in the context of the potential for cardiac injury and to present the cumulative data to date for 
events relating to myocardial muscle injury (comparing the frequency in treated patients to placebo 
patients). It can be agreed that to date there have not been any observations which suggest cardiac 
injury that is associated with the use of berotralstat.
No new drug-related rash or hepatic events were reported through the cut-off date for this safety 
update (ie, 20 August 2019 through 1 December 2019). There was one new Grade 3 or 4 laboratory 
abnormality (a single, transient Grade 3 result for Leukocytes on day 507 in a patient treated in the 
110mg followed by 150mg group).
In terms of ECG findings, of the 2511 ECG assessments among berotralstat-treated subjects during the 
reporting period through 1 December 2019, 5.7% met a QTcF protocol-defined threshold (ie, QTcF 
threshold > 450 to ≤ 480 msec, > 480 to ≤ 500 msec, or a change from baseline (CFB) of > 30 to ≤ 
60 msec); no subjects met the QTcF threshold > 500 msec or a CFB > 60 msec. No events 
representing arrhythmias were reported. 
TEAE in the single-dose group (6.2%) and diarrhoea was the most frequently-reported TEAE in the 
multiple-dose group (23.1%) Mild to moderate GI abdominal events were observed with a higher 
incidence at multiple berotralstat once-daily doses of > 150 mg. The most frequent GI abdominal 
TEAEs with single and/or multiple doses of berotralstat included diarrhoea, nausea, and abdominal 
pain.
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 151/168
Overall, 3 potential safety signals were identified from the integrated and non-integrated Phase 1 
studies: QT prolongation, drug-related rash, and LFT elevations.
The safety profile observed for berotralstat in the non-integrated Phase 1 studies (182 healthy 
subjects, 7 subjects with severe renal impairment, and 18 subjects with hepatic impairment) was 
consistent with the integrated study pools, with no new safety signals identified.
Special populations included investigation in patients with renal and hepatic impairment.
While subjects with severe renal impairment excreted 4-fold lower amounts of the administered dose 
of berotralstat in urine as unchanged drug than and had a 5-fold lower renal clearance (CLR) than 
matched healthy subjects. Although <3% of administered drug was excreted in the urine in matched 
healthy subjects, No dose adjustment of berotralstat in renal impairment is proposed by the applicant. 
In patients with hepatic impairment plasma berotralstat Cmax was approximately 27% higher in 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment than in matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic 
function, while AUCs were roughly equivalent between the 2 groups. Plasma exposure of berotralstat 
was increased the most in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Plasma berotralstat Cmax and 
AUC0-inf were approximately 77% and 78% higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than 
in matched healthy subjects, respectively. The increase in plasma berotralstat Cmax and AUC0-inf 
were approximately 50% and 38%, respectively, for the combined group of moderate and severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Potentially drug related hepatic disorders were observed in the clinical studies. In the dose finding 
studies, patients with a history of prior androgen use demonstrated an imbalance in terms of 
elevations >3 ULN for ALT, AST and bilirubin when patients treated with 350mg and 250mg 
berotralstat are compared to those treated with placebo. Similar findings from the phase 2/3 
prophylactic long-term studies were observed, so findings may not be purely confounding from the 
prior androgen and a causal relationship to berotralstat seems likely. It is noteworthy that half of the 
patients in study 203 who experienced elevations>3ULN were unresolved at follow up. 
Furthermore, it is noted that while no patient across the clinical development program met the criteria 
for Hy’s Law there were a number of patients treated with berotralstat in thee phase 2/3 prophylactic 
long-term studies who fell into “Temple’s Corollary” (elevated ALTs but not total bilirubin) versus none 
for placebo when maximum total bilirubin vs. maximum ALT was plotted for these patients as part of 
the Hy's Law Plot presented by the applicant (Figure S.41.3).At this stage in clinical development it is 
uncertain if hepatic injury could occur in a larger treatment population. Hepatotoxicity has been 
identified by the applicant as a potential risk in the summary of safety concerns and this is endorsed.
QTc effects in the clinical studies performed sporadic cases of QTc prolongation occurred in some of the 
studies where ECG tracing was conducted however a strong signal was not demonstrated. In dose 
finding phase 2 study 203 no dose effect was observed and no findings >450msec or a change from 
baseline was seen. There were no dose response or notable changes from baseline in the experimental 
measure of renal tubular injury NGAL or cardiac CK-MB, Troponin I, or Troponin T biomarkers. Vital 
sign data (ie, diastolic BP, systolic BP, HR) and ECG data remained relatively constant throughout 
treatment with no marked differences between the berotralstat treatment groups or between 
berotralstat group and placebo. However, in light of the concerns raised in the PD section on 
estimation of the risk, and in light of a number of potentially overlapping risks could potentially result 
in increased exposure as well as increased risk of QT prolongation updates to the SmPC regarding risk 
of QT prolongation have been agreed to and ’QT prolongation’ is considered a potential risk.
A number of DDI studies were conducted and the results suggested that berotralstat was a moderate 
inhibitor of CYP2D6 (approximate 3-fold increase in AUC) and CYP3A4 (approximate 2-fold increase in 
AUC), and a weak inhibitor of hepatic CYP2C9 (< 2-fold increase in AUC). The AUC and Cmax of the 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 152/168
CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole were increased less than 25% with concomitant administration of 
berotralstat and the metabolic ratio of omeprazole:5-hydroxy omeprazole was unchanged with 
concomitant administration of berotralstat; therefore, berotralstat is not considered an inhibitor of 
CYP2C19.
This is adequately reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC.
Overall, among berotralstat-treated subjects in the integrated Phase 2/3 prophylactic long-term 
studies, 16 of 342 subjects (4.7%) were adolescents, 312 of 342 subjects were adults (91.2%), and 
14 of 342 subjects (4.1%) were elderly subjects.
The number of elderly population enrolled was low. The elderly experienced highest incidence of Grade 
3 or Grade 4 TEAEs, were the highest proportion of subjects who discontinued study drug due to a 
TEAE.
Also, the elderly had a higher incidence of potentially drug-related hepatic disorders, GI abdominal 
TEAS, and had a higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities compared to 
adolescents and adults. While it is agreed that the reported rates of TEAEs and SAEs, do not appear to 
identify specific concerns in relation to age, there is uncertainty relating to the applicant’s position that 
differences in incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs and discontinuations due to TEAEs are an artefact of the 
smaller elderly population, and indeed uncertainty around the characterisation of the safety profile in 
elderly patients in general. There are also specific concerns relating to QT prolongation with 
berotralstat in the context of risk factors for increased exposure including moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment, severe renal impairment, low body weight and concomitant medications which is 
concerning in the context of use in elderly, given that these risk factors are common in elderly 
patients, who are themselves already at increased risk of QT prolongation. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
The safety profile observed to date appears to indicate that berotralstat is a safe and generally well-
tolerated treatment for HAE patients.  The most common adverse events associated with treatment are 
mostly GI disturbances such as abdominal pain, vomiting nausea and diarrhoea as well as 
transaminase elevations, headache and rash. Hepatotoxicity has been identified as a potential risk in 
the summary of safety concerns and this is endorsed by CHMP.
Due to the potential risk of QTc prolongation, in patients with severe renal impairment, it is preferable 
to avoid the use of berotralstat. If treatment is required, appropriate monitoring (e.g. ECGs) should be 
considered as mentioned in the SmPC in section 4.4.
Cardiac effects were identified as a safety concern from nonclinical studies. While abnormalities in ECG 
were of borderline clinical significance, it is noted that in the exposure-response analysis, there was a 
statistically significant positive relationship between ΔΔQTcF and berotralstat concentration. Therefore, 
the SmPC has been amended to reflect the potential risk of QT prolongation and recommend that it is 
preferable to avoid the use of berotralstat in these patients. If treatment would be required, 
appropriate monitoring (e.g. ECGs) should be considered.

In conclusion the CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable.
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance
Pharmacovigilance system
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 3 December 2020. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.
2.9.  New Active Substance
The applicant compared the structure of berotralstat with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them. 
2.10.  Product information
2.10.1.  User consultation
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Orladeyo (berotralstat) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 159/168
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
The applicant is seeking an indication for the routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary 
angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older.
Hereditary angioedema is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited condition, which can be disabling 
painful and occasionally life threatening. The most common form of the condition affecting about 85% 
those with HAE, known as Type 1 HAE is caused by a deficiency of the C 1 inhibitor. Roughly 15% have 
Type 2 HAE where C1 inhibitor levels may be normal but the C1 inhibitor has a reduced function. C 1 
inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates a number of inflammatory pathways including 
controlling the production of bradykinin. Patients with HAE have intermittent cutaneous or mucosal 
swellings, that typically evolve over a number of hours and can persist for a few days. The orofacial 
region, abdominal viscera, the peripheries and occasionally the larynx may be affected. Laryngeal 
attacks can be life threatening. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
Two medicinal products are currently licensed for the prophylaxis of HAE attacks. There are also a 
number of products licensed for the treatment of acute attacks. 
Cinryze (C1 inhibitor derived from human plasma) is licensed for routine prophylaxis of attacks in 
adults, adolescents and children (6 years and above) with severe and recurrent attacks of hereditary 
angioedema (HAE), who are intolerant to or insufficiently protected by oral prevention treatments, or 
patients who are inadequately managed with repeated acute treatment. Initially the medicinal product 
is administered intra-venously every 3 to 4 days.
Takhzyro (lanadelumab) a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits active plasma kallikrein 
activity, thereby limiting production of bradykinin is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent 
attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older. It is administered 
subcutaneously every two weeks. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
In support of the application the applicant submitted a phase 2 randomised double blind placebo- 
controlled dose finding and proof of concept study (BCX7353-203), a phase 3 randomised double blind 
placebo controlled trial conducted in North American and European populations (BCX7353-302), a 
smaller phase 3 study with the same design conducted in a Japanese population (BCX7353-301) and 
an open label uncontrolled phase 2 study (BCX7353-204). 
Study BCX7353-302 is the main clinical study and compared two doses of berotralstat 110mg (n = 41) 
and 150mg (n = 40) versus placebo (n = 40) in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE. Efficacy was 
assessed following 24 weeks of treatment (Part 1). The study is ongoing (Part 2 and 3).
The patient population were required to have a diagnosis of either Type 1 or Type 2 HAE.  Adolescents 
were eligible to participate in both Study BCX7353-302 and 301 studies. However, only 6 adolescent 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 160/168
patients (2 per study arm) were recruited to Study BCX7353-302. Study BCX7353-203 subjects were 
required to have had a documented attack rate of at least 2 HAE attacks per month for 3 consecutive 
months within 6 months prior to screening. Whereas for Studies BCX7353-302 and 301 subjects were 
required to have had ≥ 2 HAE attacks during a 56-day run-in period.
Among berotralstat-treated subjects in the integrated Phase 2/3 prophylactic long-term studies, 16 of 
342 subjects (4.7%) were adolescents, 312 of 342 subjects were adults (91.2%), and 14 of 342 
subjects (4.1%) were elderly subjects. There were no adolescent patients enrolled into the phase 1 
studies.
For both phase 3 studies the primary endpoint was the rate of confirmed HAE attacks during the entire 
24-week dosing period of Part 1 evaluated in the ITT population, defined as the total number of 
investigator-confirmed HAE attacks experienced in the period between first date/time of study drug in 
Part 1 and the first dose date/time in Part 2. Statistical analysis was based on a negative binomial 
regression model. Data on symptoms was recorded by the patient in an electronic diary to which the 
investigators had real time access. 
3.2.  Favourable effects
The pivotal study BCX7353-302 met its primary endpoint reduction in HAE attack rate for both 
berotralstat doses with a greater rate reduction (%) from placebo for berotralstat 150mg (-44.2% with 
95% CI from -59.5 to -23%, p-value < 0.001) compared to berotralstat 110mg (-30% with 95% CI 
from -48.7, -4.6%, p-value 0.024). Investigator attack rates over the dosing period were 1.65/28 days 
for berotralstat 110mg, from a baseline of 2.97/28 days; 1.31/28 days for berotralstat 150mg from a 
baseline of 3.06/28 days; and 2.35/28 days for placebo, from a baseline of 2.91/28 days. 
In this study, the number of days with angioedema symptoms over the 24 weeks was similar for both 
active treatment arms (19 and 20 days) and lower than placebo (29 days). 
Similar results were reported in a supportive Study BCX7353-301 which demonstrated a decrease in 
the rate of angioedema events by 25% (p = 0.181) and 49% (p = 0.003), for 110 and 150 mg 
berotralstat doses compared with placebo respectively. The negative binomial analysis estimated event 
rates per 28 days were 1.64 for berotralstat 110 mg subjects, 1.11 for berotralstat 150 mg subjects, 
and 2.18 for placebo subjects over the 24-week Part 1 dosing period.
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
A missing data sensitivity analysis conducted on the primary endpoint in which observed data post 
study drug discontinuation was used in combination with imputed data for subjects who discontinued 
study treatment prior to the end of Part 1 and did not continue to record HAE attacks showed a 
marked attenuation in the effect size for berotralstat 150mg but not for berotralstat 110mg with a rate 
reduction % from placebo of -35% (95% CI -9.2, -52.9%) as compared to -44.2% in the original 
analysis.  Additional sensitivity analyses provided at the request of the CHMP demonstrated a lesser 
attenuation of effect for the 150 mg dose from 44.2% to 39% (using all observed data and imputing 
remaining missing data under a Jump to Reference assumption) and from 44.2% to 40% (imputing all 
data post-discontinuation of study drug under a Jump to Reference assumption). These data provided 
further reassurance to reduce the uncertainty around the effect size for the berotralstat 150mg dose.
The clinical relevance of the effect size seen in the primary endpoint is considered modest. An 
improvement in the Angioedema Quality of Life Scale (used as key secondary endpoint) was observed 
but without statistically significant difference between the groups. 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 161/168
A pre-planned subgroup analysis in Study 302 showed a greater rate reduction (%) from placebo in 
males in both berotralstat treatment arms compared to females. Additional analyses suggested also 
that the magnitude of the treatment effect on HAE attack rate could be smaller in females than males. 
Additionally, there was an imbalance in the proportion of females across treatment arms (73.2% in the 
berotralstat 110mg arm, 57.5% in the berotralstat 150mg arm and 66% in the placebo arm). Given 
the greater response seen for males, it is possible that the higher rate reduction from placebo seen in 
berotralstat 150mg may have been driven by the larger proportion of males in that treatment group 
(42.5%) compared to that of berotralstat 110mg (26.8%). Additional analyses provided could not fully 
exclude this possibility thus, no definite conclusion could be drawn on the basis of available data.
There has been limited exposure in the development programme to berotralstat of adolescents, with 
only 4 subjects aged from 12 to 17 and weighting ≥40kg exposed to berotralstat. Sub-group analysis 
by age-group was uninformative. There does not appear to be any difference in efficacy between 
adolescent and adult patients however, the data remain limited.
Maintenance of effect is observed up to 48 weeks, however given the small sample size and possible 
individual subjects’ data influence, the interpretation of durability of response is not straightforward.
Evaluation of efficacy by attack site was an exploratory endpoint only and though numerically there 
was a reduction in attack rate for abdominal, peripheral and laryngeal attacks in the berotralstat 
treatment arms compared to placebo, these were not nominally or statistically significant. Available 
data seem to show that berotralstat 150mg produced a reduction in moderate to severe attacks, a 
reduction in acute attack medication usage and in the rate of laryngeal attacks.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
Berotralstat appears to have an acceptable safety profile. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity, 
and recovery was documented. The overall rates for AEs and SAEs were low and similar across all 
treatment arms.
The main unfavourable effects associated with berotralstat are abdominal pain, diarrhoea and 
headache with a frequency very common. Gastroesophageal reflux, Flatulence vomiting are also 
reported as common GI effects. These reactions were generally mild rarely led to treatment 
interruptions.
Drug rash can occur with treatment with a frequency estimated as common.
The most common clinically significant chemistry abnormalities were liver-related abnormalities, (ALT 
and AST increased). The majority of treatment-emergent liver abnormalities were Grade 1 or Grade 2; 
however, some patients experienced more marked elevations with treatment-emergent Grade 4 ALT 
with Grade 3 AST. It acknowledged that these patients remained asymptomatic and that there have 
not been instances of transaminase elevations with concomitant evidence of jaundice or synthetic 
dysfunction to date.  In studies 204 and 302, the incidence of ALT > 3 × ULN was significantly 
correlated with prior androgen duration of ≥ 5 years (p <0.001) and recent discontinuation of 
androgens (p <0.001). The odds of having an elevation were 10.7 × higher for those with ≥ 5 years of 
exposure (14 of 151 subjects [9.3%]) compared to those with < 5 years duration of exposure (2 of 
230 subjects [0.9%]). The odds of having an elevation were 66.0 × higher for those with recent 
androgen use, defined as discontinuation of androgens within 30 days of commencing berotralstat, (14 
of 49 subjects [28.6%]) compared to those without recent androgen use (2 of 332 subjects [0.6%]).
The adolescent group had the lowest proportion of subjects with reported TEAEs, 13 of 16 subjects 
(81.3%), vs. 283 of 312 adult subjects (90.7%), and 13 of 14 elderly subjects (92.9%). The elderly 
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021 
Page 162/168
group had the highest incidence of Grade 3 or Grade 4 TEAEs; 3 of 14 elderly subjects (21.4%), vs. 40 
of 312 adult subjects (12.8%), and 2 of 16 adolescent subjects (12.5%).
The elderly were the highest proportion of subjects who discontinued study drug due to a TEAE and 
also had a higher incidence of potentially drug-related hepatic disorders, GI abdominal TEAS, and had 
a higher incidence of GRADE 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities compared to adolescents and 
adults.
While the lowest number of adverse events was observed in adolescent population, there remain 
uncertainty in the safety profile as the number of adolescent patients was very low. There is 
insufficient data to conclude on the safety in adolescent patients < 40kg. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects.
There are a number of uncertainties in relation to the unfavourable effects observed with berotralstat 
treatment. The limited safety data set for berotralstat means rare events may not have been identified 
in the trials and are therefore remains unknown at this time. 
Long term prior androgen use of ≥ 5 years and discontinuation of androgens within 2 weeks of 
berotralstat initiation were correlated with a higher subject incidence of liver-related TEAEs, but not 
other types of TEAEs. 
Increases of liver enzymes were noted and while there were no incidences of Hy’s law cases, some 
marked elevations in ALT were observed with concomitant elevations in AST. The potential for more 
serious hepatotoxicity cannot be ruled out in larger populations.
In the exposure-response analysis, a statistically significant positive relationship between ΔΔQTcF and 
berotralstat concentration has been observed. In addition, there is an up to 2-fold increase in the 
unbound fraction in moderate and severe hepatic impairment, which coupled with reduced clearance, 
may lead to increased, unbound (pharmacologically active) berotralstat concentrations. Further, the 
highest exposure estimate does not account for coadministration with metabolic or transporter 
inhibitors, nor does it account for the increased exposure in adolescents and low body weight subjects. 
These issues are of particular importance and Appropriate wording to the SmPC has been added to 
address recommendations regarding the need for appropriate monitoring in patient with renal 
impairment and the recommendation to avoid the use in case of moderate to severe haptic 
impairment.
The low number of elderly patients exposed is considered as another limitation of the safety data, 
considering elderly patients experienced the highest level of adverse events and there is uncertainty in 
relation to the safety profile in elderly patients. 
To further characterise use in adolescent patients, a Post authorisation non interventional Safety Study 
(NI PAS; Study 401) has been agreed to further investigate the safety of berotralstat. The applicant 
will collect further information to evaluate long term safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of 
berotralstat in the real-world setting, including growth and development in adolescents.  
Finally, the safety risk associated with phospholipidosis observed in preclinical studies, is incompletely 
investigated and insufficiently understood. Although it is acknowledged that no vital sign 
changes/ADRs/safety labs related to target organs were identified in clinical studies, changes were not 
expected in early phases of phospholipidosis. End-organ damage due to phospholipidosis may correlate 
with the total cumulative dose, as is the case with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Since berotralstat is 
intended as life-long treatment, the true potential of phospholipidosis in humans remains unknown. 
Section 5.3 of the SmPC has been amended to highlight this finding from the preclinical studies.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
Both the main study BCX7353 302 and the supportive study (study 301) with same design in a smaller 
population conducted in Japan met the primary endpoint for the berotralstat 150mg dose. However,

the clinical relevance of the effect size is modest given the lack of impact on quality of life measures. 
There is also a suspicion that the greater effect size seen for berotralstat 150mg compared to the 
110mg dose may be driven by an imbalance of males/females across the treatment arms. 
The studied population consisted of type 1 and type 2 patients only. Considering available scientific 
knowledge, it was considered acceptable to extrapolate efficacy to other types and grant a broader 
indication as initially proposed by the applicant.
There is very limited data in adolescents and there does not appear to be any difference in efficacy 
between adolescent and adult patients. There were no data in adolescents less than 40 kg, therefore 
there is no recommendation for use in this population.
From a safety perspective, berotralstat appears to have an acceptable safety profile. Most AEs were 
mild to moderate in severity, and recovery was documented. The overall rates for AEs and SAEs were 
low and similar across all treatment arms. The commonest adverse reactions were headache, GI 
adverse events such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, GI reflux and vomiting and liver dysfunction. The 
concerns regarding risk of QTc prolongation, have been addressed in the SmPC with appropriate 
warning to clarify this to prescribers.
Hepatotoxicity has been identified as a potential risk in the summary of safety concerns in the RMP.
Cardiac effects were identified as a safety concern from nonclinical studies. While abnormalities in ECG 
morphology reported were of borderline clinical significance it is noted that in the exposure-response 
analysis, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between ΔΔQTcF and berotralstat 
concentration. 
The elderly population appeared to have a worse safety profile perhaps due to underlying concomitant 
disease. No firm conclusion can be drawn. The safety profile in adolescents, although limited in terms 
of patient numbers to be conclusive, does not appear to highlight any different safety profile provided 
use is restricted to adolescent patients weighing 40 kg or more. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
Both the main study BCX7353 302 and a study with same design in a smaller population conducted in 
Japan met the primary endpoint for the berotralstat 150mg dose. However, the clinical relevance of 
the effect size is modest given the uncertainties of impact on quality of life measures. Further positive 
data has been provided which demonstrates efficacy in the reduction of moderate to severe attacks 
and laryngeal attacks which can be life threatening. Overall, it can be concluded that efficacy has been 
demonstrated in adults and adolescent patients weighing 40 kg or more for the berotralstat 150mg 
dose strength.
The safety profile appears to indicate that berotralstat is a safe and well-tolerated treatment for HAE 
patients. The most common adverse events associated with treatment are mostly GI disturbances such 
as abdominal pain, vomiting nausea and diarrhoea as well as transaminase elevations, headache and 
rash. Hepatotoxicity has been identified as a potential risk in the summary of safety concerns in the 
RMP. 
Warnings related to cardiac effects and risk of prolonged QT associated with increased serum 
berotralstat concentrations have been introduced in the SmPC for patients with moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment and in patients with severe renal impairment. In these patients the use of 
berotralstat in these patients should be avoided.  If treatment is required, appropriate monitoring (e.g. 
ECGs) should be considered.
Assessment report 
EMA/153239/2021

There are no data available for the use of berotralstat in patients with independent risk factors for QT 
prolongation such as electrolyte disturbances, known pre-existing QT prolongation (either acquired or 
familial), advancing age (see section 4.2), or concomitant use of other medicinal products known to 
prolong the QT. It is preferable to avoid the use of berotralstat in these patients. If treatment is 
required, appropriate monitoring (e.g. ECGs) should be considered.
While an oral medication is welcomed, there is an increased rate of GI events, headache, liver 
dysfunction and concerns in tolerability for elderly patients. 
There is limited data in the adolescent and the elderly population, with lack of information for older age 
groups (75 years and older). The applicant agreed to commit to a non-interventional post-
authorization study (NI PAS; Study 401). With this NI PAS, the applicant plans to collect further 
information to evaluate long term safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of berotralstat in the real-world 
setting, including growth and development in adolescents.
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall B/R of Orladeyo is positive.
4.  Recommendations
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products
The CHMP 
 is of the opinion that berotralstat is not similar to Takhzyro within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.
Outcome
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Orladeyo is favourable in the following indication:
Orladeyo is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in 
adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older.
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

medicinal product
Risk Management Plan (RMP)
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP.
An updated RMP should be submitted:

At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
 Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States
Not applicable.
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC. 
New Active Substance Status
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that berotralstat is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

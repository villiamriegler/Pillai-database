1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Novartis Europharm Limited submitted on 2 November 2017 a group of variation(s) consisting of an 
extension of the marketing authorisation and the following variation(s): 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
The MAH applied for an extension application to introduce a new strength of hard capsules (0.25 mg) to the 
currently approved presentations of Gilenya, grouped with a type II variation (extension of indication) to add 
a new indication for the treatment of paediatric patients of 10 years of age and above with relapsing multiple 
sclerosis (RMS).  As a consequence, sections 1, 2, 3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6 and 8 of the SmPC 
are updated. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance. In addition, Annex II is updated 
to be brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0050/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0050/2017 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0050/2017. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication. 
Additional marketing protection 
The MAH requested consideration of one year marketing protection in regards of its application for a new 
indication in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004. The CHMP reviewed the data 
submitted by the marketing authorisation holder, taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings significant clinical

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous 
system (CNS), characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and axonal/neuronal destruction ultimately 
leading to severe disability. Although MS generally affects young adults (average age of onset is 29 years), it 
can present in childhood and adolescence. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
In childhood and adolescence, the disease will manifest in around 5% (from 2 to 10%) of MS cases, with less 
than 1-2% occurring in children before the age of 10-12 years (Waldman et al 2016). Hence, the overall 
prevalence estimates for paediatric MS are low, ranging from 0.07 to 2.9 per 100,000 (Gadoth 2003, Pohl et 
al 2007, Renoux et al 2007, Chitnis et al 2009, Waldman et al 2016). 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
As in adults, a diagnosis of MS in paediatric patients is made based on clinical and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) features. According to the consensus definition proposed by the International Paediatric MS 
Study Group, a diagnosis of MS in paediatric patients requires multiple episodes of CNS demyelination 
separated in time and space (Krupp et al 2013), but these events must not meet acute disseminated 
encephalomyelitis (ADEM) criteria. Symptomatic overlap with ADEM and the increased chance of 
leukodystrophies and metabolic disorders, complicates the differential diagnosis of paediatric-onset MS 
relative to adult onset MS (Venkateswaran and Banwell 2010, Krupp et al 2013). 
The initial course of MS is more often relapsing (-remitting) in paediatric onset MS (>98%) than in adult 
onset (approximately 85%) (Waldman et al 2016). The relapse rate in paediatric MS is reported to be 2-3 
times higher than in adult onset MS (Weinshenker et al 1989a, Weinshenker et al 1989b, Trojano et al 2002, 
Yeh et al 2009, Benson et al 2014, Waldman et al 2016). Although MRI features in paediatric MS are less well 
described, available data show that the underlying pathology is similar to adult relapsing MS. Children, 
however, tend to have a higher number of T2 lesions at the time of first event than adults (Waubant et al 
2009) and a lower propensity for lesions to enhance with gadolinium (Gd) (Banwell et al 2007). A consistent 
finding in most of the paediatric cohort studies is lower disability scores in paediatric MS compared to adult 
MS, even when disease duration is taken into account. In the paediatric cohort described by (Renoux et al 
2007), the estimated median times from onset to the assignment of Disability Status Scale (DSS) scores of 
4, 6 and 7 were 20 years, 29 years and 37 years, respectively. Compared to the adult-onset population, the 
time to DSS scores of 4, 6 and 7 were approximately 10 years longer for patients with childhood onset MS. 
Similarly, and in line with this slower progression of disability, the conversion to secondary progressive MS 
(SPMS) took approximately 10 years longer in paediatric MS than in adult patients, occurring at a median of 
28.1 years after the first attack of paediatric MS compared to 18.8 years for adult-onset patients. The median 
age of the person at SPMS onset was 41 years in paediatric patients with MS vs 52 years in adult MS (~10 
years earlier in paediatric patients vs adult MS).

Page 8/61 
  
  
2.1.4.  Management 
Similarly to adults, treatment strategies in paediatric MS are focused on treatment of acute relapse, MS 
symptoms, and disease-modification. Despite limited published data suggesting that the efficacy and safety 
profile in adolescents (≥12 years of age) is similar to that seen in adults, 3 IFN β agents (2 IFN β-1a and 1 
IFN β-1b) and glatiramer acetate are allowed to be used in paediatric patients with MS according to the 
dosage and administration sections of the EU summary of product characteristics (SmPC). 
About the product 
Fingolimod was first registered in Russia on 17-Aug-2010 under the brand name Gilenya. Since then, Gilenya 
was registered on 21-Sep-2010 in the US, on 17-Mar-2011 in the EU and now in more than 85 countries 
worldwide for adult patients with relapsing MS. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The aim of this type II variation is to extend the indication to the paediatric population (10 to 18 years).  
The Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for fingolimod (Gilenya®) was first approved by the EMA on 05-Dec-
2008 (EMEA-000087-PIP01-07; EMA decision P/125/2008) for the Condition: “Multiple Sclerosis”; 
pharmaceutical form: hard capsule. The PIP has been modified in agreement with the Paediatric Committee 
(PDCO): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
on 27 September 2011, decision # P/223/2011, 
on 21 November 2012, decision # P/0272/2012,  
on 26 April 2013, decision # P/0117/2013,  
on 9 September 2016, decision # P/0230/2016, 
on 3 April 2017, final agreed on PIP version (EMEA-000087-PIP01-07-M05), decision # P/0050/2017.  
In the original PIP, an open label, randomized, active controlled (IFN β-1a) study (Study D2311) in paediatric 
MS patients at the age of 10 to <18 years was planned. Modifications to the study design to incorporate a 
double dummy, double blind scheme were implemented to meet the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) 
Written Request (EMA decision P/272/2012). Other modifications were also implemented during this PIP 
decision in order to: 
-  Replace an initially planned lead-in PK study by a run-in PK study: Considering the limited number of 
paediatric  MS  patients  available  to  enroll  in  the  clinical  trial,  Novartis  proposed  not  to  conduct  a  PK 
lead-in study but to enroll all patients in the core efficacy and safety study which will include on-line 
PK assessment of adequacy of exposure at the starting dose in the patients with a body weight of 40 
kg or less.  
- 
- 
Implement  a  clinical  primary  endpoint  (annualized  relapse  rate,  ARR)  instead  of  one  based  on  MRI. 
This change was made to take into account the specific requests from FDA. 
Enlarge the number of study participants by paediatric subset: 95 patients by treatment arm, instead 
of the initially planned 45 patients by treatment arm. 
-  Consider  dose  adjustment  for  children  weighting less  than  40  kg.  In  these  children,  initial  dose was 
halved (0.25 mg/d) and adjusted following the collection of blood samples at month 1 (predose and 
at approx. 6 hours post-dose, close to fingolimod-P peak concentration time), the on-line analysis of 
concentrations allowing to increase the dose if patients are below the target exposure.  
In 2016, the Novartis proposed the following changes to the study: 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 9/61 
  
  
-  Switching from a fixed duration study design (2 years treatment) to a flexible duration design (up to 
2  years),  leading  to  a  reduction  of  the  time  of  participation  for  some  patients  in  the  trial,  but 
maintaining the required power of 80% to detect a 50% relative treatment effect on the annualized 
relapse rate. Indeed, Novartis proposed to add a blinded sample size re-estimation (BSSR) in the first 
half  of  2017.  If  the  results  of  this  repeated  BSSR  would  indicate  that  the  amount  of  information 
maintained  the  same  80%  power  needed  for  the  primary  analysis  (based  on  the  relapse  activity  of 
the  recruited  patient  population  and  the  observed  dispersion  parameter),  then  the  study  could  be 
stopped earlier.  
- 
Pre-pubertal population requirement changed from 20% to approximately 10% of patients ~12 years 
old,  due  to  advanced  puberty  status  in  patients  with  MS  and  thus  a  low  availability  of  pre-pubertal 
patients. 
-  A  modeling  approach  using  a  negative  binomial  model  adjusted  by  treatment,  age,  pubertal  status, 
treatment-age  interaction,  and  treatment-pubertal  status  interaction,  to  evaluate  the  effect  of 
pubertal status on efficacy and to extrapolate efficacy for the very young patients (≤12 years of age). 
An Opinion was adopted by the PDCO on 27 January 2017. On 8 March 2017 Novartis submitted to the EMA a 
written request including detailed grounds for a re-examination of the Opinion. After re-examination of the 
additional analysis provided by the MAH, and after an extensive discussion the PDCO agreed on the proposed 
changes to the study design (on 3 April 2017). 
On 10 November 2017, the PDCO adopted an opinion confirming the compliance of all studies in the agreed 
PIP as set out in the latest Agency's Decision (P/0050/2017) of 3 April 2017. 
To be noted, the MAH requested also a scientific advice (SA) from the SWAP on 24 August 2016 regarding 
issues also discussed during the last request form PIP amendment. This SA was given on 13 October 2016. 
Its discussion and conclusions have been taken into account through the last validated PIP. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The new strength of finished product is presented as hard capsules containing fingolimod hydrochloride, 
equivalent to 0.25 mg fingolimod, as active substance. 
Other ingredients are:  
Capsule fill: mannitol, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylbetadex and magnesium stearate 
Capsule shell: gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171) and yellow iron oxide (E172) 
Printing ink: Shellac glaze, iron oxide black (E172), propylene glycol and ammonium hydroxide 
The product is available in PVC/PVDC/aluminium blister packs and unit dose blister packs as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Gilenya 0.25 mg hard capsules contain the same active substance, fingolimod hydrochloride, as that used to 
manufacture the already authorised 0.5 mg hard capsules. The active substance is sourced from the same 
manufacturer, manufactured with the same process and released in accordance with the same active 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 10/61 
  
  
substance specifications. Therefore, the applicant presented no new information in the dossier to support this 
line extension application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  an  immediate  release  hard  capsule  for  oral  administration.  The  capsule  is  an  ivory, 
opaque,  size  3  (16  mm)  capsule,  with  “FTY  0.25mg”  radially  imprinted  in  black  ink  on  the  cap  and  a  black 
radial band on the body. The capsule contains a white to almost white powder. 
The aim was to develop a lower dose (0.25 mg) fingolimod capsule as compared to the marketed 0.5 mg 
capsule, suitable for paediatric patients. The quality target product profile (QTPP) is defined as an immediate 
release orally available dosage form containing 0.25 mg of fingolimod, suitable for paediatric patients from 
10 years old upwards and weighing less than 40 kg, packed in a container closure system offering the 
required protective properties supporting the proposed shelf-life, and labelled according to local 
requirements. 
The active substance is soluble at pH 1, very slightly soluble at pH 4, and practically insoluble from pH 5-8 
and is considered to be BCS class II. Therefore, the same grade of active substance is used as in the 0.5 mg 
capsules. The grades and quantities of the different excipients were optimised during further development 
studies. The final formulation was shown to be bioequivalent to the 0.5 mg capsules, despite the different 
formulation and excipients, in a bioavailability study. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients 
and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of 
this report. 
Optimisation of the manufacturing process had to take into account the reactivity of the active substance, as 
well as its low content in the final formulation. 
It is recommended that capsules are taken intact since the active substance is considered as 
pharmacologically highly active, exposure to caregivers should be avoided and dose accuracy cannot be 
assured if the capsules are opened. Therefore the statement “The capsules should always be swallowed 
intact, without opening them” is added in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The dissolution method is the same as used for the marketed 0.5 mg capsules. Due to the properties of the 
active substance, it wasn’t possible to demonstrate the discriminatory power vis-à-vis meaningful changes in 
active substance attributes and process parameters. However, since the rate-limiting factor in terms of drug 
release was shown to be capsule rupture rather than granulate dissolution, and capsule rupture is monitored 
during manufacture with an in-process control (IPC) for disintegration, the dissolution method is considered 
to be adequate. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PVDC/aluminium blisters. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 11/61 
  
  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 13 main steps The major steps are preparation of the active substance 
and  excipients  solution,  spray  granulation,  blending  with  extra-granular  excipients,  and  capsule  filling.  The 
process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
Critical steps were defined. For each of these steps, critical process parameters were identified and suitable 
set-points  or  ranges  have  been  defined.  The  in-process  controls  re  considered  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
The  process  has  been  validated on  3  production  scale  batches  of  capsules.  Process  parameters  were  varied 
within the proposed ranges for the critical steps and no impact on finished product quality was observed. All 
3  batches  complied  with  the  release  specifications.  The  applicant  will  manufacture  a  further  3  production 
scale batches at the target set-points. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  process  is  considered 
validated. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance of contents and shell (visual examination), mean mass of contents, identity (UV, HPLC), water 
content (Karl Fischer – coulometric or titrimetric), degradation products (HPLC), assay (HPLC), dissolution 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.) and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
The impurities have been qualified at levels much higher than those specified. A risk assessment for 
elemental impurities was carried out in line with ICH Q3D, considering all potential sources including raw 
materials, equipment, and packaging. No elemental impurities were detected above 30% of the respective 
PDEs in batches tested and so no control of elemental impurities is deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  3  production  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  12  months  under  long  term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH), and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
capsules were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance of capsule shell and contents, assay, degradation products, dissolution, 
water  content  and  microbial  enumeration.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are stability indicating.  Results  at 
later  time-points  were  generally  within  specification  for  all  tested  parameters.  Analogous  results  were

observed under intermediate conditions. Under accelerated conditions, assay had decreased by 5% compared 
to the initial time-point. 
Samples were also analyzed after storage at 5 oC, -20 oC, in an open dish under long term and intermediate 
conditions, and after multiple freeze/thaw cycles. The results indicate that there should be no restrictions as 
regards freezing or refrigerating, and that capsules may be used for up to 3 months following removal from 
the original PVC/PVDC blisters. 
In  addition,  1  batch  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability  Testing  of  New 
Drug Substances and Products. The results show that the finished product is not photosensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 18 months stored not above 25 oC as stated in the 
SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEPs from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture were provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. Although a different formulation from the 
marketed 0.5 mg capsules is used, the two formulations were shown to be bioequivalent. Compliance with 
the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) was demonstrated and the formulation is deemed to be suitable for the 
target age range. The capsules are to be taken whole, in line with the instructions in the SmPC. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
The purpose of this application is to add a new indication for the treatment of paediatric patients of 10 years 
of age and above with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) and also a line extension (new dose strength of 
0.25mg).  No new study was submitted for the extension of indication; however two juvenile toxicity studies

in rats were previously submitted. The targeted population, children from 10 years to less than 18 years of 
age, is covered by these studies. 
In both juvenile toxicity studies, fingolimod induce expected pharmacological effect on hematological cells 
and lymphoid organs at all tested doses. It also affected body weight and food intake. No significant adverse 
effect on behavioural tests or sexual development parameters were reported,  however a clear impact on 
growth as evidenced by reduced bone (femur) length was reported in the second juvenile toxicity. Given the 
targeted population of adolescent having a rapid growth and where maturation of skeletal system will 
continue into adulthood, the impact of fingolimod on growth, bone architecture, and bone strength should be 
addressed. The proposed post-authorization study collecting  long term safety data, in addition to the 
proposed long term extension of D2311 study, especially in the subpopulation (patients aged ≤ 12 years, 
≤ 40 kg or Tanner Stage <2 (pre-pubertal) group, would provide crucial data in this aspect. 
The applicant provided some additional in vitro and in vivo studies on S1P4 receptor to explore his role on the 
effect of FTY720 on the immune system. It was concluded that S1P4 could partially contribute to the effect 
but was not the main receptor responsible of the lymphoid depletion. Mechanism of action of bradycardia and 
vasoconstriction were also studied in vitro in guinea pigs and isolated rabbit aorta and coronary artery. It was 
concluded that bradycardia could be mediated primarily by IK(ACh)/GIRK activation and that vasoconstriction 
seems to be mediated by a Rho kinase and calcium dependant mechanism. 
Fingolimod is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.4.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Fingolimod (FTY720) is already commercialized and currently available as a 0.5 mg hard capsule. The 
pharmacokinetics of FTY720 has been well characterized in MS adult patients. It was described in detail in the 
previously submitted global dossiers and included in the approved labels. 
The current Type II variation of extension of the indication of FTY720 in the paediatric population (10 to < 18 
years)  have  been  addressed  according  to  the  paediatric  investigation  part  of  FTY720  clinical  development. 
Novartis  conducted  a  Study  D2311  (Pivotal  Study)  in  paediatric  patients  aged  10  to  <  18  years  old  with 
multiple  sclerosis  (MS).  According  to  the  proposed  doses  selected,  a  lower  dose  formulation  (0.25  mg  hard 
gelatin capsule) was developed specifically for the paediatric patients enrolled with a body weight of 40 kg or 
less.  
To note, a preliminary PK  assessment in 7 stable paediatric renal patients on Neoral® (cyclosporine) based 
immunosuppression  aged  11  to  16  years,  dosed  at  0.07  mg/kg,    have  been  conducted  (Study  A0115)  and 
was join to the dossier. 
Study  D2311  was  a  two  year,  double-blind,  randomized,  multicenter,  active  controlled  Core  Phase  study  to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of fingolimod administered orally once daily versus interferon β-1a i.m. once 
weekly  in  paediatric  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  with  five-year  fingolimod extension  phase.  215 patients 
were enrolled, 107 were treated with fingolimod.  
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 14/61 
  
  
Only one relevant biopharmaceutic study (Study D2117) for the current submission have been conducted to 
compare  the  new  fingolimod  formulation  (0.25  mg)  to  the  FMI  of  0.5  mg,  since  the  paediatric  study  have 
been conducted with both strength. Study Results were conclusive, the two formulations are bioequivalent. 
Two bionanalytical methods for the simultaneous quantification of FTY720 and its active metabolite 
fingolimod-P (FTY720-P) have been developed at two different sites for Study D2311 earlier samples 
(Novartis Contract Research Organization) Wuxi Apptec (China), and later samples at SGS Cephac Europe 
(France), a second bioanalytical laboratory (Novartis Contract Research Organization). 
Generally, based on the validation report, the used bioanalytical methods developed at the two different sites 
appear adequate and comply with acceptance criteria regarding selectivity, sensitivity accuracy and precision. 
Analytical validation reports were provided with satisfactory results. Short and long-term stability of the 
analytes in biological matrix were tested and shown to be satisfactory. ISR were performed with satisfactory 
results.  
As  no  cross-validation  studies  have  been  performed  to  confirm  that  these  two  methods  produce  equivalent 
quantification  of  FTY720-P  in  whole  blood  in  the  same  sample,  the  applicant  proposed  an  ISR  on  n=38 
samples to provide evidence that the two developed methods (at two different sites) for the quantification of 
fingolimod-P were similar. The CHMP concluded that the cross check between the two analytical sites met the 
predefined acceptance criteria. 
For the extension of the indication of FTY720 in the paediatric population, four PK and PKPD analysis were 
provided, a population PK analysis to describe FTY720-P steady-state concentration in paediatric, and three 
population PK/PD analysis with pooled PD data from adults and paediatrics to link steady-state concentrations 
of FTY720-P effects on Lymphocyte count, annualized remitting relapse (ARR) and new and newly enlarging 
T2 lesions (T2), decrease. Nonmem® and SAS® software were used for PK and PD parameters estimation. 
• 
Population PK analysis of FTY720-P in paediatrics 
The main applicant assumption was that the current approved strength of 0.5 mg in adults would produce 
similar exposure at the same dosage in paediatrics weighting more than 40 kg, and also the new strength of 
0.25 mg for paediatric patients weighting less than 40 kg.  
According to applicant the objectives of this analysis were:  
- 
to  assess  by  graphical  exploration  if  the  steady-state  FTY720-P  concentrations  in  MS  paediatric 
patients aged 10 years old to <18 years old achieve the desired adult target FTY720-P stead:-state 
concentration  level  (1.353  ng/mL,  (90%  CI:  0.62-3.1  ng/mL)  defined  with  pooled  PK  data  from 
Studies D2301 and D2302 (Pivotal Phase III studies from the initial MAA) 
- 
To develop a linear mixed effects PK model to describe the FTY720-P concentrations at steady-state 
in the MS paediatric population using data from Study D2311 
A sparse PK sampling protocol have been performed in paediatrics, from which only samples which have 
reach steady-state were included in the Population PK analysis, this is supported since in adults it have been 
demonstrated that exposure levels were the best predictor of efficacy (ARR). Therefore only 544 steady-state 
concentrations of FTY720-P from n=103 patients were available.  
Dosing regimen consisted of 0.25 mg OD for patients with weighting less than 40 kg and 0.5 mg OD above 
40 kg. The dosing regimen rationale with a 40 kg cut-off have been identified by simulation using two 
independent datasets, PK data from Study A0115 (preliminary PK assessment in paediatrics and PK data 
from two Phase II and III in adult MS patient). According to the applicant, this analysis indicated that an 
allometric scaling method based on normalized body weight with an exponent of 0.53 was adequate to 
describe the relationship between body weight and elimination clearance.  
Overall, 9 Patients with weight < 40 kg have received 0.25 mg OD and were monitoring at Visit 5 (Month 1). 
From the observed concentrations at predose and 6h post dose, Cav,ss of FTY720-P have been estimated and 
compared to the 65% lower bound (0.9 ng/mL) of the adult target concentration (1.353 ng/mL). 6 of 9 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 15/61 
  
  
patients had their Cav,ss above 0.9 ng/mL. For those who have not reach the targeted concentration it was 
proposed to increase the dose at 0.5 mg OD.  
An exploratory graphical analysis was performed to assess the overlap between FTY720-P steady-state 
concentrations observed in paediatrics and the targeted steady state concentration levels of FTY720-P in 
adults. This analysis show that FTY720-P steady-state concentration in paediatrics are 23% lower (median 
1.1 ng/mL in paediatrics vs 1.35 ng/mL in adults) than in adults. 
A Population PK analysis have been performed to characterize steady-state concentrations of FTY720-P in 
paediatrics. This PK model is of particular of interest, since the predicted steady-state concentration of 
FTY720-P would be used as an input in three developed PK/PD model. A linear mixed effect model have been 
developed on log transformed steady-state concentrations of FTY720-P. The developed structural model is 
supported given the sparse sampling protocol which does not allow to estimate with a good precision FTY720-
P PK parameters (such as Clearance, distribution volume…) from a two compartment model (Previous 
studies). Covariates search is well documented, dose and baseline body weight (centered to 70 kg) effects on 
intercept have been maintained in the final model. To note baseline body weight effect was not statistically 
significant according to the covariates screening procedure but was maintained in the final model.  
Fixed effects parameter estimates were estimated with a poor precision and particularly the intercept 
parameter (with a RSE of 235%) which is the most important parameter (Log-transformed PK data, 
exp(intercept)=steady-state concentration in the original scale) of the linear model. Diagnostic plots have not 
shown any misspecification, except the NPD QQ plot from which distribution is not clearly around the identity 
line. Therefore the NPDE computation and the dedicated statistical work to test the validity of the normality 
assumption is needed (See PK OC3b). Predictive performance of the Final PK model was evaluated using a 
pcVPC. This graph shows a tendency to over predict the higher range of observed concentrations in 
paediatrics. Indeed, the 95th percentile of observed data is on the extreme lower limit of the 90%CI of the 
95th percentile. Finally a simulation analysis based on the developed PK model was provided to explore the 
impact of baseline body weight (20 to 80 kg) and dose (0.25 or 0.5 mg OD) on the predicted steady-state 
concentration of FTY720-P. This analysis confirm the expected nonlinear relationship (see dosing rationale) 
between weight and steady-state concentration with nonlinear decreased of steady-state concentration with 
increasing weight. 
Population PKPD analyses 
Three PK/PD analyses were performed by the applicant and presented below. Main applicant assumption was 
that the current approved strength of 0.5 mg in adults would produce similar exposure-response (PK/PD) 
relationship at the same dosage in paediatrics weighting more than 40 kg, and also for the new strength of 
0.25 mg in MS children < 40 kg.  
The applicant modelling strategy for all these analyses was to use the previous developed PKPD model in 
adults and check its predictive performance on paediatric PD data. If the results were not conclusive, this 
implies that the response was different between adult and paediatrics. Then the PKPD model was updated 
using pooled PD data from adults and paediatrics, and to account for difference between the two populations, 
binary paediatric covariates effects were introduced in the PD parameters of interest. 
The three chosen PD/clinical efficacy endpoints (lymphocyte counts, ARR and T2) have been already used 
and validated in the initial dossier. PK and PD data from adults MS came from Studies D2301 and D2302 
(Pivotal studies from the MAA). 
This strategy could not be considered as optimal because a formal PKPD model with only PK and PD data in 
the paediatric population would have been more relevant. However, taken into account, the scarcity of the 
available paediatric PD data, the applicant strategy could be supported; at the risk to have a POP-PKPD 
estimation parameters driven by adults data.

Population PKPD analysis-Lymphocyte 
A  Population  PKPD  model  have  been  developed  to  describe  the  effect  of  steady-state  concentration  of 
FTY720-P  on  decreased  Lymphocyte  count.  A  nonlinear  mixed  effect  model  have  been  developed  on  log 
transformed  Lymphocyte  count,  with  FTY720-P  steady  state  concentration  as  an  input.  The  link  function

between PK and PD is an Imax model. Predictive performance of the adult PK/PD model have been evaluated 
using a pcVPC. This is supported. 
From the pooled data between adults (Study D2301 and D2302) and paediatrics, a total of 11742 lymphocyte 
count  records  from  1269  adults  in  Study  2301,  845  adults  from  Study  D2302  and  107  paediatric  patients 
were available and included in the final POPPKPD analysis. Out of 2114 patients from adult data, 851 (40%) 
were on 0.5 mg treatment, 846 (40%) were on 1.25 mg treatment and 417 (20%) were on placebo. Out of 
107 paediatric patients, 98 (92%) were on 0.5 mg treatment and only 9 (8%) were on 0.25 mg treatment. 
From  the  data  included  in  the  analysis,  the  median  (range)  baseline  lymphocyte  counts  from  the  Studies 
D2301,  D2302  and  D2311  were  1.77  (0.620-6.23),  1.70  (0.740-4.06)  and  2.00  (0.9004.90)  109/L.  It  is 
therefore expected that lymphocyte count in paediatrics is greater than observed in adults. From the Study 
D2311  data  included  in  the  analysis,  the  overall  median  (range)  baseline  lymphocyte  counts  were  2.00 
(0.900–4.90) 109/L. The median (range) baseline lymphocyte counts corresponding to 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg 
FTY720 treatments were 2.50 (1.504.90) and 2.00 (0.900–4.00) 109/L, respectively. 
Lymphocyte counts for only paediatrics have not been provided. However based on the protocol a maximum 
of 1391 (107 x 13 = 1391) lymphocyte counts are expected. Then, the paediatric lymphocyte data will count 
in the best case for 11.8% (1391/11742*100) of the total pooled dataset. It is therefore expected that the 
results from the Final POPPKPD analysis will be driven by adults (as discussed above). 
The  first  step  on  the  analysis  shows  that  the  previous  developed  PKPD  model  in  adults  provide  under 
prediction of the lymphocyte count than the observed lymphocyte count in paediatrics. Therefore to account 
for  paediatric  effect,  three  covariates  were  introduced  on  Imax,  IC50  and  baseline.  The  second  step  was 
conclusive, this therefore could be expected.  
Parameters of the final PKPD model have been well estimated except for the paediatric covariates effect on 
Imax and IC50, respectively with RSE of 115 and 226% and were considered not statistically different from 
adults  by  the  applicant,  as  they  were  respectively  associated  with  6  and  12%  decrease  in  paediatrics.  The 
maximum reduction in lymphocytes from baseline was estimated 81% in adult patients and 79% in paediatric 
patients,  the  IC50  was  estimated  at  0.327  ng/mL.  Paediatric  covariate  effect  on  baseline  lymphocyte  count 
has  been  well  estimated  and  to  note  is  expected  to  be  maintained  in  the  final  POPPKPD  model  since  at 
baseline lymphocyte count was different between the two populations.  
• 
Population PKPD analysis-Relapse 
An  exposure-response  analysis  have  been  developed  to  describe  the  effect  of  steady-state  concentration  of 
FTY720-P  on  decreased  of  annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR).  Remitting-relapse  have  been  modeled  using  a  2-
state continuous Markov model whereas, decreasing relapse by an Imax function. Predictive performance of 
the adult PK/PD model have been evaluated using a PPC. This is supported. 
The paediatric patients receiving FTY720 0.5 mg have similar relapse values at 1 or 2 year compared to the 
Interferon (INF) treatment group. To note the paediatric patients receiving FTY720 0.25 mg OD have lower 
number of relapse in the  previous 1 or 2 years prior to treatment than that of treated with FTY720 0.5 mg 
QD or INF. The total number of relapse with FTY720 is around 80% lower than that observed with INF (25 vs 
118) with an ARR of 0.141 vs 0.762 respectively. Moreover it seems that as FTY720-P increased (low tertile: 
0.243-0.885,  mid:  0.885-1.292,  high:  1.292-1.963  ng/mL)  the  AAR  decreased  (respectively,  0.215,  0.131, 
0.082). 
The  first  step  on  the  analysis  shows  that  the  previous  developed  PKPD  model  in  adults  provide  over 
prediction  of  the  AAR  than  the  observed  paediatric  data.  Therefore  to  account  for  paediatric  effect,  five 
covariates  were  introduced  and  maintained  in  the  final  PKPD  analysis.  From  these  covariates  only  one 
covariate (paediatric effect on the intercept log transition rates from the relapse to the remitting state) was 
found to be statistically significant.  
• 
Population PKPD analysis-T2 
An exposure-response analysis have been developed to describe the effect of steady-state concentration of 
FTY720-P on decreased of new and newly enlarged T2 lesions. New and newly enlarging T2 lesions have been

modeled using a negative binomial distribution whereas, decreasing T2 lesion by an Imax function. Predictive 
performance of the adult PK/PD model have been evaluated using a PPC. This is supported. 
The paediatric patient receiving FTY720 0.5 mg have similar baseline values, except for the volume of T2 
lesions at baseline which have a higher mean in the INF group. To note the paediatric patient receiving 
FTY720 0.25 mg OD have lower number galodinium enhanced T1 lesions, lower EDSS score and higher 
volume of T2 lesions than that of treated with FTY720 0.5 mg OD or INF. the observed new and newly 
enlarging T2 lesions at 12 months with regards to the binning (3 groups: low, mid, high, see PK/PD model 
evaluation) of the steady-state predicted FTY720-P concentrations. It could be observed that as FTY720-P 
increased (low tertile: 0.243-0.885, mid: 0.885-1.292, high: 1.292-1.963 ng/mL) the new and newly 
enlarging T2 lesions at 12 months decreased (respectively, 4, 3, 2 in median). 
The first step on the analysis shows that the previous developed PKPD model in adults provide under 
prediction of the T2 than the observed paediatric data. Therefore four paediatric effect covariates were 
introduced in the PKPD model and two (covariate effects on baseline and interferon effect on baseline) was 
include in the final model with regards to a covariate screening procedure (backward deletion). The second 
step was fully conclusive. To note the full covariates paediatric effects screening was provided by the 
applicant. The developed PKPD model could be considered endorsed. 
Overall, FTY720-P PK have been well described in the paediatric population. Applicant proposal dose 0.25 mg 
for patients with weight ≤40 kg and 0.5 mg above 40 kg is supported. 
From the four population PK and PKPD analysis, only the results of the exposure-response analysis (new and 
newly enlarged T2 lesions) could be supported.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose-response study  
No dedicated dose response study in this population was conducted by the MAH. However, during the main 
study submitted to support the indication extension, the dose of fingolimod was adjusted with regards to the 
baseline patient weight: 
- 
- 
In patients ≤40 kg, the initial dose was 0.25 mg/d, then after one month of treatment, and based on 
on-line PK assessment, this dose could be increased to 0.5 mg/d.  
In patients >40 kg, the chosen dose was the same as for MS adults patients (0.5 mg/d). 
2.5.2.  Main clinical study (D2311) 
In order to support the extension of indication in paediatric population, the MAH conducted a phase 3, flexible 
duration (up to 2 years), double-blind, double dummy, randomized, multi-center, active controlled study 
evaluating the efficacy/safety of fingolimod once daily (weight-based dosing; 0.25 mg ≤40 kg or 0.5 mg >40 
kg) vs IFN β-1a 30 μg im once/week. This double-blind phase was followed by an open-label extension phase 
of 5 years duration in order to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of fingolimod in this population. The 
Core phase study was stopped by 14-Jul-2017 (last patient received last treatment), the extension phase is 
still on-going at the time of this assessment Report (AR). This study was performed in 87 centres Worldwide 
(from Europe, North and South America, and Russia). 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 18/61 
  
  
* The 3 months follow-up visit was required for those patients who did not continue into the Extension Phase. 
The primary efficacy endpoint chosen was the reducing the frequency of annualized relapse rate (ARR – 
confirmed relapses) after a treatment for up to 24 months. 
The key secondary endpoint used was to compare fingolimod and IFN β-1a groups in reducing the number of 
new/newly enlarging T2 (n/neT2) lesions after a treatment for up to 24 months. 
Other main secondary efficacy endpoints used during this clinical study were: 
-  Other relapse-related parameters: 
o  Time to first relapse 
o  Proportion of patients relapse-free 
-  T1 Gd-enhancing lesions on brain MRI. 
Also, there were exploratory endpoints during Core Phase, including: 
-  Other MRI measures including change in total T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense lesion volumes, new 
T1 hypointense lesion count…. 
-  Efficacy parameters in the subset of pre-pubertal children with MS. 
-  Effects on physical and sexual development. 
-  Effects on measures of cognition and health related quality of life. 
In addition to the above pre-planned analyses, the MAH provided other post-hoc efficacy subgroup analyses 
on primary (confirmed ARR) and key secondary (number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions) variables up to 
Month 24. The main analyses included: 
-  Pre-pubertal vs. pubertal subgroups baseline on Tanner staging score 
-  Age ≤12 yrs vs. >12 yrs subgroups 
-  Body weight at randomization visit ≤40 kg vs. >40 kg 
The first patient was enrolled on 26-Jul-2013, and the last patient completed the Core Phase on 14-Jul-2017 
(last treatment). In total, 214 (107 in each treatment group) of 215 randomized patients were treated by 
study drug; 1 patient in the IFN β-1a group was randomized but not treated due to inability to swallow study 
medication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018

The percent of screening failure showed high values (38.2%). On the other hand, 43 patients were 
randomized after rescreening (i.e. failed first screening). The majority (105/133 patients who failed at 
screening) of screening failure was due to strict exclusion criteria such as vaccination requirements and the 
need for positive antibody testing as proof for vaccination status. Amendments were implemented to change 
exclusion criteria and rescreening was authorised according to the initial protocol. Rescreening did not have 
any impact into the global MS paediatric population. 
At baseline, the groups were balanced for main demographic features, but not for pre-pubertal status and 
body weight ≤40 kg (significantly more pre-pubertal patients were included in fingolimod group vs IFN [7 vs 
3 patients] and also for those weighting ≤40 kg [9 vs 1 patients]). These two points are of interest regarding 
the subgroup analyses on main efficacy endpoints (primary and key secondary endpoints), because they can 
weaken the results and the conclusions from these comparisons.  
Regarding MS baseline characteristics, overall, they were well balanced between the two treatment groups 
showing similar level of disease activity prior to the study start. The study population consisted of relatively 
newly diagnosed MS patients, with a low mean baseline EDSS score of 1.54, and treatment naïve (~64% of 
patients). 
Since D2311 was a flexible duration the study (up to 24 months), patients exposure was variable. Thus: 
-  102 (95.3%) and 88 (82.2%) patients in the fingolimod and IFN β-1a groups respectively were exposed 
to ≥ 360 days (12 months) of study treatment 
-  74 (69.2%) and 55 (51.4%) patients in the fingolimod and IFN β-1a groups respectively were exposed 
to ≥ 540 days (18 months) of study treatment 
-  30 (28.0%) and 19 (17.8%) patients in the fingolimod and IFN β-1a groups respectively were exposed 
to ≥ 720 days (24 months) of study treatment. 
Since MS is a chronic disease and the treatment is intended to be used on a long-term period, there is a lack 
of comparative blinded data regarding: 
a.  The long-term efficacy data to support the maintenance effect of fingolimod; 
b.  The long-term safety data in this special population. 
These two points were discussed by the MAH. The Rapporteur acknowledges the efficacy of fingolimod 
demonstrated. The superiority of fingolimod to interferon beta is recognized. However, long term efficacy and 
safety data remains at the time being speculative and not clearly demonstrated in the results of this study.  
For the MAH, there is no evidence from the safety analysis of paediatric patients in Study D2311 to 
substantiate a ‘potentially worse’ safety profile to that of adults as was mentioned in the CHMP assessment 
report. This is endorsed at this stage with the available study data however the use in paediatric patients in 
PM is not expected to be different as compared to adults. There are very limited safety data available in 
paediatric patients. 
Regarding study discontinuation, the number of patients who discontinued from the Core phase and those 
from study drug prematurely for reasons other from lack of efficacy and adverse events (i.e. Physician's 
decision, Patient/guardian decision, Administrative problems, Protocol deviation, and Patient withdrew 
consent) were imbalanced between fingolimod and IFN beta-1a groups (more in IFN group). Indeed, in the 
Core phase, 13 patients in IFN beta-1a group versus 4 patients in fingolimod group discontinued their 
treatment for these other reasons. Also, those who discontinued the treatment prematurely were 11 in IFN 
group versus 5 patients in fingolimod group. Further explanation was given by the MAH as requested. The 
MAH did not identify noteworthy reason. This point is solved.

Similarly, the number of protocol deviations was high in this study (n=~360), taking into account that a 
subject with multiple occurrences of a protocol deviation is counted only once. A high number of protocol 
deviations was related to safety follow-up measures not fully respected by study investigators. This issue was 
discussed by the MAH: All protocol deviations led to corrective actions which included onsite retraining of the 
site and subsequent monitoring to ensure future compliance. None of these were considered to have affected 
patient safety or overall study results. This point is solved.  
 Regarding the primary efficacy endpoint (ARR) up to 24 months (analyzed using negative binomial [NB] 
regression), the results showed statistically superiority of fingolimod vs IFN β-1a in paediatric patients (10 to 
18 years) with MS (Table 1) with adjusted ARR estimate of 0.122 vs 0.675. This corresponded to a significant 
reduction (p<0.001) of 81.9% in ARR for fingolimod-treated patients compared with IFN β-1a-treated 
patients. 
Table 1. Annualized relapse rate (ARR) up to Month 24 (confirmed relapses) (FAS) 
The primary analysis was adjusted, among other covariates, on the pubertal status according to the IVRS and 
geographical regions (Eastern and Western Europe and rest of the world). A complementary sensitivity 
analysis of the primary criteria, adjusting on the pubertal status according to Tanner's score and on 
geographical regions where the Western Europe region is restricted to EU countries, and a By-country ARR 
ratios have been provided. A negative binomial regression model adjusted for treatment, region, pubertal 
status (the stratification factor in IVRS), subgroup, subgroup-by-treatment interaction, and baseline T2 lesion 
number was also provided. All these analysis were statistically significant in favour of fingolimod.  
Regarding the key secondary efficacy endpoint (new or newly enlarged T2 lesions up to Month 24), the data 
showed statistically significantly lower rate in fingolimod group compared with IFN β-1a group. Treatment 
with fingolimod resulted in a 52.6% reduction in the number of new or newly enlarged T2 lesions compared 
with IFN β-1a (p<0.001), see Table 2. 
The effect on MRI lesions in study 2311 is less than expected in adult population when indirect comparison on 
the effect on relapses is concerned.

Table 2. Annualized rate of the number of new or newly-enlarged T2 lesions compared to baseline 
up to Month 24 (Full analysis set) (table 11-7 of CSR) 
The MAH also conducted sub-group analyses, including: 
-  Excluding  patients  positive  for  neutralizing  antibodies  (NAbs)  in  the  IFN  β-1a  treatment  group  (81.5% 
ARR reduction in favour fof fingolimod); ARR ratio=0.185 (95% IC=0.109-0.314); p<0.001; 
-  Only DMT naive patients: 85.8% reduction in ARR (p<0.001), and a 53.4% reduction in the annualized 
rate  of  the  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarged  T2  lesions  (p<0.001)  up  to  24  months  in  fingolimod-
treated patients compared with IFN β-1a-treated patients 
-  Age ≤12, and also in Age 10, 11 and 12: the limited number of patients and the imbalanced repartition 
in subgroup of age (e.g. For 10 yrs, there were only 5 patients all in fingolimod group, for 11 yrs, there 
were 4 patients, 3 in fingolimod and 1 in IFN group) weaken the drawn conclusions.  
-  Baseline  body  weight  ≤40  kg  (and  >40  kg):  the  limited  number  of  patients  (10  patients  in  all  groups) 
and  its  imbalanced  repartition  between  groups  (9  in  fingolimod  and  1  patient  in  IFN  groups)  preclude 
drawing firm conclusions. 
-  Pubertal status - Tanner stage <2 (and >=2): as for weight sub-groups, the limited number of patients 
(10 in all groups) and its imbalanced repartition between groups (7 and 3 patients in fingolimod and IFN 
groups) would lead to doubtful conclusions.  
Other secondary endpoints of interest were analysed in this study, including: 
- 
- 
Time  to  first  relapse  and  proportion  of  relapse-free  patients:  results  were  in  line  with  previous 
efficacy results in favour of fingolimod (see Figure 1 and Table 1). 
The  EDSS  score  change  from  baseline:  no  significant  difference  was  observed  between  treatment 
groups,  even  if  the  mean  change  in  the  EDSS  score  at  EOS  compared  to  baseline  was  numerically 
improvement in the fingolimod group (−0.23) as compared to IFN β-1a group (0.22).  
-  Cognitive  testing:  the  results  did  not  show  a  difference  between  treatment  arms  after  12  and  24 
months of treatment for all five cognitive tests.

Notes 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In order to demonstrate fingolimod efficacy in relapsing remitting MS in children (10 to 18 years), the MAH 
conducted a clinical study (CFTY720 or D2311) with respect to the PIP approved by the EMA on 05-Dec-2008 
(EMEA-000087-PIP01-07; EMA decision P/125/2008).  
D2311 was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study, active-controlled, parallel group, multicenter 
study in paediatric patients (10 to <18 years old) with a confirmed diagnosis of MS with relapsing remitting 
course. Initially planned to be a fixed 24-month treatment duration study, assessing the efficacy and safety 
of fingolimod compared to IFN β-1a, it was amended to a flexible up to 24-month treatment duration study in 
November 2016. The study comprised of an open-label extension period of 5 years duration, in order to 
assess long term safety profile of fingolimod in this specific population. 
The population enrolled in this study (n=215; in a 1:1 ratio between fingolimod and IFN beta-1a) was 
composed of males (37.7%) and females (62.3%) (i.e. similar to sex-ratio repartition in general population), 
aged from 10 to 18 years. The number of children aged under 12 years was small (~10% of overall enrolled 
population, n=22) and limited for those who were pre-pubertal (Tanner staging score<2), n=10 (4.7% of 
overall study population). Regarding the disease progression stage and previous MS treatment, the mean 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 25/61 
  
  
 
 
 
EDSS score of included patients was 1.54 (median 1.5), the mean of MS duration since first symptom was 
2.1 years (median 1.5), and percent of treatment naïve patients was of 63.3% (while 32.1% had already 
been treated by an Interferon Beta treatment). Thus, the included population was manly composed of early 
stage and treatment naïve MS patients. 
The dose of IFN beta-1a used in this study was fixed, 30 µg once by week i.m, when the dose of fingolimod 
was adaptable according to:  
a.  Patient weight: 0.5 mg/d in patients > 40 kg and 0.25 mg/d in those ≤ 40 kg  
b.  On online PK assessment for those under 0.25 mg/d: the PK analyses where done at Month 1 and at 
Month 2 if the dose was increased to 0.5 mg/d after the first PK analysis. 
According to a population PK analysis, the MAH considered that the dose of 0.5 mg/d was suitable for 
children > 40 kg and 0.25 mg/d for those ≤ 40 kg. This is acceptable.  
The primary efficacy endpoint chosen for this study was the comparison of the Annual Relapse Rate between 
treatment groups, based on a negative binomial regression model with log link, using treatment, pubertal 
status, and region as factors and number of relapses within the previous two years before randomization as 
covariate. The choice of this endpoint is supported in this population, especially in this population. Indeed, 
MS in children presents a slower progression, relapses more often, and recovers better from relapses than 
MS in adults. 
The choices of the key secondary endpoint (new/newly enlarging T2 lesions) and the other secondary 
endpoints (including "Time to first relapse”/“Proportion of patients relapse-free") are also supported, these 
are reflecting (and related to) MS inflammatory activity (i.e. relapses), the most important component of this 
disease at this age/stage. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Regarding the primary efficacy endpoint, the results showed that fingolimod significantly reduced the Annual 
Relapses Rate (ARR) (confirmed relapses) up to Month-24 by almost 82% compared to IFN beta-1a (ratio 
0.181; IC95% 0.108-0.303; p<0.001). 
Similar results were observed with regards to the secondary endpoints (key and other secondary endpoints) 
in favour of fingolimod: 
-  Mean adjusted new/newly enlarging T2 lesions up to Month-24: 4.393 and 9.269 in fingolimod and IFN 
beta-1a groups, respectively (52.6% of reduction; rate ratio=0.474 - IC95%=0.361-0.622; p<0.001); 
- 
Time  to  first  confirmed  relapse  and  proportion  of  patients  free  of  relapse  at  Month-24:  85.7%  and 
38.8% in fingolimod and IFN beta-1a groups, respectively (reduction in the risk of 82.2% of reduction; 
hazard ratio=0.18 - IC95%=0.10-0.32; p<0.001); 
-  Mean  adjusted  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  up  to  Month  24:  number  of  lesions  of  0.436  and  1.282  in 
fingolimod and IFN beta-1a groups, respectively (66% of reduction, rate ratio: 0.340 - IC95%: 0.215, 
0.540; p<0.001). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy results from the current paediatric study (D2311) are in-line with those obtained from one of the 
pivotal studies (D2302) in RRMS adult patients, a 12-Month treatment trial (~44% were treatment-naïve 
patients), where fingolimod showed superiority over IFN beta-1a on most efficacy endpoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 26/61 
  
  
In D2302 adult study, the superiority of fingolimod was observed on the primary endpoint (ARR), one of the 
two key secondary endpoints1 (number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions), and other secondary endpoints 
(mainly the proportion of patients free of Gd-enhanced T1 lesions, the proportion of relapse-free patients, the 
proportion of patients free of new or newly enlarged T2 lesions at 12 month, the number of Gd-enhanced T1 
lesions, etc.).  
A number of important safety concerns have previously been identified for Gilenya in the adult population. 
This resulted in the granting of a marketing authorization for restricted use (patients with highly active 
disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one DMT or patients with rapidly 
evolving severe relapsing remitting MS, as described in 4.1). In addition, a number of measures to ensure 
safe and effective use of the product were implemented. The initial approval has been followed by several 
variations to update sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC with new safety concerns. 
Thus, fingolimod efficacy data are in line with those seen in adult patients suffering from highly active 
relapsing disease MS, where its indication was restricted due to the safety profile  "after at least one disease 
modifying therapy […]" or "in rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (2 or more 
disabling relapses in one year […])". According to the MAH, fingolimod seems to have the same safety profile 
in paediatric population as in adult population. Moreover, there is a lack of safety data in this population 
including on the long term, and also regarding the neuro- and sexual-development. Therefore in children, an 
indication reflecting the above points was proposed. 
Fingolimod seems to be an efficacious treatment and potentially a valuable alternative after the first line 
existing disease-modifying treatments (interferon and glatiramer acetate) have failed in paediatric MS 
patients.  
D2311 study enrolled patients from 10 to 18 years old. However, the number of patients aged 10-12 years 
and pre-pubertal patients (Tanner stage≤ 2) enrolled in this study, even though consistent with PDCO 
recommendations, creates uncertainties for the assessment of the B/R ratio in these subgroups. 
Therefore, as patients who were aged 10 to 12 years, had a weight <40kg, - were pre-pubertal (<2 Tanner 
stage scoring) were underrepresented and taking into that SAEs were found in a higher number in children 
and adolescents on fingolimod vs. IFN β-1a and differences seem to be even more pronounced in children 
≤ 12 years, which is of concern, further long term safety data are needed.  
The MAH was requested to propose a post authorization study to collect long term safety data, in addition of 
the proposed long term extension of D2311 study especially in the subpopulation (patients age ≤ 12 years, 
≤ 40 kg or Tanner Stage <2 (pre-pubertal) group).The MAH proposed to open the recruitment of additional 
patients in this sub-population in the current 5 year extension of D2311 study (through an amendment) 
instead of putting in place a new safety study. This was considered acceptable. 
Information that very limited data are available and proposal for additional data in this subpopulation is 
added in section 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 to inform prescribers as requested.  
1 But not on the second key secondary endpoint (3-month confirmed disability progression as measured by EDSS, no statistically 
significant difference was found between treatment arms).

2.5.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety profile of fingolimod has been characterized with data on AE and SAE issued from D2311 which 
included paediatric patients between 10 and < 18 year-old. In addition, as the sample size of paediatric 
patients in Study D2311 is limited (214 patients, 107 in fingolimod arm and 107 in interferon arm), and given 
that MS is an indication that fingolimod is already approved for adult patients, 3 MS studies in adults (Studies 
D2301, D2302, D2309) were pooled and presented side by side with Study D2311 Core Phase data as 
supportive safety data.  
214 patients were followed in the safety set of D2311 (107 in fingolimod arm and 107 in interferon arm). 
Among these 314 patients: 
- 10 patients were pre-pubertal subjects (Tanner staging score<2 e.g. Tanner staging = 1) (7 in fingolimod 
arm and 3 in interferon arm) therefore it is difficult to conclude anything in this category of age.  
- 9 patients were in the subgroup < 12 years and ≤ 40 kg (8 in fingolimod arm and 1 in interferon β1a arm) 
therefore it is difficult to conclude anything in this category of age.  
- 21 patients were in the subgroup ≤ 12 years (whatever the weight) (13 in fingolimod arm and 9 in 
interferon armβ1a) therefore it is difficult to conclude anything in this category of age.  
- 16 patients between 12 and 14 y-o in fingolimod arm and 19 in interferon arm (whatever the weight), the 
number of patients were also limited in this category of age. 
Regarding duration of the treatment, the large majority of patients were treated during 1 year (102 (95.3%) 
in fingolimod arm versus 88 (82.2%) in interferon arm) but only 28% of patients on fingolimod treatment 
arm (30/107) and 17.8% (19/107) on interferon arm were treated during 2 years (any age). It is therefore 
difficult to assess long-term safety in paediatric patient.  
No data is provided for long term exposure in paediatric population (e.g. ≥ 2 years of exposure). As this is a 
chronic pathology with theoretically no limit for treatment time duration this is also difficult to estimate the 
long term safety profile in this specific population.  
Adverse events 
The overall number of adverse events was similar in fingolimod group versus interferon group (95 versus 
102). 
Regarding the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders:  
Leukopenia, Lymphopenia and anaemia are the 3 most frequent AE in fingolimod arm. Of note, Lymphopenia 
and leukopenia (NMQ, Novartis MedDRA query) were reported in more paediatric patients in the fingolimod 
treatment group (n=25, IR=15.7) compared to the IFN β-1a treatment group (n=3, IR=1.8). That is 
expected taking into account the mechanism of action of fingolimod. 
Furthermore, white blood cell decreased is the most AEs reported in the SOC investigations (n=6 (IR =3.3 in 
fingolimod arm versus n=0 (IR=0) in interferon arm). There is indeed an effect of fingolimod that seems 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 28/61 
  
  
particularly noticeable regarding hematological disorders in paediatric population. This has to be considered 
in the perspective of long term use in children. This also should be closely monitored in paediatric population.  
Regarding the SOC infections and infestations:  
There is an imbalance between the fingolimod arm (64 (IR=67.6) and interferon arm 60 (IR=61.8). 
According to the MAH, no opportunistic infection were reported in the CT2311. However, it is to be noted that 
one case of Mycoplasma pneumonia was reported. 
Regarding the SOC nervous system disorders: 
The number of AEs in this SOC in the paediatric population was similar for the fingolimod group compared to 
the IFN β-1a group (n=46 (IR=37.8) versus n= 45 (IR = 43.2)). 
In adults, convulsions are an important potential risk in the RMP. Regarding CT in adult, the IR in FTY 0.5 mg 
arm is twice compared to IR in arm placebo (0.4 vs 0.2 for SMQ convulsion) but the difference was not 
statistically significant (IR ratio 1.77 (04.-10.52). Of note, according to the EuPSUR9 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001393/201702 - PRAC recommendation 28 September 2017), 56 cases of status 
epilepticus at least were reported in adult (DLP 28 Feb 2017). From the PRAC opinion, even if the frequency 
is stable during the time, there are still very severe cases taking into account that the number of cases is 
underestimated. Therefore, the question to add a warning in the SmPC to alert physician of the possible 
occurrence of convulsion, especially status epilepticus, and to be particularly vigilant in patients with 
underlying conditions is a safety concern discussed in PSUSA in adult.  
Furthermore, regarding fingolimod arm in D2311, 16 SAE were reported in patients ≤ 12 year-old including 5 
SAE in the SOC Nervous system disorders in 3 patients. Of note 4/5 were related to convulsion such as: 
generalized convulsions at Day 202, generalized tonico-clonic seizure at Day 320, Migraine without aura at 
Day 67, Convulsion at Day 251 and convulsion at D99. Regarding serious epileptic seizure (including at least 
2 generalized convulsions), the role of Fingolimod cannot be excluded, especially since there is no other 
explanation in those cases except MS reactivation. The second option could be that fingolimod might not be 
the appropriate treatment for those patients.  
Of note 22 patients were randomized in this CT in the subgroup ≤ 12 years including 13 in fingolimod arm 
and 9 in interferon arm. That means 9/13 patients experienced a SAE (69 %) in the fingolimod Arm. 5/9 
SAEs were in the SOC Neurology and 4/9 SAEs were related to convulsions. 2/13 patients included in 
fingolimod arm and reported a SAE with convulsions were ≤ 12 year-old. 
Assessment of causality is complicated by the fact that the incidence of epileptic seizures in MS patients is 
higher than in the general population. Also, the relatively long timeline of treatment with fingolimod prior to 
convulsive symptoms and the absence of action taken with study medication should be considered. In the 
view of the assessor, a causal relationship to fingolimod cannot be excluded, however. 
‘Seizures’ (uncommon) has already been added by the Applicant to the tabulated list of ADRs (uncommon) of 
the SmPC, together with the statement in section 4.8. A warning is also added in section 4.4 as requested.  
Regarding the SOC Cardiac disorders, the incidence rate is higher in fingolimod arm than in interferon 
arm (n=6 (IR 3.3) in fingolimod arm vs n=3 (IR 1.8) in interferon arm). Tachycardia (n=3 on fingolimod 
versus n=0 on interferon) is the most reported and all the other PT were reported once. Of note, 2 AEs of 
Electrocardiogram QT prolonged were reported in fingolimod arm (versus none in interferon arm).  
It is obvious that more patients required extending monitoring in the fingolimod arm, more patient required 
hospitalization also. There is a patient in the fingolimod treatment group t had an AVB I at 0.25 mg (FDO) 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 29/61 
  
  
and then an AVB type II when the dose was increased at 0.5 mg. No information is provided on the reason of 
the increase dose. 
Cardiac disorders should be closely monitored taking into account the known safety profile of fingolimod in 
adult. Of note, the MAH did not discuss cardiac disorders as this is an important and very serious (potentially 
fatal) risk in adult.  
Of note, the size of the study is small and patients in this study were excluded for select medical history, 
including severe cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic and other conditions, as well as for taking excluded medications 
that can explain the low number of cases (even if there are cases).  
Anyway, cases reported in this study strongly justify that the minimisation risk measures put in place in adult 
for cardiac risks are also necessary to be applied in children at least. It would be interesting to have the 
analysis of cardiac risk, hospitalisation, required prolonged monitoring by age and by weight (e.g. dose). Of 
note, 9 patients were treated at 0.25 mg and 5 were increased to 0.5 mg depending on their weight or 
pharmacokinetic parameters (it is not known). No analysis was done regarding the AE / SAE by dose (0.25 
mg and 0.5 mg) / weight (≤ and > 40 kg).  
Cardiac SAE occurred in a patient. The lack of knowledge on the AEs at 0.25 mg is a concern. 
Regarding the SOC Psychiatric disorders 
In the study D2311, the incidence rate is higher in fingolimod arm than in interferon arm (n=20 (IR 11.9) in 
fingolimod arm vs n=11 (IR 7.1) in interferon arm). It is important to consider that the brain of children and 
adolescent is not completely mature on a point of view of neurobiology and therefore cognitive and 
psychiatric behaviour are not comparable with adult.  
Psychiatric adverse effects are expected in adult population and SmPC already mentions “depression, 
depressed mood”.  
There is an evident risk factor for depression and anxiety by the underlying MS disease. But there are also 
still uncertainties regarding potential increased risk in paediatric patients. Indeed, in study D2311, there was 
a higher incidence in fingolimod treated paediatric patients compared to IFN β-1a paediatric treated patients. 
Depression, suicidal ideation and anxiety are listed and expected as class effect for interferon treatments 
such as IFN β-1a. Consequently, despite the small number of paediatric patients exposed, the imbalance 
observed for fingolimod versus IFN β-1a has to be considered as a signal in paediatric patients. 
To conclude, there is a rationale to further closely follow psychiatric disorders in children in future safety data 
but at this time it is not strong enough to propose inclusion in the RMP. Information in SmPC in sections 4.4 
and 4.8 appears sufficient, waiting for complementary data form the extensive PASS.  
Regarding the SOC General Disorders and administration site conditions, the incidence rate is higher 
in the interferon arm than in the fingolimod arm ((n=29 (IR 19.7) in fingolimod arm vs n=73 (IR 123.8) in 
interferon arm. Pyrexia (n=8 (IR=4.4) on fingolimod versus n=22 (IR=16.1 on interferon), Influence like 
illness (n=5 (IR=2.8) on fingolimod versus n=40 (IR=36.8) on interferon) and Chills ((n=1 (IR=0.5) on 
fingolimod versus n=11 (IR=7.4 on interferon) which are known and very common ADR on interferon 
treatment, are the most reported. It can be noticed that these high number of these common AE on 
interferon arm are mostly the reason that induces an imbalance of AEs in the interferon arm versus 
fingolimod.

Regarding the SOC investigation: 
More Blood cholesterol increased were reported in fingolimod arm than in interferon arm. LDL increased is 
more reported also in fingolimod arm. This is not expected in paediatric patients neither an ADR of 
fingolimod.  
The percentage of patients with notable elevations in total bilirubin (>20.52 μmol/L: 15.0% vs. 3.7%) and 
ALP (>116 U/L: 15.9% vs. 8.4%) were higher for the fingolimod group, elevations in transaminase levels 
were also reported (ALT ≥3xULN: 7.5% vs 5.6% patients; AST ≥3xULN: 0 vs 2.8% patients). Of note, one 
SAEs including ALT increase (severe, > 5 × ULN), and GGT increase (severe, GGT > 8 × ULN) was reported 
in an 11-year-old child. Regarding liver transamination elevation, the same precaution should be applied in 
children as in adult at least. 
Regarding the SOC metabolism and nutrition: 
More AEs are reported in fingolimod arm than in interferon arm in paediatric patients (9 versus 1). Decreased 
appetite (4 versus 0) and hypovitaminosis (3 versus 0) are the most reported AEs in fingolimod arm. Other 
AEs are reported once. Hypovitaminosis is not expected in paediatric patients. Decreased appetite is also 
surprising if we consider that patients improve on fingolimod treatment, this AE might not be reported. This 
might be a sign of impaired tolerance of fingolimod.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
No fatal cases were reported in any treatment arm. More SAEs were reported in fingolimod arm versus 
interferon. Indeed, 33 SAE occurred in 19 patients in fingolimod arm and 13 SAE occurred in 9 patients in 
interferon arm. In patient ≤ 12 year-old, 16 SAE were reported in fingolimod arm in 8 patients versus one 
SAE in interferon arm (the only SAE in patient ≤ 12 y-o in interferon arm was reported 38 days after the stop 
of interferon). Regarding pre-pubertal patient (Tanner staging score<2) 5 patients experienced a SAEs 
among the 7 patients included in fingolimod arm.  
The most frequently SAEs with fingolimod belong to the SOC neurology (4 events of Epileptic seizure 
including 2 events of generalized tonic clonic seizures in 2 patients). (Please refer above in the SOC 
neurology / AEs, where a synthesis is already proposed including SAE and AE). 
Discontinuation due to AES 
5 patients permanently discontinued the treatment permanently in each arm. The reasons to permanently 
discontinue in fingolimod arm were: MS relapse, Hypersensitivity, vasculitis, radiological worsening of 
multiple sclerosis lesions, leukopenia, Macular oedema.  
Regarding the patients who temporally discontinued the treatment, 12 AEs were reported in the fingolimod 
arm versus 3 in interferon arm. The principal reasons in fingolimod arm were convulsion and 
immunosuppression (leukopenia, lymphopenia, lymphocyte decreased, agranulocytosis, WBC decreased).  
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Around 100 patients were exposed for 1 year with fingolimod and only 28 % of patients on fingolimod 
treatment arm (30/107) and 17.8 % (19/107) on interferon arm were treated during 2 years (any age). Only 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 31/61 
  
  
10 patients were pre-pubertal subjects (Tanner staging score<2) (7 in fingolimod arm and 3 in interferon 
arm) therefore it is difficult to conclude anything in this category of age. 22 patients were in the subgroup ≤  
12 years (13 in Fingolimod arm and 9 in interferonβ1a arm) therefore it is difficult to conclude anything in 
this category of age. Of note, the number of patients between 12 and 14 y-o is also very small (16 in 
fingolimod arm and 19 in interferon arm).The overall number of adverse events were similar in fingolimod 
group versus interferon group (95 versus 102).Specific events of fingolimod involved mainly hematologic 
(Lymphopenia and total WBC), infectious (Upper respiratory tract infection), cardiovascular (tachycardia, QT 
prolongation), hepatic (mainly increases in ALT and GGT), and pulmonary (dyspnea) events. These AEs are 
expected taking into account the safety profile of fingolimod in adult. Of note, 2 SOC neurology (convulsion) 
and psychiatric disorders (anxiety, depressed mood and depression) reported a higher incidence of events in 
fingolimod treated patients compared to IFN β-1a treated patients, which is not known at the time being in 
adult.  
Regarding specific subpopulation in this study: 
Regarding patients ≤ 12 years: 21 patients were in the subgroup ≤ 12 years (13 in fingolimod arm and 9 in 
interferon armβ1a) in D2311. In this subgroup, 16 SAE were reported in fingolimod arm in 8 patients versus 
one SAE in interferon arm. The only SAE reported in interferon arm, is a patient who reported paronychia 38 
days after the last dose of interferon. This is worrying. 
Regarding Pre-pubertal subjects (Tanner staging score < 2): 10 pre-pubertal subjects were randomized in 
this CT, 7 on fingolimod and 3 on interferon: 5 patients had Tanner staging of 1 at visit 1 and experienced a 
SAE on fingolimod, none on interferon e.g. 5/10, 50 % of patients reported a SAE among all the patients 
including in this study at this age, 5/7 in the fingolimod arm had a SAE and all SAE were reported in 
fingolimod arm. Furthermore, all pre-pubertal patients in both the treatment groups reported at least an AE. 
Leucopenia (2 in fingolimod arm vs 0 in interferon arm), infection (Viral upper respiratory tract infection 6 vs. 
1 patient) and Gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (2 versus 0) and eczema (2 vs 0) were the most 
reported in fingolimod arm.  
Regarding long term data  
11 SAEs were reported > 360 days and < 720 days: Acute symptomatic seizures (655 days), Muscular 
weakness (618 days), Migraine (658 days), Appendicitis (390 days), Small bowel obstruction Gastrointestinal 
necrosis (Necrotic bowel) (481 days), Epilepsy (generalized tonic clonic seizures) (498 days), Epilepsy 
(Epileptic seizure) (604 days), Multiple sclerosis relapse (399 days), Multiple sclerosis plaque Radiological 
worsening of MS disease (378 days), Generalised tonic-clonic seizure (378 days), Autoimmune uveitis (401 
days). 
These 11 SAEs were reported by 9 patients. The age was between 11 and 17 year-old.  
Of note, 5 patients pre-pubertal subjects (Tanner staging score<2) had ≥ 360 days in this CT in the 
fingolimod arm. 1/5 experienced a SAE.  
9/19 (47 %) patients experienced SAE after at least one year of treatment on fingolimod.  
Among the 30 patients treated with fingolimod≥ 720 days, no SAE were reported. None pre-pubertal patients 
were exposed ≥ 720 days (24 months). Therefore, it is difficult to conclude anything taking into account the 
very low number of patients exposed and especially in pre pubertal stage. 
Of note, long term data (> 1 year) are limited in paediatric patients treated for more than one year, 
therefore the long term risk in patients >10 y-o is difficult to be assessed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 32/61 
  
  
Regarding the study D2311 results related to those specific subpopulation, only 9 patients below ≤ 40 kg 
were treated with fingolimod, started at the dose level of 0.25 mg, therefore it is difficult to draw definitive 
conclusion in this category of weight.  8/9 reported an AE (88.9%), 4/9 patients reported SAE (44.4%). 
Regarding postmarketing data, 7 years after the MA, it is no more possible to only consider the 3 pivotal 
studies to determine the safety profile in adult. At the time being, data from post marketing including safety 
studies (D2403, D2406 and D2409) and the 7 years of post-marketing data that is yearly assessed in the 
PSUSA (EuPSUR9 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001393/201702 - PRAC recommendation 28 September 2017), can 
allow to consider that fingolimod is known to induce the following 3 major risks in adult: 
- Bradycardia and polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia (due to the mechanism of action of fingolimod, e.g. a 
sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator) that requires a cardiologist examination before to start the 
treatment and a at least 6 hour ECH monitoring at initiation 
- Macular oedema that requires at least an ophthalmological evaluation at 3 to 4 months after treatment 
initiation 
- Immunosuppressive effect that predisposes patients to an infection risk, including opportunistic infections 
that can be fatal (such as PML and cryptococcal meningitis), and increases the risk of developing lymphomas 
and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin. Therefore, Physicians have to carefully monitor 
patients, especially those with concurrent conditions or known factors (such as previous immunosuppressive 
therapy). It is important to consider that if this risk is suspected, discontinuation of treatment should be 
considered by the physician on a case-by-case basis. Due to the risk of cutaneous neoplasms, an evaluation 
of the skin is recommended at initiation and then every 6 to 12 months taking into consideration clinical 
judgement. 
Other potential and identified important risks are also carefully monitored in adults (please see RMP section).  
Furthermore, as mentioned in the Guideline on conduct of pharmacovigilance for medicines used by the 
paediatric population (Ref. EMEA/CHMP/PhVWP/235910/2005- rev.) “Safety data cannot necessarily be 
extrapolated from data in adults because certain ADRs may only be seen in the paediatric population 
depending on the maturation of organ systems (e.g. skin, airways, kidney, liver, blood-brain-barrier), 
metabolism, growth and development in the case of life-long treatments for chronic diseases, the total 
duration of treatment is longer if started in childhood. This may expose the patient to increased risks of 
developing an ADR”.  
The MAH reviewed post marketing paediatric patients as requested. A total of 916 events were reported in 
385 paediatric patients in PM data. Of note, there were cumulatively 40 cases with children between 1 and 
12Y old (30 between 3 and 12Y), including 11 serious HCP cases. The analysis of paediatric post marketing 
data are not convincing to conclude that the safety profile of fingolimod is more favourable in children than in 
adults. 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Fingolimod has many known very serious, potentially fatal risks, in particular due to the mechanism of action 
(immunosuppressive effect) and long term treatment is a safety concern in particular in paediatric patients. 
Limited safety data are available on the long term (> 1 year and especially > 2 years). Because of the 
uncertainties related to the small number of paediatric patients included in this clinical trial, and especially 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 33/61 
  
  
the very few data for children < 12 years old and < 40 kg, further long term safety data in paediatric 
population are needed.  
Overall, the safety profile in adult is already known and is expected to be similar in the paediatric population. 
Furthermore, there seems to be additional safety concerns regarding neurological AEs and psychiatric 
disorders. The SmPC was updated accordingly. 
Of note, very long term data missing in paediatric patients and the number of patient exposed is small, 
therefore the long term risk in paediatric patients at this time should be further studied. Further long term 
data are awaited both from long term extension study and from long term data in a larger number of patients 
that could document the safety profile of fingolimod in paediatric population.

The MAH proposal to open the recruitment of additional patients in the subpopulation of patients aged ≤12 
years, ≤40  kg  or  Tanner  Stage  <2  (pre-pubertal)  group.sub-population  in  the  current  5-year  extension  of 
D2311 study (through an amendment), instead of put in place a new safety study, is acceptable provided the 
following conditions are met: 
- The safety assessments should be added and closely followed by the MAH; 
-The MAH should modify selection criteria of the study to include patients with highly active relapsing 
remitting multiple sclerosis aged ≤12 years, ≤40 kg or Tanner Stage <2 (pre-pubertal) group: 
- Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one 
disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 
5.1) 
Or 
-  Patients  with  rapidly  evolving  severe  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more 
disabling  relapses  in  one  year,  and  with  1  or  more  Gadolinium  enhancing  lesions  on  brain  MRI  or  a 
significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
A one year interim data of safety data for this specific subpopulation is expected. Pooled analysis with data of 
patients already included can be done if possible considering characteristics of the patients. 
In order to update the inclusion criteria, a revised protocol for study D2311 should be submitted for review 
and  approval  within  2  months  from  the  EU  commission  decision.  The  MAH  also  agreed  to  submit  the  first 
interim report during the latter half of 2020. Thereafter, annual reports will be submitted annually.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous 
system (CNS), characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and axonal/neuronal destruction ultimately 
leading to severe disability. The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes 
of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, exacerbations, attacks) followed by 
improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10–15% of 
cases). A combination of these two patterns may also occur or people may start in a relapsing and remitting 
course that then becomes progressive later on. 
The initial course of MS is more often relapsing (-remitting) in paediatric onset MS (>98%) than in adult 
onset (approximately 85%). The relapse rate in paediatric MS is reported to be 2-3 times higher than in adult 
onset. 
Available data showed that MRI features in paediatric MS are similar to adult relapsing MS. Children, 
however, tend to have a higher number of T2 lesions at the time of first event than adults and a lower 
propensity for lesions to enhance with gadolinium (Gd).  
Treatment strategies in paediatric MS, as for adults, are focused on treatment of acute relapses, MS 
symptoms, and disease-modification.  
Disease-modification treatments aim to reduce relapses in MS relapsing-remitting forms, which eventually 
should lead to delay disease progression occurrence. Thus, the main endpoints of interest in this disease 
form, especially in children, are the reduction of annual relapse rate (ARR) and MRI findings (most sensitive 
tool currently available to monitor inflammatory disease activity).  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Despite limited published data suggesting that the efficacy and safety profile in adolescents (≥12 years of 
age) is similar to that seen in adults, 3 IFN β agents (2 IFN β-1a and 1 IFN β-1b) and glatiramer acetate are 
allowed to be used in paediatric patients with MS according to the dosage and administration sections of the 
EU summary of product characteristics (SmPC). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical study 
D2311 a phase 3, flexible duration (up to 2 years), double-blind, double dummy, randomized, multi-center, 
active controlled study evaluating the efficacy/safety of fingolimod once daily (weight-based dosing; 0.25 mg 
≤40 kg or 0.5 mg >40 kg) vs IFN β-1a 30 μg im once/week.  
The study included children aged 10 to 18 years old, suffering from RRMS, in majority composed of: 
-  Newly diagnosed MS patients,  
-  With a low mean baseline EDSS score (disability score) of 1.54, 
- 
Treatment naïve patients (~64%), 
-  Aged > 12 years (~90%) 
- 
Pubertal at baseline according to Tanner staging score >= 2 (94.4%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 48/61 
  
  
-  Weighting > 40 kg (95.3%) 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint was ARR, defined as the average number of confirmed relapses per year. Regarding 
this endpoint, fingolimod showed statistically superiority vs IFN β-1a with adjusted ARR estimate of 0.122 vs 
0.675. This corresponded to a significant reduction (p<0.001) of 81.9% in ARR for fingolimod-treated 
patients compared with IFN β-1a-treated patients. 
The key secondary variable was the annualized rate of the number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions 
(n/neT2) from baseline to up to Month-24, which showed statistically significantly lower rate in fingolimod 
group compared with IFN β-1a group, with a 52.6% reduction in the number of new or newly enlarged T2 
lesions (p<0.001). 
Fingolimod showed also superiority over IFN beta-1a regarding other secondary endpoints: 
- 
- 
The time to first confirmed relapse was significantly delayed in fingolimod-treated patients compared to 
IFN β-1a-treated patients (log-rank test p<0.001).  
The  risk  of  confirmed  relapse  up  to  2  years  was  significantly  reduced  (82.2%)  with  fingolimod 
compared with IFN β-1a (hazard ratio of 0.18; p<0.001). 
Also, supportive, sensitivity analyses, and subgroup (pre-planned or post-hoc) analyses on primary and key 
secondary endpoints confirmed those observed with primary and key secondary endpoints.  
Similar results were observed in RRMS adult patients study (D2302), a 12-Month treatment trial (~44% were 
treatment-naïve patients), where fingolimod showed superiority over IFN beta-1a in one of the pivotal studies 
(D2302) on most efficacy endpoints.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
According to the claimed indication in paediatric patients: 
"Gilenya is indicated as a single disease modifying therapy for the treatment of paediatric patients of 10 
years of age and above with relapsing multiple sclerosis." 
Dose adjustment recommendation in children is set-up according to children weight: 
- 
- 
Paediatric patients with body weight ≤40 kg: one 0.25 mg capsule taken orally once daily. 
Paediatric patients with body weight >40 kg: one 0.5 mg capsule taken orally once daily. 
The rational of cut-off weight of 40 kg was endorsed. 
As mentioned earlier regarding age, puberty status, and weight subgroups in the population included in the 
main study, the repartition is unbalanced between treatment groups and the overall number of patients in 
the lower subgroup ranges is limited (see the table below). It is understood that this follows the 
recommendations issued by the PDCO, but still creates uncertainties for the assessment of the B/R ratio in 
these subgroups.

These uncertainties should be taken into account with regards to the known fingolimod safety profile. 
Since the study design was updated from fixed to flexible study duration (up to 24 months), there are limited 
efficacy and safety data comparing fingolimod to IFN β-1a. Indeed, only 30 (28.0%) patients in fingolimod 
group and 19 (17.8%) patients in the IFN β-1a group completed 24 months of treatment (see also below the 
durations of exposure in fingolimod group): 
-  102 (95.3%) patients in the fingolimod group were exposed to ≥360 days (12 months) of treatment 
-  74 (69.2%) patients in the fingolimod group were exposed to ≥540 days (18 months) of treatment 
-  30 (28.0%) patients in the fingolimod group were exposed to ≥720 days (24 months) of treatment. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The current fingolimod indication in adults RRMS patients is as follows: 
"Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
for the following adult patient groups: 
- Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease 
modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
or 
- Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling 
relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase 
in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI." 
This restricted indication was given with regards to fingolimod safety profile, which is in adult population well 
characterised at present, taking into account post marketing safety data available from PSURs.  
Since the safety profile of fingolimod in paediatric population is considered the same as in adult population, 
the 3 major risks should also be considered in children: 
-  Bradycardia and polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia; 
-  Macular oedema; 
- 
Immunosuppressive  effect  that  predisposes  patients  to  the  risk  of  infections,  including  opportunistic 
infections  that  can  be  fatal  (such  as  cryptococcal  meningitis,  herpetic  encephalitis,  ….)  and  increases 
the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin.  
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 50/61 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All these risks, as for other potential and identified risks, have to be carefully monitored in adult (please refer 
to fingolimod RMP) and in paediatric patients.  
Overall, there are safety concerns especially regarding immunity (as in adult population), but also 
neurological (convulsion and generalized tonico-clonic seizure) and psychiatric disorders (depression and 
anxiety) according to safety data from Study D2311, which are of special concern in this particular 
population. 
Moreover, the overall incidence of SAEs was higher in patients treated with fingolimod (33 SAE in 19 patients, 
17.8%) compared with IFN β-1a (13 in 10 patients, 9.3%). AEs requiring temporally interruption of study 
drug were more frequent in the fingolimod group than in the IFN β-1a treatment group (11.2% vs 2.8%, 
respectively) and this difference was due to primary SOCs of investigations (4 patients with ALT/AST 
abnormal, blood pressure increased, lymphocyte or white blood cell count decreased), nervous system 
disorders (2 patients with seizure and 1 patient with tonic-clonic seizure), and blood and lymphatic disorders 
(2 patients with leukopenia, 1 patient with agranulocytosis and 1 patient with lymphopenia). 
Among the 19 patients from fingolimod group who experienced SAEs, 8 were ≤ 12 years (13 patients ≤ 12 
years were included in this study) how reported 16 SAEs. In interferon subgroup of patients aged ≤ 12 years, 
one SAE (paronychia) was reported 38 days after stopping the treatment (relationship with interferon 
treatment is therefore unlikely). Also, 10 pre-pubertal subjects (Tanner staging score<2) were randomized in 
the study, 7 in fingolimod group. All pre-pubertal patients (100%) reported at least an AE. Among these 
patients 5 experienced a SAE on fingolimod, and none in interferon group. Thus, the safety profile of 
fingolimod in this special subgroup of patients (Tanner 1 or 12 years and below) appears to be more 
severe/serious than in older children and adult population. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of fingolimod is limited due to the limited number of patients exposed to fingolimod 
in D2311 study.  
Moreover, there is a lack or at least very limited safety data regarding: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Long-term exposure to fingolimod, which is an immunosuppressive molecule; 
Patients aged 12 years and less; 
Patients 40 kg and less; 
Pre-pubertal population, and thus lack of data regarding sexual development; 
-  Behaviour, cognitive and physical development in this special (paediatric) population. 
For note, a rebound effect must be considered when stopping treatment with fingolimod. This should be 
taken into account when considering that MS concerns mainly young female patients that could have a desire 
of pregnancy and need to stop fingolimod treatment. Females adolescent, who wish to procreate in the 
future, could face this issue if they are on fingolimod treatment.

to be specified 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The efficacy of fingolimod in the treatment of RRMS adult patients is already known and demonstrated in 
relation to authorised medicinal products. The efficacy data from Study D2311 in children with RRMS aged 10 
to 18 years are consistent with those from adult patients, including one of the pivotal adult study comparing 
fingolimod to IFN beata-1a (D2302).  
In paediatric study (D2311), as in adult study (D2302), fingolimod showed significant superiority over IFN 
beta-1a regarding the primary endpoint (ARR), the key secondary endpoint (new/newly enlarging T2 lesions), 
other secondary endpoints (Time to first confirmed relapse and proportion of patients free of relapse at 
Month-24; Gd-enhancing T1 lesions, etc.) and some pre- or post-planned sub-groups analyses of interest 
(ex. excluding Nabs-positive patients from IFN beta-1a group and DMT naive patients only).  
However, these efficacy data are still lacking in some aspects regarding: 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 53/61 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
The limited number of patients having sufficient duration of exposure: only 30 (28.0%) patients in the 
fingolimod  group  and  19  (17.8%)  patients  in  the  IFN  β-1a  group  were  exposed  to  ≥  720  days  (24 
months) of study treatment;  
-  Body  weight  ≤40  kg:  the  number  of  patients  this  subgroup  is  limited  (10  patients,  9  in  fingolimod 
group) and rational of the chosen cut-off of 40 kg allowing dose adjustment (0.25 mg/d or 0.5 mg/d) 
is not fully provided; 
-  Age ≤ 12 years: the number of patients this subgroup is also limited (22 patients) and their repartition 
between  treatment  groups  by  age  range  (10,  11  and  12  years)  is  very  unbalanced  (10  years:  5 
patients all in fingolimod group, 11 years: 3/4 patients were in fingolimod group); 
- 
Pre-pubertal status (Tanner <2): the number of patients in this subgroup is also limited (10 patients) 
and  their  repartition  between  treatment  groups  is  unbalanced  (7  in  fingolimod  and  3  in  interferon 
group, respectively). 
Regarding safety profile of fingolimod in paediatric population, and as claimed by the MAH, this profile seems 
to be similar to what is known in adult population (this assumption should be considered as the better case at 
present time). Therefore, the 3 major risks (cardiac, ocular, and immunosuppressive effects) and all other 
known risks related to fingolimod should be taken into account in the benefit/risk assessment of fingolimod 
treatment in RRMS in children. 
Furthermore, since MS concerns mainly young female that could have a desire of pregnancy, a rebound effect 
must be considered after stopping treatment with fingolimod in adolescent females on fingolimod treatment. 
Females adolescent, who wish to procreate in the future, could face this issue if they are on fingolimod 
treatment.  
It is also important to notice the increased risk of AEs/SAEs/AEs leading to study drug interruption in some 
subgroup of patients (≤ 12 years and pre-pubertal patients). 
Finally, there is a lack of long term safety data in all paediatric population, and mostly in those aged 12 years 
and less, pre-pubertal patients, and weighing ≤40 kg, and limited data for patients aged more than 12 years. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks and conclusion 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the overall benefit- risk balance of fingolimod is 
considered positive in the following indication: 
“Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
for the following groups of adult patients and paediatric patients aged 10 years and older: 
-       Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one 
disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
or 
-       Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more 
disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant 
increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.” 
This is due to the fact that the efficacy of fingolimod in this population has been sufficiently demonstrated, 
but the risks that the treatment presents with are the same for both the adult and paediatric population, so a 
similar indication as in adults was agreed on.  
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 54/61 
  
  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of, Gilenya 0.25 mg, hard capsules is favourable in the following indication: 
“Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
for the following groups of adult patients and paediatric patients aged 10 years and older: 
-       Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one 
disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
or 
-       Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more 
disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant 
increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Gilenya subject to the 
following conditions:

being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior  to  launch  of  GILENYA  in  each  Member  State  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  must  agree 
about  the  content  and  format  of  the  educational  programme,  including  communication  media,  distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority (NCA).  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State (MS) where GILENYA is marketed, all physicians who intend 
to prescribe GILENYA are provided with an updated Physician Information Pack, including:  
1. 
2. 
3. 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC); 
Physician’s  checklist  for  adult  and  paediatric  patients,  to  consider  prior  to  prescribing  GILENYA, 
including  information  about  the  fingolimod  Pregnancy  Outcomes  Intensive  Monitoring  Program  and 
the Pregnancy Exposure Registry; 
The  reminder  card,  to  be  provided  to  all  patients,  their  parents  (or  legal  representatives),  and 
caregivers  
Physician’s checklist 
The physician’s checklist shall contain the following key messages: 
•  Monitoring requirements at treatment initiation: 
Before first dose 
o  Perform baseline ECG prior to the first dose of GILENYA; 
o  Perform blood pressure measurement prior to the first dose of GILENYA; 
o  Perform a liver function test prior to (within 6 months) treatment initiation; 
o  Arrange  ophthalmological  assessment  before  starting  GILENYA  treatment  in  patients  with  diabetes 
mellitus or with a history of uveitis; 
Until 6 hours after first dose 
o  Monitor  the  patient  for  6  hours  after  the  first  dose  of  GILENYA  has  been  administered  for  signs  and 
symptoms  of  bradycardia,  including  hourly  pulse  and  blood  pressure  checks.  Continuous  (real  time) 
ECG monitoring is recommended; 
o  Perform an ECG at the end of the 6-hour monitoring period. 
>6 to 8 hours after first dose 
o 
If, at the 6-hour time point, the heart rate is at the lowest value following the first dose, extend heart 
rate monitoring for at least 2 more hours and until the heart rate increases again. 
•  Recommendation for re-initiating GILENYA therapy after treatment interruption: 
The same first dose monitoring as for treatment initiation is recommended when treatment is interrupted 
for: 
o  One day or more during the first 2 weeks of treatment; 
o  More than 7 days during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment; 
o  More than 2 weeks after at least 1 month of treatment. 
•  Recommendation for overnight monitoring after the first dose (or if the first dose monitoring applies during 
treatment re-initiation): 
o  Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until resolution of findings 
in  patients  requiring  pharmacological  intervention  during  monitoring  at  treatment  initiation/re-
initiation. Repeat the first dose monitoring after the second dose of GILENYA; 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018

o  Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until resolution of findings 
in patients: 
•  With third degree AV block occurring at any time; 
•  Where at the 6-hour time point: 
a. Heart rate <45 bpm, <55 bpm in paediatric patients  aged 12 years old and above, or <60 
bpm in paediatric patients 10 to below 12 years of age; 
b. New onset second degree or higher AV block; 
c. QTc interval >500 msec. 
•  GILENYA is contraindicated in patients with: 
o  Known immunodeficiency syndrome; 
o  Patients  with  increased  risk  for  opportunistic  infections,  including  immunocompromised  patients 
(including  those  currently  receiving  immunosuppressive  therapies  or  those  immunocompromised  by 
prior therapies); 
o  Severe active infections, active chronic infections (hepatitis, tuberculosis); 
o  Known active malignancies; 
o  Severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C); 
o 
In  the  previous  6  months,  myocardial  infarction  (MI),  unstable  angina  pectoris,  stroke/transient 
ischaemic  attack  (TIA),  decompensated  heart  failure  (requiring  inpatient  treatment),  or  New  York 
Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV heart failure; 
o  Severe  cardiac  arrhythmias  requiring  anti-arrhythmic  treatment  with  class  Ia  or  class  III  anti-
arrhythmic drugs; 
o  Second-degree  Mobitz  type  II  atrioventricular  (AV)  block  or  third-degree  AV  block,  or  sick-sinus 
syndrome, if they do not wear a pacemaker; 
o  Patients with a baseline QTc interval ≥500 msec; 
o  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.  
•  GILENYA is not recommended in patients with: 
o  Sino-atrial heart block; 
o  QTc  prolongation  >470  msec  (adult  females),  QTc  >460 msec  (paediatric  females)  or  >450  msec 
(adult and paediatric males); 
o  History of cardiac arrest; 
o  Severe sleep apnea; 
o  History of symptomatic bradycardia; 
o  History of recurrent syncope; 
o  Uncontrolled hypertension; 
If  GILENYA  treatment  is  considered  in  these  patients  anticipated  benefits  must  outweigh  potential  risks 
and  a  cardiologist  must  be  consulted  to  determine  appropriate  monitoring,  at  least  overnight  extended 
monitoring is recommended. 
•  GILENYA  is  not  recommended  in  patients  concomitantly  taking  medicines  known  to  decrease  the  heart 
rate.  If  GILENYA  treatment  is  considered  in  these  patients  anticipated  benefits  must  outweigh  potential 
risks and a cardiologist must be consulted to switch to non-heart-rate-lowering therapy or, if not possible, 
to determine appropriate monitoring. At least overnight extended monitoring is recommended; 
•  GILENYA  reduces  peripheral  blood  lymphocyte  counts.  Peripheral  lymphocyte  count  (CBC)  should  be 
checked  in  all  patients  prior  to  initiation  (within  6  months  or  after  discontinuation  of  prior  therapy)  and 
monitored  during  treatment  with  GILENYA.  Treatment  should  be  interrupted  if  lymphocyte  count  is 
confirmed as <0.2x109/L. The approved dosing of 0.5 mg once daily (or 0.25 mg once daily in paediatric 
patients  10  years  of  age  and  above  with  a  body  weight  of  ≤40  kg)  when  restarting  Gilenya  should  be 
administered. Other dosing regimens have not been approved. 
•  GILENYA  has  an  immunosuppressive  effect  that  predisposes  patients  to  an  infection  risk,  including 
opportunistic  infections  that  can  be  fatal,  and  increases  the  risk  of  developing  lymphomas  (including 
mycosis  fungoides)  and  other  malignancies,  particularly  those  of  the  skin.  Surveillance  should  include 
vigilance  for  both  skin  malignancies  and  mycosis  fungoides.  Physicians  should  carefully  monitor  patients, 
especially  those  with  concurrent  conditions  or  known  factors,  such  as  previous  immunosuppressive

therapy. If this risk is suspected, discontinuation of treatment should be considered by the physician on a 
case-by-case basis. 
o  Treatment  initiation  in  patients  with  severe  active  infection  should  be  delayed  until  the  infection  is 
resolved.  Suspension  of  treatment  during  serious  infections  should  be  considered.  Anti-neoplastic, 
immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies should not be co-administered due to the risk of 
additive  immune  system  effects.  For  the  same  reason,  a  decision  to  use  prolonged  concomitant 
treatment with corticosteroids should be taken after careful consideration. 
o  Vigilance  for  basal  cell  carcinoma  and  other  cutaneous  neoplasms  including  malignant  melanoma, 
squamous  cell  carcinoma,  Kaposi’s  sarcoma  and  Merckel  cell  carcinoma  is  recommended,  with  skin 
examination  prior  to  treatment  initiation  and  then  every  6  to  12  months  taking  into  consideration 
clinical  judgement.  Patients  should  be  referred to  a dermatologist  if  suspicious  lesions  are  detected. 
Caution  patients  against  exposure  to  sunlight  without  protection.  These  patients  should  not  receive 
concomitant phototherapy with UV-B-radiation or PUVA-photochemotherapy. 
•  Patients  should  be  instructed  to  report  signs  and  symptoms  of  infections  immediately  to  their  prescriber 
during and for up to two months after treatment with GILENYA; 
o  Prompt diagnostic evaluation should be performed in patient with symptoms and signs consistent 
with cryptococcal meningitis; appropriate treatment, if diagnosed, should be initiated.  
Reports  of  cryptococcal  meningitis  (sometimes  fatal)  have  been  received  after  approximately 
2-3 years of treatment, although an exact relationship with the duration of treatment is unknown. 
o  Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or MRI findings suggestive of PML. If PML is 
suspected, treatment with GILENYA should be suspended until PML has been excluded. 
Cases of PML have occurred after approximately 2-3 years of monotherapy treatment although an 
exact relationship with the duration of treatment is unknown. 
o  Specific recommendations regarding vaccination for patients initiating or currently on GILENYA 
treatment. Check varicella zoster virus (VZV) antibody status in patients without a healthcare 
professional confirmed history of chickenpox or documentation of a full course of varicella 
vaccination. If negative, a full course of vaccination with varicella vaccine is recommended and 
treatment initiation should be delayed for 1 month to allow full effect of vaccination to occur.  
o  Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, including papilloma, dysplasia, warts and HPV-related cancer, 
has been reported in the post-marketing setting. Cancer screening, including Pap test, and 
vaccination for HPV-related cancer is recommended for patients, as per standard of care. 
•  A full ophthalmological assessment should be considered: 
o  3-4 months after starting GILENYA therapy for the early detection of visual impairment due to drug-
induced macular edema; 
o  During treatment with GILENYA in patients with diabetes mellitus or with a history of uveitis. 
•  GILENYA is teratogenic. Therefore, women of childbearing potential, including female adolescents should 
avoid pregnancy during GILENYA treatment; a negative pregnancy test result should be confirmed prior 
to starting treatment, and it should be repeated at suitable intervals; 
Women of child-bearing potential, including adolescent females, their parents (or legal representatives), 
and  caregivers,  should  be  informed  about  the  serious  risks  of  GILENYA  to  the  fetus.  Effective 
contraception during treatment and for at least two months following treatment discontinuation should be 
recommended. 
While on treatment, women should not become pregnant. Treatment discontinuation is recommended if a 
patient becomes pregnant. 
• 
Liver function should be monitored at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 during GILENYA therapy and periodically 
thereafter; the approved dosing of 0.5 mg daily (or 0.25 mg once daily in paediatric patients 10 years of 
age and above with a body weight of ≤40 kg) should be administered. Other dosing regimens have not 
been approved.

• 
In the post-marketing setting, severe exacerbation of disease has been observed rarely in some patients 
stopping  fingolimod.  The  possibility  of  recurrence  of  exceptionally  high  disease  activity  should  be 
considered.   
•  Cases of seizure, including status epilepticus, have been reported. Physicians should be vigilant for 
seizures and especially in those patients with underlying conditions or with a pre-existing history or 
family history of epilepsy. 
Physicians should provide patients with the patient reminder card. 
Physicians  should  reassess  on  an  annual  basis  the  benefit  of  GILENYA  treatment  versus  risk  in  each 
patient, especially paediatric patients. 
• 
• 
The  safety  profile  in  paediatric  patients  is  similar  to  adults  and  therefore  the  warnings  and  precautions  in 
adults also apply for paediatric patients.  
Specifically with paediatric patients, physicians should also: 
o  Assess Tanner staging and measure height and weight as per standard of care; 
o  Perform cardiovascular monitoring; 
o  Take  precautions  when  the  first  dose  is  administered  /  patients  are  switched  from  0.25  to  0.5  mg 
daily, due to the potential for bradyarrhythmia; 
o  Monitor the patient for sign and symptoms of depression and anxiety; 
o  Emphasize treatment compliance and misuse to patients, especially about treatment interruption and 
the importance of repeating cardiovascular monitoring; 
o  Emphasize GILENYA immunosuppressive effects; 
o  Consider a complete vaccination schedule before starting GILENYA; 
o  Provide guidance on seizure monitoring. 
Patient/ Parent / Caregiver Reminder Card 
The reminder card shall contain the following key messages: 
• 
Patients should have a baseline ECG and blood pressure measurement prior to receiving the first dose of 
GILENYA; 
•  Heart rate should be monitored for 6 or more hours after the first dose of GILENYA, including hourly 
pulse and blood pressure checks. Patients may be monitored with continuous ECG during the first 6 
hours. An ECG at 6 hours should also be performed and, in some circumstances, monitoring may involve 
an overnight stay; 
Patients should call their doctor in case of treatment interruption as the first dose monitoring may need 
to be repeated, depending on duration of interruption and time since starting of GILENYA treatment; 
Patients should report immediately symptoms indicating low heart rate (such as dizziness, vertigo, 
nausea or palpitations) after the first dose of GILENYA; 
• 
• 
•  GILENYA is not recommended in patients with cardiac disease or those taking medicines concomitantly 
known to decrease heart rate, and they should tell any doctor they see that they are being treated with 
GILENYA. 
•  Signs and symptoms of infection, which should be immediately reported to the prescriber physician 
• 
during and up to two months after GILENYA treatment. 
The need to undergo cancer screening, including Pap test, and vaccination for HPV-related cancer, as per 
standard of care, will be assessed by the prescriber physician; 
•  Any symptoms of visual impairment should be reported immediately to the prescriber during and for up 
to two months after the end of treatment with GILENYA. 
•  GILENYA is teratogenic. Women of child-bearing potential, including adolescent females, should be 
informed about GILENYA’s serious risks to the fetus and must: 
o  Have a negative pregnancy test before starting GILENYA; 
Assessment report  
EMA/779102/2018 
Page 59/61 
  
  
 
 
o  Be  using  effective  contraception  during  and  for  at  least  two  months  following  discontinuation  of 
GILENYA treatment; 
o  Report immediately to the prescribing physician any (intended or unintended) pregnancy during and 
up to two months following discontinuation of GILENYA treatment; 
•  A liver function test should be performed prior to treatment initiation; liver function monitoring should be 
performed at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 during GILENYA therapy, and periodically thereafter; 
•  Skin cancers have been reported in MS patients treated with GILENYA. Patients should inform their doctor 
immediately  if  any  skin  nodules  (e.g.,  shiny,  pearly  nodules),  patches  or  open  sores  that  do  not  heal 
within  weeks  are  noted.    Symptoms  of  skin  cancer  may  include  abnormal  growth  or  changes  of  skin 
tissue (e.g., unusual moles) with a change in color, shape or size over time; 
•  Seizure  may  occur.  The  doctor  should  be  informed  about  a  pre-existing  history  or  family  history  of 
epilepsy; 
•  Stopping  GILENYA  therapy  may  result  in  return  of  disease  activity.  The  prescribing  physician  should 
decide whether and how the patient should be monitored after stopping GILENYA. 
Specifically for Paediatric patients: 
The following should be considered: 
• 
• 
Physicians should assess Tanner staging and measure height and weight as per standard of care; 
Precautions should be taken during the first dose of GILENYA and when patients are switched from 0.25 
to 0.5 mg daily; 
•  Depression and anxiety are known to occur with increased frequency in the MS population and have been 
reported also in paediatric patients treated with GILENYA; 
•  Cardiac monitoring guidance; 
• 
Patients  should  ensure  medication  compliance  and  avoid  misuse,  especially  treatment  interruption,  and 
repeat cardiac monitoring; 
•  Signs and symptoms of infection;  
•  Seizure monitoring guidance.

Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Stimufend (Pegfilgrastim) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Stimufend. The RMP details 
important risks of Stimufend, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will 
be obtained about Stimufend 's risks. Stimufend 's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) 
and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how 
Stimufend should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Stimufend should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Stimufend 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Stimufend is authorized for reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile 
neutropenia (FN) in adult patients (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains pegfilgrastim as 
the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Stimufend benefits can be found in Stimufend’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine's webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/stimufend. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further characterize the 
risks
Important  risks  of Stimufend,  together with measures  to  minimize such  risks  and  the proposed 
studies for learning more about Stimufend's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Stimufend are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Stimufend. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important Identified risk: Capillary leak syndrome 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Data to evaluate the safety concerns are derived from available data sources, 
the medicine 
including clinical studies and postmarketing adverse event reporting. There 
were no events of capillary leak syndrome in pegfilgrastim placebo controlled 
clinical studies. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Capillary leak syndrome has been reported after administration of multiple 
drugs, some of which include interleukins, gemcitabine, granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating and interferon. Capillary leak syndrome has 
also been reported in relation to miscellaneous conditions such as carbon 
monoxide poisoning, postpartum state, and pustular psoriasis.

sources, including clinical studies and postmarketing adverse event 
reporting. There were no events of sickle cell crisis in pegfilgrastim placebo 
controlled clinical studies. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with sickle cell disease are at risk for sickle cell crisis. Factors such 
as infections, dehydration, low oxygen tension, acidosis, extreme physical 
exercise, physical or psychologic stress, alcohol, pregnancy, cold weather, 
and concomitant medical conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus, 
herpes) have been identified as the cause of sickle cell crisis. 
Risk minimization measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 and 4.8 
•  PL Section 2 
Additional risk minimization measures: 
•  None 
Important Identified risk: Glomerulonephritis 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Data to evaluate the safety concerns are derived from available data sources, 
the medicine 
including clinical studies, postmarketing adverse event reporting and from the 
literature. There were no events of glomerulonephritis (GN) in pegfilgrastim 
placebo controlled clinical studies 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Other than the cancer itself, no specific risk factors were identified for this 
patient population. 
Risk minimization measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 and 4.8 
•  PL Section 2 and 4 
Additional risk minimization measures: 
•  None 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Important Identified risk: Acute respiratory distress syndrome 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Data to evaluate the safety concerns are derived from available data sources, 
the medicine 
including clinical studies and postmarketing adverse event reporting. The 
placebo-controlled clinical study data show a higher rate of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome in subjects receiving pegfilgrastim compared to subjects 
receiving placebo. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk factors include concurrent chemotherapy and infections. A number of 
studies have showed that elevated risk of interstitial pneumonia is associated 
with use of rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Interstitial 
pneumonitis and other interstitial lung diseases have been seen with other 
chemotherapy agents in the setting of lung cancer, particularly in Japan. 
Risk minimization measures

Important potential risk: Cytokine release syndrome 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Data to evaluate the safety concerns are derived from available data sources, 
the medicine 
including clinical studies and postmarketing adverse event reporting. There 
were no events of cytokine release syndrome in pegfilgrastim placebo 
controlled clinical studies. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients receiving bi-specific antibodies and T cells engineered to express anti-
CD19 chimeric antigen receptor are at particularly high risk for cytokine release 
syndrome. The severity of the cytokine release syndrome mediating infusion 
reaction might be related to the number of circulating lymphocytes. Among 
patients with B-cell malignancies, risk factors for developing cytokine release 
syndrome included higher bone marrow tumor burden, higher chimeric antigen 
receptor T-cell (CAR-T) cell dose, bulk CD8+ T-cell selection, lymphodepletion 
using fludarabine/ cyclophosphamide, and presence of thrombocytopenia 
before lymphodepletion.

sources, including clinical studies and postmarketing adverse event 
reporting. There were no events of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in pegfilgrastim placebo controlled clinical 
studies.

Patients receiving bi-specific antibodies and T cells engineered to express 
anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor are at particularly high risk for cytokine 
release syndrome. The severity of the cytokine release syndrome mediating

presence of thrombocytopenia before lymphodepletion. 
Chemotherapy only and radiotherapy and chemotherapy increase the risk of 
AML/MDS among elderly women diagnosed with breast cancer. 
AML 
Increased risk of AML has been reported among relatives of patients with 
leukemia; patients receiving alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors; 
and exposure to environmental risk factors including radiation, benzene, 
pesticides, smoking, diagnostic radiology, chloramphenicol, and viruses. 
MDS 
Risk factors for MDS include first degree relatives with history of MDS, 
aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, ionizing radiation, 
alkylating agents, halogenated organics, copper, arc welding fumes, exhaust 
gases, pesticides, smoking, hair dye, benzene, and polyaromatic 
hydrocarbons in air pollution.

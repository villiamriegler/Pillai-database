1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Aimmune Therapeutics Netherlands submitted on 27 June 2019 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Palforzia, through the centralised 
procedure under Article 3(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 14 September 2017. The applicant was changed 
during the procedure to Aimmune Therapeutics Ireland Limited.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Palforzia is indicated as oral immunotherapy (OIT) for patients aged 4 to 17 years with a confirmed 
diagnosis of peanut allergy to reduce the incidence and severity of allergic reactions, including 
anaphylaxis, after exposure to peanut. Palforzia is also indicated for maintenance of efficacy in peanut-
allergic patients who turn 18 years during therapy. 
Palforzia should be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet. 
Palforzia is not intended for, and does not provide, immediate relief of allergic symptoms. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0114/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen 
(peanuts) contained in the above medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance in 
comparison to other products containing Arachis hypogaea allergens previously authorised in the 
European Union as peanut allergens prick test as the applicant claimed that defatted powder of Arachis

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Peanut allergy is a food-related allergic reaction which tends to begin early in life and progresses to a 
symptomatic allergy with increasing age. The allergic reaction provoked by peanuts is an 
immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction. It is a potentially serious condition 
that disproportionately affects children and is associated with severe allergic reactions, including life-
threatening anaphylaxis and death.  
Assessment report  
Page 8/9 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, prevention 
In Europe, the prevalence of peanut allergy in children is approximately 1.6% as estimated by food 
challenges or clinical history1.  
Unlike many other types of food allergies, peanut allergy is usually life-long, with approximately up to 
80% of affected individuals remaining peanut-allergic into adulthood2.  
Peanut and tree nut allergies account for the majority of fatal food-induced anaphylaxis 3.  
Multiple factors can influence the severity of an allergic reaction, including a history of anaphylaxis to 
peanut, comorbid conditions (e.g. asthma, cardiovascular disease, mastocytosis), concurrent use of 
certain medications (e.g. nonselective beta blockers and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
[NSAIDs]), and exercise. Risk-taking behavior in teenagers and young adults, such as failure to avoid 
triggers, failure to carry an epinephrine auto-injector, and alcohol use are thought to contribute to 
severe or fatal anaphylaxis4. However, the severity of an allergic reaction after food allergen exposure 
is not predictable based on any prior reactions or any specific diagnostic marker5. 
Currently, the prevention of a peanut-allergic reaction for individual allergic to peanut is a strict 
peanut-avoidant diet. 
2.1.3.   Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Peanut allergy is classified as an IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction upon allergen (peanut) 
contact. On first exposure, the immune system reacts to proteins in the peanuts by producing the 
antibody IgE which binds to receptors present on mast cells and basophils. Subsequent exposure to 
peanut leads to an inflammatory response governed by these cells, as the peanut protein causes the 
IgE/receptor complexes to cross link and active the release of the inflammatory mediators (e.g. 
histamine) inside them. Histamine and other inflammatory mediators then trigger the symptoms of an 
allergic reaction. 
Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) is an approach, where increasing amounts of an allergen are 
administered to patients with IgE-mediated (food) allergy to raise the threshold and decrease the 
severity of allergic responses to the allergenic agents. An oral route of administration of (especially 
food) allergens like peanut for allergen immunotherapy is called Oral specific ImmunoTherapy (OIT). 
Genetic and environmental factors are involved within the pathogenesis of food allergies. An impaired 
barrier function of the skin is one area of focus. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Clinical features of food allergy may present with a heterogeneous pattern of clinical symptoms. The 
majority of food induced allergic reactions are IgE-mediated (immediate type, type I hypersensitivity). 
IgE-mediated allergic reactions may affect every organ system (e.g. skin: flares, urticarial, worsening 
of atopic dermatitis; gastrointestinal: vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain; respiratory tract: dyspnoea,

wheezing, stridor, cough or rhino conjunctivitis; cardiovascular: system hypotension, 
tachycardia/arrhythmia or cardio-vascular arrest). In addition to objective symptoms, subjective 
symptoms may be heard to measure, such as dizziness, tingling/burning in mouth and throat, itchiness 
of skin, eyes or nose, a general discomfort, dysphagia, nausea and others. 
The diagnosis of peanut allergy is based on a history of allergic reactions to peanut-containing foods, 
presence of peanut-specifics-IgE or reaction to peanut allergens on a skin prick test (SPT), a double-
blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), or a combination of these.    
During the oral food challenge, sequential increasing measured doses of a test allergen are 
administered until symptoms occur that prevent further dosing, allowing the assessment of both the 
highest tolerated dose of an allergen and the associated dose-limiting symptoms.   
Peanut allergy is the leading cause of severe and life-threatening anaphylactic reactions and death 
from food allergic reactions6.  
Unlike other childhood allergen reactivity (like milk or egg), peanut allergy does not always resolve 
with increasing age. Some studies have reported that approximately 20% of children diagnosed with 
peanut allergy outgrow it 7,8,9. Another study confirmed peanut allergy by food challenge in patients 
aged 1 year and reported resolution of peanut allergy in 22% of patients by age 4 years10. In patients 
who become tolerant to peanut, resolution of peanut allergy usually occurs by age 6 years and at a 
much lower frequency after age 10 years11. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently, no licensed therapeutic options are available within the EU for desensitising individuals with 
peanut allergy to peanut allergens. The current global standard of care for patients with peanut allergy 
is peanut avoidance and treatment for allergic reactions due to peanut exposure (adrenaline).  
Strict peanut-avoidant diet can be difficult and imposes a significant quality-of-life burden12. Despite 
efforts of strict peanut avoidance, exposure remains a major concern because allergic responses in 
individuals with peanut allergy may be triggered by minute quantities (< 5 mg) of peanut protein13 . 
Strict adherence to an avoidance diet can be complicated by difficulty in interpreting food labels14 , the 
presence of undeclared or hidden allergens in commercially prepared foods15,16, and inattention to or 
mistrust of food warning labels17. Foods prepared outside the home (e.g. at school, day care centres, 
restaurants, homes of family/friends) present additional potential sources of exposure.

Food allergen exposures are common, with 55% of individuals with peanut allergy experiencing at least 
1 allergic reaction over approximately 5 years18. Peanut allergy can negatively affect the health-related 
quality of life for individuals and their families due to increased stress and anxiety associated with the 
burden of avoidance, constant vigilance over food choices, and resulting social restrictions and fear of 
anaphylaxis 19,20,21,22. 
Patients and their families are educated to recognise and manage allergy symptoms and on the 
appropriate use of rescue medications (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline] auto-injectors) for allergic 
reactions in the event of exposure. Prompt treatment with intramuscular epinephrine is the first-line 
treatment for severe systemic allergic reactions23. However, not all patients may have ready access to 
an epinephrine auto-injector. In addition inadequate use, may delay treatment and result in adverse 
outcomes including hospitalisation and in rare cases, death24 . 
About the product 
Palforzia (defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts)) has been developed as an OIT to 
help protect patients with peanut allergy from severe systemic allergic reactions by ultimately 
modifying the patient’s immunologic response to peanut. The active substance defatted powder of 
Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts) is sourced from raw shelled peanuts that are processed into 
food-grade, light roast, defatted peanut flour. The active substance contains approximately 50% 
peanut protein (w/w) constituting of a natural mixture of a variety of proteins termed Ara h 1 through 
Ara h 17. Of the allergenic proteins, Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 6 are considered the most clinically 
important allergens (immunodominant). The remaining components include primarily fats, 
carbohydrates, minerals, and moisture. The precise mechanism by which OIT desensitises peanut-
allergic patients is not fully characterised. Immunologic changes with OIT in clinical trials suggest 
progression towards a clinical state of desensitisation with with continued peanut OIT. These changes 
include increases in peanut-specific IgG4, decreases in peanut-specific IgE, decreases in the peanut-
specific IgE/IgG4 ratio, increases in peanut-specific regulatory T cell populations, and elimination of 
peanut-specific Th2A cells. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Palforzia is indicated as oral immunotherapy (OIT) for patients aged 4 to 17 years with a confirmed 
diagnosis of peanut allergy to reduce the incidence and severity of allergic reactions, including 
anaphylaxis, after exposure to peanut. Palforzia is also indicated for maintenance of efficacy in peanut-
allergic patients who turn 18 years during therapy. 
Palforzia should be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet. 
Palforzia is not intended for, and does not provide, immediate relief of allergic symptoms.

A PIP was agreed by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) on 2 October 2015 for the condition ‘Treatment 
of peanut allergy’ in children from 1 to less than 18 years of age. A waiver for children below 1 year of 
age was granted by the PDCO; a study in children from 1 to less than 4 years of age was ongoing 
(ARC005) at time of submission.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as oral powder in sachets, or capsules for opening; sachets contain 
300 mg and capsules for opening contain 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg or 100 mg of defatted powder 
of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: partially pregelatinised maize starch (only 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg  
strengths), microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate. 
The product is available in either color-coded hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) capsules 
containing 0.5, 1, 10, 20 or 100 mg of the active substance packaged in PVC: PCTFE/Aluminium 
blisters (blister strips for initial dose escalation (IDE) and daily dose packs as well as individual blisters 
for physician in-clinic use) or PET/Aluminium/mLLDPE foil-laminate sachets containing 300 mg of the 
active substance. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance, defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts) is a complex natural 
product and consequently an International Nonproprietary Name (INN) of the active substance cannot 
be assigned (INNs are selected in principle only for single, well-defined substances that can be 
unequivocally characterised by a chemical name or formula). Therefore, a common name of the active 
substance is used. 
Assessment report  
Page 12/13 
 
 
  
 
The active substance is a partially defatted peanut flour, a light brown to beige fine powder, which 
represents a natural mixture of allergens (a variety of proteins including proteins termed Ara h 1 
through Ara h 17, which have been identified to confer the allergenic properties of peanuts. These 
allergens vary in their patient sensitivity, abundance, physicochemical properties, and consequently 
clinical relevance. The most clinically important allergens (Ara h 2, Ara h 6, and to a lesser extent, Ara 
h 1) are controlled within the active substance specifications. 
In addition to routine control of Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 6, the presence and consistency of other 
allergens that also have been demonstrated to bind IgE (Ara h 3, Ara h 7, Ara h 8, Ara h 9, and Ara h 
10 through Ara h 17) have been characterised to different extents in lots of the active. Relative to Ara 
h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 6, allergens Ara h 3, Ara h 7, Ara h 8, Ara h 9, and Ara h 10 through Ara h 17 
have been reported to have lesser clinical importance as discussed above. All 17 known peanut 
allergens have demonstrated some prevalence of IgE binding; therefore, pertinent additional 
information about each Ara h 1 through Ara h 17 is included in the dossier and appropriately discussed. 
Solubility, partition coefficient, melting point, pH, and other physicochemical properties are not directly 
applicable to the active substance due to its heterogenous nature. In addition to the peanut allergens, 
the active substance contains proteins not known to be allergenic, carbohydrates, fats, and minerals 
naturally found in peanut, each of which possess different physicochemical properties. 
Primary structural information from the World Health Organization and International Union of 
Immunological Societies (WHO/IUIS) for allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 6 which are tested per 
established specifications are included in Table 1.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured commercially from raw shelled peanuts following food GMP at 
the Golden Peanut Company, USA (GPTN). The active substance manufacturing process has been 
adequately described. 
For manufacture of the active substance, the raw shelled peanuts are first roasted, deskinned and 
grinded before they are defatted in a hydraulic press and milled. Manufacture of the source material is 
performed according to food GMP. Active substance release testing activities are performed following 
pharmaceutical GMP standards. Selection of active substance batches follows a decision flowsheet 
which is mainly based on alignment of the GPTN certificate of analysis with the active substance 
specification. The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable and in-process 
controls are adequately set to control the process. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. The selection of starting material is sufficiently justified with literature data which show that 
these peanuts are commonly consumed in Western countries and that the peanuts are highly 
comparable in their allergenicity attributes. 
No human or animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
Page 14/15 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The critical limits and in-process controls for the manufacturing process have been established to 
ensure the suitability of source material.  
Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the 
active substance manufacturing process. 
Process validation 
Full data on process validation of the manufacturing process of the peanut flour from raw shelled 
peanuts are not provided.  
To address the request for an appropriately controlled process, especially with respect to 
manufacturing steps which might have an impact on the relative potencies of relevant allergens, the 
applicant includes selection criterion for batches which may be screened for use as the active 
substance. Considering the nature of the active substance and its intended use, this approach was 
considered satisfactory. 
Manufacturing process development 
The active substance used in clinical batches was manufactured at the same manufacturer as those 
intended for commercial use. 
Only minor changes to the source material manufacturing process at GPTN have been implemented 
over the course of clinical development of Palforzia, in order to improve the protection of the active 
substance during the manufacturing process and/or to increase plant capacity. These changes have 
been sufficiently justified. 
Characterisation 
In line with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. monograph 1063 “Allergen Products”, it was 
demonstrated by combination of electrophoretic and immune methods that the relevant allergens Ara h 
1, 2 and 6 are present in the active substance and finished product batches. The active substance is 
characterised by general protein profiling (SDS-PAGE, LC-MS-MS) and allergen characterisation 
techniques (immunoblotting, ELISA) including data on extractability studies. Potential impurities like 
pesticides, elemental impurities and aflatoxins relate to the production and storage of peanuts and are 
appropriately controlled. 
Specification 
The active substance specifications include appropriate tests and acceptance criteria for this type of 
product: appearance (visual), identification (HPLC), protein integrity (HPLC), relative potency (ELISA), 
total allergenic activity (ELISA), assay (total protein) (combustion), loss on drying (gravimetric), 
particle size distribution (laser diffraction), microbiological limits (Ph. Eur.), specified organisms (Ph. 
Eur.), aflatoxin (UPLC) and elemental impurities (ICP-MS). 
The active substance release testing follows pharmaceutical GMP and includes controls for aflatoxin and 
pesticide content which have been found to be acceptable. 
The tests and assays as indicated in the monograph “Allergen Products” (01/2019:1063) and section 
“5.1.4. Microbiological quality of non-sterile pharmaceutical preparations and substances for 
pharmaceutical use” (01/2014:50104) of the Ph. Eur. including assays for total allergenic activity, 
relevant allergens, protein profile and protein content are performed for release testing of the active 
substance. Moreover, testing for heavy metals, pesticides and loss on drying which are tests required 
for herbal drugs according to the monograph “Herbal Drugs” (01/2017:1433) are included. 
Assessment report  
Page 15/16 
 
 
  
 
Apart from the tests and assays listed in the monographs 1063, 1433 and section 50104 of the Ph. 
Eur., the following tests are included: appearance, protein integrity via HPLC as well as particle size 
distribution. Tests and acceptance criteria established are generally considered adequate.  
Potency testing of the active substance, the finished product, as well as the in-house reference 
preparation (IHRP) at release and for demonstration of stability fulfils the requirements of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph 1063 “Allergen Products” in combination with the EMA Guideline on allergen products: 
production and quality issues (EMEA/CHMP/BWP/304831/2007).  
Since the protein content of a respective active substance batch may vary within the established 
acceptance criteria, relative potencies are narrowed as such that the variability of the protein content 
per mg active substance is incorporated into the respective acceptance criteria to comply with Ph. Eur. 
1063.  
The selection of elemental impurities to test in the active substance and corresponding limits were 
established in conformance with ICH Q3D, Elemental Impurities. However, herbal products or allergen 
extracts are out of the scope of this guideline. Thus, the limit for mercury (Hg) will be adapted to 
comply with Ph. Eur. 1433 prior to commercial testing.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. It is adequately demonstrated that the 
analytical procedures are suitable for their respective purposes. The applicant committed to performing 
additional validation studies to further support the relative potency ELISA method across the proposed 
specification according to ICH guidance Q2(R1) and to submit these data by Q1/2021. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for commercial scale batches are provided, of these, several batches were tested 
for relative potencies. All results comply with the specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
An active substance batch is used as internal reference standard since official standards are not 
available. The same IHRP is used for the active substance and finished product testing. A qualified 
secondary reference standard will be used in commercial routine testing of the active substance and 
finished product. The applicant commits to include testing of total allergenic activity in the annual 
stability program (REC3). The applicant commitment to develop acceptance criteria for the human 
serum pool once more data will have been collected is accepted (REC6). 
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
shelf life of 24 months in the proposed container. 
Real time, real condition stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the 
commercial manufacturing process stored at 2 to 8°C RH in the representative container for 36 months 
and for up to 36 months under accelerated conditions at or 25°C / 60%  according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
Results on stress conditions (treatment by acid, base, peroxide, heat, light) were also provided on one 
batch. Changes in relative potency and protein integrity were observed in the active substance 
stressed by acid, base, or peroxide treatment. These 3 stress conditions (treatment by acid, base, and 
peroxide) are extreme, thus changes in the product are not unexpected under regular storage

conditions. The forced degradation studies show that the 2 main stability indicating methods (the 
relative potency ELISA and protein integrity by HPLC) are capable of detecting degradation of the 
active substance. The product was stable under the heat and light (photostability) stress conditions. 
The studies are performed in line with ICH Q1A and ICH Q5C as well as EMA-guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/BWP/304831/2007. Based on the commitment provided by the applicant to demonstrate 
correlation between total allergenic activity and relative potencies of relevant allergens and to include 
testing of total allergenic activity in on-going and annual stability studies, the claimed shelf life of 24 
months can be granted. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is sachets or hard hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) capsules for opening 
containing peanut protein as defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts), in a dry-blend 
mixture of the active substance with excipients and is intended for oral immunotherapy. In order to 
supply adequate doses for a complex up-dosing scheme, Palforzia is presented as 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 10 
mg, 20 mg, 100 mg and 300 mg peanut protein individual dosage strengths. In order to facilitate the 
dosing scheme (SmPC 4.2), the finished product is packaged in combinations of individual dosage 
strengths in several packaging configurations. The finished product packaging configuration includes an 
initial dose escalation (IDE) blister, individual blister (or sachet) cartons at each dose level for 
physician in-clinic up-dosing, a daily dose pack at each dose level for in-home up-dosing, and a carton 
of sachets for maintenance. 
For Palforzia, the biological activity correlates with the protein content. Therefore, indicating the 
strength in mass of peanut protein is in line with the requirements of the EMA allergen guideline. This 
point is discussed further in the report. 
In addition to the active substance, the finished product in capsules (0.5 mg, 1 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg  
is formulated with the following excipients:  partially pregelatinised maize starch (NF/Ph Eur; diluent), 
microcrystalline cellulose (NF/Ph Eur; diluent), colloidal silicon dioxide (NF/Ph Eur; glidant), 
magnesium stearate (NF/Ph Eur; lubricant). 
In addition to the active substance, the finished product in capsules (100mg) and sachets is formulated 
with the following excipients: microcrystalline cellulose (NF/Ph Eur; diluent), colloidal silicon dioxide 
(NF/Ph Eur; glidant), magnesium stearate (NF/Ph Eur; lubricant). 
A dry powder formulation was developed based on the proposed oral route of administration and the 
need for the product to be mixed evenly with semi-solid food. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
Binary compatibility studies were performed at 40°C / 75% RH over 2 months to assess the 
compatibility of each excipient independently with the active substance, giving satisfactory results. 
The general process for manufacture of Palforzia has not changed from phase 2 to phase 3 clinical 
trials and from phase 3 to commercial production. In each transition, the powder blend batch size 
increased to accommodate the clinical or commercial demand. The equipment used to accommodate 
this increase in batch size is of the same design and operating principle. 
Data provided on process development are appropriate to support the manufacturing process, process 
parameters as well as in-process controls and controls of critical steps. 
Assessment report  
Page 17/18 
 
 
  
 
Changes in equipment, manufacturing scale and production area were introduced between 
manufacture of clinical phase 3 and commercial batches. Comparability exercise was performed and 
demonstrated comparability of clinical and commercial batches. 
The product is available in either colour-coded hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) capsules 
containing 0.5, 1, 10, 20 or 100 mg of the active substance packaged in PVC:PCTFE/Aluminium blisters 
(blister strips for initial dose escalation (IDE) and daily dose packs) or PET/Aluminium/mLLDPE foil-
laminate sachets containing 300 mg of the active substance. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and 
EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the finished product involves powder blending, bulk finished product 
encapsulation (0.5, 1, 10, 20, and 100 mg strengths) or sachet filling (300 mg strength only), and 
packaging (primary and secondary), as applicable. 
Information on the storage containers used and potential holding times established for intermediates 
during manufacture of the finished product are included. Blend bulk and encapsulated bulk hold times 
are sufficiently justified by suitable stability data. 
Relevant process parameters are included with set points or ranges justified by pharmaceutical 
development data included in the dossier. Based on the risks identified during development, critical 
steps have been identified and adequate controls of critical steps to monitor the critical material 
attributes and critical process parameters are included. 
Prospective process validation was performed. The justification provided for the approach is 
comprehensible and the set-up is considered suitable to demonstrate adequate validity of the finished 
product manufacturing process for all strengths. Three consecutively manufactured batches of the 0.5, 
20, 100 or 300 mg strength were included in validation of each process step, i.e. blending and 
encapsulation or sachet filling in line with EMA-guideline “Guideline on process validation for finished 
products - information and data to be provided in regulatory submissions” 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1,Corr.1). Batches were manufactured at the target 
batch size (commercial scale). The blistering process was validated separately. Results of process 
parameters and of extended testing as well as release data are included for all PPQ batches. All results 
met the pre-defined acceptance criteria. Therefore, the conclusion of the applicant that the process is 
considered adequately validated and suitable for manufacture of the finished product can be followed. 
Results of shipping validation studies will be available by the second quarter of 2020. 
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include typical tests for this type of the finished product: 
appearance (visual), identification (HPLC), protein integrity (HPLC), relative potency (ELISA), total 
allergenic activity (ELISA), assay (total protein) (combustion), loss on drying (gravimetric), deliverable 
mass (gravimetric),content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), microbiological limits (Ph. Eur.), specified organisms 
(Ph. Eur.) and aflatoxin (UPLC). 
Since potency is reported based on the protein content at the active substance level, which is 
considered acceptable, and since the strength of the product is adjusted based on the protein content, 
it is assured that each mg of peanut protein has a controlled potency. 
All presentations of AR101 finished product capsules are packaged into thermoformed blister strips 
with foil-backing (pharmaceutical-grade PCTFE (polychlortrifluorethylen) film lamination). Push-through 
(for IDE and daily dose packs) lidding materials are used. Sachets are made from a 3 layer foil-
laminate film. The foil-laminate is composed of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/aluminium 
Assessment report  
Page 18/19 
 
 
  
 
foil/polyethylene (mPE). Paperboard cartons are used as secondary packaging. The information 
provided on the container closure system is sufficient. All plastic materials used as container closure 
comply with the requirements of Ph. Eur. 3.2.2. 
The applicant commits to evaluate the content uniformity data on a sufficient number of 1 mg drug 
product lots manufactured at commercial scale for setting the acceptance criteria according to Ph Eur 
2.9.40 and also to include 0.5 mg lots for evaluation (REC4). 
Test and acceptance criteria implemented for release testing of the finished product comply with (or 
are stricter than) the requirements of the Ph. Eur. monograph 1063 “Allergen Products”, 1433 “Herbal 
drugs” and 1165 “Powder, oral” and corresponding section 2.9.40 and 5.1.4 of the Ph. Eur. as well as 
with ICH guideline Q6A and Q6B.A commitment is provided to reassess the specifications once batch 
analysis data from  additional commercial batches will be available (REC2). 
According to the Ph. Eur. monograph 1063 “Allergen Products”, a validated test measuring the potency 
should be included in testing of allergen products intended for therapeutic use. This test should be 
performed as late as possible in the manufacturing process. Total allergenic activity will be included for 
release and stability testing of the finished product initially. To reduce the risk of doses differing in 
allergenic content, after introduction of a new dose in the clinic, each patient receives subsequent 
doses for application at home from the same finished product batch which was used for up-dosing in 
the clinic until the maintenance dose of 300 mg is reached. If a combination of different strengths is 
applied, each strength which is taken at home will be derived from the same batch of a respective 
strength which was used for up-dosing in the clinic. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The information on the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine was performed in accordance with the 
document “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion 
for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020. The risk of nitrosamine or its precursors being present in the 
finished product is rated as being extremely low. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Reference materials 
The same reference standard, made from a lot of the active substance, is used for both active 
substance and finished product assays. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data on commercial scale batches of the finished product were provided. The data 
provided are generally considered sufficient to demonstrate adequate batch-to-batch consistency of 
the different finished product strength. The results confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Stability of the product 
Real time/real condition stability data of pilot scale batches of finished product covering all strengths 
for up to 36 months stored at 2 to 8°C and for up to 36 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. Taking into account that the finished product is a dry powder blend, the 
Assessment report  
Page 19/20 
 
 
  
 
bracketing approach described by the applicant is considered acceptable. The batches of the medicinal 
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing. 
In addition, commercial scale batches covering all strengths by a matrix design stored at 25°C /60% 
RH or 30°C / 65% RH over 12 months and at 40°C / 75% over 6 months were provided. These studies 
are still ongoing. Moreover, supportive stability data provided for phase 3 clinical batches stored over 
36 months and data provided from degradation studies were included. Thus, since comparability 
between clinical phase 3 and commercial scale batches was sufficiently demonstrated, a shelf life for 
the finished product of 24 months can be granted. All results complied with the acceptance criteria in 
current specifications.  
Total allergenic activity will be included in the on-going and new stability studies until a correlation 
between relative potency/-ies of single allergens and total allergenic activity have been demonstrated 
(REC3). 
Data collected from forced degradation studies indicate that Palforzia was stable under heat and light 
stressed conditions. The analytical data from heat, light, acid, base, and oxidation stress conditions 
support the stability indicating nature of the methods. 
Data collected from a temperature cycling study indicate that Palforzia was stable even after multiple 
temperature cycling between -20°C and 40°C. The two temperatures that the finished product was 
cycled between, represent the possible extreme conditions that finished product might be exposed to 
during shipping or during usage by a patient.  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 2 years and storage conditions: the product should 
not be stored above 25°C, as stated in the SmPC, are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
All materials used in the manufacture of the finished product are either plant-based or inorganic 
materials. None of the materials in the finished product contain products of animal origin or animal-
derived products. The lubricant (stearate) used in the manufacture of the sachet foil laminate material, 
which is in direct contact with the finished product, is derived from the tallow of ovine, bovine, and 
caprine sources. However, given the processing conditions used during the manufacturing of the tallow 
derivatives, there is no concern regarding these materials with respect to either virus or TSE safety. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The active substance used in production of Palforzia is a partially defatted lightly roasted peanut flour.  
It is manufactured from semen of Arachis hypogaea by the Golden Peanut Company, USA according to 
food GMP. Active substance release testing follows pharmaceutical GMP. The finished product is a dry-
blend mixture of the active substance with Ph. Eur. grade excipients and is intended for oral 
immunotherapy presented in capsules for opening containing 0.5, 1, 10, 20, or 100 mg peanut protein, 
or in sachets containing 300 mg peanut protein.  
The active substance is manufactured according to standards for conventional food use. While some 
requirements of the EU-GMP guideline Annex 2 on Manufacture of Biological active substances and 
Medicinal Products for Human Use are not fully covered, adequate improvements were introduced to 
Assessment report  
Page 20/21 
 
 
  
 
assure that batches which were not produced within narrowed justified ranges will not be used for 
manufacture of Palforzia. 
Potency testing of the active substance, the finished product as well as the in-house reference 
preparation (IHRP) at release and for demonstration of stability is performed in line with the 
requirements of the Ph. Eur. monograph 1063 “Allergen Products” in combination with the EMA 
Guideline on allergen products: production and quality issues. The applicant also included, testing of 
total allergenic activity for finished product release at least until results from validation studies in line 
with ICH Q2 will be provided, which is expected in Q1/2021.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which will be addressed as Recommendations for 
future quality development post marketing. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Palforzia’s active substance (defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts)) is food-grade, 
defatted, roasted peanut flour that contains approximately 50% peanut protein (w/w). Peanut flour 
(containing fats, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals as well as protein) is a standard 
foodstuff, consumed in the diet at levels higher than the intended clinical use.  
Due to the nature of the active substance, a food-derived product, non-clinical studies with Palforzia 
have not been performed. This was discussed and agreed with the PDCO during the development 
program of Palforzia.  
The non-clinical data package submitted by the applicant consists of justifications for not performing in 
vitro/ in vivo studies and literature references. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
In vitro studies 
Peanuts contain multiple Ara h proteins, including Ara h 1 through Ara h 9 that provide specific 
functions within the peanut seed and are thought to have allergenic properties. Based on in vitro 
serology and histamine release assays, Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 6 are believed to be the most 
common and potent peanut allergens, with Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 contributing the majority of the 
allergenic activity of crude peanut extract (Zhuang, 201325; Porterfield, 200926). Therefore, the 
Palforzia active substance, which contains all peanut allergens, was tested for its relative (to a 
reference standard) potency of Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 6 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay. As determined by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, the expression of 
these proteins was consistent, both individually and relative to each other, across numerous lots of 
Palforzia active substance.

In vivo studies 
The applicant presented data from a literature search encompassing non-clinical pharmacology data 
generated in a mouse model of peanut allergy27,28,29,30.  
In these studies, the principal model for induction of peanut allergy in mice was exposure by oral 
gavage to peanut proteins in the form of ground roasted peanuts (Kulis, 2012)27, peanut butter (Sun, 
2007), or purified peanut proteins in combination with cholera toxin (Mondoulet, 2012)29. After 3 to 6 
weekly exposures, the mice were challenged to demonstrate an allergic response. Several in vivo 
respectively para-clinical parameters for desensitisation were introduced (e.g. change in body 
temperature, symptom scores, vascular permeability, mast cell mediator release, detection of allergen 
specific antibodies, cytokine release, or the analysis of various immune cells in detail). 
In the study by Kulis (2012)27, the authors concluded that Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 were responsible for the 
majority of effector activity in this peanut allergy mouse model and immunotherapy with Ara h 2/Ara h 
6 can effectively desensitise the mice to a degree equivalent to crude whole peanut extract containing 
all major allergens. 
In the study by Sun (2007)28, the authors concluded that both antigen-specific IgE and mast cells were 
necessary and sufficient to induce anaphylaxis in peanut protein-allergic mice. 
In the study by Mondoulet (2012)29, epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) reduced the Th2 
immunological response, esophageal eosinophilia, mRNA expression of Th2 in tissue and intestinal 
villus atrophy. Additionally, EPIT increased specific IgG2a and mRNA expression of Foxp3 in the 
esophageal mucosa. 
In the study by Wagenaar (2019)30, the mice showed a reduction in the drop in body temperature (i.e., 
symptoms of anaphylactic shock) and increase in IgG2a levels in response to peanut extract 
challenges. Similarly, no anaphylaxis was seen in BALB/c mice and a clear effect of OIT was observed 
on Th2-linked antibody and cytokine responses. Specific antibody responses showed similar patterns in 
both strains for IgA and IgG1. 
The applicant noted that there are inherent limitations of the animal models such as induction of the 
food allergy requiring co-administration with cholera toxin, and intraperitoneal/intradermal rather than 
oral challenge. Effector responses and anaphylaxis intensity may vary depending on whether the 
challenge is oral or systemic (such as intraperitoneal) (Joost, 2011)31.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, pharmacodynamics drug interaction 
studies 
The applicant stated that Palforzia’s substance contains components of partially defatted, roasted 
peanut flour which are standard human dietary constituents consumed in the diet at levels higher than 
the intended clinical use. Therefore, secondary pharmacodynamics investigations, safety pharmacology 
and pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies have not been performed.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the components of the peanut flour active 
substance will follow normal human dietary component PK/metabolic pathways, as expected from a 
foodstuff containing proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins and minerals. After oral 
administration, the proteins are hydrolysed to amino acids and small polypeptides in the lumen of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, no pharmacokinetics studies have been conducted. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Preclinical toxicity studies, including juvenile toxicity studies, with Palforzia have not been performed 
as the safety of peanut flour as a common food and food additive is assured.  
However, in contrast to peanut flour as foodstuff, some excipients are contained in the Palforzia 
formulation. The finished product is formulated with starch 1500 (partially pregelatinised maize 
starch), microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate as excipients. All 
the excipients used are widely used and of Ph Eur compendial grade and considered to be safe and 
appropriate for use in pharmaceutical products for both children and adults. There are no novel 
excipients in the Palforzia formulations, and no safety issues presented by the excipients. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance (derived from food), the use of which will not alter the 
concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, Palforzia is not expected 
to pose any risk to the environment. Dedicated ERA studies are not considered necessary and the 
submitted expert statement is acceptable.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The in vivo pharmacology data in a mouse model of peanut allergy, presented from the literature, 
provided information on involved immunological players or pathophysiological changes within peanut 
allergy and immunological and clinical effects of desensitisation. Nevertheless, the value of in vivo 
(mouse) models of human food allergy is still limited. Therefore, robust conclusions on the 
pharmacodynamic effects of peanut OIT in human cannot easily be transferred from the mouse model. 
No pharmacokinetics studies have been performed. The applicant has briefly justified the absence of 
data, which is agreed due to the nature of the product being mainly proteins which are rapidly 
metabolised to peptides and amino acids not detectable in body fluids. 
It is agreed that non-clinical safety studies are not regarded necessary as peanuts are commonly used 
foods and food additives. Peanut flour is an ingredient in many food products, regarding the product in 
question Palforzia it is dosed in relatively small quantities (up to 300 mg daily), and is administered via 
the same route as orally ingested, peanut-containing products. It is also acknowledged that the 
excipients are well-known and not suspected to harbour any toxic properties. Impurities with known 
toxic or carcinogenic effects as aflatoxins, heavy metals and pesticides are controlled by the 
specifications, which are aligned with European and U.S. requirements for foodstuff.   
Furthermore, it is agreed that a specific juvenile animal study is not considered needed in view of 
existing clinical experience in children with peanut OIT as well as the limited value of mouse models of 
human food allergy.  
Assessment report  
Page 24/25 
 
 
  
 
Finally, clinical studies performed with Palforzia did not identify any unexpected safety signal and the 
adverse event profile complies with known side effects of OIT.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The absence of a non-clinical development for Palforzia is acceptable in view of the nature of the active 
substance and the use of well-known excipients with no potential for toxicity. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development program was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Palforzia in 
children and adolescents with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut allergy in reducing the incidence and 
severity of allergic reactions after exposure to peanut, in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet. 
Two phase II studies (ARC001, ARC002) and 7 phase III studies (ARC003, ARC004, ARC005, ARC007, 
ARC008, ARC010, ARC011) were conducted. The main pivotal efficacy and safety studies are ARC003 
(Europe and North America) and ARC010 (Europe only) (Table 2). 
Classical phase I studies in healthy individuals have not been conducted and are not considered 
appropriate for allergen products, since they do not provide helpful information in terms of safety and 
tolerability (CHMP/EWP/18504/2006). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Palforzia is a non-derivated/purified food-derived product which is given orally in small amounts via the 
same route of administration as normal consumption of food (i.e. peanuts). Components of peanut 
flour are in general standard human dietary constituents. 
Palforzia’s active substance (defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts)) is sourced 
from raw shelled peanuts that are processed into food-grade, light roast, defatted peanut flour. The 
active substance contains approximately 50% peanut protein (w/w) (proteins Ara h 1 to Ara h 17). The 
remaining components include primarily fats, carbohydrates, minerals, and moisture. Therefore, the 
active ingredients of Palforzia contain naturally occurring allergenic peanut proteins, which are 
underlying the physiologic digestion. After oral administration, the proteins are hydrolysed to amino 
acids and small polypeptides in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Assessment report  
Page 27/28 
 
 
  
 
In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Clinical Development of Products for Specific 
Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Allergic Disease (CHMP/EWP/18504/2006), no clinical studies 
investigating the pharmacokinetic profile and metabolism of Palforzia have been conducted.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
In general, peanut allergy may be classified as an IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction upon 
allergen (peanut) contact. In such reactions, peanut-specific IgE antibodies are thought to bind to 
high-affinity receptors on mast cells and basophils. Allergen- SIT is an approach, where increasing 
amounts of an allergen are administered to patients with IgE-mediated (food) allergy to raise the 
threshold and decrease the severity of allergic responses to the allergenic agents. An oral route of 
administration of (especially food) allergens like peanut for allergen immunotherapy is called OIT. 
The mechanism by which OIT desensitises peanut-allergic patients has not been definitely 
characterised.  However, described immunologic changes in line with a “successful” desensitization 
upon OIT (or SIT), include increases in allergen-specific IgG4, decreases in allergen-specific IgE, 
decreases in the allergen-specific IgE/IgG4 ratio, increases in allergen-specific regulatory T cell 
populations, and others. 
The described general mode of action including presented data on correspondent trials within the 
applicant’s development program goes in line with current hypothesis of specific immunomodulatory 
responses in SIT respectively OIT.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Clinical Development of Products for Specific 
Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Allergic Disease (CHMP/EWP/18504/2006), no formal 
pharmacodynamics studies were conducted with Palforzia. Data on the immunologic changes (i.e. 
peanut-specific IgE and IgG4) were measured in efficacy/safety clinical trials performed with Palforzia.  
Thus, changes of immunoglobulins and changes of wheal-size following SPT are presented in the 
efficacy part of the dossier (please refer to ancillary efficacy results for assessment). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Palforzia contain naturally occurring allergenic peanut proteins (proteins Ara h 1 to Ara h 17). After 
oral administration, the proteins are hydrolysed to amino acids and small polypeptides in the lumen of 
the gastrointestinal tract. 
Peanut allergy may be classified as an IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction upon peanut 
contact. The precise mechanism of action of desensitisation is not fully understood. However, described 
immunologic changes in line with a “successful” desensitization upon OIT (or SIT), include increases in 
allergen-specific IgG4, decreases in allergen-specific IgE, decreases in the allergen-specific IgE/IgG4 
ratio, increases in allergen-specific regulatory T cell populations, and others. The described general 
mode of action including presented data on correspondent trials within the applicant’s development 
program go in line with current hypothesis of specific immunomodulatory responses in SIT respectively 
OIT. 
Pharmacokinetic studies are not possible for products of specific immunotherapy. During specific 
immunotherapy usually plasma concentrations of the active substance are not measurable, due to the 
Assessment report  
Page 28/29 
 
 
  
 
nature of the product (CHMP/EWP/18504/2006). In addition, systemic levels of Palforzia are not 
relevant for the process of OIT, which depends in part on oral delivery and presentation to the immune 
system associated with draining gut-associated lymphoid tissue. 
Formal pharmacodynamic studies are also not possible for allergen products. However, to show the 
effect of specific immunotherapy on the immune system immunological changes (e.g. changes in 
allergen-specific IgG levels, T-cell responses, and/or cytokine production) and/or modifications of the 
endorgan specific response (e.g. provocation tests) should be measured (CHMP/EWP/18504/2006). 
Therefore, changes of immunoglobulin levels and changes of wheal-size following SPT are presented in 
the efficacy part of the dossier.  
Therefore, for the clinical development of Palforzia, no formal pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted. This is in line with the CHMP Guideline on the Clinical 
Development of Products for Specific Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Allergic Disease 
(CHMP/EWP/18504/2006) and agreed by CHMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
Due to the nature of the active substance and the intended use of Palforzia, the absence of 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies is acceptable and in line with the CHMP guideline 
(CHMP/EWP/18504/2006). The effect of specific immunotherapy on the immune system immunological 
changes have been measured in the clinical efficacy/safety studies. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Palforzia clinical development program in children, adolescents, and adults with peanut allergy included  
- 
- 
2 phase 2 studies (ARC001, ARC002) and  
7 phase 3 studies (ARC003, ARC004, ARC005, ARC007, ARC008, ARC010, ARC011).  
At time of the marketing authorisation application, study conduct was complete for the phase 2 studies 
ARC001 and ARC002; 2 pivotal phase 3 efficacy and safety studies, ARC003 (Europe and North 
America) and ARC010 (Europe only); and the phase 3 safety study ARC007 (North America only). 
During the evaluation, ARC004 study was finalised (14 Feb 2020) and the final study report submitted 
for assessment. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Correspondent to the concept of specific immunotherapy, increasing amounts of peanut allergen were 
administered to peanut allergic patients in order to induce and maintain a state of so-called 
desensitisation to peanut protein. Consequently, the patient is thought to tolerate a higher amount of 
peanut protein without severe symptoms and potentially life-threatening systemic allergic reactions 
resulting from an accidental exposure to nontrivial amounts of peanut. 
Selection and timing of each dose of peanut protein (Palforzia) was based on literature data, including 
the work of the Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR). Stepwise increasing amounts were 
applied during initial-day dose escalation, up-dosing, and maintenance. 
Results from phase 2 studies ARC001 and ARC002 demonstrated that a clinically desensitisation was 
reached after initial dose escalation, up-dosing, and maintenance dosing with Palforzia at 300 mg/day. 
Desensitisation to at least 300 mg peanut protein with daily Palforzia treatment is expected by the 
Assessment report  
Page 29/30 
 
 
  
 
applicant to provide a clinically meaningful level of protection against most accidental exposures to 
peanut. The applicant declared that although the level of exposure to peanut protein in most accidental 
exposures is unknown, most clinically relevant accidental exposures are believed to occur at low levels. 
This expectation is based – among others - on data of the MIRABEL survey, a real-world observational 
study conducted in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg in 785 peanut-allergic patients. Here the real-life 
eliciting dose for allergic reactions due to accidental exposure was estimated to be a median of 125 mg 
peanut protein (range, 34-177 mg)32.  
Based on ARC001 and ARC002 studies, the dosing regimen used in the phase 2 studies was used in the 
pivotal phase 3 studies ARC003 and ARC010. 
In general, this approach (based on literature plus experiences in food allergen OIT studies) is 
accepted. However, it was acknowledged that a “classical dose-finding” for Palforzia has not been 
performed. During the evaluation, CHMP questioned if differences in the timing schedule including a 
more prolonged and slower up-dosing or a prolonged maintenance period, including a lower 
maintenance dose (< 300 mg) might have had the same clinical effect (but probably less side effects). 
The applicant explained that tthe choice of maintenance dose was a balance between achieving 
clinically relevant efficacy and not increasing the dose to levels resulting in an inacceptable frequency 
of adverse events. It was argued that in opposite to lower doses of maintenance (which although was 
not been presented), “Palforzia phase 2 data indicated that the gain in efficacy with a high 
maintenance does (e.g. 1000mg or higher) would not be clinically justified. Lower doses of 
maintenance were not discussed. Instead it was claimed that Palforzia phase 2 data and published 
literature utilising 300mg maintenance (equivalent protein content of approximately 1 peanut kernel), 
supported progressing to the pivotal phase 3 studies with a maintenance dose of 300 mg/day.  
The applicant also made reference to a placebo-controlled peanut OIT study33 in which slower 
up-dosing and lower maintenance doses were used. This small study (62 subjects) suggest that slower 
up-dosing may lead to fewer adverse events leading to study discontinuation, while eventually 
reaching desensitisation. However, the primary endpoint of this study was tolerating at least 300 mg 
peanut protein, not the 1000 mg level (as a single dose) that was required to support the Palforzia 
studies. The applicant concluded that these data were interesting but do not provide robust evidence of 
efficacy and safety for this dosing approach.   
With regard to a non-daily maintenance dosing schedule, the applicant pointed to data from the 
completed follow-on study ARC004, which explored nondaily maintenance dosing regimens. These data 
suggest that non-daily maintenance dosing appears not to be as effective as daily dosing in 
maintaining clinically relevant efficacy and would result in a completely different benefit-risk 
assessment. Thus, the importance of a daily treatment intake was pronounced. 
With regard to modifications of the up-dosing regimen, data from the pivotal studies indicated that 
only a small proportion of Palforzia-treated subjects needed to reduce their dose or stay at the same 
dose level on more than one occasion, and the majority of dose reductions or staying at the same dose 
occurred during the early stages of the up-dosing regimen.  
Appropriate dose modification instructions are included in the product information to give the physician 
to the flexibility to lengthen up-dosing as appropriate for an individual patient per their clinical 
judgment, although no robust data are available to indicate that fewer adverse reactions would result.

The amount of peanut protein per dose was analysed within the quality part. However, the dosing 
regimen is not adjusted according to age, weight or body surface. This might be relevant for efficacy 
but might be neglectable for safety reasons, because the same dose/dose schedule is applied for 
adolescents or children, as the doses are increased individually step by step and a possible allergic 
reaction is monitored carefully.  
The dose is applied over a certain time period and the flour is mixed with different foods. Time interval 
of intake, content of the stomach prior intake, and the food matrix in which the flour is mixed in, and 
other circumstances are known to influence possible allergic reactions.

Study ARC003 - Peanut allergy oral immunotherapy study of Palforzia for 
desensitization in children and adults (PALISADE) 
Methods 
Study design 
ARC003 phase 3, international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of Palforzia in peanut-allergic subjects. The study consisted of screening and 
double-blind treatment periods that included initial dose escalation (2 days), up-dosing (20-40 weeks), 
and maintenance (approximately 24-28 weeks) (Figure 1). 
Figure 1 Study schema (ARC003 and ARC010) 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria (summary of most notable) 
•  Subjects aged 4 to 55 years (inclusive); 
•  Subjects with a clinical history of peanut allergy or peanut-containing foods; 
Assessment report  
Page 31/32 
 
 
  
 
 
•  Subjects with serum IgE to peanut ≥ 0.35 kUA/L and/or a skin prick test to peanut of ≥ 3 mm 
compared with control at the time of screening; 
•  Subjects who dose-limiting symptoms (an allergic reaction with type I hypersensitivity 
symptoms, also called symptoms or allergy symptoms) after consuming a single dose of ≤ 100 
mg peanut protein (144 mg cumulative) of food challenge material in a double-blind, placebo-
controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) at screening. 
Randomisation was stratified by broad geographic region (to include North America and Europe) and 
age (children aged 4-17 years, inclusive, and adults aged 18-55 years, inclusive). 
Exclusion criteria (summary of most notable) 
•  Subjects with significant cardiovascular disease, intolerance to epinephrine for any reason, of 
chronic disease (mast cell disorder) and malignancies, a history of severe or life-threatening 
episode of anaphylaxis or anaphylactic reactions of severe asthma. In addition, patients with a 
history of eosinophilic GI diseases, including recurrent GI symptoms of undiagnosed etiology 
were excluded. 
Treatments 
Treatment with Palforzia was administered in 3 sequential phases: Initial dose escalation, up-dosing, 
and maintenance. Both the peanut and placebo (oat flour) challenge materials were matched for 
consistency and taste and mixed with food. 
During initial dose escalation on day 1 at the study site, subjects received escalating doses of Palforzia 
(0.5-6 mg) or placebo at 20- to 30-minute intervals.  
On day 2, patients who tolerated at least 3 mg of Palforzia or placebo could initiate the up-dosing 
phase on day 3.  
During up-dosing, subjects received escalating doses from 3 to 300 mg/day of Palforzia or placebo at 
2-week intervals as tolerated. The first dose at each new dose level and the first dose of each kit 
issued during maintenance was given at the study site. Daily dosing continued at home. Study product 
doses could be reduced, held, or withheld due to adverse events (AEs) or allergy symptoms at 
investigator discretion. 
Subjects who tolerated 300 mg/day of Palforzia or placebo continued receiving that dose for 
maintenance treatment.  
The dosing regimen (which is also applicable for study ARC010) is illustrated on Figure 2. 
Treatment Administered: Procedures for preparation and administration were the same at the study 
site or at home. Capsules or sachets containing Palforzia or placebo were emptied into and mixed with 
a vehicle food supplied by the sponsor (applesauce, pudding) or other palatable, age-appropriate, food 
(e.g. yogurt). The volume of the vehicle food was to be such that the entire dose could be consumed in 
a few spoonfuls/mouthfuls in one sitting. Each dose of study product was to be consumed at a 
consistent time (within 4 hours) each day, with an interval of at least 8 hours between doses. 
Dose Modification: Study product doses could be adjusted if the scheduled dose was missed or not 
tolerated (severity grading of allergic reactions to study product).  
Procedures following missed consecutive doses of peanut OIT are presented in Figure 2.

Objectives 
Primary Objectives 
• 
To demonstrate the efficacy of Palforzia, a pharmaceutical-grade peanut allergen 
formulation, through reduction in clinical reactivity to limited amounts of peanut 
allergen in peanut-allergic children aged 4 to 17 years, inclusive 
Secondary Objectives 
• 
• 
To demonstrate the safety of Palforzia measured by the incidence of adverse events, 
including serious adverse events, in children aged 4 to 17 years, inclusive 
To evaluate the immunologic effects of peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) therapy in 
children aged 4 to 17 years, inclusive 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
• 
The proportion of subjects aged 4 to 17 years who tolerated a single highest dose of at least 
1000 mg peanut protein (2043 mg cumulatively) (Europe) and 600 mg peanut protein (1043 
mg cumulative) (North America) with no more than mild symptoms at the exit DBPCFC. 
Key secondary endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The proportion of subjects aged 4 to 17 years who tolerate a single highest dose of at least 
600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms at the Exit 
DBPCFC; 
The proportion of subjects aged 4 to 17 years who tolerate a single highest dose of at least 
300 mg (443 mg cumulative) of peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms at the Exit 
DBPCFC; 
The maximum severity of symptoms in subjects aged 4 to 17 years occurring at any challenge 
dose of peanut protein during the Exit DBPCFC; 
The proportion of subjects aged 18 to 55 years who tolerate a single highest dose of at least 
1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms at the 
Exit DBPCFC. 
Sample size, Randomisation, Blinding (masking) 
The sample size for this study (approximately 500 subjects) was selected to provide sufficient power to 
detect a treatment difference for the primary efficacy analysis. In Europe, the sample size was 
expected to be adequate to demonstrate a higher desensitisation response rate for the primary efficacy 
analysis for Palforzia compared with placebo at a significance level of 0.05. 
Patients were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to the two treatment arms (Palforzia and placebo). The 
randomisation was stratified by broad geographic region (North America and Europe) and age (children 
up to 17 and adults to age 55).  
It was a double-blind study. The study as a whole was not planned to be unblinded until after the last 
subject exits ARC003 and the database is locked. However, patients became de facto unblinded after 
the Exit DBPCFC as subjects who fail 1 part of the exit food challenge may reasonably deduce that they 
Assessment report  
Page 34/35 
 
 
  
 
were in the placebo arm of the study, and those who tolerate both parts may deduce that they were in 
the Palforzia arm.  
Statistical methods 
The intention-to-treat (ITT) population was used as the primary analysis population for all analyses of 
efficacy endpoints. All individuals who dropped out of the study or discontinued OIT prior to undergoing 
the Exit DBPCFC were considered treatment failures.  
Data was summarised descriptively by treatment arm and overall. The descriptive summary for the 
categorical variables included counts and percentages. The descriptive summary for the continuous 
variables included means, medians, standard deviations and minimum and maximum values.  
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects aged 4 to 17 years who achieve desensitisation as 
determined by tolerating a single highest dose of at least 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) of peanut 
protein with no more than mild symptoms at the Exit DBPCFC (i.e., responders). The desensitisation 
response rate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each treatment group with 
Wilson (score) confidence limits for the binomial proportion. The Farrington-Manning test was used to 
test that the difference in response rates (Palforzia minus Placebo) was not equal to 0 at the 0.05 
significance level. Palforzia was considered to have met primary efficacy endpoint if the lower bound of 
the corresponding test-based 95% confidence interval is greater than 0.

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 3 Subject disposition flow chart (all subjects, 4-17 years) (ARC003) 
A total of 750 subjects aged 4 to 17 years were screened. 499 were randomly assigned to study 
treatment (374 to Palforzia and 125 to placebo).  
Of the 374 subjects randomly assigned to Palforzia, 2 did not receive treatment (1 withdrew consent 
and 1 due to randomisation error). Of the 125 subjects randomly assigned to placebo, 1 withdrew 
consent before receiving treatment. 
A total of 294 of 374 (78.6%) subjects in the Palforzia group and 115 of 125 (92.0%) subjects in the 
placebo group completed the study. The most common reason for discontinuation of study treatment 
was subject withdrew consent (31 [8.3%] Palforzia and 6 [4.8%] placebo), followed by adverse event 
(34 [9.1%] Palforzia and 2 [1.6%] placebo). No subject discontinued the study due to a protocol 
violation or sponsor decision. No subject died during the study. 
Of 21.4% Palforzia-treated and 8.0% placebo-treated subjects who did not complete the study, 
discontinuation was treatment related for 10.7% of subjects in the Palforzia group and 1.6% of 
subjects in the placebo group. Chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events caused 
discontinuation for 16 (4.3%) subjects in the Palforzia group and no subjects in the placebo group.

A total of 92 subjects aged 18 to 55 years were screened and 56 were randomly assigned to study 
treatment (42 to Palforzia and 14 to placebo). Of the 36 (39.1%) subjects who did not pass screening 
procedures, the primary reason for exclusion from randomisation was that the subject did not meet the 
screening DBPCFC criterion of dose-limiting symptoms to a single dose of peanut protein ≤ 100 mg 
(17 subjects, 18.5%). Thirteen subjects (14.1%) were not randomised for other (not specified) 
reasons and 6 (6.5%) subjects withdrew consent.  
Recruitment 
First subject screened: 22 December 2015; First subject dosed: 15 January 2016; Last subject visit: 
21 December 2017. 
Conduct of the study 
The applicant reported 11 amendments protocols (2 global, 2 region-specific, 6 site-specific, and 1 
country-specific). The Protocol Amendment 4 (Global) dated 31 July 2017 included the following major 
changes: Modified the age range (Changed the age range from 4 to 55 years to 4 to 17 years for 
primary and secondary objectives and clarified that the age range was 4 to 17 years for primary and 
secondary endpoints, unless specified otherwise.). In addition, the separation of the primary efficacy 
endpoint for North America and Europe was submitted. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics for Subjects 4 to 17 Years, ITT population 
The median age was 9 years and was the same for both treatment groups. Most subjects were male 
(55.9% Palforzia, 61.3% placebo) and white (78.5%, 78.2%). The proportion of Asian subjects was 
higher in the Palforzia group (11.0%) compared with the placebo group (6.5%). Black subjects made 
up less than 2% of the total pediatric population (1.6% Palforzia, 2.4% placebo). Most subjects were 
enrolled in North America (81.0%) compared with Europe (19.0%); the proportion was similar 
between treatment groups.  
As most subjects in study ARC003 were enrolled in North America (81.0%) compared with Europe 
(19.0%), the applicant conducted a second Europe-only, efficacy and safety Phase 3 study (ARC010, 
n=160 subjects; randomised 3:1; age group 4-17 years, see below) to the Palforzia programme. 
Baseline Characteristics (ITT population): More than half of subjects in each treatment group had a 
history of asthma (53.2% Palforzia, 52.4% placebo). About two-thirds of subjects in both treatment 
groups were allergic to foods other than peanut. 
Subjects in both groups had a history of systemic allergic reaction (72.3% Palforzia, 71.8% placebo) 
and 29.0% in both groups received epinephrine for their most recent reaction. 
Baseline median peanut-specific IgE was numerically higher in the placebo group compared with the 
Palforzia group (68.95 kUA/L Palforzia, 74.80 kUA/L placebo); baseline median peanut-specific IgG4 
was similar between treatment groups (0.570 mgA/L Palforzia, 0.610 mgA/L placebo). The median 
ratio of peanut-specific IgE to IgG4 was higher for the placebo group (155.93) compared with the 
Palforzia group (131.25). 
The median mean wheal diameter in the screening skin prick test to peanut was 11.0 mm for the 
Palforzia group and 12.0 mm for the placebo group.

Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy Results: Results are presented for the primary study population of subjects aged 4 to 17 years 
(pediatric subset) and summarised for the ITT population, unless otherwise noted. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for study ARC003 was met. Treatment with Palforzia resulted in a 
statistically significant treatment effect over placebo in the proportion of subjects aged 4 to 17 years 
who tolerated a single highest dose of at least 1000 mg peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative) with no 
more than mild symptoms at the exit DBPCFC after approximately 6 months of maintenance 
treatment.  
Of 372 subjects in the ITT population who received Palforzia, the desensitisation response rate was 
50.3% (95% CI: 45.2, 55.3) compared with 2.4% (95% CI: 0.8, 6.9) for the 124 subjects who 
received placebo. The treatment difference (Palforzia-placebo) was 47.8% (95% CI: 38.0, 57.7; p < 
0.0001). The results of the primary efficacy endpoint seem conclusive. 
The key secondary endpoint - proportion of subjects who tolerated a single highest dose of at least 600 
mg peanut protein (1043 mg cumulative) with no more than mild symptoms at the exit DBPCFC - was 
met. Treatment with Palforzia resulted in a statistically significant (adjusted for multiplicity) treatment 
effect over placebo. Of 372 subjects aged 4 to 17 years in the ITT population who received Palforzia, 
the desensitisation response rate was 67.2% (95% CI: 62.3, 71.8) compared with 4.0% (95% CI: 1.7, 
9.1) for 124 subjects who received placebo. The treatment difference (Palforzia-placebo) was 63.2% 
(95% CI: 53.0, 73.3; p < 0.0001).

The secondary efficacy endpoints support the effects seen in the primary endpoint. Results of the 
secondary efficacy endpoints seem conclusive. Additionally, the high amount of other efficacy 
endpoints that were assessed support the favourable efficacy compared to placebo. 
Only the last key secondary efficacy endpoint of the proportion of adult subjects aged 18 to 55 years in 
the ITT population (41 Palforzia, 14 placebo) who tolerated a single highest dose of at least 1000 mg 
peanut protein at the exit DBPCFC was not met. Of 41 subjects aged 18 to 55 years in the ITT 
population who received Palforzia, the desensitisation response rate was 34.1% (95% CI: 21.6, 49.5) 
compared with 14.3% (95% CI: 4.0, 39.9) for 14 subjects who received placebo. The treatment 
difference (Palforzia-placebo) was 19.9% (95% CI: -7.7, 47.4; p=0.1578). In addition, the 
discontinuation rate was high for adults (about half discontinued early). Reasons for this might be 
associated with the small number of adults who participated, but may also be associated with other 
(immunomodulatory) effects and induced side effects. This might be addressed in another trial/another 
power. Nevertheless the current indication focuses on subjects 4 – 17 years of age. For this age group 
efficacy has been documented. 
With regard to assessments of quality of life (QoL), treatment with Palforzia resulted in similar QoL as 
measured by subject- and parent-reported the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire (FAQLQ) and 
Food Allergy Independent Measure (FAIM) total scores from baseline to exit. This result reflects other 
literature data on this topic. In addition, a change in QoL aspects needs more time, than the duration 
of this study – where many subjects experienced an improvement in tolerated amount of peanut 
protein, but still were blinded and did not “experience” real life situations. 
At the request from CHMP, paediatric subgroups in the ITT population were analysed by geographic 
region (Europe, North America), by age group (4-11 years, 12-17 years), and by region and age 
group (Europe 4-11 years, 12-17 years; North America 4-11 years, 12-17 years). All performed 
supportive analyses to the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent with the overall ITT results, 
except the supportive analysis for the Europe region in the 12 to 17 year age group, which was not 
statistically significant (tolerated 1000 mg peanut protein: 55.6% Palforzia, 33.3% placebo; treatment 
difference, 22.2% [95% CI: -37.3, 81.7]; p = 0.4642). This could be explained due to low numbers of 
participants in the EU region (27 vs 3).  
In order to further characterise the populations, who might profit most, the applicant was asked to 
provide further efficacy data comparing highly allergic individuals with less allergic patients by 
subdividing patients by degree of severity in peanut-allergic individuals in several subgroups including 
specific sensitisation levels and baseline food challenge results, as well as age and patients history. 
Performed analysis according to age revealed robust efficacy data for included subjects aged 4-17 
years. From these, a higher response rates in younger children, aged 4-11 years (52.5%) versus older 
children, aged 12-17 years (46.3%) was observed. 
By performing the descriptive sub analyses according to subgroups as defined by IgE, SPT, and 
DBPCFC, younger, less sensitive subjects, seem to develop the best efficacy rates. However, these 
descriptive post-hoc sub analysis can only be considered exploratory, as the studies were not 
designed to investigate such subgroups. In addition, especially in the age group of 12-17 years, 
sample sizes are too small to enable persistent conclusions. 
Ancillary analyses 
With regard to concomitant medications during the study, differences between study groups may be 
mentioned for drugs for the respiratory system (49.2% Palforzia-treated subjects and 38.7% placebo-
treated subjects). The use of concomitant medications in adults was comparable to that in pediatric 
subjects.  
Assessment report  
Page 39/40 
 
 
  
 
Regarding rescue medications, differences mainly occurred during the up-dosing phase and at the exit 
DBPCFC. At the exit DBPCFC, 31.1% of subjects in the Palforzia group and 89.7% of subjects in the 
placebo group received any rescue medication; During initial dose escalation and up-dosing, a higher 
proportion of Palforzia-treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects used any rescue 
medication (69.1% and 48.4%); however, the use of any rescue medication during maintenance was 
similar between treatment groups (44.5% Palforzia and 41.5% placebo). This trend was generally 
observed for all ATC classes of rescue medications and generic drug names, except adrenergic and 
dopaminergic agents (epinephrine) were used by more subjects in the Palforzia group than in the 
placebo group during both initial dose escalation/up-dosing (10.8% Palforzia and 4.0% placebo) and 
during maintenance (8.1% and 3.4%). 
In the adult subset of the safety population, the overall profile of rescue medication use was similar to 
that of the pediatric subset during initial dose escalation/up-dosing and maintenance. 
Treatment compliance in the pediatric subset was described as approximately 98-99% for both 
treatment groups during up-dosing and, during maintenance. The mean percentage of planned dosing 
days where a dose was missed was less than 3% for both treatment groups during both periods (up-
dosing and maintenance).  
Immunoglobulin values were measured with regard to peanut-specific (ps) IgE and IgG4. The overall 
trend in ps-IgE in the Palforzia group was an increase from screening to the end of up-dosing and a 
decrease to the exit DBPCFC whereas values were more or less similar at all time-points in the placebo 
group. Peanut-specific IgG4 increased from screening to the exit DBPCFC in the Palforzia group and 
remained similar over time in the placebo. Consequently, the ps-IgE/IgG4 ratio decreased in the 
Palforzia from screening to exit DBPCFC and was constant in the placebo group. 
Study ARC010 - AR101 Trial in Europe Measuring Oral Immunotherapy 
Success in Peanut Allergic Children (ARTEMIS) 
Methods 
Study design 
ARC010 phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of Palforzia in peanut-allergic subjects aged 4 to 17 years. The study consisted of 
screening and double-blind treatment periods that included initial dose escalation (2 days), up-dosing 
(20-40 weeks), and maintenance treatment (approximately 12-16 weeks). The study design is 
illustrated in Figure 4.. In ARC010 study, the maintenance treatment was shorter than in ARC003 
study (ARC010: 12-16 weeks; ARC003: 24-28 weeks). 
Study Participants 
Inclusion criteria (the most notable) 
•  Subjects aged 4 – 17 years (inclusive)  
•  Subjects with clinical history of peanut allergy or peanut-containing foods; 
•  Subjects with serum i IgE to peanut of ≥ 0.35 kUA/L and/or a peanut skin prick test mean 
wheal diameter ≥ 3 mm at the time of screening; 
•  Subjects who had dose-limiting symptoms (type I hypersensitivity symptoms) after consuming 
≤ 300 mg peanut protein (444 mg cumulative) food challenge material in a DBPCFC at 
screening  
Assessment report  
Page 40/41 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Exclusion criteria (the most notable) 
• 
Patients with significant cardiovascular disease, intolerance to epinephrine for any reason, of 
chronic disease (mast cell disorder) and malignancies, a history of severe or life-threatening 
episode of anaphylaxis or anaphylactic reactions of severe asthma. In addition, patients with a 
history of eosinophilic GI diseases, including recurrent GI symptoms of undiagnosed etiology 
were excluded. 
Treatments 
As in Study ARC003, the treatment with Palforzia was administered in 3 sequential phases: Initial Dose 
Escalation (first day), up-dosing at 2-week intervals and maintenance. The only difference was the 
length of the maintenance treatment which was shorter in ARC010 (12-16 weeks). 
The dosing regimen is illustrated in Figure 4. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of study AR010 was to demonstrate the efficacy of Palforzia through reduction in 
clinical reactivity to limited amounts of peanut allergen in peanut-allergic children and adolescents 
aged 4 to 17 years, inclusive.  
The secondary objective was to demonstrate the safety of Palforzia measured by the incidence of 
adverse events, including serious adverse events and to evaluate the immunologic effects of peanut 
OIT therapy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who tolerated a single dose of at least 1000 mg 
peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative) with no more than mild symptoms at the exit DBPCFC. The 
primary efficacy endpoint was evaluated using the ITT population.   
The key secondary endpoints were: 
o  Desensitisation response rate at a single dose of 600 mg peanut protein: The proportion of 
subjects who tolerated a single dose of at least 600 mg peanut protein (1043 mg cumulative) 
with no more than mild symptoms at the exit DBPCFC. 
o  Desensitisation response rate at a single dose of 300 mg peanut protein: The proportion of 
subjects who tolerated a single dose of at least 300 mg peanut protein (443 mg cumulative) 
with no more than mild symptoms at the exit DBPCFC. 
o  The maximum severity of symptoms that occurred at any challenge dose of peanut protein 
during the exit DBPCFC. 
Sample size, Randomisation, Blinding (masking) 
The sample size of this study (approximately 160 subjects) was selected to provide sufficient power to 
detect a treatment difference for the primary efficacy analysis.  
Randomisation (Palforzia or placebo 3:1) was performed using an interactive response system on day 1 
of initial dose escalation. 
This was a double-blind study. Placebo capsules were identical in appearance to the Palforzia capsules 
and contained excipients color-matched to the peanut flour that were identical to the Palforzia 
capsules. Matching placebo sachets were also provided for maintenance treatment. Placebo was 
administered in the same manner as Palforzia. 
Assessment report  
Page 41/42 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieve desensitisation as determined by 
tolerating 1000 mg as a single dose (2043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein (i.e., a top single 
challenge dose of 1000 mg) with no more than mild symptoms at the Exit DBPCFC (i.e., responders). 
An ITT analysis was performed as the primary efficacy analysis to test for a treatment difference in the 
response rate. All individuals who drop out of the study or discontinue OIT prior to undergoing the Exit 
DBPCFC will be considered treatment failures (i.e., Missing = Failure). 
Fisher’s exact test was planned to be used to test the treatment difference for desensitisation and 
exact CIs will be constructed as follows: (1) exact Clopper Pearson confidence limits were used for the 
binomial proportion and (2) exact unconditional confidence limits based on the score statistic were 
used for the difference in proportions. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints were planned to be tested in the ITT population in hierarchical 
order. 
Each comparison was planned to be evaluated for statistical significance (two-sided p < 0.05) only if all 
of the preceding tests (not including supportive tests) in the hierarchy and the primary analysis of the 
primary endpoint are statistically significant in favor of Palforzia. Key secondary desensitisation 
response rates were evaluated for statistical significance using the same analytical methods used for 
the primary endpoint analysis. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of missing data on the robustness of the 
primary efficacy endpoint using a worst-case approach to missing data imputation. For subjects with 
missing data (ie, no exit DBPCFC), placebo-treated subjects were considered responders and Palforzia-
treated subjects were considered non-responders. 
Results 
Participant flow  
A total of 175 subjects aged 4 to 17 years were randomly assigned to study treatment (132 to 
Palforzia and 43 to placebo). Of these, 106 of 132 subjects (80.3%) in the Palforzia group and 40 of 43 
subjects (93.0%) in the placebo group completed the study. The most common reason for study 
discontinuation in the Palforzia group was adverse events or symptoms (14, 10.6%), followed by other 
(5, 3.8%) and withdrew consent (4, 3.0%). Reasons for study discontinuation in the placebo group 
were chronic/recurrent GI AEs/symptoms, withdrew consent, and other for 1 subject each (2.3%).  
The participant flow is presented in Figure 4.

Recruitment 
The first subject dose: 26 June 2017; Last subjects visit: 15 February 2019. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 10 protocol amendments (3 global, 3 site-specific, and 4 country-specific).  
With amendment 1 inclusion criterion 3 was modified to remove the upper limit of serum IgE to peanut 
and include subjects with serum Ig to peanut of at least 35 kUA/L. Amendment 2, among others, 
modified exclusion criteria and contraception procedure, and added accidental food allergen exposure, 
severe adverse events, and adverse events associated with epinephrine use as adverse events of 
interest. 
Protocol Amendment 3 clarified - among others- that subjects could continue blinded study treatment 
in ARC010 if the follow-on study ARC008 was not yet available at the study site. 
Major protocol deviation occurred in 21 subjects (15.9%) receiving AR101 and in 9 subjects (20.9&) 
receiving placebo. 
The amendments as well the number and types of protocol deviations are considered acceptable and 
unlikely to have impacted the results of the study.

Baseline data 
For ARC010 study the demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among the treatment 
groups. Median age of the 175 subjects was 8.0 years (range, 4-17 years). Most subjects in both 
treatment groups were aged 4 to 11 years (73.5% Palforzia, 69.8% placebo) and more than half were 
male (51.5%, 62.8%). Most subjects were white (81.8% Palforzia, 81.4% placebo) and were not of 
Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (90.2%, 90.7%). A total of 40.0% of the overall population reported a 
history of asthma (42.4% Palforzia, 32.6% placebo). 
The median peanut-specific IgG4 (0.3 mgA/L Palforzia, 0.4 mgA/L placebo) and the median ratio of 
peanut-specific IgE to IgG4 (138.55 AR101, 146.43 placebo) were similar in both groups. The median 
mean wheal diameter in the screening skin prick test to peanut was similar between treatment groups 
(9.50 mm Palforzia, 9.75 mm placebo). 
Overall, baseline disease characteristics were similar between the placebo and Palforzia treatment 
groups and mean baseline values for all assessments were consistent.

Outcomes and estimation 
In study ARC010 all prespecified primary and key secondary endpoints of desensitisation response 
(1000 mg, 600 mg, 300 mg) and maximum severity of symptoms at any challenge dose of peanut 
protein during the exit DBPCFC in the ITT population were met. The treatment with Palforzia resulted 
in a statistically significant treatment effect over placebo in the proportion of subjects aged 4 to 17 
years who tolerated a single dose of at least 1000 mg peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative). Of 132 
subjects in the ITT population who received Palforzia, the desensitisation response rate was 58.3% 
Assessment report

(95% CI: 49.4, 66.8) compared with 2.3% (95% CI: 0.1, 12.3) for 43 subjects who received placebo. 
The treatment difference (Palforzia-placebo) was 56.0% (95% CI: 44.1, 65.2); p < 0.0001.  
Key secondary endpoints: 
Desensitisation response rate at a single dose of 1000 mg peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative): 
58.3% Palforzia and 2.3% placebo; treatment difference, 56.0% (95% CI: 44.1, 65.2; p < 0.0001) 
Desensitisation response rate at a single dose of 600 mg peanut protein (1043 mg cumulative): 68.2% 
Palforzia and 9.3% placebo; treatment difference, 58.9% (95% CI: 44.2, 69.3; p < 0.0001) 
Desensitisation response rate at a single dose of 300 mg peanut protein (443 mg cumulative): 73.5% 
Palforzia and 16.3% placebo; treatment difference, 57.2% (95% CI: 41.2, 69.1; p < 0.0001) 
A clinically meaningful reduction in the maximum severity of symptoms at any challenge dose of 
peanut protein was observed at the exit DBPCFC for the Palforzia group compared with the placebo 
group (p < 0.0001). Palforzia treatment resulted in immunologic changes throughout the study as 
demonstrated by changes in peanut-specific IgE, IgG4, IgE/IgG4 ratio, and mean wheal diameter in 
the skin prick test from baseline to study exit. 
These results are consistent with the results of the pivotal study ARC003 conducted in Europe and 
North America. 
At the request from CHMP, supportive analyses to the primary efficacy endpoint for study ARC010 
were performed. Treatment differences (Palforzia-placebo) were consistent with the primary efficacy 
endpoint for the regional populations by country in countries that enrolled a sufficient number of 
subjects. Subgroup analyses by age group (4-11 years, 12-17 years) for the primary efficacy endpoint 
were also consistent with the overall ITT results; however, the treatment difference was less, but still 
statistically significant for the smaller age group of 12 to 17 years. Among patients aged 4-11 years, 
52-60% tolerated 1000 mg peanut protein, while 45-46% patients aged 12-17 years and 34% of 
patients aged 18-55 years met this endpoint at the exit DBPCFC.  
In order to further characterise the populations, who might profit most, the applicant was asked to 
provide further efficacy data comparing highly allergic individuals with less allergic patients by 
subdividing patients by degree of severity in peanut-allergic individuals in several subgroups including 
specific sensitisation levels and baseline food challenge results, as well as age and patients history. 
Performed analysis according to age revealed robust efficacy data for included subjects aged 4-17 
years. From these, a higher response rates in younger children, aged 4-11 years (62.9%) versus older 
children, aged 12-17 years (45.7%) was observed. Interestingly, the highest response rate (62.9%) 
was reached in children aged 4-11 years in the European only study ARC010, although their treatment 
maintenance phase was half as long as in ARC003. This may be associated with slightly different 
inclusion criteria (leading to “some less sensitive subjects” being included), but it may also support 
the impact of “age”, as included children were slightly younger in ARC010 (median 8 years). 
By performing the descriptive sub analyses according to subgroups as defined by IgE, SPT, and 
DBPCFC, younger, less sensitive subjects, seem to develop the best efficacy rates. However, these 
descriptive post-hoc sub analysis can only be considered exploratory, as the studies were not 
designed to investigate such subgroups. In addition, especially in the age group of 12-17 years, 
sample sizes are too small to enable persistent conclusions. 
Ancillary analyses 
The primary efficacy analysis was repeated for the ITT population age subgroups of 4 to 11 years and 
12 to 17 years. The results were consistent with the overall population although the treatment 
difference was less for the much smaller age group of 12 to 17 years (35 Palforzia, 13 placebo; 45.7%

Overall summary results for ARC003 and ARC001 studies 
No pooled analyses, respectively meta-analysis was possible. Nevertheless, central aspects between 
the 2 pivotal phase 3 studies ARC003 and ARC010 overlap. ARC003 was a large, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study of Palforzia in subjects with peanut allergy aged 4 to 55 years 
conducted in Europe and North America. ARC010 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, multicentre study of Palforzia in subjects with peanut allergy aged 4 to 17 years conducted 
in Europe. 
In both studies, subjects were randomly assigned to blinded treatment 3:1 (Palforzia to placebo) to 
ensure that subject populations were similar in the test and control groups and to eliminate bias. 
Efficacy data from these studies were not integrated for this application due to differences in study 
eligibility requirements and study duration. As studies ARC003 and ARC010 differed in certain points, a 
direct comparison of results is not possible.

Use of Epinephrine as Rescue Medication in DBPCFCs 
The proportion of subjects with any epinephrine use during the peanut challenge day of the screening 
DBPCFC was higher in ARC003 compared with ARC010 (~36.4% vs ~20.5%), possibly due to different 
rates of epinephrine use in Europe compared with North America. 
In both ARC003 and ARC010, the overall use of epinephrine during the peanut challenge day of the 
exit DBPCFC was less frequent for subjects treated with Palforzia compared with placebo.

Changes in Peanut-Specific IgE and IgG4 
The change from baseline in immunoglobulin values was evaluated for subjects aged 4 to 17 years in 
the ITT and completer populations of ARC003 and ARC010. In both studies, the overall trend in 
peanut-specific IgE in the Palforzia group was an increase from screening to the end of up-dosing and 
a decrease to the exit DBPCFC. The overall trend in peanut-specific IgE in the placebo group was an 
increase from screening to the end of up-dosing and a small decrease or no change to the exit 
DBPCFC. Peanut-specific IgG4 increased and the peanut-specific IgE/IgG4 ratio decreased from 
screening to exit for the Palforzia group compared with the placebo group.  
Changes in Peanut Skin Prick Test 
For subjects aged 4 to 17 years in the ITT population of both ARC003 and ARC010, the mean wheal 
diameter in the skin prick test decreased overall from baseline to study exit for the Palforzia group 
compared with the placebo group. The mean (SD) wheal diameter was similar between treatment 
groups at baseline and was decreased at the end of up-dosing (300 mg visit) and at study exit for the 
Palforzia group compared with the placebo group. The change from baseline to exit in mean (SD) 
wheal diameter was greater for the Palforzia group compared with the placebo group. 
The applicant described, that similar treatment effects were observed in the phase 2 studies ARC001 
and ARC002.  
2.5.4.  Clinical studies in special populations 
Children 
Palforzia was mainly investigated in children (1-17 yrs) as the marketing authorisation is sought for 
this age group. Limited data is available in adults (> 18 years of age). No data are available for the 
elderly population. 
Subjects who turn age 18 years during Palforzia treatment 
Among subjects who completed studies ARC003, ARC004, and ARC010, 14 subjects reached age 18 
years before completing the exit DBPCFC. Of these 14 subjects, 9 were treated with Palforzia (ARC003 
(9 subjects; 5 Palforzia, 4 placebo), ARC004 (4 subjects; all Palforzia), and ARC010 (1 subject; 
placebo)). In ARC003, 4 of 5 subjects who reached age 18 years after beginning Palforzia treatment 
tolerated a single highest dose of 1000 mg peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms during 
the ARC003 exit DBPCFC, compared with 0 of 4 placebo-treated subjects. All 4 Palforzia-treated 
subjects who reached age 18 years during study ARC004 tolerated a single highest dose of 1000 mg 
peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms during the ARC003 exit DBPCFC, and clinically 
meaningful desensitization was maintained after an additional approximately 28 weeks of Palforzia 
treatment: 2 subjects tolerated a single highest dose of 2000 mg peanut protein, 1 subject tolerated 
1000 mg peanut protein, and 1 subject tolerated 600 mg peanut protein with no more than mild 
symptoms during the ARC004 exit DBPCFC. The placebo-treated subject in ARC010 who reached age 
18 years had a single highest tolerated dose of 1 mg at the exit DBPCFC.  
During the evaluation, the applicant provided an updated data set and reported of n = 51 patients, 
which were enrolled at age ≤ 17 years and subsequently turned age 18 during treatment with 
Palforzia (enrolled in different studies: ARC003, ARC010, ARC0101 respectively in follow-on studies 
ARC004 and ARC008). From these 51 patients nearly two-thirds of the subjects who turned age 18 
during Palforzia treatment (33 subjects, 64.7%) remain ongoing in the follow-on study ARC008. From 
the limited efficacy data which were available for 27 of these patients the applicant assumed that the 
general profile of efficacy is similar to other age groups.

2.5.5.  Supportive studies 
ARC004 – Peanut Allergy Oral Immunotherapy Study of Palforzia for Desensitization in 
Children and Adults (PALISADE) Follow-On Study 
ARC004 was an international, multicentre, open-label, 2-arm follow-on Phase 3 study to ARC003 
designed to allow subjects who received placebo in ARC003 the opportunity to receive Palforzia and to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Palforzia in children and adults with peanut allergy.  
The final clinical study report (CSR) ARC004 (finalised 14 Feb 2020) was submitted with the responses 
to the D120 list of questions. An overview of the ARC004 study design, disposition of subjects aged 
4 to 17 years, and key conclusions with supporting data are described below.   
Study Design 
Subjects who completed placebo treatment in ARC003 and subjects who received Palforzia and 
tolerated ≥ 300 mg peanut protein (443 mg cumulative) at the ARC003 exit DBPCFC could enroll in 
ARC004. Treatment paths for this open-label follow-on study were as follows:   
Group 1 (placebo-treated subjects in ARC003): Subjects received Palforzia during IDE (day 1, 0.5 to 3 
or 6 mg; day 2, 3 mg), up-dosing (3-300 mg/day for 22-40 weeks, with dose escalations every 
2 weeks), and maintenance (300 mg/day for 24-28 weeks). A DBPCFC after approximately 6 months 
of maintenance treatment evaluated up to a single highest dose of 2000 mg peanut protein food 
challenge material (4043 mg cumulative). Subjects who tolerated a single highest dose of at least 
300 mg in the DBPCFC could receive Palforzia during extended maintenance in gradually increasing 
dosing intervals depending on the results from group 2. The total duration of Palforzia treatment in 
group 1 was 88 to 136 weeks.   
Group 2 (Palforzia-treated subjects who tolerated ≥ 300 mg peanut protein in the exit DBPCFC in 
ARC003): Subjects were assigned to 1 of 3 sequential dose cohorts in group 2. The first approximately 
120 subjects received 300 mg/day (once daily, QD) for 28 weeks in cohort 1. The next approximately 
50 subjects received 300 mg every other day (QOD) for 4 weeks, then twice weekly (BIW) for 
24 weeks for a total of 28 weeks in cohort 2. All remaining subjects were assigned to 1 of 3 dosing 
regimens in cohort 3:   
•  Cohort 3A: 300 mg/day for 56 weeks  
•  Cohort 3B: 300 mg/day for 28 weeks, QOD for 4 weeks, then BIW for 24 weeks (total of 
56 weeks) 
•  Cohort 3C: 300 mg/day for 28 weeks, QOD for 4 weeks, BIW for 24 weeks, then once weekly 
(QW) for 28 weeks (total of 84 weeks) 
Disposition of Subjects 
A total of 358 subjects aged 4 to 17 years who completed study ARC003 were enrolled and 
351 subjects were treated with Palforzia in study ARC004: 102 were enrolled in group 1 (former 
placebo) and 256 in group 2 (former Palforzia). Group 2 was further divided into cohorts (112 subjects 
in cohort 1, 48 in cohort 2, 31 in cohort 3A, 31 in cohort 3B, 34 in cohort 3C).   
In group 1, 55 of 102 subjects (53.9%) completed the study. In group 2, 206 of 256 subjects (80.5%) 
completed the study (102 subjects in cohort 1, 38 in cohort 2, 26 in cohort 3A, 21 in cohort 3B, 19 in 
cohort 3C); completion rates were higher for cohorts with only QD dosing (83.9%-91.1%) than 
nondaily dosing (55.9%-79.2%). Reasons for discontinuation are summarised in the subject disposition 
flow chart.

Results 
Considering the low number of participants per group, the applicant summarised following Key Study 
Conclusions: 
The key efficacy, safety, immunomodulation, and quality of life conclusions are presented for subjects 
aged 4 to 17 years at time of enrolment in ARC004.    
Efficacy: longer duration of once daily (QD) dosing was associated with maintained or improved 
effectiveness of desensitisation.   
•  Progressive desensitisation over time was observed in subjects with up to 18 months of 
Palforzia dosing at 300 mg/day, with no indication of a plateaued response with longer-term 
dosing.   
•  Desensitisation response rates at the exit DBPCFC were consistently high between groups and 
across cohorts at each challenge dose of peanut protein (300, 600, 1000, 2000 mg), and were 
generally higher for group 1 (former placebo) and the group 2 cohorts with only QD dosing 
(28- and 56-week schedules) than for the cohorts that included nondaily every other day 
(QOD) and twice weekly (BIW) dosing.   
•  The greatest single highest tolerated dose increased from screening (baseline) to the exit 
DBPCFC, particularly in cohorts with only QD dosing, consistent with ongoing 
immunomodulatory effects of OIT and suggesting that desensitisation is better maintained and 
may improve over time with steady QD dosing compared with nondaily QOD and BIW dosing.   
•  Epinephrine use at any peanut challenge dose in the exit DBPCFC was lowest in the cohort with 
the longest dosing schedule (56 weeks).

Results from the maintenance DBPCFC were used for group 1 subjects who did not complete the exit DBPCFC.   
Confidence intervals were based on exact Clopper-Pearson intervals.   
Maintenance with QD dosing was more effective than maintenance with nondaily dosing: 
•  Maintaining consistent QD dosing over a longer (56 weeks) versus a shorter period (28 weeks) 
reduced the maximum severity of symptoms upon exposure to any challenge dose of peanut 
protein at the exit DBPCFC, and consistent QD dosing was more effective at reducing the 
maximum severity of symptoms at any challenge dose of peanut protein than schedules that 
included nondaily QOD and BIW dosing.   
Changes in peanut-specific immunoglobulins: Immunologic changes continued to improve over time.   
•  Treatment with Palforzia resulted in immunologic changes throughout the study consistent with 
published literature, as demonstrated by predicted changes in ps-IgE and IgG4, ps-IgE/IgG4 
ratio, and peanut SPT mean wheal diameter.   
Quality of life: Patient-reported outcomes indicated improved quality of life with longer-term 
treatment.   
•  Quality of life measured by subject- and parent-reported Food Allergy Quality of Life 
Questionnaire (FAQLQ) and Food Allergy Independent Measure (FAIM) exceeded the minimal 
clinically important differences in several domains related to disease-specific aspects.   
ARC007 - Real-World AR101 Market-Supporting Experience Study in Peanut-Allergic 
Children Ages 4 to 17 Years (RAMSES) 
Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study in North America evaluated 
the safety and tolerability of Palforzia in peanut-allergic subjects aged 4 to 17 years utilizing Palforzia.  
No efficacy endpoints were evaluated. However immune parameters, (secondary endpoints) are 
documented below, as these may support treatment effects. 
Design: The study consisted of a screening period and a double-blind treatment period that included 
initial dose escalation (2 days) and up-dosing (20-42 weeks), including at least 2 weeks of treatment 
at the maintenance dose of 300 mg/day.  
Objectives: 
Primary objective: 
• 
To assess the safety and tolerability of AR101 for approximately 6 months in peanut-allergic 
children aged 4 to 17 years, inclusive 
Assessment report  
Page 57/58 
 
 
  
 
 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
To measure the incidence of all treatment-related adverse events by study period, including 
adverse events of clinical interest 
To evaluate the effect of Palforzia on asthma control and immune parameters 
Results: 
Treatment with Palforzia resulted in immunologic changes throughout the study as demonstrated by 
changes in peanut IgE, IgG4, peanut IgE/IgG4 ratio, and mean peanut skin prick test wheal diameter 
consistent with previous studies. 
The mean (SD) change in total IgE, peanut-specific IgE, and peanut-specific IgG4 from baseline to the 
end of up-dosing (300 mg visit) was higher in the AR101 group compared with the placebo group. The 
mean (SD) change in total IgE from baseline to the end of up-dosing (300 mg visit) was 389.4 
(580.00) IU/mL for the AR101 group and -42.6 (328.11) IU/mL for the placebo group. The mean (SD) 
change in peanut-specific IgE from baseline to the end of up-dosing (300 mg visit) was 329.9 (506.30) 
kUA/L for the AR101 group and 60.3 (172.64) kUA/L for the placebo group. The mean (SD) change in 
peanut-specific IgG4 from baseline to the end of up-dosing (300 mg visit) was 6.347 (6.7742) mgA/L 
for the AR101 group and -0.149 (0.8602) mgA/L for the placebo group. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program for Palforzia was designed to demonstrated efficacy in the treatment 
of patients aged 4-17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut allergy and for patients turning 18 
years of age during treatment. The treatment should be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant 
diet. Palforzia is not intended for, and does not provide, immediate relief of allergic symptoms. 
Therefore, it is not to be used for emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Palforzia clinical development program in children, adolescents, and adults with peanut allergy 
included 2 phase 2 studies (ARC001, ARC002) and 7 phase 3 studies (ARC003, ARC004, ARC005, 
ARC007, ARC008, ARC010, ARC011). During the evaluation, study ARC004 (open-label follow-on 
ARC003 study) was completed and the final clinical study report was assessed during the procedure. 
In all Palforzia clinical studies, efficacy was measured using a DBPCFC. This food challenge is a model 
for real world accidental exposure to food allergens and was performed according to the Practical 
Allergy (PRACTALL) guidelines with modification to include a 600 mg protein dose (between the 
300 mg and 1000 mg challenge doses). 
Dose-response studies 
A “classical dose-finding” study was not performed for Palforzia within the development program. 
Selection and timing of each dose of peanut protein were based from literature data, as well as the 
work of the Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR).  
Treatment with Palforzia is proposed to be administered in 3 sequential phases: Initial dose escalation, 
up-dosing, and maintenance. A dose level can be considered tolerated if no more than transient 
symptoms are observed with no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required. 
Pivotal clinical studies (ARC003 and ARC010) 
Assessment report  
Page 58/59 
 
 
  
 
The efficacy of Palforzia was assessed in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, 
phase 3 pivotal studies ARC003 (PALISADE) and ARC010 (ARTEMIS).  
The first phase 3 pivotal study, ARC003, was conducted in both Europe and North America. In 
response to regulatory concerns that ARC003 did not enroll enough paediatric subjects from Europe to 
support the PIP, the applicant conducted ARC010, a second pivotal double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study in Europe only. The implementation of this “Europe-only” efficacy and safety phase 3 study was 
part of an EMA Scientific Advice, where differences in the study design between ARC003 and ARC010 
were discussed (e.g. duration of maintenance or inclusion DBPCFC) and finally agreed. 
Both studies consisted of screening and double-blind treatment periods that included initial dose 
escalation (2 days), up-dosing (20-40 weeks), and maintenance (approximately 24-28 weeks for 
ARC003 and approximately 12-16 weeks for ARC010). In ARC010 study, the maintenance treatment 
was shorter than in ARC003 study. 
A total of 671 randomised patients with peanut allergy contributed to the data efficacy analysis (ITT 
population ARC003 n=496; ARC010 n=175). 
In ARC003, initially, patients being 4-55 years of age were eligible for inclusion. However hardly any 
adults were randomised (n=55) and 80% of subjects enrolled were aged 4 to 17 years. Although this 
“selection” of age group goes in line with the typical manifestation of peanut allergy in childhood, and 
likewise EAACI recommendations suggest treatment in children from around 4-5 years of age but 
depicted no recommendations for adults with peanut allergy (EAACI Guideline: AIT for IgE-mediated 
Food Allergy, 201734), it is noted, that in opposite to the original, primary endpoint and key secondary 
efficacy evaluation, patients aged 18-55 years were subsequently excluded in ARC003 from the 
primary analyses set due to a protocol amendment. 
In ARC010, subjects included were aged between 4-17 years which corresponds to the age window of 
the Palforzia indication. 
For both studies, sample size and randomisation are considered acceptable. The overall SAP is agreed.  
Both studies recruited subjects with a documented history of peanut allergy. Inclusion criteria 
addressed peanut-specific sensitisation parameters, like peanut-specific IgE level ≥ 0.35 kU/L and a 
SPT-wheal response ≥ 3 cm. The patients could concomitantly have other (food) allergies and asthma, 
which however should be stable. The eligibility criteria were adequate for the inclusion of patients with 
peanut allergy and comparable across the clinical studies with little modifications for study ARC010 
pertaining to patients being slightly less sensitive to peanut protein. Additionally, a higher proportion 
of subjects in ARC003 had a history of systemic allergic reaction to peanut and a history of non-
peanut food allergy compared with subjects in ARC010. Nevertheless, in general, most baseline 
characteristics were rather similar among the treatment groups across the phase 3 but also across 
performed phase 2 studies. The mean baseline values for assessments (including peanut-specific IgE, 
IgG4, skin prick test diameter, history of allergic diseases including asthma) were consistent with 
peanut allergy. The CHMP concluded that the inclusion criteria were adequate and representative of 
the patient population likely to seek treatment. Nevertheless, mainly Caucasians have been included 
in the Palforzia development programme despite some studies reporting that African American 
individuals as compared to Caucasian individuals are more likely to be sensitised to a broad range of 
allergens including peanuts, which cannot be explained by culture and exposure. In this context, the 
applicant will analyse the spontaneous adverse events reports by the reported race to look for

differences in character any severity of the events. The results of this analysis will be reported in the 
periodic safety updated reports (PSURs). 
Subjects with a severe or life-threatening anaphylaxis event within 60 days of study entry and those 
with severe or uncontrolled asthma were excluded from the studies.  
The screening DBPCFC for ARC003 was not to exceed 100 mg peanut protein (144 mg cumulative) 
leading to inclusion of more sensitive patients with peanut allergy than for ARC010, for which the 
screening DBPCFC was not to exceed 300 mg peanut protein (444 mg cumulative). The applicant 
stated that the enhancement to 300mg was chosen to allow subjects representative of the broader 
population with peanut allergy to enroll and because threshold levels for allergic reactions can vary 
day to day, the ARC010 screening DBPCFC criterion ensured that subjects with borderline sensitivity 
to 100 mg peanut protein were included..  
The CHMP considered that the screening DBPCFC for ARC003 and ARC010 were acceptable. 
The key measure of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of Palforzia treatment, was the level of 
desensitization to peanut protein after a defined interval of study treatment, determined by the 
tolerated doses of peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms in a DBPCFC. In the pivotal 
studies ARC003 and ARC010, tolerability of a single dose of 1000 mg peanut protein (2043 mg 
cumulative; approximately 3-4 peanuts) with no more than mild symptoms at the exit DBPCFC was 
assessed as the primary efficacy endpoint. Additionally, the threshold sensitivity to peanut for an 
individual of challenge doses of 300 mg, 600 mg, and 1000 mg peanut protein were analysed. Other 
secondary endpoints included the maximum severity score and use of epinephrine during the exit 
DBPCFC and immunomodulatory markers such as peanut specific-IgE, IgG4, IgE-IgG4 ratio, and 
peanut specific skin prick test (SPT) wheal size. The DBPCFCs were conducted in accordance with the 
international recommended PRACTALL guidelines35, with modifications to include a 600 mg dose 
(between 300 mg and 1000 mg). Choice of primary and key secondary endpoints, including standard 
efficacy variables being different in Europe and North America, are considered adequate by the CHMP 
and in line with the objectives of the studies. 
The dosing regimen used in both phase 3 studies ARC003 and ARC010 was based on the regimen 
used in the phase 2 studies (please see also above ‘Dose response studies’). Single-day initial dose 
escalation of Palforzia at low doses (0.5 mg up to 6 mg) was followed by up-dosing from 3 mg/day to 
the 300 mg/day dose with dose escalation every 2 weeks, and maintenance at 300 mg/day for 
approximately 3 months (ARC010) or 6 months (ARC003). The tolerability of single challenge doses of 
peanut protein or placebo from 3 mg to 1000 mg was evaluated in an exit DBPCFC to determine the 
level of peanut desensitisation reached by the subject. Patients should continue the standard peanut 
avoidance while participating in the study. Elaborate instructions concerning dose-modifications in 
case of intercurrent illness, presence of co-factors (e.g. exercise, menstruation, stress, fatigue, sleep 
deprivation or intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or alcohol), and missed consecutive 
doses apply due to the risk of serious allergic reactions.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose-finding studies 
During the evaluation, CHMP questioned if differences in the timing schedule of Palforzia 
administration (including a more prolonged and slower up-dosing or a prolonged maintenance period), 
or a lower maintenance dose (< 300 mg) might have the same clinical effect but probably less side

effects. The applicant responded that although a small study33 suggested that slower up-dosing may 
lead to fewer adverse events leading to study discontinuation, while eventually reaching 
desensitisation, the study was small and there are no robust evidence of efficacy and safety for a 
slower up-dosing and lower maintenance doses. The applicant also said that the option of a lower 
maintenance dose was not considered because no Palforzia phase 2 data or published data were 
available to support reaching clinically relevant levels of desensitisation at daily maintenance doses of 
less than 300 mg or equivalent protein content of approximately 1 peanut kernel. With regard to a 
non-daily maintenance dosing schedule, the applicant referred to the completed follow-on study 
ARC004 which suggests that non-daily maintenance dosing appears not to be as effective as daily 
dosing in maintaining clinically relevant efficacy. In addition, a lower incidence of treatment-related 
adverse events was reported with daily maintenance dosing compared with non-daily dosing 
regimens. As a consequence, the importance of daily dosing is added in section 4.2 the SmPC and it is 
highlighted that treatment interruption can potentially lead to increased adverse events. Furthermore, 
appropriate dose modification instructions are included in the product information allowing the 
physician to temporary modify the dose of Palforzia for patients who experience allergic reactions 
during up-dosing or maintenance or for practical reasons for patient management.  
CHMP agreed with the approach taken (see also ‘Dose response studies’ section 2.5.1. ). 
Efficacy data from pivotal studies and additional analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint (percentage of patients tolerating a single dose of 1000 mg peanut 
protein in DBPCFC at study end) was met in studies ARC003 and ARC010. Treatment with Palforzia in 
the ITT population (4-17 years) resulted in statistically significant treatment effects over placebo, with 
treatment differences of 47.8% (p < 0.0001) in ARC003 and 56.0% (p < 0.0001) in ARC010. In the 
completer population of subjects aged 4 to 17 years, the proportion of subjects who tolerated a single 
dose of 1000 mg peanut protein at the exit DBPCFC with no more than mild symptoms was 63.2% for 
Palforzia-treated subjects in ARC003 and 72.6% in ARC010. 
Significant treatment effects of Palforzia compared with placebo were also observed for key secondary 
endpoints of desensitisation response and maximum severity of symptoms for subjects aged 4 to 17 
years. In addition, further supportive and sensitivity subgroup analyses as well as sensitivity analyses 
using predefined analysis populations and worst-case imputation methods supported the results. The 
proportion of subjects in the completer population who tolerated a single dose of 600 mg and 300 mg 
peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms were 84.5% and 96.3%, respectively in ARC003, 
and 84.9% and 91.5%, respectively, in ARC010. Nevertheless, it was noted that a considerable 
number of patients (20-35% in ARC010) could not tolerate a single dose of 300 mg peanut protein 
(although on maintenance) and continuing treatment in this subgroup of patients may not be 
reasonable. Initial dose escalation is administered on a single day under the supervision of a health 
care professional in a health care setting with the ability to manage potentially severe allergic 
reactions, including anaphylaxis. Treatment must be discontinued if symptoms requiring medical 
intervention (e.g., use of adrenaline) occur with any dose during initial dose escalation. Allergic 
reactions, including gastrointestinal reactions, that are severe, recurrent, bothersome, or last longer 
than 90 minutes during up-dosing or maintenance should be actively managed with dose 
modifications. Clinical judgment should be used to determine the best course of action on a patient by 
patient basis. This is adequately reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
In addition, the maximum severity of symptoms at any challenge dose during the exit DBPCFC for 
subjects aged 4 to 17 years in the ITT populations of ARC003 and ARC010 was reduced in the Palforzia 
group compared with placebo. In ARC003, the maximum severity of symptoms among treated subjects 
was no symptoms (37.6% Palforzia, 2.4% placebo), mild symptoms (32.0%, 28.2%), moderate 
symptoms (25.3%, 58.9%), and severe symptoms (5.1%, 10.5%). In ARC010, the maximum severity 
Assessment report  
Page 61/62 
 
 
  
 
of symptoms was no symptoms (35.6% Palforzia, 0% placebo), mild symptoms (41.7%, 37.2%), 
moderate symptoms (18.2%, 46.5%), and severe symptoms (4.5%, 16.3%).  
At the request of CHMP, additional paediatric subgroups analyses in the ITT population were 
performed by geographic region (Europe, North America), by age group (4-11 years, 12-17 years), 
and by region and age group (Europe 4-11 years, 12-17 years; North America 4-11 years, 12-17 
years) for the primary efficacy endpoint for ARC003 and ARC010 studies.  
For ARC003, all performed supportive analyses to the primary efficacy endpoint were consistent with 
the overall ITT results, except the supportive analysis for the Europe region in the 12 to 17 years age 
group, which was not statistically significant (tolerated 1000 mg peanut protein: 55.6% Palforzia, 
33.3% placebo; treatment difference, 22.2% [95% CI: -37.3, 81.7]; p = 0.4642). This could be 
explained due to low numbers of participants in the EU region (27 vs 3).  
For ARC010, treatment differences (Palforzia-placebo) were consistent with the primary efficacy 
endpoint for the regional populations by country in countries that enrolled a sufficient number of 
subjects. Subgroup analyses by age group (4-11 years, 12-17 years) for the primary efficacy endpoint 
were also consistent with the overall ITT results; however, the treatment difference was less, but still 
statistically significant for the smaller age group of 12 to 17 years. Among patients aged 4-11 years, 
52-60% tolerated 1000 mg peanut protein, while 45-46% patients aged 12-17 years and 34% of 
patients aged 18-55 years met this endpoint at the exit DBPCFC.  
In order to further characterise the populations, who might profit most, the applicant was asked to 
provide further efficacy data comparing highly allergic individuals with less allergic patients by 
subdividing patients by degree of severity in peanut-allergic individuals in several subgroups including 
specific sensitisation levels and baseline food challenge results, as well as age and patients history. 
Performed analysis according to age revealed that both studies showed robust efficacy data for 
included subjects aged 4-17 years. From these, a higher response rates in younger children, aged 4-
11 years (52.5% in ARC003 and 62.9% in ARC010) versus older children, aged 12-17 years (46.3% in 
ARC003 and 45.7% in ARC010) was observed. Interestingly, the highest response rate (62.9%) was 
reached in children aged 4-11 years in the European only study ARC010, although their treatment 
maintenance phase was half as long as in ARC003. This may be associated with slightly different 
inclusion criteria (leading to “some less sensitive subjects” being included), but it may also support 
the impact of “age”, as included children were slightly younger in ARC010 (median 8 years). By 
performing the descriptive sub analyses according to subgroups as defined by IgE, SPT, and DBPCFC, 
younger, less sensitive subjects, seem to develop the best efficacy rates. However, these descriptive 
post-hoc sub analysis can only be considered exploratory, as the studies were not designed to 
investigate such subgroups. In addition, especially in the age group of 12-17 years, sample sizes are 
too small to enable persistent conclusions.  
Key secondary efficacy endpoints were met in hierarchical order for the ITT population (subjects aged 
4-17 years) in ARC003 and in ARC010, thus key secondary endpoint in study ARC003 for subjects 
aged 18 to 55 years was not met.  
A subgroup analysis in patients who turned age 18 years during Palforzia treatment was also 
performed as the proposed indication recommends that Palforzia may be continued in patients 18 
years of age and older. As the initially submitted data in this subgroup was small, the applicant 
provided an updated data set and reported 51 patients which were enrolled at age ≤ 17 years and 
subsequently turned age 18 during treatment with Palforzia (enrolled in different studies: ARC003, 
ARC010, ARC0101 respectively in follow-on studies ARC004 and ARC008). From these 51 patients 
nearly two-thirds of the subjects who turned age 18 during Palforzia treatment (33 subjects, 64.7%) 
remain ongoing in the follow-on study ARC008. The response rate of Palforzia treated subjects who 
turned 18 years whilst participating in a study and tolerated a single highest dose of at least 1,000 mg 
Assessment report  
Page 62/63 
 
 
  
 
peanut protein with no more than mild allergic symptoms at the exit DBPCFC (15/27, 55.6%) was 
consistent with the overall primary efficacy of the subjects aged 4 to 17 years. 
CHMP noted the results and agreed that Palforzia may be continued in patients 18 years of age and 
older.  
The analysis of other secondary efficacy endpoints documented that treatment with Palforzia 
decreased the need for epinephrine use as rescue medication during the peanut challenge at the exit 
DBPCFC compared with the screening DBPCFC. For subjects aged 4 to 17 years who completed the 
peanut challenge day of the exit DBPCFC (completer population), no subject in either treatment group 
used epinephrine as rescue medication during the placebo challenge day of the screening DBPCFC and 
a similar proportion of subjects in each treatment group (ARC003: 36.1% AR101, 37.1% placebo; 
ARC010: 20.8% AR101, 20.0% placebo) used epinephrine as rescue medication during the peanut 
challenge day. The higher proportion of subjects with epinephrine use during the screening DBPCFC in 
ARC003 compared with ARC010 may be due to different rates of epinephrine use in Europe compared 
with North America. During the peanut challenge day of the exit DBPCFC, epinephrine was used as 
rescue medication in 9.5% of Palforzia-treated subjects and 53.4% of placebo-treated subjects in 
ARC003, and 2.8% of Palforzia-treated subjects and 17.5% of placebo-treated subjects in ARC010.  
Overall, CHMP considered that the presented data are endorsed, statistically significant, and 
consistent.  
With regard to duration of treatment, the applicant presented first data which indicates, that a 
prolonged maintenance treatment with Palforzia seems to maintain or even further increase efficacy, 
determined by DBPCFC (with a data set of n=104 subjects). Participants (originated from ARC003 
enrolled in the follow-on study ARC004) were treated for in total approximately 18 months (580.5 
days; range, 388-761 days). From these 104 subjects, 83 (79.8%) tolerated at least 1000 mg peanut 
protein (2043 mg cumulative) at the ARC004 exit DBPCFC. The data is supported by immunological 
data including a further decrease of specific IgE and increase of specific IgG4 as well as decrease in 
Mean (SD) skin prick test mean wheal diameter. Meanwhile efficacy data from the follow-on study 
ARC004 that extended the maintenance period of the ARC003 showed that efficacy were maintained 
or improved in a large proportion of subjects. Patients have been followed for a maximum of two 
years (n=26) by the latest cut-off date: after 18 months maintenance, n=21 from 26 subjects 
tolerated 2000 mg at exit DBPCFC, and n= 25% tolerated 1000 mg peanut protein at the Exit 
DBPCFC.  
CHMP noted that in group 1 (former placebo treated subjects), only 55 of 102 subjects (53.9%) 
completed the study. The applicant further confirmed this observation and argued that the long 
treatment phase may be responsible for high discontinuation rate. CHMP accepted this explanation. 
Current clinical data (2 years) for ongoing treatment with Palforzia is regarded as consistent with 
demonstration of a “sustained clinical effect” as described in the CHMP guideline “Guideline on the 
Clinical Development of Products for Specific Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Allergic Diseases” 
(CHMP/EWP/18504/06). The SmPC has been updated to include that efficacy data are currently 
available for up to 24 months of treatment with Palforzia and no recommendation can be made about 
the duration of treatment beyond 24 months. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. The effect of 
stopping treatment on maintenance of clinical efficacy or the effect on a potential disease modification 
has not been evaluated. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC and it is recommended that if 
treatment with Palforzia is stopped, patients must continue to carry self-injectable adrenaline at all 
times. Furthermore, treatment with Palforzia should be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant 
diet. In addition the applicant will collect further data to support sustained clinical effect and long-term 
efficacy (potential disease modification) within the open-label extension study ARC008 listed in the 
RMP. With this, the applicant follows the recommendation of the CHMP to propose a protocol to ensure 
Assessment report  
Page 63/64 
 
 
  
 
the collection of sufficient data to clarify the long-term efficacy and safety in Palforzia treated patients, 
who end treatment with Palforzia after 5 years or earlier. The applicant has clarified how 
discontinuation rates, immunological markers and long-term efficacy will be assessed in study ARC008, 
which will be extended to 5 years treatment + 12 month follow-up.  
Regarding quality of life, in study ARC003 treatment with Palforzia resulted in similar values at exit as 
baseline measured by subject and parent reported FAQLQ and FAIM. This result reflects other 
literature data on this topic. A meaningful change in QoL aspects needs more time than the study 
duration of ARC003 to be adequately assessed. Indeed, many subjects experienced an improvement 
in tolerated amount of peanut protein; however, they were still blinded and did not “experience” real 
life situations. In the follow-up study ARC004, patient-reported outcomes indicated improved quality 
of life with longer-term treatment. Quality of life measured by subject and FAQLQ and FAIM exceeded 
the minimal clinically important differences in several domains related to disease-specific aspects.  
With regard to compliance, there was a clear age effect in treatment compliance (PP population) with 
85% completers in the 4-11 year age group, 69% completers in the 12-17 year age group, and 48% 
of (the relatively few) patients aged 18-55 years (ARC003) completing the studies. It is acknowledged 
that with a complex dosing regimen and potential for significant adverse events patient compliance, in 
particular in adolescents, may not be 100%. Careful selection and appropriate education of adolescent 
patients will be required to ensure compliance with the treatment and the necessary precautions. The 
section 4.2 of the SmPC highlight the importance of a daily maintenance treatment to maintain the 
tolerability and clinical effects of Palforzia. In addition, healthcare professional and patient/caregiver 
educational materials and a patient card have been put in place to provide education and counselling 
regarding the appropriate use, adverse reactions and their management, and when to seek medical 
care (see also clinical safety discussion 2.6.1. ). 
CHMP agreed that treatment with Palforzia requires an active participation and a shared-decision 
making between patients (and families) and the treating physician and may not be suitable for all 
patients allergic to peanut. 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The design and conduct of the 2 phase 3 clinical studies (ARC003 and ARC010) as well as the number 
of patients with peanut allergy included in the clinical program (496 in ARC003 and 175 in ARC010) is 
considered adequate for the analysis of clinical efficacy.  
The 2 phase 3 studies met their primary and key secondary endpoint, i.e. significantly higher number 
of patients in the Palforzia groups, who tolerated 1000 mg, 600 mg, and 300 mg peanut protein at the 
exit DBPCFC, as compared to the placebo groups. These outcomes were confirmed by supportive 
subgroup as well as sensitivity analyses.  
Overall, a favorable treatment effect in the indicated age group of 4-17 years of age has been shown 
by several endpoints, statistically robust and clinically relevant. Patients who keep up the treatment up 
to and throughout the maintenance phase showed a very convincing increase in their individual 
threshold of reactivity against peanut protein. Therefore, patients treated with Palforzia may continue 
the treatment when they become 18 years of age and older. The limited data on quality of life 
substantiate that this effect is clinically relevant and may reduce stress and anxiety connected with 
peanut allergy. Efficacy data are currently available for up to 24 months of treatment with Palforzia 
and no recommendation can be made about the duration of treatment beyond 24 months. The effect of 
stopping treatment on maintenance of clinical efficacy or on disease modification has not been 
evaluated and further data on sustained clinical effect will be collected in the study ARC008.  
Assessment report

In conclusion, the CHMP considered that the data submitted support the following indication:  
“Palforzia is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 4 to 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of 
peanut allergy. Palforzia may be continued in patients 18 years of age and older. 
Palforzia should be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet.” 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile of Palforzia in patients with peanut allergy is derived from 5 clinical studies involving 
944 subjects aged 4 to 17 years who received at least 1 dose of Palforzia:  
•  Three completed, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies, ARC003 (Europe 
and North America), ARC007 (North America only), and ARC010 (Europe only); 
•  Two ongoing, uncontrolled, follow-on studies, ARC004 and ARC011 (data cut-off date 15 Dec 
2018) 
Patient exposure 
Controlled Population:  
In the combined controlled population, 841 subjects were treated with Palforzia and 335 subjects were 
treated with placebo from the 3 controlled studies (ARC003, ARC007, ARC010). 
During initial dose escalation, subjects in both treatment groups were treated for a median of 2.0 days. 
During up-dosing, 818 subjects in the Palforzia group were treated for a median of 154.0 days (22 
weeks) and 332 subjects in the placebo group were treated for a median of 149.0 days. The 
maintenance dose of 300 mg/day was reached by 83.4% of subjects in the Palforzia group and 95.5% 
of subjects in the placebo group. 
In study ARC010 at 300 mg/day, 108 subjects in the Palforzia group were treated for a median of 
103.5 days (approximately 15 weeks).  
In study ARC003 at 300 mg/day, 310 subjects in the Palforzia group were treated for a median of 
175.0 days (25 weeks).

Integrated Safety Population:  
In the integrated safety population, 944 subjects were treated with Palforzia that make up the 
population of all treated subjects from the 5 studies (ARC003, ARC007, ARC010, ARC004, ARC011).  
Among the 944 unique individuals exposed to Palforzia, 770 patients were exposed to the target dose 
of Palforzia 300 mg/day for a mean of approximately nine months (310 patients were exposed for a 
mean of approximately six months to Palforzia during the controlled study phase). The exposure is 
summarised in Table 11.

Demographics 
The included patient population was representative of the peanut allergic population. The 
demographics were balanced between the Palforzia and placebo groups. The majority of patients were 
aged between 4 and 17 years of age, which is the target population. Generally, more boys are included 
in peanut OIT studies in the literature; this is also noted for the Palforzia programme.

During up-dosing the incidence of AEs of any severity was more pronounced compared to initial dose 
escalation and daily dosing.  
Interestingly, placebo treated patients complained in comparable amounts of TEAEs (including severity 
of AEs), than Palforzia treated subjects (ARC003; Controlled Population, Table 14: 48% of placebo 
subjects complained about mild reactions, 31% about moderate reactions; Palforzia group: 52% mild 
and 33% moderate AEs). In the Palforzia group 51.3% AEs were related to the study product, but only 
22.6% of AEs in the placebo group. AEs related to study products were announced in 56.7% (placebo) 
and 88.6% (Palforzia) during IDE and up-dosing.  
In the integrated safety population overall 11.4% of subjects had 1 or more AEs that led to study 
product discontinuation. This was higher during up-dosing (8.7%) than initial dose escalation (2.1%) 
and all 300 mg/day dosing (1.2%). 
In the controlled population 10.9% Palforzia and 2.4% placebo group subjects had one or more AEs 
leading to study product discontinuation during initial dose escalation and up-dosing combined. In the 
Palforzia group, 4 subjects (1.3%) discontinued study product due to 1 or more adverse events during 
300 mg/day dosing in ARC003 and 0 in ARC010. In the placebo group, no subject discontinued study 
product due to 1 or more adverse events during 300 mg/day dosing in ARC003 or ARC010.  
Treatment-Related Adverse Events: 
With regard to common adverse events, both safety populations (controlled and integrated) showed a 
comparable adverse event profile. In the controlled population, the most common adverse events  
(≥20% of subjects) during initial dose escalation and up-dosing combined with incidence at least 5% 
higher over the placebo group in decreasing order were abdominal pain, throat irritation, pruritus, 
vomiting, nausea, cough, urticaria, upper abdominal pain, oral pruritus, abdominal discomfort, and 
sneezing. In the integrated safety population, the most common adverse events (≥20% of subjects) 
during up-dosing were abdominal pain, throat irritation, vomiting, cough, nausea, pruritus, urticaria, 
upper abdominal pain, oral pruritis, headache, abdominal discomfort, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and upper 
respiratory tract infection. During 300 mg/day maintenance treatment in the integrated safety 
population, cough and urticaria were the only events that reached at least 20% incidence, and urticaria 
was the only event to reach 20% incidence in Palforzia-treated subjects during maintenance in the 
ARC010 and ARC003 controlled populations (abdominal pain and pruritus were > 20% in ARC010). 
Abdominal pain was described in the highest rates during up-dosing Palforzia 415 (49.3%), Placebo 59 
(17.6%). Although reducing to 3.4% - 9% during maintenance, (Table 15, abdominal pain is still

present. Especially while focusing on eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, this should be further 
reviewed in the post-authorisation safety study ARC008 (safety discussion in 2.6.1. ). 
Adverse events over time:  
There seemed to be a decrease in the proportions of subjects with the most common adverse events 
over time from the first 0 to 13 weeks to > 52 weeks of 300 mg/day dosing. The proportions of 
subjects with any adverse event decreased over time during 300 mg/day dosing from 76.4% for 0 to 
13 weeks to 50.8% for > 52 weeks (Table 19). The amount of “subjects with at least 1 AE related to 
study product” even decreased from 46.9% for 0 to 13 weeks to 19.3% for > 52 weeks.  However 
anaphylactic reactions (as a Treatment-related AE) occurred in 3 – 4.3% rather constantly during  300 
mg/day dosing – rather independently from time (Table 15).

Summary includes all adverse events with at least 5% incidence overall. 
The anaphylactic reaction preferred term includes systemic allergic reactions of any severity, including 
anaphylaxis (severe). 
To further follow the assumption of the applicant, that the number of allergic reactions over time 
decrease, a requested presentation of a tabular comparison with the number of systemic allergic 
reactions per year and per year during lifetime before study start is presented for ARC003 (Table 16). 
Considering limitations like pre-study estimates are based on self-reported history baseline data in 
ARC003 show comparable rates. But rates increased after treatment – indicating an enhancement of 
allergic reactions induced by treatment (and not by accidental reactions, co-factors or others, as the 
rate in the placebo group is lower). Another analysis (please see Section Serious Adverse Events) 
documents, that the incidence of systemic allergic reactions did not appear to decrease over the course

of the individual studies, neither did the severity of the systemic allergic reactions appear to change

Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders: 
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) was diagnosed in 5 of 944 subjects (0.5% overall) in the controlled and 
integrated safety populations. EoE was considered treatment related in 3 of the subjects (0.3% 
overall). The severity of EoE was considered mild in 2 subjects (0.2%), moderate in 2 subjects (0.2%), 
and severe in 1 subject (0.1%). All 5 subjects with EoE discontinued from the study. 
Outside of the integrated safety population, 7 additional subjects had a diagnosis of EoE: 2 subjects in 
the phase 2 studies ARC001 and ARC002, 1 adult subject in study ARC004, and 4 subjects in study 
ARC008 (3 subjects with grade 2 moderate and one subject with severity unknown).

Serious adverse events 
It appears that not all cases of e.g. anaphylaxis or EoE were reported/summarised as related serious 
adverse events. The related adverse events as judged by the applicant (although without a 
justification) are shown in the Table 18 and comprised, among others, four cases of anaphylaxis and 
one case of asthma.

The anaphylactic reaction preferred term includes systemic allergic reactions of any severity, including anaphylaxis 
(severe).   
Shading indicates subjects with events that were considered treatment related (not carried to overall column).   
No subject had a serious adverse event during initial dose escalation. 
[1] 
Only 1 subject’s asthma was considered treatment related.   
Additionally, when focusing on AEs Grade ≥ 3 severity, hardly any placebo reactions occurred. In 
n=818 Palforzia treated subjects, gastrointestinal disorders had been reported the most (1.1%). In this 
analysis of the controlled population, AEs occurred especially during up-dosing and not during 
maintenance therapy. 
Furthermore, in the integrated safety population, (AEs Grade ≥3 severity), anaphylactic reaction had 
been reported in 0.8% during maintenance, but in 0.4% during up-dosing.  
GI disorders (AEs Grade ≥ 3 severity) occurred mainly during up-dosing (1.0 %), but had not been 
reported during maintenance.

Data for systemic allergic reactions (MedDRA preferred term anaphylactic reaction) were reanalysed in 
consistent 13-week (i.e, quarter-annual) intervals out to 78 weeks, and were provided in response to 
the day 120 LOQ: Incidence of systemic allergic reactions did not appear to decrease over the course 
of the individual studies, neither did the severity of the systemic allergic reactions appear to change 
over the treatment course.  
This observation is further supported in the day 180 responses: There is no indication that systemic 
allergic reactions decrease over time during up-dosing or maintenance.  
The likelihood of developing a systemic allergic reaction is not associated with a certain study period. 
Severe allergic reactions were rare during treatment, independent from study period. 
The performance of an exposure-adjusted event rate for anaphylaxis for treatment phases is as 
follows:

Denominators for percentages of subjects with ≥ 1 systemic allergic reaction were based on the number of subjects within each treatment group who were at risk during the 
corresponding study period.   
[1]  The 3-point European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) grading scale was used for grading the severity of anaphylactic reactions.

Four subjects experienced anaphylaxis during up-dosing. All 6 subjects who developed anaphylaxis 
during maintenance experienced their symptoms after more than 40 weeks of treatment (starting 
study day 284).  
According the applicant, eight of the 10 subjects who experienced anaphylaxis had potential cofactors 
like exercise and non-specific viral infections. 
Laboratory findings 
Generally, shifts in blood cell counts from baseline level to worst post-baseline level occurred rarely. 
However, a decrease of white blood cell (WBC) among 9% of Palforzia treated patients vs. 6% of 
placebo patients, an increase of eosinophils 15% Palforzia vs. 11% placebo, and a decrease of 
neutrophils 7% Palforzia vs. 4% placebo were noted. There were no clinically relevant differences 
between Palforzia treated patients and patients in the placebo group with regard to vital signs, lung 
function tests, and asthma control test.

Safety in special populations 
The current application is limited to children 4-17 years of age and adolescents turning 18 years of age 
during treatment. Currently there are only limited data on adults (see below), and no data on elderly 
patients.  
The data gained so far suspect a higher efficacy and better safety for younger individuals. 
Children: 
The presented results regarding TEAEs by subject age group and sex support this assumptions (Table 
22): “In the integrated safety population overall, a higher proportion of subjects aged 4 to 11 years 
had mild adverse events compared with subjects aged 12 to 17 years (42.2% vs 33.8%) and a lower 
proportion had moderate (53.5% vs 59.2%) and severe (3.0% vs 5.8%) adverse events.  A lower 
proportion of subjects aged 4 to 11 years had adverse events of systemic allergic reaction (11.9% vs 
21.9%), and of 10 subjects with severe systemic allergic reaction (anaphylaxis, Table 41), 4 were in 
the 4 to 11 year age group. 
Likewise study TEAEs leading to study product discontinuation are with 13.8% vs 10.2% higher in the 
older population (11-17 years of age). 
Similar observation had been made for the controlled population.

•  History versus no history of allergic reaction to peanut (note, data on the severity of prior

In the descriptive analysis trends have been noticed in all treatment phases in the treatment group 
indicating that expressed as a percentage, most systemic allergic reactions occurred in the age 
population of 12-17 year old subjects with higher ps-IgE levels (≥ Q2 to < Q3 and ≥ Q3). The analysis 
suggests, that these reactions stay present although patients received the maintenance phase (20-30 
% of older subjects with ≥ 1 event in ARC003 and ARC010 during maintenance). Epinephrine episodes 
have been depicted especially in IDE and Up-dosing and maintenance of treated subjects. In subjects 
aged 12-17, these were nearly all indicated with a binary amount of events. Thus high allergic subjects 
were also those patients who discontinued during IDE or Up-dosing.) 
Descriptive subanalysis (post-hoc) of study safety data of ARC003 and ARC010 have been presented – 
however, valid statistical conclusions may not be drawn. Focusing on safety, higher rates of systemic 
allergic reaction and epinephrine use have been observed in adolescent subjects and those with higher 
baseline IgE levels. Patients aged 12-17 experienced twice as many systemic allergic reactions 
including anaphylaxis than patients aged 4-11 years; 21.9% [95% CI: 17.3, 26.5%] vs. 11.9% (95% 
CI: 9.4, 14.4 %). In addition, 7/311 adolescents (2%) as compared to 3/630 patients younger than 11 
years (0.5%) experienced anaphylaxis. These observations cannot (only) be explained by a more risk-
prone behavior in teenagers as teenagers in the placebo-arm did not experience these events. Most 
systemic allergic reactions occurred during IDE and up-dosing, however, also during maintenance the 
risk of a systemic allergic reaction was approx. 10 times higher in the treatment arms than the placebo 
arms. Within responses at day 180 responses the applicant presented further analysis and 
“acknowledges that the incidence of systemic allergic reactions increases in adolescents and adults 
over younger children”, please see Table 23 (including data from ARC003, ARC010 and in addition 
from ARC007):

For all binary response endpoints and populations analyzed at day 180 responses, the majority of odds 
ratio point estimates are less than 2.0, though trends (ie, where OR > 2.0) suggest that older age (12-
17 years vs 4-11 years) and increasing baseline levels of ps-IgE Ara h 2 may be more likely to be 
associated with these events: systemic allergic reactions, epinephrine use, and discontinuation from 
study due to persistent GI adverse events. In general, these results are remarkably clear, and the 
applicant confirms that a consistent pattern of predictors can be observed. In particular, treatment 
remains the strongest predictor of adverse events, after adjustment. Further, the applicant confirms 
that age ≥12 years consistently shows an association with higher odds for adverse events. Similarly, 
high baseline levels of ps-IgE Ara h 2 are associated with increased risk of adverse events. 
Results suggest that Log10 ps-IgE/IgG4 ratio and ps-IgE Ara h 3 may also be predictive for Systemic 
Allergic Reactions and Epinephrine use, while an association of ps-IgE Ara h 9 and SPT with the odds 
for discontinuation due to GI adverse events was observed. 
Subjects who turned 18 years during treatment: 
The data of subjects who turned age 18 years during treatment with Palforzia is very limited. Only 8 
subjects treated with Palforzia (4 with placebo). The safety profile of subjects who turned age 18 years 
during treatment in an Palforzia clinical study is consistent with the overall population of subjects aged 
4 to 17 years. The applicant added supportive safety data from n=55 subjects ages 18-55 years 
(median age 23.0 years). From these population, seven subjects (17.1%) of Palforzia group (n=41) 
discontinued study product due to 1 or more events. 
This discontinuation rate is higher than the discontinuation rate of younger patients, where 11.4% of 
subjects had 1 or more adverse events that led to study product discontinuation (controlled 
population). (Integrated population discontinuation 10.6%) 
In both age subsets the discontinuation was higher during up-dosing than initial dose escalation and all 
300 mg/day dosing.  
Please see chapter “Discontinuations due to AEs” below.

ARC003, was consistent with the pattern observed in paediatric subjects aged 4 to 17 years. GI 
disorders and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders were the most common system organ 
classes overall, and exposure-adjusted event rates generally decreased from up-dosing to 
maintenance. No adult subject had a grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse event, but 1 Palforzia-
treated subject had a non-serious treatment-related severe symptom of urticaria during up-dosing. 
Two Palforzia-treated subjects and 1 placebo-treated subject had a serious adverse event, all during 
maintenance: 1 subject discontinued due to a moderate systemic allergic reaction considered 
treatment related and 1 subject continued study treatment after an event of severe syncope 
considered not related to study product. One placebo-treated subject had severe cutaneous vasculitis 
and continued study treatment. Eight Palforzia-treated subjects (19.5%) and 1 placebo-treated subject 
(7.1%) had 1 or more systemic allergic reactions; 2 of these subjects discontinued study treatment. 
Other discontinuations were primarily due to GI adverse events and symptoms during up-dosing. No 
adult subject experienced a severe systemic allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or had a diagnosis of EoE. 
Other intrinsic factors 
Patients who previously experienced a systemic allergic reaction to peanut were more likely to 
experience a systemic allergic reaction. There were no differences in safety profile between patients 
with or without a history of atopic dermatitis 
Pregnancy 
Patients were required to avoid pregnancy during the studies. Hence, there are no data to clarify the 
benefits and risks of continuing treatment during pregnancy, e.g. if the tolerance to Palforzia changes 
during pregnancy. However, with life-long therapy it is expected that approximately half of the 
included population would ultimately have to decide whether or not to continue treatment during 
pregnancy.  
Potential symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis and systemic allergic reactions in pregnancy include 
intense itching in the vulvar and vaginal areas, low back pain, uterine cramps, foetal distress, and 
preterm labour36. Anaphylaxis can cause a dangerous decrease in blood pressure, which could result in 
compromised placental perfusion and significant risk to a foetus during pregnancy. In addition, the 
effect of Palforzia on the immune system of the mother and foetus during pregnancy is unknown.  
Use during pregnancy will be further characterised in a post-marketing pregnancy registry that will 
collect data on reports of exposure to Palforzia during pregnancy (see 2.6.1. safety discussion). 
Overdose, drug abuse, withdrawal and rebound 
Overdose may be associated with allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Drug abuse is not expected.  
Study ARC004 addresses other application schedules of Palforzia than the daily schedule used in the 
presented studies. The final CSR ARC004 (finalised 14 Feb 2020) was submitted with the responses to 
the day 120 list of questions. First experiences with a small subset of subjects (ARC004), suggest, that 
the daily consumption of Palforzia is in favor, compared to a non-daily schedule. 
So far no data is known, which addresses a possible re-Bound effect in patients who discontinued 
treatment.  
When Palforzia treatment is discontinued an increased severity of allergic reactions (i.e. rebound) upon 
exposure to peanut could possibly occur compared with the severity of allergic reactions before or 
during treatment. The applicant considered that this is very unlikely due to the competitive inhibition

by IgG4 of antigen binding to IgE37,38,39 and that the effects of IgE elevation have not been observed 
to result in rebound or exacerbated effects after discontinuation of treatment. For patients who 
discontinued the clinical studies early, no systemic allergic reaction events, accidental exposures to 
peanut, or other important safety events were reported in any of the follow-up periods. A search of the 
published literature found no reports that suggest an increased risk of increased severity of reactions 
(i.e. rebound) following discontinuation of food OIT at any point during the process. 
As there are no data which address a possible rebound effect in patient, who discontinued treatment, 
CHMP considered that possible rebound effect should be monitored in the follow-on open-label ARC008 
study listed in the RMP (please see  2.6.1.  safety discussion). 
The applicant summarised Key Study Conclusions as follows: 
Safety profile: A lower incidence of treatment-related adverse events was reported with QD 
maintenance dosing compared with nondaily dosing regimens. Overall, the safety profile was 
predictable and manageable by the subject or caregiver.   
•  All systemic allergic reactions in this study were nonserious and most were mild or moderate in 
severity, occurred within 2 hours after Palforzia dosing, and were manageable by the subject or 
caregiver with available medications.  Five subjects (2.4%) in group 2 (2 in cohort 1 and 3 in 
cohort 3C) experienced a severe systemic allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) during QD dosing; 
4 continued Palforzia treatment and completed the study. 
•  The use of dosing intervals longer than QD dosing with Palforzia was not well characterised due 
to the small numbers of subjects treated and relatively shorter exposure periods in nondaily 
dosing cohorts.  While no specific safety concerns were noted with nondaily dosing, efficacy 
data from the DBPCFCs (response rates, single highest tolerated dose, maximum severity of 
symptoms) indicated that during the first 1 to 2 years of treatment, an overall trend toward 
favoring QD dosing to maintain or improve the effectiveness of desensitization.   
•  Treatment-related adverse events during continuing Palforzia maintenance treatment were 
readily manageable, mild or moderate allergic reactions. Throat irritation was the most 
common event during QD dosing overall (approximately 10% of subjects) and throat irritation 
and nausea were the most common events during nondaily dosing overall (approximately 20% 
in cohort 2 overall).  The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was generally higher 
during BIW dosing than QD dosing.   
•  After adjusting for exposure, oral pruritus and throat irritation were the most frequent 
treatment-related adverse events during QD dosing overall, and throat irritation, upper 
abdominal pain, and oral pruritus were the most frequent treatment-related adverse events 
during nondaily dosing (cohort 2 overall).  When adjusted for duration of exposure, 
treatment-related adverse events were generally more frequent during BIW dosing than QD 
dosing.   
•  The incidence of serious adverse events was low, and no subject had a treatment-related 
serious adverse event.  No subject had a treatment-related life-threatening adverse event or 
died during the study.

•  Severe adverse events and symptoms were infrequent, manageable, and resulted in no 
adverse sequelae.   
•  Epinephrine use did not correlate with the severity of the adverse events for which it was 
administered, and most events with epinephrine use required a single dose.   
•  EoE continues to be an important identified risk of peanut OIT and Palforzia treatment.  
Nonserious EoE was reported in 2 subjects (0.6%) aged 4 to 17 years and 1 subject (3.3%) 
aged 18 to 55 years.  Severity was moderate for 1 subject and severe for 2 subjects (1 during 
up-dosing, not related to Palforzia).  Symptoms resolved during follow-up after discontinuation 
of Palforzia.   
In all the small number of participants is to be considered. 
Immunological events 
For this drug product the immunomodulatory effect is the treatment effect. No undesired 
immunological events occurred. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No potential drug or food interactions with Palforzia are known. Palforzia is intended to be taken with 
food, mixed in a soft food matrix for dosing. 
The concomitant use of medicinal products known to interfere with the effect of epinephrine was 
excluded from Palforzia clinical studies to ensure that subject safety was not compromised if the use of 
epinephrine was required. Beta-adrenergic blockers antagonise the cardiostimulating and 
bronchodilating effects of epinephrine and alpha-adrenergic blockers antagonise the vasoconstricting 
and hypertensive effects of epinephrine.  
The adverse effects of epinephrine may be potentiated in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants, 
levothyroxine sodium, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. 
Further, it is recommended that other types of AIT are not initiated during the up-dosing phase of 
Palforzia OIT. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the controlled population, AEs led to discontinuation in 10.9% of subjects in the Palforzia group and 
2.4% in the placebo group. Most common system organ class of AEs leading to discontinuation were 
associated with GI disorders during initial dose escalation and up-dosing (7.6% Palforzia, 0.9% 
placebo). These disorders were characterised by abdominal pain (3.7%Palforzia, 0.3% placebo), 
vomiting (3.0%, 0%), nausea (2.1% Palforzia, 0% placebo), and systemic allergic reaction, including 
anaphylaxis (1.4% Palforzia, 0% placebo). Systemic allergic reaction led to discontinuation in 2 
subjects (1 had anaphylaxis) during 300 mg/day dosing in study ARC003. 
In the integrated safety population, 108 subjects (11.4%) discontinued study product. The AEs leading 
to discontinuation of study product were consistent with the controlled population and the majority of 
subjects discontinued during up-dosing (8.7%) followed by initial dose escalation (2.1%) and all 300 
mg/day dosing (1.2%). 
Correspondent data were gained in study ARC007 were 20 Palforzia-treated subjects discontinued from 
the study due to chronic/recurrent GI adverse events. However, GI adverse events resolved in up to 2

weeks for 17 of 20 subjects, between 2 and 4 weeks in 2 subjects, whereas the time to resolution was 
unknown for 1 subject. These data suggest, that GI symptoms resolved when stopping Palforzia 
intake. 
Of note: Discontinuation due to an AE is only one aspect. Other reasons for discontinuations included 
‘Dosing Symptom’ 3%, ‘Withdrew consent’ 6%, ‘Sponsor decision’ 1%, and ‘Other’ 2%. The applicant 
has as adequately as possible clarified the reasons for discontinuation that was not specifically due to 
AEs. Overall, approximately 22% of patients treated with Palforzia discontinued the studies while only 
approximately half of these were reported to be due to AEs. However, it appears that the majority of 
the other discontinuations are likely to be related to the Palforzia treatment as well, e.g. 
discontinuation due to dosing symptoms, which are described as “allergic reactions observed after 
dosing with the study product during supervised dosing at study sites” (2.7% of all Palforzia patients). 
Furthermore, most patients who withdrew consent where noted to have mild or moderate AEs around 
the time of the withdrawal (6% of all Palforzia patients). In the placebo group, 7% discontinued 
treatment. Thus, overall it could be concluded that approx. 15% of the patients treated with Palforzia 
discontinued specifically due to reactions to the study product.   
When considering the entire population of 1182 Palforzia-treated subjects aged 4 to 55 years in the 
integrated population overall 42.6% discontinued from treatment as follows: 
42.6% any reason, 14.3% adverse event/symptom, 21.1% withdrew consent 
4 to 11 years:   37.7% any reason, 13.1% adverse event/symptom, 18.2% withdrew consent 
12 to 17 years: 49.6% any reason, 15.3% adverse event/symptom, 26.3% withdrew consent 
18 to 55 years: 63.6% any reason, 23.6% adverse event/symptom, 25.5% withdrew consent 
A total of 430 subjects were still receiving Palforzia in the ongoing study ARC008 as of the latest data 
cutoff (03 Jun 2020) and discontinuations so far were noted out to day 1345 (ie, after 3.7 years of 
Palforzia treatment). 
Presented data within the day 120 responses depict that in ARC004 group 1 (former placebo-treated 
subjects from study ARC003), only 55 of 102 subjects (53.9%) completed the study and 47 subjects 
(46.1%) discontinued early. In the day 180 responses, the applicant explained that the most common 
reason for early discontinuation in ARC004 group 1 was withdrawal of consent (31.4%). Of the 32 
subjects who withdrew consent, 14 were aged 4 to 11 years and 18 were aged 12 to 17 years, so 
proportionally, the rate of voluntary withdrawal of consent was again higher in the adolescent age 
group. Thus, withdrawal of consent in this ARC004 group of 102 formerly placebo-treated subjects was 
considerably higher than the withdrawal of consent rate of 10.8% for the integrated population. 
Post marketing experience 
Palforzia was approved in the United States on 31 January 2020. No post-marketing experience have 
been provided. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Summary of safety data 
Safety data have been reviewed for the integrated safety population, including 944 subjects from 5 
clinical studies (ARC003, ARC007, ARC010, ARC004, ARC011) who received at least 1 dose of 
Palforzia, including 770 subjects who received the maintenance dose of 300 mg/day. Approximately 
one-fourth of subjects were enrolled in Europe. The safety database is considered adequate.

The most relevant safety data derived from the combined controlled population, which compromised 
841 subjects treated with Palforzia and 335 subjects treated with placebo, from the 3 randomised 
controlled phase 3 clinical trials (ARC003 (Europe and North America), ARC007 (North America only), 
ARC010 (Europe only)) data cut-off date 15 Dec 2018.  
Data from 2 phase 2 studies ARC001 and ARC002 as well as from uncontrolled, follow-on studies 
(ARC004 and ARC011) (data cut-off date 15 Dec 2018) provided further supportive data on long-term 
safety. It is noted that a subset of patients, Group 2 Cohort 2, in the extension study ARC004 
submitted during the evaluation, were excluded from the safety analyses.  
In above presented populations, subjects in the Palforzia group were treated for a median of 2.0 days 
during initial dose escalation, and during up-dosing for a median of 154.0 days (22 weeks). In the 
integrated safety population, 81.6% of subjects reached the maintenance dose of 300 mg/day and 
were treated for a median of 27 weeks overall, and with any dose of Palforzia for approximately 49 
weeks overall. The longest treatment with Palforzia was in subjects who received Palforzia in the phase 
2 study ARC001 and continued treatment in the follow-on study ARC002 (median exposure 
approximately 3 years). Patients in phase 3 studies have been followed for a maximum of two years 
(n=26) by the latest cut-off date. Thus, no recommendation is currently possible beyond 24 months; 
this is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
With this population, the ICH E1 safety exposure requirements of 300 to 600 patients for 6 months, 
respectively > 100 patients for 1 year are fulfilled. 
In general, baseline demographic characteristics were similar and adequately balanced among 
treatment groups (active-placebo). 
Discontinuations and treatment duration 
In the overall placebo-controlled population of subjects aged 4 to 55 years (882 Palforzia, 349 placebo 
as of 03 Jun 2020), 22.9% Palforzia and 6.6% placebo patients discontinued from studies for any 
reason. The primary reason for discontinuation was adverse events or symptoms for 12.1% Palforzia 
and 2.3% placebo and withdrawal of consent for 6.9% Palforzia and 2.9% placebo.  
Discontinuations due to adverse events or symptoms in the overall population were higher during up-
dosing (9.7% Palforzia, 1.2% placebo) and substantially lower during maintenance (0.7% Palforzia, 
0.3% placebo). It should be noted that the maintenance period in the controlled studies was relatively 
short (approximately 2 weeks in ARC007, 3 months in ARC010, and 6 months in ARC003). Withdrawal 
of consent was also higher during up-dosing (4.9% Palforzia, 2.0% placebo) than maintenance (2.1% 
Palforzia, 0.9% placebo). 
When discontinuations are considered by age group (4-11 years, 12-17 years, 18-55 years), overall 
discontinuations increased by age group. Within each group, discontinuations due to adverse events or 
symptoms and withdrawal of consent were higher during up-dosing and substantially lower during 
maintenance except in the 18 to 55 years group, where withdrawal of consent was similar between up-
dosing and maintenance (15.4%, 16.0%).  
A similar trend was observed considering the entire population of 1182 Palforzia-treated subjects aged 
4 to 55 years in the integrated population. Overall 42.6% discontinued from treatment for any reason, 
14.3% due to adverse event/symptom and 21.1% withdrew consent and discontinuations increased by 
age (see also section ‘Discontinuation due to AEs’). 
A total of 430 subjects were still receiving Palforzia in the ongoing study ARC008 as of the latest data 
cutoff (03 Jun 2020) and discontinuations so far were noted after 3.7 years of Palforzia treatment. As 
there are no data which address a possible rebound effect in patient, who discontinued treatment, 
CHMP considered that possible rebound effect should be monitored in the follow-on open-label ARC008

study listed in the RMP. In addition, possible rebound effect after discontinuation of treatment is added 
as an important potential risk in the RMP.  
Common adverse events 
Overall TEAEs for the integrated safety and for the controlled population are comparable. The incidence 
of adverse reactions was higher during up-dosing (85.7%) than initial dose escalation (45.1%) and 
maintenance (57.7%). During the initial dose escalation and up-dosing phase, abdominal pain (53%), 
throat irritation (42%), pruritus (37%), vomiting (37%), nausea (36%), and cough (34%) were most 
common among Palforzia treated individuals. During the maintenance phase, abdominal pain (15-
22%), urticaria (20%), pruritus (15-22%), cough (19-20%), and oral paraesthesia (7-17%) were most 
common among Palforzia treated individuals.  
Based on the observations on the increased incidence of reactions during the initial dose escalation and 
up-dosing phases, there is a risk that during up-dosing a patient may be exposed to higher dose 
escalations due to the possible differences in potencies between the batches. This is especially a 
concern during the up-dosing phase, where patients have not yet developed a reasonable tolerance to 
peanut protein. For each dose level during up-dosing, the doses given in clinic and at home should be 
from the same batch to avoid variations in the potency range. This is reflected in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC.  
Systemic allergic reactions (anaphylactic reactions) 
The main risk associated with treatment with Palforzia is a systemic allergic reaction, which occurred in 
15.1% of the population, including 0.6% during initial dose escalation, 8.7% during up-dosing, and 
9.9% during maintenance. The majority of patients experienced a single event but 3% of the total 
population experienced two or more anaphylactic reactions.  
Anaphylaxis, defined as a severe systemic allergic reaction, was reported in 10 subjects (1.1% 
overall), including 4 subjects (0.4%) during up-dosing and 6 (0.8%) during all 300 mg/day dosing; 1 
patient had a serious event. All subjects recovered and none required prolonged hospital admission or 
required intensive support with antihypotensive medication or intubation. Six subjects continued study 
treatment and 4 discontinued from their study. Eight of the 10 subjects who experienced anaphylaxis 
had potential cofactors.  
Most allergic reactions occurred during the initial dose escalation and up-dosing phases. However, 
during the maintenance phase, the risk of anaphylactic reactions remained approximately ten times 
higher in the treatment than the placebo group. Even when looking at subjects who are on 
maintenance for as long as 66-78 weeks, incidence of systemic allergic reactions did not appear to 
decrease over the course of the individual studies, neither did the severity of the systemic allergic 
reactions appear to change. Nevertheless, these reactions mostly occur during the first 2 hours after 
ingestion of the dose and are usually mild or moderate.  
CHMP considered that the induction of allergic reactions due to daily contact with the allergen was 
expected, as well as the observation that adverse events were in general higher during up-dosing than 
initial dose escalation and maintenance. Furthermore, it is accepted that patients only on peanut free 
diet suffer much less from allergic reactions. Different multivariate analysis documented again that 
treatment per se; age and sensitization are associated with increased risk for adverse events. 
In the CHMP’s view, the risk of allergic reaction is adequately addressed in the section 4.2 of the SmPC 
which recommends that the initial dose escalation and the first dose of each new up-dosing level are 
administered in a health care setting prepared to manage potential severe allergic reactions. In 
addition, self-injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) must be available to the patient at all times.

It is also acknowledged that patients are more likely to experience allergic symptoms in the presence 
of certain co-factors which are known to increase the likelihood of allergic reactions in general. These 
cofactors may be modifiable or non-modifiable. Modifiable co-factors may include exercise, hot bath or 
shower, alcohol consumption, fasting, or intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Non 
modifiable co-factors may include intercurrent illness (eg, influenza or viral infection), an increase in 
severity of asthma, menstruation, stress, fatigue or sleep deprivation. Furthermore, non-adherence to 
daily treatment, also during subsequent years of maintenance, seems to increase the risk of adverse 
allergic reactions. Therefore, adequate guidance on the management of co-factors have been added in 
section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
In general, the complexity within Palforzia treatment (including dose modification upon individual cases 
of intercurrent events like stress, alcohol consumption, viral illness, menses or others) likely exposes 
patients to additional risk as it may be difficult to comply with the elaborate rules and its feasibility of 
transmission to real-life settings. At the CHMP’s request, the applicant adequately revised the 
instructions and recommendations in the SmPC. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that treatment 
regimen requires commitment, active participation and a shared-decision making between the patient, 
its family and the treating physician and that Palforzia treatment will not be suitable for all patients 
with peanut allergy. Healthcare professional and patients/caregivers educational materials and a 
patient card have been created to provide education and counselling regarding the appropriate use, 
adverse reactions and their management, and when to seek medical care.  
Furthermore, appropriate risk minimisation measures have included in the SmPC to manage the risk of 
systemic anaphylactic reactions such as special warnings and precautions for use (sections 4.2, 4.3, 
4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). The package leaflet is updated accordingly. Anaphylaxis/systemic allergic 
reactions is also listed as an important identified risk in the RMP. Furthermore, additional 
pharmacovigilance activities are performed to further collect safety data on the risk of anaphylactic 
reaction from the ongoing open-label extension for maintenance of desensitization and safety study 
(ARC008). In addition, the risk is reflected in the healthcare professional education materials and 
patient and parent/caregiver educational materials as mentioned above. 
CHMP also noted that up to now, no markers or special patient characteristics are evident, which may 
predict if an individual patient would suffer from more and/or more severe allergic adverse effects. Sub 
analysis (post-hoc) of study safety data suggest that a consistent pattern of predictors can be 
observed. In particular, treatment remains the strongest predictor of adverse events, after adjustment. 
Furthermore, the applicant confirms that age ≥12 years consistently shows an association with higher 
odds for adverse events. The section 4.4 of the SmPC includes that patients aged 12 years or older 
and/or with high sensitivity to peanut may be at higher risk of experiencing allergic symptoms during 
treatment. Similarly, high baseline levels of ps-IgE Ara h 2 are associated with increased risk of 
adverse events. Results suggest that Log10 ps-IgE/IgG4 ratio and ps-IgE Ara h 3 may also be 
predictive for systemic allergic reactions and epinephrine use, while an association of ps-IgE Ara h 9 
and SPT with the odds for discontinuation due to GI adverse events was observed. However, no 
individual baseline factor is sufficiently strong to warrant withholding Palforzia treatment from 
adolescent patients with peanut allergy. 
Eosinophilic esophagitis and other gastrointestinal disorders 
The second main safety risk associated with Palforzia is eosinophilic oesophagitis. In clinical trials, 12 
out of 1,217 subjects were diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed eosinophilic oesophagitis while receiving 
Palforzia compared with 0 of 443 subjects receiving placebo. After discontinuation of Palforzia, 
symptomatic improvement was reported in 12 of 12 subjects. In 8 subjects with available follow-up 
biopsy results, eosinophilic oesophagitis was resolved in 6 subjects and improved in 2 subjects.  
Assessment report

Page 87/88 
 
 
  
Other gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events observed, the leading term 
was abdominal pain, followed by vomiting, and nausea. Abdominal pain was described in the highest 
rates during up-dosing (Palforzia 415 (49.3%), Placebo 59 (17.6%); (Controlled Population)). Although 
reducing to 3.4% - 9%, abdominal pain was still present during maintenance. When focusing on AEs 
Grade ≥3 severity, especially gastrointestinal disorders had been reported (1.1%) in 818 Palforzia 
treated subjects. Again, GI AEs occurred more often during up-dosing than during maintenance 
therapy. 
For chronic/recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, especially upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, 
vomiting, dysphagia), the potential for a diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis should be considered. 
In patients who experience severe or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, including dysphagia, 
gastroesophageal reflux, chest pain, or abdominal pain, treatment must be discontinued and a 
diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis should be considered. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
“A history of, or current, eosinophilic oesophagitis; other eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease; chronic, 
recurrent, or severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); dysphagia” are contraindications to the 
use of Palforzia. A warning about gastro-intestinal adverse reactions including eosinophilic oesophagitis 
is also included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to inform about the risk and to provide instructions if 
patients develop chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms. Eosinophilic oesophagitis is listed in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC as an adverse reaction with a frequency uncommon. The package leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, it is listed an important identified risk in the RMP. Furthermore, 
eosinophilic oesophagitis will be further monitored in the ongoing open-label extension for maintenance 
of desensitization and safety study (ARC008). 
Age 
The data gained so far suggest an age-dependent effect. Additional statistical analysis provided by the 
applicant documented that age ≥12 years consistently shows an association with higher odds for 
adverse events. The same was true for certain sensitization parameters at baseline. The section 4.4 of 
the SmPC includes that patients aged 12 years or older and/or with high sensitivity to peanut may be 
at higher risk of experiencing allergic symptoms during treatment (see also ‘Safety in special 
population’ section). 
There is limited data available in subjects turning 18 years of age while being on treatment with 
Palforzia. In total, 51 subjects were enrolled at age ≤ 17 years and subsequently turned age 18 during 
treatment with Palforzia. The applicant reported that nearly two-thirds of these subjects continue to be 
treated in study ARC008, some with cumulative treatment of more than 3 years.  
In ARC003, safety data is derived from 55 subjects aged 18-55 years (median age 23.0 years). From 
these population, 7 subjects (17.1%) in Palforzia group (n=41) discontinued study product due to 1 or 
more events. In general the overall pattern of adverse events and safety profile for adult subjects aged 
18 to 55 years in study ARC003 was consistent with the pattern observed in paediatric subjects aged 4 
to 17 years. 
As observed for the paediatric population, discontinuation rate as well as number of systemic allergic 
reactions was higher in adults compared to younger patients. 
Interactions and Laboratory results 
No direct interactions are expected with Palforzia nor have they been investigated. Nevertheless, 
peanut OIT is not recommended while undergoing other types or allergen immunotherapy.  
Further, specific conditions (e.g. chronic lung disease) or treatments making the patient either 
unresponsive to treatment of anaphylaxis (e.g. beta-blockers) or more susceptible to adverse reactions

during treatment with epinephrine (e.g. TCAs) are addressed in the SmPC. The SmPC text regarding 
interactions is considered sufficient.  
Impact on long-term immune-mediated reactions 
Long-term data on the incidence of immune-mediated reactions such as anaphylactic reactions and 
eosinophilic esophagitis are available for 103 subjects and 26 subjects who completed 12 and 18 
months respectively of Palforzia maintenance treatment with the ongoing therapeutic dose (300 mg 
daily) through participation in both ARC003 and the open-label, follow-on ARC004 study. The impact 
on long-term immune-mediated reactions beyond this period are limited. Therefore this safety 
concerns is listed as missing information in the RMP and the impact on long-term immune-mediated 
reactions will be further characterised through the open label, longer-term follow-on study (ARC008) 
that will evaluate safety data for patients who have received as much as 5-years total treatment and a 
subsequent 1-year follow-up observation. 
Use during pregnancy 
Patients who were pregnant were not treated with Palforzia in the clinical studies. Potential symptoms 
and signs of anaphylaxis and systemic allergic reactions in pregnancy include intense itching in the 
vulvar and vaginal areas, low back pain, uterine cramps, foetal distress, and preterm labour. 
Anaphylaxis can cause a dangerous decrease in blood pressure, which could result in compromised 
placental perfusion and significant risk to a foetus during pregnancy. In addition, the effect of Palforzia 
on the immune system of the mother and foetus during pregnancy is unknown. Therefore, a statement 
that indicate that there are no data on the clinical experience of Palforzia in pregnant women is 
included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. A warning that Palforzia should not be initiated during pregnancy 
is also included in section 4.6 of the SmPC and guidance for the patient no to start treatment with 
Palforzia if she is pregnant or planning to become pregnant and to ask her doctor for advice is included 
in section 2 of the package leaflet. Guidance for a benefit/risk assessment to be undertaken for 
patients established on OIT therapy and who become pregnant considering the benefits of OIT and 
retaining desensitisation and the risks of an anaphylactic reaction while remaining on OIT is also 
included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. Use during pregnancy is listed as a missing information in the RMP 
and pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women exposed to Palforzia ascertained by spontaneous 
reporting will be monitored in a post-marketing pregnancy registry as listed in the RMP. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data coming from 5 completed clinical studies as well as updated analysis of ongoing follow-
up studies is considered adequate to characterise the safety profile in the target population of patient 
4-17 years and subjects turning 18 years during treatment.  
The most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were related to allergic reactions with 
systemic allergic reactions (anaphylactic reactions) being the main safety risk associated with Palforzia 
treatment. Most reactions occurred during the up-dosing and initial dose escalation phases. Existing 
data suggest that patients aged 12 years or older and/or with high sensitivity to peanut may be at 
higher risk of experiencing allergic symptoms during treatment. Systemic allergic reaction was also 
one of the reasons for discontinuation of treatment in 1.6% of the case. 
The induction of allergic reactions due to daily contact with the allergen was expected, as well as the 
observation that adverse events were in general higher during up-dosing than initial dose escalation 
and maintenance. In addition, the complexity within Palforzia treatment is acknowledged as it likely

exposes patients to additional risk and it may be difficult to comply with the elaborate rules and its 
feasibility of transmission to real-life settings. Treatment regimen requires commitment, active 
participation and a shared-decision making between the patient, its family and the treating physician 
and it is acknowledged that Palforzia treatment will not be suitable for all patients with peanut allergy. 
Appropriate warnings and instructions are included in the product information. They are considered 
adequate by the CHMP and are regarded as helpful for daily use. Systemic anaphylactic reactions will 
be further monitored in a post-authorisation safety study. CHMP considered that appropriate risk 
minimisation measures have been put in place and careful selection of patients are expected to make 
the risks manageable through appropriate guidance in the SmPC and educational materials. 
Although few cases were reported (1% of patient with Palforzia, 0 with Placebo), eosinophilic 
oesophagitis was identified as the second most important safety risk associated with Palforzia 
treatment. Oesophagitis; other eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease are therefore been added as 
contraindications to the use of Palforzia and special warning and instructions for use have been added 
in the product information. Eosinophilic oesophagitis will be further monitored in the post-authorisation 
safety study (ARC008).  CHMP considered that appropriate risk minimisation measures have been put 
in place to manage the risk. 
The age group 12 to 17 years consistently shows an association with higher odds for adverse events, 
but adverse events are mostly predictable and occurring in close proximity to dose administration. 
Adequate SmPC recommendation allowing for careful selection of patients who can receive Palforzia 
treatment are expected to adequately mitigate any additional risk. Based on the data provided, the 
CHMP also agreed that safety and efficacy are comparables in subjects turning age 18 on Palforzia 
treatment. 
In conclusion, the safety profile of Palforzia in the claimed indication is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 31.01.2020. The new EURD list entry will

therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts) has been 
previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union but differs significantly with regard 
to safety and/or efficacy due to differences in molecular structure, nature of the source material or 
manufacturing process. 
Based on the available quality and clinical data, the CHMP considers, that defatted powder of Arachis 
hypogaea L., semen (peanuts), which have some differences in molecular structure, nature of the 
source material or manufacturing process, does not differ significantly in properties with regard to 
safety and/or efficacy from medicinal products previously authorised within the European Union and 
therefore is not considered to be a new active substance. 
A clear clinical argumentation for a new active substance claim regarding significant differences in 
terms of efficacy and safety has not been given by the applicant. Therefore, the active substance 
defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts) contained in the medicinal product Palforzia 
is not to be qualified as a new active substance in comparison to the known active substances 
previously authorised in the European Union as medicinal products for skin prick testing as it was not 
shown to differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and efficacy from the previously 
authorised substance.  
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Quick Response (QR) code 
Not applicable 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Palforzia (defatted powder of Arachis 
hypogaea L., semen (peanuts)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it is a biological product.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Peanut allergy is a potentially life-threatening disease that disproportionately affects children, resolving 
in only approximately 20% of affected individuals2. In Europe, the prevalence of peanut allergy in 
children is approximately 1.6% as estimated by food challenges or clinical history1. 
IgE-mediated peanut sensitisation typically begins in infancy and progresses to a symptomatic allergy 
with increasing age. In most patients, peanut allergy is life-long. Some studies have reported that 
approximately 20% of children diagnosed with peanut allergy outgrow it7,8,9. Another study confirmed 
peanut allergy by food challenge in patients aged 1 year and reported resolution of peanut allergy in 
22% of patients by age 4 years10. In patients who become tolerant to peanut, resolution of peanut 
allergy usually occurs by age 6 years and at a much lower frequency after age 10 years11. 
Peanut allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis and death related to food. Unintended food 
allergen exposures are common, with 55% of patients with peanut allergy reporting at least 1 allergic 
reaction over approximately 5 years18. Allergic responses may be triggered by minute quantities (< 5 
mg) of peanut protein in individuals with peanut allergy 13. Factors associated with life-threatening 
allergic reactions to peanut include a history of anaphylaxis to peanut, comorbid conditions (e.g., 
asthma, cardiovascular disease, systemic mastocytosis), the presence of a medical event such as 
intercurrent illness (e.g., viral infection), or the presence of other cofactors that may decrease the 
threshold for allergic reaction following allergen exposure (e.g., menstruation, stress, fatigue, sleep 
deprivation, exercise, increased body temperature, intake of NSAIDs, and alcohol use)40. Risk-taking 
behaviour in teenagers and young adults, such as failure to avoid triggers, failure to carry an 
epinephrine auto-injector, and alcohol use are thought to contribute to severe or fatal anaphylaxis4. 
The severity of chronic atopic disease such as asthma has been associated with the severity of peanut-
induced acute allergic reactions41. As multiple factors can influence the severity of an allergic reaction, 
the severity of a reaction after unintended allergen exposure can be unpredictable 42,43. 
Although death from food-induced anaphylaxis is rare, the burden of avoidance and constant fear of 
unintended exposure can negatively affect the health-related quality of life for individuals with food 
allergies and their families20,12,21,22. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
No licensed therapeutic option is available for use in routine clinical practice for the treatment of 
people with peanut allergy in the EU. Current standard of care includes strict avoidance of peanut and 
treatment for allergic reactions following exposure. Exposure to peanut is inherently unpredictable, and 
the risk of severe, life-threatening, or even fatal allergic reactions increases when access to medical 
care and epinephrine are not readily available3.

An important part of management of peanut allergy is education of the patient and family on the 
recognition and management of allergy symptoms and appropriate use of rescue medications (e.g., 
antihistamines, epinephrine auto-injectors). Prompt treatment with intramuscular epinephrine is the 
first-line treatment for anaphylaxis23. 
However, possession of epinephrine auto-injectors and their emergency use for anaphylaxis may also 
be inadequate, and may lead to adverse outcomes including hospitalisation and death24. Delay of 
rescue treatment can lead to severe and fatal allergic reactions3. 
Patients with peanut allergy are required to follow a strict peanut-avoidant diet, which can be difficult, 
imposes a significant negative quality-of-life burden on the patient and the patient’s family and is a 
limited option to address the condition 20,12,21,22. Strict adherence to an avoidance diet can be 
complicated by difficulty in interpreting food labels44,14, the presence of undeclared or inadvertent 
introduction of allergens in commercially prepared foods15,16, and inattention to or mistrust of food 
warning labels 17. Foods prepared outside the home (e.g., at school, day care centres, restaurants, 
homes of family/friends) present additional potential sources of exposure. 
Despite efforts at strict peanut avoidance, unintended exposure remains a major concern because 
allergic responses may be triggered by milligram doses of peanut protein. In a recent study conducted 
in the Netherlands, individuals with food allergy (including peanut) were provided counselling on an 
appropriate food-avoidance diet and were prospectively followed for 1 year. Despite counselling and 
education, 46% of patients reported an allergic reaction after unintended exposure and of these, 55% 
were patients with peanut allergy45. The mean number of reactions after unintended exposure was 
approximately 1 per person per year. 
In 2018, the EAACI published guidelines on allergen immunotherapy for IgE-mediated food allergy46. 
During the development of this guideline, the EAACI conducted a formal systematic review and meta-
analyses of randomised controlled studies of allergen immunotherapy in food-allergic individuals47. For 
OIT, these analyses defined a quantifiable benefit for desensitisation and a quantifiable risk of systemic 
allergic reactions. This benefit-risk assessment was considered favourable by the EAACI, and 
subsequently led to the recommendation of OIT for treatment of children with peanut allergy aged 4 
years and older. However, several gaps have been identified by EAACI, e.g., lack of a standardised 
product with documented dosing regime, efficacy and safety.  
Given the risk of life-threatening allergic reactions and lack of any licensed therapy for patients with 
peanut allergy, there is an unmet need for new therapies that reduce the incidence and severity of 
allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, after exposure to peanut.  
Palforzia has been developed to address this unmet medical need. Palforzia results are consistent with 
the benefits and risks to those considered favourable in the EAACI guideline. Notably, the Palforzia 
development program addresses many of the data gaps identified by EAACI, in that it provided a 
standardised product, a dosing protocol that has been assessed in 2 large randomised controlled 
studies, and a comprehensive assessment of safety during both up-dosing and maintenance.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The Palforzia clinical development program in children, adolescents, and adults with peanut allergy 
included 2 phase 2 studies (ARC001, ARC002) and 7 phase 3 studies (ARC003, ARC004, ARC005, 
ARC007, ARC008, ARC010, ARC011). During the evaluation, study ARC004 (open-label follow-on 
ARC003 study) was completed and the final clinical study report was assessed during the procedure. 
In all Palforzia clinical studies, efficacy was measured using a DBPCFC. This food challenge was 
performed according to the Practical Allergy (PRACTALL) guidelines with modification to include a 
600 mg protein dose (between the 300 mg and 1000 mg challenge doses). 
The efficacy of Palforzia was assessed in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, 
phase 3 pivotal studies ARC003 (PALISADE) and ARC010 (ARTEMIS). Both studies recruited subjects 
with a documented history of peanut allergy. Subjects with a severe or life-threatening anaphylaxis 
event within 60 days of study entry and those with severe or uncontrolled asthma were excluded from 
the studies. After an initial dose escalation ranging from 0.5 mg to 6 mg on day 1 and confirmation of 
tolerability of the 3 mg dose on day 2, subjects underwent up-dosing for 20 to 40 weeks starting at 
3 mg until the 300 mg dose was reached. The up-dosing period varied for each subject depending on 
doses tolerated. Subjects then underwent 6 months (ARC003) or 3 months (ARC010) of maintenance 
immunotherapy with 300 mg Palforzia or placebo until the end of the study when subjects completed 
an exit DBPCFC to assess desensitisation to peanut. 
ARC003 recruited subjects aged 4 to 55 years in Europe and North America. A total of 750 subjects 
aged 4 to 17 years were screened and 499 were randomly assigned (3:1) to study treatment (374 to 
Palforzia and 125 to placebo). ARC010 recruited subjects aged 4 to 17 years of age in Europe. A total 
of 175 subjects aged 4 to 17 years were randomly assigned (3:1) to study treatment (132 to Palforzia 
and 43 to placebo).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The results of the pre-specified analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints of the 2 
pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies ARC003 and ARC010 demonstrate statistical 
significance and consistency. The primary efficacy endpoint (proportion of subjects aged 4 to 17 years 
who tolerate a single highest dose of at least 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein with no 
more than mild symptoms at the Exit DBPCFC) was met in both studies ARC003 and ARC010. 
Treatment with Palforzia in the ITT population (4-17 years) resulted in statistically significant 
treatment effects over placebo, with treatment differences of 47.8% (p < 0.0001) in ARC003 and 
56.0% (p < 0.0001) in ARC010.  
Favourable treatment effects were also observed for key secondary endpoints of desensitization 
response and maximum severity of symptoms for subjects aged 4 to 17 years. These outcomes were 
further confirmed by supportive and sensitivity subgroup analyses and by sensitivity analyses using 
predefined analysis populations and worst-case imputation methods. 
In the completer population of subjects aged 4 to 17 years, the proportion of subjects who tolerated a 
single dose of 1000 mg peanut protein at the exit DBPCFC with no more than mild symptoms was 
63.2% for Palforzia-treated subjects in ARC003 and 72.6% in ARC010. 
The proportion of subjects in the completer population who tolerated a single dose of 600 mg and 300 
mg peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms were 84.5% and 96.3%, respectively in ARC003, 
and 84.9% and 91.5%, respectively, in ARC010.

In addition, the maximum severity of symptoms at any challenge dose during the exit DBPCFC for 
subjects aged 4 to 17 years in the ITT populations of ARC003 and ARC010 was reduced in the Palforzia 
group compared with placebo. In ARC003, the maximum severity of symptoms among treated subjects 
was no symptoms (37.6% Palforzia, 2.4% placebo), mild symptoms (32.0%, 28.2%), moderate 
symptoms (25.3%, 58.9%), and severe symptoms (5.1%, 10.5%). In ARC010, the maximum severity 
of symptoms was no symptoms (35.6% Palforzia, 0% placebo), mild symptoms (41.7%, 37.2%), 
moderate symptoms (18.2%, 46.5%), and severe symptoms (4.5%, 16.3%).  
Moreover, fewer subjects treated with Palforzia used epinephrine as a rescue medication at the exit 
DBPCFC compared with subjects treated with placebo despite similar epinephrine use at the screening 
DBPCFC. 
The response rate of Palforzia treated subjects who turned 18 years whilst participating in a study and 
tolerated a single highest dose of at least 1,000 mg peanut protein with no more than mild allergic 
symptoms at the exit DBPCFC (15/27, 55.6%) was consistent with the overall primary efficacy of the 
subjects aged 4 to 17 years. 
Sustained efficacy has been demonstrated in 102 subjects and 26 subjects who completed 12 and 
18 months of Palforzia maintenance treatment with the ongoing therapeutic dose (300 mg daily) 
through participation in both ARC003 and the open-label, follow-on ARC004 study.  
The data from ARC003 and its follow-on study ARC004 indicate that during continued maintenance 
therapy, the modulation of immunologic responses to treatment continues as demonstrated by a 
further decrease in peanut-specific IgE, a further increase in peanut-specific IgG4, and a reduction in 
skin prick test mean wheal diameter. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Efficacy data associated with age 
Regarding favourable effects, limitations address especially the efficacy data associated with age. 
Younger individuals seem to have higher efficacy rates than older children/adolescents. As an example, 
the primary efficacy analysis was repeated for the ITT population age subgroups of 4 to 11 years and 
12 to 17 years. In study ARC010, the results were consistent with the overall population although the 
treatment difference was less for the much smaller age group of 12 to 17 years (35 Palforzia, 13 
placebo; 45.7% [95% CI: 28.8, 63.4]; p = 0.0033) compared with 4 to 11 years (97 Palforzia, 30 
placebo; 62.9% [95% CI: 52.5, 72.5]; p < 0.0001). In ARC003, the younger children (4-11yrs) had 
slightly higher response rates (52.5% vs 46.3%) and slightly more subjects out of the placebo group 
showed higher tolerance rates. However, the numbers (especially of 12 – 17 year-old-subjects) are 
small and a distinction in efficacy between age groups cannot be made. In addition, the treatment 
difference compared to placebo is still clinically relevant in both age group. 
In addition, limited data are available in subjects turning 18 years of age while being on treatment with 
Palforzia. However, it is agreed with the applicant that young adults with peanut allergy who started 
treatment at age under 18 years should be given the opportunity to decide with their physicians if 
continuing Palforzia treatment is the right option for them, as no other approved treatment is 
available. Appropriate warning and instructions for use have been made in the product information in 
order to ascertain that the safety profile of Palforzia is clinically manageable. 
Uncertainties about threshold 
The threshold for the primary endpoint in Europe was discussed in scientific advices and was defined 
as tolerating a single dose of 1000 mg peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms in the exit

DBPCFC. According to the applicant, already tolerating 300 mg peanut protein would be clinically 
relevant, as most patients react to lower doses. DBPCFC is the gold standard for evaluation of peanut 
allergy. As several co-factors may impact the severity of reactions in real-life it is not predicting that 
the same amount could be tolerated each time in real life. Thus, the defined threshold of 1000mg has 
a good safety margin and was regarded sufficient for clinical relevance 
Uncertainties about effect rate in highly allergic subjects 
In order to analyse different effect rates between “highly” allergic subjects compared to less allergic 
ones (characterised by the level of specific IgE, SPT or the reaction level at baseline DBPCFC) 
descriptive sub-analyses were presented with the day 120 responses. These sub-analyses suggest that 
children aged 4-11 years, who are less sensitive seem to benefit most. As such, highest responses 
were seen in children 4-11 years of age with peanut-specific IgE < 66.7kUA/L at baseline showing a 
response rate of 75.5%; Children 4-11 years of age with reaction at > 3mg in screening DBPFC 
showed a response rate of 67.5%. However, as these post-hoc analyses may only be considered 
exploratory, no conclusions can be drawn to guide treatment decision.  
Uncertainties about long term efficacy 
The 2 main pivotal clinical studies covers a maintenance phase of 3 (ARC010) and 6 months (ARC003) 
and only 26 patients have been followed for a maximum of 2 years by the latest cut-off date. 
Therefore, CHMP considers that no recommendation can be made about the duration of treatment 
beyond 24 months. The effect of stopping treatment on maintenance of clinical efficacy or on disease 
modification has not been evaluated. Further long-term efficacy (and safety) data with patients who 
have received as much as 5-year total treatment and a subsequent 1-year follow-up observation are 
planned to be collected in the long-term follow-on study ARC008 study listed in the RMP. 
Quality of life 
Treatment with Palforzia resulted in similar quality of life as measured by subject and parent reported 
scores from baseline to exit. This result is not surprising and reflects what is seen in the literature. A 
change in quality of life need more time than the study duration where many subjects experienced an 
improvement in tolerated amount of peanut protein but still were blinded and did not “experience” real 
life situations. Treatment adherence is very important and starting treatment with Palforzia requires an 
active participation and a shared-decision making between patients (and families) and the treating 
physician. Further data on quality of life are expected to be retrieved from follow-on studies.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Most comment adverse reactions 
The most common adverse reactions (of any severity) are abdominal pain (49.4%), throat irritation 
(40.7%), pruritus (33.7%), nausea (33.2%), vomiting (28.5%), urticaria (28.5%), oral pruritus 
(26.0%), abdominal discomfort (22.9%), and abdominal pain upper (22.8%).  
The incidence of adverse reactions was higher during up-dosing (85.7%) than initial dose escalation 
(45.1%) and maintenance (57.7%). The general observation that more reactions occur especially 
during initial dose escalation and up-dosing, may also be associated with quality related concerns 
regarding the potency range of the Palforzia batches / individual capsules and sachets. Therefore, the 
applicant committed to ascertain that patients during up-dosing are treated with Palforzia from the 
same batch in the clinic (first dose) and at home (subsequent 13 doses) at each dose level (please 
refer to the quality assessment). 
Assessment report

Page 99/100 
 
 
  
In total, 10.5% of subjects discontinued study product due to 1 or more adverse reactions. The most 
common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment were abdominal pain (3.8%), 
vomiting (2.5%), nausea (1.9%), and systemic allergic reaction (1.6%), including anaphylaxis. 
The induction and high incidence of allergic reactions due to daily contact with the allergen was 
expected, as well as the observation that adverse events were in general higher during up-dosing than 
initial dose escalation and maintenance. However, it is obvious that patients only on peanut free diet 
suffer much less from allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. The long-term maintenance of 
desensitization and safety will be further assessed in the ongoing ARC008 study. 
Up to now, no markers or special patient characteristics are evident which may predict which individual 
patient would suffer from more severe allergic effect. However, there seem to be an age-dependent 
effect. Statistical analysis documented that patients aged ≥12 years consistently shows an association 
with higher odds for adverse events. The same was true for certain sensitization parameters at 
baseline. Therefore, the section 4.4 of the SmPC includes that patients aged 12 years or older and/or 
with high sensitivity to peanut may be at higher risk of experiencing allergic symptoms during 
treatment. 
Systemic allergic reactions (anaphylactic reactions) 
The main safety risks associated with Palforzia treatment are systemic allergic reactions (anaphylactic 
reactions) which occurred in 15.1% of subjects; including 0.6% during initial dose escalation, 8.7% 
during up-dosing, and 9.9% during maintenance. Thus, in opposite other adverse reactions, systemic 
allergic reactions do not seem to decrease over time during maintenance. The majority of subjects who 
had systemic allergic reactions had reactions of mild or moderate severity. Severe systemic allergic 
reaction (anaphylaxis) was reported in 10 subjects (1.1% overall), including 4 subjects (0.4%) during 
up-dosing and 6 (0.8%) during maintenance at 300 mg/day. In total, 1.6% discontinued due to 
systemic allergic reaction including 0.3% with anaphylaxis. Of the total population, 10.6% of subjects 
reported a single episode of systemic allergic reaction and 4.6% reported two or more systemic allergic 
reactions. Existing data suggest an increased risk of systemic allergic reaction for adolescents (21.9%) 
than for children (≤ 11 years; 11.9%).  
Patients are more likely to experience allergic symptoms in the presence of certain co-factors which 
are known to increase the likelihood of allergic reactions in general (e.g. exercise, hot bath or shower, 
alcohol consumption, fasting, or intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, viral infection). 
Furthermore, non-adherence to daily treatment, also during subsequent years of maintenance, seems 
to increase the risk of adverse allergic reactions. 
Therefore, guidance on management of co-factors and special warning and precautions for use about 
systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis are included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Anaphylactic 
reaction (systemic allergic reaction; any severity) is also described and listed in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC as an adverse reaction with a frequency very common. The package leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, anaphylaxis/systemic allergic reactions are listed as an important identified 
risk in the RMP. 
Eosinophilic oesophagitis and other gastrointestinal disorders 
The second main safety risk associated with Palforzia is eosinophilic oesophagitis. In clinical trials, 12 
out of 1,217 subjects were diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed eosinophilic oesophagitis while receiving 
Palforzia compared with 0 of 443 subjects receiving placebo. After discontinuation of Palforzia, 
symptomatic improvement was reported in 12 of 12 subjects. In 8 subjects with available follow-up 
biopsy results, eosinophilic oesophagitis was resolved in 6 subjects and improved in 2 subjects. In 
addition, quantitatively most common system organ class of adverse events leading to discontinuation 
Assessment report

Page 100/101 
 
 
  
were associated with gastrointestinal disorders / chronic gastrointestinal events (including abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting and others).  
For chronic/recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, especially upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, 
vomiting, dysphagia), the potential for a diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis should be considered. 
In patients who experience severe or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, including dysphagia, 
gastroesophageal reflux, chest pain, or abdominal pain, treatment must be discontinued and a 
diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis should be considered. 
“A history of, or current, eosinophilic oesophagitis; other eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease; chronic, 
recurrent, or severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); dysphagia” are contraindications to the 
use of Palforzia. A warning about gastro-intestinal adverse reactions including eosinophilic oesophagitis 
is also included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to inform about the risk and to provide instructions if 
patients develop chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms. Eosinophilic oesophagitis is described 
and listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC as an adverse reaction with a frequency uncommon. The package 
leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, it is listed an important identified risk in the RMP.  
Anaphylaxis/systemic allergic reactions and eosinophilic oesophagitis will be followed as additional 
pharmacovigilance activities in the ongoing open-label extension for maintenance of desensitization 
and safety study (ARC008). In addition, both risks are reflected in the healthcare professional 
education materials and patient and parent/caregiver educational materials.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Possible rebound after discontinuation of treatment 
When Palforzia treatment is discontinued an increased severity of allergic reactions (i.e. rebound) upon 
exposure to peanut could possibly occur compared with the severity of allergic reactions before or 
during treatment. The applicant considered that this is very unlikely due to the competitive inhibition 
by IgG4 of antigen binding to IgE and that the effects of IgE elevation have not been observed to 
result in rebound or exacerbated effects after discontinuation of treatment. 
For patients who discontinued the clinical studies early, no systemic allergic reaction events, accidental 
exposures to peanut, or other important safety events were reported in any of the follow-up periods. 
A search of the published literature found no reports that suggest an increased risk of increased 
severity of reactions (i.e. rebound) following discontinuation of food OIT at any point during the 
process. 
As there are no data which address a possible rebound effect in patients, who discontinued treatment, 
CHMP considered that possible rebound effect should be monitored in the follow-on open-label ARC008 
study listed in the RMP. In addition, possible rebound effect after discontinuation of treatment is added 
as an important potential risk in the RMP. Guidance that patients must continue to carry self-injectable 
adrenaline at all times if treatment with Palforzia is stopped is also added in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Use during pregnancy 
Patients who were pregnant were not treated with Palforzia in the clinical studies. Potential symptoms 
and signs of anaphylaxis and systemic allergic reactions in pregnancy include intense itching in the 
vulvar and vaginal areas, low back pain, uterine cramps, foetal distress, and preterm labour. 
Anaphylaxis can cause a dangerous decrease in blood pressure, which could result in compromised 
placental perfusion and significant risk to a foetus during pregnancy. In addition, the effect of Palforzia 
on the immune system of the mother and foetus during pregnancy is unknown. Therefore, a statement 
that indicate that there are no data on the clinical experience of Palforzia in pregnant women is 
Assessment report

Page 101/102 
 
 
  
included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. A warning that Palforzia should not be initiated during pregnancy 
is also included in section 4.6 of the SmPC and guidance for the patient not to start treatment with 
Palforzia if she is pregnant or planning to become pregnant and to ask her doctor for advice is included 
in section 2 of the package leaflet. Guidance for a benefit/risk assessment to be undertaken for 
patients established on OIT therapy and who become pregnant considering the benefits of OIT and 
retaining desensitisation and the risks of an anaphylactic reaction while remaining on OIT is also 
included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. Use during pregnancy is listed as a missing information in the RMP 
and pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women exposed to Palforzia ascertained by spontaneous 
reporting will be monitored in a post-marketing pregnancy registry as listed in the RMP. 
Impact on long-term immune-mediated reactions 
Long-term data on the incidence of immune-mediated reactions such as anaphylactic reactions and 
eosinophilic esophagitis are available for 104 subjects and 26 subjects who completed 12 and 18 
months respectively of Palforzia maintenance treatment with the ongoing therapeutic dose (300 mg 
daily) through participation in both ARC003 and the open-label, follow-on ARC004 study. The impact 
on long-term immune-mediated reactions beyond this period are limited. Therefore this safety 
concerns is listed as missing information in the RMP and the impact on long-term immune-mediated 
reactions will be further characterised through the open label, longer-term follow-on study (ARC008) 
that will evaluate safety data for patients who have received as much as 5-years total treatment and a 
subsequent 1-year follow-up observation.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
As most peanut allergic patients react to minimal amounts of peanut proteins (according to literature 
to an median amount of 125 mg (Mirabel study)) tolerating 300 mg might be the minimal threshold in 
DBPCFC considered a clinically relevant effect as this value is above most labelled traces of peanut 
protein in pre-packaged food. Tolerating 1000 mg peanut protein will enhance the clinical relevance to 
an important level as amounts of peanut protein in self-made food may be higher than 300 mg (e.g. 
baked goods may even contain little pieces of peanut). If the patients react to an unintended peanut 
intake, it is highly relevant, how severe the allergic symptoms are and if epinephrine is needed to 
control symptoms. Therefore, decreasing the level of severity of symptoms and need for epinephrine 
use are very important. 
Importance of favourable effects 
The most important favourable effect observed is the improvement in toleration of peanut protein with 
no more than mild symptom at the exit DBPCFC. Slightly above 50% of patients tolerate a single dose 
of 1000 mg peanut protein, nearly 70% of patients a single dose of 600 mg and about 75% a single 
dose of 300 mg. Further important favourable effects were the decrease in the maximum severity of 
symptoms at the exit DBPCFC and the decrease in epinephrine use as rescue medication during the 
DBPCFC (ARC003 baseline 36,1 % vs. exit 9,5% subjects need epinephrine; ARC010 baseline 20,8% 
vs. exit 2,8% of subjects need epinephrine).  
The evidence of efficacy was considered statistically convincing and there is good concordance among 
efficacy endpoints. 
Importance of unfavourable effects 
The most unfavourable effects during OIT are (severe) systemic allergic reactions (including 
anaphylaxis), which may be life-threatening. During the clinical studies, the risk of anaphylaxis was 
higher in the Palforzia groups than placebo groups. Patients aged 12 years or older and/or with high 
sensitivity to peanut may be at higher risk of experiencing allergic symptoms during treatment. 
Patients are more likely to experience allergic symptoms in the presence of certain co-factors which 
are known to increase the likelihood of allergic reactions in general. Furthermore, non-adherence to 
daily treatment, also during subsequent years of maintenance, seems to increase the risk of adverse 
allergic reactions. 
The second most unfavourable effects were the overall high rate of allergic reactions occurring during 
treatment (especially impacting the gastrointestinal tract including eosinophilic oesophagitis). The 
induction of allergic reactions due to daily contact with the allergen is expected, as well as the 
observation that adverse events were in general higher during up-dosing than initial dose escalation 
and maintenance. 
For chronic/recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, especially upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, 
vomiting, dysphagia), the potential for a diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis should be considered. 
In patients who experience severe or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, including dysphagia, 
gastroesophageal reflux, chest pain, or abdominal pain, treatment must be discontinued and a 
diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis should be considered.

In order to reduce the risk of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and eosinophilic oesophagitis 
appropriate warning and guidelines on management of co-factors have been included in the product 
information. Anaphylaxis/systemic allergic reactions and eosinophilic oesophagitis are listed as an 
important identified risk in the RMP and will be followed as additional pharmacovigilance activities in 
the ongoing open-label extension for maintenance of desensitization and safety study (ARC008). In 
addition, both risks are reflected in the healthcare professional education materials and patient and 
parent/caregiver educational materials. This was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
So far, no licensed therapeutic option is available for people with peanut allergy in the EU. Current 
standard of care includes strict avoidance of peanut and education of the patient and family on the 
recognition and management of allergy symptoms and appropriate use of rescue medications (e.g., 
antihistamines, epinephrine auto-injectors). The goal of continuous Palforzia treatment in a regimented 
OIT protocol is to induce and maintain a state of desensitization to peanut protein that is sufficient to 
reduce the incidence and severity of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients with peanut 
allergy after exposure to peanut. 
A favorable treatment effect in the indicated age group of 4-17 years of age has been shown by 
several endpoints, statistically robust and clinically relevant. Patients who keep up the treatment up to 
and throughout the maintenance phase showed a very convincing increase in their individual threshold 
of reactivity against peanut protein. Therefore, patients treated with Palforzia may continue the 
treatment when they become 18 years of age and older. First data – however limited – on quality of 
life substantiate that this effect is clinically relevant and may reduce stress and anxiety connected with 
peanut allergy. Efficacy data are currently available for up to 24 months of treatment with Palforzia. No 
recommendation can be made about the duration of treatment beyond 24 months. The effect of 
stopping treatment on maintenance of clinical efficacy or on disease modification has not been 
evaluated. Palforzia should strictly be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet. 
A high risk of allergic reactions – up to anaphylaxis – was observed due to the intake of peanut protein 
to which the patients are allergic. Thus, according to the current data, allergic reactions due to the 
intake of Palforzia (and thus exposure to peanut) are more frequent than in the control group staying 
on strict avoidance of peanut.  
However, the CHMP considered that the risks are adequately described in the product information and 
adequate risk minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are included in the RMP. 
Long-term data on the maintenance of desensitization and safety will be further assessed in the open-
label extension study ARC008. The study will also monitor the safety concerns of anaphylaxis/systemic 
allergic reactions, eosinophilic oesophagitis, possible rebound after discontinuation of treatment and 
impact on long-term immune-mediated reactions.  
Therefore, CHMP considered that the favorable effects observed in the treatment of patients aged 4 to 
17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut allergy and in the continuation of treatment in patients 
turning 18 years during treatment outweigh the unfavorable effects. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Palforzia is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Palforzia is favourable in the following indication: 
Palforzia is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 4 to 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of 
peanut allergy. Palforzia may be continued in patients 18 years of age and older. 
Palforzia should be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet.

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that defatted powder of Arachis 
hypogaea L., semen (peanuts), which have some differences in molecular structure, nature of the 
source material or manufacturing process, does not differ significantly in properties with regard to 
safety and/or efficacy from previously authorised medicinal products within the European Union and 
therefore is not considered to be a new active substance.

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0114/2019 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

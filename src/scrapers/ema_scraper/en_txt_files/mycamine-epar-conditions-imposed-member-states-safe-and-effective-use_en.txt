CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE 
OF MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES 
The Member States should ensure that all conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and 
effective use of the medicinal product described below i.e. the details of a prescription checklist are 
implemented: 
•  Mycamine is contra-indicated if the patient has a history of hypersensitivity to micafungin, 
other echinocandins or excipients. 
•  Mycamine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
•  Caution must be demonstrated if the patient: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
has severe liver function impairment 
has chronic liver diseases known to represent preneoplastic conditions (e.g. advanced liver 
fibrosis, cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, neonatal liver disease or congenital enzyme defects) 
is receiving a concomitant therapy including hepatotoxic and/or genotoxic properties 
is receiving concomitant therapy with amphotericin B desoxycholate 
has history of haemolysis, haemolytic anaemia or renal impairment. 
•  Patients receiving sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole in combination with Mycamine should 
be monitored for sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole toxicity and the sirolimus, nifedipine or 
itraconazole dosage should be reduced if necessary.  
•  Patients should be carefully monitored for liver damage and for worsening of renal function.

ALT/AST is recommended.

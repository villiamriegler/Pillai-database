CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
In adult females: 
Puregon is indicated for the treatment of female infertility in the following clinical situations: 
• 
Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS) in women who have been 
unresponsive to treatment with clomifene citrate. 
Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation to induce the development of multiple follicles in 
medically assisted reproduction programs [e.g. in vitro fertilisation/embryo transfer (IVF/ET), 
gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)]. 
• 
In adult males: 
• 
Deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Puregon should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of fertility problems. 
The first injection with Puregon should be performed under direct medical supervision. 
Posology 
Dosage in the female 
There are great inter- and intra-individual variations in the response of the ovaries to exogenous 
gonadotrophins. This makes it impossible to set a uniform dosage scheme. The dosage should, 
therefore, be adjusted individually depending on the ovarian response. This requires ultrasound 
assessment of follicular development. The concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may 
also be useful. 
When using the pen-injector, it should be realised that the pen is a precision device which accurately 
delivers the dose to which it is set. It was shown that on average an 18% higher amount of FSH is 
given with the pen compared with a conventional syringe. This may be of particular relevance when 
switching between the pen-injector and a conventional syringe within one treatment cycle. Especially 
when switching from a syringe to the pen, small dose adjustments may be needed to prevent too high a 
dose being given. 
Based on the results of comparative clinical studies, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total 
dosage of Puregon over a shorter treatment period
order to optimise follicular development but also to reduce the risk of unwanted ovarian 
hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). 
Clinical experience with Puregon is based on up to three treatment cycles in both indications. Overall 
experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first 
four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.

Anovulation 
A sequential treatment scheme is recommended starting with daily administration of 50 IU 
Puregon. The starting dose is maintained for at least seven days. If there is no ovarian response, 
the daily dose is then gradually increased until follicle growth and/or plasma oestradiol levels 
indicate an adequate pharmacodynamic response. A daily increase of oestradiol levels of 
40-100% is considered to be optimal. The daily dose is then maintained until pre-ovulatory 
conditions are reached. Pre-ovulatory conditions are reached when there is ultrasonographic 
evidence of a dominant follicle of at least 18 mm in diameter and/or when plasma oestradiol 
levels of 300-900 picograms/mL (1,000-3,000 pmol/L) are attained. Usually, 7 to 14 days of 
treatment is sufficient to reach this state. The administration of Puregon is then discontinued and 
ovulation can be induced by administering human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).  
If the number of responding follicles is too high or oestradiol levels increase too rapidly, i.e. 
more than a daily doubling for oestradiol for two or three consecutive days, the daily dose 
should be decreased.  
Since follicles of over 14 mm may lead to pregnancies, multiple pre-ovulatory follicles 
exceeding 14 mm carry the risk of multiple gestations. In that case hCG should be withheld and 
pregnancy should be avoided to prevent multiple gestations. 
Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in medically assisted reproduction programs 
Various stimulation protocols are applied. A starting dose of 100-225 IU is recommended for at 
least the first four days. Thereafter, the dose may be adjusted individually, based upon ovarian 
response. In clinical studies it was shown that maintenance dosages ranging from 75-375 IU for 
six to twelve days are sufficient, although longer treatment may be necessary. 
Puregon can be given either alone, or, to prevent premature luteinisation, in combination with a 
GnRH agonist or antagonist. When using a GnRH agonist, a higher total treatment dose of 
Puregon may be required to achieve an adequate follicular response. 
Ovarian response is monitored by ultrasound assessment. The concurrent determination of 
serum oestradiol levels may also be useful. When ultrasound assessment indicates the presence 
of at least three follicles of 16-20 mm, and there is evidence of a good oestradiol response 
(plasma levels of about 300-400 picograms/mL (1,000-1,300 pmol/L) for each follicle with a 
diameter greater than 18 mm), the final phase of maturation of the follicles is induced by 
administration of hCG. Oocyte retrieval is performed 34-35 hours later. 
Dosage in the male 
Puregon should be given at a dosage of 450 IU/week, preferably divided in 3 dosages of 150 IU, 
concomitantly with hCG. Treatment with Puregon and hCG should be continued for at least 3 to 
4 months before any improvement in spermatogenesis can be expected. To assess the response, semen 
analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment. If a patient has not responded 
after this period, the combination therapy may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that 
treatment for up to 18 months or longer may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Puregon in the paediatric population for the approved indication. 
Method of administration 
Puregon solution for injection in cartridges has been developed for use in the Puregon Pen and should 
be administered subcutaneously. The injection site should be alternated to prevent lipoatrophy. 
Using the pen, injection of Puregon can be carried out by the patient, provided that proper instructions 
are given by the physician. Before using the pen, the instructions for use must be read carefully.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions 
• 
Puregon may contain traces of streptomycin and/or neomycin. These antibiotics may cause 
hypersensitivity reactions in susceptible persons. 
Infertility evaluation before starting treatment 
• 
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate. In particular, 
patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical insufficiency, 
hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment 
given. 
In females 
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement. Clinical signs and 
symptoms of mild and moderate OHSS are abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, mild to moderate 
enlargement of ovaries and ovarian cysts. Severe OHSS may be life-threatening. Clinical signs and 
symptoms of severe OHSS are large ovarian cysts, acute abdominal pain, ascites, pleural effusion, 
hydrothorax, dyspnoea, oliguria, haematological abnormalities and weight gain. In rare instances, 
venous or arterial thromboembolism may occur in association with OHSS. Transient liver function test 
abnormalities suggestive of hepatic dysfunction with or without morphologic changes on liver biopsy 
have also been reported in association with OHSS. 
OHSS may be caused by administration of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and by pregnancy 
(endogenous hCG). Early OHSS usually occurs within 10 days after hCG administration and may be 
associated with an excessive ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation. Late OHSS occurs more 
than 10 days after hCG administration, as a consequence of the hormonal changes with pregnancy. 
Because of the risk of developing OHSS, patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after 
hCG administration. 
Women with known risk factors for a high ovarian response may be especially prone to the 
development of OHSS during or following treatment with Puregon. For women having their first cycle 
of ovarian stimulation, for whom risk factors are only partially known, close observation for early 
signs and symptoms of OHSS is recommended. 
Follow current clinical practice for reducing the risk of OHSS during Assisted Reproductive 
Technology (ART). Adherence to the recommended Puregon dose and treatment regimen and careful 
monitoring of ovarian response is important to reduce the risk of OHSS. To monitor the risk of OHSS, 
ultrasonographic assessments of follicular development should be performed prior to treatment and at 
regular intervals during treatment; the concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may also be 
useful. In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with 18 or more follicles of 11 mm or more in 
diameter.  
If OHSS develops, standard and appropriate management of OHSS should be implemented and 
followed. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Multiple Pregnancy 
Multiple pregnancies and births have been reported for all gonadotropin treatments, including 
Puregon. Multiple gestation, especially high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal 
(pregnancy and delivery complications) and perinatal (low birth weight) outcomes. For anovulatory 
women undergoing ovulation induction, monitoring follicular development with transvaginal 
ultrasonography may aid in determining whether or not to continue the cycle in order to reduce the 
risk of multiple pregnancies. The concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may also be 
useful. The patients should be advised of the potential risks of multiple births before starting 
treatment. 
In women undergoing Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART) procedures, the risk of a multiple 
pregnancy is mainly related to the number of embryos transferred. When used for an ovulation 
induction cycle, appropriate FSH dose adjustment(s) should prevent multiple follicle development. 
Ectopic Pregnancy 
Infertile women undergoing ART have an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancies. Early 
ultrasound confirmation that a pregnancy is intrauterine is therefore important. 
Spontaneous Abortion 
Rates of pregnancy loss in women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques are higher than in the 
normal population. 
Vascular Complications 
Thromboembolic events, both in association with and separate from OHSS, have been reported 
following treatment with gonadotropins, including Puregon. Intravascular thrombosis, which may 
originate in venous or arterial vessels, can result in reduced blood flow to vital organs or the 
extremities. In women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as a 
personal or family history, severe obesity or thrombophilia, treatment with gonadotropins, including 
Puregon, may further increase this risk. In these women the benefits of gonadotropin administration, 
including Puregon, need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted, however, that pregnancy 
itself also carries an increased risk of thrombosis. 
Congenital Malformations 
The incidence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g., maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple gestations. 
Ovarian Torsion 
Ovarian torsion has been reported after treatment with gonadotropins, including Puregon. Ovarian 
torsion may be associated with other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal 
surgery, past history of ovarian torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovaries. 
Damage to the ovary due to reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate 
detorsion. 
Ovarian and Other Reproductive System Neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is 
not established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the risk of these tumours in 
infertile women. 
Other Medical Conditions 
Medical conditions that contraindicate pregnancy should also be evaluated before starting treatment 
with Puregon. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In males 
Primary Testicular Failure 
Elevated endogenous FSH levels in men are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are 
unresponsive to Puregon/hCG therapy. 
Benzyl alcohol 
Benzyl alcohol may cause anaphylactoid reactions. 
Large amounts of benzyl alcohol may cause metabolic acidosis. Special precautions should be taken 
when prescribing Puregon to pregnant or breast-feeding women and patients with liver or kidney 
disease.  
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of Puregon and clomifene citrate may enhance the follicular response. After pituitary 
desensitisation induced by a GnRH agonist, a higher dose of Puregon may be necessary to achieve an 
adequate follicular response. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Fertility 
Puregon is used in the treatment of women undergoing ovarian induction or controlled ovarian 
hyperstimulation in assisted reproduction programmes. In males Puregon is used in the treatment of 
deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. For posology and method of 
administration, see section 4.2. 
Pregnancy 
The use of Puregon during pregnancy is not indicated. In case of inadvertent exposure during 
pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant FSH. 
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported. No teratogenic effect has been 
observed in animal studies.  
Breast-feeding 
There is no information available from clinical or animal studies on the excretion of follitropin beta in 
milk. It is unlikely that follitropin beta is excreted in human milk due to its high molecular weight. If 
follitropin beta would be excreted in human milk, it would be degraded in the gastrointestinal tract of 
the child. Follitropin beta may affect milk production. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Puregon has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Clinical use of Puregon by the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes may lead to local reactions at the 
site of injection (3% of all patients treated). The majority of these local reactions are mild and transient 
in nature. Generalised hypersensitivity reactions have been observed uncommonly (approximately 
0.2% of all patients treated with follitropin beta). 
Treatment of females: 
In approximately 4% of the women treated with follitropin beta in clinical trials, signs and symptoms 
related to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) have been reported (see section 4.4). Adverse 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reactions related to this syndrome include pelvic pain and/or congestion, abdominal pain and/or

4.9  Overdose 
No data on acute toxicity of Puregon in humans is available, but the acute toxicity of Puregon and of 
urinary gonadotrophin preparations in animal studies has been shown to be very low. Too high a 
dosage of FSH may lead to hyperstimulation of the ovaries (see section 4.4). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotrophins; 
ATC code: G03G A06. 
Puregon contains a recombinant FSH. This is produced by recombinant DNA technology, using a 
Chinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with the human FSH subunit genes. The primary amino 
acid sequence is identical to that of natural human FSH. Small differences in the carbohydrate chain 
structure are known to exist. 
Mechanism of Action 
FSH is indispensable in normal follicular growth and maturation, and gonadal steroid production. In 
the female the level of FSH is critical for the onset and duration of follicular development, and 
consequently for the timing and number of follicles reaching maturity. Puregon can thus be used to 
stimulate follicular development and steroid production in selected cases of disturbed gonadal 
function. Furthermore Puregon can be used to promote multiple follicular development in medically 
assisted reproduction programs [e.g. in vitro fertilisation/embryo transfer (IVF/ET), gamete intra-
fallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)]. Treatment with Puregon is 
generally followed by administration of hCG to induce the final phase of follicle maturation, 
resumption of meiosis and rupture of the follicle. 
Clinical Efficacy and Safety 
In clinical studies comparing recFSH (follitropin beta) and urinary FSH for controlled ovarian 
stimulation in women participating in an assisted reproduction technology (ART) program and for 
ovulation induction (see tables 1 and 2 below), Puregon was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of 
a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. 
For controlled ovarian stimulation, Puregon resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved at a lower 
total dose and with a shorter treatment period, when compared to urinary FSH.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After subcutaneous administration of Puregon, maximum concentration of FSH is reached within 
about 12 hours. Due to the sustained release from the injection site and the elimination half-life of 
about 40 hours (ranging from 12 to 70 hours), FSH levels remain increased for 24-48 hours. Due to the 
relatively long elimination half-life, repeated administration of the same dose will lead to plasma 
concentrations of FSH that are approximately 1.5-2.5 times higher than after single-dose 
administration. This increase enables therapeutic FSH concentrations to be reached. 
The absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously administered Puregon is approximately 77%.  
Distribution, biotransformation and elimination 
Recombinant FSH is biochemically very similar to urinary human FSH and is distributed, 
metabolised, and excreted in the same way. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Single-dose administration of Puregon to rats induced no toxicologically significant effects. In 
repeated-dose studies in rats (two weeks) and dogs (13 weeks) up to 100-fold the maximal human 
dose, Puregon induced no toxicologically significant effects. Puregon showed no mutagenic potential 
in the Ames test and in the in vitro chromosome aberration test with human lymphocytes.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Puregon is and what it is used for  
Puregon solution for injection contains follitropin beta, a hormone known as follicle-stimulating 
hormone (FSH). 
FSH belongs to the group of gonadotrophins, which play an important role in human fertility and 
reproduction. In women, FSH is needed for the growth and development of follicles in the ovaries. 
Follicles are small round sacs that contain the egg cells. In men, FSH is needed for the production of 
sperm.  
Puregon is used to treat infertility in any of the following situations: 
Women 
In women who do not ovulate and do not respond to treatment with clomifene citrate, Puregon can be 
used to cause ovulation.  
In women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and other 
methods, Puregon can bring about the development of multiple follicles.  
Men 
In men who are infertile due to lowered hormone levels, Puregon can be used for the production of 
sperm.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Puregon  
Do not use Puregon  
If you:  
• 
• 
are allergic to follitropin beta or any of the other ingredients of Puregon (listed in section 6) 
have a tumour of the ovary, breast, uterus, testis or brain (pituitary gland or hypothalamus) 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
have heavy or irregular vaginal bleeding where the cause is unknown 
have ovaries that do not work because of a condition called primary ovarian failure 
have ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries not caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) 
have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible 
have fibroid tumours in the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible 
are a man and are infertile because of a condition called primary testicular failure. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using Puregon if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
have had an allergic reaction to certain antibiotics (neomycin and/or streptomycin) 
have uncontrolled pituitary gland or hypothalamic problems 
have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) 
have adrenal glands that are not working properly (adrenocortical insufficiency) 
have high prolactin levels in the blood (hyperprolactinemia) 
have any other medical conditions (for example, diabetes, heart disease, or any other long-term 
disease). 
If you are a woman: 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
Your doctor will check the effects of the treatment regularly to be able to choose the correct dose of 
Puregon from day to day. You may regularly have ultrasound scans of the ovaries. Your doctor may 
also check blood hormone levels. This is very important since too high a dose of FSH may lead to rare 
but serious complications in which the ovaries are overly stimulated and the growing follicles become 
larger than normal. This serious medical condition is called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
(OHSS). In rare cases, severe OHSS may be life-threatening. OHSS causes fluid to build-up suddenly 
in your stomach and chest areas and can cause blood clots to form. Call your doctor right away if you 
notice severe abdominal swelling, pain in the stomach area (abdomen), feeling sick (nausea), 
vomiting, sudden weight gain due to fluid build-up, diarrhoea, decreased urine output or trouble 
breathing (see also section 4 on Possible side effects). 
→ Regular monitoring of the response to FSH-treatment helps to prevent ovarian overstimulation. 
Contact your doctor immediately if you are experiencing stomach pains, also if this occurs some days 
after the last injection has been given. 
Multiple pregnancy or birth defects 
After treatment with gonadotrophin preparations, there is an increased chance of having multiple 
pregnancies, even when only one embryo is transferred into the uterus. Multiple pregnancies carry an 
increased health risk for both the mother and her babies around the time of birth. Furthermore, 
multiple pregnancies and characteristics of the patients undergoing fertility treatment (e.g. age of the 
female, sperm characteristics, genetic background of both parents) may be associated with an 
increased risk of birth defects.  
Pregnancy complications 
There is a slightly increased risk of a pregnancy outside the uterus (an ectopic pregnancy). Therefore, 
your doctor should perform an early ultrasound examination to exclude the possibility of pregnancy 
outside the uterus. 
In women undergoing fertility treatment there may be a slightly higher chance of a miscarriage. 
Blood clot (Thrombosis) 
Treatment with Puregon, just as pregnancy itself, may increase the risk of having a blood clot 
(thrombosis). Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel. 
Blood clots can lead to serious medical conditions, such as:  
• 
blockage in your lungs (pulmonary embolus) 
• 
stroke 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
heart attack 
blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis) 
a lack of blood flow (deep venous thrombosis) that may result in a loss of your arm or leg. 
Please discuss this with your doctor, before starting treatment, especially: 
• 
• 
• 
if you already know you have an increased chance of having thrombosis 
if you, or anyone in your immediate family, have ever had a thrombosis 
if you are severely overweight. 
Ovarian torsion 
Ovarian torsion has occurred after treatment with gonadotropins including Puregon. Ovarian torsion is 
the twisting of an ovary. Twisting of the ovary could cause the blood flow to the ovary to be cut off.  
Before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
have ever had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome OHSS 
are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant 
have ever had stomach (abdominal) surgery 
have ever had a twisting of an ovary 
have past or current cysts in your ovary or ovaries. 
Ovarian and other reproductive system tumours 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who have had 
infertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increases the risk of these 
tumours in infertile women. 
Other medical conditions 
In addition, before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you: 
• 
have been told by a doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you.  
If you are a man: 
Men with too much FSH in their blood 
Increased FSH blood levels are a sign of damage to the testicles. Puregon is usually not effective in 
such cases. To check the effects of treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen sample to be 
analysed, four to six months after the start of treatment. 
Children and adolescents  
There is no relevant use of Puregon in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Puregon  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
If Puregon is used in a combination with clomifene citrate, the effect of Puregon may be increased. If a 
GnRH agonist (a medicine used to prevent early ovulation) has been given, higher doses of Puregon 
may be needed. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. You should not use Puregon if 
you are already pregnant, or think you might be pregnant. 
Puregon may affect milk production. It is unlikely that Puregon is passed into breast milk. If you are 
breast-feeding, tell your doctor before using Puregon.  
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Puregon is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Puregon contains benzyl alcohol 
This medicinal product contains 10 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL.  
Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.  
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you have a liver or kidney disease. This is because large 
amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called “metabolic 
acidosis”). 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. This is because large 
amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called “metabolic 
acidosis”). 
Puregon contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Puregon  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  
Dosage in women 
Your doctor will decide on your starting dose. This dose may be adjusted during your treatment 
period. Further details on the treatment schedule are given below.  
There are large differences between women in the response of the ovaries to FSH, which makes it 
impossible to set a dosage schedule which is suitable for all patients. To find the right dosage, your 
doctor will check your follicle growth by means of ultrasound scanning, and measurement of the 
amount of oestradiol (female sex hormone) in the blood. 
*  Women who are not ovulating 
A starting dose is set by your doctor. This dose is continued for at least seven days. If there is no 
ovarian response, the daily dose will then be gradually increased until follicle growth and/or 
plasma oestradiol levels indicate a proper response. The daily dose is then maintained until a 
follicle of proper size is present. Usually, 7 to 14 days of treatment are sufficient. Puregon 
treatment is then stopped and ovulation will be induced by giving human chorionic 
gonadotrophin (hCG).  
*  Medically assisted reproduction programs, for instance IVF 
A starting dose is set by your doctor. This dose is continued for at least the first four days. After 
this, your dose may be adjusted, based upon your ovarian response. When a sufficient number of 
follicles of proper size are present, the final phase of maturation of the follicles is induced by 
giving hCG. Retrieval of the egg(s) is performed 34-35 hours later.  
Dosage in men 
Puregon is usually prescribed at a dose of 450 IU per week, mostly in 3 dosages of 150 IU, in 
combination with another hormone (hCG), for at least 3 to 4 months. The treatment period equals the 
development time of sperm and the time in which improvement can be expected. If your sperm 
production has not started after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.

How are the injections given 
Puregon solution for injection in cartridges has been developed for use in the Puregon Pen. The 
separate instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully. Do not use the cartridge if the 
solution contains particles or if the solution is not clear.  
Using the pen, injections just under the skin (in the lower stomach, for example) can be given by 
yourself or your partner. Your doctor will tell you when and how to do this. If you inject yourself with 
Puregon, follow the instructions carefully to give Puregon properly and with minimal discomfort.  
The very first injection of Puregon should only be given in the presence of a doctor or nurse.  
A small amount of the medicine may remain in the cartridge after the treatment with Puregon is 
completed even when all doses have been correctly given. Do not try to use any remaining medicine. 
After administration of the last dose, the cartridge must be properly discarded. 
If you use more Puregon than you should 
Tell your doctor immediately. 
Too high a dose of Puregon may cause hyperstimulation of the ovaries (OHSS). This may be noticed 
as pain in the stomach. If you are troubled by stomach pains, tell your doctor immediately. See also 
section 4 on possible side effects.  
If you forget to use Puregon  
If you forget a dose do not use a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  
→ Contact your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Serious side effects in women  
A complication with FSH treatment is hyperstimulation of the ovaries. Ovarian overstimulation may 
develop into a medical condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can be 
a serious medical problem. The risk can be reduced by careful monitoring of follicular development 
during treatment. Your doctor will do ultrasound scans of your ovaries to carefully monitor the 
number of maturing follicles. Your doctor may also check blood hormone levels. Pain in the stomach, 
feeling sick or diarrhoea are the first symptoms. In more severe cases symptoms may include 
enlargement of the ovaries, accumulation of fluid in the abdomen and/or chest (which may cause 
sudden weight gain due to fluid buildup) and the occurrence of blood clots in the circulation. See 
warnings and precautions in section 2.  
→ Contact your doctor immediately if you are experiencing stomach pains, or any of the other 
symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation, also if this occurs some days after the last injection.

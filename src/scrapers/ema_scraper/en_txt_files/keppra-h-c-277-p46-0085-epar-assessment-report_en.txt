Scientific discussion 
Information on the development program 
N01361 was designed as an open-label, long-term, and multicenter study conducted in Japan to 
provide subjects who completed either N01159 or N01363, or who discontinued N01159 due to lack of 
efficacy, with the opportunity to continue LEV treatment in an open-label manner. This study was 
planned to be conducted until the date of market approval (i.e., 29 Feb 2016) or completion of 
development of LEV for the GTC seizure indication. As soon as an approval for the GTC seizure 
indication was granted, all subjects were to complete a Closeout Visit and to fulfil all obligations of the 
protocol-defined activities in order to formally bring closure to the study at the institution. The 
Closeout Visit was to be made within 3 months from the approval date. 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Levetiracetam for oral administration was as follows: 
 
 
 
Clinical aspects 
Description of the study 
Title:  
“An open-label, multicenter, long-term follow-up study in Japan to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of adjunctive treatment with oral L059 (levetiracetam) in epilepsy subjects with generalized 
tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures 
Sponsor protocol number: N01361” 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of the study were the following: 
  To provide the LEV treatment to epilepsy subjects in Japan who were judged to benefit from 
continued treatment with LEV by the investigators and who were willing to continuously receive 
this drug. 
  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term administration of LEV at doses up to   
60mg/kg/day or 3000mg/day in subjects with epilepsy in Japan who had completed N01363 
(This study included Japanese pediatric subjects aged >4 to <16 years with uncontrolled GTC 
seizures; note from the Rapporteur) or N01159 (This study included epilepsy patients aged 
≥16 years with generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures; note from the Rapporteur) or had 
discontinued N01159, due to lack of efficacy. 
The secondary objectives were the following: 
  To evaluate the efficacy of long-term administration of LEV at doses up to 60mg/kg/day or 
3000mg/day in subjects with epilepsy in Japan who had completed N01159 or N01363 or who 
had discontinued N01159 due to lack of efficacy. 
 
Study design 
N01361 was an open-label follow-up of N01159 and N01363 and was designed to assess the long-term 
safety and efficacy of oral LEV in Japanese subjects aged ≥4 years with GTC seizures. This study 
consisted of the following periods: 
 Ev a lu a t io n  Pe r io d  
A visit was scheduled every 12 weeks. However, Visits 1 through 4 occurred at 4-week intervals for the 
subjects from N01159 to ensure subjects’ safety. The dose and duration of exposure to LEV in the 
subjects from N01159 were not disclosed at the time of entry in this study, due to blinding of N01159. 
Visit 2 and Visit 3 allowed the subjects from N01159 to be monitored by the investigators. The subjects 
from N01363 did not have to complete Visit 2 and Visit 3. 
All subjects initially received open-label LEV treatment at the prescribed dose of the feeder studies, 
N01159 or N01363. 
Once the dose and mode of administration of the concomitant AED(s) were stable for the 4 consecutive 
weeks prior to the Evaluation Period, the AED was to be continued at the same dose and then the dose 
of LEV was adjusted at the investigator’s discretion in the range from 20mg/kg/day or 1000mg/day to 
60mg/kg/day or 3000mg/day during this period. The investigators increased or decreased the dose for 
a 2-week interval or longer, when a dose adjustment was necessary. Each increase or decrease in the 
dose was not to exceed 20mg/kg/day or 1000mg/day for the 2-week interval. 
 Wit h d r a w a l Pe r io d  
A subject entered the Withdrawal Period when the subject or investigators decided to discontinue 
treatment with LEV. This period consisted of a Down-Titration Period and a Follow-Up Period. 
 Do w n -Titration Period 
The dose of LEV was reduced as gradually as possible to ensure the subject’s safety. The 
recommended dose decrement was 1000mg/day or 20mg/kg/day for a 2-week interval or longer as 
follows. The 3000mg/day or 60mg/kg/day dosage was decreased to 2000mg/day or 40mg/kg/day for 
the first 2 weeks and then the dosage was decreased again to 1000mg/day or 20mg/kg/day for 2 
additional weeks. The 2000mg/day or 40mg/kg/day dose was decreased to 1000mg/day or 
20mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, and then LEV treatment was discontinued. The 1000mg/day or 
 
20mg/kg/day dose was immediately discontinued without down-titration at the time the 
discontinuation was decided. 
 Fo llo w -Up Period (2 weeks) 
The subject entered the Follow-Up Period, when the last dose of LEV was administered. A final visit 
was required for all subjects at any time during the 2 weeks after the last dose of LEV. 
The planned study duration was from May 2011 until the date of approval of LEV treatment for the GTC 
seizure indication and until the time when the sponsor decided to discontinue the development for the 
GTC seizure indication.The study duration for each subject varied depending on the date when the 
individual subject received the first LEV dose in this study. 
Study population /Sample size 
The planned number of subjects for N01361 was the number of the Japanese subjects who had 
completed either N01159 or N01363 in Japan, or who had discontinued N01159 in Japan due to lack of 
efficacy (N01159 included Chinese and Japanese subjects). The number of sites for N01361 
approximately matched the number of sites that enrolled subjects who participated in either N01159 or 
N01363. 
Inclusion criteria: 
To be eligible to participate in this study, all of the following criteria were to be met: 
1. For the subjects from N01159: an IRB-approved written ICF was signed and dated by the subject. If 
the subject was a minor or mentally retarded, the parent(s)/legal representative signed and dated the 
 
 
consent form. A patient who was a minor or mentally retarded, but   judged by the investigator as 
capable of consenting personally signed and dated the ICF or a   specific IRB-approved assent form.    
For the subjects from N01363: an IRB-approved written   informed consent was signed and dated by 
the patient’s parent or legal representative. The   consent form or a specific IRB-approved assent form 
was signed and dated by the patient if   the investigators judged that the subject was capable of 
consenting. 
2. The subject in Japan completed either N01159 or N01363 or discontinued N01159 due to   lack of 
efficacy. 
3. The subject who was judged to benefit from continued treatment with LEV by the   investigators. 
4. Female subjects of childbearing potential (without a history of hysterectomy or bilateral   
oophorectomy) were eligible if they used a medically accepted contraceptive method for the   duration 
of the study participation. They must have understood and accepted that pregnancy   was to be 
avoided during participation in the study. Also, they were to provide a negative   pregnancy test result 
at all Visits to confirm the absence of pregnancy. Female subjects not of   childbearing potential (no 
occurrence of the first menstruation, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal   ligation, or complete 
hysterectomy) were eligible. 
5. The subject and parent(s)/legal representative were considered reliable and capable of   adhering to 
the protocol (e.g., able to understand and complete diaries), visit schedule, or   medication intake 
according to the judgment of the investigator. 
Exclusion criteria: 
Subjects with multiple protocol deviations during N01159 or N01363, such as missing laboratory data, 
and low or noncompliance with the study medication, and who the investigator considered not to have 
the potential to have deviations stopped were ineligible to participate in this study. Subjects meeting 
any of the withdrawal criteria (see Removal of subjects from therapy or assessment) were also 
ineligible. 
Removal of subjects from therapy or assessment 
Subjects were free to withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice to their continued care. 
Subjects were to be withdrawn from the study if any of the following events occurred: 
1. The subject or parent(s)/legal representative withdrew consent to participate in the study for any 
reason. 
2. The subject developed an illness or worsened laboratory test findings that would have led to 
noncompliance with the study procedures or medications. 
3. The subject was found to be ineligible in terms of the efficacy and safety evaluations after the start 
of the study. 
4. The subject developed an adverse event (AE) that would have interfered with his/her continued 
participation. 
5. Confirmation of a pregnancy during the study, as evidenced by a positive pregnancy test. 
6. The subject became lost to follow-up, which would have stopped his/her continued participation. 
7. The subject was noncompliant with the protocol for reasons other than those mentioned above. 
8. The investigators requested withdrawal of the subject at their discretion. 
Treatment 
Tablets and dry syrup for oral administration were used as study treatment. The individual starting 
dose in this study was the same dose prescribed at the end of the Evaluation Period of N01159 or 
N01363. Once the dose and mode of administration of the concomitant AED(s) were stable for the 4 
consecutive weeks prior to the Evaluation Period, the AED was to be continued at the same dose and 
then the LEV dose was increased or decreased at the investigator’s discretion in the dose ranges 
provided in Table 3‒2. A minimum interval of 2 weeks was required for a change in the LEV dose and 
increase or decrease in the LEV dose was not to exceed 20mg/kg/day or 1000mg/day for each 2-week 
interval. Subjects from N01363 who weighed <20kg continued receiving the LEV dry syrup at 
20mg/kg/day to 60mg/kg/day and those who weighed ≥20kg were allowed to choose one of the 
formulations: LEV dry syrup 20mg/kg/day to 60mg/kg/day or LEV tablet 1000mg/day to 3000mg/day. 
The dosage for the dry syrup was determined using the subject’s weight at each visit (please see Table 
 
 
3‒2). The daily dose for the tablet was determined based on the equivalent dosage to dry syrup 
dosage (please see Table 3‒3). 
Please refer to the body text for the study directives regarding concomitant medications.(p20-21). 
Duration of treatment  
The study duration for each subject varied depending on the date when the individual subject received 
the first LEV dose in this study. The study began with an Evaluation Period, which consisted of visits at 
 
 
12-week interval starting from the time of the first LEV dose until the time of determination to 
discontinue LEV treatment or to terminate study participation. The Evaluation Period was followed by 
the Withdrawal Period (2 to 6 weeks), comprising the Down-Titration Period (0 to 4 weeks depending 
on the LEV dose received during the Evaluation Period) and the Follow-Up Period (2 weeks). 
The mean overall duration of exposure to study medication for the Safety Set (SS) was 1098.8 days. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety: The following safety information was collected during the study: 
Adverse events (AEs) 
Serious adverse events,  
The following AEs must have been reported immediately: SAE: 
- AE that the investigator classified as serious by the definition of a SAE (see body 
text)  
regardless of causality  
-Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product 
Laboratory measurements: parameters of hematology, blood biochemistry, and urinalysis 
Other safety measurements: 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, body weight and height 
Efficacy: The efficacy variable was the percentage reduction in GTC seizure frequency per week over 
the Evaluation Period from either of the Combined Baseline Periods of the previous studies (N01159 or 
N01363). 
The epileptic seizures were classified according to (Commission on Classification and Terminology of 
the International League Against Epilepsy [ILAE], 1981). 
The subject, parent(s)/family member, or other people (eg, a legal representative, school teacher, or 
child caregiver, etc) was to commit to recording the following information on the DRCs: date/time of 
the seizure onset, frequency, and symptoms of the seizure, the use of LEV treatment, concomitant 
AEDs, and concomitant non-AEDs, including as-needed medication use and any other symptoms to 
assess the presence of any AEs. The investigator discussed any written information in the DRCs with 
the subject and/or the parent(s)/legal representative at each visit, in order to determine and indicate if 
recorded events were to be considered AEs. As a result of the discussion, the investigator confirmed 
the assessment of the seizure written in the DRCs as well as in any of the source documentation, such 
as medical charts, in addition to entering it into the eCRF. 
The other efficacy variables were as follows: 
1. GTC seizure frequency per week by 12-week window over the Evaluation Period 
2. The percentage reduction from either of the Combined Baseline Periods of the previous studies 
(N01159 or N01363) in GTC seizure frequency per week by 12-week window over the Evaluation 
Period 
3. GTC seizures 50% responder rate (the proportion of subjects with 50% or more reduction from 
either of the Combined Baseline Periods of the previous studies (N01159 or N01363 in the frequency of 
GTC seizures) by 12-week window during the Evaluation Period 
4. GTC seizures 75% responder rate (the proportion of subjects with 75% or more reduction from 
either of the Combined Baseline Periods of the previous studies [N01159 or N01363] in the frequency 
of GTC seizures) by 12-week window during the Evaluation Period. 
5. The cumulative probability of a subject being continuously seizure-free since the beginning of this 
study by 12-week window during the Evaluation Period 
6. The percentage of subjects with 12-week seizure freedom duration at any time during the study 
7. Responder rate in myoclonic seizure days per week. A responder was defined as a subject with a 
>50% reduction in myoclonic seizure days (equal to day[s] with myoclonic seizure[s]) per week from 
either of the Prospective Baseline Periods of the previous studies (N01159 or N01363) to the 
Evaluation Period in this study. 
8. All seizure days per week by 12-week window over the Evaluation Period. 
9. The percentage reduction from either of the Prospective Baseline Periods of the previous studies 
(N01159 or N01363) in all seizure days per week by 12-week window over the Evaluation Period 
Statistical Methods 
Descriptive statistics were used to provide an overview of the primary, secondary, and other variable 
results.  
For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in each category were presented. 
The denominator for percentages was based on the number of subjects that was appropriate for the 
purpose of analysis.  
For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics included the number of subjects, mean, standard 
deviation, median, interquartile range (QI [25th percentile] to Q3 [75th percentile]), minimum, and 
maximum. 
Baseline values for the safety and efficacy analyses in N01361 were the data collected at Baseline of 
the feeder studies, N01159 and N01363. 
All enrolled subjects who signed and dated the informed consent form were included in the ES.  
All safety analyses were performed on the SS. Safety data were presented for subjects by feeder 
study, N01159 or N01363, and for all subjects who enrolled in N01361.  
All efficacy analyses were performed in a descriptive manner for FAS, which was a subset of the SS 
that consisted of all subjects with evaluable Baseline and post-Baseline values of GTC seizure 
frequency as the efficacy analysis. Efficacy data were presented overall and by feeder study for the 
safety analyses as well as by the treatment groups of N01159 (ie, N01159 LEV, N01159 Placebo 
[PBO]). 
Descriptive statistics for exposure duration and mean daily dose of LEV were presented overall, by 
period, and by 12-week window. 
The safety of LEV was the primary endpoint in this study and was assessed via AEs, including ADRs, 
laboratory data, ECG parameters, vital signs, body weight, and height. 
Analysis sets: 
All subjects screened: This set consisted of subjects who signed and dated the ICF and were screened 
for eligibility for this study. 
Enrolled Set (ES): The ES consisted of subjects who enrolled in this study. 
Safety Set (SS): The SS consisted of subjects who received at least 1 (partial) dose of LEV. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS was a subset of the SS, consisting of all subjects with evaluable 
Baseline and post-Baseline values of GTC seizure frequency as the efficacy analysis, and excluded 
those who seriously violated GCP. The FAS was used for the efficacy analyses. 
Results 
Subject disposition 
A total of 44 subjects enrolled in N01361, including 33 subjects from N01159 and 11 subjects from 
N01363. Of the 44 subjects who enrolled in N01361, a majority of subjects reached Week 144 (range 
across Weeks 24 through 144: 68.2% to 95.5%) and approximately half reached Week 168 (52.3%). 
A total of 34 subjects (77.3%) completed the study, and 10 subjects (22.7%) discontinued the study. 
Of the 10 subjects who discontinued, 4 subjects  (9.1%) discontinued due to an adverse event (AE), 4 
subjects (9.1%) withdrew consent, and 2  subjects (4.5%) discontinued for other reasons (‘subject 
moves a long distance from hospital’  and ‘withdrawal criteria #3’). Of the subjects who discontinued 
 
due to an AE, 3 subjects (9.1%) from N01159 and 1 subject (9.1%) from N01363 discontinued due to 
non-serious, nonfatal AEs.  Two additional subjects, withdrew their informed consents to participate in 
N01361 during the feeder study (N01159) and were regarded as feeder study non-completers, who did 
not meet inclusion criterion #2.   
A total of 14 subjects were <18 years old at study entry. Five of these subjects were female; 9 were 
male. All subjects received LEV. 
Safety results 
Overall, a total of 44 subjects received at least 1 LEV dose ranging from 786.8mg/day to 3000mg/day. 
The safety results for this study are as follows: 
The mean overall duration of exposure to study medication was 1098.8 days, and was higher for 
subjects from N01363 (1163.2 days) compared with subjects from N01159 (1077.4 days). The longest 
exposure to LEV in this study was 1708 days (approximately 4.7 years). The mean daily dose of LEV 
overall was 2126.75mg/day, with a lower mean daily dose for paediatric subjects from N01363 
(1723.85mg/day), who were dosed by weight, compared with adult subjects from N01159 
(2261.05mg/day).   
A total of 15 subjects (34.1%) reported pre-treatment AEs (11 subjects [33.3%] from N01159 and 4 
subjects [36.4%] from N01363). The only pre-treatment AE by PT reported by >1 subject overall was 
somnolence (reported by 4 subjects [9.1%]). 
Overall, 43 subjects (97.7%) reported a total of 626 TEAEs during the study, including 32 subjects 
(97.0%) from N01159 and 11 subjects (100%) from N01363. Of the individual TEAEs with an 
incidence of ≥10% overall, the most frequently reported were nasopharyngitis (35 subjects [79.5%]), 
convulsion (16 subjects [36.4%]), and dental caries (11 subjects [25.0%]). There was no clear pattern 
of onset by 12-week window overall or by feeder study for any TEAE with an overall incidence of ≥10% 
across the study duration, with the exception of somnolence (10 subjects [22.7%]) and convulsion. 
During the first 12 weeks of the study, 5 of 10 subjects had the onset of somnolence and 4 of 16 
 
 
 
subjects had the onset of convulsion. Four of the 5 subjects who had somnolence and 0 of 4 subjects 
who experienced convulsion during the first 12 weeks of the study had their first exposure to LEV in 
this study (ie, had received PBO during N01159). 
No deaths occurred during the study. A total of 13 subjects (29.5%) reported 29 SAEs during the 
study, 1 of which was considered related to study medication by the investigator (ADR of breast 
adenoma). The only SAE by PT that was reported by >1 subject was influenza (reported by 2 subjects 
[4.5%]; 1 subject from each feeder study). 
Four subjects (9.1%) discontinued the study due to 5 TEAEs. The only TEAE by PT that led to 
discontinuation of >1 subject was aggression (reported by 2 subjects [4.5%]; 1 subject from each 
feeder study). The TEAEs of aggression, logorrhea, and gait disturbance were considered related to 
study medication by the investigator. 
A total of 22 subjects (50.0%) reported ADRs during the study, including 17 subjects (51.5%) from 
N01159 and 5 subjects (45.5%) from N01363. The only ADRs reported by >1 subject overall were 
somnolence (8 subjects [18.2%]), electrocardiogram QT prolonged (3 subjects [6.8%]), and 
aggression, weight increased, and headache (2 subjects [4.5%] each). The incidence of ADRs 
occurring in >1 subject was low, making it difficult to interpret the onset of ADRs by 12-week window. 
Nevertheless, 5 of the 8 subjects who reported the most frequent ADR of somnolence did so within the 
first 12 weeks. 
 Th e  m a jo r it y  o f TEAEs  were mild (42 subjects [95.5%]) or moderate (23 subjects [52.3%]) in 
intensity. A total of 4 subjects (9.1%) reported 7 severe TEAEs during the study, all of which were 
serious, and none were considered by the investigator to be related to study medication.  
All ADRs were mild (20 subjects [45.5%]) or moderate (7 subjects [15.9%]) in intensity. No severe 
ADRs were reported during the study. 
A total of 8 subjects (18.2%) reported other significant TEAEs in the Psychiatric disorders SOC; 4 of 
these TEAEs were considered to be related to study medication (ADRs of aggression [2 events], 
irritability, and logorrhea). Aggression and stress were reported by 2 subjects (4.5%) each, while 
adjustment disorder, insomnia, irritability, logorrhea, nightmare, and sleep disorder were each 
reported by 1 subject (2.3%). The TEAEs of aggression and logorrhea led to discontinuation from the 
study. None of these TEAEs were serious or severe. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation:  Changes from Baseline in mean and median hematology and blood 
chemistry values did not show any clinically meaningful trends over time and were generally similar 
across feeder studies. Few subjects had hematology or blood chemistry values that shifted from not 
PCS at Baseline to PCS during the study. There were few TEAEs related to abnormal hematology, 
abnormal blood chemistry, or urinalysis values. 
Hematology 
neutrophil count decreased in 1 subject from N01159, and 2 events of white blood cell count decreased 
in 1 subject from N01363 (Table 10.4) were considered related to study medication by the 
investigator. 
Blood chemistry 
hepatic function abnormal was considered related to study medication by the investigator. 
Vital sign measurements over time:  Changes from Baseline in mean and median vital sign values 
(systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body weight, height, and body temperature) were 
generally small. Few shifts in vital sign results from not possibly clinically significant (PCS) at Baseline 
to possibly clinically significant post-Baseline were reported. Few TEAEs related to vital signs were 
reported. The most frequently reported TEAEs related to abnormal vital signs were pyrexia (8 subjects 
 
 
[18.2%]) and weight increased (5 subjects [11.4%]). Of these TEAEs, all were mild in intensity, 
nonserious, did not lead to discontinuation, were considered not related to study medication by the 
investigator, and resolved, with the exception of a TEAE of weight increased in 1 subject that was 
reported as not resolved, and TEAEs of weight increased in 2 subjects that were considered related to 
study medication. 
Electrocardiogram findings: Two subjects from N01363 and 1 subject from N01159 had shifts from 
normal ECG values at Baseline to abnormal, clinically significant post-Baseline ECG values. These were 
all reported as TEAEs (electrocardiogram QT prolonged) and were mild in intensity, nonserious, did not 
lead to discontinuation, were considered related to study medication by the investigator, and resolved. 
Efficacy results 
Percentage reduction in GTC seizure frequency per week over the Evaluation Period: The 
median frequency of GTC seizures per week improved between the Combined Baseline Period and the 
Evaluation Period in N01361 overall and by feeder study. 
The median percentage reduction in GTC seizure frequency per week over the Evaluation Period from 
either of the Combined Baseline Periods of the feeder studies (N01159 or N01363) was 92.07%; the 
median percentage reduction was higher in subjects from N01159 (94.73%) compared with subjects 
from N01363 (64.12%). Subjects from N01363 had a higher median Baseline seizure frequency (1.63 
seizures/week) compared with subjects from N01159 (0.60 seizures/week). 
Percentage reduction in GTC seizure frequency per week by 12-week window over the 
Evaluation Period : The median frequency of GTC seizures per week improved between the 
Combined Baseline Period and the Evaluation Period in N01361 by each 12-week window, overall and 
by feeder study. The median percentage reduction in GTC seizure frequency per week was ≥83.63% in 
 
 
N01361 subjects overall across all 12-week windows during the Evaluation Period.(cf. Table 9.2, 
CSRp.94) 
Table 9-2: Percentage reduction in GTC seizure frequency per week by 12-week window over the 
Evaluation Period for N01361 subjects overall (FAS) 
 
 
50%Responder rate in GTC seizures by 12-week window during the Evaluation Period: The 
GTC seizures 50% responder rate (the proportion of subjects with 50% or more reduction from either 
of the Combined Baseline Periods of the feeder studies [N01159 or N01363] in the frequency of GTC 
seizures) was ≥67.4% in N01361 subjects overall across all 12-week windows during the Evaluation 
Period. (cf. Table 9.3, CSRp.98) 
Table  9-3: 50%responder rate in GTC seizures by 12-week window during the Evaluation Period (FAS) 
Responder rate at 75% in GTC seizures by 12-week window during the Evaluation Period: 
The GTC seizures 75% responder rate (the proportion of subjects with 75% or more reduction from 
either of the Combined Baseline Periods of the feeder studies [N01159 or N01363] in the frequency of 
GTC seizures) was ≥58.5% in N01361 subjects overall across all 12-week windows during the 
Evaluation Period.( cf. Table 8.1.4 , tables p149) 
 
 
Cumulative probability of seizure freedom by 12-week window during the Evaluation Period:  
The cumulative probability of a subject being continuously seizure-free since the beginning of this 
study by 12-week window during the Evaluation Period decreased from 34.73% at 12 weeks to 
14.88% from 108 weeks onward. (cf. Table 8.1.5., tables p155) 
Subjects with 12-week seizure freedom duration at any time during the study (FAS):  The 
percentage of subjects with 12-week seizure freedom at any time during the study was 65.1% for 
N01361 subjects overall; the 12-week seizure freedom percentage was higher in the subjects from 
N01159 (71.9%) compared with the subjects from N01363 (45.5%). 
myoclonic seizures 50% Responder rate over the Evaluation Period:  Regarding the responder 
rate in myoclonic seizure days per week, the 1 subject who experienced myoclonic seizures achieved a 
50% reduction in myoclonic seizure days (equal to days with myoclonic seizures) per week from the 
Prospective Baseline Period of either feeder study (N01159 or N01363) to the Evaluation Period in this 
study. No subjects from N01363 reported myoclonic seizures. (cf. Table 8.1.7., tables p160) 
 
 
All seizure days per week by 12-week window over the Evaluation Period: The median 
frequency of all seizure days per week improved between the Prospective Baseline Period and the 
Evaluation Period over each 12-week window. The median percentage reduction in all seizure days per 
week was ≥80.95% across 12-week windows for N01361 subjects overall. .(cf. Table 9.5, CSRp.101)

Conclusion 
Based on the study results, the following conclusions were made: 
• 
• 
• 
The safety and tolerability of long-term administration of LEV was demonstrated by the safety 
data for the subjects with exposure to LEV for up to approximately 4.7 years. 
There were no new safety concerns for LEV identified in this study and safety data were consistent 
with the established safety profile of LEV. 
Long-term administration of LEV at doses up to 60mg/kg/day or 3000mg/day was effective in 
reducing GTC seizure frequency when used as adjunctive therapy with 1 or 2 other AEDs in 
Japanese subjects aged >4 years. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Applicant: 
Results from N01361 show that long-term administration of LEV at doses up to 60mg/kg/day or 
3000mg/day was effective in reducing GTC seizure frequency when used as adjunctive therapy with 1 
or 2 other AEDs in Japanese subjects aged ≥4 years. 
There were no new safety concerns for LEV identified in this study and safety data were consistent with 
the established safety profile of LEV. 
Levetiracetam dry syrup is not a registered formulation in the EU, so no changes to the approved EU 
Product Information for Keppra are proposed following the completion of this study. At this time, UCB 
considers that the standard immediate-release formulations of Keppra allow for appropriate use of LEV 
in paediatric patients in the EU. UCB is submitting this study in accordance with Article 46 of the 
Paediatric Regulation. 
Recommendation 
At this time, UCB considers that the standard immediate-release formulations of Keppra allow for 
appropriate use of LEV in paediatric patients in the EU. UCB is submitting this study in accordance with 
Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation. 
Rapporteur:  
It should be noted that the indication of the present study, i.e. adjunctive treatment with oral 
levetiracetam in epilepsy patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, is not registered in the EU for 
children > 4 years to 12 years of age, nor is the dry syrup formulation. 
It is agreed that at this time, the standard immediate-release formulations of Keppra allow for 
appropriate use of LEV in paediatric patients in the EU for the in the EU registered indications. 
The Rapporteur endorses the submission of this study in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric 
Regulation, and agrees that there is no impact on the benefit risk balance for the  in the in the EU 
authorized Keppra formulations for the in the EU registered indications. 
As regards the product information, the following undesirable effects were considered to be related 
to the study medication in the present study and are not listed in the SmPC: 
-breast adenoma 
-logorrhea 
-gait disturbance 
-electrocardiogram QT prolonged. 
  
 
Specific safety follow-up of these items is recommended to evaluate if addition of these undesirable 
effects to section 4.8 of the SPC is required. 
Therefore, the Rapporteur recommends that you further consider the impact of the available data 
regarding the undesirable effects  
-breast adenoma 
-logorrhea 
-gait disturbance 
-electrocardiogram QT prolonged on the product information.  
In addition, It is recommended to add a concise summary of the long term efficacy and safety results 
of this study to section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action is required (but is recommended).

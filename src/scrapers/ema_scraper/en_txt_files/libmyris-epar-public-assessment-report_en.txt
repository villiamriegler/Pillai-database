1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant STADA Arzneimittel AG submitted on 11 September 2020 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Libmyris, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 30 January 2020.   
The applicant applied for the following indications: 
Rheumatoid arthritis  
Libmyris in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for:  
• 
• 
the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the 
response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate has been 
inadequate.  
the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously 
treated with methotrexate.  
Libmyris can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued 
treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.  
Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray 
and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Libmyris in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or 
more DMARD. Libmyris can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when 
continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 
5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in patients aged less than 2 years.  
Enthesitis-related arthritis  
Libmyris is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age 
and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy 
(see section 5.1). 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
Libmyris is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active AS who have had an inadequate 
response to conventional therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021  
Page 9/122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS 
Libmyris is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without 
radiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI, who 
have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs). 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Libmyris is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the 
response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the 
rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular 
symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1) and to improve physical function. 
Psoriasis 
Libmyris is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients 
who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Libmyris is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents 
from 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for 
topical therapy and phototherapies. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) 
Libmyris is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne 
inversa) in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional 
systemic HS therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Crohn’s disease 
Libmyris is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients 
who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an 
immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. 
Paediatric Crohn's disease 
Libmyris is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric 
patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including 
primary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or 
have contraindications for such therapies. 
Ulcerative colitis 
Libmyris is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients 
who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-
mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies.

Paediatric ulcerative colitis 
Libmyris is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in paediatric 
patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including 
corticosteroids and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have 
medical contraindications for such therapies. 
Uveitis 
Libmyris is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult 
patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of corticosteroid-
sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. 
Paediatric uveitis 
Libmyris is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients 
from 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, 
or in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate.

authorised in the EU on 08 September 2003, which contains adalimumab as an active substance. 
Adalimumab belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group ‘immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors’ (ATC code: L04AB04). 
Libmyris is a genetically engineered recombinant human immunoglobulin IgG1 monoclonal antibody, 
which binds specifically to tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and neutralizes its biological function 
by inhibiting interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. 
The proposed therapeutic indications and dosages for Libmyris are the same as those approved for EU-
Humira:  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA),  polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (PJIA),  enthesitis-related 
arthritis,  axial  spondyloarthritis  (ankylosing  spondylitis  [AS],  and  axial  spondyloarthritis  without 
radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), adult and paediatric plaque psoriasis (PsO), adult 
and adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), adult and paediatric Crohn’s disease (CD), adult ulcerative 
colitis (UC), adult and paediatric non-infectious uveitis. 
Libmyris is being developed as solution for subcutaneous (s.c.) injection 100 mg/ml and presented as 
40 mg/0.4 ml in a prefilled syringe (PFS) with passive safety device, 40 mg/0.4 ml in a PFS enclosed in 
an auto injector and 80 mg/0.8 ml in a PFS with passive safety device. The strengths are the same as 
those approved for Humira. 
In the posology section 4.2 of the SmPC, the applicant proposes to indicate only those patients with a 
certain  body  weight  that  can  be  treated  with  the  available  presentations  of  Libmyris,  i.e., patients 
weighing ≥ 30 kg.

device. The PFS and the PFP are packed in a PVC/PE blister, together with alcohol pads. 
The finished product is presented as a similar biological application to the reference medicinal product 
Humira. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Adalimumab (also referred to as AVT02) is a recombinant, fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1) kappa monoclonal antibody consisting of two identical heavy (H) chains of 451 amino acids 
paired with two identical light (L) chains of 214 amino acids. Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF, 
thereby inhibiting the binding of TNF with its receptor. 
The antibody bears one N-glycosylation site on each heavy chain within the constant region at 
asparagine (Asn) 301. The N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence, in the CH2 region is essentially 
fully occupied with asialo, core-fucosylated, complex-type biantennary N-linked glycans with zero and 
one terminal galactose residues, abbreviated as FA2 and FA2G1, respectively. C-terminal lysine is 
encoded by the H chain expression vector cDNA sequence, and is observed in the mature, secreted 
form of AVT02. The penultimate glycine residue is the predominant H chain C-terminus in AVT02. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
AVT02 active substance is manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) by 
Alvotech hf, Reykjavik, Iceland. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The AS manufacturing process is a straightforward monoclonal antibody production process that 
consists of 9 sequential upstream processing (USP) and 7 sequential downstream processing (DSP) 
steps. AVT02 is produced in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)-S cell line. The manufacturing process 
begins with thawing of a single WCB vial followed by serial cell culture expansion in shake flasks and 
bioreactors leading to production scale bioreactor. The material from the production bioreactor is 
harvested and clarified with depth filtration followed by inline bioburden reduction filtration prior to 
further processing. The purification process includes Protein A chromatography, Low pH viral 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021  
Page 16/122 
 
 
 
inactivation, Multimodal chromatography and bioburden reduction, nanofiltration, and UF/DF filtration 
prior to final formulation, dilution, fill and freeze steps. The AS is stored in the container closure 
system. There are no reprocessing steps in the DS manufacturing process. No design space is claimed. 
The manufacturing process, with in-process controls, has been outlined in flow diagrams and additional 
information and input process parameters have been provided for each step in sufficient detail. In 
general, the presented in-process controls and tests for AS manufacturing are appropriate.  
Control of materials 
The applicant is using a two-tiered cell bank system in overall accordance with ICH Q 5B and Q 5D 
guidelines.  Descriptions of the methods used to characterise the MCB, WCB and PPCB (Post-Production 
Cell Banks) have been provided. Any materials of animal origin comply with the Note for Guidance 
EMA/410/01 and a valid EDQM certificate was provided. Therefore, the risk of transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathy (TSE) contamination is considered minimal. Overall, appropriate safety precautions 
and controls concerning the absence of bacteria, mycoplasma, and viruses has been considered for all 
source material, including reagents, media, and cells. The cell banking system and its characterisation 
and testing were adequately presented. 
Process validation 
 The manufacturing process for AVT02 DS has been validated at the intended production site, on several 
consecutive commercial scale batches. The validation study covered both the USP and DSP covered. 
Impurity clearance was also evaluated as part of process performance qualification (PPQ) activities. 
For all PQ batches CQAs remained within pre-defined In-process and Release specifications. However, 
two batches showed higher than expected levels of aggregates and as a consequence a lower purity 
(SEC) although both parameters remained within the acceptance criteria. Critical Process Parameters 
(CPPs) were maintained within established acceptable ranges during the qualification runs. Overall, 
validation acceptance criteria were met, and no manufacturing deviations were generated which 
impacted the validation, even though a number of deviations were raised. Consistency data from 
several at scale batches was presented in the dossier. The USP and DSP in-process data, combined 
with the batch data indicate that the process is capable of operating within defined parameters to 
generate product of the required product quality. 
In addition, the applicant has provided information on potential extractables/leachable from the single-
use equipment used, and a risk assessment in line with EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014 has been 
performed. 
Resin ageing studies were performed in scale-down models for the two chromatography steps in AVT02 
DS manufacturing demonstrating overall robust performance and resin stability. Information on the 
scale down models used in resin ageing studies was provided. 
Manufacturing process development 
Three different processes (0.1, 1.0 and 1.1) have been described and used during the different 
development phases of AVT02 active substance. The modifications introduced to the manufacturing 
processes during the development have been adequately described and sufficient details and rationale 
for each step has been provided. 
A high-level summary of USP and DSP manufacturing process characterisation was provided in the 
dossier. USP and DSP unit operations were risk assessed by Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA). 
Based on the risk assessment, the potential critical process parameters (pCPPs) were identified. These 
pCPPs were assessed during the process characterisation and subsequently classified as CPP or non-
Critical Process Parameters (nCPP). For parameters that are established as critical, a Proven 
Acceptable Range (PAR) was established based either on the parameters characterised, or limitations 
based on impact on CQAs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021  
Page 17/122 
 
 
 
Several significant changes were implemented between active substance (AS) manufacturing process 
0.1 and manufacturing process 1.0. Therefore, process 0.1 material used only in very early 
development is not considered fully representative of process 1.0 or 1.1 material; this is acceptable. 
Adjustments were made to the DSP process for process optimisation and closer alignment to the 
reference product between manufacturing process 1.0 and the intended commercial manufacturing 
process 1.1. No major process adjustments were made to the USP process. A comparability study was 
performed on AS as well as the respective finished product (FP) level for relevant pre- and post-change 
batches. Product quality was compared in terms of release data (AS and FP), in-process data (AS), 
additional characterisation (AS/FP), stability (AS and FP) and forced degradation (FP) behaviour. In-
process DS data showed comparable clearance rates for pre- and post- change batches in terms of 
product related variants (high molecular weight species, fragments and acidic species) and process-
related impurities (residual host cell protein (rHCP), leached recombinant protein A (rProtA) and host 
cell DNA (hcDNA)). Comparable primary and higher order structure were confirmed, including disulfide 
linkages and comparable free thiol levels. Deamidation and oxidation analysis showed comparable 
levels in pre- and post- change batches. Comparable efficacy of pre- and post- change batches was 
supported by comparable potency by cell viability assay, comparable binding to sTNFα and FcγRIIIa 
F158, as well as comparable ADCC and CDC activity and C1q binding. Additionally, binding to FcRn was 
comparable for pre- and post- change batches.  
DS and DP stability data showed comparable degradation pathways and trends for pre- and post- 
change batches.  
Based on the provided results, it is overall agreed that process 1.0 batches can be considered 
representative of process 1.1. 
Characterisation 
The characterisation studies were presented as a tabulated list in CTD section S.3.1 as the studies are 
also a part of analytical biosimilarity assessment described in CTD section 3.2.R. AVT02 has been 
characterised using state-of-the-art methodology. Data for primary, secondary and higher-order 
structure, post-translational forms (e.g., glycoforms), biological and functional activity, purity, and 
immunochemical properties have been generated and assessed. The detailed data, analysis and 
conclusions are presented in CTD Section 3.2.R.3. 
Impurities 
The applicant has summarised and discussed all product-related impurity variants with regards to their 
impact on AVT02 biological activity, safety, and efficacy. As the main product-related impurities, Size 
Variants (HMW Species and Fragments) and Charge Variants have been considered. Post-Translational 
Modifications (e.g., glycosylation and oxidation variants, deamidation, and N/C-terminal variants) are 
considered as product-related substances absent or present in very low amounts or shown to have no 
impact on efficacy and safety.  
As process-related impurities, Residual host cell protein, Residual host cell DNA, Residual Protein A, 
poloxamer 188 (pluronic F68), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and simethicone have been considered. 
Overall, no safety risks were identified. Descriptions and qualification of the analytical methods used to 
study poloxamer 188 (pluronic F68), and simethicone in AVT02 DS are provided. 
Container closure 
An appropriate description of the container closure system has been provided and compliance with 
relevant requirements has been confirmed. Satisfactory information regarding leachable and 
extractables has been provided. The compatibility of the AVT02 DS with the container has been 
evaluated  
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021

Overall, the Container Closure system used for AVT02 is acceptable. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The AS release and shelf-life specifications include tests for general attributes (clarity, colour, and pH), 
an identity test (peptide mapping), a test for protein content (OD280), a potency cell-based 
luminescence assay (in vitro TNFα neutralisation assay), purity tests (CEX for charge heterogeneity, 
CE-SDS (reducing and non-reducing) and SEC-HPLC for charge variants), test for N-glycosylation, tests 
for process related impurities (HCP ELISA, Host cell DNA qPCR, and Residual Protein A), and safety 
tests (Bacterial endotoxins and Bioburden). 
The test parameters proposed to be included in the AVT02 AS specification have been discussed 
separately and a very brief justification and historical data has been provided for each parameter. 
Overall, the test parameters included in the specification are considered relevant and in line with 
current guidance. Since ADCC is considered as a likely mechanism of action for adalimumab in certain 
indications, in order to ensure that AVT02 will maintain an ADCC activity similar to EU Humira, AS 
release testing for glycosylation will be performed using two methods with respective limits until 
further experience is gained. The CHMP requested and the applicant committed to revisit the 
acceptance limits for glycan structures once a certain number of batches of AS has been manufactured 
(REC).  
According to the applicant the specification acceptance criteria were initially established by literature 
review, pharmacopoeia monographs, and the specified quality target product profile (QTPP), as well as 
evaluating analytical results from development batches. The acceptance criteria have been further 
adjusted based on available development data and data from full-scale batches. Stability data has 
been reviewed and the specifications set to establish the targeted quality throughout the DS and DP 
shelf life. 
Analytical procedures 
AVT02 is tested using a combination of compendial and non-compendial analytical tests. Compendial 
analytical methods used for AVT02 batch release testing and stability are clarity, colour, pH, endotoxin 
(LAL test), and bioburden (membrane filtration). The methods are conducted as described by the 
relevant sections in the Ph. Eur. and have been verified under actual conditions of use (measuring a 
standard or reference) and then product verified by measuring a product to verify that the method is 
fit for purpose. 
Non-compendial analytical methods used for AVT02 batch release and stability studies include CE-SDS, 
CEX-HPLC,  HCP  ELISA,  Host  Cell  DNA,  OD280,  Peptide  Mapping,  Potency,  Glycosylation  (N-glycans), 
Residual  Protein  A,  and  SEC-HPLC.  Method  descriptions  and  other  relevant  information  have  been 
provided for the non-compendial methods. The applicant has also described how consistent performance 
of the analytical methods is ensured after method changes. 
The  non-compendial  analytical  methods  have  been  validated  according  to  ICH  Q2  (R1)  at  Alvotech, 
Reykjavik and full validation reports and a validation summary have been provided for all methods with 
the exception with the exception of one. The CHMP requested and the applicant committed to validate 
that method at the release site (REC). 
Reference standards 
The  strategies  for  establishing  the  reference  material  during  the  active  substance  development  have 
been  provided.  The  reference  material  used  throughout  the  product  development  and  the  bridging 
between two reference material have been adequately described. A two tiered reference material system 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021  
Page 19/122 
 
 
 
consisting of a primary reference material and a working reference material has been implemented; this 
is acceptable. 
Batch analysis 
Batch data for several AVT02 AS batches have been presented. The results obtained from all the batches 
are  within  the  proposed  commercial  specification.  Batch  data  was  also  presented  for  the  early 
development process batch. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
A shelf-life claim of 24 months when stored at -70±10°C in the commercial container is proposed for 
the AS. 
Stability data at the long-term storage condition (-70 ±10°C), at the accelerated storage condition 
(5±3°C) and stressed storage condition 25±2°C /60±5% RH was presented. The presented stability 
data has been generated using material from manufacturing processes 1.0 and 1.1, considered 
representative of commercial product. The stability samples have been stored in reduced size bags 
with the same interior product contact layer as the actual AS container. However, the fill volume has 
varied (60-97%). The 60% fill volume represents a worst-case fill with greatest headspace. The 
studies at long-term conditions are planned to continue up to 24 months for most batches. For PPQ 
batches the stability studies are planned to be continued until the 60-month time point has been 
reached. 
Real-time, accelerated and stressed storage condition stability data has been provided on several 
batches from process versions 1.0 and 1.1. 
No trends were observed in the tested parameters in the long-term conditions. However, in the 
provided data a possible slight decrease in potency by in vitro TNF neutralisation assay can be seen for 
some batches, even though the data remains within specification. The data from stressed stability 
studies show that the non-reduced CE SDS, CEX-HPLC and SEC-HPLC assays for testing purity are 
stability indicating. 
Overall, the stability of AVT02 AS has been adequately addressed according to ICH Q5C tripartite 
guideline. The proposed shelf-life of 24 months when stored at −70±10°C is supported by the provided 
data. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The FP (AVT02-DP) is a clear, colourless, sterile, preservative-free solution for subcutaneous injection 
containing  40  mg  (AVT02-DP40)  or  80  mg  (AVT02-DP80)  of  adalimumab  in  0.4  mL  or  0.8  mL  at  a 
concentration of 100 mg/mL. 
The FP is first filled into a pre-filled syringe (PFS),  which includes syringe with a stopper, needle and 
needle cap. The PFS can further be assembled either to: 
•  40 mg and 80 mg: Safety Device (SD) which consists of AVT02-DP PFS, fitted with a plunger 
rod, finger flanges and a needle safety device. 
•  40 mg only: Autoinjector (AI) which consists of AVT02-DP PFS, together with two housing covers, 
and a cap remover sleeve that encloses the AVT02-DP PFS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021  
Page 20/122 
 
 
 
 
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2..1 of this report. 
Formulation development 
The FP formulation was developed to generate a biosimilar to the reference product for subcutaneous 
administration capable of maintaining stability of quality attributes for the duration of the anticipated 
shelf life. The formulation was defined during early development (prior to shelf life determining studies 
and clinical studies) and has remained unchanged. All excipients in the formulation are of compendial 
quality and have not been changed during development, except for minor improvement in the quality 
standard of polysorbate 80. The choice of excipients has been justified. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process development has mainly focused on the changes between the processes 
1.0 and 1.1, and a tabulated summary of the changes between the two processes has been provided. 
Changes concern controlled-rate thawing of the AS, bioburden reduction filtration and sterile filtration 
as well as minor changes related to the devices used in filling and stoppering. Overall, no significant 
changes have been made to the manufacturing process throughout the product history. For the 
comparability confirmation (batches 1.0 and 1.1), comparative batch analysis data and stability data 
have been provided. According to the provided batch analysis and stability study results, the batches 
are comparable. It is unlikely that these presented changes affect the product quality. 
The microbial safety of the FP is controlled by in-process bioburden and endotoxin tests within the release 
and during shelf-life. 
Container closure system 
The primary packaging components are glass syringe barrel and plunger stopper. The material of the 
glass syringe barrel is according to Ph. Eur. requirement hydrolytic glass type I (Ph.Eur 3.2.1) and the 
plunger stopper with Ph. Eur. requirement for rubber closures (Ph. Eur. 3.2.9). With regards to safety 
of the device components, including e.g., silicone, heavy metals, extractables and leachables, 
compliance of the PFS and PFP with the relevant Essential Requirements in Annex I of Directive 
93/42/EEC was reviewed. Issues identified were satisfactorily addressed. Based on the presented 
information and assessment of the additional responses concerning safety of the device components, 
no further concerns remain. Sterilisation of the glass syringes is performed using Ethylene oxide (EtO). 
Ethylene oxide sterilisation method used by the supplier is justified. Stoppers and syringes are 
reported to be received sterile. Site of sterilisation is informed. 
Specifications and method of analysis are listed for the device in section P.7.; release specification for 
both device types is provided and cover appearance, functional performance, and mechanism of action. 
Compatibility of the FP with syringe container closure systems has been established through stability 
studies. With regards to functional stability of both devices, the applicant has provided data and 
justification to support the functionality of the AI and the SD over the whole shelf-life. A summary of 
the shipping validation studies has been provided.  
The safety and effectiveness of the auto-injector has been assessed in Human Factor studies which have 
been assessed in detail in the clinical assessment report. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturers 
The FP PFS is manufactured and released at Alvotech Hf Iceland. The site responsible for batch release 
of PFS and AI in the EU is Ivers-Lee CSM Germany. 
Manufacturing process 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021  
Page 21/122 
 
 
 
The AVT02-DP PFS is manufactured by thawing, pooling and mixing of the formulated AVT02 AS, 
followed by filtration and aseptic filling into syringes. The AVT02-DP PFS is composed of the AS filled 
into syringes, each with a needle, needle-cap and stopper. The PFS is further assembled to auto-
injector or safety device presentations. Necessary details concerning the manufacturing processes 
were provided.  
It is indicated that more than one batch of AVT02 AS may be pooled to generate a single AVT02-DP PFS 
batch based on supply demand. Batch definition has been amended to include the maximum number of 
AVT02 AS batches which can be pooled to generate an AVT02-DP PFS batch.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
For process characterisation studies, the manufacturing process steps including thawing of the AS, 
pooling and mixing, bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtration and filling/stoppering have been 
studied. Each manufacturing step has been assessed including parameters that may have a potential 
impact on the final product quality and process consistency. The ranges and criticality designation of 
each parameter based on the outcome of a characterisation risk assessment and characterisation 
studies were provided. The criticality assessment (i.e., the designation of parameters as CPPs/non-
CPPs, as well as the setpoint, manufacturing operating range (MOR), proven acceptable range (PAR) 
and characterisation range (CR) were summarised. The designation of the criticality of process 
parameters is adequately addressed. The proposed controls and acceptance criteria also cover relevant 
points to achieve consistent quality in the manufacturing process of auto-injector (AI) and safety 
device (SD). Hold times were assigned from aseptic hold times supported by media fill studies and 
from development studies wherein the impact of these hold times for physicochemical stability was 
determined. 
Manufacturing process validation 
The formal validation of the AVT02-DP PFS manufacturing process has been performed at Alvotech, at 
full commercial scale as part of PPQ and included media fill validation and filters integrity studies. 
Further investigations were triggered for two of the PPQ batches because of detected out of 
specification (OOS) results in Purity test. The cause of the observed OOS was satisfactorily explained. 
Two additional batches were included in the process validation based on revised PPQ protocol to meet 
the protocol acceptance criteria for the number of qualification batches. To address the root cause and 
prevent similar incidents going forward, the specification for monomer purity for AS and FP was 
adjusted. Based on the provided results, the FP manufacturing process of the pre-filled syringe can be 
considered successfully validated. A summary of the results for process validation studies concerning 
assembly of the auto-injector and safety device were also provided and is deemed satisfactory. Filter 
validation studies are considered successfully performed as well. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The release and shelf-life specifications for the 40 and 80 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
include tests and limits for general tests (clarity, colour, uniformity of dosage units, visible particles, 
pH, osmolality), tests for identity (peptide mapping), tests for quantity (protein concentration A280, 
extractable volume), tests for biological activity (in vitro TNF-α neutralisation assay), purity and 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021

impurity tests (non-reducing/reducing CE-SDS, SE-HPLC, CEX-HPLC), Polysorbate 80 (RP-UPLC-ELSD) 
as well as tests for safety (sterility, endotoxin, particulate matter).  
The test items are identical for AS and FP, except for sterility, uniformity of dosage units, visible 
particles, extractable volume, osmolality and Polysorbate 80, which are only included in the FP 
specifications. 
The proposed FP release and end of shelf-life specification acceptance criteria are considered 
acceptable. Release specifications for auto-injector (AI) and release and shelf-life specifications for the 
safety device (SD) were also provided. The specifications for auto-injector and for the safety device 
were presented and are acceptable.  
Characterisation of impurities 
No additional impurities are detected in the FP compared to the active substance. For discussion on 
impurities please refer to the Characterisation section. The potential presence of elemental impurities 
in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline 
for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3 batches using a validated method was provided, 
demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective 
PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not 
necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the FP specification. The information on the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Also, in response to a Major Objection raised by the CHMP a risk evaluation concerning the presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been performed (as requested) considering all 
suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk 
was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related 
finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary.  
Analytical methods and method validation 
The analytical methods used for the control of FP are largely the same as those used for AS. Analytical 
methods for Sterility and Polysorbate 80 are specific for the FP and have been validated to be used 
with the FP. The same reference standards are used for control of the AS and FP.  
Batch data 
Batch analysis data derived from several lots of AVT02 finished product manufactured throughout 
development were presented. These batches were used for non-clinical, clinical, and stability as well as 
analytical similarity studies. All batches except for two (as discussed previously) met the acceptance 
criteria in place at the time of release.   
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 24 months at 5±3°C plus 2 weeks at room temperature (25°C) storage protected from 
light was claimed for the finished product. 
Stability study results at long term conditions (5±3°C) for 3 batches up to 24 months, for 2 batches 
(commercial scale) up to 12 months, for 1 batch (commercial scale) up to 6 months and for 2 batches 
(commercial scale) up to 1 month, were provided. Stability specifications were met showing no 
significant trend in any tested parameter. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021

Stability study results at accelerated conditions (25±2°C) for 6 batches up to 6 months, for 2 batches 
up to 1 month and for 1 batch for 14 days, are provided. The results for peptide mapping, protein 
concentration, appearance (colour & clarity), pH, osmolality, endotoxin, sterility and polysorbate 80, 
were within specification limits. However, elevated temperature increases the amount HMW and acidic 
variants. 
Stability study results at stressed conditions (40±2°C) for 7 batches up to 3 months and for 2 batches 
up to 1 month, are provided. The results for peptide mapping, protein concentration, appearance 
(colour & clarity), pH, osmolality, endotoxin, sterility and polysorbate 80, were within specification 
limits. However, the amount of HMW and acidic variants were increased but remained within 
specification. 
As outlined in ICH Q5C tripartite guideline, primary data to support a requested storage period should 
be based on long-term, real-time, real-condition stability studies for at least three batches for which 
manufacture, and storage are representative of the manufacturing scale of production. The shelf-life 
assignment of AVT02-AI will be based on the long-term stability data available on the PFS. The 
assembly of PFS with the safety device (SD) or the autoinjector components is not anticipated to have 
a measurable impact on chemical and functional stability, and therefore the stability data taken from 
PFS is considered the primary product shelf-life assignment data. With regards to functional stability of 
both devices, satisfactory data, and justification to support the functionality of the AI and the SD over 
the whole shelf-life were provided.  
Stability study results for the additional storage of 2 weeks at 25°C / 60% are provided for 3 batches. 
There is no significant upward or downward trend in any stability parameter, or any OOS results. 
Overall, the provided data support the claim of short-term temperature excursion outside the label 
storage conditions for 2 weeks.  
Photostability studies were performed in accordance with ICH Q1B. Out of specification (OOS) results 
were detected in potency, charge heterogeneity (SEC-HPLC, %monomer), size variants (CE-SDS non-
reducing, %monomer) and in heavy chain amounts (CE-SDS reducing, %monomer) when exposed to 
light. Thus, the product should be protected from light. Based on the results off the photostability 
study the cardboard secondary packaging is considered sufficient protection from light. 
Container closure integrity test is conducted in accordance with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 Self-sealing test and test 
results remained within the specification limits at all time-points.  
Based on the overall data the proposed shelf-life of 24 months at long term conditions (5°C ± 3°C) for 
all presentations of the finished product is acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Biosimilarity 
On the quality level, a comprehensive biosimilarity exercise has been performed following the general 
principles  outlined  in  the  guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-
derived proteins as active substance; Quality issues (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012). 
Comparative analysis has been performed using the AVT02 DP in a pre-filled syringe (AVT02-DP PFS) 
presentation with a 0.4 or 0.8 mL fill. A sufficient number of AVT02 DP lots, manufactured from 
independent AS batches, and of EU-Humira batches were included for comparability studies. US-
Humira batches were also included in those studies. The clinical batch clinical AVT02 DP has been used 
in the comparability studies.  AVT02 batches from an earlier process and the final process were 
included, trisulfide modification from the earlier process was remove in the final process. 
Comparability between AS manufacturing processes have been demonstrated. 
Assessment report

During the course of development of AVT02, multiple independent comparative analytical head-to-head 
(H2H) studies have been performed. From the provided testing plan it is understood that H2H 
assessment have been performed for all of the physicochemical and analytical methods. The applicant 
proposes to use a standard deviation (SD) approach as comparability ranges. The SD multipliers were 
chosen based on criticality ranking. Most of the comparability ranges were set at ±3SD; these were for 
CQAs ranked as high, moderate and low criticality. Tighter range (±2.5SD) was set for the CQAs with a 
highest risk. Comparability ranges are considered supportive of the overall similarity assessment. In 
addition, in most cases sufficient raw data has been provided to allow assessment of biosimilarity 
independently of statistical approach chosen. A summary table including critical evaluation of 
biosimilarity is presented in Table 1.

The amino acid sequence of AVT02 was confirmed to be 
identical to the sequence of Humira.  
The molecular mass of adalimumab in AVT02 and EU-
Humira was confirmed to be highly similar. 
The amount of the C-terminal Lysine was larger for AVT02 
(28.9-32.2%) compared to EU-Humira (18.8-25.0%). 
Amidation of the terminal proline was higher in AVT02 (2.6- 
3.3%) compared to EU-Humira (0.2-0.4%). These 
differences are not expected to have clinical impact.  
Slightly, non-significantly, lower levels of HT38 deamidation 
was observed for AVT02 (2.1-2.5%) when compared to EU-
Humira (2.6-2.8%). In addition, oxidation levels of HT21 
(Met256) and HTH42 (Met432) were higher in AVT02 (4.6-
6.4% and 2.2-2.8%, respectively) than in EU-Humira (3.4-
3.6% and 1.3-1.5%, respectively). The difference is 
considered clinically irrelevant. 
Difference in C-terminal Lysine and in Lysine glycation 
levels (slightly higher in AVT02 HC: 5.0-5.5 and LC: 1.8-2.3 
than in EU-Humira HC:2.3-3-2 and LC: 1.0-1.1) were 
detected. These slight differences are not expected to have 
clinical impact. 
Overall, similarity in terms of primary structure was 
demonstrated. 
Comparable secondary and tertiary structure is 
demonstrated.  
Highly similar molecular structure, no trisulfide linkages 
were detected in AVT02 (DS Process 1.1) and Humira. 
Similar, low levels of free thiols observed in AVT02 and 
Humira. 
Highly similar protein content and extinction coefficient. 
Amount of monomers measured via SEC-HPLC is high in 
both products (98.6-99.3% and 99.4-99.76% in AVT02 and 
EU-Humira, respectively). Slightly higher amounts of high 
molecular weight species (HMWs) are observed in AVT02 
(0.7-1.3%) when compared to EU-Humira (0.29-0.5%). 
Differences do not have clinical significance. 
AUC was used as an orthogonal method to compare the 
levels of size variants and the data showed comparable 
amounts of monomers, and higher order oligomers. 
Differences are not considered clinically significant. 
SEC-MALS demonstrated similarity in monomers and 
dimers, however, a peak correlating with higher order 
aggregates was detected only for AVT02. Enriched SEC 
fractions were further analysed and confirmed that both 
AVT02 and Humira HMW1 mainly contains Adalimumab 
higher order aggregates and HMW2 fractions mainly contain 
Adalimumab dimer. The impact on potency was also studied 
confirming that the TNFα potency, ADCC activity and 
FcγRIIIa binding was similar for AVT02 and Humira for the 
dimer and the HOA. The data demonstrated that AVT02 and

Humira HMWs (especially HMW1) had reduced potency and 
reduced effector functions. HMWs are controlled at DP 
release. These differences are not expected to have clinical 
impact. 
The level of intact IgG in non-reduced CE-SDS was slightly 
lower in AVT02 97.0-98.2% with total fragments of 1.8-
3.0% compared to EU-Humira (97.8-98.8% and 1.0-2.7%, 
respectively). These very slight difference are not 
considered clinically significant. 
In the reduced CE-SDS HC+LC level in AVT02 (97.3%-
98.4%) was slightly lower when compared to EU-Humira 
(98.2-99%), and the level of deglycosylated heavy chain 
(DHC) was slightly higher in AVT02 (1.7-1.9%) than in EU-
Humira (1.0-1.3%). This minor max. 0.6% difference is 
not, however, expected to have clinical impact. 
Slightly higher amount of galactosylated glycans is 
observed in AVT02, however the galactosylation levels are 
mostly overlapping and therefore AVT02 and EU-Humira 
can be considered similar in terms of galactosylation. 
The level of high mannose species was lower in AVT02 (3.4-
4.2%) in comparison to EU-Humira (8.4-9.6%), whereas 
the level of afucosylated species (high mannoses not 
included) was slightly higher in AVT02 (2.3-2.7%) than in 
EU-Humira (1.2-1.5%). Consequently, the total level of 
afucosylated glycans was 6.0-6.7% in AVT02 in comparison 
to EU-Humira 10.4-11.7%.  
AVT02 was confirmed to contain higher amount of acidic 
species (16-20%) than EU-Humira (13-17%). Higher levels 
of basic variants was observed in AVT02 (29-33%) than in 
EU-Humira batches (17-25%). Consequently, the amount of 
main species were 50-53% and 60-67% for AVT02 and EU-
Humira, respectively. cIEF was used as an orthogonal 
method and similar data than with CEX-HPLC was observed. 
Predominant basic species corresponds to differences in C-
terminal lysine. Other basic variants are caused by slightly 
higher levels of amidated proline variants as in AVT02. N-
glycan analysis of fractions demonstrated that more 
galactosylated and sialyted glycans were present in AVT02 
acidic fractions.  
Based on the characterisation results presented, it can be, 
however concluded that the differences observed in charge 
variant profiles are not expected to have clinical impact. 
Highly similar levels of sub-visible particles for AVT02 and 
EU-Humira. 
Similar binding to sTNFα and mTNFα was demonstrated. 
AVT02 neutralizes sTNFα in similar matter than EU-Humira, 
and subsequently inhibits TNFα induced cell death. In 
addition, apoptosis inhibition in intestinal epithelial cells 
(HCT11) was comparable. AVT02 and EU-Humira showed 
similar inhibition of IL-8 and IL-6 secretion in dose-
dependent matter. Inhibition of adhesion E-Selectin, ICAM-
1 and VCAM-1 expression by AVT02 and EU-Humira were

comparable. Furthermore, AVT02 and EU-Humira blocked 
reverse signaling of TNFα in a similar way. 
Similarity was demonstrated with FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, and 
FcγRIIb.  
Lower binding to FcγRIIIb was observed for AVT02 (82-
108%) than for EU-Humira (102-117.9%). Also, as 
FcγRIIIb lacks robust signaling and it is found mainly in 
neutrophils and a sub-population of basophil, the 
importance of this difference with regards to MoA is not 
considered relevant. 
Classical ADCC assay was performed by primary PBMCs 
with low affinity F/F genotype. Even though ADCC activity 
of AVT02 batches (86-110%) fell within the comparability 
range 77-141%, a slight trend of lower ADCC activity was 
observed for AVT02 when compared to EU-Humira (91-
122%). This trend was not, however observed in the cell-
based ADCC reporter gene assay. Slightly lower trend of 
binding to FcγRIIIa (F158) supporting the lower ADCC 
activity could be seen for AVT02, however this was not 
detected with the high affinity V158 genotype. 
Based on the lower level of total afucosylated glycans 
present in AVT02 as compared to EU-Humira, a lower ADCC 
activity would be expected.  No clear difference in relevant 
Fc receptor binding assays and only to a minor difference in 
the ADCC assay using PBMCs as effector cells. No 
differences were seen in the ADCC RGA. It is therefore 
considered unlikely that the difference seen in the ADCC 
PBMC assays would be clinically significant. However, to 
ensure to remain the similar with regards to ADCC activity, 
stringent control for total afucosylated glycans is set. 
Similar CDC activity and FcRn and C1q binding between 
AVT02 and EU-Humira is demonstrated. 
AVT02 showed similarity in their function to induce an 
increase in M2 macrophage differentiation and inhibiting T-
cell proliferation. 
Similarity in degradation studies was demonstrated.

Physicochemical properties 
Primary structure 
Primary structure has been studied with regards to amino acid sequence, peptide map (Lys-C/trypsin), 
molecular masses, disulphide bonds, and sulfhydryl analysis. The amino acid sequence of AVT02 was 
confirmed to be identical to the sequence of Humira. A sequence coverage of 100% of the HC and LC 
was achieved by LC-MS/MS peptide mapping using various types of proteases. 
The molecular mass of adalimumab in AVT02 and EU-Humira was determined by high resolution LC 
ESI-TOF-MS, and confirmed to be highly similar with the theoretical values for the intact, reduced and 
de-N-glycosylated antibodies. Difference in C-terminal Lysine and in Lysine glycation levels (see table 
above) were detected. These slight differences are not expected to have clinical impact as these lysine 
residues were not located at complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) and therefore lack impact 
on Fc functions. Differences related to C-terminal lysine was observed also in peptide mapping profile. 
Deamidations and oxidations were studied via LC-MS. Comparable levels of asparagine and glutamine 
deamidations were demonstrated for AVT02 and EU-Humira. It is however, noted that slightly, non-
significantly, lower levels of HT38 deamidation was observed in AVT02 when compared to EU-Humira 
(see table above). In addition, oxidation levels of HT21 (Met256) and HTH42 (Met432) were higher in 
AVT02 than in EU-Humira (see table above). The difference is considered clinically irrelevant as no 
difference could be seen in overall FcRn binding or CDC activity for AVT02 and EU-Humira. Similar 
trend was observed also as part of thermal degradation studies (stressed conditions) via LC-MS, where 
calculated Met256 oxidation increase rate was slightly higher for AVT02 (+5.2) than for EU-Humira 
(+1.5). It seems that sAVT02’s Met256 oxidates slightly more easily than EU-Humira’s. However, as 
the thermal degradation studies did not indicate any difference in FcRn binding or CDC activity, the 
difference in Met256 due to extreme thermal stress is not considered significant from clinical point of 
view. 
The analysis of the N- and C-terminal integrities of the light and heavy chains of AVT02 and Humira 
were evaluated by LC-MS analysis. The amount of the C-terminal Lysine was larger for AVT02 
compared to EU-Humira (see table above). Such difference in C-terminal Lys is not considered clinically 
relevant. Furthermore, there are small differences in the levels of N-terminal pyroglutamic acid and C-
terminal proline amidation. Amidation of the terminal proline was higher in AVT02 compared to EU-
Humira (see table above). Considering the location of the proline in C-terminus of the heavy chain and 
having a similar charge profile to C-terminal Lysine, the difference in proline amidation is not expected 
to have clinical impact. 
Higher order structure 
Similar secondary and tertiary structure of AVT02 and EU-Humira was assessed by far- and near-UV 
circular dichroism (CD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC), and intrinsic fluorescence. In intrinsic fluorescence studies, the fluorescence 
intensities varied slightly between AVT02 samples, however the maximal fluorescence intensity 
wavelength was similar for all batches of EU-Humira and AVT02. Additionally, the fluorescence curves 
were comparable between AVT02 and EU-Humira. Therefore, it can be concluded that the folding of the 
AVT02 and EU-Humira are similar.  
Trisulfide peptides were estimated at 11.0% - 13.6% and 0.5% - 1.7% in the tested AVT02 batches 
produced by the earlier DS process 1.0. Trisulfides were however removed by a process change at the 
AS level (AVT02 DS process 1.1), and no trisulfide modifications were detected after that. Trisulfide 
modification was not detected in the Humira samples. This was also confirmed by the peptide mapping 
profile. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 29/122 
 
 
 
 
Overall, amount of free thiols is low in both AVT02 and EU-Humira. Quality range of 0.35-0.44 was set, 
and three batches of AVT02 were just over the quality range with values of 0.45, 0.47, and 0.46. The 
applicant’s conclusion can be agreed upon, and this minor difference in free thiol content is not 
expected to be clinically meaningful. 
In conclusion, no significant differences could be seen between AVT02 and Humira in any of the assays, 
therefore similarity with regard to higher order structures can be concluded. 
Size heterogeneity 
Amount of monomers measured via SEC-HPLC is high in both products (see table above). Slightly 
higher amounts of high molecular weight species (HMWs) are observed in AVT02 when compared to 
EU-Humira (see table above). In general, the HMW amounts can be considered low for both products. 
Additionally, AUC was used as an orthogonal method to compare the levels of size variants and the 
data showed comparable amounts of monomers, dimers and higher order oligomers. HMWs were 
further characterised with SEC-MALS demonstrating similarity in monomers and dimers, however, a 
peak correlating with higher order aggregates was detected only for AVT02. The applicant further 
characterised the SEC variant fractions via CE-SDS, LC-MS, and SEC-MALS utilizing heat stress 
samples where the HOA where enriched in both AVT02 and EU-Humira. It was and confirmed that both 
AVT02 and Humira HMW1 mainly contains Adalimumab higher order aggregates and HMW2 fractions 
mainly contain Adalimumab dimer. The impact on potency was also studied confirming that the TNFα 
potency, ADCC activity and FcγRIIIa binding was similar for AVT02 and Humira for the dimer and the 
HOA. The data demonstrated that AVT02 and Humira HMWs (especially HMW1) had reduced potency 
and reduced effector functions. HMWs are controlled at FP release. These differences are not expected 
to have clinical impact. 
Size heterogeneity was evaluated also via CE-SDS under both reduced and un-reduced conditions. The 
level of intact IgG in non-reduced CE-SDS was slightly lower in AVT02 compared to EU-Humira (see 
table above). According to the applicant, the fragments were mainly due to Heavy-Heavy-Light 
Complexes (HHL), which were produced more by previous AS manufacturing process 1.0. In the newer 
AVT02 batches produced by the AS 1.1 process, the level of HHL complexes is clearly lower and in 
comparable levels to Humira. Nonetheless, these differences, are considered minor and do not imply 
clinical significance. 
In the reduced CE-SDS HC+LC level in AVT02 was slightly lower when compared to EU-Humira (see 
table above), and the level of deglycosylated heavy chain (DHC) was slightly higher in AVT02 than in 
EU-Humira (see table above). This minor max. 0.6% difference is not, however expected to have 
clinical impact. 
Glycan profile 
N-glycan composition was compared by labelling the N-glycans with 2-AB and analyzing by normal-
phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. Slightly higher amount of galactosylated glycans is observed 
in AVT02, however the galactosylation levels are mostly overlapping and therefore AVT02 and EU-
Humira can be considered similar in terms of galactosylation. 
The amount of sialyated glycans was greater in AVT02 in comparison to EU-Humira (see table above). 
Very low and similar levels of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc were detected in AVT02 (<0.05% and 0.002%, 
respectively) compared to EU-Humira (<0.01% and <0.001%, respectively). It is justified by the 
applicant, that as no difference in Fc receptor function nor in clinical studies are observed, the 
difference in sialyated glycans is not considered great importance. 
The main differences between AVT02 and EU-Humira were observed in the levels mannosylated and 
afucosylated glycans. The level of high mannose species (M5, M6, M7, M8, and M9) was lower in 
AVT02 (3.4-4.2%) in comparison to EU-Humira (8.4-9.6%), whereas the level of afucosylated species 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 30/122 
 
 
 
 
(high mannoses not included) was slightly higher in AVT02 (2.3-2.7%) than in EU-Humira (1.2-1.5%). 
Consequently, the total level of afucosylated glycans was 6.0-6.7% in AVT02 in comparison to EU 
Humira 10.4-11.7%. According to the applicant, as no significant differences were noted in the overall 
ADCC activity and binding to FcγRIIIa or FcRn nor in the pharmacokinetic activities in the PK clinical 
trial, these differences are not expected to have clinical impact. The applicant has performed in 
addition effector glycan sensitivity studies for the FcγRIIIa F158 SPR, ADCC RGA and ADCC classical 
cell based PBMC (F/F). In summary, although a difference could be detected in the glycan profiles of 
AVT02 and EU Humira, this did not result in clear differences in relevant Fc receptor binding assays 
and only to a minor difference in the ADCC assay using PBMCs as effector cells. No differences were 
seen in the ADCC RGA assay. It is therefore considered unlikely that the difference seen in the ADCC 
PBMC assays would be clinically significant. However, as ADCC is considered as a likely mechanism of 
action for adalimumab in certain indications and a clear correlation between the level of total 
afucosylated glycans and high mannoses and ADCC activity can be observed, additional stringent 
specification have been set for total afucosylation to ensure the similarity of AVT02 to the reference 
medicinal product. 
Charge variants 
Distribution of charge variants was different for AVT02 than for EU-Humira. Charge variants were 
studied via CEX-HPLC and cIEF. CEX-HPLC was performed under two conditions: either with or without 
treatment of carboxypeptidase B (CPB) to remove C-terminal lysine residues. Without CPB treatment 
AVT02 was confirmed to contain higher amount of acidic species than EU-Humira (see table above). 
Higher levels of basic variants were observed in AVT02 than in EU-Humira batches (see table above). 
Consequently, the amount of main species were 50-53% and 60-67% for AVT02 and EU-Humira, 
respectively. After CPB digest the amount of basic variants was reduced, however still resulting slightly 
higher amounts when compared to EU-Humira. cIEF was used as an orthogonal method and similar 
data than with CEX-HPLC was observed. AVT02 contains slightly higher amount of acidic variants (21-
29%) when compared to EU-Humira (20-23%). More basic variants were observed in AVT02 (30-32%) 
than in EU-Humira (21-24%) and less main variants in AVT02 (42-49%) than in EU-Humira (55-62%). 
Additional characterisation was performed on charge variant CEX-HEPLC regions isolated from AVT02 
(DP190002) and EU-Humira (93543XH05) batches. According to the applicant, the fractions were 
characterised using a combination of analytical techniques, including physicochemical assays to 
determine the structure, as well as potency and binding assays. As part of characterisation studies, a 
CPB treatment was performed to confirm that predominant basic species in AVT02 and EU Humira 
corresponds to differences in C-terminal lysine. Other basic variants are caused by amidated proline 
variants as slightly higher level of HL31-KG + proline amidation was observed via LC/MS analysis for 
AVT02 than in EU-Humira. Additionally, a peak fractionation study was conducted, including 
identification of the molecular variants present in each charge variant fraction. Based on the provided 
summary, it can be concluded that no new protein modifications were detected in AVT02 charge 
isoform assignments. Furthermore, N-glycan analysis of fractions demonstrated that more 
galactosylated and sialyted glycans were present in AVT02 acidic fractions, which could result the slight 
difference seen in acidic variants. 
The charge variant fractions of AVT02 and Humira were also assessed for sTNFα binding, FcγRIIIa 
(V158) binding, C1q binding, and relative potency. Lowest potency was detected for acidic fraction. 
Otherwise, no significant differences are observed overall biological activity with the exception binding 
activity of the fractions to FcγRIIIa (V158). These were 97-115% and 122-144% for AVT02 and 
Humira, respectively. The applicant suspects that this could be due to lower level of afucosylated 
glycans in AVT02, which can be agreed. The fraction characterisation studies demonstrate that the 
main peak fractions of AVT02 and EU-Humira has similar binding affinity to FcγRIIIa 158V, thus 
indicating that unfractionated DP is much less affected. Based on the characterisation results 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021

presented, it can be, however be concluded that the differences observed in charge variant profiles are 
not expected to have clinical impact. 
Comparative stability studies 
Forced degradation studies for AVT02 and EU-Humira was performed. The studies included low and 
high pH-, photolytic-, thermal-, oxidative-, and agitative degradation. The applicant has not performed 
comparative real-time real-condition stability studies for AVT02 and EU-Humira, which is, however not 
considered necessary for demonstration of biosimilarity. 
Particle analysis 
Subvisible particles analysis by MFI and DLS demonstrated highly similar levels of sub-visible particles 
for AVT02 and EU-Humira. 
Biological properties 
All biological characterisation results were briefly described and similarity expressed either by % of 
relative potency or % of relative binding. For receptor binding assays via SPR no Kd or Ka values have 
been provided, and only relative % values are included.  
Fc related 
Comparative ADCC assays (classical and a cell-based reporter assay), CDC assay, and binding of 
adalimumab to FcγRIIIa (F158 and V158), FcRn, FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIb and C1q were 
conducted. Similarity was demonstrated for FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, and FcγRIIb binding. Lower binding to 
FcγRIIIb was observed for AVT02 (82-108%) than for EU-Humira (102-117.9%), which can be also 
explained by the lower level of afucosylated glycans in AVT02. Also, as FcγRIIIb lacks robust signaling 
and it is found mainly in neutrophils and a sub-population of basophil, the importance of this difference 
with regards to MoA is not considered relevant. 
Classical ADCC assay was performed using primary PBMCs with low affinity F/F genotype. Even though 
ADCC activity of AVT02 batches (86-110%) fell within the comparability range 77-141%, a slight trend 
of lower ADCC activity was observed in AVT02 when compared to EU-Humira (91-122%). This trend 
was not, however observed in the cell-based ADCC reporter gene assay. SPR binding assay was 
employed to assess the binding affinity to FcyRIIIa (F158 and V158). Slightly lower trend of binding to 
FcγRIIIa (F158) supporting the lower ADCC activity could be seen for AVT02, however this was not 
detected with the high affinity V158 genotype. 
In addition to classical ADCC assay, a RGA assay was employed to analyse the binding of adalimumab 
to FcyRIIIa and downstream signalling events in cell based assay. A stable Jurkat cell line expressing 
FcRIIIa was used to study the early steps of ADCC pathway. No significant differences were observed 
between AVT02 and EU-Humira. Similar CDC activity and FcRn and C1q binding between AVT02 and 
EU-Humira is demonstrated. AVT02 showed similarity in their function to induce an increase in M2 
macrophage differentiation and inhibiting T-cell proliferation. 
Fab related 
Similar binding to sTNFα and mTNFα was demonstrated. AVT02 neutralizes sTNFα in similar matter as 
EU-Humira, and subsequently inhibits TNFα induced cell death. In addition, apoptosis inhibition in 
intestinal epithelial cells (HCT11) was comparable. AVT02 and EU-Humira showed similar inhibition of 
IL-8 and IL-6 secretion in dose-dependent matter. Inhibition of adhesion E-Selectin, ICAM-1 and 
VCAM-1 expression by AVT02 and EU-Humira were comparable. Furthermore, AVT02 and EU-Humira 
blocked reverse signaling of TNFα in a similar way. 
Other biological properties  
Induction of regulatory macrophages and subsequent T-cell anti-proliferation was investigate by studying 
inhibition  of  T  cell  proliferation  in  an  MLR  and  induction  of  regulatory  macrophages  type  II*.  AVT02

showed similarity in their function to induce an increase in M2 macrophage differentiation and inhibiting 
T-cell proliferation.  
Conclusion 
In conclusion, the similarity between AVT02 and the reference product, EU-Humira has been addressed 
in a comprehensive comparability exercise. It is acknowledged that Libmyris is highly similar to Humira 
(EU) in physicochemical and biological properties. No clinically meaningful differences are expected 
between Libmyris and the reference product, as further supported by the results of the functional 
characterisation and the clinical studies. 
Adventitious agents 
AVT02 is expressed in well-described Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, which are known to express 
retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs). The applicant determined the retroviral burden from cell culture 
supernatants. The calculated safety margin was considered sufficient. 
The applicant has performed viral testing of the unprocessed bulk harvest material and presented the 
methods used in viral testing.  
For viral clearance studies the applicant has chosen four model viruses, which was considered 
appropriate. These viruses included Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV), Pseudorabies (PRV), 
Reovirus 3 (Reo-3), and Minute virus of mice (MVM). The results of the viral clearance studies 
demonstrated that there are at least two orthogonal virus removal/inactivation steps which result in 
overall log reduction factors of over 10 for the tested model viruses. Both the mixed-mode 
chromatography and virus reduction filtration were effective in viral clearance. The applicant presented 
the inactivation results for low pH treatment for A-MuLV and PRV. The applicant has submitted virus 
validation reports to confirm that the viral clearance and inactivation studies performed result in a 
satisfactory outcome. 
The applicant has also performed viral clearance studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of both fresh 
and aged chromatography resin for virus removal. The study with the aged resin demonstrates that 
the virus removal/inactivation capacity of the resins used in the AVT02 process is not impacted with 
the aged resin. Overall, it is agreed that the viral clearance/inactivation studies performed are 
sufficient. 
The risk of microbial and mycoplasma contamination has, overall, been adequately addressed. The cell 
banks comply with the test for sterility and unprocessed bulk batches have been tested for bioburden 
and mycoplasma. Except for the cell banks, all raw materials and excipients used in the production 
process are of non-animal source. Consequently, no materials falling into the scope of the current Note 
for Guidance on minimizing the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents 
via medicinal products (EMA/410/01 rev 3) are used in the manufacturing processes for AVT02. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological documentation comply with existing guidelines. The manufacturing process of the active 
substance is adequately described, controlled, and validated. The results of tests carried out indicate 
satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the 
clinic. 
A major objection was raised during the procedure relating to the lack of a risk evaluation on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 33/122 
 
 
 
potential presence of nitrosamines impurities in the product. This major objection was satisfactorily 
resolved as the applicant provided the requested risk assessment and relevant documentation. 
The similarity between Libmyris and the reference product, Humira-EU has been addressed in a 
comprehensive comparability exercise. The provided quality data support biosimilarity versus the EU 
reference medicinal product (Humira (EU)) at the quality level.  In order to ensure that similarity 
remains at sufficient level with regards to ADCC activity, stringent controls for afucosylated glycan 
variants in AS release is applied. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- The applicant is recommended to revisit the acceptance limits for glycan structures once a certain 
number of batches of AS has been manufactured (REC). 
-The applicant is recommended to validate the method for glycan structures at the release site and 
provide the respective data by end of November 2021 (REC). 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Pharmacology 
A battery of in vitro assays evaluating the similarity in functional activity of AVT02 and EU-Humira 
included assessment of Fab-related sTNFα neutralisation activity (inhibition of sTNFα induced activation 
of caspase 3 and 7), inhibition of sTNFα-induced apoptosis, inhibition of TNFα-induced IL-8 release 
from HT1080 cells, and induction of reverse signaling in Jurkat-mTNFα cells. Fc-related analyses 
included binding to FC-receptors and to C1q, ADCC assays (classical and reporter) and a CDC assay. 
Additional assays included analysis of induction of PBMC differentiation to CD68/CD206+ regulatory 
macrophages and inhibition of CD4+ T-cell proliferation. These studies are sufficient to cover all 
relevant modes of action of adalimumab and are in line with the EMA guideline on similar biological 
medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). AVT02 batches representative of the proposed commercial process 
(manufacturing processes 1.0 and 1.1) were used in head-to-head comparison of the pharmacological 
in vitro analyses. 
All above mentioned in vitro comparability data were included under the M3.2.R.3, and no additional 
pharmacology data were presented under M4. To avoid repeating the provided data, functional 
comparability data are presented in the Quality Biosimilarity section. For the majority of the 
parameters analysed, similarity was demonstrated between AVT02 and EU-Humira. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 34/122 
 
 
 
No studies to evaluate secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology or pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions of AVT02 have been conducted in accordance with the EMA guidance for development of 
biosimilars. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
One non-GLP study AVT02-PC-001 in Cynomolgus monkeys was conducted to investigate local 
tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AVT02 and EU-Humira. A single dose of adalimumab (8 mg/kg) 
was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) to 6 animals per treatment group. Plasma samples were 
collected up to 14 days post administration for PK analysis. 
Two batches of AVT02 were included in the study, one from the early development process not 
representative of the drug product intended for marketing, and the other batch representative of the 
commercial product. This study was not designed to demonstrate the similarity in regards the PK or 
tolerability profiles and can be considered supportive only. 
Electrochemiluminescence assay was fit for purpose to quantify adalimumab (AVT02 or EU-Humira) of 
5 to 250 ng/mL in 5% cynomolgus monkey serum. 
AVT02 showed comparable Tmax, a slightly reduced exposure and longer terminal half-life compared 
to EU-Humira (mean values). Overall, the data did not reveal significant differences between the 
AVT02 and EU-Humira in their PK profiles in cynomolgus monkeys. 
No distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were conducted 
and are not required for a biosimilar. 
2.5.3.  Toxicology 
No specific toxicology studies were conducted with AVT02. The toxicology of adalimumab is well known 
from the reference product. No new process or product related impurities were identified that would 
affect safety of AVT02 or require further toxicity testing. 
The local tolerance investigations were included in the Cynomolgus monkey study investigating 
pharmacokinetics (AVT02-PC-001). The study was not designed to show similarity between AVT02 and 
EU-Humira. Nevertheless, the data indicated that there were no differences between AVT02 and 
Humira in injection site tolerability. Both adalimumabs triggered only mild reactions such as erythrema 
and edema in 1 out of 12 AVT02 group and 2 out of 6 in EU-Humira group cynomolgus monkeys. 
2.5.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance of AVT02 (adalimumab) is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody, not 
expected to result in a significant risk to the environment. Furthermore, in the case of biosimilars, an 
environmental risk assessment is not needed, which is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 
2). 
2.5.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A stepwise development and the totality of the evidence approach was applied in line with 
recommendations from EMA scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/859223/2018) and biosimilar guideline 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) to demonstrate the biosimilarity between ATV02 and Humira. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 35/122 
 
 
 
nonclinical dossier of AVT02 was very condensed. In vitro comparability data were included, and no 
additional pharmacology data were presented. In addition, nonclinical dossier included one supportive 
cynomolgus monkey study to assess pharmacokinetics and local tolerability. 
The comparative side-by-side functional in vitro data are from 9 AVT02 and 9 EU-Humira batches. For 
establishment of quality target profile, altogether 28 EU-Humira batches were used, of which 5 - 23 
batches were included in the cumulative comparative functional similarity assessments for calculating 
the % of relative potency or binding in comparison the reference standard. The functional analyses 
were done with AVT02 DP manufactured with processes 1.1 (commercial process) and 1.0. 
The ATV02 development programme was carried out using state-of-the-art and orthogonal methods. 
These studies are sufficient to cover all relevant modes of action of adalimumab and are in line with 
the EMA guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies – non-
clinical and clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). The presented data were condensed but 
allowed drawing broad conclusions of the similarity between AVT02 and EU-Humira for the majority of 
functional parameters (see further the Quality/Biosimilarity). Some differences were noted, but these 
are not anticipated to have clinical impact. Nevertheless, the differences noted in such as in the charge 
variants (in total afucosylation species) triggered a need for further clarifications, including the 
sensitivity of FcγRIIIa and classical ADCC assays to detect differences (described under the 
Quality/biosimilarity sections). These questions were included in the Quality LoQ. The nonclinical PK 
and local tolerability study in Cynomolgus monkeys were conducted with process 1.1. AVT02 batch, 
and with an early development batch not representative of the commercial product. This study was not 
designed to demonstrate the similarity in PK or tolerability and is considered supportive. The 
pharmacokinetic and local tolerance profiles of AVT02 (commercial process 1.1 batch) and EU-Humira 
did not differ significantly. 
2.5.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No Major Objections were identified from the nonclinical data of AVT02. Similarity of AVT02 and EU-
Humira in terms of functional, pharmacological activities was demonstrated adequately (refer to 
Quality/biosimilarity regarding the functional aspects rooting mainly to slight differences in the total 
afucosylation levels). 
The proposed SmPC section 5.3 is identical to that of EU-Humira. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The clinical studies were designed in accordance with the principles of International Council for 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013) in keeping with 
local legal requirements. Some uncertainties concerning study conduct and proper monitoring arose 
during assessment of study AVT02-GL-301 and study AVT02-GL-101. In particular, doubts arose 
related to adherence to study protocol vis-à-vis exclusion criteria in study AVT02-GL-301 and related 
to study drug administration in study AVT02-GL-101. Upon request, acceptable GCP Training 
Certificates of the principal investigators were provided. The applicant also provided sufficient 
assurance of adequate training of the study personnel and adherence to study protocol. The study

conduct, monitoring and training of the personnel of studies AVT02-GL- 101 and AVT02-GL- 303 
appear adequate. No further uncertainties regarding GCP compliance remain.

2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
Bioanalytical methods used in the clinical studies for Hukydra adalimumab include determination of 
adalimumab concentrations in human serum by using Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform based on 
electrochemiluminescent (ECL) signal detection and immunogenicity testing including detection of anti-
drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (Nab) also on ECL-MSD platforms. 
MSD-ECL based method was used in PK studies to quantify AVT02 and adalimumab (EU-Humira and 
US-Humira) concentrations in healthy human serum (clinical studies AVT02-GL-101 and AVT02-GL-
102) and in human serum samples from the patients with Plaque Psoriasis (PsO) (clinical study AVT02-
GL-301). In this method, MSD plates were coated with the Fab fragment of a commercial monoclonal 
ant-adalimumab antibody (BioRad) used as a capture antigen. After blocking and washing steps the 
standards, quality controls and samples were added to the plate. After incubation and washing Sulfo-
tagged detection antibody human anti-adalimumab was added and the ECL signal produced by Sulfo-
tag was detected. 
An ECL based method was utilised for the detection of ADAs against AVT02 and Humira in healthy and 
PsO human serum (clinical studies AVT02-GL-101, AVT02-GL-102 and AVT02-GL-301). A three-tiered 
approach comprising of screening, confirmation and titer was used. Both biotinylated and sulfo-tagged 
AVT02 preparations bind to anti-adalimumab antibodies. Resulting complexes were captured on 
streptavidin pre-coated ECL-specific microtiter plates and were detected via the emitted signal of the 
Sulfo-tag  Polyclonal goat anti-AVT02 antibody and polyclonal goat anti-Humira antibody were used as 
positive controls. 
An ECL assay for the detection of NAb against AVT02 and EU-Humira was performed using a 
competitive ligand binding assay format. In this method, biotinylated AVT02 was immobilised to 
streptavidin coated plates. The samples pre-treated with acid dissociation were added to plates. Sulfo-
Tag-labeled TNFα bound to AVT02 and Sulfo-tag produced a chemiluminescent signal that was 
triggered when voltage was applied. Presence of NAb prevents binding of TNFα and results in decrease 
in chemiluminescent signal. The resulting signal is, thus, inversely proportional to the amount of NAb 
present in sample. Anti-adalimumab monoclonal antibody against Humira was used as positive control. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Three clinical PK studies are included in the dossier to support the current application: 
•  Clinical study AVT02-GL-101: This PK similarity study compared the PK of AVT02, EU-Humira 
and US-Humira after single s.c. administration of 40 mg adalimumab in healthy subjects. 
•  Clinical study AVT02-GL-102: In this study, PK of AVT02 was compared between pre-filled 
syringe (PFS) and autoinjector (AI) in healthy subjects. 
•  Clinical study AVT02-GL-301: In this study, steady-state PK of AVT02 after multiple 
administrations in patients with moderate-to-severe PsO was assessed.

The  study  was  conducted  at  3  study  sites  in  New  Zealand  (2  sites:  101  Christchurch  Clinical  Studies 
Trust Limited, Christchurch, 201 Auckland Clinical Studies, Auckland) and Australia (1 site: 301 Scientia 
Clinical Research Limited, New South Wales) between 20 March 2019 (first subject enrolled) and 27 Feb 
2020 (last subject completed). The bioanalytical analyses at Nuvisan GmbH  were performed between 
31.10.2019 and 26.3.2020. 
This study was a phase I, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel, single-dose study in 
adult healthy subjects (13.3% Japanese). Enrollment was made in 2 parts. In part 1, at least 90 subjects 
(i.e.,  n  =  30/group)  were  enrolled  and  before  the  part  2,  an  interim  analysis  of  unblended  data  was 
made and the sample size for part 2 was calculated (to ensure power of at least 80%in the study). 
Subjects received a single 40 mg (0.4 ml) subcutaneous (s.c.) dose of either AVT02, EU-Humira, or US-
Humira in a pre-filled syringe (PFS) in a fasted state (water was allowed). Blood samples were collected 
for measurement of serum concentrations of adalimumab from all subjects at the following time points: 
pre-dose (within 1 hour of dosing), post-dose: 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 264, 336, 504, 
672, 840, 1008, 1176, 1344, and 1512 hours (= 63 days i.e., 9 weeks). Immunogenicity samples were 
collected at pre-dose (30 min before dosing) and at post-dose: 9, 15, 29 and 64 days. 392 subjects were 
randomised, and 390 subjects were dosed (n = 130 to AVT02, n = 129 to EU-Humira and n = 131 to 
US-Humira). 384 subjects completed the study. 
PK results 
380 subjects (96.9%) were included in the PK population: 128 in the AVT02 group, 125 in the EU 
Humira group, and 127 in the US-Humira group. 
Concentration-time profiles were similar following a single 40 mg s.c. dose of either AVT02, EU-Humira 
or US-Humira (Figure 1.

The geometric mean Cmax was similar across treatment groups for all 3 treatments (Table 3). The 
geometric mean AUC0-t and AUC0-inf were also comparable across the 3 treatment groups, with 
slightly higher geometric mean values observed for the AVT02 group compared with the EU-Humira 
group and US-Humira group for both parameters. Systemic elimination of adalimumab was consistent 
across the 3 treatment groups, with slow apparent total serum clearance and a long terminal half-life.

Table 3 Summary of serum PK parameters for adalimumab by treatment (PK population) 
In the comparison of all combined data from parts 1 and 2 for the AVT02 group with the EU-Humira 
and US-Humira treatment groups, the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means for the primary PK 
parameters of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf, based on the FC test analysis, were all contained within 
the pre-specified bioequivalence margins of 80% and 125%, thus demonstrating that systemic 
exposure after AVT02 administration is bioequivalent to exposure after both EU-Humira and US-Humira 
administration (Table 4). 
Table 4 Overview of bioequivalence assessment of adalimumab primary PK parameters (PK population) 
A sensitivity analysis of bioequivalence was performed on the combined final PK data using 
conventional methods (i.e., with no accounting for the 2 study parts). The results were supportive of 
the primary bioequivalence analysis. The 90% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios for the 3 primary 
PK parameters were all contained within 80% and 125%. In the qualitative comparison of adalimumab 
primary PK parameters in the Japanese subgroup, no notable differences were observed between the 
treatment groups, and the geometric mean ratios in all cases fell within the predefined equivalence 
range for the study as a whole.

Due  to  the  high  frequency  of  ADA  and  NAb  formation,  relationships  between  immunogenicity  and  PK 
parameters could not be elucidated. 
Clinical  device  study  to  compare  PK  of  AVT02  when  administered  from  PFS  and  from  AI 
(AVT02-GL-102) 
The  study  was  performed  at  2  study  sites  (i.e.,  Christchurch  Clinical  Studies  Trust  Ltd  and  Auckland 
Clinical Studies Ltd) in New Zealand, between 01 July 2019 (first subject enrolled) and 03 Dec 2019 (last 
subject completed). The PK bioanalytical analyses were performed by Nuvisan GmbH, Wegenerstrasse 
13,  Neu-Ulm,  Germany.  The  immunogenicity  bioanalytical  analyses  were  made  by  BioAgilytix  Europe 
GmbH, Hamburg, Germany. 
This study was a phase I, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, 2-arm, parallel study in adult healthy 
subjects. The final protocol was dated 29 March 2019. Subjects received a single s.c. injection of 40 mg 
(0.4  ml)  AVT02  on  day  1,  either  via  manually  by  a  PFS  or  with  an  AI  in  the  fasted  state  (water  was 
allowed). The PK blood samples, and immunogenicity samples were collected at the same time points as 
in the pivotal PK study AVT02-GL-101 (see above). 204 subjects (N = 100 in PFS group and N = 104 in 
AI group; aged 18 to 55 years, BMI between 18.5 to 32.0 kg/m2) were randomised and dosed and 197 
subjects completed the study. 
PK results 
The PK population consisted of 198 subjects (N = 99 in PFS group and N = 99 in AI group). 
In the comparison between treatment groups, the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric LS means for the 
primary  PK  parameters  of  Cmax,  AUC0-t,  and  AUC0-inf  were  all  contained  within  the  pre-specified 
bioequivalence margins of 80% and 125%, thus demonstrating that systemic exposure after AVT02-AI 
administration was bioequivalent to exposure after AVT02-PFS administration (Table 5).

AVT02  concentrations  were  slightly  above  those  of  EU-Humira  at  all  time  points  measured  including 
those  at  steady-state  (Figures  2  and  3  and  Tables  6  and  7);  however,  the  total  exposure  was 
considered comparable.

2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Validated PD markers do not exist for the efficacy of TNF-α inhibitors and therefore, no 
pharmacodynamic data were evaluated in the Phase 1 bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects. 
Regarding the primary PD, a set of non-clinical in vitro studies have been performed. No studies on 
secondary PD have been provided, nor have they been required according to the EMA guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalytics 
Analysis of adalimumab in serum was performed and validated by Nuvisan GmgH, Neu-Ulm, Germany. 
Immunogenicity  testing  including  detection  of  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA)  and  neutralizing  antibodies 
(Nab) were performed by BioAgilytix GmbH, Hamburg, Germany. The bioanalytical methods used in the 
clinical studies for AVT02 have been validated according to the relevant guidelines.  The CHMP requested 
that the applicant preforms further testing to provide long-term stability data, which will be submitted 
in post-authorisation phase; please see the list of recommendations in section 4.

Pharmacokinetics 
Two clinical studies were performed, in which the PK of AVT02 was compared to that of EU-Humira and 
one in which also; the US-Humira was as a comparator product. The pivotal PK study (AVT02-GL-101) 
was performed in healthy subjects, in which adalimumab was administered 40 mg s.c. as a single dose 
in  a  PFS.  The  clinical  study  AVT02-GL-301  was  performed  in  PsO  patients,  in  which  AVT02  and 
EU-Humira, after an 80 mg loading dose, were administered every other week in dose of 40 mg s.c. in 
a PFS. In addition, PK of AVT02 was evaluated in the device comparison study (AVT02-GL-102), in which 
adalimumab  was  administered  in  40  mg  s.c.  single-dose  using  PFS  or  AI  in  healthy  subjects.  The 
applicant  has  two  presentations  of  the  test  product.  One  has  a  nominal  filling  volume  of  0.4  ml  and 
another 0.8 ml. Both presentations contain adalimumab at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. In the clinical 
studies, the presentation 40 mg/0.4 ml has been used. For the 80 mg/0.8 ml presentation, there is no 
need for additional clinical data, as the pharmaceutical data submitted are acceptable. 
Pivotal clinical PK study in healthy subjects (AVT02-GL-101) 
The  study  design  was  satisfactory.  A  parallel  design  was  acceptable  considering  the  long  half-life  of 
adalimumab (approximately 2 weeks) and the potential influence of immunogenicity. The use of healthy 
subjects  is  agreed  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing 
monoclonal  antibodies  –  non-clinical  and  clinical  issues.  The  treatment  groups  were  similar  in  age, 
ethnicity  and  BMI  in  whole  study.  The  40  mg  s.c.  dose  is  the  normally  recommended  and  the  use  is 
endorsed. 
The primary endpoints AUC0-inf and AUC0-t were based on PK samples collected up to 9 weeks. The PK 
sampling period was not long enough for all subjects, because in the AVT02 group, eleven subjects’, in 
the EU-Humira group five subjects’ and in the US-Humira group nine subjects’ AUC0-inf was > 20% of 
AUC0-t indicating  that  the  sampling  period  for  these  subjects  has  been  too  short.  The  amount  of  the 
subjects with non-optimal concentration profiles can be considered comparable between studied groups 
and to have no big impact on the PK results. The all-above-mentioned subjects were included in the PK 
analyses. 
The study included two parts with sample size re-estimation occurring after Part 1. An interim analysis 
for early bioequivalence was conducted as well. Sample size re-estimation and bioequivalence analysis 
have the potential for Type 1 error inflation. The applicant provided a response with a detailed rationale 
and references for the use of Fisher´s combination test and discuss the overall concept for multiplicity 
control of all variables that were considered in the formal interim analysis. 
In  addition,  during  evaluation  of  the  data  available  for  the  interim  analysis,  one  outlier  subject  was 
identified in the data and excluded from the statistical analysis as from the observed concentrations and 
the  time  to  Cmax  at  least  part  of  the  dose  was  given  by  the  i.v.  route  (e.g.,  by  tapping  a  s.c.  vein). 
However, exclusion of data cannot be accepted for PK reasons alone. In addition, the outlier was removed 
from the analysis together with data from 5 randomly selected additional subjects (resulting in a total of 
2 subjects from each treatment arm being excluded) in order to preserve the blind for the sponsor. This 
was not agreed. The applicant provided a response to this item, however, additional subjects from the 
part 1 were excluded from the final PK analysis due to incomplete sampling around Cmax (2 subjects) and 
incomplete PK sampling (early withdrawal) (1 subject) and it was not clear why these subjects had not 
been also mentioned to be excluded at time of the interim analysis for the sample size re-estimation of 
the part 2. Upon CHMP’s request the applicant provided clarifications regarding the lack of exclusion of 
additional  three  subjects.  Considering  the  arguments  provided  and  that  the  conducted  sensitivity 
analyses with Fisher Combination test, with and without all excluded subjects, as well as the conventional 
method without the excluded subjects had no effect on the conclusion of bioequivalence, the issue is not 
further pursued.

The adalimumab concentration time profiles were quite flat and consequently, only three or four time 
points during the terminal log-linear phase were used in estimation of elimination rate constant. 
The applicant provided results of the statistical analysis including also data of these 10 subjects excluded 
from the PK analysis. Both results (without and with data of these 10 subjects) were contained within 
the pre-defined bioequivalence margins of 80% and 125%. The results were consistent with the primary 
bioequivalence  analysis  conducted  on  the  PK  analyses  set  with  the  exclusion  of  the  10  subjects.  In 
addition,  the  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  supported  the  results  of  the  primary  bioequivalence 
analysis.  
In conclusion, the justification of the applicant for the exclusion of these 10 subjects from the PK analysis 
is  considered  acceptable.  The  90%  CIs  of  the  geometric  LS  mean  ratios  for  the  three  primary  PK 
parameters were all within 80% and 125%. In the AUC0-t between AVT02 and EU-Humira, the lower limit 
of 90%CI was 1.00, which is considered acceptable. The sensitivity analysis supported the PK similarity 
between AVT02 and EU-Humira. 
The 90% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios for the 3 primary PK parameters were not all within 0.80 
to 1.25 in Japanese subgroup. These comparisons can be considered qualitative only, because the study 
was not originally powered to conduct a formal statistical analysis in subgroup. 
There has been mistakes in administration of adalimumab. In 4 subjects adalimumab was administered 
by  an  i.v.  administration  instead  of  s.c.  administration.  These  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  PK 
population  and  it  can  be  considered  adequate.  However,  the  occurrence  of  i.v.  administration  raised 
uncertainties regarding proper training of the staff and adequate study conduct. The applicant was asked 
to  explain  in  more  detail  how  this  misconduct  could  happen  and  provide  assurance  of  appropriate 
qualification of the personnel involved in the study. On the basis of the provided data in the response, 
all efforts have been made to train the study personnel to conduct study properly and administer study 
drugs correctly.  
The applicant has declared on what basis the needle angle was chosen to be 90º in the pilot study AVT02-
GL-100 and at the beginning of the PK pivotal study AVT02-GL-101, although in the Humira PL the angle 
for the s.c. administration with PFS is 45º. In the response the applicant has clarified that the needle 
angle was erroneously stated to be 90º instead of 45º. The error was corrected by a non-substantial 
amendment. The changes included in this non-substantial protocol amendment were incorporated into 
protocol amendment 2 (protocol version 3.0 dated 6.5.2019). On the basis of the provided instruction 
materials for right administration before the study dosing, it can be maintained that all administrations 
were made correctly using 45º angle of needle.  
Clinical device study to compare PK of AVT02 when administered from PFS and from AI (AVT02-GL-
102) 
The selected PK sampling schedule up to 9 weeks has been sufficient for a majority of the subjects 
(i.e., AUC0-t covered over 80% of AUC0-inf). There was however, 8 subjects in the AVT02-AI group 
and 4 subjects in the AVT02-PFS group, in which AUC0-inf was over 20% of AUC0-t demonstrating that 
the sampling period was too short. Ten of these 12 subjects have Clast concentration > 1000 ng/ml. In 
calculation of the elimination phase (kel and t1/2), generally only 3 time points were used (there were 
cases, where even 13 time points were used in calculation). The inter-subject variation in the AVT02 
absorption phase and in the Cmax was lower than in the elimination phase (i.e., in AUCs, kel, t1/2, 
CL/F and Vz/F. The AVT02 PK profiles were very flat for many subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 48/122 
 
 
 
 
All 90%CIs for AVT02-PFS to AVT02-AI ratios of primary PK parameters (i.e., Cmax, AUC0-t and 
AUC0-inf) were within the pre-specified acceptance window of 80% to 125% (including 100%). The 
bioequivalence between AVT02-AI and AVT02-PFS was demonstrated. 
Clinical study in patients with moderate-to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (AVT02-GL-301) 
The batch DP180004 for the test product (i.e., for AVT02) has been used in all clinical studies. The 
certificate of analysis for the test batch has been presented in Module 3. For test batches (i.e., EU 
Humira batches (i.e., batches 87387XH06, 95480XH04, 91433XH03, 06046XH05) the certificates of 
analyses have been provided, as requested. The mean trough concentrations have been slightly higher 
in the AVT02 group than in the EU-Humira group both on overall population (PK data up to week 16) 
and on PASI responders (PK data on PASI responders from 0 to week 24). The steady-state mean 
trough concentrations (5-7 µg/ml) are at the same level as reported in the clinical studies in psoriasis 
patients with original Humira (mean trough concentrations 5 µg/ml at steady-state, source: Humira 
SmPC). The variations (CV%) in the trough concentrations were large; however, quite same level 
between studied treatments. The differences in the median and geometric mean trough concentrations 
between AVT02 and EU-Humira were greater than in the mean values. Consequently, the applicant 
was asked to use geometric means of trough concentrations and perform a direct comparison of the 
trough concentrations between AVT02 group (n=205) and EU-Humira group (n=207) from week 0 to 
week 16 and between AVT02/AVT02 group vs EU-Humira/AVT02 group, AVT02/AVT02 group vs EU-
Humira/EU-Humira group and EU-Humira/AVT02 group vs EU-Humira/EU-Humira group on PASI 
responders from week 0 to week 24, presenting point estimates and 90%CIs of the concentration 
ratios for all time points where the PK measurements were done. In the response, since the final study 
AVT02-GL-301 data were available, the applicant also presented the requested data up to week 54. 
The ratios of geometric means were generally higher in subjects treated with AVT02 compared to 
subjects treated with EU-Humira; however, almost all 90%CIs contain 1, indicating that there is no 
considerable difference between treatment groups. The differences in the Ctrough concentrations can be 
considered not clinically meaningful. 
No clinical studies in special populations and no in vitro or in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were 
conducted with the AVT02 and this is acceptable. 
In the proposed AVT02 SmPC the PK text in Section “Pharmacokinetic properties” was taken from the 
Humira SmPC. As the AVT02 and Humira are considered to be biosimilar it is acceptable to use Humira 
SmPC text. 
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

2.7.2.  Main study 
AVT02-GL-301 (ALVOPAD PS) 
Title: A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active control study to compare the 
efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of AVT02 versus EU-Humira in patients with moderate-to-severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis (ALVOPAD PS). 
Methods 
Study AVT02-GL-301 is a 54-week study conducted in 2 stages: Stage 1 through Week 16 with a 
double-blind efficacy assessment and Stage 2 from week 16 through Week 50 with a double-blind, 
long-term efficacy and safety assessment, and follow-up for 4 weeks through Week 54. At Week 16, 
nonresponsive patients (less than 50% improvement in PASI) were withdrawn from the study. 
Responsive patients (at least PASI 50) began Stage 2 of the active period. At week 16, responders who 
were initially randomised in to receive Humira were re-randomised 1:1 into Groups 2A and 2B to 
receive either AVT02 (Group 2A) or Humira (Group 2B). 
An overview of the study design of Study AVT02-GL-301 is presented in Figure 4.

Study Participants 
The study was conducted at 20 study centres located in four countries: Estonia, Georgia, Poland and 
Ukraine. 
Male or female patients aged 18 to 75 years of age with stable moderate to severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis for at least 2 months who had a previous failure, inadequate response, intolerance, or 
contraindication to at least 1 systemic antipsoriatic therapy (including, but not limited to, 
methotrexate, cyclosporine, psoralen plus ultraviolet light A (PUVA), and ultraviolet light B (UVB)) were 
eligible for the study.

Moderate to severe PsO was defined by an involved body surface area (BSA) ≥10% (Palm Method), 
≥12 on the PASI, and static Physicians Global Assessments (sPGA) ≥3 (moderate) at Screening and at 
BL. 
Subject were excluded if diagnosed with erythrodermic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, 
medication-induced psoriasis, other skin conditions (eg, eczema), or other systemic autoimmune 
disorder inflammatory disease at the time of the Screening Visit that could have interfered with 
evaluations of the effect of the study drug on psoriasis. 
Previous use of not more than 1 prior biologics for treatment of PsO was allowed. 
Prior use of any of the following medications within specified time periods or required use during the 
study was ground for exclusion: 
a.  Topical medications within 2 weeks of BL (Week 1). 
b.  PUVA phototherapy and/or UVB phototherapy within 4 weeks prior to the BL Visit. 
c.  Nonbiologic psoriasis systemic therapies (e.g., cyclosporine, methotrexate, and acitretin) within 
4 weeks prior to the BL Visit. 
d.  Any prior or concomitant or biosimilar adalimumab therapy, either approved or investigational. 
e.  Any systemic steroid in the 4 weeks prior to BL. 
Immunosuppressed patients (for any reason) were excluded. 
A detailed listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria was provided in the CSR (M 5.3.5.1). 
Only responsive subjects (subjects who achieved at least PASI 50) continued to Stage 2 of the study 
(beyond week 16). 
Treatments 
During Stage 1 (through Week 16): 
Subjects in Group 1 received an initial loading dose of AVT02 80 mg (2 × 40 mg) administered s.c., 
followed by 40 mg given s.c. once every other week (EOW) starting 1 week after the loading dose and 
continued to receive AVT02 until Week 14. Subjects in Group 2 received an initial loading dose of 
Humira 80 mg (2 × 40 mg) administered s.c., followed by 40 mg given s.c. EOW starting 1 week after 
the loading dose and continued to receive Humira until Week 14. 
At Week 16: 
•  Non-responsive subjects (less than 50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
[PASI 50]) were withdrawn from the study. 
•  Responsive subjects (at least PASI 50) began Stage 2 (long-term efficacy and safety 
assessment) of the active period. 
During Stage 2 (from Week 16 through Week 54): 
•  Responders who were initially randomised in Group 1 (AVT02) continued to receive AVT02 
40 mg s.c. EOW from Week 16 through Week 48. 
•  Responders who were initially randomised in Group 2 (Humira) were re-randomised into 
Groups 2A and 2B, in a 1:1 ratio. 
-  Responders who were re-randomised into Group 2A started to receive AVT02 (40 mg EOW) 
from Week 16 through Week 48. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 52/122 
 
 
 
-  Responders who were re-randomised into Group 2B continued to receive Humira (40 mg 
EOW) from Week 16 through Week 48. 
Only the PFS presentation was used in study AVT02-GL-301. Injection sites were to be rotated 
between abdomen and thighs. 
No rescue treatments were described. 
Objectives 
Primary Study Objective 
The primary objective was to assess the equivalence by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 
AVT02 to EU-approved Humira with regards to efficacy at Week 16 in subjects with moderate to severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis. 
Equivalence was considered achieved if the 90% CI (as required by FDA)/95% CI (as required by EMA) 
lay within (-10%, 10%). 
Secondary Study Objectives 
• 
• 
• 
To compare the efficacy of AVT02 and Humira in subjects with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis at week 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 42, and 50. 
To compare steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of AVT02 and Humira. 
To compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of AVT02 and Humira at Weeks 16, 24, 
32, 42, and 50. 
The applicant states that there will be no formal comparisons between the treatment groups for Stage 
2 (data after Week 24). 
Exploratory Study Objectives 
• 
To compare the efficacy of AVT02 and Humira in subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) at Week 12. 
•  Change from Baseline (BL) in Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) at Week 12 
(only for PsA). 
• 
To assess ex-vivo immunogenicity by T-cell proliferation and cytokine production in a subset of 
subjects at Weeks 1, 8, and 16. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent improvement in PASI from BL to Week 16. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for the Primary CSR were: 
•  Percent improvement in PASI from BL to Weeks 8, 12, and 24. 
•  PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 response rate at Weeks 16 and 24. 
•  Number and percentage of subjects achieving static Physician’s Global Assessments (sPGA) 
responses of clear (0) or almost clear (1) at Weeks 16 and 24. 
•  Change from BL in quality of life as measured by Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
scores at Weeks 16 and 24. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 53/122 
 
 
 
 
The following exploratory efficacy endpoints were reported as part of the Primary CSR: 
•  The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 12 in subjects with PsA. 
•  Change from BL in Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) at Week 12 (only for 
PsA). 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be reported as part of the Final CSR: 
•  The percent improvement in PASI from BL to Weeks 32, 42, and 50. 
•  PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 response rate at Week 50. 
•  Number and percentage of subjects achieving sPGA responses of clear (0) or almost clear (1) 
at Week 50 
•  Change from BL in quality of life as measured by DLQI scores at Week 50. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
The PK endpoint was to compare serum trough levels of AVT02 and Humira at steady-state. 
Safety: 
The safety variables evaluated were the frequency, type, and severity of adverse events (AEs) 
including adverse drug reactions; the frequency and severity of injection site reactions (ISRs); routine 
safety parameters, including laboratory safety, vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG) results, chest X-ray, and physical examination findings. 
Other: 
Other evaluation criteria were the detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to AVT02 or Humira at 
Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 50, and Early Termination (ET)/ EoS Follow-up (Week 54). Ex-vivo 
immunogenicity was measured by T-cell proliferation and cytokine production in a subset of subjects at 
Weeks 1, 8, and 16. The results of the ex-vivo immunogenicity analyses are planned to be presented 
in a separate report. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
At Stage 1: Patient randomisation was stratified by presence or absence of PsA, and by prior use of a 
biologic therapy for the treatment of PsO or PsA. Approximately 400 patients were to be randomly 
assigned to receive either AVT02 or Humira in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 200/arm). 
At Stage 2 (Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Assessment): Responsive patients (patients who achieve at 
least PASI 50) who were taking Humira in Stage 1 were re-randomised into Groups AVT02 and Humira, 
in a 1:1 ratio at Week 16. 
Subjects were assigned to study drug in accordance with the randomisation schedule generated using 
permuted block randomisation by an independent statistician. 
Blinding of the study was achieved by the following measures: 
• 
The EU-Humira and AVT02 syringes were masked by packaging that concealed the syringes during 
Stages 1 and 2 (double-blind treatment period) of the study. 
•  After the 24-week database lock, the Sponsor and the CRO will be partly unblinded, but the study 
remains double-blinded. In order to prevent accidental unblinding, dedicated blinded and unblinded 
teams were implemented within the Sponsor and CRO prior to the Week 24 database lock. The 
study still continues as a blinded study to the Investigator, subject, and dedicated Sponsor/CRO

representatives who are unaware of treatment assignment until study closure and final database 
lock. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS), consistent with the intention-to-treat principle, is defined as all 
randomised subjects who received at least one dose of randomised study drug. 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) is a subset of the FAS which includes subjects who have completed Stage 1 
and do not have a protocol violation that would affect evaluation of the primary objective of the study. 
Protocol deviations should be collected by site and grouped into different categories. These deviations 
(major/minor) were reviewed and identified by the Sponsor before database lock. 
The PPS is defined broadly as follows: 
•  Subject completes the 16-week Stage 1 with Week 16 PASI score reported 
•  Subject without the following major protocol deviations: 
o  Receiving the wrong treatment according to the randomisation. 
o  Missing baseline and/or week 16 PASI measures. 
o  Noncompliance of inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
o 
Inappropriate PASI evaluation. 
o  Receipt of certain protocol-prohibited medications. 
The PPS is used for the sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint. Summaries of subject 
demographics and baseline disease characteristics will also be presented for the PPS. 
Primary Analysis 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model to assess the efficacy of  AVT02 compared with Humira at 
Week 16 will be used for the FAS set. The ANCOVA model includes percent improvement as response 
variable,  treatment  and  2  stratification  factors  as  factors  and  baseline  PASI  score  as  covariate.  This 
analysis provides standard error estimates for least squares means and their differences between group 
means adjusted for the factors and covariate. The two-sided 90%/95% CIs of the differences of least 
squares means between the AVT02 and Humira groups will be calculated. Equivalence is achieved if the 
90% CI (as required by FDA)/95% CI (as required by EMA) lie within (-10%, 10%). 
Missing percent improvement will be imputed using last observation carry-forward method (LOCF) for 
subjects with post-baseline assessment in Stage 1. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
To  test  the  robustness  of  primary  analysis,  the  following  different  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary 
endpoint will be performed. 
• 
• 
• 
The primary analysis will be repeated using the PP set 
The primary analysis will be repeated with an additional random effects term for site. 
The primary analysis will be repeated using only completers at Week 16. 
•  Mixed effect Model Repeat Measurement (MMRM) analysis will be performed for the FAS set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 55/122 
 
 
 
 
The  MMRM  analysis  will  include  percent  improvement  from  BL  as  response  variable,  treatment, 
2 stratification factors, baseline PASI score, visit and visit time point-by-treatment interaction terms as 
explanatory  variables.  An  unstructured  covariance  structure  will  be  used  to  model  the  within-subject 
errors.  If  there  is  a  convergence  issue  with  the  unstructured  covariance  model,  compound  symmetry 
covariance structure will be used.

Approximately half of subjects had at least 1 ongoing medical condition (100 AVT02 subjects [48.8%] 
and 110 Humira subjects [53.1%]). The most common ongoing medical condition SOC was vascular 
disorders (22.6%), and the most common preferred term was hypertension (20.9%). 
Similar numbers of subjects used concomitant medications through Week 24; at initial randomisation 
118 AVT02 subjects [57.6%] and 127 Humira subjects [61.4%] used any concomitant medication. 
Numbers analysed 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS), consistent with the intention-to-treat principle, was defined as all 
randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of randomised study drug. 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) was a subset of the FAS which included subjects who completed Stage 1 
and did not have a protocol deviation that would affect evaluation of the primary objective of the 
study. The Safety Analysis Set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, with 
treatment assignment based on actual treatment received.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome 
Percent improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
The  ANCOVA  analysis  of  the  percent  improvement  in  PASI  from  BL  shows  that  AVT02  is  within  the 
predefined equivalence margin of ±10% for the 95% CI at Week 16 compared to Humira (Table 12 and 
Table  13).  Mean  actual  PASI  scores  fell  from  23.2  and  23.0  at  baseline  to  2.0  and  1.7  at  week  16 
(observed data) for AVT02 and Humira, respectively.

%BSA and Physician’s Global Assessments (sPGA) 
The  percentage  (SD)  of  body  surface  area  (%BSA)  affected  by  psoriasis  was  32.3  (17.84)  and 
31.7 (17.88)  for  AVT02  and  Humira  treatment  arms  respectively  at  baseline.  At  week  16  the 
corresponding percentages were 5.0 (11.22) and 3.7 (6.90). The results further slightly improved and 
remained  similar  between  treatment  arms  up  to  week  24  and  through  week  50,  being  3.2  (7.46), 
2.9 (4.44) and 2.9 (4.83) at week 24 in the AVT02/AVT02, Humira/AVT02 and Humira/Humira groups, 
respectively. 
The Physician’s Global Assessments (sPGA) of plaque psoriasis was assessed on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 
indicating no psoriasis (clear of disease), 1 (almost clear), and 2 or higher scores indicating more severe 
disease.  According  to  inclusion  criteria,  all  subjects  had  involved  body  surface  area  (BSA)  ≥10%  and 
sPGA ≥ 3(moderate) at baseline. The percentage of subjects achieving clear (0) or almost clear (1) on 
the sPGA was comparable at each time point up to week 50 across treatment groups (Table 18).

Ancillary analyses 
PASI Subgroup Analysis 
Subgroup analyses showed consistency between AVT02 and Humira treatment groups with respect to 
the primary endpoint in both the FAS and PPS in respect to gender, PsA, use of prior biologic therapy 
and age (Figure 9). The effect of ADA presence on efficacy is presented and discussed in section 4.8 of 
the  clinical  AR.  While  AVT02  showed  significantly  better  efficacy  than  Humira  among  ADA  negative 
subjects  in  the  FAS  population  (LOCF  analysis),  the  results  were  similar  between  groups  in  the  per-
protocol analysis set (PPS).

Results and Analysis 
Primary Analysis 
Analysis description 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model to assess the efficacy of AVT02 versus Humira at Week 16 
was used for the Full Analysis Set (FAS) using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation. 
The ANCOVA model includes percent improvement as response variable, treatment, and 2 stratification 
factors (presence or absence of PsA and prior use of biologic therapy for the treatment of PsO or PsA) as 
factors and baseline PASI score as covariate. 
Analysis population and time

Result: 
The mean percent PASI improvement from BL to each timepoint through Week 16 was comparable in 
the AVT02 and Humira groups in both the LOCF analysis (see below) and the observed data analysis (in 
the FAS (see CSR AVT02-GL-301 ). 
From Week 16 through Week 50 (Stage 2), the mean percent PASI improvement remained similar at 
each timepoint to those at Week 16 across the treatment groups.

Not applicable. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies were performed in special populations and none are required in the biosimilar setting. The 
pivotal efficacy study AVT02-GL-301 included 22 subjects (5.3%) over the age of 65 years. 
2.7.3.  Supportive studyies 
Study AVT02-GL-303 Study AVT02 HF validation AI 
Real-life subject handling experience with the use of the autoinjector (AI) was studied in subjects with 
moderate to severe active RA who self-injected AVT02 s.c. in a single arm repeated dose study (AVT02-
GL-303). After initial training, all 107 subjects were able to self-inject successfully, as recorded by the 
Observer  Assessment  Tool  (OAT)  and  the  Participant  Assessment  Tool  (PAT),  and  no  handling  events 
were recorded. It was concluded that the AI device can be used and self-injected to deliver the medicinal 
product to the target population.  
The applicant stated that the assessments that were used in the study are commonly used, standard 
measurements frequently seen in RA studies. However, no references were provided, and these OAT and 
PAT questionnaires are not familiar to the assessor. It seems that the tools used to assess usability in 
study  AVT02-GL-303  were  not  optimal.  The  questionnaires  do  not  provide  any  useful  information 
regarding a possible need for amendment of the IFU. 
However, the results obtained from this study support usability and combined with the results from the 
HF study, sufficient data was obtained also regarding details in the IFU. 
A  human  factors  summative  study  (AVT02  HF  validation  AI)  was  performed  to  determine  if  the 
autoinjector can be used safely and effectively without patterns of preventable use errors or difficulties 
that  could  result  in  serious  harm  to  the  intended  users  or  patients.  Adult  Patients  with  RA  (n  =  15 
(12 males and 3 female)), Adolescent Patients with JIA (n = 15), Caregivers (n = 15), and HCPs (n = 15)

performed simulated injections and performance was evaluated using a user task checklist. The study 
was representative of the intended population. 
The task list followed the instructions of the IFU in a total of 1547 recordings, there were 163 use errors 
recorded. Five types of critical use errors were observed during the course of the study: Lifting up AI too 
early, failing to store AI in fridge, inappropriate disposal of AI, failing to correctly identify injection site, 
not correctly understanding the number of autoinjectors at a higher (loading) dose. The observed use 
errors were few and were not considered by the applicant to be further preventable through practicable 
means.  The applicant confirmed that the sections on IFU, storage, handling and disposal in the SmPC 
and  PL  intended  for  the  EU  market  are  comparable  with  the  Medication  Guide  and  the  Prescribing 
Information intended for the US market. 
Overall, the study report provides evidence on safe AI usability. In the pivotal efficacy study AVT02-GL-
301, the subject/caregiver were provided training on the s.c. administration of the study drug by PFS 
and on the disposal of the used syringe. As the IFU is adequate and no specific problems emerged during 
self-injection in study AVT02-GL-301, the lack of specific usability data for the PFS is acceptable. 
2.7.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To demonstrate the therapeutic equivalence in terms of efficacy and safety, including immunogenicity, 
the applicant conducted one pivotal randomised clinical trial (Study AVT02-GL-301) in patients with 
moderate to severe psoriasis (PsO). 
The choice of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis as study population is acceptable 
as  the  concomitant  immunosuppressive  therapies  that  may  interfere  with  treatment  effects  and 
immunogenicity are generally not used in psoriasis and established and sensitive outcome measures are 
available for psoriasis trials. In addition, the choice of the patient population was agreed in the EMA/CHMP 
scientific advice. 
The  proposed  indications  are  the  same  indications  as  for  EU-Humira.  An  extrapolation  rational  for 
indications held by the reference product, EU-Humira, was provided in Module 2.2 Introduction. 
The dose and dosing regimen of EU-Humira and AVT02 used in the equivalence trial are in accordance 
with the Humira SmPC. The allowed and prohibited treatments are acceptable. 
The  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  are  appropriate  and  in  line  with  the  Humira  SmPC.  The  demographic 
characteristics  and  PsO  characteristics  were  comparable  between  groups  at  baseline.  The  study 
objectives are adequate for an equivalence trial of a biosimilar candidate. 
The 1-year duration is adequate to compare longer-term efficacy and safety, including immunogenicity 
as it is in line with the EMA guideline “Immunogenicity assessment of biotechnology-derived therapeutic 
proteins”  (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006).  In  Stage  1  of  the  study  (week  1-16),  413 subjects  were 
randomised to receive either AVT02 or Humira 40 mg s.c. once every other week (EOW) starting 1 week 
after a loading dose of 80 mg. Only responsive subjects (at least PASI 50) continued beyond week 16. 
This approach is endorsed since it is stated in the Humira SmPC that treatment should not be continued 
beyond  week  16  in  non-responders.  At  week  16,  subjects  who  initially  received  Humira  were  re-
randomised to continue with either AVT02 or Humira, with the intention to clarify the interchangeability 
between the biosimilar and the originator. Hence, treatment was continued from week 16 up to week 48 
in three parallel arms: Maintenance AVT02, Maintenance Humira and Switch AVT02. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 72/122 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint in Study AVT02-GL-301 was the percent improvement in PASI from BL to 
Week  16.  As  pointed  out in  the  scientific  advice  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/859223/2018),  percent  change  in 
PASI is an acceptable primary endpoint. However, in equivalence trials, week 8 is considered to be the 
most  appropriate  timing  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  PsO,  as  a  plateau  in  efficacy  response  is 
normally reached by week 12, rendering the sensitivity to detect differences at later stages insufficient. 
Hence, week 16 is not the optimal time point for the primary efficacy analysis. Therefore, the efficacy 
assessment will rely on the totality of data and week 8 in particular. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints, including percent improvement in PASI at weeks 8, 12 and 24, the 
PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 response rates, the sPGA response and the DLQI score are 
adequate and in line with relevant guidelines. In respect to secondary efficacy assessment, only ‘Percent 
improvement in PASI from BL to Week 8, 12’ was assessed using the same methods as for the primary 
endpoint. The results of all other secondary endpoints have been analysed descriptively. 
The equivalence margin for the primary endpoint was predefined as -10%, 10% with a 95% CI. This 
margin  can  be  acceptable  as  an  even  broader  margin  has  been  approved  in  previous  adalimumab 
applications.  
During  initial  assessment,  some  concerns  arose  regarding  proper  conduct  of  the  study.  For  example, 
three patients at site 3808 (Ukraine) had positive adalimumab concentrations at baseline combined with 
a  very  high  proportion  (20%)  of  patients  had  anti-adalimumab  antibodies  at  baseline.  The  applicant 
provided sufficient assurance of appropriate study conduct, how principal investigators (PI) and study 
personnel  were  trained  and  how  it  was  ensured  that  the  staff  had  sufficient  understanding  of  the 
principles of GCP and study procedures. Acceptable efforts have also been made to ensure that included 
subjects had no previous exposure of adalimumab. 
Since there were only three subjects with non-zero adalimumab at baseline, and the subjects were not 
all in the same treatment arm, their impact on the outcome is negligible and additional analyses are not 
required for these subjects.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
205 subjects in the AVT02 arm and 207 subjects in the Humira arm initiated treatment. Demographic 
characteristics  were  similar  across  both  treatment  groups  at  screening.  22  subjects  (5.3%)  were 
≥65 years. The BL disease characteristics were similar across the treatment groups. The mean baseline 
PASI score was 23.08. Most of the subjects (231 subjects, 56.1%) were rated as moderate on the sPGA, 
7.8% were rated severe, while mild or moderate disease forms were not included per protocol. 
Primary outcome 
Both treatment arms showed significant improvement by week 16 (89.2% vs 86.9% in the LOCF FAS 
analysis  and  90.9%  vs  90.6%  in  the  PPS  analysis  for  AVT02  and  Humira  respectively).  The  percent 
improvement from BL in PASI status was in line with previous findings with adalimumab. 
The 95% CI of the primary endpoint - mean difference in percent improvement in PASI from baseline to 
week 16 in the LOCF FAS - was within the predefined equivalence margin of ±10%. The 95% CI for all 
sensitivity analyses were within ±10%. Hence, the primary objective was met, and sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the robustness of the primary analysis. 
As the dropout rate was low, and protocol deviations were rare, results from the LOCF FAS analysis were 
very similar to the observed data FAS results as well as the PPS results. Since the FAS is not always 
considered conservative in equivalence trials, the PPS analyses are an important addition.  
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 73/122 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary outcome 
The mean difference in percent improvement in PASI from baseline to Week 8 was 0.2 (95% CI: -4.55 
to 4.20) in the FAS LOCF analysis. The 95% CI:s were within ±10% for all time points up to week 16. 
Since the differences between groups were very small at all time points and confidence intervals were 
narrow, no sensitivity analyses are requested for week 8, even if this would have been the preferred 
time point for primary analyses. It is concluded that similarity in PASI change from baseline was shown 
also at the most sensitive time points. 
In the subset of patients continuing into Stage 2 of the study, the actual PASI scores and changes from 
baseline  remained  essentially  similar  between  AVT02  and  Humira  treatment  groups  throughout  the 
study, up to week 50. 
Subgroup  analyses  at  week  16  showed  no  significant  difference  with  respect  to  the  primary  endpoint 
between AVT02 and Humira treatment groups when analysed by gender, PsA status, use of prior biologic 
therapy  or  age.  While  AVT02  showed  significantly  better  efficacy  than  Humira  among  ADA  negative 
subjects in the FAS LOCF analysis, the results were similar between groups in the observed data and in 
the per-protocol analysis set. Hence, this does not preclude a conclusion of similarity. The effect of ADA 
formation on efficacy is further discussed in section 3.3.8.  
Through Week 16, the percentage of subjects achieving PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 at 
each time point was similar across treatment groups. At most, the difference in point estimate for PASI75 
was  3.9%  at  week  8.  The  PASI  75  response  was  achieved  for  125  (61.6%)  subjects  in  the  AVT02 
treatment  group  and  133  (65.5%)  subjects  in  the  Humira  treatment  group  at  week  8  (FAS).  This 
difference is considered negligible, since it is not seen consistently at other time points and in other PASI 
response  outcome.  In  Stage  2  of  the  study,  up  to  week  50,  the  response  rates  remained  essentially 
similar between AVT02 and Humira treatment groups. 
Through Week 50, the %BSA affected by psoriasis as well as the percentage of subjects achieving clear 
(0) or almost clear (1) on the sPGA was comparable at each time point across treatment groups. The 
change from BL in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was similar across treatment groups at each 
time point through Week 16 and Week 50. Also, efficacy results in the subset of patients with PsA were 
compatible with similarity. 
Overall,  the  results  of  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  support  the  results  of  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoints assessment. 
2.7.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  design  of  the  pivotal  study  to  demonstrate  therapeutic  equivalence  was  adequate.  Primary  and 
secondary efficacy outcome were consistent and compatible with similarity principles.  
2.8.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile of AVT02 has been investigated in two PK-studies conducted in healthy volunteers 
(AVT02-GL-101 and AVT02-GL-102 comparing PFS and AI), in one equivalence efficacy and safety 
study (AVT02-301), conducted in patients with moderate to severe PsA and in RA patients in an AI 
real-life handling study (AVT02-GL-303); see Table 3.3.1 for study descriptions. 
For all clinical trials, safety analyses were performed on the safety population, which included all 
randomised subjects who received any amount of IP and was analysed according to the actual 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 74/122 
 
 
 
 
treatment received, if this differed from that to which the subject was randomised. The Safety 
Population was used for the summaries of all safety data. 
During the procedure, the applicant provided a safety update from the two still ongoing studies, 
AVT02-GL-302 and AVT02-GL-303. Safety data from first 8 weeks of the study AVT02-GL-303 were 
included in the applicant’s initial submission. AVT02-GL-302 is a new study not included in initial 
submission (see the description in Table 3.3.1). The applicant’s safety update report considers the 
narratives on any deaths, other TESAEs, AESIs with exclusion of ISRs and premature study 
discontinuation for safety grounds that occurred for the time periods that start from the first patient 
screened in study AVT02-GL-302 and from Week 9 in study AVT02-GL-303 until the data extraction 
point 22 Mar 2021 in both studies. 
Patient exposure 
In the clinical trials included in this application, safety of AVT02 was investigated in 334 adult healthy 
male and female subjects (single s.c. dose of 40 mg), in 302 (205 in Stage 1 plus 97 switching from 
Humira  to  AVT02  in  Stage  2)  adult  patients  with  chronic  plaque  psoriasis  (PsO,  multiple  s.c.  doses 
through Week 48, initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg EOW starting 1 week after the loading dose) 
and 107 patients with RA (multiple s.c. doses of 40 mg EOW through Week 54). 
Phase III study AVT02-GL-301 in patients with PsO 
Exposure, both in terms of mean duration and mean number of injections, was comparable in AVT02 
and  Humira  groups  through  Week  16,  from  Week  16  through  Week  50  (Stage  2),  and  from  baseline 
through Week 50. The mean duration of treatment in subjects receiving AVT02/AVT02 was 31.3 weeks, 
31.7  weeks  in  the  Humira/AVT02  group,  and  30.9  weeks  in  the  Humira/Humira  group,  over  which 
subjects received an average of 16 injections across the treatment groups. 
Phase I study AVT02-GL-101 in healthy subjects 
A total of 390 subjects received a single 40 mg s.c. dose of investigational product (IP). One subject 
randomised  to  the  EU-Humira  group  had  an  IP  dispensing  error  and  received  a  single  dose  of  AVT02 
instead. Therefore, based on the actual treatment received, 130 subjects received AVT02, 129 subjects 
received EU-Humira, and 131 subjects received US-Humira. The study drug was administered according 
to the protocol in all other subjects. 
Phase I study AVT02-GL-102 in healthy subjects 
A total of 204 subjects (100 in the AVT02-PFS group and 104 in the AVT02-AI group) received a single 
40  mg  s.c.  dose  of  AVT02.  One  subject  in  the  AVT02-AI  group  had  a  major  protocol  deviation  in  IP 
compliance; this subject received an incomplete dose due to a technical issue with the AI device. The 
study drug was administered according to the protocol in all other subjects. 
AI handling study AVT02-GL-303 in patients with RA 
A total of 107 patients received 40 mg AVT02-AI every other week as a single dose via s.c. injection. 
Subjects  were  exposed  to  AVT02  for  a  mean  of  56.6  days  (range  55.6  to  57.7)  with  an  average  of 
5 injections (1 investigator-led and 4 self-injections) over the course of the 8 weeks of the study. The 
mean (SD) cumulative dose administered was 198.1 (15.91) mg. Except for one patient, the complete 
volume of AVT02 was administered at every dose to every patient.

Adverse events 
Phase III study AVT02-GL-301 in patients with PsO 
Summary of adverse events 
The AE profile in the first 16 weeks of the study was similar across treatment groups (Table 20). The 
AE profile from Week 16 through Week 24 of the study was also similar across treatment groups (Table 
21). No deaths were reported in this study. Through Week 16, there were 2 subjects (1.0%) randomised 
to  AVT02  who  reported  3  TESAEs,  5  subjects  (2.4%)  randomised  to  Humira  who  reported  5  TESAEs. 
From  Week  16  through  Week  24,  there  were  4 subjects  (2.0%)  randomised  to  AVT02/AVT02  who 
reported 6 TESAEs. 
In the AVT02 treatment group, 92 subjects (44.9%) reported a total of 192 TEAEs through Week 16. 
Of these, 44 subjects (21.5%) reported 84 events that were considered as treatment related TEAEs by 
the investigator. About one-third of subjects (61/205, 29.8%) reported the TEAEs were mild in nature. 
Three  subjects  (1.5%)  had  a  TEAE  that  led  to  ET  from  the  study;  of  which  2 TEAEs  were  considered 
treatment-related  by  the  investigator;  none  were  deemed  serious.  Thirty-eight  subjects  (18.5%) 
reported 77 events that were considered TEAEs of special interest. 
In the Humira treatment group, 91 subjects (44.0%) reported a total of 245 TEAEs through Week 16. 
Of these, 41 subjects (19.8%) reported 89 events that were assessed as treatment related TEAEs by the 
investigator.  About  one-fourth  of  subjects  (51/207,  24.6%)  reported  the  TEAEs  were  mild  in  nature. 
Three  subjects  (1.4%)  reported  3  TEAEs  that  led  to  ET  from  the  study;  all  3  TEAEs  were  considered 
treatment-related by the investigator; none were deemed serious. Thirty-four subjects (16.4%) reported 
76 events that were considered TEAEs of special interest.

The AE profile from Week 16 through Week 54 of the study was similar across the AVT02/AVT02, 
Humira/AVT02, and Humira/Humira treatment groups although was slightly higher in the AVT02/AVT02 
group (116 subjects [58.9%] reported 315 events) in comparison to other groups (Humira/AVT02: 46 
subjects [47.4%] reported 153 events; Humira/Humira: 49 subjects [50.0%] reported 131 events) 
(Table 21). This difference was largely due to a slightly higher percentage of subjects in the 
AVT02/AVT02 group who reported ISRs and nasopharyngitis compared to other treatment groups. 
TEAEs reported by at least 5% of subjects in any treatment group from Week 16 through Week 54 of 
the study are presented in Table 23 
The safety profile for treatment related TEAEs was comparable between treatment groups through Week 
16 and from Week 16 through Week 54. Through Week 16, a similar percentage of subjects reported 
TEAEs that were considered treatment-related by the investigator (AVT02: 44 subjects [21.5%] reported 
84 events; Humira: 41 subjects [19.8%] reported 89 events, respectively) (Table 24). From Week 16 
through  Week  54  of  the  study,  40  subjects  [20.3%]  reported  135  events  that  were  considered  as 
treatment related TEAEs by the investigator in the AVT02/AVT02 group compared to the Humira/AVT02 
group  in  which  17  subjects  [17.5%]  reported  66 events  and  the  Humira/Humira  group  in  which  14.3 
subjects (14.3%) reported 39 events (Table 25). About one-third of subjects reported TEAEs that were

Most TEAEs in this study were not considered treatment-related (Table 20 and Table 21). ISR was the 
only treatment related TEAE reported by at least 5% subjects in any treatment group (Table 24 and 
Table 25). Regarding TEAEs reported through Week 16, the investigator attributed the ISR in 4 subjects 
(AVT02) and 2 subjects (Humira) to the injection procedure not the study drug; therefore, these TEAEs 
were not considered treatment-related by the investigator; however, the Sponsor considers all ISRs to 
be  treatment-related.  Regarding  TEAEs  reported  from  Week  16  through  Week  54,  the  investigator 
attributed  the  ISR  in  3  subjects  (AVT02/AVT02),  1  subject  (Humira/AVT02),  and  1  subject 
(Humira/Humira)  to  the  injection  procedure  not  the  study  drug;  therefore,  these  TEAEs  were  not 
considered  treatment-related  by  the  investigator;  however,  the  Sponsor  considers  all  ISRs  to  be 
treatment-related.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Through Week 16, 38 subjects (18.5%) treated with AVT02 reported 77 events and 34 subjects (16.4%) 
treated  with  Humira  reported  76  TEAEs  of  special  interest  were  considered  treatment-related  by  the 
investigator. The only TEAE of special interest reported by at least 5% in any treatment group was ISR,

which  was  reported  by  34  subjects  (16.6%)  treated  with  AVT02  reported  67  events  and  33 subjects 
(15.9%)  treated  with  Humira  reported  75  TEAEs  (Table  26).  Other  TEAEs  of  special  interest  were 
Infections  and  infestations  reported  in  0.5%  of  subjects  treated  with  AVT02  (PT:  septic  shock)  and 
Investigations  in  2.4% of  subjects  treated  with  AVT02  (PTs:  ALT  increased,  blood  bilirubin  increased, 
and  gamma-glutamyltransferase  [GGT]  increased  [0.5%  each],  and  AST  increased,  hepatic  enzyme 
increased, and transaminase increased [1.0% each]). Other TEAEs of special interest were Investigations 
reported in 0.5% subjects (PT: ALT increased) treated with Humira. 
From Week 16 through Week 24, slightly higher percentage of subjects reported TEAEs of special interest 
in the AVT02/AVT02 group compared to the Humira/AVT02 and Humira/Humira treatment groups caused 
largely by the higher number of ISRs compared to other treatment groups. 45 subjects (22.8%) treated 
with AVT02/AVT02 reported 137 events, 17 subjects (17.5%) treated with Humira/AVT02 reported 64 
TEAEs, and 13 subjects (13.3%) treated with Humira/Humira reported 37 TEAEs (Table 27). The only 
TEAE of special interest reported by at least 5% in any treatment group was ISR, which was reported by 
31 subjects (15.7%) treated with AVT02/AVT02 who reported 120 events, 10 subjects (10.3%) treated 
with Humira/AVT02 reported 54 events, and 10 subjects (10.2%) treated with Humira/Humira reported 
34 TEAEs. Other TEAEs of special interest reported in 3.0% subjects treated with AVT02/AVT02 were 
Investigations (PT: ALT increased [0.5%] and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex test positive [4.6%]), 
in subjects treated with Humira/AVT02 were Blood and lymphatic disorders, 1.0% (PT: leukopenia 1.0%) 
and  Investigations,  4.1%  (PTs:  ALT  increased  [3.1%],  AST  increased  [1.0%],  and  Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis  complex  test  positive  [1.0%]),  and  in  subjects  treated  with  Humira/Humira  were 
Investigations, 1.0% (PTs: Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex test positive [1.0%]). 
The only TEAE of special interest reported by >5%  of subjects considered treatment-related was ISR 
(Table 22 and Table 23). For those subjects with liver enzyme abnormalities, most had pre-existing 
conditions (e.g., obesity, fatty liver disease, increased cholesterolemia, and/or diabetes mellitus) which 
predisposed them to the possibility of such abnormalities.

Injection site reactions 
ISR reported as TEAEs were similar across treatment groups through Week 16 (Table 28). All ISRs were 
mild in severity. From Week 16 through Week 54 of the study, there was a higher occurrence of ISRs in 
the AVT02/AVT02 group compared to the Humira/AVT02 and Humira/Humira treatment groups with a 
similar profile of ISR terms reported on the AE form between groups that was not clinically significant 
(Table 29). All ISRs were mild in nature except for 1 event of moderate severity reported by 1 subject 
in the AVT02/AVT02 group. 
Generally,  a  similar  profile  of  ISR  terms  were  reported  by  a  similar  percentage  of  subjects  across

TEAEs based on presence of psoriatic arthritis 
In the subset of subjects with psoriatic arthritis, the incidence of TEAEs was similar through Week 16 
and from Week 16 through Week 54. The severity of TEAEs was similar across the treatment groups with 
about one-third of subjects reporting TEAEs which were mild in nature through Week 16 and 1 subject 
reporting 2 severe TEAEs (AVT02/AVT02; from Week 16 through Week 54). 
Phase I study AVT02-GL-101 in healthy subjects 
Overall,  the  safety  profiles  of  AVT02,  EU-Humira,  and  US-Humira  were  similar.  80.0%  of  subjects 
reported at least 1 TEAE during the study; the subject frequency of TEAEs was similar across treatment

groups.  At  least  1  treatment  related  TEAE  was  reported  by  34.6%  of  subjects  overall.  Slightly  more 
subjects  in  the  AVT02  (34.6%)  and  EU-Humira  (38.0%)  groups  reported  at  least  1 related  TEAE 
compared with the US-Humira group (31.3%). The majority of subjects experienced TEAEs that were 
mild in severity (75.9%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  AESIs  across  the  3  treatment  groups  were  local  administration  site 
reactions. At least 1 local administration site reaction AESI was reported by 12.6% of subjects overall; 
the subject frequency of these events was comparable across treatment groups: 13.8% in the AVT02 
group, 10.9% in the EU-Humira group, and 13.0% in the US-Humira group. The most frequently reported 
local administration site reaction AESI was injection site erythema (9.0% overall). The subject frequency 
of these events was higher in the AVT02 group (12.3%) compared with the EU-Humira (7.8%) and US-
Humira (6.9%) groups. The majority of reported local administration site reaction AESIs were mild in 
severity (11.0% of subjects overall). 
Phase I study AVT02-GL-102 in healthy subjects 
Overall, the safety profiles of AVT02-PFS and AVT02-AI were similar. 84.8% of subjects reported at least 
1 TEAE during the study; the frequency of TEAEs was similar between treatment groups. The majority 
of subjects experienced TEAEs that were mild in severity (82.8%). 
At  least  1  AESI  was  reported  by  15.7%  of  subjects  overall;  the  frequency  of  AESIs  was  comparable 
between treatment groups. The most frequently reported AESIs in both groups were local administration 
site reactions. The most frequently reported local administration site reaction was injection site erythema 
(9 subjects in the AVT02-PFS group and 12 subjects in the AVT02-AI group). 
AI handling study AVT02-GL-303 in patients with RA 
Twenty-three TEAEs were reported by 19 subjects (17.8%); 3 subjects (2.8%) each reported a treatment 
related TEAE; and 1 subject (0.9%) reported a TEAE of special interest (leukopenia) through Week 8 of 
the study. Through Week 8, the only TEAE reported by at least 2% of subjects were influenza (4.7%) 
and  headache  (2.8%.  There  were  68  reports  of  TEAE  as  of  treatment  Week  9  to  the  data  extraction 
point. This included 5 AESIs and 3 TESAEs since treatment Week 9, which were either judged as not 
treatment-related  or  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  Humira.  The  majority  of  TEAEs 
were mild. 
Pilot study AVT02-GL-100 in healthy subjects 
Treatment-emergent AEs were experienced by 11 (91.7%) subjects in the AVT02 group compared with 
10 (83.3%) in the EU-Humira group. The most frequently reported SOCs were infections and infestations 
(7 [58.3%] subjects in AVT02 group and 6 [50%] subjects in EU-Humira group) and nervous system 
disorders  (4  [33.3%]  subjects  in  each  group).  The  most  common  TEAEs  at  the  PT  level  were  upper 
respiratory  infection  and  headache.  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection  was  experienced  by  5 (41.7%) 
subjects in the AVT02 group and 6 (50%) subjects in the EU-Humira group. Headache was experienced 
by 4 (33.3%) subjects in each group. No severe TEAEs were reported. 
Study AVT02-GL-302 in patients with PsO 
Of the 568 enrolled subjects, 536 were on treatment, and 35 had terminated the study early until the 
data extraction point, all of whom were being treated with Humira. There were 420 reports of TEAEs as 
of the data extraction point. Of those, 80 were AESIs comprising 70 ISRs, 2 liver enzyme elevations, 
4 serious  infections,  1  hypersensitivity  reaction,  2  haematological  disorders,  and  1  malignancy.  The 
majority  of  events  were  of  mild  severity  (n  =  311),  with  100  events  rated  as  moderate,  5  rated  as 
severe, and 4 unclassified as of data extraction point. There were 6 serious TEAEs, all of  which were 
judged to be not treatment-related (see Section 4.1.1). One was fatal (not treatment-related, because 
of carbon monoxide poisoning), 2 led to early discontinuation (COVID-19 infection, cancer of pancreas) 
Assessment report

and 3 allowed continuation of the study (COVID-19 infection, pneumonia related to COVID-19 infection, 
and ulcer). In summary, the adverse events reported were consistent with the known safety profile of 
Humira. No new safety signals were identified. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Phase III study AVT02-GL-301 in patients with PsO 
No deaths were reported in this study. 
Through Week 16 serious TEAEs have been reported more frequently in Humira group (5 subjects [2.4%] 
reported 5 serious TEAEs) than in AVT02 group (2 subjects [1.0%] reported 3 serious TEAEs). No TESAE 
was reported in more than 1 subject in either treatment group. The TESAEs considered treatment-related 
by the sponsor were large intestinal polyp and salpingo-oophoritis in Humira group, and duodenal ulcer 
haemorrhage and septic shock + urosepsis in AVT02 group.  
From Week 16 through Week 54 of the study, TESAEs were only reported by subjects in the AVT02/AVT02 
treatment  group.  No  TESAE  was  reported  by  more  than  1  subject.  Only  1  TESAE  (meningitis 
meningococcal)  was  considered  treatment-related  by  the  investigator  and  sponsor.  In  addition,  one 
report of pulmonary embolism was considered treatment-related by the sponsor. 
All serious TEAEs reported during the study have been resolved. The narratives of all serious TEAEs have 
been provided. The applicant listed all serious TEAEs by primary SOC and PT, by relation to the study 
drug  and  by  severity,  in  line  with  to  the  study  protocol.  However,  the  AEs  have  not  been  classified 
according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, which would have been more informative. 
One subject diagnosed with large intestinal polyp (in AVT02 group) was discontinued from the study at 
Week 16 as the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index criteria was not met. In addition, one subject diagnosed 
with salpingo-oophoritis (in Humira group) was discontinued from the study due to adnexa-uteri mass, 
which was considered unlikely to be related to Humira. 
According to the applicant, no serious TEAEs reported in study AVT02-GL-301 led to early termination of 
the study. 
Phase I Study AVT02-GL-101 in healthy subjects 
No deaths or other serious TEAEs were reported in this study. 
Phase I study AVT02-GL-102 in healthy subjects 
No deaths were reported in this study. Three subjects (1.5% overall, 2 in AVT02-PFS group and 1 in the 
AVT02-AI group) reported a total of 4 SAEs during the study. 
AI handling study AVT02-GL-303 in patients with RA 
No  deaths  or  other  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  during  the  first  8  weeks.  Three  serious  TEAEs  were 
reported  from  Week  9  to  the  data  extraction  point  of  the  applicant’s  safety  update  report:  one  (liver 
enzyme elevation) was judged to be treatment-related and the two other not treatment-related.

One subject in Humira group had a positive QuantiFERON TB Gold Test at Screening but was randomised 
and  received  3  injections  (2  injections  on  Day  1  and  1  injection  at  Week  2);  this  subject  was  then 
discontinued  from  the  study  based  on  the  Medical  Monitor’s  decision.  This  was  considered  a  critical 
protocol deviation. Eight subjects randomised to AVT02/AVT02 (3702025, 3808015, 3808024, 3808035, 
4807001,  4808063,  9901006,  and  9901016),  3  subjects  randomised  to  Humira/AVT02  (3808019, 
4802022,  and  9904021),  and  3  subjects  randomised  to  Humira/Humira  (3808005,  9904007,  and 
9904022) reported positive QuantiFERON TB Gold Tests through Week 54. All of those with positive tests 
were  referred  to  a  pulmonologist  for  further  follow-up.  Additionally,  2  subjects  randomised  to 
AVT02/AVT02 (9904008 and 9904018) reported a positive TB test as an AE where the associated test 
result data is missing or indeterminate. Subsequent chest X-rays were negative, and no TB lesion was 
concluded. 
The percentage of subjects with a positive QuantiFERON TB Gold test result remained at <3.2% in all 
test groups throughout the study, except those subjects that terminated the study early. In patients that 
terminated the study early, patients with positive QuantiFERON TB Gold test result among the respective 
groups (AVT02, Humira, AVT02/AVT02, Humira/AVT02, Humira/Humira) were: 0 of 5 (0%), 0 of 7 (0%), 
5 of 12 (41.7%), 2 of 5 (40.0%), and 1 of 7 (14.3%). 
Laboratory values over time 
No differences were observed between treatment groups in hematology, chemistry or urinalysis values 
during the study. 
Most subjects had either a normal or CTCAE Grade 1 as the highest post-BL LFT result. An equal number 
of subjects in each treatment group had either a normal or CTCAE Grade 1 BL LFT result which became 
either a CTCAE Grade 2 or higher post-BL through Week 16. Ten of 197 subjects (%) randomised to 
AVT02 and 9 of 98 subjects (%) randomised to Humira reported a CTCAE Grade 2 or higher CK results 
post-BL. 
Individual subject changes 
No differences were observed in shifts between treatment groups in hematology, chemistry or urinalysis 
values during the study. 
Studies AVT02-GL-101, AVT02-GL-102 and AVT02-GL-303 
In the single-dose studies AVT02-GL-101 and AVT02-GL-102, results on the distributions of chemistry 
and  hematology  of  healthy  subjects  were  similar  in  AVT02,  EU-Humira  and  US-Humira,  as  well  as  in 
AVT02-PFS  and  AVT02-AI  treatment  groups.  No  differences  were  observed  between  the  treatment 
groups through the end of these studies. 
In study AVT02-GL-303 in patients with RA, no unexpected changes in laboratory values were reported 
during the first phase of study through Week 8. 
Vital Signs, Physical Examination Findings and Other Observations Related to 
Safety 
Phase III study AVT02-GL-301 in patients with PsO 
No differences were observed in vital signs, physical examinations and ECG findings during the study 
through Week 16 or Week 54. Across all treatment groups, most assessments had a mean change from 
baseline that was similar. 
No differences were seen in physical examinations through Week 16 or Week 54.

normal  or  abnormal  not  clinically  significant.  Most  assessments  remained  as  they  were  assessed  at 
Screening through Week 54; there were minimal changes. 
Studies AVT02-GL-101, AVT02-GL-102 and AVT02-GL-303 
In the single-dose studies AVT02-GL-101 and AVT02-GL-102, similar results on the vital signs, physical 
examinations and ECG findings of healthy subjects were observed in AVT02, EU-Humira and US-Humira, 
as well as in AVT02-PFS and AVT02-AI treatment groups through the end of these studies. 
In the study AVT02-GL-303, AVT02 produced no changes in vital signs or ECG and no new differences 
in physical examinations were observed in patients with RA during the first phase of study through Week 
8. Consistent with the RA, the X-ray of the hands/bone/wrists at baseline were almost all abnormal.

Immunological events 
The immunogenic potential of AVT02 was analysed in healthy subjects after a single s.c. administration 
(studies AVT02-GL-101 and AVT02-GL-102) and in patients with moderate-to-severe PsO after multiple 
administration (study AVT02-GL-301). In addition, the applicant plans to submit immunogenicity data 
from  the  ongoing  usability  study  AVT02-GL-303.  Immunogenicity  results  from  the  pilot  study  with  a 
qualitatively non-representative drug product (study AVT02-GL-100) are also briefly presented. 
The drug tolerance of the ADA assay was reported to be at least 1000 ng/mL ADA detected at 62.5 μg/mL 
of AVT02 or at 61.89 μg/mL of Humira and at least 21 ng/mL ADA detected at 3.13 μg/mL of AVT02 or 
at 6.25 μg/mL of Humira. 
NAb concentrations of at least 100 ng/ml were detected in the presence of 6 μg/ml AVT02. 
Immunogenicity Results in patients with PsO (Study AVT02-GL-301) 
Frequency of ADA and NAb 
In Study AVT02-GL-301 the serum samples for the immunogenicity assessment (ADA and NAb) were 
collected at Week 1/Day 1 (predose), and predose at Weeks 4, 8, 16,24, 32 and 50 and on the follow-
up visit at week 54. 
Most subjects were ADA positive through Week 16 (AVT02: 88.8%; Humira: 90.8%) and through Week 
54 (AVT02/AVT02: 93.4%; AVT02/Humira: 91.8%; Humira/Humira: 95.9%). Of these, most subjects 
were also positive for NAbs through Week 16 (AVT02: 66.3%; Humira: 73.4%) and through Week 54 
(AVT02/AVT02: 84.3%; AVT02/Humira: 83.5%; Humira/Humira: 80.6%) (Table 30 and Table 31).

ADA titres 
Descriptive statistics of ADA titres were presented by visit for all treatment arms from baseline to week 
54 in Appendix tables to the CSR, Overall, ADA titers were similar between the treatment groups through 
Week  16,  from  Week  24  through  Week  54,  (compared  with  BL),  and  from  BL  through  Week  54  (for 
subjects who were treated with the same drug, AVT02 or Humira) as indicated in Figure 10 and Figure 
11. The geometric means increased with the duration of the treatment and were comparable between 
the treatment groups, with maximal levels at Week 24.

Impact of ADA on PK 
In  the  clinical  study  in  PsO  patients  (AVT02-GL-301)  mean  serum  trough  levels  of  both  AVT02  and 
EU-Humira were higher in those subjects that were ADA negative and lower in those subjects that were 
NAb positive (Tables 32 and 33). 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 91/122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Trough concentrations were comparable at steady-state between those subjects who were randomised 
to AVT02 and Humira or AVT02/AVT02 and Humira/Humira. There was no meaningful difference in the 
adalimumab  serum  trough  concentrations  when  comparing  subjects  treated  with  AVT02  or  Humira  in 
subgroups without ADAs, with ADA, or with NAbs throughout the study period. 
Of note, only overall post-dose ADA status was used in the tables below and not the actual visit-based 
ADA status, which makes it difficult to interpret results regarding impact of ADA status on PK.

Impact of ADA on efficacy 
In ADA positive subjects, the mean percent improvement in PASI at week 16 was 90.8% vs 90.5%, in 
subjects randomised to AVT02 and Humira respectively. In ADA negative subjects, improvement in PASI 
was greater in the AVT02 group: 98.2% vs 81.5%, respectively (FAS, LOCF) (Table 34).

Percent improvement from baseline in PASI was comparable between AVT02 and Humira in both ADA 
positive  and  ADA  negative  subjects  at  all  time  points  up  to  week  50  and  also  among  patients  who 
switched  from  Humira  to  AVT02.    The  slightly  lower  mean  PASI  improvement  observed  in  the  LOCF 
analyses, but not in the PPS, for ADA-negative subjects in the Humira treatment arm, could be explained 
by the impact of missing data on the small subject population and is not considered clinically meaningful. 
Impact of ADA on safety 
TEAES by Anti-drug Antibody Status 
In Stage 1 of the study, through Week 16, a similar percentage of ADA positive subjects reported TEAEs 
in both treatment groups. Less ADA negative subjects reported TEAEs in the Humira group (18 subjects, 
48.6%) than in the AVT02 group (11 subjects, 35.5%). However, this difference was not considered to 
be  clinically  significant,  considering  the  low  subject  numbers.  Severe  TEAEs  were  only  reported  in 
subjects  with  ADA  positive  status  in  both  treatment  groups.  There  were  no  other  notable  clinically 
significant  differences  between  groups.  Through  Week  16,  74  ADA  positive  subjects  (44.0%)  treated 
with AVT02, 18 ADA negative subjects (48.6%) treated with AVT02; 80 ADA positive subjects (45.5%) 
treated with Humira, and 11 ADA negative subjects (35.5%) treated with Humira reported TEAEs. TEAEs 
reported in ADA negative patients at frequencies ≥5% were the following (AVT02 vs Humira treatment 
group,  respectively):  injection  site  reaction  (16.2%,  19.4%),  nasopharyngitis  (8.1%,  0%),  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection  (5.4%,  0%),  pyrexia  (0%,  6.5%)  and  tinea  versicolor  (5.4%,  0%).  The 
differences  in  TEAEs  reported  in  at  least  5%  of  subjects  in  any  treatment  group  between  treatment 
groups was small, not considered related to ADA status, and not clinically significant. 
Through Week 16, a similar percentage of treatment induced ADA subjects reported treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) in both treatment groups. Less pre-existing ADA subjects reported TEAEs in the 
AVT02  group  than  in  the  Humira  group.  However,  this  difference  was  not  considered  to  be  clinically 
significant,  considering  the  low  subject  numbers.  Similar  percentage  of  TEAEs  were  reported  for  pre-
existing and treatment induced subjects within each treatment group. Severe TEAEs were only reported 
in subjects with treatment induced ADA status in both treatment groups. There were no other notable 
clinically significant differences between subjects with pre-existing and treatment induced groups. 
From Week 16 through Week 54 of the study, a similar percentage of ADA positive subjects reported 
TEAEs  across  treatment  groups.  More  ADA  negative  subjects  reported  TEAEs  in  the  AVT02/AVT02 
(18 subjects, 69.2%) group than in Humira/Humira (4 subjects, 28.6%) and Humira/AVT02 (8 subjects, 
50.0%) groups. However, this difference was not considered clinically significant, considering the low 
subject  numbers.  Severe  TEAEs  were  only  reported  in  subjects  with  ADA  positive  status  in  the 
AVT02/AVT02 group. TEAEs reported in ADA negative patients at frequencies ≥5% and more often in 
more than one patient in groups receiving AVT02 were the following (AVT02/AVT02, Humira/AVT02, and 
Humira/Humira  treatment  group,  respectively):  injection  site  reaction  (30.8%,  12.5%,  0%), 
nasopharyngitis (23.1%, 12.5%, 7.1%), and oral herpes (7.7%, 0%, 0%). The difference in ISRs and 
nasopharyngitis was not considered related to the ADA status, and not clinically significant.

From Week 16 through Week 54 of the study, a similar percentage of treatment induced ADA subjects 
reported TEAEs in Humira/AVT02 and Humira/Humira groups and was slightly higher in AVT02/AVT02 
group.  Less  pre-existing  ADA  subjects  reported  TEAEs  in  the  Humira/Humira  group  than  in  the 
AVT02/AVT02  and  Humira/AVT02  groups.  However,  this  difference  was  not  considered  clinically 
significant,  considering  the  low  subject  numbers.  Severe  TEAEs  were  only  reported  in  subjects  with 
treatment  induced  ADA  status  in  the  AVT02/AVT02  group.  There  were  no  other  notable  clinically 
significant  differences  between  subjects  with  pre-existing  and  treatment  induced  groups  through  the 
study. 
Through  Week  16  and  through  the  study,  differences  in  TEAEs  were  less  than  5%  of  subjects  in  any 
treatment  group  by  PT  between  treatment  groups,  for  both  pre-existing  and  treatment  induced  ADA 
subjects. The applicant concludes that based on presented results, the safety profile for subjects with 
pre-existing  ADA  and  subjects  with  treatment  induced  ADA  was  similar  between  treatment  groups 
through Week 16 and through the study. 
Through  Week  16  and  through  the  study,  differences  in  TEAEs  were  less  than  5%  of  subjects  in  any

TEAES by Neutralizing Anti-drug Antibody Status 
A similar percentage of subjects reported TEAEs across treatment groups (39.7-45.6%) regardless of 
NAb status through Week 16 except slightly more NAb negative subjects reported TEAEs (47.2%) and 
those that were mild in nature (32.4%) in the AVT02 group. Through Week 16, 25 NAb positive subjects 
(39.7%) treated with AVT02, 67 NAb negative subjects (47.2%) treated with AVT02; 34 NAb positive 
subjects  (41.5%)  treated  with  Humira,  and  57  NAb  negative  subjects  (45.6%)  treated  with  Humira 
reported  TEAEs.  TEAEs  reported  in  NAb  positive  patients  at  frequencies  ≥5%  were  the  following  (in 
AVT02  vs  Humira  treatment  groups,  respectively):  injection  site  reaction  (15.9%,  12.2%)  and 
nasopharyngitis (1.6%, 7.3%). TEAEs reported in NAb negative patients at frequencies ≥5% were the 
following (AVT02 vs Humira treatment group, respectively): injection site reaction (16.9%, 18.4%) and 
nasopharyngitis (7.0%, 4.0%). 
From Week 16 through Week 54 of the study, a similar percentage of NAb positive subjects reported 
TEAEs across treatment groups. In NAb negative subjects, the percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs 
was lower in the Humira/Humira group (65.6 %, 50.0% and 30.0% in AVT02/AVT02, Humira/AVT02 and 
Humira/Humira groups, respectively). However, this difference was not considered clinically significant, 
considering the low subject numbers (21, 9 and 6 NAb negative subjects in AVT02/AVT02, Humira/AVT02 
and Humira/Humira groups, respectively). TEAEs reported in NAb negative patients at frequencies ≥5% 
and more often in more than one patient in groups receiving AVT02 were the following (AVT02/AVT02, 
Humira/AVT02,  and  Humira/Humira  treatment  group,  respectively):  injection  site  reaction  (31.3%, 
11.1%,  0%),  nasopharyngitis  (18.8%,  11.1%,  5.0%),  oral  herpes  (6.3%,  0%,  0%),  and  dermatitis 
contact (6.3%, 0%, 5.0%). 
Immunogenicity Results in healthy volunteers  
The  clinical  studies  in  healthy  subjects  (i.e.  clinical  studies  AVT02-GL-101,  AVT02-GL-102  and 
[AVT02-GL-100])  are  described  in  detail  in  Chapter  2.1.3.  The  clinical  studies  in  patients  (i.e.  clinical 
studies AVT02-GL-301 and AVT02-GL-303) are described in detail in Chapter 3.3. Here, only the most 
important results related to the PK and immunogenicity are presented. 
Study AVT02-GL-101 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 95/122 
 
 
 
Study  AVT02-GL-101  was  designed  to  compare  the  PK  of  AVT02  with  EU-Humira  and  US-Humira, 
following a single 40 mg SC injection in healthy adult volunteers. For safety and immunogenicity analyses 
a total of 390 subjects, randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio, were analysed.  
The  serum  samples  for  the  immunogenicity  assessment  (ADA  and  NAb)  were  collected  at  Day  1 
(predose), and D9, D15, D29 and D64 post dose.  
At baseline, the frequency of subjects who were positive for binding ADAs was 6.2% in the AVT02 group, 
3.9%  in  the  EU-Humira  group  and  5.3%  in  the  US-Humira  group.  The  incidence  of  ADA-positivity 
progressively increased over the duration of the study, with ADAs observed in >95% of subjects at Day 
64 (Table 35). 
At Day 64, the median ADA titer was 128 in both the AVT02 and EU-Humira groups Table 36. 
Table 35 Summary of Antidrug Antibody frequency in healthy volunteers (Study AVT02-GL-101) 
ADA = antidrug antibody; NAb = neutralizing  antibody; EOS = End-of-study. 
Notes:  The  NAb  assay  was  only  performed  for samples positive for ADAs, except for 1 subject in the AVT02 group 
(Day  9  sample)  and  1  subject  in  the  EU-Humira  group  (EOS  sample),  whose  ADA  results were negative and NAb 
was performed (with negative NAb results). 
Early termination samples were excluded from the data summary. 
The  denominator  for  the  percent  frequency  of  NAb  detection  is  the  total  number of NAb results for the respective 
treatment and study day.

Table 36 Summary of Antidrug Antibody Titers in healthy volunteers (Study AVT02-GL-101) 
The applicant states that due to the high frequency of ADA and NAb formation, relationships between 
immunogenicity and PK parameters could not be elucidated. 
It is acknowledged that formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and NAb had a high frequency in study 
AVT02-GL-101 after a single-dose administration of 40 mg s.c. of either AVT02, EU-Humira or US-Humira. 
However,  it  is  well  known  that  development  of  antibodies  causes  increased  clearance,  lower  drug 
concentrations and subsequent decreased exposure of adalimumab. Presence of NAb can affect the PK 
profile of adalimumab, especially the elimination phase. Thus, the applicant was asked to present box 
and whisker of plots of AUC0-t (h·ng/mL), AUC0-inf (h·ng/mL), Cmax (ng/mL) by Treatment and NAb Status 
(Day 1-64) – Pharmacokinetic population.  In the response, the applicant provided the asked data and 
it could be seen that presence of Nab affects adalimumab PK profile especially in the elimination phase 
of adalimumab. The impact of NAb presence on the PK parameters Cmax is minor or negligible. The impact 
of NAb presence on the PK parameters AUC0-t and AUC0-inf is considerable. Comparisons of AVT02 vs EU-
Humira  vs  US-Humira  within  the  NAb  positive  and  NAb  negative  subgroups  showed  no  relevant 
differences between treatment groups. 
Study AVT02-GL-102 
At baseline (i.e. predose on Day 1), the frequency of subjects who were positive for binding ADAs were 
similar  in  the  AVT02-PFS  (12.0%)  and  AVT02-AI  (15.4%)  groups.  Formation  of  ADAs  progressively 
increased over the duration of the study, with a positive detection of binding ADAs observed in 100% 
(98 of 98) of subjects in the AVT02-PFS group and 97.0% (96 of 99) of subjects in the AVT02-AI group 
at Day 64 (i.e., EOS sample). 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 97/122 
 
 
 
 
The frequency of subjects who tested positive for NAbs also increased over the duration of the study, at 
Day 64 85.7% of subjects in the AVT02-PFS group and 86.5% in the AVT02-AI group were NAb positive.  
ADA titers increased from Day 1 to Day 64/EOS in both groups AVT02-AI and AVT02-PFS. Whereas the 
mean values of antidrug antibody titers were slightly higher in AVT02-PFS than in AVT02-AI, the median 
values were the same at Day 1, 9, 29 and 64/EOS. In addition, the maximum ADA titers were equal in 
both groups at Day 15, 29 and 64/EOS. 
Due  to  the  high  frequency  of  ADA  and  NAb  formation,  relationships  between  immunogenicity  and  PK 
parameters  could  not  be  elucidated.  See  the  comments  regarding  the  impact  of  ADA  on  the  PK 
parameters for study AVT02-GL-101. However, because the study was not a comparative study between 
AVT02 and EU-Humira, the issue is not further pursued.

2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 1,006 subjects were treated with AVT02 or Humira in one Phase III clinical study in patients 
with PsO, and in two Phase I single-dose studies in healthy subjects. Safety findings are reported for 
594 healthy subjects and 412 PsO patients. 
The applicant’s clinical development programme included one pivotal Phase III confirmatory efficacy and 
safety study AVT02-GL-301 in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. For details on the study 
population, see section 3.3 of this AR. From the safety point of view, the objective of this study was to 
evaluate overall safety, including immunogenicity over 54 weeks. Duration of the study AVT02-GL-301 
is considered long enough for safety assessment. However, data up to week 24 only was included in the 
applicant’s initial submission. In order to enable full assessment of safety and biosimilarity, the pending 
long-term safety data up to 54 weeks was asked to be provided. The completed clinical study report with 
data up to week 54 was then submitted as response and has been assessed. 
In addition to the pivotal biosimilarity study, safety data is also available from two Phase I single-dose 
studies in healthy volunteers: study AVT02-GL-101 (PK study for biosimilarity) and Study AVT02-GL-102 
(PK study comparing AI and PFS). These studies have been completed and their final results are available 
at the time of this assessment. Overall, the safety results from these studies are considered supportive.

In the Phase III study AVT02-GL-301 in PsO patients, TEAEs were reported in 92 (44.9%) patients in 
the AVT02 treatment group and in 91 (44.0%) patients in the EU-Humira treatment group during Stage 
1  through  Week  16.  The  frequency  of  TEAEs  was  similar  between  treatment  groups.  The  only  TEAEs 
reported by more than 5% of subjects in any treatment group were injection site reaction (16.6% in 
AVT02  group,  15.9%  in  Humira  group)  and  nasopharyngitis  (5.4%  in  AVT02  group,  5.3%  in  Humira 
group). 
During  Stage  2  of  the  study  AVT02-GL-301  from  Week  16  through  Week  54,  58.9%  of  subjects  on 
AVT02/AVT02,  47.4%  of  subjects  on  Humira/AVT02,  and  50.0%  of  subjects  on  Humira/Humira, 
respectively, reported at least 1 TEAE. This difference between groups was largely due to a slightly higher 
percentage of subjects in the AVT02/AVT02 group who reported ISRs and nasopharyngitis compared to 
other treatment groups. The only TEAEs reported by more than 5% of subjects in any treatment group 
and more often in groups that received AVT02 were injection site reaction and nasopharyngitis. 15.7% 
of  subjects  on  AVT02/AVT02,  11.3%  of  subjects  on  Humira/AVT02,  and  10.3%  of  subjects  on 
Humira/Humira reported injection site reactions. Nasopharyngitis were reported by 11.7% of subjects 
on AVT02/AVT02, 5.2% of subjects on Humira/AVT02, and 4.1% of subjects on Humira/Humira. 
Adverse events of special interest were reported by similar percentage of patients in AVT02 and Humira 
treatment groups during study AVT02-GL-301. From Week 16 through Week 54 of the study, a slightly 
higher  percentage  of  subjects  reported  TEAEs  of  special  interest  in  the  AVT02/AVT02  group  (22.8%) 
compared to the Humira/AVT02 (17.5%) and Humira/Humira (13.3%) treatment groups caused largely 
by the higher number of ISRs compared to other treatment groups. No clinically significant differences 
are seen between treatment groups with regard to TEAEs of special interest. 
A discrepancy was identified between different documents regarding the number of psoriasis events by 
treatment arms reported in study AVT02-GL-301, which lead to study drug discontinuation. Thus, the 
applicant  was  requested  to  clarify  this  discrepancy  and  correct  accordingly  the  information.  In  the 
response, the applicant clarified the noted discrepancy and provided the narrative for the 4th psoriasis 
(worsening) event occurred in one subject treated with AVT02, which lead to study drug discontinuation. 
The issue was resolved. 
Another  discrepancy  was  identified  between  different  documents  regarding  the  number  events  of 
Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  complex  test  positive  in  AVT02/AVT02.  The  applicant  clarified  these 
discrepancies; the narrative for subject 4808063 with positive QuantiFERON Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
complex (TB+) test event was included in the Final CSR. Narratives for subjects 9904008 and 9904018 
as  well  as  Listing  16.2.8.4  QuantiFERON-TB  Gold  Test  of  the  CSR  were  corrected  to  reflect  the  TB 
indeterminate status at Week 24. For subject 9904008 at EOS Visit the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test was 
negative. For subject 9904018 the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test was repeated, and the results was the 
same,  indeterminate.  In  addition,  Chest  X-ray  were  performed,  and  no  signs  of  tuberculosis  were 
detected. The issue was resolved. 
In addition, there was a concern regarding the causality assessment of events of Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis complex test positive reported in AVT02-GL-301, which lead to study drug discontinuation. 
As all these are TEAEs of special interest, the applicant was asked to clarify this. In the response, the 
applicant  justified  that  the  causality  assessment  was  performed  by  each  of  the  Investigators 
independently based on their best medical knowledge, evaluation of the nature and case of each event, 
the  main  non-drug  causes  of  the  reported  events,  but  taking  into  account  also  the  prevalence  of 
tuberculosis that is high in some countries in which Study AVT02-GL-301 was conducted. Some of the 
narratives were updated in the Final CSR. The causality assessment performed by the Investigator was 
changed in respect to the number of events of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex test positive reported 
which  led  to  study  drug  discontinuation.  In  summary,  the  final  conclusion  was  that  the  3 events  in 
AVT02/AVT02  group,  2  events  in  Humira/AVT02  group  and  one  event  in  Humira/Humira  group  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 101/122 
 
 
 
reported as treatment-related by the Investigator. Based on the applicant’s response, this issue is not 
further pursued. 
From Week 16 through Week 54, serious TEAEs were reported in the AVT02/AVT02 group only. Of these, 
one  (meningitis  meningococcal)  was  considered  related  to  the  study  drug  by  the  investigator  and 
sponsor, and one (pulmonary embolism) by the sponsor only. No serious TEAEs were reported by more 
than subject or led to early termination during the study AVT02-GL-301. 
In the subset of patients with psoriatic arthritis, the incidence of TEAEs was comparable in study AVT02-
GL-301. 
Taken  together,  the  number  and  pattern  of  TEAEs  and  proportion  of  patients  reporting  them  were  in 
general comparable in AVT02 and Humira groups in the pivotal safety study AVT02-GL-301. The adverse 
event profile in study AVT02-GL-301 appears in line with expectations from historical data for Humira 
and its previously approved biosimilars. 
The number and pattern of adverse events in the single-dose studies AVT02-GL-101 and AVT02-GL-102 
appear supportive of the preliminary conclusions based on the safety data currently available from the 
pivotal safety study AVT02-GL-301. 
No  notable  differences  or  trends  in  laboratory  parameters  or  marked  differences  in  vital  sign 
measurements,  ECG,  physical  examination  results,  tuberculosis  assessment  or  in  local  site  pain 
assessment between treatment groups were seen in studies AVT02-GL-301, AVT02-GL-101 and AVT02-
GL-102. 
Discussion on immunogenicity 
The immunogenic potential of AVT02 was analysed in healthy subjects after a single s.c. administration 
(studies AVT02-GL-101 and AVT02-GL-102) and in patients with moderate-to-severe PsO after multiple 
administrations (study AVT02-GL-301). 
The sampling time points, and study designs were suitable for adequate immunogenicity detection in all 
studies.  The drug tolerance of the ADA assay was sufficient to analyse 96% of the samples correctly 
and  the  differences  in  drug  tolerance  between  Libmyris  and  Humira  was  shown  to  be  negligible. 
Therefore,  potentially  undetected  ADAs  among  patients  with  drug  concentrations  above  the  drug 
tolerance level of the ADA assay are not abundant and are not expected to affect conclusions regarding 
similarity between the products. 
In the pivotal study on therapeutic equivalence in PsO patients (AVT02-GL-301), most subjects in both 
treatment arms (up to 96%) were positive for ADAs over the presented 54-week period. No clinically 
significant difference in ADA incidence between AVT02 and Humira was apparent by week 16. Throughout 
the study, the timing of ADA formation and the ADA titers were similar between the treatment groups. 
The  geometric  means  increase  with  the  duration of  the  treatment  and  were  comparable  between  the 
treatment groups, with maximal levels at Week 24.  
A high proportion of patients were ADA positive at baseline; 20.5% and 18.8% in the AVT02 and Humira 
arms respectively. High baseline frequencies of ADA were also found among healthy volunteers in Study 
AVT02-GL-101  (6.2%  in  the  AVT02  group,  3.9%  in  the  EU-Humira  group)  and  Study  AVT02-GL-102 
(12%  in  the  PFS  arm  and  15.4%  in  the  AI  arm).  This  finding  is  confusing,  considering  that  healthy 
volunteers should have no prior exposure to TNF-alfa inhibitors and that any use of prior or concomitant 
or biosimilar adalimumab therapy, either approved or investigational, was an exclusion criterion in all 
studies.  After  the  responses  to  LoQ,  the  ADA-method  is  considered  acceptable.  The  reasons  for  high 
frequency of pre-dose concentrations remain unclear. However, the frequency of pre-existing ADAs was 
similar in both groups. In addition, the applicant demonstrated that no meaningful difference in efficacy 
or safety was seen between treatment groups in subjects with pre-existing or treatment induced ADA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 102/122 
 
 
 
Moreover, the overall frequency of subjects with detected ADA despite no previous use of adalimumab 
is comparable to that observed in other clinical studies with Humira biosimilars. Hence, this issue is not 
pursued further. 
There  was  a  somewhat  lower  incidence  of  NAb  with  AVT02  compared  to  Humira  by  week  16  (total 
cumulative incidence by week 16: 66.3% and 73.4% for AVT02 and Humira respectively). According to 
the  EMA  Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  monoclonal  antibodies,  a  lower 
immunogenicity for the biosimilar does not preclude biosimilarity. Therefore, the difference in detected 
NAbs is acceptable, as no meaningful difference in safety or efficacy was detected. 
A  trend  for  lower  drug  concentrations  was  seen  in  the  Humira  group,  especially  among  NAb  positive 
subjects. The results are difficult to interpret since only overall post-dose ADA status was used and not 
the actual visit-based ADA/NAb status. The applicant was asked to re-analyse the impact of ADA and 
NAb status on the serum trough concentrations using visit-based ADA and including all three treatment 
arms  (serum  trough  concentrations  trough  Week  24  were  not  presented  for  “the  switchers” 
EU-Humira/AVT02 group). The applicant was also required to present the serum through concentrations 
for NAbs-negative PsO subjects, through Week 16 of study AVT02-GL-301, as these have not been found 
in the dossier. The applicant provided the requested data (additionally up to week 54). The impact of 
ADA and NAb on the serum trough concentration has been considerable. Generally, within ADA and NAb 
subgroups,  there  has  been  no  difference  between  treatment  arms  in  adalimumab  serum  trough 
concentrations  throughout  the  study  period  for  all  treatment  groups.  Efficacy,  in  terms  of  the  mean 
percent improvement in PASI at weeks 8, 12 and 16 was similar between treatment arms in ADA positive 
as  well  as  in  ADA  negative  subjects.  The  percent  improvement  from  baseline  in  PASI  status  at  each 
timepoint  was  similar  for  subjects  with  pre-existing  ADA  status  compared  to  subjects  with  treatment 
induced  ADA.  No  meaningful  difference  in  efficacy  or  safety  was  seen  between  treatment  groups  in 
subjects with pre-existing or treatment induced ADA. 
A great majority of patients developed ADA. However, no anaphylaxis or other serious hypersensitivity 
reactions were seen. 
A similar percentage of ADA/NAb positive subjects reported TEAEs across treatment groups during the 
study. Among those who were tested ADA negative, more subjects reported TEAEs in AVT02 treatment 
groups. 18 ADA negative subjects (48.6%) in AVT02 group and 11 ADA negative subjects (35.5%) in 
Humira  group  reported  TEAEs  through  Week  16.  From  Week  16  through  Week  54  of  the  study,  the 
amount  of  ADA  negative  subjects  reporting  TEAEs  were  18  (69.2%),  8  (50.0%),  and  4  (28.6%)  in 
AVT02/AVT02,  Humira/AVT02  and  Humira/Humira  groups,  respectively.  Of  NAb  negative  subjects, 
21 (65.6%) in AVT02/AVT02, 9 (50.0%) in Humira/AVT02, and 6 (30.0%) in Humira/Humira reported 
TEAEs from Week 16 through Week 54 of the study. 
Although  greater  percentage  of  those  who  were  ADA/NAb  negative  reported  TEAEs  in  AVT02/AVT02 
group, it should be noted that the numbers of those ADA/NAb negative subjects were low. In conclusion, 
the difference seen in TEAE reporting between treatment groups is not considered clinically significant. 
The  formation  of  ADAs  and  NAbs  had  a  high  frequency  in  study  AVT02-GL-101  after  a  single-dose 
administration of 40 mg s.c. of either AVT02, EU-Humira or US-Humira, overall, with ADA titers slightly 
lower in AVT02 group as compared to EU-Humira and US-Humira groups. Most of the subjects became 
ADA positive through Day 64 EOS, i.e., 96.1% in AVT02 group, 96.0% in EU-Humira group and 95.3% 
in US-Humira group, respectively. 
The frequency of subjects with positive NAb increased through Day 64 EOS. At Day 64 the percentage 
of  subjects  with  positive  NAb  were  high  in  each  treatment  group:  80.6%  in  AVT02  group,  86.9%  in 
EU-Humira and 87.0% in US-Humira group, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021

It is well known that development of antibodies causes increased clearance, lower drug concentrations 
and  subsequent  decreased  exposure  of  adalimumab.  Presence  of  NAb  can  affect  the  PK  profile  of 
adalimumab, especially the elimination phase. Thus, the applicant was asked to present box and whisker 
of plots of AUC0-t (h·ng/mL), AUC0-inf (h·ng/mL), Cmax (ng/mL) by Treatment and NAb Status (Day 1-64) 
– Pharmacokinetic population. In the response, the applicant provided the asked data, and it could be 
seen  that  presence  of  Nab  affects  PK  profile  of  adalimumab  especially  in  the  elimination  phase.  The 
impact of NAb presence on the PK parameters Cmax is minor or negligible. The impact of NAb presence 
on the PK parameters AUC0-t and AUC0-inf is considerable. Comparisons of AVT02 vs EU-Humira vs US-
Humira within the NAb positive and NAb negative subgroups showed no relevant differences between 
treatment groups. 
In study AVT02-GL-102, most of the subjects became ADA positive through Day 64 EOS, i.e., 97% in 
AVT02-AI group and 100% in AVT02-PFS group, respectively. The frequency of subjects with positive 
NAb increased through Day 64 EOS. At Day 64 the percentage of subjects with positive NAb were 86.5% 
in AVT02-AI group and 85.7% in AVT02-PFS group, respectively.  
2.8.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the safety point of view, no major concerns regarding similarity have emerged based on the data 
presented by the applicant. The number of subjects is sufficient for comparing the safety profile of the 
biosimilar  candidate  AVT02  and  reference  medicinal  product  Humira  and  studying  the  safety  of  a 
biosimilar  product  for  up  to  one  year  is  adequate.  Broadly,  the  number,  severity  and  type  of  TEAEs, 
SAEs,  AEs  of  special  interest,  treatment  discontinuations  due  to  AEs,  and  laboratory  findings  were 
comparable between AVT02 and Humira and mirroring the safety profile as described in the SmPC of 
Humira. 
Most subjects in all treatment arms (up to 96%) became positive for ADAs over the presented 54-week 
period.  No  clinically  significant  difference  in  ADA  incidence  or  titres  between  AVT02  and  Humira  was 
apparent in the submitted data. A trend for lower drug concentrations was seen in the Humira group, 
especially among NAb positive subjects. Among NAb negative patients, more subjects reported TEAEs of 
mild severity in the AVT02 treatment arm. The difference in detected NAbs and drug concentrations is 
acceptable, as no meaningful differences in safety were detected.

risk for developing infections. Patients 
must therefore be monitored closely for 
infections, before, during and after 
treatment with adalimumab. Because the 
elimination of adalimumab may take up 
to four months, monitoring should be 
continued throughout this period. It also 
warns that treatment with adalimumab 
should not be initiated in patients with 
active infections including chronic or 
localised infections until infections are 
controlled. Patients who develop a new 
infection while undergoing treatment 
with adalimumab should be monitored 
closely and undergo a complete 
diagnostic evaluation. Administration of 
adalimumab should be discontinued if a 
patient develops a new serious infection 
or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial 
or antifungal therapy should be initiated 
until the infection is controlled. 
Physicians should exercise caution when 
considering the use of adalimumab in 
patients with a history of recurring 
infection or with underlying conditions 
which may predispose patients to 
infections, including the use of 
concomitant immunosuppressive 
medications. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC also states that, 
for patients who develop the signs and 
symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight 
loss, sweats, cough, dyspnoea, and/or 
pulmonary infiltrates or other serious 
systemic illness with or without 
concomitant shock an invasive fungal 
infection should be suspected, and 
administration of adalimumab should be 
promptly discontinued. Diagnosis and 
administration of empiric antifungal 
therapy in these patients should be 
made in consultation with a physician 
with expertise in the care of patients 
with invasive fungal infections.

Prescribers are reminded of the risk of 
false negative tuberculin skin test 
results, especially in patients who are 
severely ill or immunocompromised. If 
active TB is diagnosed, adalimumab 
therapy must not be initiated. 
If latent TB is suspected, a physician 
with expertise in the treatment of TB 
should be consulted. In addition, 
appropriate treatment must be started 
with anti-TB prophylaxis treatment 
before the initiation of adalimumab, and 
in accordance with local 
recommendations. 
Use of anti-TB prophylaxis treatment 
should also be considered before the

Summary of quality comparability data 
On the quality level, a comprehensive biosimilarity exercise has been performed following the general 
principles  outlined  in  the  guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-
derived proteins as active substance; Quality issues (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012). 
Comparative analysis has been performed using the AVT02 DP in a pre-filled syringe (AVT02-DP PFS) 
presentation  with  a  0.4mL  fill  or  0.8mL  fill.  Total  of  9  AVT02  DP  batches  manufactured  from 
9 independent  DS  batches,  28  EU-Humira  batches,  and  11  US-Humira  have  been  included  for  the 
comparability studies. One clinical AVT02 DP (DP180004) has been used in the comparability studies. 
During the course of development of AVT02, five separate comparative analytical head-to-head (H2H) 
studies  have  been  performed.  A  SD  approach  was  chosen  to  set  comparability  ranges,  and  the  SD 
multipliers were chosen based on criticality ranking. Most of the comparability ranges were set at ± 3SD; 
these were for CQAs ranked as high, moderate and low criticality. Tighter range (± 2.5SD) was set for 
the CQAs with a highest risk. Comparability ranges are considered supportive of the overall similarity 
assessment.  In  addition,  in  most  cases  sufficient  raw  data  has  been  provided  to  allow  assessment  of 
biosimilarity independently of statistical approach chosen. 
Analytical  comparability  studies  included  primary,  secondary  and  higher  order  structures,  post 
translational  modifications  (charge  variants  and  glycan  profiles),  purity  and  impurities,  quantity, 
biological activity of Fab and Fc related functions, and comparative stability studies. 
Summary of non-clinical comparability data 
Comparability at in vitro functional level was assessed by head-to-head assays including evaluation of 
TNF  neutralisation  and  Fc-effector  functions  using  cell-based  assays  (TNF  neutralisation,  ADCC,  CDC) 
and ligand binding assays using both SPR and ECL-ELISA methodology. These are the same as stated in 
the summary of quality comparability data. 
One pharmacokinetics and local tolerability study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. 
The nonclinical development plan is in agreement with EMA guidelines for biosimilar products.

Summary of clinical comparability data 
Comparability of AVT02 to EU-Humira in terms of PK, safety and immunogenicity was assessed in one 
randomised, double-blind single dose study in 390 healthy volunteers (AVT02-GL-101). Comparability 
of clinical efficacy, safety, immunogenicity was assessed in one randomised double-blind multiple dose 
study in 412 patients with plaque psoriasis (PsO) (AVT02-GL-301). 
In addition, one single arm, multiple dose study (AVT02-GL-303) was performed in 107 patients with 
rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  for  device  development  of  the  autoinjector.  Comparability  between  the 
autoinjector and the PFS was assessed in one randomised single dose study in 207 healthy volunteers 
(AVT02-GL-102). 
The development plan was in agreement with EMA guidelines on development of biosimilar products. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality data 
Similarity between AVT02 and EU-Humira has been demonstrated for the following physico-chemical and 
biological properties: 
- 
Primary and higher order structure (with some minor exceptions) 
-  Content and extractable volume 
-  Size heterogeneity (with some exceptions) 
-  Glycosylation (with the exception of afucosylated glycans) 
-  Binding to soluble and transmembrane TNFα and neutralisation of TNFα 
-  Reverse signaling activity 
-  Binding to following Fc-receptors (FcγRIIb, FcγRI and FcRn) 
-  Binding to C1q and CDC activity  
-  ADCC activity (minor differences are observed) 
- 
- 
Inhibition of TNFα-induced apoptosis, IL-8 release, inhibition of expression of adhesion molecules 
Induction of regulatory macrophages and subsequent T-cell anti-proliferation 
-  Stability under stressed conditions and forced degradation 
Non-clinical data 
The  functional  similarity  was  demonstrated  in  in  vitro  assays  relevant  for  the  mode  of  action  of 
adalimumab  (see  above  Quality  data  in  regards  of  the  assay  battery).  No  such  differences  between 
AVT02 and EU-Humira were noted that would have implications to clinical efficacy or safety. 
There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles and local tolerance of AVT02 and 
EU-Humira in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Clinical data 
Pharmacokinetics 
In  the  comparison  of  all  combined  data  from  parts  1  and  2  (pivotal  PK  study  AVT02-GL-101)  for  the 
AVT02 group with the EU-Humira and US-Humira treatment groups, the 90% CIs of the geometric LS 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 114/122 
 
 
 
mean ratios for the three primary PK parameters (i.e. Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf) were all within 80% and 
125%. In the AUC0-t between AVT02 and EU-Humira, the lower limit of the 90%CI was 1.00, which is 
acceptable. The sensitivity analysis supported the PK similarity between AVT02 and EU-Humira. 
In the confirmatory clinical study (AVT02-GL-301) in PsO patients, the mean trough concentrations were 
quite comparable although slightly higher in the AVT02 group than in the EU-Humira group both in overall 
population (PK data up to week 16) and in PASI responders (PK data on PASI responders from up to 
week 54). 
Efficacy 
In  study  AVT02-GL-301,  in  the  FAS  LOCF  ANCOVA  analysis,  the  LS  mean  difference  (SE)  between 
treatment arms in percent improvement in PASI from baseline to week 16 was 0.4 (1.39). Mean actual 
PASI scores fell from 23.2 and 23.0 at baseline to 2.0 and 1.7 at week 16 (observed data) for AVT02 
and  Humira,  respectively.  The  95%  CI  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  within  the  predefined 
equivalence margin  of  ±10%.  The 95% CI for all sensitivity analyses were also within ±10%. Hence, the 
primary  objective  was  met  and  sensitivity  analyses  confirmed  the  robustness  of  the  primary  analysis. 
Similarity in PASI change from baseline was shown also at the most sensitive time points, week 8 and week 
12. The mean difference in percent improvement in PASI from BL to Week 8 was 0.2 (95% CI: -4.55 to 
4.20). 
Subgroup  analyses  at  week  16  showed  no  significant  difference  with  respect  to  the  primary  endpoint 
between AVT02 and Humira treatment groups when analysed by gender, PsA status, use of prior biologic 
therapy, ADA status or age. 
Results from all secondary efficacy endpoints (PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100, sPGA, DLQI) 
were supportive of similarity up to week 50. 
Safety 
In the pivotal Phase III safety study AVT02-GL-301 in PsO patients, TEAEs were reported in 92 (44.9%) 
patients in the AVT02 treatment group and in 91 (44.0%) patients in the EU-Humira treatment group 
during Stage 1 through Week 16. The only TEAEs reported by more than 5% of subjects in any treatment 
group were injection site reaction and nasopharyngitis. During Stage 2 from Week 16 through Week 54, 
58.9% of subjects on AVT02/AVT02, 47.4% of subjects on Humira/AVT02, and 50.0% of subjects on 
Humira/Humira, respectively, reported at least 1 TEAE. This difference between groups was largely due 
to  a  slightly  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  AVT02/AVT02  group  who  reported  injection  site 
reactions and nasopharyngitis compared to other treatment groups. Adverse events of special interest 
were reported by similar percentage of patients in all treatment groups during the study. In the subset 
of patients with psoriatic arthritis, the incidence of TEAEs was comparable in study AVT02-GL-301. 
Taken  together,  the  number  and  pattern  of  TEAEs  and  proportion  of  patients  reporting  them  were  in 
general comparable in AVT02 and Humira groups during the study AVT02-GL-301. No major differences 
in frequency or pattern of TESAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug or AESIs were seen 
between treatment groups. 
The safety results from the Phase I single-dose studies in healthy subjects are considered supportive of 
the pivotal safety data. 
Immunogenicity

No clinically significant difference between AVT02 and Humira in ADA incidence or ADA titre was apparent 
throughout the 54-week study in the pivotal Phase III trial (AVT02-GL-301). 
In  the  pivotal  PK  study  (AVT02-GL-101)  the  ADA  and  NAb  frequencies  and  ADA  titres  were  similar 
between AVT02 and EU-Humira at Day 64 (EOS). Most of the subjects became ADA positive through Day 
64  EOS,  i.e.  96.1%  in  AVT02  group,  96.0%  in  EU-Humira  group  and  95.3%  in  US-Humira  group, 
respectively.

3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Libmyris has been developed as a biosimilar to the reference product Humira. In this application only 
the 100mg/ml strength has been used in clinical studies and this is the only strength applied for in two 
vial sizes; 0.4ml and 0.8ml. Humira is available also in 50mg/ml strength. 
The development plan to show similarity between AVT02 and Humira was adequate and in agreement 
with EMA guidelines on development of biosimilar products. 
Quality aspects 
Overall, a comprehensive similarity exercise following the general principles outlined in the guideline on 
similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance; 
Quality  issues  (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012)  has  been  performed.  The  comparability  exercise  is 
mostly  based  on  comparison  of  analytical  characterisation  data  collected  during  the  years  of  drug 
development. For most quality attributes high similarity has been demonstrated.

Slightly  higher  amounts  of  HMWs  are  observed  in  AVT02  (0.7-1.3%)  when  compared  to  EU-Humira 
(0.29-0.5%). HMWs were further characterised with SEC-MALS and a peak correlating with higher order 
aggregates was detected only for AVT02. As requested at D120, the applicant further characterised the 
SEC variant fractions via CE-SDS, LC-MS, and SEC-MALS utilizing heat stress samples where the HOA 
where enriched in both AVT02 and EU-Humira. However, due to assay limitations, no solid conclusion on 
the HMW1 was derived from CE-SDS (R & NR) nor LC-MS studies. Enriched SEC fractions were further 
analysed by SEC-MALS and confirmed that AVT02 and Humira HMW1 mainly contains Adalimumab higher 
order aggregates and HMW2 fractions mainly contain Adalimumab dimer. The impact on potency was 
also studied confirming that the TNFα potency, ADCC activity and FcγRIIIa binding was similar for AVT02 
and Humira for the dimer and the HOA. The data demonstrated that AVT02 and Humira HMWs (especially 
HMW1) had reduced potency and reduced effector functions. Considering that the HMWs are controlled 
at DS and DP release with tight enough acceptance criteria (<2% and <2.5%, respectively), and that 
overall, the HMWs are detected in very low levels in AVT02 batches, the applicant’s conclusion can be 
agreed. The minor difference in HMW species is not expected to have clinical impact. 
A  lower  level of  afucosylated  glycans,  including  high  mannose  glycans  is  observed  in  AVT02  batches. 
Although a difference could be detected in the glycan profiles of AVT02 and EU Humira, this did not result 
in clear differences in relevant Fc receptor binding assays and resulted only in a minor difference in the 
ADCC  assay  using  PBMCs  as  effector  cells.  No  differences  were  seen  in  the  ADCC  RGA  assay.  It  is 
therefore  considered  unlikely  that  the  difference  seen  in  the  ADCC  PBMC  assays  would  be  clinically 
significant. However, as ADCC is considered as a likely mechanism of action for adalimumab in certain 
indications and a clear correlation between the level of total afucosylated glycans and high mannoses 
and ADCC activity can be observed, stringent specifications for total afucosylation, high mannoses, and 
afucosylated glycans (-high mannoses) is considered necessary. At D195 responses the applicant agreed 
to include an additional specification for total afucosylated glycans. It was also agreed to set dual DS 
testing  via  two  different  methods  (Rapifluor  and  2AB  labelling)  for  total  afucosylated  glycans.    Until 
further experience has been gained with the Rapifluor method and an acceptance limit for Rapifluor total 
afulcosylation is justified in a way that it will ensure that AVT02 will maintain an ADCC activity similar to 
EU Humira. 
The  acceptance  limits  for  glycan  structures  should  be  reconsidered  once  30  batches  has  been 
manufactured.  The  2AB  labelling  method  should  be  validated  at  the  release  site  within  a  time  period 
proposed by the applicant. See the list of recommendations. 
Nonclinical aspects 
A  stepwise  development  and  the  totality  of  the  evidence  approach  was  applied  in  line  with 
recommendations from EMA scientific advice and biosimilar guideline (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) 
to  demonstrate  the  biosimilarity  between  ATV02  and  Humira.  All  in  vitro  comparability  data  were 
(included under the M3.2.R.3) are assessed in the Quality section in order to avoid repeating the data. 
The  data  allowed  drawing  broad  conclusions  of  the  similarity  between  AVT02  and  EU-Humira  for  the 
majority of functional parameters.  
In addition, nonclinical dossier included one cynomolgus monkey study to assess pharmacokinetics and 
local tolerability. This study was not designed to demonstrate the similarity in PK or tolerability and is 
considered supportive. The pharmacokinetic and local tolerance profiles of AVT02) and EU-Humira did 
not differ significantly. 
Clinical aspects 
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 117/122 
 
 
 
 
 
Biosimilarity  has  been  formally  demonstrated  between  AVT02  and  EU-Humira  and  US-Humira  in  the 
pivotal PK study (AVT02-GL-101) using healthy subjects as in the primary PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-t 
and AUC0-inf, the 90%CI for the ratio of test-to-reference/comparator fell within the acceptance range of 
80.00-125.00%. The sensitivity analyses support biosimilarity. Additional support for similarity in terms 
of PK between AVT02 and EU-Humira was obtained in the clinical study in PsO patients (AVT02-GL-301). 
In this study, the mean Ctrough concentrations were quite comparable although slightly higher with AVT02 
than with EU-Humira. The trend for lower drug concentrations in the Humira group was seen especially 
among NAb positive subjects but this did not lead to meaningful differences in efficacy or safety. 
The  results  showing  similarity  in  efficacy  seem  robust  and  from  the  safety  point  of  view,  no  major 
concerns  regarding  similarity  have  emerged  based  on  the  data  presented  in  the  applicant’s  initial 
submission.  The  safety  data  from  the  study  AVT02-GL-301  indicated  in  general  similar  incidence  and 
pattern  of  TEAEs,  TESAEs,  AESIs  between  the  AVT02  and  Humira  treatment  groups.  No  new  or 
unexpected safety findings were thus far evident. 
More ADA/NAb negative subjects reported adverse events in treatment groups receiving AVT02 than in 
those receiving Humira. However, these differences are not considered clinically significant, considering 
also the low numbers of ADA/NAb negative subjects in this study. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
All indications granted for the originator EU approved Humira are applied for Libmyris (AVT02). These 
include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), active enthesitis-related 
arthritis,  axial  spondyloarthritis  (ankylosing  spondylitis  [AS],  and  axial  spondyloarthritis  without 
radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), adult and paediatric plaque psoriasis (Ps), adult 
and paediatric Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult and adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa 
(HS), adult and paediatric non-infectious uveitis (UV). 
As referenced by the applicant, the MoA of adalimumab therapy is primarily based on both inhibition of 
pro-inflammatory effects such as apoptosis, cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, and stimulation of 
anti-inflammatory effects through reverse signalling. Although the MoA of adalimumab is not completely 
elucidated, it is well accepted that adalimumab acts as a TNFα antagonist by binding to and neutralising 
soluble TNFα (sTNFα) and tmTNFα. 
Neutralisation of sTNFα is a common mechanism across the non-IBD indications (RA, JIA, AS, PsA, Ps, 
HS, and UV), and the primary mechanism by which adalimumab particularly exerts its effect. 
In addition to neutralisation of sTNFα, tmTNFα binding is considered to play a key role in treatment of 
the IBD indications (CD and UC). 
Other  mechanisms  that  could  contribute  to  the  biological  activity  of  adalimumab  include  Fc-mediated 
binding which could induce ADCC, CDC and regulatory macrophage activation although the balance of 
evidence suggests that ADCC and CDC do not play a major role. 
In  comprehensive  in  vitro  analyses,  the  similarity  was  demonstrated  for  the  majority  of  functional 
parameters relevant for the mode of actions of adalimumab, supporting extrapolation of efficacy to all 
indications.  
Results for primary PK parameters AUC0-inf, AUC0-last and Cmax support the conclusion of biosimilarity of 
AVT02 to EU-Humira.  
Assessment report  
EMA/771818/2021 
Page 118/122 
 
 
 
 
Extrapolation of the results to all indications approved for the originator is supported as similarity has 
been shown by the following in vitro tests: Inhibition of TNFα-induced IL-8 and IL-6 secretion, Inhibition 
of  TNFα-induced  expression  of  adhesion  molecules  on  HUVEC  cells  (demonstrate  MoA  valid  across  all 
therapeutic indications of adalimumab); inhibition of apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and induction 
of  regulatory  macrophages  by  MLR  (sustain  MoA  valid in IBD).  Similarity  has also  been  shown in  PK, 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.  
3.6.  Additional considerations  
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, biosimilarity of Libmyris to EU-approved Humira has been 
established. The benefit/risk balance is positive and comparable to the reference product. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Libmyris is favourable in the following indications: 
Rheumatoid arthritis  
Libmyris in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for:  
• 
• 
the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the 
response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate has been 
inadequate.  
the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously 
treated with methotrexate.  
Libmyris can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued 
treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.  
Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray 
and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Libmyris in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or 
more DMARD. Libmyris can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when

1.  Introduction 
On 01 June 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study VX20-445-121 for Kaftrio 
(elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Kaftrio is currently indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
(CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Kaftrio obtained initially a marketing authorization 
in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with 
a minimal function (MF) mutation in 2020. In 2021, the indication was extended to patients aged 12 
years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Recently, the indication was extended to children with CF aged 6 
years through 11. 
Elexacaftor and tezacaftor are CFTR correctors and facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of 
F508del-CFTR, leading to an increase in the amount of CFTR protein, while ivacaftor increases channel 
gating of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor results in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR chloride transport. 
Within this procedure, the Applicant submitted the results of study VX20-445-121. Study VX20-445-
121 is a Phase 3b Open-label Study Evaluating the Safety of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor 
Combination Therapy in Subjects with Cystic Fibrosis heterozygous for F508 del and a minimal function 
mutation (F/MF genotypes) who are 12 years of age or older and who participated in either parent 
studies (VX19-445-117 or VX20-445-126). Study VX19-445-117 and Study VX20-445-126 have been 
previously reviewed in EMA/H/C/00529/0010/P46 and EMEA/H/C/005269/0009/P46 respectively. 
The MAH stated that study VX20-445-121 is like the parent studies a stand-alone study. The parent 
studies were submitted with previous Article 46 procedures (EMA/H/C/00529/0010/P46 and 
EMEA/H/C/00529/0009/P46) respectively and are currently still under review.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
In Study VX20-445-121, the following tablets were used:  
• 100-mg ELX/50-mg TEZ/75-mg IVA fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet 
• 150-mg IVA tablet  
All these tablets are authorised for this population and age group. The applied posology aligns with the 
dose approved for patients aged ≥ 12 years.  
•  Morning dose two tablets of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor 100/50/75 mg 
• 
Evening dose: one tablet of 150 mg ivacaftor.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted final report(s) for study VX20-445-121. 
Clinical study number and title 
Study VX20-445-121 (Study 121) was a Phase 3b, multicentre, open-label study evaluating the safety 
of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy in subjects with cystic fibrosis.  
Description 
Study VX20-445-121 was a Phase 3b, multicenter, open-label study in CF subjects aged ≥ 12 years 
who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a Minimal Function mutation (F/MF) and who 
completed a parent study (VX19-445-117 [Study 117] or VX20-445-126 [Study 126]).  
The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in subjects with 
heterogenous F508 and MF mutation.  
The planned study duration was approximately 52 weeks (from the first dose of study drug in this 
study), including a 48-week Treatment Period and a 4-week Safety Follow-up Period. The study design 
is depicted in figure 1 below.

Assessor’s comment 
Study VX-445-117 and study VX-445-126 were Phase 3b, open-label, single arm studies in CF subjects 
12 years of age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a Minimal Function mutation (F/MF 
genotypes).  
The patients included in study VX-117 had to have an abnormal glucose tolerance at screening, while 
the included patients in study VX-126 had to have an FEV1 between 30% and 90% of predicted mean 
value.  
After a screening period, patients were open-label treated for 13 weeks (study VX-126) or 48 weeks 
study VX-117), with the opportunity to enroll in the open label extension study VX-121, resulting in a 
longer pre-treatment duration for the patients from study VX-117 before inclusion of the trial VX20-
445-121. For those who did not enroll in the open label study, a safety follow up was conducted within 
28 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Treatments 
Study drug tablets were administered orally as ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h. 
Subjects received 2 ELX 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg tablets in the morning and 1 tablet of IVA 150 
mg in the evening.

Objective 
The primary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in heterozygotic F508/MF 
subjects with CF.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA based on adverse events (AEs), 
clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry. 
Sample size 
Up to approximately 160 subjects were expected to enroll in this open-label extension study. 
Randomisation and blinding  
Not applicable. This was an interventional open-label study.  
Statistical Methods 
The safety analysis was conducted for subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in this open-
label study. The safety analysis was descriptive only. 
Conduct of the trial  
GCP 
The study was conducted following GCP.  
Amendments 
The original protocol was dated 13 April 2021. The study was amended once (14 Feb 2022) to (1) 
remove parent study VX19-445-114 and to update the number of planned subjects and (2) Updated 
that study drug does not need to be discontinued for a male subject whose female partner becomes 
pregnant during study participation. 
Covid 
The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the study safety measures were 
implemented to continue participation in this study while ensuring their safety by minimizing the risk to 
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) exposure through travel. These measures were enabled based on 
country and local regulations and site-level considerations (e.g., site closure due to COVID-19). 
Results 
Participant flow 
The first patient was included on 14 Jan 2022; the last patient last visit was on 20 Dec 2022. The 
study was conducted in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, and Spain.  
A total of 86 subjects were enrolled. This was lower than the planned number because not all subjects 
of the parent studies elected to continue to the separate open-label study.  
None of the study subjects completed the planned 48-week Treatment Period mainly because most 
subjects (75 [87.2%] subjects) elected to discontinue treatment due to commercial drug availability, 
while a total of 10 patients were enrolled in another qualified Vertex trial (Table 2).  
One patient discontinued the study because of an AE

Adverse events  
The most common AEs (occurring in ≥10% of subjects overall) were COVID-19 (n=16 (18.6%), 
infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (n=11 (12.8%)), and nasopharyngitis n=9 (10.5%)).  
Related AE 
A total of 10 patients had a related AE; 1 patient had a related SAE (see section SAE) .  
The related AEs were mostly found in the SOC investigations (n=7) and referred to alanine 
transaminase (ALT) increased (n=2), aspartate transaminase (AST) increased (n=2), blood creatinine 
kinase (CK) increased (n=2), blood bilirubin increased (n=1), blood unconjugated bilirubin increased 
(n=1) and gamma GT increased (n=1) and platelet count decreased (n=1).  
The SOC hepatobiliary disorders also included 2 related events i.e. cholestasis (n=1) and 
hyperbilirubinemia (n=1). 
SAEs and death 
There were 4 (4.7%) subjects who had at least 1 SAE. SAEs of gastroenteritis viral, malnutrition, and 
anxiety occurred in 1 subject each; 1 subject had SAEs of ALT increased and AST increased. 
All SAEs were considered not to be related to study medication, except for the SAEs of ALT increased 
and AST increased that occurred in the same subject. The observed ALT- and  AST elevations were  >8 
ULN, while the liver biopsy revealed compatibility with a drug-induced liver injury. These events were 
considered mild in severity by the investigator. They led to treatment discontinuation. The elevated 
liver enzymes returned to baseline value during follow up.

Discontinuation 
One subject had related SAEs of ALT increased and AST increased (see also section SAEs and death, 
and AESI: Elevated transaminases).  
Treatment interruption 
One subject had unlikely related moderate to severe AEs of ALT increased, AST increased, and blood 
creatine phosphokinase (CK) increased leading to treatment interruption. These adverse events 
resolved without treatment.  
Adverse events of specific interests 
Adverse events of specific interest are elevated transaminases and rash.  
AESI: Elevated transaminases 
A total of 5 (5.8%) subjects experienced an adverse event of elevated transaminases. Most events 
were considered of mild intensity. One subject had unlikely related events of severe AST increased and 
moderate ALT increased, which resulted in study drug interruption (Table 4). 
A total of 3 (3.5%) subjects had a treatment-emergent elevated transaminase event, with 2 related 
and 1 unlikely related as determined by the investigator. Of these 3 subjects, 2 had 4 events that were 
considered mild and the dose was not changed. The other subject had 2 events were considered mild 
according to the investigator,but led to drug discontinuation (Table 4, see also section SAE).

Adverse events were coded using MeDRA version 25.1. Severity assessment by the Investigator.  
AESI: Rash 
No subjects had a rash event during the study. One subject (1%) experienced a mild rash during the 
parent study; the rash was considered unlikely related to study medication.  
Lab values, vital signs ECG, pulse oximetry, and ophthalmologic examination  
Liver function tests  
Most subjects had ALT/AST values that remained within the normal range. Three (3.5%) subjects had 
ALT or AST >3 × ULN, 1 (1.2%) subject had ALT or AST >5 × ULN, and 1 (1.2%) subject had ALT or 
AST >8 × ULN. No subject had elevations of ALT or AST >3 × ULN concurrent with newly occurred 
elevation of TBILI >2 × ULN. 
Blood bilirubin 
Most subjects had bilirubin values that remained within the normal range. Overall, 8.1% of the 
subjects had an elevation in total bilirubin (TBILI) >2 × to ≤3 × ULN, and 1 (1.2%) subject had an 
elevation in TBILI >3 × to ≤10 × ULN.  
Creatinine kinase  
AEs of blood creatine phosphokinase (CK) increased occurred in 3 (3.5%) subjects, no subject 
discontinued treatment due to this AE. One (1.2%) subject had a severe, unlikely related AE of blood 
CK increased leading to study drug interruption.  
CHMP comment 
As usual, no cause was reported for the reported lab deviations. The reported deviations are in line 
with previous reported data.  
Vital signs 
Mean SBP and DBP and pulse rate were variable over time. No specific trends were observed.  
There were 5 (5.8%) subjects with SBP >140 mm Hg, and no subject with SBP >160 mm Hg; There 
were 2 (2.3%) subjects with DBP >90 mm Hg, and no subject with DBP >100 mm Hg.  
One subject had an unrelated AE of hypertension of mild intensity considered not to be related to 
medication.  
ECG 
The ECG conducted at baseline and at the end of the study did not reveal a specific trend.  
Ophthalmologic examination 
Ophthalmologic examinations were only conducted for the 27 subjects who were <18 years of age on 
the date of informed consent in a parent study. No subject had a treatment emergent AE of cataract. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
With this article 46 procedure, the MAH presented the final study results of Study VX20-445-121, a 
Phase 3b, open-label study in CF subjects 12 years of age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a 
minimal function mutation (F/MF genotypes).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/569523/2023  
Page 10/19 
 
 
 
Study 121 included patients who completed the parent study VX19-445-117 and VX20-445-126. 
Updates of sections 4.2, 4.4. and 4.8, as requested by the CHMP, were adopted by the Applicant. 
These updates were regarding the risk of elevated ALT and AST and drug induced liver injury.  
Study VX121 was designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability (48 weeks) of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA. However, interpretation of obtained results is hampered, mainly due to the single-arm 
trial design.  
Results 
Population and treatment period 
The study included a total of 86 patients i.e. 53 % of the pre-planned study population. Although the 
study was designed to evaluate the long-term safety (48 weeks), most patients prematurely elected to 
discontinue their participation because of the commercial availability of the drug. A total of 10 patients 
prematurely stopped because they were included in another Vertex study. One subject stopped 
prematurely due to treatment-emergent AEs (elevated transaminases).  
None of the patients completed the study, and the actual median study treatment was 22 weeks. The 
mean age of the study population was 25.3 years, with 27 patients aged 12-18 years upon entry of the 
respective parent study.  
Safety results 
Most patients (70.9%) experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE). Most AEs were of mild intensity and 
resembled adverse events correlated to signs and symptoms of CF disease and the side effects of the 
triple combination. The frequency of most of AE-events and abnormal lab values were in line with 
previous reports, including the open label extension study 117 (EMEA/H/C/00529/P46/010).  
During the study no new safety events emerged. However, one subject needed to discontinue 
treatment because of an SAE of elevated AST/ALT > 8 ULN. These LFT elevations were considered to 
be related to treatment, which was confirmed with a liver biopsy. These observations led to a 
recommendation to provide a stronger warning about the risk of drug-induced elevated transaminases, 
which resulted in an update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Subgroup analysis by age (i.e. adolescents 12-18 years vs. adults ≥18 years) have not been 
presented. It is acceptable to pool results for adolescents and adults in line with previous procedures 
for ELX/TEZ/IVA and no separate analysis per age group is requested (see also procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005269/P46/009 and EMEA/H/C/005269/P46/010). 
Conclusion 
This single arm, open-label study provided additional long-term safety with a median duration of 22 
weeks for Kaftrio in the treatment of heterozygotic F508/MF subjects with CF.  
The currently provided data show that the safety profile aligns with previously reported data, although 
a stronger warning about the risk of drug-induced transaminases is warranted. The MAH should submit 
an appropriate variation within 30 days after finalisation of Art 46 WS procedures 
EMEA/H/C/005269/P46/013 and EMEA/H/C/005269/P46/014 to implement the agreed changes to the 
SmPC (sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall, the B/R of Kaftrio remains positive.

The SmPC needs to be updated, however, to emphasise the warning about the risk of drug induced 
elevated transaminases. The MAH should submit an appropriate variation within 30 days after 
finalisation of Art 46 WS procedures EMEA/H/C/005269/P46/013 and EMEA/H/C/005269/P46/014 to 
implement the agreed changes to the SmPC (sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). 
 Fulfilled: 
No further action required; however a variation should be submitted to implement the agreed changes 
to the SmPC (sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). The MAH should commit to submit this variation application 
within 30 days after finalisation of Art 46 WS procedures EMEA/H/C/005269/P46/013 and 
EMEA/H/C/005269/P46/014.

4.  Request for supplementary information 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  The planned number for inclusion was n=160, with an actual inclusion of 86 patients i.e. 53 % of the 
planned population. This raises the following concerns:  
a)  Please clarify, why not all patients rolled over from the parent study to this observation study and/or 
why the inclusion was prematurely stopped   
b)  The applicant is asked to explain why the study was prematurely ended as none of the participants 
completed the study.

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1 
The planned number for inclusion was n=160, with an actual inclusion of 86 patients i.e. 53 % of the 
planned population. This raises the following concerns:  
a)  Please clarify, why not all patients rolled over from the parent study to this observation study and/or 
why the inclusion was prematurely stopped   
b)  The applicant is asked to explain why the study was prematurely ended as none of the participants 
completed the study.  
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
a) Enrollment in Study 121 was lower than the pre-specified number due to subjects who elected not 
to participate in Study 121. As these subjects completed the parent studies, reasons for not continuing 
to the separate open-label extension study were not captured in the parent study databases. 
•  Of the 66 subjects who completed treatment in Study 117, 38 subjects elected not to participate in 
rollover Study 121. 
•  Of the 79 subjects who completed treatment in Study 126, 26 subjects elected not to participate in 
rollover Study 121. 
b) Per protocol, end of study was defined as the last scheduled visit (or scheduled contact) of the last 
subject. As all subjects who participated in Study 121 elected to discontinue treatment and the study 
(either due to commercial drug availability or to participate in another qualified Vertex study [Study 
121 CSR/Listing 16.2.1.1]), the study completed before any subject completed treatment. 
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response   
a)  The Applicant provided the numbers of subjects who rolled over from the parent studies and indicated 
that inclusion was lower because not all subjects of the parent studies elected to continue to the 
separate open-label study. Reasons for this were not captured. It is noted that a total of 145 subjects 
completed either one of the parent studies, indicating that the planned number of n=160 was a very 
optimistic number for inclusion to start with.  
b)  According to the Applicant’s response, all subjects elected to discontinue treatment and thus 
participation in the study. Whether that was on their own account or on account of the Applicant or 
Investigator was not specified. It can be concluded that the reason for prematurely ending the study

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

was that all subjects who were eligible to participate in the study, either decided not to participate or, 
in case they had decided to participate, elected to discontinue participation in the study. 
Conclusion: issue resolved. 
Question 2 
It is also noted that most patients did not complete the study due to commercial drug availability. 
However, this was not a stopping criterium in the study. Please clarify. 
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
As specified in Study 121 Protocol v2.0 Section 9.9, “Subjects may withdraw from the study at any 
time at their own request or the request of the subject’s parent or legal guardian.” While commercial 
availability was not expressly mentioned in the protocol as a stopping criterion, discontinuation from 
the study for any reason is always at the discretion of the investigators and subjects/subjects’ 
caregivers. If subjects/subjects’ caregivers expressed a desire to transition to commercial 
Trikafta™/Kaftrio™ once available in their country, they were allowed to do so. 
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response   
According to the Applicant’s response, in every case that a subject did not complete the study due to 
commercial drug availability, it was the subject’s or subject’s caregiver’s decision. The stopping 
criterion was thus primarily withdrawal at their own (or parent’s or legal guardian’s) request rather 
than commercial drug availability.  
Conclusion: issue resolved. 
Question 3 
The study included adults and adolescents from the parent study VX19-445-117 and VX20-445-126.  
a)  Please indicate the number of patients aged 12-18 years included in this study  
b)  Please indicate how many patients were recruited from study VX 117 and how many from study VX 
126 
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
The number of adult and adolescent subjects enrolled from parent Studies 117 and 126 are presented 
in Table 5. 
Table 5 Study 121 Enrolment by Parent Study and Age (Safety Set) 
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response   
The Applicant provided the requested data. The study included 27 subjects aged 12-18 years (31%). 
31 subjects (36%), of whom 10 aged 12-18 years, were recruited from parent study VX19-445-117.

55 subjects (64%), of whom 17 aged 12-18 years, were recruited from parent study VX20-445-126. 
The overview has been updated accordingly.  
Conclusion: issue resolved. 
Question 4 
Review of the narratives (One Subject) shows that this subject experienced the drug related ALT/AST 
related SAE with ALT and AST elevation up to ≥ 8ULN. This event is described as an event of “mild 
intensity”, but the Rapporteur considers that the severity should be changed to “severe”.  
a)  The applicant is asked to adjust the severity of this event.  
b)  Please also indicate if the treatment was permanently stopped, or if Kaftrio was re-introduced because 
of the commercial availability of the drug. If a rechallenge has occurred, please describe the results of 
the rechallenge.  
c)  The current SmPC section 4.8 only mentions that cases of treatment discontinuation due to elevated 
transaminases have been reported in the post marketing setting. As this case occurred during a study, 
an update to the SmPC might be necessary. Please find attached the SmPC with the proposed updates. 
After agreement of the wording for the SmPC, the MAH is requested for a commitment to submit a 
variation shortly after finalisation of the procedure.  
d)  The current SmPC section 4.4 already includes a comment on regular transaminase monitoring. This 
section must slightly be reworded to provide a clearer/stronger warning about the risk of drug induced 
elevated transaminases. Consequently, a recommendation in section 4.2.is proposed as well. Please 
find attached the SmPC with the proposed updates. After agreement of the wording for the SmPC, the 
MAH is requested for a commitment to submit a variation shortly after finalisation of the procedure.  
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
a)  As defined in Study 121 Protocol v2.0 Section 13.1.1.4, adverse event (AE) severity was assessed by 
the investigator in accordance with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
guidance (e.g., Grade 1 [mild] severity is described as “mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical 
or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated”). Vertex cannot adjust the severity of the 
AEs of alanine transaminase (ALT) increased and aspartate transaminase (AST) increased for one 
Subject as this conflicts with GCP guidelines for clinical trial execution. 
b)  Following the AEs of ALT increased and AST increased, this subject discontinued elexacaftor 
(ELX)/tezacaftor (TEZ)/ivacaftor (IVA) treatment in Study 121. There was no rechallenge during study 
participation with ELX/TEZ/IVA following the AEs of ALT increased and AST increased. The subject 
received the last dose of study drug on 31 July 2022. On 19 September 2022, the subject discontinued 
Study 121. 
c)  and d) Vertex agrees to update the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to more clearly 
address the risk of elevated transaminases as well as treatment discontinuations due to elevated 
transaminases; proposed changes are included in the attached SmPC. 
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response   
a)  The investigator assigned the event as “mild” referring Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) to assess the AEs. However, by using the same classification system, we consider that 
the severity might be under estimated. Considering that the subject received an AE induced 
intervention (liver biopsy), the event should have at least been classified as moderate. In addition, the 
liver biopsy showed sign of drug-induced liver injury. A drug-induced liver injury can be potential life

threatening if treatment is continued. Therefore, the classification as “severe” would align with the 
CTCAE classification.  
It is acknowledged that the Applicant cannot adjust the severity of the AEs as determined by the 
investigator. However, considering that the event was reported as serious, it could have been 
considered that the investigator might have underestimated the severity of this event.  
b)  The Applicant states that the study drug was not reintroduced to this subject during the study. During 
the study, no rechallenge test occurred.  
c)  And d) Applicant proposed changes to the SmPC that address the risk of elevated transaminases and 
events of elevated transaminases in clinical studies. With these changes, the Applicant provides a 
clearer/stronger warning about the risk of drug induced elevated transaminases and the occurrence of 
this AE in clinical trials.  
Conclusion: issue resolved. 
Question 5 
The applicant is asked to indicate if the LFT events are considered related or unrelated, and/or if they 
leaded to treatment discontinuation or treatment interruption, to align with the previously reported 
data in sections Drug related medication / SAE / Discontinuation / interruption etc.  
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
One subject (discontinued treatment due to elevated transaminase events and  another subject 
interrupted study drug due to elevated transaminase events. Outcome and the investigator’s 
assessment of relatedness for all treatment-emergent elevated transaminase events are presented in 
Table 6. 
Table 6 Elevated Transaminase Events During the TE Period (All Subjects Set) 
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response 
The Applicant provided an additional overview of the PT elevated transaminase events for two subjects, 
one of which led to treatment interruption and one which led to treatment discontinuation.  
Elevated transaminase levels are common in patients with CF. Therefore, elevated transaminase levels 
are not necessarily related to the study drug.  
The Rapporteur expected that the reported drug-related AST/ALT leading to an SAE of the first above 
subject (see question 4) would be of at least moderate to severe severity, also considering that it led 
to discontinuation of the drug treatment. However, in the initial study report, the reported case of 
increase ALT/AST was considered not related to treatment, although it led to treatment interruptions.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/569523/2023  
Page 16/19 
 
 
 
 
The Applicant clarified in response to question 4, why the treatment related SAE of AST/ALT increased 
experience by this subject was considered of mild intensity. In response to question 5, the Applicant 
provided an additional overview of the related and unlikely PT elevated transaminase events for three 
subjects. As shown by this table, the event of moderate intensity was experienced by another subject).  
A complete overview of the PT ALT/AST increased is provided in listing 16.2.7.2: a summary is 
provided in the table below :  
Table made by assessor based on listing 16.2.7.2.  
Overall, the Rapporteurs considers that 3 patients experienced a treatment related of increased 
AST/ALT, with all events being reported as “mild” by the investigator. Four events were considered as 
related and one additional event is considered as possibly related. 
As already mentioned in response to question 4, in one subject the severity might potentially have 
been underrated. As stated in question 4, one subject experienced an SAE of AST/ALT elevations of >8 
ULN. This event was considered to be related to treatment, which was confirmed with a liver biopsy. 
These observations led to a recommendation to provide a stronger warning about the risk of drug-
induced elevated transaminases, which resulted in an proposed update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of 
the SmPC.  
Conclusion: issue resolved. 
Question 6 
Please provide the total number of events blood bilirubin cases being at least possibly related to 
medication and the associated severity.  
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
There were 3 treatment-emergent events related to blood bilirubin that were assessed by the 
investigator as possibly related to study drug: 1 subject had an AE of hyperbilirubinemia and 1 subject 
had separate AEs of blood bilirubin increased and blood bilirubin unconjugated increased. All 3 events 
were assessed by the investigator as mild in severity.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/569523/2023  
Page 17/19 
 
 
 
 
There were no events related to blood bilirubin that were considered related to study drug. 
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response 
In 22 subjects elevated total bilirubin levels > ULN were measured and in 17 subjects elevated direct 
bilirubin levels were measured. 
Not all cases of elevated total bilirubin will be recorded as adverse event. According to listing 16.2.7.1 
a total of n=5 patients experienced a possibly related event of elevated bilirubin considered of mild 
intensity by the investigator. These events did not lead to a dose modification.  
Conclusion: issue resolved. 
Question 7 
Two subjects had a drug related event of CK increased. Please indicate the severity of the event. 
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
The 2 subjects with an AE of blood creatine phosphokinase increased that was assessed by the 
investigator as possibly related to study drug had events that were mild or moderate in severity, 
summarized below: 
•  Subject had an AE of blood creatine phosphokinase increased that was mild in severity; study drug 
dosing was not changed. 
•  Subject had an AE of blood creatine phosphokinase increased that was moderate in severity; study 
drug dosing was not changed. 
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response 
The Applicant provided the requested information. One of the two events was considered mild and the 
other moderate in severity. In both cases, study drug dosing was not changed.  
Conclusion: issue resolved. 
Question 8 
Please explain why not all patients underwent an ophthalmologic examination upon discontinuation of 
the trial  
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
Per Study 121 Protocol v2.0 Section 11.2.7, ophthalmologic examinations (OEs) were planned to be 
conducted only for the 27 subjects who were <18 years of age on the date of informed consent in a 
parent study. 
•  9 subjects had OEs conducted and included in the electronic data capture (EDC). 
•  3 subjects discontinued Study 121 to participate in another qualified Vertex study and had an OE 
conducted as part of the Screening Visit in that study; none of the subjects had an AE of cataract. 
•  2 subjects, who had previously participated in Study 445-117 (Study 117), had an OE as part of their 
Study 117 Week 48 Visit. These OEs were within the window of time that precluded the requirement of 
another OE in Study 121, per Study 121 Protocol v2.0 Section 11.2.7. 
•  13 subjects had an OE conducted at study discontinuation that were not entered in the EDC. Based on 
review of the source data and communication with the site investigators, all OEs were conducted per 
protocol and there were no treatment-emergent AEs of cataracts.

Assessment of the Applicant’s Response 
All 27 subjects aged 12-18 years underwent an OE, either at discontinuation of the study or within a 
window of time that precluded the requirement of another OE. For 18 subjects, this was not properly 
recorded in the study report and additional explanation was provided.

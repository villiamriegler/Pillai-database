Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in 
order to add a new warning, dose modification advice 
and description of the known ADR haemolytic 
anaemia based on an updated Drug Safety Report; 
the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce 
editorial updates in the English, Maltese, Romanian, 
French, Swedish and Italian product information. 
Moreover, the ATC code for alectinib is being 
updated from L01XE36 to L01ED03.

A.6 - Administrative change - Change in ATC 
Code/ATC Vet Code 
Cases of haemolytic anaemia have been reported in the 
post-marketing period, with severity of anaemia ranging 
from Grade 1 to Grade 3. No Grade 4 or Grade 5 (fatal) 
cases of haemolytic anaemia were observed in the clinical 
trials or in the post-marketing setting.  
If haemoglobin concentration is below 10 g/dL and 
haemolytic anaemia is suspected, Alecensa should be 
withheld and appropriate laboratory testing should be 
initiated. If haemolytic anaemia is confirmed, Alecensa 
should be resumed at a reduced dose upon resolution.

Product Characteristics.

Renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
19/05/2022

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Alecensa in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, 
Alecensa (alectinib) is removed from the additional 
monitoring list as a new active substance following five 
years of authorisation. 
Therefore, the statement that this medicinal product is 
subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow 
quick identification of new safety information, preceded by 
an inverted equilateral black triangle, is removed from the 
summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.

Leaflet and the RMP are updated in accordance.  
In addition, the CHMP, having considered the 
application as set out in the appended assessment 
report and on the basis of the evidence of 
compliance with the specific obligations submitted by 
the marketing authorisation holder, is of the opinion 
that the risk-benefit balance of the above mentioned 
medicinal product remains favourable. As all specific 
obligations laid down in Annex II have been fulfilled, 
pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 
507/2006, the CHMP recommends by consensus the 
granting of a Marketing Authorisation in accordance 
with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 
for the above mentioned medicinal product.

The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations through 
variation II/01 and having confirmed the positive benefit 
risk-balance, is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continue to be adequately 
and sufficiently demonstrated.  
Furthermore, in the framework of the variation II/01, the 
CHMP concludes that the remaining specific obligation for 
the Conditional Marketing Authorisation is fulfilled and 
recommends granting a Marketing Authorisation no longer 
subject to specific obligations.

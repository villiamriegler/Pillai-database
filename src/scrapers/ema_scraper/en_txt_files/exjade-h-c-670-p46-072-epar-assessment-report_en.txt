1.  Introduction 
On 11 October 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for deferasirox (EXJADE), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study CICL670A1402 : a Japanese surveillance study to confirm the long term (1 
year to 5 years) safety and efficacy of deferasirox dispersible tables when orally administered to 
Japanese patients with chronic iron overload in the clinical setting is a stand alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Exjade is brand name for  deferasirox presented as  dispersible tablets in 3 doses strengths: 125, 250 
and 500mg. The investigational drug was available as tablets at dosage strengths of 125 mg, 250 mg 
and  500  mg,  packaged  in  high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  bottles  with  an  induction  seal  and  child 
resistant closure. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Deferasirox (company research code: ICL670, DFX) is an orally active chelator that is highly selective 
for  iron  (III).  It  is  a  tridentate  ligand  that  binds  iron  with  high  affinity  in  a  2:1  ratio.  Deferasirox 
promotes  excretion  of  excess  iron,  primarily  in  the  feces.  Deferasirox  was  developed  by  Novartis  for 
the treatment of chronic iron overlo ad due to frequent blood transfusions (≥ 7 mL/kg/month of packed 
red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassemia major aged 6 years and older. It is also indicated for 
the  treatment  of  chronic  iron  overload  requiring  chelation  therapy  when  deferoxamine  therapy  is 
contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: 
  in   p e d ia t r ic   p a t ie n t s   w it h   b e t a   t h a la s s e m ia   m a jo r   w it h   ir o n   o v e r lo a d   d u e   t o   fr e q u e n t   b lo o d  
transfusions (≥ 7 mL/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
  in   a d u lt   a n d   p e d ia t r ic   p a t ie n t s   w it h   b e t a   t h a la s s e m ia   m a jo r   w it h   ir o n   o v e r lo a d   d u e   t o   in fr e q u e n t  
blood transfusions (<7 mL/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older, 
 in  a d u lt  a n d  p e d ia t r ic  p a t ie n t s  w it h  o t h e r  a n e m ia s  a g e d  2  y e a r s  a n d  o ld e r .  
Further it is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when 
deferoxamine  therapy  is  contraindicated  or  inadequate  in  patients  with  non  -  transfusion-dependent 
thalassemia syndromes aged 10 years and older.  
Deferasirox  was  first  registered on  02-Nov-2005  in the  United  States  and  subsequently  in  the  EU  via 
centralized procedure on 28-Aug-2006. Deferasirox is currently approved in over 100 countries.

2.3.2.  Clinical study  
CICL670A1402 : Special Drug use Observational study on Exjade dispersible tablets :  a 
Japanese surveillance study to confirm the long term (1 to 5 years) safety and efficacy of 
deferasirox under general practice in Japanese patients with chronic iron overload  
Description 
A post-marketing surveillance study was performed in Japan between the market launch of  Exjade in 
16  June  2008  and  May  24,  2016  (to  enroll  patients who  started  treatment  with  Exjade  no  later  than 
January 31, 2012) with two studies: 
•  EXJ-1-01:  drug  use  observational  study,  all  treated  patients  surveillance,  with  two  follow  up 
periods: from the start of treatment to 0.5 year with data recorded in the CRF01 and from 0.5 
to 1 year with data recorded in the CRF02 (CICL670A1401 – cf P46 – 071). 
•  EXJ-2-01 : special drug use observational study (CICL670A1402).  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The aim of this special drug observational study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of long-term use 
under  actual  use  conditions.  This  study  (EXJ-2-01)  is  being  conducted  in  subjects  who  have  been 
treated with Exjade starting in the drug use observational study (EXJ-1-01). 
Study design 
The study design is a drug use observational study after the market launch of Exjade in Japan (June 
16, 2008) until 24 May 2016. It concerns subjects who have been treated with Exjade starting in the 
drug use observational study (EXJ-1-01). 
Study population /Sample size 
Study A1402 was conducted in patients who were confirmed to be receiving treatment at the time of 
completion  of  the  6-month  drug  use  observational  surveillance  (Study  CICL670A1401)  with  a  1-year 
observation period, were planned to continue treatment with deferasirox, and were capable of having 
follow-up  continued.  For  Study  A1402,  a  targeted  sample  size  of  300  patients  as  those  continuously 
treated for 5 years was considered achievable. 
Treatments 
The  daily  dose  of  Exjade  was  14.3  ±  5.41  mg/kg/day  (mean  ±  S.D.  n=281),  showing  that  a  high 
percentage of subjects received a lower dose than the approved dose of 20 mg/kg/day. The duration of 
treatment ranged extremely widely (mean ± S.D., 1053.1 ± 519.51 days, n=317).

Outcomes/endpoints 
The  aim  is  to  obtain  a  description  of  adverse  reactions  (incidence,  seriousness,  timing,  outcome  and 
incidence by factor), as well as incidence of serious adverse reactions by factor, laboratory values, and 
adverse  events  of  interest  (renal  impairment,  hepatic  impairment,  gastrointestinal  disorder,  eye 
disorder,  hearing  impaired,  decreased  blood  cells,  leucocytoclastic  vasculitis,  hypersensitive  reaction, 
agranulocytosis), ferritin levels. 
Statistical Methods 
Among the pediatric population, efficacy was assessed with ferritin levels. Safety was monitored via 
adverse events (AE), and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). In addition, a statistical test for adverse drug 
reactions (ADR) was performed (Fisher's exact test and Mann- Whitney U test).

As  of  May  24,  2016,  689  subjects  have  been  enrolled  in  the  special  drug  use  observational  study 
following 1-year  treatment  in  the  drug  use observational  study  (EXJ-1-01).  CRFs  were  collected  from 
326 of the 689 subjects. Of the 326 subjects from whom the CRFs were collected, 320 subjects were 
included  in  safety  analysis,  excluding  a  total  of  6  subjects:  3  due  to  CRF  not  signed  and  3  who  did 
receive treatment period <365 days.  
Data from 323 CRF-01 (second year), 190 CRF-02 (third year), 129 CRF-03 (fourth year) and 93 CRF-
04 (5th year) were tabulated. 
Number of children: 3 patients aged under 15 years (0,94%) and 5 patients aged less than 20 years 
(1.56%). 
Efficacy results 
Ferritin levels before and after the start of treatment with deferasirox, were measured in 212 patients 
(efficacy analysis set). 
Overall,  the  mean±SD  (median)  change  in  ferritin  levels  in  212  patients  was  -704.62±4063.932  (-
908.35)  ng/mL,  with  a  proportion  of  patients  showing  decreased  ferritin  levels  of  68.9%  (146/212 
patients).  Although  large variations  were  noted,  serum  ferritin  levels  decreased,  despite the  fact  that 
75.0%  of  patients  were  receiving  lower  than  the  approved  20  mg/kg/day  dose,  and  the  majority 
(66.6%) of patients were receiving 1.7 to 8.3 units of blood per month prior to the start of deferasirox 
treatment. The mean ferritin levels had a larger decrease in this surveillance (Study A1402) than the 
drug  use  observation  surveillance  (Study  A1401),  in  which  the  mean  ±  SD  (mean)  change  in  ferritin 
levels was -292.90±5023.748 (-180.20) ng/mL.  
According to the MAH, this is most likely due to: (1) the period of exposure to deferasirox was longer 
in  this  surveillance  than  the  drug  use  observation  surveillance  and  (2)  patients  who  tolerated 
treatment well in the drug use observational surveillance were included in this surveillance 
Children <15 years-old and <18 years-old 
The mean±SD (median) changes in ferritin levels in pediatric patients <18 years and adult patients ≥ 
18  years  were  -2706.95 ± 365.928  (-2,706.95)  ng/mL  and  -688.84 ± 4088.019  (-907.00)  ng/mL, 
respectively.  Serum  ferritin  levels  decreased  in  both  patient  populations.  The  proportions  of  pediatric 
patients  <15  years  and  adult  patients  ≥  15  years  who  had  decreased  ferritin  levels  were  100%  (2/2 
patients) and 68.9% (144/209 patients), respectively. 
The ability of deferasirox to remove iron appeared to be superior in pediatric patients, but because 
ample size was very small, a meaningful comparison could not be made. 
CHMP’s comment 
Due to the small number of paediatric patients in the efficacy analysis set (n=2), no specific analyses 
of the efficacy in paediatric patients have been conducted.  
According to the MAH, a greater reduction in SF levels was observed in the special drug use 
observational study  (A1402) than in the drug observational use study (A1401), indicating that the 
efficacy was highlighted due to the increased exposure after long term treatment and the fact that 
patients enrolled well tolerated Exjade.

Safety results 
In summary, none of the 3 patients in the pediatric population of this study (<18 years and <15 years 
of age) had ADRs or serious ADRs reported. 
Two  patients  had  aplastic  anemia  as an  underlying  disease,  and  one  had  pure  red  blood  cell  aplasia. 
One  of  the  three  patients  reported  graft  versus  host  disease,  which  indicates  a  prior  bone  marrow 
transplant with curative intent. Although no ADRs were reported, it cannot be excluded that potential 
side  effects  of  the  study  drug  were  masked  by  the  many  confounders  in  this  patient.  In  one  patient, 
symptoms were reported as resolved and no longer requiring treatment with study drug at Year 4. This 
patient  was  treated  with  low  doses  of  deferasirox  during  the  4  years  of  observation  starting  at  7.5 
mg/kg/day in Year 2 and an average of 14.1 mg/kg/day. No ADRs or AEs were reported in this case, 
which could be explained by the known lower safety risk of deferasirox at lower doses. 
The  safety  experience  in  the  three  pediatric  patients  in  this  study  was  consistent  with  the  currently 
labeled  safety  profile  of  Exjade;  however,  the  low  number  of  pediatric  patients  do  not  allow  firm 
conclusions. 
CHMP’s comment 
Only 3 paediatric patients is included in the safety analysis set : one 11 years-old female patient (with 
aplastic  anemia)  who  has  been  treated  during  1418  days  at  mean  daily  dose  of  14.08  mg/kg  (study 
discontinuation  due  to  resolution  of  disease  symptoms)  ;  one  4  years-old  male  patient  (with  aplastic 
anemia)  who  has  been  treated  during  1826  days  at  mean  daily  dose  of  19.23  mg/kg  (completion  of 
study  –  He  experienced  disease  complications  (liver,  cardiac,  nervous  system))  and  a  13  years-old 
female patient (with PRCA) who has been treated during 658 days at mean daily dose of 27.1 mg/kg. 
In  this  latter  case,  medical  history  included  cholelithiasis,  congenital  hydrocephalus  and  bilateral 
inguinal  hernia.  On  day  631,  the  patient  experienced  SAEs  :  ALT/AST  and  GGT  increased  leading  to 
permanent  discontinuation  on  Day  658  due  to  acute  pancreatitis,  cholelithiasis,  urea  nitrogen 
increased, aggravation of chronic GVHD. SAEs were considered as not treatment related but related to 
concurrent conditions. The SAEs resolved and the patient discharged from hospital.  
None adverse reactions were reported in patients under 15 years (or under 18 year-old).  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This study is a special drug observational study (post marketing surveillance study) performed in Japan 
between the market launch of Exjade in 16 June 2008 and May 24, 2016. The aim of this study is to 
confirm the long term (1 to 5 years) safety and efficacy of Exjade under actual use conditions. 
No specific analysis of efficacy in paediatric patients has been performed as only 2 paediatric patients 
were included in the efficacy analysis set. Similarly for safety, children <15 years old account for only 
0.94%. No ADRs were reported in these 3 patients. 
Therefore,  this  observational  study  did  not  give  any  information  of  long  term  use  of  deferasirox  in 
children.  
No  changes  to  the  paediatric  information  of  the  current  deferasirox  SPC  is  proposed  based  on  these 
data.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
This study is a special drug observational study (post marketing surveillance study) performed in Japan 
between the market launch of Exjade in 16 June 2008 and May 24, 2016. The aim of this study is to 
confirm the long term (1 to 5 years) safety and efficacy of Exjade under actual use conditions. 
Overall, this observational study does not bring any new relevant information on efficacy and safety on 
the  long  term  use  in  children  as  children  <15  years-old  account  for  only  0.94%  of  the  studied 
population (3 paediatric patients in safety analysis). No ADRs were reported in these 3 patients.  
Based  on  the  data  provided  for  paediatric  population,  the  benefit-risk  assessment  for  deferasirox 
remains unchanged for the currently approved indications and no changes to the pediatric information 
of the current deferasirox SPC are proposed as a result of this surveillance.

4.  MS comments 
During the procedure we have received MS 1 and MS 2 comments. We have not received any 
comments from other MS:  
-  MS 1 agrees with the rapporteur’s conclusions and have no further comments. 
-  MS 2 comments :  
In general we can agree with the conclusions as stated by the Rapporteur for the above 
mentioned procedure. However, we would kindly ask you whether you have considered to 
provide an integrated report and discussion of the 3 current paediatric worksharing procedures, 
as it may facilitate decision-making regarding any amendments that might be needed in the 
SmPC for paediatric patients. 
CHMP’s comment 
After discussion with EMA, it was necessary to have 3 different assessment reports as the applicant 
submitted P46 071, P46 072 and P46 073 as three separate eCTD sequences (0144, 0145 and 0146 
respectively) on 17/10 for P46071 and P46 072 and on 20/10/2017 for P46 073. 
However, it could be highlighted that, in all 3 procedures, we are not recommending any PI changes.

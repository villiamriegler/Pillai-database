1.  Introduction 
On 17 February 2016, the MAH completed the study CIGE025E2306 i.e. a multicentre, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in 
patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine 
(H1AH) therapy. This study population included paediatric patients (≥12 years of age) and thus the 
data are submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the study (CIGE025E2306) is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Commercially available Xolair in Japan and Korea indicated for chronic idiopathic urticaria: 
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of CSU in adults and adolescents (12 years and 
above) with inadequate response to H1 antihistamine treatment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a clinical overview and final study report for CIGE025E2306 which is a multicentre, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
omalizumab in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who remain symptomatic despite H1 
antihistamine (H1AH) therapy. The study was conducted in Japan and Korea, and enrolled male and 
female patients (≥12 years of age). Four patients were younger than 18 years of age at randomisation.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Purpose 
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab compared with 
placebo, as an add-on to H1AH therapy in Japanese and Korean patients with CSU who remain 
symptomatic despite H1AH therapy. 
Objectives 
Primary objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of omalizumab 300 mg and/or 150 mg 
injected subcutaneously every 4 weeks in patients with refractory CSU receiving concomitant H1AH 
therapy with respect to a reduction from baseline in an itch severity score at Week 12, compared to 
placebo.

Secondary objectives included: 
Urticaria Activity Score-7, weekly hives score, Dermatology Life Quality Index, and safety. 
Demographics 
A total of 218 patients were randomized (73 patients to omalizumab 300 mg, 71 patients to 
omalizumab 150 mg, and 74 patients to placebo). In the age group 12 to <18 years, four patients 
were randomized (2 patients to omalizumab 300 mg, 1 patient to omalizumab 150 mg, and 1 patient 
to placebo). The three patients treated with omalizumab completed the study. The patient who 
received placebo discontinued from the study after Week 4 due to “Subject/guardian decision.” 
CHMP comment: 
Details about the demographics for these three patients are not given. 
Results 
Efficacy 
There was a decrease in all three patients treated with omalizumab in the itch severity score at Week 
12: 
Safety 
All AEs recorded in the paediatric patients were mild or moderate in severity and patients recovered 
without any specific actions taken. No AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in these 
patients. Causality was stated as “not suspected” in all cases. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Four patients 12-18 years of age were included in this study. Two of these were administered the 
therapeutic dose (300 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks), one a lower dose (150 mg) and 
the fourth placebo. A clear decrease in itch severity score was recorded for all patients treated with 
Xolair whereas the patient treated with placebo withdrew at week 4 due to “Subject/guardian 
decision”. The adverse events recorded were mild (moderate in one case of sinusitis during the follow 
up period) and not regarded treatment related.  
B/R remains unchanged.

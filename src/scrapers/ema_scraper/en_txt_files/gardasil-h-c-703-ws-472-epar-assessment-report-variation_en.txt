2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine, also referred to as 
qHPV vaccine, is a recombinant protein particulate (virus-like particle [VLP]) vaccine for the prevention of 
premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal) and cervical cancer causally related to certain 
oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types and genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to 
specific HPV types. Gardasil/Silgard is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of: 
• 
• 
premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal) and cervical cancer causally related to 
certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 
genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to specific HPV types 
QHPV vaccine was evaluated in over 20,000 subjects in pre-licensure clinical trials when administered in 3 
doses (0, 2, and 6 months). Gardasil/Silgard was licensed based on the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy 
of a 3-dose primary vaccination schedule.  
Efficacy of qHPV in girls and boys 9- to 15-year old has been inferred based on demonstration of non-inferior 
antibody responses to 3 doses of qHPV vaccine when compared with antibody responses in young adult 
women 16 to 45 years of age, the populations in which efficacy has been shown. Moreover, ongoing 
follow-up studies of vaccinated cohorts have so far seen no breakthrough cases of cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 caused by vaccine HPV types for up to 8 years for 3-dose recipients of qHPV vaccine and 
up to 9.5 years for recipients of a monovalent HPV 16 major capsid protein (L1) virus-like particles (VLP) 
vaccine. Similarly, there have not been breakthrough cases of vaccine type genital warts in follow-up studies 
in women or men who have received the 3-dose regimen of qHPV vaccine. Additionally, a long term 
follow-up study in young adolescents who were vaccinated at 9 to 15 years old (Protocol 018) has shown 
continuing effectiveness against high grade lesions after 8 years follow-up.  
Despite the extensive experience and database demonstrating the protective efficacy of a 3-dose HPV 
vaccine regimen, public health authorities in several geographic regions are currently interested in using a 
2-dose regimen to vaccinate young adolescents. Because there is no threshold level of antibody or other 
attribute of a vaccinated individual that can be characterized as a correlate of protection, the ultimate 
effectiveness and durability of alternative dosing regimens over the long term are unknown at this time. 
There are no specific data or text in the product labels to support these alternative regimens. Some 
governmental and public health authorities (e.g., Mexico, some Canadian provinces [Quebec and British 
Columbia]) have proposed a modified 3-dose regimen (0, 6, and 60 month) for girls 9 to 15 years of age. In 
May 2013 Quebec published their final decision to use 2 doses going forward. A third dose of vaccine at a 
60-month interval is still under discussion in some regions outside of Quebec and has not been fully 
implemented because its need has not been demonstrated. Notably, there are no data on the 
immunogenicity of a 0, 6, 60 month regimen. The third dose is being considered as a safety net against 
potential poor effectiveness of a 2 doses schedule of HPV vaccine. The Swiss Federal Vaccination Committee 
(CFV) and the Swiss Federal Public Health Office (OFSP) recommend 2 doses at an interval of 4 to 6 months 
for girls 11 to 14 years of age. A third dose could be used for a subsequent dose if this should prove 
necessary. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI, UK) requested that HPV vaccine 
manufacturers provide available data and perspectives regarding 2-dose schedules and discussed this topic. 
On a global basis, there are indications that the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of 
Experts (WHO SAGE) may also discuss this topic. Furthermore there is interest from public health authorities 
in Latin America. 
Investigations of reduced dosing regimens began just as the long term follow-up studies of young 
adolescents and sexually active women who received 3 doses of the qHPV vaccine were getting underway. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/66618/2014 
Page 3/17 
  
  
Data from these studies are becoming available at this time and show that 3 doses of vaccine provide 
durable protection against high grade disease and genital warts over 6 to 8 years following vaccination. 
Serological evidence also shows seropositivity against the HPV types in the vaccine at 8 and 9 years following 
vaccination in young adolescents and sexually active young women, respectively. These studies are 
ongoing. 
This variation application is supported by a clinical study entitled: A Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the 
Immunogenicity of a 2-Dose Schedule of the Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine in Younger 
Adolescents compared to a 3-Dose Schedule in Young Women. In addition, reference is made to published 
studies with different vaccination schedules of qHPV vaccine and the bivalent HPV vaccine. 
As a consequence of this data, the MAH proposed the update of the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to include an alternative 2-dose vaccination schedule in 
children aged from 9 to 13 years.  
2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects  
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study objectives: 
Primary Objective Part 1: To determine if antibody responses to HPV types 16 and 18 are non-inferior 
after a 2-dose paediatric regimen as compared to a 3-dose adult regimen of qHPV vaccination, with 
responses measured at Month 7. 
Primary Objective Part 2: To compare the serum antibody responses to HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 at months 
18, 24 and 36 after a 2-dose adolescent, 3-dose adolescent or 3-dose adult regimen of qHPV vaccine. 
Secondary Objectives Part 1: (1) To demonstrate that 2-doses of qHPV vaccine administered to 9 to 13 
year old females produced a serum antibody response to HPV 6 and 11 that was similar to the response seen 
in 16 to 26 year old females; (2) To evaluate the antibody response to HPV 16 and 18 in 9 to 13 year old 
females after a 2-dose versus a 3-dose qHPV regimen; (3) To evaluate seroconversion rates to HPV 6, 11, 
16 and 18 at 7 months; (4) To evaluate the memory B cell and T helper cell mediated immune response to 
qHPV vaccine in the 2-dose adolescent, 3-dose adolescent and 3-dose adult arms. 
Secondary Objectives Part 2: To evaluate the memory B cell and T helper cell mediated immune 
response to qHPV vaccine in the 2-dose adolescent, 3-dose adolescent and 3-dose adult arms. 
Study design:  
Post licensure, randomized, controlled, multi-centre study with 3 parallel groups in 2 age strata receiving 
open label qHPV vaccine. There were 3 study centres with approximately 1/3 of the total number of subjects 
enrolled at each site.  
Subjects aged 9 to 13 were randomly assigned to receive either 2 or 3 doses of qHPV vaccine and subjects 
aged 16 to 26 received 3 doses of qHPV vaccine. During Part 1 subjects in all groups had two 10 mL blood 
samples collected. Subjects at Centre 01 provided an additional 10 mL blood sample collected to facilitate 
additional immunoassay in that subset of participants. At the study visits on Month 0, Month 2 and Month 6 
all examinations and specimen collections took place prior to vaccination.  
Diagnosis/Inclusion criteria: Subjects who the investigator believed could and would comply with the 
requirements of the protocol may have enrolled in the study; females between, and including, 9 to 13 years 
(before 14th birthday) and 16 to 26 years of age (before 27th birthday) at the time of the first vaccination; 
ability to provide written informed consent (and assent where applicable); Healthy (stable chronic conditions 
acceptable) at Visit 1 (Month 0); Not pregnant (as determined by negative urine pregnancy test); Four or 
Assessment report

fewer sexual partners over lifetime as reported by subject (sexual intercourse defined as penetrative vaginal 
intercourse). 
Evaluation criteria: The primary immunogenicity endpoints are serum antibody concentrations to HPV 
(Types 16 and 18) at Month 7. The per-protocol immunogenicity (PPI) population will serve as the primary 
population for the analysis of serum antibody concentrations to the 4 HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 18). To be 
included in this population, subjects must: (1) Have seronegative (below the serostatus cut-off) results to 
each HPV type at study enrolment (according to the cLIA) and for women, have PCR negative results to each 
HPV type at study enrolment. Individuals who, at study enrolment, are positive for antibodies to any of HPV 
6, 11, 16, or 18 (according to the cLIA) or women who are PCR positive to HPV 6, 11, 16 or 18 will be 
excluded from the per-protocol analysis of vaccine response for the same antigen; (2) Have no other 
protocol violations at study enrolment or at specific visits. Generally, the protocol violators included subjects 
who did not receive all injections with the correct dose of the correct clinical material and/or did not adhere 
to all study procedures. 
Statistical planning and analysis: The primary endpoint analysis is an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to 
test differences in the Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of HPV 16 and 18 at Month 7. Non-inferiority of any 
treatment arm was declared if lower bounds of the multiplicity-adjusted 95% CIs of GMT ratios (study 
arm/control arm) for HPV16 and 18 were greater than 0.5.  
2.2.2.  Results 
Study Subjects/Patients and Data Sets Analysed 
The number of subjects by treatment group and vaccination number is as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
2 dose girls: 259 subjects had their first vaccination; 253 subjects had their second vaccination. 
3 dose girls: 261 subjects had their first and second vaccinations; 254 subjects had their third 
vaccination. 
3 dose women: 310 subjects had their first vaccination; 304 subjects have their second vaccination; 
301 subjects had their third vaccination. 
The primary analysis of immunogenicity was based on the HPV type-specific Per- Protocol Immunogenicity 
(PPI) population. HNRT (HPV Naive to the Relevant Type) immunogenicity population was used for 
supportive analyses.  
One exception to the PPI is Patient 2113. Her planned randomization was the 2 Dose Girls group but she 
received 3 doses so she is included in the 3 Dose Girls group. 
Exceptions were made to the protocol defined visit windows in order to match publication results (Dobson et 
al., JAMA 2013). The Month 18 visit window was changed relative to the study protocol from 504 ± 56 days 
to 547 ± 56 days, to more accurately reflect an 18 month interval. 
Demographic and Other Subject Characteristics 
The two groups of girls were well balanced with respect to the demographic and sexual history 
characteristics (not shown in this AR). 
Immunogenicity results 
Primary Objectives: Anti-HPV 16 and 18 2-Dose Girls / 3-Dose Women at Month 7 
In order to address the primary immunogenicity objectives of this study, anti-HPV 16 and 18 serum 
Competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) GMTs at Month 7 were compared between the 2-dose girls 
vaccine group and the 3-dose women vaccine group. A one-sided test of non-inferiority was conducted.

Table 2 presents the results of the per-protocol analysis. The estimated GMTs, fold-difference in GMTs, 
associated 95% confidence interval, and p-value for testing the null hypothesis of inferiority of anti-HPV 16 
and 18 responses are shown. The statistical criterion for non-inferiority with respect to GMT required that the 
lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the fold difference in anti-HPV 16 and 18 GMTs (2-dose girls 
/ 3-dose women) is greater than or equal to 0.5. The table shows that non-inferiority of the anti-HPV 16 and 
18 GMT response in the 2-dose girls vaccine group, relative to 3-dose women vaccine group, is 
demonstrated. In fact, the estimated Month 7 anti-HPV 16 and 18 GMTs were numerically higher in the 
2-dose girls vaccine group, than the 3-dose women vaccine group. Results are similar after adjusting for 
investigative site. Results are similar for the HPV Naive to the Relevant Type (HNRT) population. The same 
analysis was performed using the IgG assay; the fold-differences for types 16 and 18 were 2.13 (95% CI: 
1.81; 2.49) and 1.88 (95% CI: 1.58; 2.24) respectively. Conclusions do not change for the PPI and HNRT 
populations.

Secondary Objectives: Anti-HPV 6 and 11 2-Dose Girls / 3-Dose Women at Month 7 
In order to address the secondary immunogenicity objectives of this study, anti-HPV 6 and 11 serum cLIA 
GMTs at Month 7 were compared between the 2-dose girls vaccine group and the 3-dose women vaccine 
group. Table 3 presents the results of the per-protocol analysis. The estimated GMTs, fold difference in 
GMTs, and associated 95% confidence intervals for comparing the 2-dose girls vaccine group and the 3-dose 
women vaccine group for anti-HPV 6 and 11 responses are shown. The lower bound of the 95% confidence 
interval for the fold difference in anti-HPV 6 and 11GMTs (2-dose girls / 3-dose women) is greater than or 
equal to 0.5. In fact, the estimated Month 7 anti-HPV 6 and11 GMTs were numerically higher in the 2-dose 
girls vaccine group, than the 3-dose women vaccine group. Results are similar for the HPV Naive to the 
Relevant Type (HNRT) population. The same analysis was performed using the IgG assay; the 
fold-differences for types 16 and 18 were 1.96 (95% CI: 1.67; 2.31) and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.79; 2.41) 
respectively. Conclusions do not change for the PPI and HNRT populations.

immune responses to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 at Day 1, Month 7, Month 18, Month 24, and Month 36, with 
associated 95% CIs. The table shows that GMTs for HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18 peaked following the 2nd or 
3rd vaccine administrations in all vaccine groups at Month 7. The GMTs declined, as expected, during 
follow-up (Month 18, Month 24, and Month 36).

2.2.3.  Discussion 
The current variation intended to investigate the possibility to use a two-dose vaccination schedule in 
children aged from9 to 13 years of age instead of the current 3-dose schedule.  
The scientific basis consist of a comparison of immune responses in terms of cLIA titers between girls 9-13 
years of age receiving 2 doses a 0, 6 months to women 16-26 years receiving 3 doses. The comparison is in 
principle the same as the basis for using a 3-dose schedule in girls 9-15 years, since efficacy studies are not 
considered feasible in the younger population. The immune responses at month 7 are clearly non-inferior in 
both younger study groups (i.e. 2-dose and 3-dose) compared to women, which support the possibility to 
use a 2-dose schedule among girls 9-13 years of age. The duration of immune responses were studied up to 
36 months after dose 1. The decline of antibody titers was possibly slightly more rapid in 2-dose recipients 
compared to 3-dose recipients of the same age, but the clinical relevance of these relatively small 
differences is unknown. The numerical values were consistently higher in 2-dose girls compared to 3-dose 
women for all genotypes at all time-points. In contrast, the 0, 12 months schedule has not been compared 
within the same study to adult women, or 3-dose recipients of the same age.  
The immunogenicity follow-up in girls receiving 2 doses of qHPV vaccine is ongoing as part of the presented 
study, however clarifications were requested regarding the plans for immunogenicity follow-up. The 
follow-up studies of the cohort of girls who received a 2 dose (0, 6 months) in the “Randomized Clinical Trial 
to Assess the Immunogenicity of a 2-Dose schedule of the qHPV in Younger Adolescents compared to a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/66618/2014 
Page 11/17 
  
  
 
 
3-Dose Schedule in Young Women” are in progress. Young girls who were vaccinated with 2 doses of 
Gardasil in the original non-inferiority immunogenicity study will be contacted and asked to provide 5-year 
follow-up and serological samples for antibody testing. The MAH, in collaboration with the Principal 
Investigator commits to submitting a descriptive summary of these serology data when available, expected 
in June 2016. Further serological testing at Year 10 in this cohort of girls is expected, but will be highly 
dependent on the degree of loss to follow-up that occurs and future local HPV vaccine recommendations for 
this age group. 
Based on the available data, the CHMP endorsed the introduction of a 2-dose schedule (0, 6 months) in 
individuals 9 to and including 13 years of age. The CHMP recommended that the posology description 
(section 4.2 of the SmPC) should be done by age group with the 2-dose schedule presented first and the 
3-dose schedule presented as an alternative for the age group 9-13 years.  
During the assessment the CHMP highlighted the importance of a careful follow-up of girls receiving 2 doses 
of Gardasil and requested the MAH to provide the follow-up plans in the population that received the 2 dose 
scheduled. The MAH has been exploring options to assess the effectiveness of a 2-dose Gardasil schedule in 
girls 9 -13 years of age (the expected age indication for 2 doses in the EU) through observational vaccine 
effectiveness or vaccine impact studies.  
The MAH proposed to identify a country or region where these conditions could be met, with a preference for 
a European country. If a true vaccine effectiveness study (directly comparing the incidence of genital disease 
outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated girls) cannot be performed, for example because high vaccine 
uptake prevents having a valid concurrent unvaccinated comparison group, then an impact study, assessing 
the effectiveness of a 2-dose vaccine program on cervical disease outcomes at the population level, will be 
proposed. Regardless of whether a vaccine effectiveness or impact study will be conducted, priority will be 
given to using vaccination and outcome data that can be linked at an individual level. It is also important to 
note that countries/regions meeting the conditions for a 2-dose schedule assessment in girls may have 
started their HPV program with a 3-dose schedule in this age group, which may affect the baseline level of 
HPV disease burden at the time of implementation of a 2-dose schedule, as well as HPV disease transmission 
at the population level. 
The CHMP considered the proposed Post-Authorization Efficacy Study (PAES) acceptable; however it does 
not seem to be possible to predict a country that will continue to use qHPV vaccine for the entire study 
period. There may be periods when e.g. other HPV vaccine will be used depending on the national policies. 
It is expected that a 2-dose Gardasil schedule will be implemented. The vaccination registries should include 
the dates of vaccination so that number and timing of doses is available.  
In addition, if possible, a secondary objective could be the effectiveness against condyloma, as this is likely 
to be feasible to study at an earlier time point. The proposed primary outcome, CIN2+, is considered 
appropriate. A full assessment of the study synopsis will be made when the updated RMP is submitted. 
The MAH commits to regularly update the CHMP with the feasibility assessment of options for such a PAES 
within 6 months after EU approval of the 2-dose schedule variation in adolescents and then annually. The 
MAH will provide a preliminary synopsis of a proposed 2-dose PAES in an updated RMP at the time of the next 
PSUR submission. The full synopsis will be provided once a country/region is identified where such a PAES is 
confirmed to be feasible.

2.4.  Risk management plan 
The MAH did not submit an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure and this was 
deemed acceptable.  
2.5.  Changes to the Product Information 
Changes to the Product Information are presented as new text underlined and deleted text marked as 
strikethrough.  
During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the PI as described in section 2.2.3: 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Individuals 9 to and including 13 years of age 
Gardasil can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule (0.5 ml at 0, 6 months) (see section 5.1). 
If the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 6 months after the first dose, a third dose should 
always be administered. 
Alternatively, Gardasil can be administered according to a 3-dose (0.5 ml at 0, 2, 6 months) schedule. 
The second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose should 
be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within a 1-year 
period. 
Individuals 14 years of age and older 
Gardasil should be administered according to a 3-dose (0.5 ml at 0, 2, 6 months) schedule. 
The second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose should 
be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within a 1-year 
period. 
The use of Gardasil should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Gardasil in children below 9 years of age have not been established. No data are 
available (see section 5.1). 
It is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil complete the vaccination course 
with Gardasil (see section 4.4). 
The need for a booster dose has not been established.

Clinical studies 
Immune Responses to Gardasil using a 2-dose schedule in individuals 9-13 years of age 
A clinical trial showed that among girls who received 2 doses of HPV vaccine 6 months apart, antibody 
responses to the 4 HPV types, one month after the last dose were non-inferior to those among young 
women who received 3 doses of the vaccine within 6 months. 
At Month 7, in the Per Protocol population, the immune response in girls aged 9-13 years (n=241) who 
received 2 doses of Gardasil (at 0, 6 months) was non-inferior and numerically higher to the immune 
response in women aged 16-26 years (n=246) who received 3 doses of Gardasil (at 0, 2, 6 months).  
At 36 month follow-up, the GMT in girls (2 doses, n=86) remained non-inferior to the GMT in women (3 
doses, n=86) for all 4 HPV types. 
In the same study, in girls aged 9-13 years, the immune response after a 2-dose schedule was 
numerically lower than after a 3-dose schedule (n=248 at Month 7; n=82 at Month 36). The clinical 
relevance of these findings is unknown. 
Duration of protection of a 2-dose schedule of Gardasil has not been established. 
Package Leaflet 
3.   HOW GARDASIL IS GIVEN How to use Gardasil 
Gardasil is given as an injection by your doctor. Gardasil is intended for adolescents and adults from 9 years 
of age onwards. The person to be vaccinated will receive three doses of the vaccine. 
If you are from 9 to and including 13 years of age 
Gardasil can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule: 
- 
- 
If the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 6 months after the first dose, a third dose should 
First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: 6 months after first injection 
always be administered. 
First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: ideally 2 months after first injection 
Third injection: ideally 6 months after first injection 
Alternatively, Gardasil can be administered according to a 3-dose schedule: 
- 
- 
- 
If an alternate vaccination schedule is necessary, The second dose should be administered at least one 
month after the first dose and the third dose should be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. 
All three doses should be given within a 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more information. 
First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: 2 months after first injection 
Third injection: 6 months after first injection 
If you are from 14 years of age 
Gardasil should be administered according to a 3-dose schedule: 
- 
- 
- 
The second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose should be 
administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within a 1-year 
period. Please speak to your doctor for more information. 
It is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil complete the vaccination course with 
Gardasil. 
The person to be vaccinated should complete the three-dose vaccination course; otherwise the person to b 
vaccinated may not be fully protected. 
Gardasil will be given as an injection through the skin into the muscle (preferably the muscle of the upper 
arm or thigh). 
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines and solutions. 
If you forget one dose of to take Gardasil: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/66618/2014 
Page 15/17 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you miss a scheduled injection, your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose. 
It  is  important  that  you  follow  the  instructions  of  your  doctor  or  nurse  regarding  return  visits  for  the 
follow-up doses. If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your 
doctor for advice. When Gardasil is given as your first dose, the completion of the following two doses to 
complete  the  3-dose  vaccination  course  should  also  be  done  with  Gardasil,  and  not  with  another  HPV 
vaccine. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicineproduct, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template, which were reviewed 
and accepted by the CHMP. Minor linguistic changes were also endorsed. 
In addition, it was accepted to express the quantity of aluminium salt in milligrams instead of micrograms 
in order to harmonise with the bivalent HPV vaccines in section 2 of the SmPC, PL and Labelling. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
In the current variation the possibility to use a two-dose vaccination schedule in children aged from 9 to 13 
years of age instead of the current 3-dose schedule was evaluated. The scientific basis for the change 
consists of a comparison of immune responses in terms of cLIA titers between girls 9-13 years of age 
receiving 2 doses a 0, 6 months vs. women 16-26 years receiving 3 doses. The data presented indicate that 
the immune responses to 2 doses of Gardasil given to girls 9-13 years of age are at least as good as those 
in women 16-26 years old who were given 3 doses, which is the populations in which efficacy has been 
demonstrated. The importance of a stringent and careful follow-up of girls receiving 2 doses of Gardasil has 
been emphasised and is to be carried out in accordance with the follow-up for the 3-dose schedule in the 
same age group. In response to this CHMP request the MAH proposed a preliminary protocol synopsis for a 
PAES, which was considered acceptable. The MAH commits to update the CHMP with the feasibility 
assessment of options for such a PAES within 6 months after EU approval of the 2-dose schedule variation 
in adolescents and then each year after that. The full synopsis shall be provided once a country/region is 
identified where such a PAES is confirmed to be feasible. An updated RMP shall be submitted at the time of 
the next PSUR submission. 
Based on the available data, the CHMP endorsed the introduction of a 2-dose schedule (0, 6 months) in 
individuals 9 to and including 13 years of age. The benefit-risk balance for qHPV vaccines remains positive.   
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation(s) requested 
C.I.4 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality,

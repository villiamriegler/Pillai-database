4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Artesunate Amivas is indicated for the initial treatment of severe malaria in adults and children (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antimalarial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
It is recommended that Artesunate Amivas should be used to treat patients with severe malaria only 
after consultation with a physician with appropriate experience in the management of malaria.  
Posology 
Initial treatment of severe malaria with artesunate should always be followed by a complete treatment 
course with appropriate oral antimalarial therapy. 
Adults and children (birth to less than 18 years) 
The recommended dose is 2.4 mg/kg (0.24 mL of reconstituted solution for injection per kg body 
weight) by intravenous (IV) injection at 0, 12 and 24 hours (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After at least 24 hours (3 doses) treatment with Artesunate Amivas, patients unable to tolerate oral 
treatment may continue to receive intravenous treatment with 2.4 mg/kg once every 24 hours (from 48 
hours after start of treatment).   
Treatment with Artesunate Amivas should be stopped when patients can tolerate oral treatment. After 
stopping Artesunate Amivas, all patients should receive a complete treatment course of an appropriate 
oral combination antimalarial regimen.  
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).   
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).   
Paediatric population 
No dose adjustment is recommended based on age or weight (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Method of administration  
Artesunate Amivas is for IV administration only. The reconstituted solution should be administered as 
a slow bolus injection over 1-2 minutes. 
Artesunate Amivas must be reconstituted with the supplied solvent prior to administration. 
Because of the instability of artesunate in aqueous solutions the reconstituted solution must be used 
within 1.5 hours of preparation. Therefore, the required dose of artesunate should be calculated (dose 
in mg = patient’s weight in kg x 2.4) and the number of vials of artesunate needed should be 
determined prior to reconstituting the artesunate powder. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any other artemisinin antimalarial agent or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity 
Allergic reactions to intravenous artesunate, including anaphylaxis have been reported.  Other reported 
allergic reactions include urticaria, rash and pruritus (see section 4.8). 
Post-artesunate delayed haemolysis 
Post-artesunate delayed haemolysis (PADH) is characterised by decreased haemoglobin with 
laboratory evidence of haemolysis (such as decreased haptoglobin and increased lactate 
dehydrogenase) with onset at least 7 days and sometimes several weeks after initiating artesunate 
treatment. PADH has been reported to occur very commonly after successful treatment of severe 
malaria that commenced with IV artesunate in returning travellers. The risk of PADH may be highest 
in patients with hyperparasitaemia and in younger children. Patients should be monitored for evidence 
of haemolytic anaemia for 4 weeks after starting artesunate treatment. Spontaneous recovery from 
PADH usually occurs within a few weeks. However, cases of post-artesunate haemolytic anaemia 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severe enough to require transfusion have been reported. Since a subset of patients with delayed 
haemolysis after artesunate therapy have evidence of immune haemolytic anaemia, performing a direct 
antiglobulin test should be considered to determine if therapy, e.g. with corticosteroids, is necessary. 
See section 4.8.  
Reticulocytopenia 
The artemisinins have shown direct inhibitory effects on human erythroid precursors in vitro and 
inhibit bone marrow responses (especially red blood cell precursors) in animal models. Both animal 
preclinical data and human data from clinical trials have suggested that reversible reticulocytopenia 
occurs at least commonly in association with treatment with intravenous artesunate (see section 4.8). 
The reticulocyte count recovers after cessation of treatment.  
Malaria due to Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae or Plasmodium ovale 
Artesunate Amivas has not been evaluated in the treatment of severe malaria due to Plasmodium 
vivax, Plasmodium malariae or Plasmodium ovale. Available data indicates that it is effective against 
all Plasmodium species (see section 5.1). It does not treat the hypnozoite liver stage forms of 
Plasmodium and will therefore not prevent relapses of malaria due to Plasmodium vivax or 
Plasmodium ovale. Patients treated initially with artesunate for severe malaria due to P. vivax or P. 
ovale should receive an antimalarial agent that is active against the hypnozoite liver stage forms of 
Plasmodium.  
Infants aged less than 6 months 
There are insufficient clinical data to establish the safety and efficacy of Artesunate Amivas in infants 
below 6 months of age. Pharmacokinetic modelling and simulations indicate that after 2.4 mg/kg IV 
artesunate the dihydroartemisinin (DHA) plasma exposures in infants aged less than 6 months are 
likely to be higher than those in older infants and children (see section 5.2). 
Elderly 
There are insufficient clinical data to establish the safety and efficacy of intravenous artesunate in 
patients aged 65 years and older with severe malaria (see section 5.2). 
Information about excipients 
This medicinal product contains 193 mg sodium per the recommended single dose for a 60 kg adult, 
equivalent to 9.6 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. As 
the first and second doses are recommended 12 hours apart, on days when two doses are given in a 
24 hour period, then the dose would be 386 mg sodium per day, equivalent to 19.2 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No clinical drug-drug interactions studies have been conducted with Artesunate Amivas. 
Effect of other medicinal products on artesunate and/or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) 
After intravenous administration, artesunate is converted to DHA by esterases and by CYP2A6.  DHA 
is converted to inactive glucuronide conjugates primarily by UGT1A9.  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of intravenous artesunate with strong inhibitors of UGT enzymes (e.g. axitinib, 
vandetanib, imatinib, diclofenac) may increase plasma exposures to DHA. Co-administration should 
be avoided if possible. 
Co-administration of Artesunate Amivas with UGT inducers (e.g. nevirapine, ritonavir, rifampicin, 
carbamazepine, phenytoin) may decrease DHA exposures, leading to a reduction in, or loss of, 
efficacy. Co-administration should be avoided.  
Effect of artesunate and/or DHA on other medicinal products 
Limited data from in-vitro studies and from clinical drug-drug interaction studies with oral artesunate 
and/or oral DHA have indicated that DHA induces CYP3A and inhibits CYP1A2. Caution is advised 
when co-administering intravenous artesunate with substrates of CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 that have 
narrow therapeutic windows.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is limited clinical experience with the use of Artesunate Amivas in the first trimester of 
pregnancy. A risk to the fetus cannot be excluded. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). The use of Artesunate Amivas in the first trimester is therefore not recommended 
unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus.  
A moderate amount of clinical data on pregnant women (between 300-1000 pregnancy outcomes) 
indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of artesunate when given IV in their second or third 
trimester. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Artesunate Amivas during 
the second or third trimester of pregnancy. 
Pregnancy registry  
A pregnancy registry has been set up to monitor all pregnancies and their outcomes following 
treatment with Artesunate Amivas. 
Breast-feeding 
DHA, a metabolite of artesunate, is present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of 
artesunate or DHA on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The benefits of breastfeeding to 
mother and infant should be weighed against potential risk from infant exposure to DHA through 
breast milk. 
Fertility 
No fertility data are available in humans.  
Animal studies have reported effects on the male reproductive organs, however studies on female rats 
show no effect on fertility (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Patients 
should be warned not to drive or use machines if they feel tired or dizzy.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse drug reaction reported in clinical trials has been anaemia. While anaemia 
occurs very commonly in patients with severe malaria as a result of the disease and effective 
treatment, anaemia that was not dose-related was also reported in healthy subjects in clinical 
pharmacology studies with IV artesunate. 
Post-Artesunate Delayed Haemolysis (PADH) has been reported very commonly following effective 
treatment of severe malaria with IV artesunate in travellers and in children (see section 4.4). 
Reticulocytopenia that resolves after completion of treatment with IV artesunate occurs commonly or 
very commonly (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse events considered at least possibly related to artesunate are listed below by body system, 
organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common 
(1/100-1/10), uncommon (1/1000-1/100) and unknown (frequency cannot be determined) (Table 1).

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In cases of suspected overdosage symptomatic and supportive therapy should be given as appropriate.  
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiprotozoals, artemisinin and derivatives, ATC code: P01BE03. 
Mechanism of action 
The antimalarial mechanism of action of artesunate is generally thought to depend upon activation 
involving iron-mediated cleavage of the endoperoxide bridge of DHA to generate an unstable organic 
free radical followed by alkylation, where the free radical binds to malarial proteins leading to 
destruction of parasite membranes.  
In-vitro activity 
Available in-vitro data indicate that artesunate 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) are broadly 
comparable for P. falciparum and for the other Plasmodium species that cause malaria in humans (P. 
vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, P. knowlesi). 
Artemisinin resistance 
Decreased susceptibility to artesunate and other artemisinins, manifesting clinically as slower rates of 
parasite clearance is associated with mutation in the K13 gene, which encodes the parasite’s Kelch 
propeller protein Kelch13.  
Clinical efficacy 
In SEAQUAMAT (South East Asian Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial), an open-label, multicentre 
trial conducted in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Myanmar, 1461 patients (1259 adults and 202 
children <15 years) with severe falciparum malaria were randomised to initial intravenous treatment 
with artesunate or quinine until oral medication could be tolerated. Artesunate was administered at 
2.4 mg/kg IV at 0, 12 and 24 hours and then every 24 hours. Quinine was given IV at 20 mg/kg over 4 
hours, followed by 10 mg/kg thrice daily over 2-8 hours. Mortality in the intention to treat population 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was 14.7% (107 of 730) in the artesunate group compared to 22.4% (164 of 731) in the quinine group, 
a reduction in the odds of death adjusted by study site of 40% (95% CI: 21%, 55%; p=0.0002). 
Mortality in patients with severe malaria in the artesunate group was 19.8% (101 of 509) compared to 
28.1% (152 of 541), a reduction in the odds of death adjusted by study site of 35% (95% CI: 13%, 
52%; p=0.003).  
AQUAMAT (African Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial) was an open-label multicentre trial in which 
African children aged < 15 years (n=5425) with severe falciparum malaria were randomised to 
parenteral artesunate or parenteral quinine using the same dose as in SEAQUAMAT. Mortality in the 
intent to treat population was 8.5% (230 of 2712) in the artesunate group compared to 10.9% (297 of 
2713) in the quinine group, a reduction in the odds of death adjusted by study site of 25% (95% CI: 
10%, 37%; p=0.0022). Mortality in children with severe malaria in the artesunate group was 9.9% 
(226 of 2280) compared to 12.4% (291 of 2338) in the quinine group, a reduction in the odds of death 
adjusted by study site of 23% (95% CI: 7%, 36%; (p=0.0055). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following intravenous administration of artesunate as a bolus injection over 1-2 minutes, the 
pharmacokinetics of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin in plasma are shown in Table 2.

2017-3492 
Artesunate and DHA distribute into the extracellular body fluid. DHA is approximately 93 % 
protein-bound in patients with uncomplicated malaria infection. Erythrocytes infected with Plasmodia 
have been reported to contain very high DHA concentrations compared to plasma levels (e.g. 300-fold 
vs. mean plasma concentrations). 
Biotransformation 
Artesunate is converted to DHA by cytochrome 2A6 and blood esterases. In human liver microsomal 
incubations of DHA, DHA-glucuronide was the only metabolite found. In urine from patients, α-
DHA-β-glucuronide (α-DHA-G) and a variable amount of the tetrahydrofuran isomer of α-DHA-G 
was identified. DHA itself was present only in very small amounts. 
Elimination 
Artesunate is very rapidly eliminated from blood (within a few minutes) via conversion to DHA. DHA 
is eliminated from blood within a few hours after an intravenous dose, mainly via urinary excretion of 
glucuronides.

Special Populations 
Elderly  
There are no pharmacokinetic data available after intravenous artesunate dosing in patients aged 65 
years or older with severe malaria (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with impaired renal function. Clinical trial data 
from patients with severe malaria and accompanying renal impairment at start of treatment indicate 
that no dose modifications are necessary. 
Hepatic impairment 
No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with impaired hepatic function. Clinical trial data 
from patients with severe malaria and accompanying hepatic impairment at start of treatment indicate 
that no dose modifications are necessary. 
Paediatric population 
There are limited PK data on the use of IV artesunate in neonates and infants. Physiologically-based 
PK modelling and simulations predict that plasma exposures are likely to be higher in infants below 
6 months of age compared to infants aged more than 6 months (see section 4.4).  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Artesunate was negative in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, an in vitro Chinese hamster 
ovary chromosome aberration assay, an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay using oral 
administration, and in an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats when administered intravenously. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with artesunate. 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study IV administration of artesunate to rats at between 
1-2 times the clinical dose (based on body surface area comparisons) did not affect female fertility, or 
early embryonic development. Oral administration of artesunate during organogenesis in rats, rabbits, 
and monkeys induces a dose-dependent increase in embryolethality and fetal malformations (including 
cardiovascular, brain, and/or skeletal) at 0.3 to 1.6-times the clinical dose based on body surface area 
(BSA) comparisons. Although animal reproduction studies in several species have demonstrated fetal 
harm from oral and IV administered artesunate and other artemisinin class drugs, the clinical relevance 
of the animal data is uncertain. 
Studies in the literature indicate that artesunate oral administration in the male rat can cause a dose and 
duration dependent effect on the epididymis and testes with reversible decreases in the production of 
viable sperm at near clinical doses. No such effects were noted in rats or dogs in 28-day Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) studies conducted using IV dosing.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Artesunate Amivas is and what it is used for 
Artesunate Amivas contains the active substance artesunate. Artesunate Amivas is used to treat severe 
malaria in adults and children.  
After treatment with Artesunate Amivas your doctor will complete your treatment for malaria with a 
course of anti-malarial medication that can be taken by mouth. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Artesunate Amivas  
Do not use Artesunate Amivas 
- 
if you are allergic to artesunate, to any other antimalarial treatment that contains an artemisinin 
(e.g. artemether or dihydroartemisinin) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
You may develop anaemia, a reduced number of red blood cells, or other blood changes after 
treatment with this medicine. Some changes to numbers of blood cells can occur while you are being 
treated and usually recover after stopping treatment for malaria. However, some individuals develop 
severe anaemia that can occur up to several weeks after completing treatment for malaria. In most 
cases, the anaemia recovers without any specific treatment. In a small number of cases the anaemia 
may be severe and require blood transfusion. Your doctor will carry out regular blood tests that can 
include a direct antiglobulin test to determine if treatment, e.g. with corticosteroids, is necessary and 
monitor your recovery for 4 weeks after you have completed your treatment for malaria. It is 
important you attend appointments for these check-ups. Talk to your doctor for more information. 
Other medicines and Artesunate Amivas 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes medicines not on prescription. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some medicines should not be taken with artesunate because they could reduce its effect on malaria. 
Some examples include: 
• 
• 
• 
rifampicin (to treat bacterial infections) 
ritonavir, nevirapine (anti-HIV medication) 
carbamazepine, phenytoin (to treat epilepsy) 
Some medicines may increase blood levels of artesunate and may increase the risk of side effects. 
Some examples include: 
•  diclofenac (to treat pain or inflammation) 
• 
axitinib, vandetanib and imatinib (used in the treatment of certain cancers)   
Artesunate may increase or decrease the blood levels of some other medicines. Your doctor will advise 
you on taking any medicines during artesunate treatment. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, you 
should talk to your doctor before being given this medicine.  
Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risk of taking Artesunate Amivas during pregnancy. 
Use in the first trimester of pregnancy is not recommended unless your doctor decides that the benefit 
of treatment for you outweighs the risk to your unborn child. In the later stages of pregnancy, you 
should only take Artesunate Amivas if your doctor feels that there are no suitable alternative 
medicines.  
If you are or become pregnant during treatment with this medicine, the doctor will report your 
pregnancy to the manufacturer, who is keeping a record in order to understand any effects that the 
treatment may have on the pregnancy and the baby. 
Traces of this medicine may be present in your breast milk. It is not known if these could have any 
effect on a breastfed baby. If you are planning to breastfeed, discuss with your doctor whether the 
benefits of breastfeeding to you and your baby outweigh the potential risk.  
Driving and using machines 
You should not drive or use machines if you feel tired or dizzy. 
Artesunate Amivas contains sodium 
This medicine contains 193 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each single dose. 
This is equivalent to just under 10 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for 
an adult.  
As the first and second doses are recommended 12 hours apart, this would supply 386 mg sodium 
(nearly 20 %of your maximum daily intake). 
3. 
How Artesunate Amivas is given 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure.  
This medicine will be given to you by a slow injection directly into a vein. Your doctor or nurse will 
inject this medicine for you. 
The dose of the medicine you are given is based on your weight and your doctor or nurse will work 
out the right amount to give you. The recommended dose is 2.4 mg for each kg of body weight. The 
dose per kg is the same for adults and children of all ages.   
24 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You will be given at least three doses of Artesunate Amivas, each dose given 12 hours apart. After 
three doses, if you still cannot take medicines by mouth, you will be given one dose of Artesunate 
Amivas every 24 hours (once a day) until you are able to take a different malaria treatment by mouth. 
It is very important that you complete a full course of antimalarial treatment taken by mouth after you 
have had at least three doses of Artesunate Amivas by injection. 
If you are given more Artesunate Amivas than you should 
As this medicine will be given to you in a hospital, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. Tell 
your doctor if you have any concerns. Signs of an overdose include seizures, dark coloured stools, a 
blood test showing low blood cell counts, weakness, fatigue, fever and nausea. Your doctor will help 
to treat these symptoms if you are given too much of this medicine.  
If a dose of Artesunate Amivas is forgotten   
As this medicine will be given to you in a hospital, your doctor or nurse will manage your treatment 
and it is unlikley a dose will be forgotten.  Should a dose be delayed, your doctor or nurse will give the 
required dose at the earliest opportunity and continue to give future doses 12 or 24 hours apart.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

Other sources of information 
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu 
<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Preparation and Administration 
The required dose of Artesunate Amivas should be calculated prior to reconstitution:  
Dose mg = patient’s weight in kg x 2.4 
Only the required number of vials of Artesunate Amivas should be reconstituted when preparing the 
dose. Remaining unopened vials can be stored in the carton ready for use at the next scheduled dose.  
To reconstitute, withdraw 11 mL of the supplied solvent (0.3 M sodium phosphate buffer) with a 
needle and syringe. Inject into the vial containing the artesunate powder (the final concentration of 
artesunate is 10 mg/mL when reconstituted). Swirl gently for 5 to 6 minutes until the powder is fully 
dissolved. Do not shake. 
Visually inspect the solution within the vial to ensure that no visible particles remain and there is no 
discolouration. Do not administer if solution is discoloured or contains visible particles.  
Inject the reconstituted drug solution IV as a slow bolus over 1-2 minutes. Do not administer via 
continuous IV infusion. 
The recommended dosage schedule is at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours, then once daily until alternative oral 
anti-malarial medication can be tolerated. 
Artesunate Amivas also contains 193 mg sodium per the recommended single dose in a 60 kg adult, 
equivalent to 9.6 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. As 
the first and second doses are recommended 12 hours apart, on days when two doses are given in a 
24 hour period, then the dose would be 386 mg sodium per day, equivalent to 19.2 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Storage of reconstituted Artesunate Amivas solution 
Once reconstituted, the Artesunate Amivas solution should be administered within 1.5 hours of 
preparation. Discard any unusued solution in accordance with local guidelines.

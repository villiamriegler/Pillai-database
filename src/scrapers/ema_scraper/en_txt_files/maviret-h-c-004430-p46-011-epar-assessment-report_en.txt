1.  Introduction 
On 21 December 2021, the MAH submitted the final clinical study report for the completed paediatric 
study  P20-105  for  Maviret  (glecaprevir/pibrentsavir)  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
No SmPC update for Maviret is proposed by the MAH in relation to this study. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
No information has been provided by the MAH regarding the context of submission of this final study 
report  for  study  P20-105  -  Real  World  EviDEnce  of  the  EffecTIveness  and  Clinical  Practice  Use  of 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir in Adolescents 12 to < 18 Years of Age with Chronic Hepatitis C Genotypes 1 
to 6 in Russian Federation (DETI-2). It is in the Rapporteur’s understanding that this study is a stand-
alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The MAH did not provide study drug in this study. It is stated that the drug was used according to the 
approved  product  label  and  reimbursement  criteria and  was  prescribed  by  the  physician  under usual, 
current  medical  practice  and  was  clearly  separated  from  the  decision  to  include  the  patient  in  the 
study.  Therefore,  no  information  has  been  provided  on  the  pharmaceutical  formulation  used  in  the 
study.  
Otherwise,  Maviret  is  available  as  100/40mg  film-coated  tablets  and  50mg/20mg  coated  granules  in 
sachet. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
study  P20-105  -  Real  World  EviDEnce  of  the  EffecTIveness  and  Clinical  Practice  Use  of 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir in Adolescents 12 to < 18 Years of Age with Chronic Hepatitis C Genotypes 1 
to 6 in Russian Federation (DETI-2) 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
Study P20-105 is a prospective, multi-center observational study in patients with CHC genotypes 1 to 
6 receiving the oral GLE/PIB regimen. The prescription of a treatment regimen was at the discretion of 
the  physician  in  accordance  with  local  clinical  practice  and  label,  and  was  made  independently  from 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

this  observational  study  and  was  preceding  the  decision  to  offer  the  patient  the  opportunity  to 
participate in this study. 
Participants 
Adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age chronically infected with HCV receiving GLE/PIB were offered the 
opportunity to participate in this study during a routine clinical visit at the participating sites. 
Study design 
Patients were observed for the duration of the GLE/PIB therapy and for up to 12 weeks after treatment 
completion.  Follow-up  visits,  treatment,  procedures,  and  diagnostic  methods  followed  physicians' 
routine clinical practice. The observational study period entailed the following data collection schemes: 
•  8-week  treatment  regimen:  three  visits  (baseline,  end  of  treatment,  sustained  virological 
response at 12 weeks [SVR12]) 
•  12-week treatment regimen: three visits (baseline, end of treatment, SVR12) 
•  16-week treatment regimen: three visits (baseline, end of treatment, SVR12) 
Study duration 
The inclusion period was approximately 6 months, and the observational period of the study was from 
baseline visit until 12 weeks post treatment for each patient. 
The  observational  period  for  patients  receiving  8  weeks  of  GLE/PIB  was  approximately  20  weeks  (8 
weeks  treatment  and  12  weeks  post-treatment  observation);  for  patients  receiving  12  weeks  of 
GLE/PIB  the  observational  period  was  approximately  24  weeks  (12  weeks  treatment  and  12  weeks 
post-treatment observation); and for patients receiving 16 weeks of GLE/PIB the observational period 
was approximately 28 weeks (16 weeks treatment and 12 weeks post-treatment observation). 
Objectives 
The primary objective was: 
- 
To describe the effectiveness of GLE/PIB in HCV-infected adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age 
in routine clinical practice 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
- 
To  describe  in  routine  clinical  practice  the  effectiveness  of  GLE/PIB  by  subpopulations  of 
interest:  mono-HCV 
infected  and 
co-infected  with  HCV/HIV  adolescents,  HCV 
genotype/subgenotype,  cirrhotic  and  noncirrhotic  patients,  treatment-experienced  (prior 
treatment  with  pegIFN  (or  IFN),  and/or  RBV  and/or  sofosbuvir  [PRS])  and  treatment-naïve, 
adolescents  who  use  drugs  and  non-drug  users,  as  evidenced  by  SVR12  after  the  end  of 
treatment.

Results 
Baseline demographics: 
A  total  of  99  patients  with  CHC  enrolled  at  7  clinical  sites.  The  core  population  (CP),  defined  as  all 
patients  enrolled  in  the  study  and  receiving  GLE/PIB,  who  had  started  the  treatment  combination 
recommended in the current local label for their disease characteristics, was used to describe the main 
baseline  characteristics.  One  patient  was  excluded  from  the  CP  because  GLE/PIB  had  not  been 
administered  in  accordance  with  the  local  product  label.  The  average  age  in  the  CP  was  15.08  ±  1.8 
years.  
A total of 60 female (60/98, 61.22%) and 38 male (38/98, 38.78%) patients were included in the CP. 
There were 97 Caucasian patients (97/98, 98.98%) and 1 Asian patient (1/98, 1.02%). 
Of  the  99  enrolled  patients,  92  (92.93%)  received  8  weeks  of  therapy,  and  7  (7.07%)  received  16 
weeks of therapy. No patient was assigned to 12 weeks of therapy. 
Overall, 45 (45.45%) patients were co-infected HCV/HIV. The majority of patients had HCV genotype 1 
(50.51%)  or  genotype  3  (39.39%).  None  of  the  patients  were  diagnosed  with  cirrhosis,  although 
patients with cirrhosis were allowed to be enrolled. There were 90 treatment-naïve patients (90.90%) 
and 9 PRS-experienced patients (9.09%). None of the patients were DAA-experienced. In the study, 2 
patients  (2/99,  2.02%)  used  recreational  drugs;  1  patient  was  an  active  user  and  1  patient  was  a 
former user. The rest of the patients had never used recreational drugs. 
At baseline, the quantitative HCV RNA test was performed in 74 patients (74/98, 75.51%); all 74 were 
positive.  The  qualitative  HCV  RNA  test  was  performed  in  60  patients  (60/98,  61.22%);  59  of  which 
were positive. One patient had a negative qualitative test, but a positive quantitative test. There were 
36 patients who underwent both quantitative and qualitative tests. The analysis of HIV viral load was 
performed in 43 patients (43/98, 43.88%). The average value was around 1897.72 copies/mL. 
Efficacy results: 
All 99 enrolled patients completed the study.  
The  core  population  with  sufficient  follow-up  data  (CPFSU)  was  chosen  to  describe  the  primary 
endpoint. During the statistical analysis, 6 patients were excluded from the CPFSU: 3 patients due to 
lack of SVR test result, neither quantitative nor qualitative; 2 patients dropped out of the study before 
12 weeks; and 1 patient due to study drug not administered in accordance with the local label during 
the treatment period. 
The  effectiveness  of  therapy,  SVR12,  with  GLE/PIB  was  96.77%  (90/93  patients  from  the  CPFSU 
achieved  SVR12),  among  which  8  weeks  therapy  had  been  prescribed  to  83  patients  and  16  weeks 
therapy  to  7  patients.  Virological  failure  was  reported  in  3  patients  (3/93,  3.23%  did  not 
achieve  SVR12),  all  the  three  patients  with  virological  failure  were  co-infected  with 
HCV/HIV: 
-  All 3 of them were treatment naïve and received therapy for 8-weeks. 
- 
all 3 patients were HIV-positive with stage 4 , of whom 2 patients had stage 4a and 1 patient – 
Stage 4b, and received therapy a combination of lamivudine + tenofovir + dolutegravir.

- 
Two  patients  had  HCV  genotype  1  (1  patient  with  genotype  1a,  1  patient  with  genotype  1 
unspecified)  and  liver  fibrosis  stage  F0  and  1  patient  had  unknown  HCV  genotype  and  liver 
fibrosis stage F1.  
-  One patient was an active drug user; others had never used recreational drugs. 
Overall,  50  patients  with  mono-HCV  infection  (50/50,  100.00%)  and  40  patients  coinfected  with 
HCV/HIV (40/43, 93.02%) achieved SVR12. 
In  the  CP,  23  patients  (23/98,  23.47%)  had  a  concomitant  disease.  Of  the  33  total  concomitant 
diseases  reported,  the  most  frequently  reported  were  the  following:  other  specified  diseases  of  the 
gallbladder  (3/33,  9.09%),  unspecified  anemia  (2/33,  6.06%),  other  specified  disorders  of  the  brain 
(2/33, 6.06%), myopia (2/33, 6.06%) and gastritis and duodenitis (2/33, 6.06%). With the exception 
of HIV, no patient received concomitant therapy for these conditions. 
No data were collected for the adherence to the prescribed GLE/PIB regimen; hence, adherence rates 
could not be analysed. 
In  the  CP,  the  number  of  patients  who  were  using  health  resources  related  to  HCV  during  treatment 
(30/98 patients, 30.61%) decreased compared to baseline (55/98, 56.12%). At the end of treatment, 
the number of patients who were using health resources related to HCV (51/98, 52.04%) increased to 
almost that of baseline. 
Safety Results 
Throughout the study, a total of 7 AEs were reported. There were no SAEs. All 7 AEs were reported as 
mild  in  severity  with  a  reasonable  possibility  of  being  related  to  the  study  drug.  All  7  AEs  were 
identified  in  treatment-naïve  patients,  who  were  not  drug  users.  AEs  were  almost  evenly  distributed 
between patients with HCV mono-infection (3/7, 42.86%) and HCV/HIV co-infection (4/7, 57.14%). 
The  majority  of  AEs  (4/7,  57%)  were  in  nervous  system  disorders  system  organ  class  (SOC): 
dizziness,  dysgeusia,  headache,  and  somnolence.  The  remainder  of  the  AEs  were  2  (2/7,  28.57%)  in 
gastrointestinal  disorders  SOC  (nausea  and  vomiting),  and  1  AE  of  fatigue  (1/7,  14.29%;  general 
disorders and administration site conditions SOC). 
MAH’s conclusions 
The  MAH  concluded  that  GLE/PIB  treatment  HCV  was  associated  with  high  effectiveness  and 
tolerability. Almost 97% of patients (90/93) achieved SVR12. Overall, 3 HCV/HIV co-infected patients 
in the study did not achieve SVR12 due to virological failure. According to the MAH, GLE/PIB was well 
tolerated in adolescent patients and demonstrated a favorable safety profile, consistent with the safety 
profile established in adults. The benefit-risk of GLE/PIB is unchanged and no update to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics has been proposed as a result of the data obtained during this study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  MAH  submitted  the  final  clinical  study  report  of  an  observational  paediatric  study  in  adolescents 
aged  to  12  to  18  years  of  age  conducted  in  Russia  Federation  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of 
glecaprevir/pibrenstavir  (GLE/PIB)  in  routine  clinical  practice.  In  this  study,  GLE/PIB  were  prescribed 
and used according to current local label and patients were observed for the duration of the GLE/PIB 
therapy and for up to 12 weeks after treatment completion.  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

A  total  of  99  patients  were  enrolled  patients  in  this  study.    The  mean  age  of  enrolled  patients  was 
15.08 ± 1.8 years. Around half of patients were infected with HCV genotype 1 and 39% were infected 
with genotype 3. None of them had a diagnosis of cirrhosis at baseline. Of interest nearly 45.45 % of 
them (n=45) were co-infected with HIV. The high majority (90%) were naïve of treatment, 9% were 
treatment-experienced  (with  IFN,  and/or  RBV  and/or  sofosbuvir),  none  of  them  received  other  DAA-
including  regimens.  There  was  no  available  information  on  the  levels  of  HCV  RNA  levels  at  baseline. 
The average value for HIV viral load for 43/45 co-infected patients was 1897.72 ± 9259.93 copies/mL.  
Of  the  99  enrolled  patients,  92  (92.93%)  received  8  weeks  of  therapy,  and  7  (7.07%)  received  16 
weeks of therapy. 
Among the 99 enrolled patients, six patients were excluded from the analysis for the reasons detailed 
above. The SVR12 was reached in nearly 97% of patients (90/93), which is overall close to what was 
reported in other studies. In terms of safety, no particular concern was raised in this study, only 7 non 
serious AEs were collected including dizziness, dysgueusia, headache, somnolence, nausea and fatigue.  
Of  note,  there  were  three  virological  failures,  all  reported  in  HCV-HIV  co-infected  patients.  All  three 
patients  were  treatment  naïve  and  had  received  therapy  for  8-weeks.  Two  were  infected  with  HCV 
genotype  1,  the  genotype  for  the  third  patient  is  not  known.  Among  them,  one  patient  was  current 
active user of recreational drugs. Antiretroviral medications were lamivudine/tenofovir/dolutegravir for 
all three, for which no particular drug-drug interactions with negative impact on exposure to GLE/PIB 
are expected. It is unknown whether these patients were adherent or not since no data on observance 
was  finally  collected  in  this  study.  Moreover,  data  on  HCV  RNA  or  any  potential  substitutions  at 
baseline  that  could  have  impacted  GLE/PIB  efficacy  are  lacking,  making  difficult  to  explore  the 
potential causes of inefficacy. Finally, the absence of any data in terms of adherence and in terms of 
other sources of PK variability that could have influenced GLE/PIB exposures (other concomitant drugs 
for  example)  renders  all  the  more  difficult  to  contextualize  the  cases  of  virological  failures  and  reach 
definitive conclusions.  
In  the  Phase  3  EXPEDITION-2  study  conducted  in  153  HCV  and  HIV-1  co-infected  adults  with  or 
without  compensated  cirrhosis,  it  was  shown  that  the  presence  of  HIV-1  co-infection  did  not  impact 
efficacy,  subjects  with  HCV/HIV-1  co-infection  having  similar  rates  of  SVR12  as  observed  in  the  HCV 
mono-infected subjects. As a result, the administration scheme recommended for GLE/PIB in HIV co-
infected  subjects  does  not  differ  from  that  of  HCV  mono-infection.  This  approach  has  been  taken  up 
and  currently  reflected  in  Therapeutic  Guidelines  as  AASLD  or  EASL.  In  DORA-1  and  -2  studies 
performed respectively in 47 adolescent (aged 12 years to less than 18 years) and 80 children aged 3 
years  to  less  than  12  years  and  paediatric  studies,  there  was  a  limited  number  of  HIV  co-infected 
paediatric patients (4% and 1% respectively). However, it is not expected that HIV co-infection could 
have an impact on GLE/PIB efficacy in paediatric population that would have not been observed up to 
date in adult population. 
All in all, and taking into account the above considerations and notably the difficulty of contextualizing 
the  three  cases  of  virological  failures  reported  in  this  real  life  study,  we  concur  with  the  MAH’s 
conclusion  that  the  benefit/risk  balance  of  Maviret  is  unchanged  and  that  no  SmPC  update  is 
necessary.

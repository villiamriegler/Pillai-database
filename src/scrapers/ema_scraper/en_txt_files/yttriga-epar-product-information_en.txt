1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Yttriga radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution. 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
1 ml sterile solution contains 0.1-300 GBq Yttrium (90Y) on the reference date and time 
(corresponding to 0.005-15 micrograms of Yttrium [90Y]) (as Yttrium [90Y] chloride). 
Each 3ml vial contains 0.1-300 GBq, corresponding to 0.005-15 micrograms of Yttrium (90Y), at 
reference date and time. The volume is 0.02-3 ml.  
Each 10ml vial contains 0.1-300 GBq, corresponding to 0.005-15 micrograms of Yttrium (90Y), at 
reference date and time. The volume is 0.02-5 ml.  
The theoretical specific activity is 20 GBq/microgram of Yttrium (90Y) (see section 6.5). 
Yttrium (90Y) chloride is produced by decay of its radioactive precursor Strontium (90Sr). It decays by 
emission of beta radiation of 2.281 MeV (99.98 %) of maximal energy to stable Zirconium (90Zr). 
Yttrium (90Y) has a half-life of 2.67 days (64.1 hours). 
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

4.3  Contraindications 
Do not administer Yttriga directly to the patient. 
Yttriga is contraindicated in the following cases: 
- 
Hypersensitivity to Yttrium (90Y) chloride or to any of the excipients 
Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products are contraindicated in the following case: 
- 
Established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.6) 
For information on contraindications to particular Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared 
by radiolabelling with Yttriga refer the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the 
particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The contents of the vial of Yttriga is not to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for 
the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates. 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in 
designated clinical settings and receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations 
and appropriate licences of the competent authorities. 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety 
and pharmaceutical quality requirements. 
For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled 
medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal 
product to be radiolabelled. 
Particular care should be taken when administering radioactive medicinal products to children and 
adolescents (from 2 to 16 years old). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies of Yttrium (90Y) chloride with other medicinal products have been performed, 
because Yttriga is a precursor solution for radiolabelling medicinal products. 
For information concerning interactions associated with the use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal 
products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to 
be radiolabelled. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and after treatment. 
Pregnancy 
Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products are contraindicated in established or suspected pregnancy or 
when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
Before administering a radioactive medicinal product to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration 
should be given to whether the investigation could be reasonably delayed until the mother has ceased 
breast-feeding. If the administration cannot be delayed, a lactating mother should be advised to stop 
breast-feeding.

Further information concerning the use of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products in pregnancy 
and breast-feeding is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to 
be radiolabelled. 
Fertility 
Further information concerning the use of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal concerning fertility is 
specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Effects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by Yttrium (90Y)-labelled 
medicinal products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the 
medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Possible adverse reactions following the intravenous administration of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled 
medicinal product prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga, will be dependent on the specific medicinal 
product being used. Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. For each patient, exposure 
to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely clinical benefit. The activity administered 
must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably achievable bearing in mind the 
need to obtain the intended therapeutic result. 
Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of 
hereditary defects. 
The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and 
mutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the 
disease itself. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The presence of free Yttrium (90Y) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of Yttriga 
will lead to increased bone marrow toxicity and haematopoietic stern cell damage. 
Therefore, in case of an inadvertent administration of Yttriga, the radiotoxicity for the patient must be 
reduced by immediate (i. e. within 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca-
 DTPA or Ca-EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body. 
The following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use Yttriga for labelling of 
carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes: 
- 
- 
Ca-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or 
Ca-EDTA (Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) 
These chelating agents suppress yttrium radiotoxicity by an exchange between the calcium ion and the 
yttrium due to their capacity of forming water soluble complexes with the chelating ligands (DTPA, 
EDTA). These complexes are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 g of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3 – 4 minutes or 
by infusion (1 g in 100 – 250 ml of dextrose, or normal saline). 
The chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is 
circulating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval > 1 hour does 
not preclude the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency. 
Intravenous administration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours. 
In any case the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions 
immediately taken if there is evidence of damage to the blood marrow. 
The toxicity of the free Yttrium (90Y) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body 
during therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code:  V10X. 
The pharmacodynamic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by 
radiolabelling with Yttriga, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal 
product to be radiolabelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the 
particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by 
radiolabelling with Yttriga, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal 
product to be radiolabelled. 
In the rat, following intravenous administration, Yttrium (90Y) chloride is rapidly cleared from the 
blood. At 1 and 24 hours, blood radioactivity decreases from 11.0 % to 0.14 % of the administered 
activity. The two main organs where Yttrium (90Y) chloride distributes are the liver and bones. In the 
liver, 18 % of the injected activity is taken up 5 min after injection. Liver uptake decreases then to 
8.4 % 24 hours after injection. In bone, percentage of injected activity increases from 3.1 % at 5 min 
to 18 % at 6 hours and then decreases with time. Faecal and urinary elimination is slow: about 31 % of 
the administered activity is eliminated in 15 days. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The toxicological properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling 
with Yttriga prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be 
radiolabelled. 
There are no data available on the toxicity of Yttrium (90Y) chloride nor on its effects on reproduction 
in animals or its mutagenic or carcinogenic potential.

Incompatibilities 
Radiolabelling of medicinal products, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates, 
with Yttrium (90Y) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities. 
It is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc, used for the preparation of the radiolabelled 
medicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only 
syringe needles (for example, non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to 
minimise trace metal impurity levels.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS 
Before use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked. Activity may be measured using an 
ionisation chamber. Yttrium (90Y) is a beta pure emitter. Activity measurements using an ionisation 
chamber are very sensitive to geometric factors and, therefore, should be performed only under 
geometric conditions which have been appropriately validated.

Usual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected. 
The vial should never be opened and must be kept inside its lead shielding. The product should be 
aseptically withdrawn through the stopper using sterilised single use needle and syringe after 
disinfecting the stopper. 
Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, complying with the requirements of Good 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Practice, in order to maintain the sterility of Yttriga and to maintain 
sterility throughout the labelling procedures. 
The administration of radioactive medicinal products creates risks for other persons from external 
radiation or contamination from spills of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in 
accordance with national regulations must therefore be taken. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

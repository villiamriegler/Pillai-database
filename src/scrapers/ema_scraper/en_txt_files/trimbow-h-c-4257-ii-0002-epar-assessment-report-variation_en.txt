order to add the results  of two Phase III  studies  (Triple  7 and Triple  8): 
Triple  7 (CCD-05993AA1-07) is a multinational,  multicentre,  randomised,  open-label,  active-controlled, 
26-week, 2-arm, parallel  group study to evaluate the non-inferiority  of fixed combination  of 
beclometasone dipropionate  plus  formoterol fumarate plus  glycopyrronium  bromide administered  via 
pressurised  metered dose inhaler  (pMDI)  (CHF 5993) versus (vs.) fixed  combination of 
fluticasone  furoate plus  vilanterol  administered  via  dry powder inhaler  (DPI)  (Relvar®) plus 
tiotropium bromide (Spiriva®)  for the treatment of patients  with Chronic Obstructive  Pulmonary 
Disease (COPD). 
Triple  8 (CCD-05993AA1-08) is a 52-week, double  blind,  double dummy, randomized, multinational, 
multicentre,  2-arm parallel  group,  active controlled clinical  trial  of fixed combination  of beclometasone 
dipropionate  plus  formoterol fumarate plus  glycopyrronium  bromide administered  via pMDI  (CHF 5993) 
versus indacaterol/glycopyrronium  (Ultibro®)  via DPI  in  patients  with Chronic 
Obstructive  Pulmonary Disease (TRIBUTE)

TRIMBOW  (hereafter  also  referred  to  as  CHF  5993  pMDI)  is  a  triple  combination  of  an  inhaled 
corticosteroid  (ICS),  and  a  long-acting  beta2  agonist  (LABA),  and  a  long-acting  muscarinic  receptor 
antagonist  (LAMA).  The  product  is  a  fixed  dose  combination  of  Beclometasone  dipropionate  (BDP), 
formoterol 
fumarate  (FF)  and  Glycopyrronium  bromide  (GB).  TRIMBOW 
is 
formulated  as  a 
hydroxyfluoroalkane  (HFA)  solution  to  be  delivered  via  a  pressurised  metered  dose  inhaler  (pMDI)  with  a 
nominal  dose  per  actuation  of  BDP  100  mcg (87 mcg delivered dose), FF 6 mcg (5 mcg delivered dose), 
and  GB  12.5  mcg  (9  mcg  delivered  dose).  The  doses  of  BDP  and  FF  are  the  same  as  used  in  the  dual 
combination  of  BDP/FF  (Foster®)  which  has  already  been  licensed  for  the  treatment  of  COPD  in  all 
European  Countries. 
Assessment report  
EMA/910019/2019 
Page 6/62 
 
  
  
 
The  European  Commission  (EC)  granted  a  marketing  authorisation  valid  throughout  the  European  Union 
for TRIMBOW  on 17 July 2017. 
The approved indication  is: 
“Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD)  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a  long-acting 
beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention  of exacerbations see section 5.1)”. 
The posology is two inhalations  of TRIMBOW  87/5/9 micrograms twice daily. 
The  main  clinical  studies  supporting  the  approval  of  TRIMBOW  were  study  TRIPLE  5  (TRILOGY) and study 
TRIPLE  6  (TRINITY),  both  52-week  active  controlled  studies  in  high  risk  COPD  patients  (FEV1   less  than 
50%  predicted,  symptomatic  at  screening  despite  treatment  as  evidenced  by  a  COPD  assessment  test 
[CAT] score of 10 or above, and with at least one documented moderate to severe COPD exacerbation in 
the  year  prior  to  study  participation.  Study  TRIPLE  5  compared  TRIMBOW  with  a  fixed  combination  of 
BDP/FF (Foster® 100/6 pMDI) whereas study TRIPLE 6 compared TRIMBOW with tiotropium and the open 
triple  combination of BDP/FF (Foster®) + tiotropium. 
The MAH is  now applying  for an extension of the indication  as follows: 
“Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) (for effects on symptoms control and prevention  of exacerbations see section 5.1).” 
The  extension  of  indication  is  primarily  based  on  data  from  Study  TRIPLE  8  (TRIBUTE)  that  compared 
TRIMBOW  with  a  fixed  combination  of  IND/GB  (Ultibro  Breezhaler®)  over  52  weeks  in  subjects  with 
COPD  using a primary endpoint of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbation rate over 52 weeks. Additional 
revisions  are  based  on  data  from  Study  TRIPLE  7  (TRISTAR)  evaluating  the  non-inferiority  of  TRIMBOW 
compared  with  the  open  triple  combination  of  Fluticasone/Vilanterol  (Relvar® Ellipta®) + Tiotropium over 
26 weeks in subjects with COPD.  
2.2.  Non-clinical  aspects 
No new Non-clinical  data have been submitted  in  this application,  which  was considered  acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental  risk assessment 
There  is  no  change  of  the  environmental  risk  assessment  by  this  variation.  It  was  considered  that  the 
only  impact  of  the  updated  indication  could  be  on  the  market  penetration  factor  (FPEN)  which  is  used  in 
the  equation  to  calculate  the  predicted environmental concentration (PEC). However, since the FPEN used 
to  calculate  the  original  PEC  was  based  on  the  entire  population  of  COPD  patients,  the  change  is 
considered  not  to  have  any  impact  on  this  factor  nor  on  the  PEC  previously  calculated.  Therefore,  the 
original  assessment still  applies. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical  aspects 
Based  on  the  data  submitted  within  the  initial  MAA  considering  already  the  entire  population  of  COPD 
patients,  the  new/extended  indication  does  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in  environmental  exposure 
further  to the use of BDP.

2.2.3.  Conclusion  on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no updated data submitted  in this  application,  which  is acceptable.   
2.3.  Clinical  aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  proposed  extension  of  indication  is  primarily  based  upon  data  from  one  pivotal  phase  IIIb  study 
TRIPLE  8 and the supporting,  phase IIIb  study TRIPLE  7. 
Data  characterising  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  three  active  components  of  TRIMBOW,  their  pharmaco-
kinetic  interactions,  the  pharmacokinetics  in  special  populations  and  potential  drug-drug  interactions  were 
included  in  the  original  submission  supporting  the  first  marketing  authorisation  application  for  TRIMBOW. 
No  new  pharmacology/ pharmacokinetic data were part of the present submission, which is acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
GCP

Tabular  overview of clinical  studies   
Table  2: Phase IIIb  studies  performed  by the MAH in  support  of the type II variation 
2.3.2.  Discussion and conclusions  on clinical pharmacology 
No  updated  data  have  been  provided  in  this  application.  Overall,  the  clinical  pharmacology  properties  of 
three  active  components  of  TRIMBOW  have  been  appropriately  described  in  the  previous  applications. 
This  is acceptable  by CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical  efficacy 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical  development programme of TRIMBOW (hereafter also referred to as CHF 5993 pMDI) in COPD 
which  was  the  basis  for  the  original  marketing  authorisation  issued  by  the  European  Commission  in  July 
2017  included  three  phase  II  (studies  GLYCO  2,  TRIPLE  3  and  CARSAF),  one  phase  IIb  (study  TRIPLE 9) 
and two pivotal efficacy  and safety phase III  clinical  studies  (studies TRIPLE  5 and 6). 
Results  of two new phase IIIb  studies  (TRIPLE  7 and TRIPLE  8) are now submitted by the MAH.  
Support  for  the  extension  of  the  initially  authorised  indication  to  all  adult  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe  COPD  mainly  comes  from  the  52-week,  randomised,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  active 
controlled  study  TRIPLE  8  comparing  TRIMBOW  with  a  fixed  combination  of  a  LABA  (indacaterol)  and  a 
LAMA  (GB)  without  inhaled  corticosteroid.  The  primary objective of this study was to provide evidence by 
testing  whether  triple  therapy  with  ICS/LABA/LAMA  is  superior  to  dual  bronchodilator  therapy  with  a 
LABA/  LAMA  combination  in  terms  of  preventing  moderate  to  severe  COPD  exacerbation  episodes  over 
one year. 
Assessment report  
EMA/910019/2019 
Page 9/62 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Main  objective  of  study  TRIPLE  7 was to demonstrate that TRIMBOW is non-inferior to extemporary triple 
therapy  (fixed  combination  of  fluticasone  and  vilanterol  plus  tiotropium)  in  terms  of  the  St.  George’s 
Respiratory  Questionnaire  (SGRQ) total score at week 26 as a measure of quality of life.   
In  accordance  with  the  MAH,  efficacy  outcomes  of  this  study  are considered supportive evidence and not 
contributing  relevant  new  knowledge  to  this  type  II  variation  as  a consequence of the study design which 
substantially  differs  from  that  of  other  phase  III-IIIb  studies,  namely  by  the  open-label treatment and the 
shorter  total  treatment  duration  of  26  weeks  only  (thereby  not  preventing  seasonal  influences  on  the 
exacerbation rate).  
Therefore  in  the  remainder  of  this  section,  efficacy  results  of  study  TRIPLE  7  will  be  kept  brief,  to  the 
point and addressing  the essential  aspects only. 
2.4.2.  Main study TRIPLE  8 
Title  of Study  
A  52-week,  double  blind,  double  dummy,  randomized,  multinational,  multicentre,  2-arm  parallel  group, 
active  controlled  clinical  trial  of  fixed  combination  of  beclometasone  dipropionate  plus  formoterol 
fumarate  plus  glycopyrronium  bromide  administered  via  pMDI  (CHF  5993)  versus  indacaterol  / 
glycopyrronium  (Ultibro®)  via  DPI  in  patients  with  Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary  Disease  (Study 
Number: CCD-05993AA1-08, Eudra-CT Number: EudraCT no. 2014-001704-22). 
•  Study design 
Individual  study  participation  lasted  for  about  54 weeks and comprised the following eight (8) investigator 
site on-visits as presented  below and in

Figure  1: 
−  Pre-screening  visit  (Visit  0,  V0)  within  no  more  than  seven  days  prior  to  screening,  performed  in 
order  to  obtain  written  informed  consent,  also  for  restrictions  to  be  observed  prior  to  the 
screening  visit; 
−  Screening  visit  (Visit  1,  V1)  to  assess  a  patient’s  preliminary  eligibility  for  inclusion  into  the  study, 
followed  by  a  2-week  open-label  run-in  period  (treatment  with  IND/GB  (85/43µg/day)  and 
salbutamol  pMDI  or terbutaline  DPI  as rescue medication); 
−  Randomisation  visit  (Visit 2,  V2)  at  week  0  (W0)  when  a  patient’s  final  eligibility  was  confirmed 
and eligible  subjects randomised in  a 1:1 ratio to receive for the next 52 weeks either 
CHF 5993 pMDI, 2 puffs twice daily or matching placebo (total daily nominal dose of 400/24/50µg 
BDP/FF/GB) 
or 
IND/GB  DPI,  1  capsule  once  daily  or  matching  placebo  (total  daily  nominal  dose  of  85/43µg 
IND/GB) 
−  Subsequent  visits  were  performed after 4 weeks (V3), 12 weeks (V4), 26 weeks (V5), 40 weeks 
(V6) and 52 weeks (V7) of treatment. 
Throughout  study  participation  (i.e.  during  the  run-in  and  the  double-blind  treatment  periods),  patients 
were  requested  to  complete  on  a  daily  basis  a  validated  digital  diary  (DIARYpro)  in  order  to  record 
randomised  medication  intake,  permitted  rescue  medication  use  (salbutamol  pMDI  or  terbutaline  DPI), 
and EXACT-PRO questionnaire  data.

Study participants 
In  order to be eligible,  patients  had to meet the following  main inclusion  criteria: 
−  Male  or  non-pregnant  female,  ≥40 years  of  age,  current  or  former  smokers,  smoking  history  of 
>10 pack years; 
−  Diagnosis  of  severe  or  very  severe  airflow  limitation  as  per  GOLD  update  2014  (post-
bronchodilator  FEV1 <50% of predicted  normal; post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7); 
−  Symptomatic at screening  (CAT score ≥10); 
−  Documented  history  of  at  least  one  moderate  to  severe  exacerbation  in  the  year  prior  to 
screening  (i.e.  prescription  of  systemic  corticosteroids  and/or  antibiotics,  COPD-triggered  visit  to 
emergency department or hospitalisation); 
−  Under  dual  treatment  (ICS/LABA,  ICS/LAMA  or  LABA/LAMA)  or  LAMA  monotherapy (but not triple 
therapy) for at least two months prior to screening. 
The presence of any the following  excluded  a patient  from trial  participation  (key exclusion criteria): 
−  Current  clinical  diagnosis  of  asthma  or  physician-judged  need  for  an  oral  or  inhaled  corticosteroid 
therapy for the disorder; 
−  Known  respiratory  disorder other than COPD which in the opinion of the investigator may interfere

Table  3: Study treatments (Study TRIPLE 8) 
Patients  who  were  used  taking  previous  COPD  pMDI  medications  via  a  spacer  were requested to use the 
AeroChamber Plus™  for administration  of the study medication.   
Salbutamol  pMDI  or  terbutaline  DPI  were  permitted  for  use  as  rescue  medication  and  prescribed  / 
purchased  locally.  The  maximum  doses  allowed  for  salbutamol  and  terbutaline  were  8  and  4  puffs  per 
day,  respectively.  The  Investigator  had  to  be  contacted  in  case  the  patient’s  need  for  rescue  medication 
exceeded the maximum doses allowed for more than 2 consecutive days. 
Objectives 
Primary  objective: 
To  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over  IND/GB  (Ultibro®)  in  terms  of  moderate  and 
severe chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation rate over 52 weeks of treatment. 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
To  evaluate  the  effect  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  on  other  lung  function  parameters,  patient’s  health  status 
and clinical  outcome measures; 
To assess the safety and the tolerability  of the study treatments.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The  TRIPLE  8  study  had  a  single  primary  outcome,  i.e.  the  rate  of  moderate-to-severe  COPD 
exacerbations over 52 weeks of treatment. 
Definition:  A  COPD  exacerbation  was  defined  as  “A  sustained  worsening  of  the  patient’s  condition 
(dyspnoea,  cough  and/or  sputum  production/purulence),  from  the  stable  state  and  beyond  normal  day-
to-day  variations,  that  is  acute  in onset and necessitates a change in regular medication in a patient with 
underlying  COPD  that  includes  prescriptions  of  systemic  corticosteroids  and/or  antibiotics  or  need  for 
hospitalisation.”  Exacerbations were classified as moderate or severe as per EMA/Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP) guidelines  definitions: 
•  Moderate: exacerbations that required  treatment with  systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics; 
•  Severe: exacerbations that required  hospitalisation  or resulted  in  death. 
Any  unscheduled  visit  at  any  healthcare  institution  (e.g.  emergency  department,  pneumological  division 
or  physician)  was  also  classified  to  be  an  exacerbation,  provided  systemic  corticosteroids  and  or 
antibiotics  were  prescribed  (moderate  severity);  if  in  addition  the  episode required a stay of >24h, it was 
considered  as hospitalisation  and therefore classified  as severe. 
The  recognition  of potential COPD exacerbations by the investigators was supported by the daily report of 
worsened  symptoms  through an electronic diary and completion of the EXACT questionnaire. According to 
the  clinical  study  report,  investigators  and  site  personnel  were  notified  by  electronic  means  when  the 
EXACT score “changed beyond the normal day-to-day variability”. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  calculated  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over  the  active 
reference  treatment  (Ultibro®)  in  terms  of  the  moderate  and  severe  COPD  exacerbations  rate  over  52 
weeks of treatment. Based on a log-normal distribution for  the time to drop-out (estimated drop out rates 
of  13%,  16.5%,  and 20% at weeks 12, 26 and 52), an overdispersion of 0.56, and an exacerbation rate 
in  the  reference  arm  equal  of  0.90,  a  total  of  1534  evaluable  patients  (767  patients  per  arm)  was 
expected  to  provide  sufficient  statistical  power (85%)  to  detect  a  rate  ratio  of  0.80  between  CHF  5993 
pMDI  and the reference treatment at a two-sided significance  level  of 0.05. 
Since  each  subject  with  a  follow-up  of  non-null  duration  provided  a  contribution  to  the  analysis,  all 
randomised  subjects  were  considered  to  be  evaluable,  irrespective  of  whether  they  withdrew  from  the 
study prematurely.   
Moreover,  approximately  20%  of  patients  randomised  were  expected  to  suffer  from  very  severe  airflow 
limitation  (i.e.  post-bronchodilator FEV1 at screening  < 30% of predicted  normal value). 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  groups  by  central  balanced  block  randomisation  scheme, 
stratified  by  country  and  severity  of  airflow  limitation  (post-bronchodilator  FEV1  categories  <30% 
predicted  or  30%  to  <50%  predicted) in accordance with a randomisation list generated by an interactive 
response technology system. 
Blinding (masking) 
Patients,  investigators,  site  staff,  and  sponsor  personnel  were  masked  to  treatment  assignment  for  the 
duration  of  the  study  by  use  of  a  double  dummy  approach.  Chiesi  Global  Pharmacovigilance  staff  had 
Assessment report

their  own  unblinding  codes  to  unblind  patients  in  case  of  suspected  unexpected  serious adverse reactions 
(SUSARs) to be reported to the competent Regulatory Authorities  and/or the EC/IRB. 
Statistical methods 
Primary Efficacy Variable 
The study had a single primary endpoint, i.e. the number of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations over 
52 weeks  of  treatment.  The  number  of  moderate  and  severe  COPD  exacerbations  was  analysed  using  a 
negative  binomial  model  including  treatment,  country,  number  of  COPD  exacerbations  during  the 
previous  year  (1,  >  1), severity of airflow limitation (i.e. post-bronchodilator FEV1 at screening < 30% or 
≥  30%  of  the  predicted normal value) and smoking status as fixed effects and log-time on study in years 
as  an  offset.  The  adjusted  exacerbation  rate  in  each  treatment  group  and  the  adjusted  rate  ratio  with 
associated 95% Wald confidence  intervals  (CIs) were estimated by the model. 
Superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over  IND/GB  was  demonstrated  if  the  upper  limit  of  the  95%  CI  for  the 
adjusted exacerbation rate ratio was < 1. 
Secondary Efficacy Variables 
•  Time  to  first  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbation  and  time  to first severe COPD exacerbation 
were  analysed  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazard  regression  model  including  treatment,  country, 
number  of  COPD  exacerbations  during  the  previous  year  (1,  >  1),  severity  of  airflow  limitation 
and smoking status as factors. A Kaplan-Meier  plot was also presented; 
•  Number  of  severe  COPD  exacerbations  and  number  of  moderate  COPD  exacerbations  were 
analysed  using  the same model as for the primary  efficacy variable; 
•  Changes  from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV1 and FVC as well as changes from baseline in the 
SGRQ  total  score  and  domain  scores,  at  each  visit  and  over  the  entire  treatment  period  were 
analysed  using  a  linear  MMRM  including  treatment,  country,  visit,  treatment  by  visit  interaction, 
number  of  COPD  exacerbations  during  the  previous  year  (1,  >  1),  severity  of  airflow  limitation 
and  smoking  status  as  fixed  effects,  and  baseline  and  baseline  by  visit  interaction  as  covariates. 
An unstructured  covariance matrix was assumed; 
• 
FEV1  and  SGRQ  responses  at  Week  26  and  Week  52  were  analysed  using  a  logistic  regression 
model  including  treatment,  country,  number  of  COPD  exacerbations  during  the  previous  year  (1, 
>  1),  severity  of  airflow limitation and smoking status as factors and baseline FEV1 or SGRQ as a 
covariate; 
•  Changes  from  baseline  to  each  inter-visit  period  and  over  the  entire  treatment  period  in  the 
percentage  of  days,  nights  and  complete  days  (i.e.  day  +  night)  without  intake  of  rescue 
medication  as  well  as  in  the  average  day-time, night-time and overall (i.e. day-time + night-time) 
use  of  rescue  medication  were  analysed  using  a  linear  MMRM  including  treatment,  country,  inter-
visit  period,  treatment  by  inter-visit  period  interaction,  number  of  COPD  exacerbations  during  the 
previous  year,  severity  of  airflow  limitation  and  smoking  status  as  fixed  effects,  as  well  as 
baseline  and  baseline  by  inter-visit  period  interaction  as  covariates.  An  unstructured  covariance 
matrix  was  assumed  and  weights  proportional  to  their  duration  were  assigned  to  inter-visit 
periods; 
•  Changes  from  baseline  to  each  inter-visit  period  and  over  the  entire  treatment  period  in  the 
average  EXACT-PRO  total  score  and  domain  scores  were  analysed  using  the  same  model  as  for 
the rescue medication  use ;

•  Nocturnal  symptoms  were  collected  in  the  EXACT-PRO  domain  number  13  and  were  analysed 
using  the same model as for the rescue medication  use; 
•  Change  from  baseline  in the CAT score at the end of treatment was summarised using descriptive

Figure  3: Time  to discontinuation  from study TRIPLE 8 (Kaplan-Meier  analysis,  randomised 
population) 
Overall,  the  vast  majority  of  patients  randomised  completed  at  least  visit  6/40  weeks  of  treatment 
(90.1%  in  group  CHF  5993  pMDI  and  87.5%  in  group  IND/GB,  respectively),  and  87.2  and  84.4  in  the 
CHF 5993 pMDI and IND/GB  groups respectively  completed ≥52 weeks of treatment. 
According  to  a  Kaplan-Meier  analysis,  the  probability  of  treatment  discontinuation  in  the  two  groups  was 
comparable  during  the  first  12  weeks  of  treatment  whereas  for  the  remainder  of  the  treatment  period it 
was somewhat lower in group CHF 5993 pMDI as compared with IND/GB. 
Recruitment 
A  total  of  1532  patients  were  randomised  by  17  countries  (average  screening  failure  rate  27.2%  with 
important between-site variability).  The majority of countries 
were  European  (N=14,  82%),  two  were  South-American  (Argentina,  Chile)  and  one  Central  American 
(Mexico).  The  largest  proportion  of randomised patients came from Europe (N=1343, 88%); five Eastern 
European  countries  accounted  for  about  70%  of  study  population  (Bulgaria  20%,  Romania  14%,  Poland 
13%, Latvia 12% and the Czech Republic  10%).

Baseline data 
Independently  of  the  population  assessed  (safety,  ITT,  PP),  demographics  were  comparable  between 
treatment  groups  (Table  4).  The  vast  majority  of  patients  in  the  safety  population  were  white  (92.2%) 
and  predominantly  male  (71.8%).  The median age upon screening was 65 years (range: 41 to 87 years) 
and  the  median  BMI  25.6  kg/m2  (range:  13-47). About half of the patients in both groups were between 
40 and 64 years old and 10% had an age of ≥75 years. 
Important  characteristics  of  the  underlying  COPD  were  well  balanced  between  treatment  groups.  Prior  to 
study  entry,  the  vast  majority  of  patients  (80.8%)  had  experienced  a  single  exacerbation  only  in  the 
previous  year.  More  than  85%  of  patients  in  both  groups  received  dual  therapy  consisting of a LABA and 
an ICS (about 60%) or dual bronchodilator  therapy (LABA  / LAMA, about 25%).

Numbers analysed 
All  patients  randomised  (N=1532)  were  treated  (i.e.  received  at  least  one  dose  of  IMP)  and  had at least 
one  day  of  follow-up  after  the  first  IMP  intake.  Safety  and  ITT  populations  were  identical  and  included 
100% of patients; the PP population  included  1479 / 1532 patients (96.5%). 
Major  protocol  violations were thus reported in a total of 53 patients, 22 (2.9%) in group CHF5993 pMDI 
and 31 (4.0%) in group IND/GB.  An overview is presented  in  Table 5.

Outcomes  and estimation 
Rate of Moderate-to-Severe COPD Exacerbations over 52 weeks of treatment (Primary  Endpoint) 
Over  52 weeks of treatment, less patients in group CHF 5993 pMDI experienced less moderate-to-severe 
exacerbations  (35.7%,  433  events)  as  compared  with  IND/GB  (37.5%,  485  events)  (ITT  population). 
Thus, the adjusted exacerbation rate per patient per year was lower with CHF 5993 pMDI (0.504, 95% CI 
[0.447, 0.569]) as compared with IND/GB (0.595 [0.530, 0.668]) (Table 6). 
The  resulting  adjusted  rate  ratio  was  0.848  (95%  CI  [0.723,  0.995]),  thereby  confirming  a statistically 
significant  reduction  of  15.2%  in  the  rate  of  moderate-to-severe  COPD  exacerbations  and  thus  the 
superiority  of CHF 5993 pMDI over IND/GB (p=0.043). 
Results  of  the  PP  analysis  for  the  primary variable evolved in the same direction though no more meeting 
statistical  significance  (adjusted  rate  ratio  of  0.849,  95% CI  [0.721,  1.000],  p=0.05)  (Table7.  The  pre-
defined  sensitivity  analyses  (conducted  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  different  methods  for  handling  missing 
data  or  the  impact  of  discrepancies  in  the  severity  of  airflow  limitation  as  recorded  in  IRS  and  eCRF) 
showed similar  trends and thereby confirmed the overall  conclusions.

The  treatment  effect  was  greater  in  patients  with  severe  airflow  limitation  (30%≤FEV1<50%  predicted), 
current  smokers,  females,  patients  with  chronic  bronchitis  phenotype  COPD,  patients  who  had  only  a 
single  documented  COPD  exacerbation  in  the  year prior to enrolment, and those with a relative eosinophil 
count at screening  of ≥2% (Figure  4).

The  results  of  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  and  of  all  the  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  moderate/severe 
COPD  exacerbation  rate,  including  the  additional  one  based  on  the  J2R  approach,  are  summarised  in 
Figure  5.  The  sensitivity  analyses  confirmed  the  results  of  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  with  very  similar 
estimates  of  the  exacerbation  rate  ratio  (range:  0.847  –  0.859)  despite  the  conservative  assumptions 
considered  in  some  scenarios  (CR  and  J2R).  Such  consistent  results  support  the  superior  efficacy  of 
TRIMBOW  compared Indacaterol/GB  in  the reduction  of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations.

Time to First Moderate-to-Severe Exacerbation (Secondary Endpoint) 
Time  to  the  first  moderate-to-severe  exacerbation  was  prolonged  with  CHF  5993  pMDI,  resulting  in  a 
numerically  lower  probability  of  exacerbation  in  the  Cox  proportional  hazards  analysis  (hazard  ratio  of 
0.901, 95% CI [0.763; 1.064], p=0.219). 
Change from Baseline  in Trough  FEV1 at Week 52 (Secondary Endpoint) 
In  both  treatment  groups,  there  was  a  small  decline  in  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  over  the  52-week 
treatment  period.  The  adjusted  mean  difference  in  trough  FEV1  between  treatments  was  consistently  in 
favour  of  CHF  5993 pMDI (Figure 6 and Table10). At week 52, the pre-dose morning FEV1 had a slightly, 
but  statistically  significantly  decrease  in  both  groups  with  no  significant  between  group  difference 
(adjusted mean changes of -0.029, 95%CI [-0.046; -0.012] in group CHF 5993 pMDI and -0.049, 95%CI 
[-0.066; -0.031] in group IND/GB; adjusted  mean difference  0.019, 95%CI [-0.005; 0.043]. 
The  adjusted  mean  change  in  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  from  baseline  averaged  over  the  entire  treatment 
period  did  not  differ  from  baseline  with  CHF  5993  pMDI  (-0.003L,  95%CI  [-0.016;  0.010],  p=0.602), 
while  it  slightly  decreased  under  treatment  with  IND/GB  (-0.026 L,  95%CI  [-0.039;  -0.013],  p<0.001). 
The  adjusted  mean  difference  between  groups  was  small,  but  statistically  significant  (0.022,  95%CI 
[0.004; 0.040], p=0.018). 
In  the  FEV1  responder  analysis,  the  percentage  of  patients  in  whom  the  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  had 
increased  by  ≥100 mL at week 52 was numerically greater in group  CHF 5993 pMDI (19%) as compared 
with IND/GB  (16.3%), resulting  in an odds ratio of 1.190 (95%CI [0.913; 1.550], p=0198).

Change from Baseline  in SGRQ Total Score at Week 52 (Secondary Endpoint) 
In  both  treatment groups, there was a decrease in the SGRQ total score from baseline averaged over the 
52-week  treatment  period,  indicating  an  improvement  with  triple  and  dual  treatment  (adjusted  mean 
changes  of  -3.20  and  -1.52  units,  respectively;  p<0.001  in  both  cases)  (Figure  7).  CHF  5993  pMDI 
resulted  in  a  greater  improvement  in  this  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL)  tool  as  evidenced  by  the 
adjusted  mean  difference  between  treatments  of  -1.68  units  (95%CI  [-2.55;  -0.81],  p<0.001).  The 
greatest improvements were observed in  the SGRQ symptoms and impact scores.

Supportive study TRIPLE  7 
The  design  of  the  study  substantially  differs  from  that  of  other  phase III-IIIb  studies,  namely  by  the 
open-label  treatment  and  the  shorter  total  treatment  duration  of  26  weeks  only  (thereby  not preventing 
seasonal influences  on the exacerbation rate). 
As  mentioned  earlier,  the  main  objective  of  the  open-label,  active-controlled  study  TRIPLE  7  was  to 
demonstrate  that  Trimbow®  is  non-inferior  to  commercially  available,  extemporary  triple  therapy  (fixed 
combination  of  fluticasone  and  vilanterol  plus  tiotropium)  in  terms  of  a  single  primary  endpoint,  the 
St. George’s  Respiratory  Questionnaire  (SGRQ)  total  score  as  a  measure  of  health-related  quality  of  life 
(HRQoL). 
For  that  purpose,  the  change  from  baseline  in  SGRQ  at  week  26of  treatment  was  compared.  Based  on 
scientific  literature  and  available  clinical  evidence,  the  putative  MCID  of  4 units  for  the  total  SGRQ  score 
was  chosen  as  the  non-inferiority  margin  (i.e.  upper  limit  of  the  two-sided  95% CI  <4 units,  one-sided 
significance  level  of  0.025).  Since  non-inferiority  was  to  be  demonstrated,  the  MAH  postulated  that  PP 
and ITT  populations  had equal  importance for the statistical  analysis  of the primary  efficacy variable. 
Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of CHF5993 pMDI on lung function parameters, patient’s 
health  status  and  on  clinical  outcome  measures,  to  assess  the  impact  of  study  treatments  on  health 
economic  outcomes,  and  to  evaluate  the  overall  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  administered  study 
treatments. 
After  a  2-week  open-label  run-in  period  of  tiotropium  (18 μg/day),  patients  were  randomised  in  a  1:1 
ratio to receive one of the following  open-label  treatments for 26 weeks: 
•  CHF5993  pMDI 100/6/12.5 μg (delivered dose: 87/5/9 μg BDP/FF/GB), 2 puffs twice daily (total daily 
nominal  dose: 400/24/50 μg BDP/FF/GB); 
• 
fluticasone/vilanterol  100/25 μg  DPI  (delivered  dose:  92/22 μg 
fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol 
trifenatate),  1 inhalation  once  daily  plus  tiotropium  18  μg  inhalation  powder  (delivered  dose  by  hard 
capsule:  10 μg tiotropium bromide),  1 capsule once daily. 
Subsequent  visits  were performed after 4 weeks (V3), 12 weeks (V4) and  26 weeks (V5) of treatment 
and a follow-up call  1 week after V5.

Patient  characteristics 
Starting on 29MAY2015 (FPFV), a total of 1477 patients were screened, of whom 1157 were randomised 
to  either  CHF5993  pMDI  (N=578)  or  fluticasone/vilanterol  plus  tiotropium  (N=579).  The  majority  of 
patients  (94.6%)  completed  the  study  (LPLV  on  05  January  2017).  Overall,  the  probability  of  premature 
discontinuation  from the study was comparable in  the two treatment groups. 
Demographic  characteristics  were  comparable  between  treatment  groups.  Patients  enrolled  were 
predominantly  white  and  male  (N=874,  75.5%),  the  mean  age was 63.9 years (53.5% aged <65 years, 
37.2% aged between 65 and 74 years and 9.3% aged ≥75 years).  
On  average,  patients  were  diagnosed  with  COPD  about  8 years  prior  to  enrolment  with  no  relevant 
between-group  differences 
(8.1 years 
in  group  CHF5993  pMDI  and  7.7 years 
in  group 
fluticasone/vilanterol  +  tiotropium).  Patients  were  either  current  or  ex-smokers,  with  an  overall  mean  of 
37.7 pack-years  and  a  mean  smoking  duration  of  38.6 years.  Only  a  small  percentage  of  patients 
changed  their  smoking status during  the study. 
At  study  entry,  disease  severity  was  comparable  and  the  majority  of patients were on double treatment, 
combining either a LABA with an ICS (73.5% vs. 72.5% of patients) or two bronchodilators (LABA / LAMA 
18.7% vs. 19.3%). LAMA monotherapy was taken by 7.4% of patients  in each group. 
The  mean  number  of  COPD  exacerbations  in  the  previous  year  was  comparable  in  the  two  treatment 
groups,  with  a  vast  majority  of  patients  having  one  such  episode  recorded  in  their  medical  files.  About 
20%  of patients had very severe airflow limitation as demonstrated by an FEV1 of  <30% of the predicted 
normal value. 
Results 
A  total  of  1157 patients  were  randomized  at  103 recruiting  sites  in  12 countries  (Belgium,  Germany, 
Hungary,  Lithuania,  Netherlands,  Poland, Romania,  Russia,  South Africa,  Sweden, Turkey,  and UK): 
•  CHF 5993 pMDI: 
• 
fluticasone/vilanterol  + tiotropium 
N=578 patients 
N=579 patients 
The  majority  of  patients  in  both  groups  completed  the  study  as  planned  by  the  clinical  trial  protocol 
(94.3% vs. 94.8%). 
At  baseline,  the  mean  SGRQ  total  score  was  comparable  in  both  groups  (SGRQ  total scores of 52.7 and 
53.0  in  groups CHF  5993  pMDI  and  fluticasone /  vilanterol  plus  tiotropium,  respectively).  With  both 
treatments  and  independent  of  the  analysis  population,  there  was  a  (clinically)  significant  adjusted  mean 
decrease  from  baseline  in  SGRQ  total  score  (-6.82 units  vs.  -7.82units), indicating that the health-related 
patient  status had improved over the 26-week treatment period in  both groups (Table  14and Table  15. 
The  adjusted  mean  difference  between  groups  was  in  favour  of  group  fluticasone/vilanterol  plus 
tiotropium  (i.e.  slightly  more  important  improvement  under  the  extemporaneous  triple  therapy),  but 
since  the  upper  95%  confidence  interval  of  the  adjusted  mean  difference  was  <4 units  (i.e.  2.64 units  in 
the  PP  analysis  and  2.65 units  in  the  ITT  analysis),  from  a  formal  point  of view the non-inferiority of CHF 
5993 pMDI over extemporary triple  therapy (fluticasone  / vilanterol  plus  tiotropium) was demonstrated. 
Results  of sensitivity  and post hoc stratified  analyses confirmed  the overall  conclusions of the trial 
(Figure8. 
At  week 26,  about  50%  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  were  responders,  i.e.  had  a  change  from 
baseline  in  the  total  SGRQ  score  of  ≤-4 units  (51.3%  vs.  53.1%;  odds  ratio  0.929,  95%CI  [0.728;

domain scores (symptoms, impact, and activity  scores).

Figure  8: Forest plot  for the adjusted  mean differences  between treatments in  the SGRQ total 
score  at week 26 
At  baseline,  the  mean  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  was  comparable  between  treatments  (1.093 L  in  group 
CHF5993  pMDI  and  1.111 L  in  group  fluticasone/vilanterol  +  tiotropium).  A  statistically  significant  mean 
increase  from  baseline  in  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  was  observed  in  both  groups  (0.060 L  vs.  0.108 L,  PP 
population),  the  between-group  difference  reaching  statistical  significance  and  favoring  the  reference 
groupat week 26 (adjusted mean difference  -0.048 L, 95%CI [-0.077; -0.019], p=0.001 PP population). 
When  calculating  FEV1  responder  rates,  CHF5993  pMDI  was  statistically  significantly  inferior  to  the 
reference  treatment  when  higher  cut-off  values  were  used,  i.e.  the  percentage  of  patients  with  relevant 
improvements in  FEV1 of ≥100 mL or ≥120 ml (not shown).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  currently  approved  indication  wording  “…[COPD  patients]  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a 
combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a  long-acting  β2-agonist”  highlights  the  lack  of  evidence  to 
claim  a  step-up  indication  from  the  combination  of  a  long-acting  muscarinic  receptor  antagonist  (LAMA) 
and  a  long-acting  beta2  agonist  (LABA)  due  to  the  absence  of  the  combination  of  LAMA  and  LABA  as 
comparator  in  the  pivotal  Phase  III  study  at  time  of  the  MAA  of  TRIMBOW,  a  triple  combination  of  an 
inhaled  corticosteroid (ICS), and LABA  and LAMA.  
The  MAH  is  now  applying  for  a  broader  indication  including  newly  a  step-up  indication  from  the 
combination  of  a  LAMA  and  LABA  (e.g.  Indacaterol/GB).  Two  completed  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  trials 
(one  pivotal  study  TRIPLE  8  and  one  supportive  study  TRIPLE  7)  in  support  of  the  extension  of  variation 
are presented.  
In  studies  TRIPLE  7  and  TRIPLE  8,  a  total  of  1157/1532  patients  were  randomised  at  103/187  sites  in 
12/17 countries, respectively. 
Reportedly,  a  single  two-day  systems  audit  covering  both  studies  (TRIPLE  7 and TRIPLE 8) and three site 
audits  covering  TRIPLE  8  (each  lasting  for  one  to  two  days  only),  were performed by or on behalf of the 
MAH.  Moreover,  inspections  were  performed  at  unidentified  sites  by local authorities in Austria and Latvia. 
The  MAH  claims  that  the  annual  audit  plan  /  programme  follows  a  risk-based  approach;  SOP  DRQA-SP-
11-008  -  Audits  of  Clinical  Trials  however  permits  to  select  clinical  sites  for  an  audit  activity  because  a 
routine  health  authority  inspection  has  been  announced.  This  means  that  for  the  pivotal  study  TRIPLE  8, 
two out of three site visits / audits were performed in a reactive manner but not using a prospective, risk-
based approach. 
No  critical  observations  or  relevant  GCP  issues  were  identified  during  the  sponsor  audits  or  health 
authority  inspections  of the pivotal  study TRIPLE  8. 
For  study  TRIPLE  7,  critical  observations  were  reported  from  both  internal  audits  and  health  authority 
inspections.  In  the  quality  systems  audit  of  the  CRO’s  data  management  unit  (ICON  Clinical  Research, 
South  County  Business  Park,  Dublin,  Ireland)  performed  from  04  to  05NOV2015,  a  critical  finding  was 
identified,  i.e.  unsatisfactory  oversight  by  project  management.  The  impact  or  consequences  of  this non-
conformity are not revealed.  Reportedly,  satisfactory CAPA measures were implemented. 
This  contrasts  with  the  observation  that  in  study  TRIPLE  8  erroneous  treatment  compliance  figures  were 
distributed  prior  to  each  of  the  three  blinded  data  review  meeting,  making  it  necessary  to    modify  the 
assignment  of six subjects to the PP population  after unblinding.

Overall,  the  MAH  has  undertaken  limited  efforts  to  assess  and  assure  the  reliability  and  integrity  of  the 
trial  systems  against  own  written  standards  and  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  Annual  audit  plans  / 
programmes  were  finalised  with  significant  delay  and  for  the  pivotal  study  TRIPLE  8,  only  a  single  site 
audit  was  performed  that  followed  a  proactive  and  risk-based  approach.  This  finding  may  challenge  the 
internal  validity  of the study / data reliability. 
TRIPLE  8 
Design and conduct of clinical study 
According to the most recent GOLD recommendation (update 2017), a dual bronchodilator therapy with a 
LABA  plus  LAMA  is  the  first  choice  when  treating  patients  with  COPD  who are symptomatic and at risk of 
exacerbations.  The  choice  of  the  active  comparator  in  TRIPLE  8  and  more  specifically  the  recently 
approved combination therapy (IND/GB,  tradename Ultibro®  Breezehaler®) is acceptable.  
Eligibility  criteria  in  study  TRIPLE  8  were  comparable  to  those  defined  for  the  pivotal  studies  included  in 
the  application  to  obtain  the  initial  MA  of  TRIMBOW.  Though  the  severity  of  airflow  limitation  is  no  longer 
used  as  a  criterion  for  the  COPD  severity  classification  by  the  GOLD  update  2017,  patients  enrolled  in 
TRIPLE  8  belonged  to  GOLD  groups  B  and  D  as  based  on  their  symptom  severity  and  exacerbation  risk. 
Study  patients  were  thus  at  the  more  severe  end  of  the  COPD  spectrum  and  symptomatic  despite  dual 
therapy. 
Of  note,  there  was  no  step  down  in  treatment  upon  enrolment.  Solely  patients  already  receiving  dual 
treatment or LAMA monotherapy were included. 
As  was  the  case  for  prior  studies,  the  MAH  excluded  patients  with  clinically  significant  cardiovascular 
conditions  from  study  participation,  e.g.  those  with  unstable  ischaemic  heart  disease,  NYHA  Class  III/IV 
left  ventricular  failure,  acute  ischaemic  heart  disease  in  the  year  prior  to  the  screening  examination  or  a 
history  of  sustained  cardiac  arrhythmias.  In  combination  with  the  limited  number  of patients enrolled, this 
limits  the assessment of the cardiovascular  safety of the compound. 
Study  TRIPLE  8  had  a  single  primary  outcome,  i.e.  the  rate  of  moderate-to-severe  COPD  exacerbations 
over  52  weeks  of  treatment.  The  definition  of  what  represents  a  COPD  exacerbation  was in line with the 
one  proposed  by  the  respective  EMA/CHMP  guideline  issued  in  2012.  A  number  of  clarifications  and 
refinements  were included  in  the clinical  trial  protocol which appears acceptable.   
Overall,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  primary  endpoint  chosen  was  a  clinically  relevant  one.  However,  the 
EMA  guidance  document’s  recommendation  to  have  all  exacerbation  episodes  evaluated  by  a  blinded 
external  adjudication  committee  was  not  followed.  Instead,  an  arbitrary  numerical  criterion  (i.e.  a 10 day 
time  gap)  was  defined  in  the  SAP  in  order  to  decide  whether  an  episode  was  a  new  event  rather  than 
being  a  relapse  or  continuation  of  a  previously  recorded  one.  The  applicant  confirmed  that  the  arbitrary 
10-day  time  gap  for  the  primary  exacerbation  endpoint  was  chosen  early  in  line  with  previous  studies 
(e.g. TRIPLE  5 and TRIPLE  6) and already  specified  in  the first  draft version of the SAP. 
No  attempts  were  made  by  the  MAH  to  follow  all  patients for the full duration of the study and to record 
subsequent  exacerbation  events,  should  they  have  stopped  IMP  intake. Instead, the log-time in the study 
was  included  as  offset  in  the  negative  binomial  model  used  for  the  analysis  of  the  primary  response 
variable.  This  seems  to  be  acceptable  as  88.7%  of  patients  in  the  CHF  5993  pMDI  group  and  85.4%  in 
the  IND/GB  group  completed more than 48 weeks of treatment, and 87.2% and 84.4% in the CHF 5993 
pMDI  and IND/GB  groups respectively  at  ≥52 weeks of treatment. 
The MAH was requested to make available  a copy of report resulting  from the blinded  data review 
meeting  from the requested documentation it becomes apparent that the the secondary population  for 
analysis  (i.e.  the per-protocol population)  was modified  after unblinding”. 
Assessment report

.  The  reason  given  by  the  applicant  is  an  error  in  the  reported treatment compliance values for a total of 
six  patients. Five of them were classified post hoc to be major protocol violators (and thus excluded from 
the  PP  analysis),  and  another  one  confirmed  to  have  adequate  compliance  (and  thus  included  in  the  PP 
analysis).  Reportedly,  this was done by applying  the same pre-defined  criteria  as for other patients.   
The  post  hoc  modifications  applied  to  the  PP  population  appear  to  have  had  no  impact  on  the  primary 
results  of  the  study,  but  quality  problem.  The  criticality  of  this  observation  also  appears  to  result  more 
from  the  fact  that  this  important  incident  (i.e.  unblinded  modification  of  the  per-protocol  population)  was 
omitted  and  not  made  transparent  in  the  final  CSR.  Instead,  the  false  impression  was  given  that  all 
decisions  were  taken  and the populations to be used in the analysis entirely defined prior to database lock 
and  prior  to  unblinding.  This  is  considered  not  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  In  its  response,  the  applicant 
however  agreed  that  this  incident  should  have  been  made transparent in the clinical study report of study 
TRIPLE  8 and the overall submission. 
Patients  in  both  groups  were  comparable  in  terms  of  demography  and  baseline  characteristics,  in 
particular  COPD  history.  In  accordance  with  inclusion  criterion  #6,  patients  received  either  mono-  or 
double  therapy,  but  no  triple  therapy  prior  to  study  entry.  Thus,  in  this  study  there  was  no step-down in 
therapy upon randomisation  which might  have penalised  the comparator group. 
The  study  population  is  predominantly  (Eastern)  European  and  may  be  a  representative  sample  though 
the  course  of  COPD  and  rate  of  exacerbations  may  be  influenced  by  country-level  socioeconomic  and 
environmental  factors.  
Primary  analysis  and  sensitivity  analyses  
Over  52  weeks  of  treatment,  less  patients  in  group  TRIMBOW  experienced  less  moderate-to-severe 
exacerbations  (35.7%,  433  events)  as  compared  with  IND/GB  (37.5%,  485  events)  (ITT  population). 
Thus,  the  adjusted  exacerbation  rate  per  patient  per  year  was  lower  with  TRIMBOW  (0.504,  95%  CI 
[0.447,  0.569])  as  compared  with  IND/GB  (0.595 [0.530, 0.668]). The resulting adjusted rate ratio was 
0.848  (95%  CI  [0.723,  0.995]),  thereby  formally  confirming  a  statistically  significant  reduction of 15.2% 
in the rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations and thus the superiority of TRIMBOW over IND/GB 
(p=0.043).  Also,  results  of  the  additional  sensitivity  analyses  (see  below  “Definition  of  a  single 
exacerbation”)  support  the  consistently  borderline  results  for  the  primary  endpoint.  Depending  on  the 
analysis,  results  are  non-significant  or  borderline  significant.  Furthermore,  since  a  treatment  policy 
estimand  is  of  higher  relevance  than  a  hypothetical  one,  an  analysis  based  on  reference  data 
(CR  or  J2R)  would  have  been  the  preferred  option  from  a  regulatory  point  of  view.  Both 
reference-based  imputation  approaches  failed  to  reach  statistical  significance  (see  below  “Missing  data”). 
Overall,  although  treatment  effect  estimates  favour  TRIMBOW,  the  study  results  are  not  associated  with 
the  statistically  compelling  evidence.  These  issues  are  further  discussed  in  the  overall  conclusions  of  the 
clinical  efficacy section. 
Clinical  relevance 
There  is  currently  no  consensus  as  to  what  constitutes  the  minimal  clinical  important  difference  (MCID) 
for  COPD  exacerbations  as  the  impact  of  their  reduction/prevention  appears  to  be  influenced  by  various 
factors,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  choice  of  the  comparator,  baseline  status/characteristics  of  the 
patient  population  assessed  as  well  as  by  the  definitions  used  for  grading  exacerbation  severity  and 
frequency.  Recently,  Chapman  and  coll.  (2013)  suggested  that  interventions  reducing  exacerbations  by 
as  little  as  11%  may  be  considered  as  clinically  relevant.  In  TRIPLE  8  study,  the  rate  of  moderate-to-
severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks was lower with BDP/FF/GB than with IND/GB, with a rate ratio 
of  0.848  (95%  CI  [0.723,  0.995],  p-value=0.043)  indicating  a  15%  reduction  in  the  exacerbation  rate. 
However,  it  should  be  stressed  that  this  difference,  in  absolute  terms  (an  estimated  reduction  in  0.09 
exacerbations  per  patient  per  year,  from  0.594  with  LABA/LAMA  to  0.504  with  the  triple  therapy),  is 
considered  modest  from  a  clinical  perspective.  It  is  conceded  that  the  chosen  study  design  and 
Assessment report

population  –  in  contrast  to  other  recently  published  studies  -  did  not  penalise  the  comparator  group  nor 
did  it inflate  artificially  the rate of moderate and severe COPD exacerbations.   
When  reviewing  the  data,  an  instance  was  seen  where  a  fatal  SAE  in  a  patient  of  group  CHF  5993 pMDI 
may  not  have  been  correctly  classified  and  reported  as  COPD  exacerbation.  The  case  involves a 58-year 
old white male patient randomised to receive CHF5993 pMDI. The last study visit preceding the event was 
Visit  5,  at  week 26.  Reportedly,  the  patient  experienced  an  event  of  acute  respiratory  failure  (coded  PT: 
acute  respiratory  failure)  and  was  successfully  reanimated  while  transported  to  a  hospital.  More  detailed 
clinical  and  laboratory  diagnostic  criteria  (e.g.  arterial  blood  gas  test  results)  are  not  reported.  The  event 
was  considered  to  be  serious,  severe  in  intensity,  but  not  related  to  the  study  medication.  The  patient 
remained  in  a  serious  condition  and  died  two  days  later  from  a  second  episode  of  cardiac  arrest.  Only  a 
single  COPD  exacerbation  of  moderate  intensity  is  reported  for  this  patient.  The  acute  respiratory  failure 
did  not result  in  recording  an acute exacerbation of the underlying  COPD.  
The MAH was requested to comment on the case and to set out the reasons why it was excluded that the 
acute  respiratory  failure  reported  in  patient  was  the  result  of  an  acute  exacerbation  of  COPD.  The  MAH 
claims  that  the  reason  for  the  ICU  admission  and  cardiopulmonary  admission  was a myocardial infarction 
and  that  the  inappropriate  SAE  term  reported  by  the  investigator  (preferred  term,  PT: «acute respiratory 
failure»)  was  not  further  challenged  by  the  MAH.  No  relevant  pre-existing  cardiovascular  conditions 
besides  mild  hypertension  were  reported  for  this  patient.  The  patient  in  question  had  already experienced 
a COPD exacerbation  of moderate intensity.   
Notable,  in  study  TRIPLE  7,  another  patient  had  suddenly  and  unexpectedly  died  a  few  days  only  after 
having  had  an  uneventful  study  visit  3.  The  case  was  reported  by  the  investigator  as  «respiratory 
failure»,  but  in  this  case  autopsy  results  clearly  pointed  towards  an  acute  and  purulent  infection  of  the 
lung  as  the  direct  cause  of  death.  In  spite  of  this  evidence,  the  event  was  not  counted  by  Chiesi  as  an 
acute  exacerbation  of  COPD.  As  was  also  the  case  for  one patient, the applicant did not challenge the AE 
term  reported  by  the  investigator  in  order  to  have  a  more  accurate  event  term  in  the  study 
documentation, i.e.  the triggering  event or preferably  a diagnosis. 
Thus  and  in  conclusion,  based  on  these  two  examples,  doubts  remain  on  whether  due  care and diligence 
were  exercised  by  the  applicant  (or  its  service  providers) throughout trial conduct in fully assessing fatal / 
serious events and potential  COPD exacerbations. 
Definition  of a single  exacerbation 
In  order  to  support the primary evaluation and the chosen time gap to define single exacerbations several 
additional  analysis  were requested and  provided by the applicant. 
Re-analysis  of  exacerbation  data  applying  different  time  gaps  to  define  single  exacerbations  overall 
support  the  borderline  study  results.  Irrespective  of  the  time  gap  applied, point estimates are very similar 
(slightly  smaller  for  time  gaps  <10  days  and  slightly  larger  for  time  gaps  >10)  and  borderline 
significant/non-significant  depending  on  the  time-gap  applied  (for  15  and  20  day  time  gaps  results  are 
not significant). 
In  absence  of  a  blinded  external  adjudication  committee  to  define  single  exacerbations  and  given  the 
arbitrary rule to define two exacerbations periods as a single one if they are not more than 10 days apart, 
analyses  not  depending  on  the  specific  number  of  exacerbations  per  patients  were  requested;  in 
particular,  analysis  of  the  binary  endpoint  “any  exacerbation”  and  analysis  of  the  number  of exacerbation 
days  per  patient  were  provided.  The  proportion  of  patient  with  any  exacerbations  was  rather  similar 
between  both  groups  and  only  slightly  lower  for  TRIMBOW  (35.7%  vs,  37.5%;  odds-ratio  0.918).  This 
analysis  is  not  significant  due  to  the  low  treatment  difference  and  the low sample size (power) for binary 
evaluation.  Counting  the number of exacerbation days per patient revealed on average a lower number of 
days  for  TRIMBOW  (7.32  vs.  9.62).  Based  on  an  ANOVA  model  this  difference  of  -2.3  was  significant. 
Similar  results  were  observed  applying  a  negative  binomial  model  to  analyse  exacerbation  days.  A  rank 
ANOVA  failed  to  show  statistical  significance  by  far;  probably  due  to  the large number of patients without

exacerbations  (i.e.  zero  exacerbation days). These tied values (~63%) reduce the power of a rank based 
analysis.  Given  the  low  number  of  exacerbations  per  patient  (around  95%  of  patients  had  0,  1  or  2 
exacerbations)  evaluation  of  the  number  of  exacerbations  as  categorical  variable  seems  a  reasonable 
approach.  While  this  analysis  suggested  a  trend  in  favour  of  TRIMBOW  it  by  far  failed  to  reach  statistical 
significance. 
In  summary,  none  of  these  analyses  were  pre-specified  and  they  overall  show  and  support  the 
consistently  borderline  results  for  the  evaluation  of  exacerbations.  Treatment  effect  estimates are mostly 
similar  and  are  depending  on  the  analysis  (borderline)  significant  or  not-significant.  Additional  analyses 
overall  support the consistency of borderline  significant  study results.   
The  primary  analysis  that  was  used  targets  a  hypothetical  estimand  of  the treatment effect if all subjects 
adhered  to  treatment.  Although  it  remains  unclear,  the  primary  analysis  is  apparently  based  on  on-
treatment data only and no observation was recorded after treatment discontinuation. Hence, a treatment 
policy  estimand on the treatment effect irrespective  of treatment discontinuation  is difficult  to estimate.  
The  Applicant  clarified  that  patients  were  not  planned  to  be  followed  up  after  treatment  discontinuation. 
Still,  some  patients  were  observed  after  they  stopped  treatment.  For  most  patients  the  follow-up  after 
treatment  discontinuation  (TD)  was  short.  Total  planned  follow-up  time  over  all  patients  was  763.  5  and 
767.5  years  for  Trimbow  and  comparator  respectively.  Total  on-treatment  time  (time  prior  to  TD)  was 
716.3 and 707.4 years and total off-treatment time (time between TD and study discontinuation) was 1.7 
and 2.6 years. Furthermore, only 3 exacerbations occurred during  off-treatment follow-up. 
Hence,  Follow-up  of  patients  is  overall  rather  complete.  The  analysis  was  based  on  the  total  follow-up 
time  (including  off-treatment  follow-up).  This  is  in  principle  supported,  but  given  that  off-treatment 
follow-up  is  extremely  limited  the  primary  analysis  rather  addresses  a  hypothetical  effect  had  all  patients 
adhered  to  study  treatment.  The  effect  regardless  of  treatment  discontinuations  (treatment  policy 
estimand)  is  considered  of  higher  relevance  as  compared  to  the  hypothetical  estimand.  However,  in  lack 
of  sufficient  off-treatment  follow-up  the  treatment  policy  estimand  is  difficult  to  estimate.  The  most 
appropriate  option  in  this  situation  would  be  to  use  multiple  imputation  based  on reference data to cover 
the  missing  follow-up  time  (copy  reference  (CR)  and  jump  to  reference  (J2R)).  In addition to an analysis 
based  on  on-treatment  data  only,  these  analyses  were  provided  by  the  applicant  ()  and  as  expected 
(since  only  few  patients  were  not  completely  followed-up)  results  are  similar  for  all  analyses.  Point 
estimates  only  range  from  0.846  to  0.859  and  confidence  intervals  are  also  similar.  J2R  as  expected 
yields  slightly  smaller  point  estimates  as  compared  to  CR,  and  results  for  the  primary  analysis  and  the 
MAR  based  imputation  approach  are  almost  identical  (due  to  being  based  on  the  same  assumption  and 
addressing  the same hypothetical  estimand).   
In  summary,  results  of  the  additional  analyses  support  the  consistently  borderline  results  for  the  primary 
exacerbation  endpoint.  Depending  on  the  analysis,  results  are  non-significant  or  borderline 
significant.  Furthermore,  since  a  treatment  policy  estimand  is  of  higher  relevance  than  a  hypothetical 
one,  an  analysis  based  on  reference  data  (CR  or  J2R)  would  have  been  the  preferred  option  from  a 
regulatory  point  of  view.  Both  reference-based  imputation  approaches  failed  to  reach  statistical 
significance.   
The  MAH  investigated  the  heterogeneity  of  treatment  effects  across  different  subgroups  including  gender 
by  including  a  treatment  by  subgroup  interaction  term  into  the  analysis  as  requested  by  the  CHMP  
interactions  were  significant  (p-values  ≥  0.25).  Furthermore,  forest  plots  do  not  indicate  relevant 
inconsistencies  between subgroups.   
In  addition  country  effects  were  further  evaluated.  The  p-value  for  the  treatment  by  country  interaction 
was  0.871.  For  the  primary  and  main  secondary  endpoint  (time  to  first  moderate/severe  exacerbation, 
change  from  baseline  in  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  and  SGRQ  total  score over the entire treatment period), 
none  of  the  countries  dominated  the  results;  neither  with  regard  to  sample  size  nor  treatment  effect.

Confidence  intervals  are  largely  overlapping  and  point  estimates  per  country  favour  TRIMBOW  in  most 
cases. 
Although  the  optimum  cut-off  for  blood  eosinophils  still  is  a  matter  of  debate,  not  surprisingly,  stratified 
analyses  suggest  that  the  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect  with  the  triple  combination  is  greater  in 
patients  with higher  blood eosinophil  levels  of ≥2%.  
The  same  trend  in  favour  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  was  seen  when  analysing  moderate  and  severe 
exacerbations  separately.  But  as  the  study  was  not  adequately  powered  to  demonstrate  a  significant 
between-group  difference,  only  a  numerically  lower  adjusted  exacerbation  rate  per  patient  per  year  was 
reported for the CHF 5993 pMDI group.   
Treatment  with  CHF  5993  pMDI  was  favoured  by  patient-reported  outcomes,  i.e.  the  St  George's 
Respiratory  Questionnaire  (SGRQ)  total  score.  Improvement  in  mean  SGRQ  total  score  was  significantly 
better  with  CHF  5993  pMDI  than  with  IND/GLY.  In  the  responder  analyses,  a  numerically  higher 
proportion  of  patients  responded  to  CHF  5993  pMDI  than  to  IND/GLY  in  terms  of  FEV1  and  SGRQ  total 
score  change  from  baseline  at  both  Week  52,  although  the  odds  ratios  were  not  statistically  significant. 
Though  the  MCID  for  the  SGRQ  total  score  is  reported  to  be  ≥4  units,  an  adjusted  mean  change  from 
baseline over the 52 week treatment period of 3.2 and an adjusted mean between group difference of 1.7 
may be considered  to be indicative  of patient benefit.   
Supportive study TRIPLE  7 
The open-label  design  and the shorter treatment duration  of 26 weeks limit efficacy  evaluations.   
The  total  SGRQ  score  used  as  a  primary  efficacy  variable  in  this  study  is  a  generally  accepted  tool / 
questionnaire  in  order to measure the health  status in  COPD patients.   
The  non-inferiority  margin  of  4  units  was  not  sufficiently  justified  and  considered  only  clinical  judgement, 
but  not  statistical  reasoning  as  laid  down  as  a  requirement  in  the  respective  EMA  guidance  document 
(EMEA/CPMP/EWP/2158/99  dated  27  July 2005).  In addition to providing assurance that CHF 5993 pMDI 
is  not  substantially  inferior  to  the  reference  product,  the  chosen  non-inferiority  limit  should  be  calculated 
or  defined  such  that  superiority  over  placebo  is  not  left  in  doubt  in  such a two-arm trial (with no placebo 
reference).  By  pre-defining  the  MCID  of  4 units  (i.e.  the  smallest  difference  in  the  SGRQ  score  which 
patients  perceive  as  beneficial)  as  the  non-inferiority  margin,  it  is  no  more  guaranteed  that  this  latter 
requirement  is  met.  Thus,  a  more  conservative  approach  for  defining  the  non-inferiority  margin  should 
have  been  chosen  by  the  MAH.  This  reflects  the  limitations  of the data of the Triple 7 study in addition to 
the short direction  of the study.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions  on the clinical efficacy 
The  main  efficacy  assessment  is  based  on  data  generated  from  a  single  pivotal  phase  3b  trial  with study 
TRIPLE  8.  Over  52  weeks  of  treatment,  less  patients  in  group  TRIMBOW  experienced  less  moderate-to-
severe  exacerbations  (35.7%,  433  events)  as  compared  with  IND/GB  (37.5%,  485  events)  (ITT 
population).  The  resulting  adjusted  rate  ratio  was  0.848  (p=0.043,  95%  CI  [0.723,  0.995]),  thereby 
formally  confirming  a  statistical  significance.  Results  of  the  PP  population  confirmed  the  estimated  effect 
size,  but  barely  missed  statistical  significance  (p=0.050,  upper  limit  of  95%  CI=1.000).  Also,  results  of 
the  additional  analyses  support  the  consistently  borderline  results  for  the  primary  endpoint. Depending on 
the  analysis,  results  are  either  non-significant  or  borderline  significant.  Furthermore,  since  a  treatment 
policy  estimand  is  of  higher  relevance  than  a  hypothetical  one,  an  analysis  based  on  reference  data  (CR 
or  J2R)  would  have  been  the  preferred  option  from  a  regulatory  point  of  view.  Both  reference-based 
imputation  approaches failed  to reach statistical  significance. 
The rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks was lower with BDP/FF/GB than with 
Assessment report  
EMA/910019/2019 
Page 40/62 
 
  
  
IND/GB, with a rate ratio of 0.848 (95% CI [0.723, 0.995], p-value=0.043) indicating a 15% reduction in 
the  exacerbation  rate.  However,  it  should  be  stressed  that  this  difference,  in  absolute  terms  (an 
estimated  reduction  in  0.09  exacerbations  per  patient  per  year,  from  0.594  with  LABA/LAMA  to  0.504 
with the triple  therapy), is considered  modest from a clinical  perspective. 
In  addition,  several  other  issues  emerged  during  the  assessment  of  the  submitted  documentation  which 
in  this  context  challenged  the  internal  validity  of  the  study  and  data  reliability.  These  include  but  are  not 
limited  to the following: 
• 
Erroneous  subject-level  data  were  included  in  the  locked  study  database  of  the  pivotal  study 
TRIPLE  8, making  it necessary to modify the composition of the per-protocol population  after unblinding. 
• 
Though  apparently  being  of  minor  impact  and  not  affecting  the  primary  response  variable,  there 
was  a  lack  of  transparency  by  omitting  information  on  this  relevant  incident  in  the  CSR  and claiming that 
both populations  to be used in  the analysis  were defined  prior  to database lock and unblinding. 
• 
Reportedly,  annual  audit  plans  /  programmes  were  finalised  with  significant  delay  and  for  the 
pivotal  study  TRIPLE  8,  only  a  single  site  audit  was  performed  that  followed  a  proactive  and  risk-based 
approach.  Two  others  were  performed  in  a  reactive  manner  subsequent  to  the  announcement  of  a 
(routine) health  authority inspection. 
Triple  therapy  is  currently  thought  to  be  best  used  as  an  escalation  therapy  for  those  incompletely 
controlled  with  dual  therapy,  either  ICS/LABA  or  LABA/LAMA  (GOLD  2018).  While  the  applicant  has 
indeed  demonstrated  the  superiority  (although  marginal  statistically  significant)  of  the  triple  combination 
over  the  dual  components,  the  data  does  not  support  the  broadening  of  the  indication  for use as a first-
line  therapy  (i.e.  “Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  chronic  obstructive 
pulmonary  disease  (COPD)”  as  initially  proposed  by  the  MAH.    Therefore  the  indication  was  further 
restricted  according  to  the  patient  population  and  data  provided.  The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  indication as 
mentioned “ 
Maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and  a long-acting 
beta2-agonist or a combination  of a long-acting  beta2-agonist and a long-acting  muscarinic 
antagonist  (for effects on symptoms control  and prevention  of exacerbations see section 5.1). 
2.5.  Clinical  safety 
Introduction 
This  section  focuses  on  safety  data  as  generated  in  the  pivotal  study  TRIPLE  8  in  order  to  assess  the 
potential  negative  effects  if  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  is  added  to  dual  treatment  with  bronchodilators  in 
patients  with  advanced  COPD.  These  results  are  considered  to  be  more  important than those obtained in 
study  TRIPLE  7  because  of  the  longer  treatment  duration  (52 weeks vs. 26 weeks) and the study design 
(double-blind,  double-dummy  vs.  open  label).  In  addition,  results  of  the  integrated safety analysis as now 
provided  by  the  applicant  by  pooling  data  from  trials  TRIPLE  5,  TRIPLE  6,  TRIPLE  7  and  TRIPLE  8  are 
discussed.  This  analysis  was  performed  for  TEAEs  only  which  were  at  least  possibly  related  to  treatment 
with CHF 5993 pMDI. 
Patient  exposure 
In  study  TRIPLE  8,  exposure  to  randomised  study  treatment  shows  the  expected  skewed  and  left-tailed 
distribution.  Overall,  the  duration  of  study  treatment  was  as  planned  per  protocol  and  the  proportion  of 
Assessment report

patients  prematurely  discontinuing  the  trial  was  low  and  comparable  between  groups.  Accordingly, 
median  treatment duration  was 365 days in both groups. 
About  88.7%  and  85.4%  of  patients  received  at  least  48  weeks  of  study  treatment  in  groups  CHF5993 
pMDI  and IND/GB,  respectively. 
Table  17: Exposure  to randomised  treatment (safety = ITT population) 
In  study  TRIPLE  7,  the  majority  of  patients  completed  at  least  26  weeks  of  treatment  as  planned  per 
protocol  with  only  33  (5.7%)  patients  in  the  BDP/FF/GB  group  and  30  (5.2%)  patients  in  the 
Fluticasone/Vilanterol  +  Tiotropium  group  discontinuing  the  study.  The  mean  extent  of  exposure  was 
comparable  in  the  BDP/FF/GB  and  Fluticasone/Vilanterol  +  Tiotropium  groups  (178.3  and  179.3  days, 
respectively). 
Adverse events  
Overall  summary of treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) 
Study TRIPLE  8 
With  BDP/FF/GB,  490  (64.1%)  patients  experienced  1292  TEAEs:  117  (15.3%)  patients  were  reported 
with 170 serious TEAEs, 43 (5.6%) patients with 50 ADRs and 1 (0.1%) patient with 1 serious ADR (Table 
18.  A  total  of  86  (11.3%)  patients  were  reported  with  129  severe  TEAEs  and  45  TEAEs  led  to  study 
medication  discontinuation  in  37  (4.8%)  patients.  With  IND/GB,  516  (67.2%)  patients  experienced  1432 
TEAEs:  130  (16.9%)  patients  were  reported  with  208  serious  TEAEs,  37  (4.8%)  patients  with  53  ADRs 
and  1  (0.1%)  patient  with  1  serious  ADR.  A  total of 87 (11.3%) patients were reported with 136 severe 
TEAEs  and  56  TEAEs  led  to  study  medication discontinuation in 47 (6.1%) patients. There were 20 TEAEs 
that  led  to  death  in  16  (2.1%)  patients  with  BDP/FF/GB  and  26  TEAEs  that  led  to  death  in  21  (2.7%) 
patients  with  IND/GB.  None  of  the  deaths  were  considered  related  to  study  treatment.  Most  of  the  fatal 
TEAEs  were  from  the  SOCs  “cardiac  disorders”  (11  TEAEs  in  10  patients)  and  “general  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions”  (11  TEAEs  in  11  patients).  COPD  exacerbation  led  to  the  death  of  2 
patients  (0.3%) in each treatment group.

Table  18: Summary of TEAEs and ADRs (safety = ITT population) 
Study TRIPLE  7 
With  BDP/FF/GB,  255  (44.1%)  patients  experienced  530  TEAEs:  39  (6.7%)  patients  were  reported  with 
63  serious  TEAEs,  18  (3.1%)  patients  with  23  ADRs  and  no  patients  were  reported  with  serious  ADRs 
(Table  24).  A  total of 26 (4.5%) patients were reported with 42 severe TEAEs and 12 TEAEs led to study 
medication  discontinuation  in  11  (1.9%)  patients.  With  Fluticasone/Vilanterol  +  Tiotropium,  246  (42.5%) 
patients  experienced  491  TEAEs:  56  (9.7%)  patients  were  reported  with  87  serious  TEAEs,  22  (3.8%) 
patients  with  30  ADRs  and  no  patients  were  reported  with  serious  ADRs.  A  total  of  32  (5.5%)  patients 
were  reported  with  44  severe  TEAEs  and  14  TEAEs  led  to  study  medication  discontinuation in 13 (2.2%) 
patients. There were 3 TEAEs that led to death in 3 (0.5%) patients with BDP/FF/GB and 6 TEAEs that led 
to death in  5 (0.9%) patients with Fluticasone/Vilanterol  + Tiotropium.

Study TRIPLE  7 
The most common TEAE was COPD exacerbation, reported in 122 (21.1%) and 108 (18.7%) patients with 
BDP/FF/GB  and  Fluticasone/Vilanterol  + Tiotropium, respectively. Other common TEAEs (reported in  ≥ 2% 
patients)  were  nasopharyngitis,  headache,  pneumonia  (PTs  of  bronchopneumonia,  lobar  pneumonia, 
pneumonia  and  pneumonia  staphylococcal),  respiratory  tract  infection  viral,  dyspnoea  and  oral 
candidiasis.  The  majority  of  these  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  resolved  by  the  end  of 
the study.

Deaths 
In  study  TRIPLE  8,  there  were  20  TEAEs  leading  to  death reported in 16 (2.1%) patients with BFP/FF/GB 
and  26  TEAEs  leading  to  death  reported  in  21  (2.7%)  patients  with  IND/GB.  The  most  common  TEAEs 
leading  to  death  were  from  the  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site  Conditions  and  Cardiac 
Disorders  SOCs.  In  both  SOCs  the  frequency  of  events  was  lower  with  BFP/FF/GB  than  with  IND/GB.  Of 
note,  COPD  exacerbation  led  to  death  in  2  (0.3%)  patients  in  each  treatment group. None of the deaths 
were considered related  to study treatment.

In  study  TRIPLE  7,  there  were  3  TEAEs  leading  to  death  reported  in  3  (0.5%)  patients  with  BFP/FF/GB 
and  6  TEAEs  leading  to  death  reported  in  5  (0.9%)  patients  with Fluticasone/Vilanterol + Tiotropium. The 
only  TEAE  leading  to  death  reported  in  ≥  2  patients  in  either  treatment  group  was  COPD  exacerbation, 
which  led  to  death  in  2  (0.3%)  patients  in  the  Fluticasone/Vilanterol  +  Tiotropium  group.  None  of  the 
deaths were considered related  to study treatment. 
Other Serious  Adverse Events 
In  study  TRIPLE  8,  170  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  in  117  (15.3%)  patients  with  BDP/FF/GB  and  208 
serious  TEAEs  were  reported  in  130  (16.9%)  patients  with  IND/GB.  The  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs 
reported  in  ≥  2  patients  by  PT  in  either  treatment  group  is  presented  in  decreasing  order  of  frequency  in

Table  22: Serious  TEAEs reported  in  ≥ 2 patients  by PT, Safety population  –Study Triple  8 
The  majority  of  serious  TEAEs  by  PT  were  reported  in  ≤  2  patients  in  either  treatment  group.  Those 
reported  in  >  2  patients  were  COPD  exacerbation,  pneumonia,  acute  myocardial  infarction,  atrial 
fibrillation,  death,  lung  neoplasm  malignant,  myocardial  infarction,  respiratory  failure,  atrial  flutter  and 
sudden  cardiac  death.  Only  one  serious  TEAE  in  each  group  was  assessed as related to study treatment: 
one  event  of  dysuria in the BDP/FF/GB group, which led to study treatment interruption and was resolved 
before  study  discontinuation  due  to  withdrawal  of  consent,  and  one  event  of  atrial  fibrillation  in  the 
IND/GB  group,  which  did  not  lead  to  study  treatment  modification  and  was  not  resolved  before  study 
participation  ended. 
In  study  TRIPLE  7, 63 serious TEAEs were reported in 39 (6.7%) patients with BDP/FF/GB and 87 serious 
TEAEs  were reported in  56 (9.7%) patients with Fluticasone/Vilanterol  + Tiotropium.   
The  majority  of  serious  TEAEs  by  PT  were  reported  in  ≤  2  patients  in  either  treatment  group.  Those 
reported  in  >  2  patients  were  COPD  exacerbation,  pneumonia  (PTs  of  lobar  pneumonia,  pneumonia  and 
pneumonia  staphylococcal) and respiratory  failure. 
Other Significant  Adverse Events - pneumonia 
Study TRIPLE  8 
There  were  32  events  of  treatment-emergent  pneumonia  (including  PTs  of  bronchopneumonia, interstitial 
lung  disease,  lobar  pneumonia,  pneumonia,  pneumonia  bacterial,  pneumonia  streptococcal,  pneumonia 
viral  and  pulmonary  tuberculosis)  reported in 28 (3.7%) patients with BDP/FF/GB and 29 events reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/910019/2019 
Page 48/62 
 
  
  
 
in  27  (3.5%)  patients  with  IND/GB.  Only  one  confirmed  event  of  pulmonary  tuberculosis was reported in 
1 (0.1%) patient with IND/GB  and  none with BDP/FF/GB (Table  23).  
Table  23: Treatment-emergent pneumonias  and pneumonia  rates (safety = ITT  population) 
The majority of reported pneumonias were moderate in intensity and most of them resolved by the end of 
the  study.  A total of 18 serious pneumonias were reported in 18 (2.4%) patients with BDP/FF/GB and 18 
serious  pneumonias  were  reported  in  17  (2.2%)  patients  with  IND/GB.  None  of  the  serious  pneumonias 
were  considered  related  to  the  study  treatment  and  one  non-serious  pneumonia  of  moderate  intensity 
with  BDP/FF/GB  was  considered  related  to  the  study  treatment.  Of  note,  the  treatment-related  event  of 
pneumonia  reported above was also assessed as possibly caused by a severe acute respiratory  syndrome. 
Three  events  of  pneumonia  led  to  study  medication  discontinuation in  3  (0.4%) patients with BPD/FF/GB 
and  one  event  in  one  (0.1%)  patient with IND/GB. Of these, 2 events of pneumonia in 2 (0.3%) patients 
in  the  BDP/FF/GB  group  and  one  event  in  one  (0.1%)  patient  in  the  IND/GB  group  led  to death and one 
event  of  pneumonia  in  the  BDP/FF/GB  group  was  assessed  as  ‘not  verified’  by  the  site  and  the  patient 
died  from an unknown cause. 
The  pneumonia  rate  per  1,000  patients  per  year  was  comparable  with  BDP/FF/GB  and IND/GB (44.6 vs. 
41.0). 
With  both  treatments,  most  cases  were  classified  by  investigators  to  be  community-acquired.  Only  one 
non-serious  pneumonia  of  moderate  intensity  was  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be  related  to  the 
study treatment (one patient  in group CHF 5993 pMDI). 
Study TRIPLE  7 
There  were  13  events  of  treatment-emergent  pneumonia  (including  PTs  of  bronchopneumonia,  lobar 
pneumonia,  pneumonia  and  pneumonia  staphylococcal)  reported  in  11  (1.9%)  patients  with  BDP/FF/GB 
and  15  events  reported  in  15  (2.6%)  patients  with  Fluticasone/Vilanterol  +  Tiotropium.  The  majority  of 
reported  pneumonias  were  moderate  in  intensity  and  most  of  them  resolved  by  the  end  of  the  study.  A 
total  of  9  serious  pneumonias  were  reported  in  8  (1.4%)  patients  with  BDP/FF/GB  and  11  serious 
pneumonias  were  reported  in  11  (1.9%)  patients  with  Fluticasone/Vilanterol  +  Tiotropium.  None  were 
considered  related  to  the  study  treatment.  One  event  of  pneumonia  led  to  study  medication 
discontinuation  in  one  (0.2%)  patient  and  one  event  of  pneumonia  led  to  death  in  1 (0.2%) patient with 
Fluticasone/Vilanterol  + Tiotropium. 
Assessment report  
EMA/910019/2019

The  pneumonia  rate  per  1,000  patients  per  year  was  slightly  lower  with  BDP/FF/GB  (44.2)  than  with 
Fluticasone/Vilanterol  + Tiotropium  (50.6). 
Other Significant  Adverse Events - cardiovascular  safety 
Study TRIPLE  8 
About  60%  of  patients  of  the  safety  population were reported to suffer from vascular disorders (452 pa-
tients  [59.2%]  in  group  CHF  5993  pMDI  and  480  patients  [62.5%]  in  group  IND/GB),  with hypertension 
being  the  most  frequent  PT  (54.6%  and  57.8%  of  patients,  respectively).  Pre-existing  cardiac  disorders 
were  reported  in  198  patients  (25.9%)  of  group  CHF  5993  pMDI  group  and  214  patients  (27.9%)  in 
group IND/GB  group. 
A  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  groups  CHF5993  pMDI  and  IND/GB  experienced  any  cardiovascular 
event (11.0% vs. 12.5%, respectively).   
The  most  frequently  reported  cardiovascular  events  were  cardiac  failures,  with  19  events  in  group 
CHF5993  pMDI and 18 events in group IND/GB group and arrhythmias, with 20 events in group CHF5993 
pMDI  and  24  events  in  group  IND/GB  group.  Most  arrhythmias  were  of  the  tachycardia-type  (6  and  4 
events,  respectively).  None  of  these  cardiovascular  events  was considered related to treatment with CHF 
5993 pMDI. 
Laboratory  findings 
Study TRIPLE  8 
Overall,  changes  in  all  haematology  and  biochemistry  parameters  from  screening  to  both  Week  26  and 
Week  52  were  minimal  with  BDP/FF/GB  and  IND/GB,  with  no  major  differences  between  treatments.  CS 
abnormalities  in  haematology  parameters,  which  were  associated  with  serious  TEAEs,  were  reported  in 2 
patients  with  BDP/FF/GB  (PTs:  bladder  transitional  cell  carcinoma  and  Hodgkin’s  disease).  Neither  of 
these  serious  TEAEs  were  considered  related  to  study  treatment.  CS  abnormalities  in  biochemistry 
parameters,  which were associated with serious TEAEs, were reported in 2 patients with BDP/FF/GB (PTs: 
adenocarcinoma  gastric  and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus).  Neither  of  these  serious  TEAEs  were  considered 
related  to study treatment. 
Study TRIPLE  7 
Overall,  changes  in  all  haematology  and  biochemistry  parameters  from  screening  to  Week  26  were 
minimal  with  BDP/FF/GB  and  Fluticasone/Vilanterol  +  Tiotropium,  with  no  major  differences  between 
treatments.  For  all  haematology  parameters,  the  majority  of patients presented normal or NCS values at 
screening  and  Week  26.  None  of  the  CS  abnormalities  in  haematology  parameters  assessed  during  the 
study  were  reported  as  serious  TEAEs.  Clinically  significant  abnormalities  in  biochemistry  parameters 
were  reported  as  a  serious  TEAE  (PT:  hepatic  enzyme increased) in one (0.2%) patient with BDP/FF/GB; 
this  TEAE was not considered related  to study treatment.

Discontinuation  due to adverse events 
In  study  TRIPLE  8,  TEAEs  leading  to  study  medication  discontinuation were reported in 37 (4.8%) and 47 
(6.1%)  patients  with  BDP/FF/GB  and  IND/GB,  respectively.  The  incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  study 
medication  discontinuation  is  presented  in  Table  25  when  reported  in  ≥  2  patients  by  PT  in  either 
treatment group.

Table  25: TEAEs leading  to study medication  discontinuation  reported  in  ≥ 2 patients  by PT, 
Safety population  – Study Triple  8 
The majority of TEAEs  that led  to study medication discontinuation  by PT were reported in  ≤ 2 patients  in 
either  treatment group; those reported in  > 2 patients  were: 
•  COPD exacerbation which led to study medication discontinuation of 5 (0.7%) and 10 (1.3%) patients 
with BDP/FF/GB and IND/GB,  respectively; 
•  Death  which  led  to  study  medication  discontinuation  of  2  (0.3%)  and  3  (0.4%)  patients  with 
BDP/FF/GB and IND/GB,  respectively; 
•  Acute  myocardial  infarction  which  led  to  study  medication  discontinuation  of  4  (0.5%)  patients  in the 
IND/GB  group; 
• 
• 
Lung  neoplasm  malignant  which  led  to  study  medication  discontinuation  of  3  (0.4%)  and  1  (0.1%) 
patients  with BDP/FF/GB and IND/GB,  respectively; 
Pneumonia  (PTs  of  pneumonia  and  pulmonary  tuberculosis)  which  led  to  study  medication 
discontinuation  of 3 (0.4%) and 1 (0.1%) patients with BDP/FF/GB and IND/GB,  respectively; 
•  Sudden  cardiac  death  which  led  to  study  medication  discontinuation  of  3  (0.4%)  patients  in  the 
IND/GB  group. 
Of  the  101  TEAEs  leading  to  study  medication  discontinuation,  5  were  assessed  to  be  related  to 
treatment;  2  TEAEs  in  2  patients  with  BDP/FF/GB  (one  event  of  dry  cough  and  one  event  of  headache) 
and  3  TEAEs  in  2  patients  with  IND/GB  (one  event  of  eye  allergy,  one  event  of  itching  with  exanthema 
and  one  event  of  itch  on  all  body).  All  these  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  one  event 
resolved by the end of the study (PT: cough).  
In  study TRIPLE  7, TEAEs  leading  to study medication  discontinuation  were reported in  11 (1.9%) and 13 
(2.2%) patients with BDP/FF/GB and Fluticasone/Vilanterol  + Tiotropium,  respectively.   
The majority of TEAEs  that led  to study medication discontinuation  by PT were reported in  ≤ 2 patients  in 
either  treatment group; the only TEAE reported in  > 2 patients  was COPD exacerbation  which led  to study 
medication  discontinuation  of 3 (0.5%) patients  in  each treatment group. 
Assessment report

Of the 26 TEAEs  leading  to study medication  discontinuation,  4 were assessed to be related  to treatment; 
2 TEAEs in  2 patients  with BDP/FF/GB (one event of papule  and one event of urinary  retention) and 2 
TEAEs  in 2 patients  with Fluticasone/Vilanterol  + Tiotropium  (one event of muscle spasms and  one event 
of dysgeusia).  All  these events were mild  or moderate in  intensity  and  resolved by the end of the study. 
Post marketing  experience 
The  following  analysis  refers  to spontaneous reports of ADRs collected for TRIMBOW received by the MAH 
and  its  partners  in  the  period  from  31  July  2017  (i.e.  date  of  first  launch  of  the  product)  to  31  January 
2018 (the reference period). 
The  patient  exposure  in  the  reference  period  was  calculated  from  the  available  sales  volumes  in  the 
countries  where  the  product  is  marketed.  Especially  during  the  initial phase of a product to be launched in 
more  than  one  market,  such  sales  data  may  overestimate  the  actual  exposure  by  assuming  that  all 
wholesaler stocks are dispensed to patients, and also due to the fact that it does not account for patients’ 
non-compliance  with  the  prescribed  amount  of  dispensed  drug  (e.g.  2  puffs  bid).  Finally,  the  product  is 
currently  sold  in  multipacks  containing  either  2  or  3  canisters  each,  thereby  introducing  another  bias  for 
the proper calculation. 
In  the  reference  period,  a  total  number  of  32  Individual  Case  Safety  Reports  (ICSRs,  5  serious  and  27 
non-serious,  including  spontaneous  cases,  literature  cases,  cases  from  regulatory  authorities  and  cases 
from non-interventional  studies) corresponding  to 53 ADRs, were collected. 
No  significant  safety  information  concerning  serious  and  non-serious  ADRs,  fatal  cases,  drug  interactions, 
drug  abuse  or  misuse,  experience  in  special  patient  groups  or  during  pregnancy  or  lactation, or effects of 
long-term treatment has been reported in  the post-marketing experience. 
Overall,  the safety profile  of the product in  COPD patients  is unchanged. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Focus  was  made  on  safety  data  as  generated  in  the  pivotal  study  TRIPLE  8  in  order  to  assess  the 
potential  (negative)  effects  if  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  is  added  to  dual  treatment  with  bronchodilators  in 
patients  with  advanced  COPD.  These  results  are  considered  to  be  more  important than those obtained in 
study  TRIPLE  7  because  of  the  longer  treatment  duration  (52 weeks vs. 26 weeks) and the study design 
(double-blind,  double-dummy  vs.  open  label).  In  addition,  results  of  the  integrated  safety  analysis  were 
provided  by  the  applicant  by  pooling  data  from  trials  TRIPLE  5,  TRIPLE  6,  TRIPLE  7  and  TRIPLE  8.  The 
integrated  safety analysis  was used to update SmPC Section 4.8.  
The  safety  population  supporting  the  extension  of  indication  comprised  a  total  of  764  subjects  treated 
with  the  closed  triple  combination  FF/UMEC/VI  100/62.5/25  in  Study  TRIPLE  8.  About  88.7%  of  those 
patients  received  at  least  48  weeks  of  study  treatment.  Similar  to  prior  studies  patients  with  significant 
cardiovascular  (CV)  disease  were  excluded.  Overall,  the  safety  database  is considered to be adequate for 
the proposed extension of indication. 
The percentage of patients who have had a fatal outcome was in the range expected for this population of 
COPD  patients.  No  consistent  between-groups  differences  or  imbalances  were  noted  for  TEAEs  having 
higher  incidence  rates.  Random  effects  are  most  likely  responsible  for  minor  imbalances  seen  for  TEAEs 
occurring  in  fewer patients. 
Notable,  in  study  TRIPLE  7,  one patient  had  suddenly  and  unexpectedly  died  a few days only after having 
had  an  uneventful  study  visit  3.  The  case  was  reported by the investigator as «respiratory failure», but in 
this  case  autopsy  results  clearly  pointed  towards  an  acute  and  purulent  infection  of the lung as the direct 
cause  of  death.  In  study  TRIPLE  8,  another  patient  was  admitted  to  the  ICU  of  a  remote  hospital  , 
Assessment report  
EMA/910019/2019 
Page 53/62 
 
  
  
underwent  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  and  died  two  days  later.  The  applicant  stated  that  the  event 
term  reported  by  the  investigator  («acute  respiratory  failure»,  coded  PT:  acute  respiratory  failure)  was 
not  challenged,  thus  accepting  the  «primary  cause  of  death».  No  compelling  arguments and well-founded 
epicrisis  were  forwarded  by  the  applicant  why  an  (acute)  infectious  pulmonary event (leading to an acute 
coronary  syndrome)  was  excluded  this  second  patient.  Thus  and  in  conclusion,  based  on  these  two 
examples,  doubts  remain  on  whether  due  care  and  diligence  were  exercised  by  the  applicant  (or  its 
service  providers)  throughout  trial  conduct  in  fully  assessing  fatal  /  serious  events  and  potential  COPD 
exacerbations. 
There  were  32  events  of  treatment-emergent  pneumonia  (including  PTs  of  bronchopneumonia, interstitial 
lung  disease,  lobar  pneumonia,  pneumonia,  pneumonia  bacterial,  pneumonia  streptococcal,  pneumonia 
viral  and  pulmonary  tuberculosis)  reported  in  28  (3.7%)  patients  with  CHF  5993  pMDI  and  29  events 
reported  in  27  (3.5%)  patients  with  IND/GB.  Only  one  confirmed  event  of  pulmonary  tuberculosis  was 
reported  in  one  (0.1%)  patient  with  IND/GB  and  none  with  CHF  5993  pMDI.  The  majority  of  reported 
pneumonias  were moderate in intensity and most of them resolved by the end of the study. A total of 18 
serious  pneumonias  were  reported  in  18  (2.4%)  patients  with  BDP/FF/GB  and  18  serious  pneumonias 
were  reported  in  17  (2.2%)  patients  with  IND/GB.  None  of  the  serious  pneumonias  were  considered 
related  to  the  study  treatment  and  one  non-serious  pneumonia  of  moderate  intensity  with  BDP/FF/GB 
was considered related  to the study treatment. 
ICS-containing  treatments  are  known  to  increase  the  risk of pneumonia in COPD patients. This signal was 
first  reported  in  a  large  clinical  trial  of  3  years  treatment  duration,  comparing  a  fluticasone 
propionate/salmeterol  combination  with  its  component  parts  and  placebo  (TORCH  study,  Calverley  et  al 
2007). Based on its results, the CHMP Pharmacovigilance Working Party concluded in 2010 that treatment 
with  an  ICS,  either  alone  or  in  combination  with  a  LABA,  increases  the  risk  of  pneumonia in patients with 
COPD. 
On 27 April 2015, the European Commission triggered a referral under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The  PRAC  review  confirms  that  COPD  patients  treated with inhaled corticosteroids are at increased risk of 
pneumonia;  however  the  Committee’s  view  is  that  the  benefits  of  inhaled  corticosteroids  continue  to 
outweigh  their  risks.  The  PRAC  also  looked  whether  there  were  any  differences  in  the  risk  of  pneumonia 
between  these  products,  and  did  not  find  conclusive  evidence  of  such  difference.  In  addition,  update  of 
the  product  information  including  a  specific  warning  in  SmPC  Section  4.4  was  requested  for  all  ICS 
containing  products with a COPD indication  to adequately reflect  the current knowledge.  
The  provided  data  on  pneumonia  are  not  suggestive  of  a relevantly increased risk of pneumonia when an 
ICS  is  added  to  double  bronchodilator  therapy.  In  study  TRIPLE  8,  the  pneumonia  event  rate  per  1’000 
subject-years  under  triple  therapy  (44.6)  was  slightly  higher  than  those  observed  in  the  pivotal  trials 
endorsing  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  (TRIPLE  5:  38.9;  TRIPLE  6:  29.2).  However,  in  contrast  to 
other  studies  comparing  ICS/LABA/LAMA  (e.g.  Lipson  DA  at  al.  2018),  no higher risk was observed when 
adding  an  ICS  to  double  bronchodilator  therapy  (IND/GB:  41.0).  The  interpretation  of  these 
observations  is  somehow  difficult,  but  most  likely  the  sample  size/statistical  power  of  TRIPLE 
8  was  not  large  enough  to  detect  a  difference  among  groups,  even  if  one  may  have  been 
present.  Thus,  at  the  time  being  no  firm  conclusions  can  be  drawn  given  the  limited  nature  of 
the data.  
About  60%  of  patients  of  the  safety  population  were  reported  to  suffer  from  vascular  disorders  (452 
patients  [59.2%]  in  group  CHF  5993  pMDI  and  480  patients  [62.5%]  in  group  IND/GB),  with 
hypertension  being  the  most  frequent  PT  (54.6%  and  57.8%  of  patients,  respectively).  Pre-existing 
cardiac disorders were reported in 198 patients (25.9%) of group CHF 5993 pMDI group and 214 patients 
(27.9%) in the IND/GB  group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/910019/2019 
Page 54/62 
 
  
  
As  mentioned  earlier,  inclusion/  exclusion  criteria  excluded  patients  with  clinically  significant  cardio-
vascular  conditions  from  study  participation.  Also,  in  contrast  to  studies  TRIPLE  5  and  TRIPLE  6,  the 
composite endpoint “major adverse cardiovascular  events (MACE)” was not (centrally) adjudicated. 
A  slightly  higher  incidence  in  older  patients  was  observed  in  the  analyses  considering  all  TEAEs  (category 
“Total  AEs”)  and  nervous  system  disorders  while  no  clear  signal  of  an  increased  risk  with  increasing  age 
was found for any of the other categories of TEAEs. 
The  incidences  of  the  treatment  discontinuations  in  both  studies  are  balanced  across  the  different 
treatment groups. 
Based  on  the  safety  data  submitted,  the  following  additional  ADRs  are  proposed  for  inclusion  in  the 
TRIMBOW  SmPC:  pharyngeal  erythema,  pharyngeal  inflammation  and  dry  throat  (SOC:  Respiratory, 
Thoracic  and  Mediastinal  Disorders),  (aphthous)  stomatitis  (SOC:  Gastrointestinal  Disorders).  In  addition, 
changes  in  frequency  are  proposed  for  the  following  existing  ADRs  in the TRIMBOW -SmPC, based on the 
frequency  reported  in  studies  TRIPLE  5,  TRIPLE  6,  TRIPLE  7  and  TRIPLE  8:  hypertension  from  “rare”  to 
“uncommon”;  dysuria  and  urinary  retention  from  “uncommon”  to  “rare”  and  asthenia from “uncommon” 
to “rare”, respectively.  This  is acceptable  and supported by the safety data provided in  the application. 
Additionally  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC,  a  paragraph  on  the  risk  of  visual  disturbance  is  added  following 
beclometasone PSUSA/00000306/201612 procedure and the PRAC recommendation dated July 2018. The 
ADR table  in  section 4.8 is updated  accordingly.   
2.5.2.  Conclusions  on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  in  study  TRIPLE  8  was  in  line  with  the  pharmacologic  class  of  each 
component  and  with  the  dual  combination  IND/GB.  The  known  risk  of  pneumonia  with  ICS-containing 
products in  COPD patients  has to be taken into account when balancing  the benefit  against  the risk.   
The requirements  for submission  of periodic  safety update reports for this  medicinal  product are set out in 
the list  of Union  reference dates (EURD list)  provided  for under  Article  107c(7) of Directive  2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent  updates published  on the European  medicines  web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management  plan

Having  considered  the data submitted,  the CHMP agrees that Routine pharmacovigilance  is sufficient  to 
identify  and characterise  the risks of the product.  The CHMP also considered  that Routine PhV remains 
sufficient  to monitor the effectiveness  of the risk minimisation  measures.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication,  sections 4.1 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated.  In 
addition,  a new warning  with regard  to the risk  of visual  disturbance  associated with beclometasone has 
been added to the product information.  The Package Leaflet  has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation

been submitted  by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following  reasons: The changes are 
minimal  and would not affect the results  of the original  user consultation 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic  Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
TRIMBOW  is  a  triple  combination  of  an  ICS,  LABA  and  LAMA.  The  product  is  a  fixed  dose  combination  of 
BDP,  FF  and  GB  and  formulated  as  a  HFA  solution  to  be  delivered  via  a  pMDI  with  a  nominal  dose  per 
actuation of BDP, FF and GB of 100 µg, 6 µg and 12.5 µg, respectively. 
The approved indication  is: 
“Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD)  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a  long-acting 
beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention  of exacerbations see section 5.1).” 
COPD  is  a  progressive  disease  characterised  by  increasing  obstruction  to  airflow  and  the  progressive 
development  of  respiratory  symptoms  including  chronic  cough,  increased  sputum  production,  dyspnoea 
and  wheezing. The objective of pharmacological treatment of is to prevent and control symptoms, reduce 
the frequency and  severity of exacerbations, and improve general  health  status and exercise  tolerance. 
Smoking  cessation  (including  passive  smoking)  is  extremely  important.  Ideally  treatment  of  COPD  would 
slow  its  progression  but  this  has  never  been  convincingly  demonstrated.  Long  term  domiciliary  oxygen 
has  been  shown  to  prolong  life  but  confines  the  patient  to  home  for  protracted  periods.  In  recent  years 
there  has  been  increasing  emphasis  on  physical  training  and  rehabilitation.  Moderate  and  severe  COPD 
exacerbations  are  generally  treated  with  antibiotics  and  oral  corticosteroids.  Maintenance  treatment  is  by 
combinations of oral and inhaled  bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory  agents. 
3.1.1.  Available  therapies and unmet medical need 
Despite  the  availability  of  a  multiplicity  of pharmacological treatments none of them modifies the progress 
of the disease and none can be considered to have a really major benefit on its most common symptoms 
of cough, breathlessness,  excess sputum production,  and thoracic discomfort due to hyperinflation. 
ICS/LABA  combination  products  are  considered  key  to  the  symptomatic  management  of  COPD.  The 
combination  has  been  shown  to  improve  lung  function,  health  status,  and  to  reduce COPD exacerbations 
compared  with  either  agent  alone.  LAMAs  have  been  shown  to  improve  lung  function, relieve symptoms, 
increase  exercise  capacity,  improve  quality  of  life,  and  reduce  COPD  exacerbations  to  a  greater  extent 
than  short-acting  bronchodilators.  As  disease  severity  increases,  COPD  treatment  guidelines  recommend 
an  incremental  approach  to  pharmacological  treatment,  involving  the  use  of combinations of drug classes 
with different  or complementary mechanisms of action (GOLD 2018). 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
The  main  phase  3  clinical  study  supporting  this  extension  of  indication  is  one  pivotal  study  (study  TRIPLE 
8).  In  this  randomised,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  2-arm  parallel  group  study  involving  1532  patients 
with  COPD,  the  fixed  combination  of  BDP/FF/GB  were  compared  with  the  dual  combination  IND/GB  over 
52 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks 
of treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/910019/2019 
Page 57/62 
 
  
  
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  Study  TRIPLE  8  were  consistent  with  those  from  Study  TRIPLE  5 
and study TRIPLE  6 which were pivotal  for the initial  MAA.  
3.2.  Favourable  effects 
The  currently  approved  indication  wording  “…[COPD  patients]  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a 
combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a  long-acting  β2-agonist”  highlights  the  lack  of  evidence  to 
claim  a  step-up  indication  from  the  combination  of  a  long-acting  muscarinic  receptor  antagonist  (LAMA) 
and  a  long-acting  beta2  agonist  (LABA)  due  to  the  absence  of  the  combination  of  LAMA  and  LABA  as 
comparator  (e.g.  IND/GB)  in  the  pivotal  Phase  III  study  at  time  of  the  initial  MAA  of  TRIMBOW,  a  triple 
combination of an inhaled  corticosteroid (ICS), and LABA and  LAMA. 
In  study  TRIPLE  8  the  MAH  demonstrates  advantages  for  the  fixed  combination  of  BDP/FF/GB  over  the 
dual  therapy  IND/GB  in  symptomatic  COPD patients with a risk of exacerbation. In the ITT population, the 
rate  of  moderate-to-severe  COPD  exacerbations over 52 weeks of treatment was significantly lower with 
BDP/FF/GB  than  with  IND/GB,  with  a  rate  ratio  of  0.848  (95%  CI  [0.723,  0.995],  p-value=0.043) 
indicating  a  15%  reduction  in  the  exacerbation  rate.  While  the  applicant  has  indeed  demonstrated  the 
superiority  of  the  triple  combination over the dual components, the data does not support the broadening 
of  the  indication  for  use  as  a  first-line  therapy  as  initially  requested  by  the  MAH.  The  use  of  the  triple 
combination  is  currently  recommended  only  as  a  step-up  from  dual  therapy  (either  ICS/LABA  or 
LABA/LAMA). 
3.3.  Uncertainties  and limitations  about  favourable effects 
Notable,  the  p-value  of  the  primary  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  (ITT  dataset)  are  slightly  less  than 
the  conventional  0.05  significance  level  (p=0.043).  The  upper  limit  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  adjusted 
exacerbation  rate  ratio  was  0.995.  Results  of  the  PP  population  confirmed  the  estimated  effect  size,  but 
barely  missed statistical  significance  (p=0.050, upper  limit  of 95% CI=1.000).  
The  consistency  of  statistical  significance  is  not  guaranteed  over  a  broad  range  of  primary  analyses  and 
sensitivity  analyses.  The  following  analyses  do  not  or  did  not  yield  a  significant  result  at  a  p-level  of 
<0.05: 
- time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (p=0.219); 
- FEV1 responder analysis  (change from baseline  to week 52 ≥100 mL; p=0.198); 
- missing  data imputation  for COPD exacerbation rate (CR, J2R); 
- use of other time gaps in  order to decide whether two (or more) episodes represent a single 
 (or new) exacerbation episode (15 or 20 days) 
- SGRQ responder analysis  (change from baseline  to week 52 ≤-4 units; p=0.068) 
The  difference  in  moderate-to-severe  COPD  exacerbations  over  52  weeks,  in  absolute  terms  (an 
estimated  reduction  in  0.09  exacerbations  per  patient  per  year,  from  0.594  with  LABA/LAMA  to  0.504 
with  the  triple  therapy),  is  considered  modest  from  a  clinical  perspective.  Nevertheless,  it  is  conceded 
that  the  chosen  study  design  and  population  –  in  contrast  to  other  recently  published  studies  -  did  not 
penalise  the  comparator  group  nor  did  it  inflate  artificially  the  rate  of  moderate  and  severe  COPD 
exacerbations.  
Doubts  have  emerged  regarding  the  internal  validity  and  data  quality  of  the  study.  As  is  only  now 
apparent  from  the  requested  documentation  which  was  not  submitted  with  the  initial  application  (i.e.  the 
so-called  Data  Review  Report),  that    the  secondary  population  for  analysis  (i.e.  the  per-protocol 
population)  modified  after  unblinding.  Though  these  post  hoc  modifications  applied  to  the  PP  population 
Assessment report  
EMA/910019/2019 
Page 58/62 
 
  
  
appear  to  have  had  no  impact  on  the  analysis  of  the primary response variable, they raised doubts as to 
the  quality  of  reported  data  and  the  understanding  of  the  applicant  for  GCP  requirements  and  disclosure 
obligations  of an applicant  in the context of a marketing authorisation  procedure. 
In  addition,  the  MAH  has  undertaken  limited  efforts  to  assess  and  assure  the  reliability  and  integrity  of 
the  trial  systems  against  own  written  standards  and  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  Annual  audit  plans  / 
programmes  were  finalised  with  significant  delay  and  for  the  pivotal  study  TRIPLE  8,  only  a  single  site 
audit  was  performed  that  followed  a  proactive  and  risk-based  approach.  This  finding  also challenged  the 
internal  validity  of the study / data reliability  during  the assessment. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  of  BDP/FF/GB  in  study  TRIPLE  8  was  in  line  with  the  pharmacologic  class  of  each 
component  and  also  with  the  comparator  IND/GB.  Based  on  the  additional  data  provided  in  the 
application,  the  following  additional  ADRs  are  proposed  for  inclusion  in  the  TRIMBOW  label:  pharyngeal 
erythema,  pharyngeal  inflammation  and  dry  throat  (SOC:  Respiratory,  Thoracic  and  Mediastinal 
Disorders),  (aphthous)  stomatitis  (SOC:  Gastrointestinal  Disorders).  In  addition,  changes in frequency are 
proposed  for  the  following  existing  ADRs  in  the  TRIMBOW  label,  based  on  the  frequency  reported  in 
studies  TRIPLE  5,  TRIPLE  6,  TRIPLE  7  and  TRIPLE  8:  hypertension  from  “rare”  to  “uncommon”;  dysuria 
and urinary  retention  from “uncommon” to “rare” and asthenia from “uncommon” to “rare”, respectively. 
Overall,  the  AE  profile  of  TRIMBOW  is  well  understood;  none  of  the  active  substances  is  a  new  active 
substance  and  all  have  been  used  over  periods  of at least years individually and in combination in treating 
COPD  patients  of  various  grades  of  severity.  To  date,  3106  patients  have  been  treated  with  the  triple 
combination (counting the free and fixed combinations) many of them for 52 weeks. There are no evident 
new  safety  signals  and  the  treatment  associated  unwanted  effects  are  of  a  frequency  and  nature  to  be 
expected given  the nature of the clinical  development.  
Pneumonia  data  collected  for  Trimbow®  in  study  TRIPLE  8  and  previous  trials  are  not  suggestive  of  a 
relevantly  increased  risk  of  pneumonia  when  BDP  is  added  to  a  LABA  LAMA  combination. In study TRIPLE 
8,  the  pneumonia  event  rate  per  1’000  subject-years  under  triple  therapy (44.6) was slightly higher than 
those  observed  in  the  pivotal  trials  endorsing  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  (TRIPLE  5:  38.9;  TRIPLE 
6:  29.2). However,  no  firm  conclusions can be drawn in that respect given the limited nature of the data. 
Due  to  the  low  observed  event  rate,  study  TRIPLE  8  (32  pneumonia  events)  and  the  pooled  analysis 
integrating  data  from  studies  TRIPLE  5  to  TRIPLE  8  (100  pneumonia  events)  only  had  low  statistical 
power  to  generate  a  robust  estimate  of  the  true  risk  of  pneumonia.  Moreover,  data  and  analyses 
presented  are  not  sufficient  to  establish  whether  the  risk  of  pneumonia  of  an  ICS-containing  regimen 
varies  with  the corticosteroid moiety and/or the formulation itself. Latest scientific data generated in 2015 
in  the  framework  of  the  referral  triggered  by  the  European  Commission  confirmed  the  risk  of pneumonia 
with  these  combination  products,  but  did  not  find  any  conclusive  evidence  of  differences  in  this  risk  for 
different  products.  Differences  in  study  design,  methodology  for  confirming  the  diagnosis  of  pneumonia, 
sample  size  and  populations  assessed  also  do  not  allow  drawing  meaningful  conclusions  of  whether 
Trimbow®  has  a  more  favourable  benefit-risk  profile  in  that  respect  than  the triple combination assessed 
in  the IMPACT  study.

3.2.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.2.1.  Importance  of favourable  and unfavourable  effects 
For  patients  at  risk  of  COPD  exacerbations,  the  Global  Initiative  for  Chronic  Obstructive  Lung  Disease 
(GOLD)  strategy  document  for  the  management  of  patients  with  COPD  recommends  an  incremental 
approach  to  therapy,  beginning  with  either  a  LAMA,  LAMA/LABA,  or  ICS/LABA  therapy  [GOLD,  2018].  If 
patients  develop  further  exacerbations,  escalation  of  pharmacologic  therapy  is  recommended.  For 
example,  patients  on  LAMA  therapy  can  be  switched  to  a LAMA/LABA or ICS/LABA with further escalation 
to triple  ICS/LAMA/LABA  therapy or those on a dual  therapy can be switched to triple  therapy  if required. 
In  other  words,  triple  therapy  is  currently  thought  to  be  best  used  as  an  escalation  therapy  for  those 
incompletely  controlled  with  dual  therapy,  either  ICS/LABA  or  LABA/LAMA  (GOLD  2018).  While  the 
applicant  has  indeed  demonstrated  the  superiority  (although  marginal  statistically  significant)  of  the  triple 
combination  over  LAMA/LABA  combination,  the data does not support the broadening of the indication for 
use  as  a  first-line  therapy  (i.e.  “Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary  disease (COPD)”) as initially  proposed by the MAH.  
The  indication  was  therefore  discussed  and  is  agreed  as  follows  (additions  in  bold)  “Maintenance 
treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  who 
are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and a long-acting beta2-agonist

or  a  combination  of  a  long-acting  beta2-agonist  and  a  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist  (for 
effects on symptoms control and prevention  of exacerbations see section 5.1). 
From  a safety point of view, the provided data on pneumonia are not suggestive of a relevantly increased 
risk  of  pneumonia  when  an  ICS  is  added  to  double  bronchodilator  therapy.  In  contrast  to  other  studies 
comparing  ICS/LABA/LAMA  (e.g.  Lipson  DA at al. 2018), no higher risk was observed when adding an ICS 
to  double  bronchodilator  therapy.  However,  the  interpretation  of  these  observations  is somehow difficult, 
but  most  likely  the  sample  size/statistical  power  of  TRIPLE  8  was not large enough to detect a difference 
among groups, even if  one may have been present.    
3.2.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Although  the  effect  on  exacerbation  rate  is  marginal  statistically  significant  and  modest  from  a  clinical 
perspective,  the  applicant  has  sufficiently  shown  that  the  decrease  in  exacerbations  demonstrated  is 
sufficient  to  offset  the  well-known  rate  of  pneumonia  in  patients  taking  an  ICS  containing  triple  therapy 
compared to patients on dual  LABA/LAMA  therapy in  patients with  moderate to severe COPD.  
3.2.3.  Additional  considerations  on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.3.  Conclusions 
The overall  B/R of TRIMBOW in  the extended indication  is  positive.   
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  considers  the  following  variation  acceptable  and 
therefore  recommends  by  consensus  the  variation  to  the  terms  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation, 
concerning  the following  change: 
Variation  accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a   
C.I.6.a  - Change(s) to therapeutic  indication(s)  - Addition 
Type II 
I,  IIIA  and 
of a new therapeutic  indication  or modification  of an 
IIIB 
approved one  
Extension  of  indication,  based  on  results  from  two  Phase  III  studies:  Triple  7  (CCD-05993AA1-07)  and 
Triple 8 (CCD-05993AA1-08), to include maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe 
chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  who  are  not adequately treated by combination of a long-
acting  beta2-agonist  and  a  long-acting muscarinic antagonist. Sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
are  updated  accordingly  to  reflect  the  studies’  results  and  add  a  new  warning  with  regards  to  the  risk  of 
visual 
disturbance 
associated  with 
beclometasone 
following 
the  PSUSA 
recommendation 
PSUSA/00000306/201612.  The  package  leaflet  and  the  risk  management  plan (version 6.0) are updated 
accordingly.  Additionally  changes  to  annex  IIIA  are  introduced  in  the  Braille  section  to  bring  in  line  with 
the QRD template.

medicinal  product 
Risk management  plan (RMP) 
The  MAH  shall  perform  the  required  pharmacovigilance  activities  and  interventions  detailed  in  the  agreed 
RMP  presented  in  Module  1.8.2  of  the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
In  addition,  an updated  RMP should  be submitted: 
At the request of the European  Medicines  Agency; 
Whenever  the  risk  management  system  is  modified,  especially  as  the  result  of  new  information  being 
received  that  may  lead  to  a  significant  change  to  the  benefit/risk  profile  or  as  the  result  of  an  important 
(pharmacovigilance  or risk minimisation)  milestone  being  reached.   
5.  EPAR changes 
The  EPAR  will  be  updated  following  Commission  Decision  for  this  variation.  In  particular  the  EPAR  module 
8 "steps after the authorisation"  will  be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of indication,  based on results  from two Phase III  studies: Triple  7 (CCD-05993AA1-07) and 
Triple  8 (CCD-05993AA1-08), to include  maintenance  treatment in  adult  patients with moderate to severe 
chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (COPD) who are not adequately  treated by combination of a long-
acting  beta2-agonist and a long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist. Sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and  5.1 of the SmPC

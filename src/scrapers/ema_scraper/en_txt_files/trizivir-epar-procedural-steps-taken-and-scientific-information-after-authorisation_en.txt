Update of section 5.2 of the SmPC in order to add 
new information on the elimination half-life of 
lamivudine, based on final results from studies 
204993 and 204994. Study 204993 was a phase I,

dose combinations of dolutegravir and lamivudine in 
healthy subjects. Study 204994 was an open-label,

reviewed indicated a terminal elimination half-life for 
lamivudine of 18-19 hours.

Triumeq/ Trizivir to the individual components in patients 
with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who 
received dose-adjusted lamivudine. In the original 
lamivudine registrational trials in combination with 
zidovudine, higher lamivudine exposures were associated 
with higher rates of haematologic toxicities (neutropenia 
and anaemia), although discontinuations due to 
neutropenia or anaemia each occurred in <1% of subjects. 
Other lamivudine-related adverse events (such as gastro-
intestinal and hepatic disorders) may occur. 
The CHMP considered that, with the exception of Epivir, the 
previous recommendations to adjust the dose in patients 
with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 
mL/min can be removed. 
Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 
and 49 mL/min who receive Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ 
Triumeq/ Trizivir should be monitored for lamivudine-
related adverse events, notably haematologic toxicities. If 
new or worsening neutropenia or anaemia develop, a dose 
adjustment of lamivudine, per lamivudine prescribing 
information, is indicated, which cannot be achieved with 
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir.  
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir should be 
discontinued and the individual components should be used 
to construct the treatment regimen. 
The existing dose recommendations for Epivir have been 
maintained. The CHMP considered the lack of impact on pill 
burden when the lamivudine dose is adjusted for a 
monocomponent product and the fact that dose 
adjustments may be still used for subjects initially treated 
with lamivudine-containing fixed dose combinations, but 
requiring dose-adjusted individual components

(CYP1A1 substrate) to HIV patients receiving the 
combination of abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine 
(600mg/50mg/300mg once daily) led to an approximately 
three-fold higher riociguat AUC(0-∞) when compared to 
historical riociguat AUC(0-∞) reported in healthy subjects. 
Therefore, when riociguat is co-administered with abacavir, 
its dose may need to be reduced. Consult the riociguat 
prescribing information for dosing recommendations.

administration of sorbitol containing medicines may reduce 
the exposure of lamivudine, possibly resulting in reduced 
virologic suppression or viral resistance. 
Co-administration of sorbitol solution (3.2 g, 10.2 g, 13.4 
g) with a single 300 mg dose (Adult HIV daily dose) of 
lamivudine oral solution resulted in dose-dependent 
decreases of 14%, 32%, and 36% in lamivudine exposure 
(AUC) and 28%, 52%, and 55% in the Cmax of lamivudine 
in adults. When possible, avoid chronic co-administration of 
Zeffix with medicinal products containing sorbitol or other 
osmotic acting poly-alcohols or monosaccharide alcohols 
(e.g. xylitol, mannitol, lactitol, maltitol). Consider more 
frequent monitoring of HIV-1 viral load when chronic co-
administration cannot be avoided.

to a variable degree, which is most pronounced with 
stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been 
reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV negative infants 
exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside 
analogues; these have predominantly concerned treatment 
with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, 
neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, 
hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. 
Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely 
(hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether 
such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is 
currently unknown. These findings should be considered for 
any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, that 
present with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, 
particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect 
current national recommendations to use antiretroviral 
therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV.

Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC to revise the information on hypersensitivity 
reactions in line with a recent revision of the Triumeq 
SmPC. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) to abacavir sulfate (ABC) 
has been revised to provide a more condensated and less 
redundant description of the HSR to abacavir. The most 
detailed description of the HSR have been kept in section 
4.8 of the SmPC under the “description of the selected

The MAH has submitted a type II variation application to 
the CHMP following the PRAC assessment of 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/3144/201312, to delete the 
description of outdated clinical data regarding the 
comparison between bitherapy and tritherapy. 
Further, a paragraph in section 5.1 of the SmpC 
concerning the comparison with nelfinavir has also 
been deleted. In addition, the MAH has taken this 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in 
the product information, to align the SmPC and 
Package Leaflet with the latest QRD template 
(version 9), and to update the lactic acidosis 
description in the Package Leaflet in line with the 
description provided for Ziagen (abacavir) and 
Kivexa (abacavir/lamivudine).

While it was recognised that the number of cases is small, 
the long and variable time to onset probably causes 
underreporting of such adverse reactions and therefore 
little is known on the exact pathogenesis and the risk

reaction (HSR) against the active substance abacavir at re-
initiation of treatment in a patient who previously had well 
tolerated this medicinal product. However afterwards, this 
patient was tested positive for the gene HLA-B*5701, which 
is associated with a higher HSR risk. There have also been 
case reports of HSR in patients who already had shown 
HSR symptoms before, but were tested HLA-B*5701 
negative. Based on these facts, it was regarded as 
necessary to amend the recommendation for HLA-B*5701 
testing before re-initiation of abacavir treatment and to 
highlight that HSR can also occur in HLA-B*5701 negative 
patients in the Product Information. Regarding the latter 
issue, also the information on HSR incidence was updated 
and is now reflecting the still significant HSR incidence 
obtained for HLA-B*5701 negative patients in recent 
studies which differentiated between HLA-B*5701 negative 
and positive patients.

were limited numbers of myocardial infarction in data from 
clinical trials and a small increase in risk could not be 
excluded. 
The data available so far present some inconsistencies and 
can neither confirm nor refute a causal relationship 
between abacavir treatment and the risk of myocardial 
infarction. 
To date, there is no established biological mechanism to 
explain a potential increase in risk. 
The CHMP concluded that on the basis of the data available 
no recommendation could be made for changing the 
therapeutic management of patients. When prescribing 
Trizivir action should be taken to try to minimize all 
modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, and 
hyperlipidaemia).

5% of patients taking abacavir (ABC). 
Retrospective studies reported a highly significant 
association between HLA-B*5701 allele carriage and ABC 
HSR. The MAH has conducted two new phase IV studies to 
assess the association of HLA-B*5701 and the occurrence 
of ABC HSR as well as the clinical utility of a 
pharmacogenetic pre-screening strategy prior to initiating 
therapy with ABC. 
Results from a prospective study demonstrate that patients 
with the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a significantly higher risk 
of developing an HSR than patients without the HLA-
B*5701 allele (i.e. 48 to 61% of patients with the HLA-
B*5701 allele will develop and HSR versus 0 to 4% in 
patients without the HLA-B*5701 allele). Therefore, HLA-
B*5701 testing should be performed before any initiation of 
abacavir treatment. Moreover, CHMP recommended that 
patients carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele should not be 
considered for the treatment with abacavir. 
Furthermore, results show that skin patch testing fails to 
detect ABC HSR in a subset of patients and therefore 
should not be used in clinical practice for the purpose of 
HSR diagnosis.

(PL) was updated accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and

The MAH has submitted type II variation applications for 
the other medicinal products containing zidovudine 
(Combivir, Lamivudine/Zidovudine GSK and Trizivir) to 
update the information to be in line with the Retrovir SPC 
and PL. 
Furthermore, there is now a lot of evidence from clinical 
trials and from literature that concomitant use of 
zidovudine and ribavirin is associated with a greater risk of 
anaemia. The consensus conference on the treatment of 
HCV/HIV co-infected patients already recommended that 
the use of zidovudine should be avoided due to an excess 
risk of anaemia.

The MAH took the opportunity of this change to

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
SPC has been updated with information on the resistance 
pattern of abacavir, in particular on the mutation pejorative 
to the virological response of abacavir, since this 
information could be clinically helpful. The information is 
now presented for in vitro resistance and for in vivo 
resistance in therapy naïve patients as well as therapy 
experienced patients. Concerning in vivo resistance in 
therapy naïve patients, isolates from most patients 
experiencing virological failure with a regimen containing 
abacavir in pivotal clinical trials showed either no NRTI-
related changes from baseline or only M184V or M184I 
selection. Concerning in vivo resistance in therapy 
experienced patients, a clinically significant reduction of 
susceptibility to abacavir has been demonstrated in clinical 
isolates of patients with uncontrolled viral replication, who 
have been pre-treated with and are resistant to other 
nucleoside inhibitors. Phenotypic resistance to abacavir 
requires M184V with at least one other abacavir-selected 
mutation, or M184V with multiple thymidine analogue 
mutations. The currently recommended resistance 
algorithms can help in the appropriate use of abacavir.

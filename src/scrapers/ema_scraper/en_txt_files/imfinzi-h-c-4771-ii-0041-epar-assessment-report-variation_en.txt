2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with no EGFR or ALK aberrations, regardless of tumoral PD-L1 
expression. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The initially claimed therapeutic indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC was: 
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-line 
treatment  of  adults  with  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  with  no  sensitising  EGFR 
mutations or ALK positive mutations. 
The indication was updated during the procedure to: 
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-
line  treatment  of  adults  with  metastatic  NSCLC  with  no  sensitizing  EGFR  mutations  or  ALK  positive 
mutations. 
Epidemiology  
Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and remains the leading cause of cancer 
death around the globe (Sung et al 2021; GLOBOCAN 2021). In Europe, an estimated 312,645 patients 
were foreseen to be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2021, accounting for approximately 25% of all cancer 
diagnoses, and an estimated 267,700 lung cancer associated deaths were foreseen to occur, accounting 
for approximately one in 5 cancer related mortalities (Lung Cancer Europe 2021). In the US, an estimated 
235,760 new cases of lung cancer were foreseen to be diagnosed in 2021, accounting for about 25% of 
all cancer diagnoses, and an estimated 131,880 lung cancer associated deaths will occur, accounting for 
approximately 1 in 4 cancer related mortalities (American Cancer Society 2021). 
Biologic features 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises approximately 85% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer 
cases.   It includes several histological subtypes of  which non-squamous (e.g.,  adenocarcinoma,  large 
cell carcinoma) and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common (Aisner and Marshall 2012).   
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Despite advances made in screening, early detection, and staging, the majority of lung cancer patients 
are diagnosed when the disease has advanced into the metastatic stage and is not amenable to 
surgical resection (Herbst et al 2018).  Furthermore, a significant percentage of patients with early 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 8/119 
 
 
  
 
 
stage NSCLC who have undergone surgery subsequently develop distant recurrence and die as a result 
of their metastatic disease (Pisters and Le Chevalier 2005). 
Management 
The  first  line  (1L)  treatment  of  metastatic  NSCLC  has  evolved  from  the  empirical  use  of  cytotoxic 
chemotherapies based on physician’s preference to a hallmark of personalized medicine, with subsets of 
patients treated according to the genetic alterations of their tumour and the status of programmed cell 
death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which predict for benefit from targeted therapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(ICIs), respectively (Herbst et al 2018; Peters et al 2019). 
In the past 5 years, substantial progress has been made in the frontline treatment of metastatic NSCLC 
with  immunotherapy-based  regimens  demonstrating  improved  outcomes  in  this  patient  population 
(NCCN  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  in  Oncology  Version  1.2020;  ESMO  Guidelines  Committee  2019). 
Treatment selection in clinical practice is usually based on PD-L1 expression or histology. For patients 
with high PD-L1 expression (i.e., PD-L1 expressed in ≥50% of tumour cells), monotherapy with either 
pembrolizumab or atezolizumab or cemiplimab are acceptable and EMA-approved choices. Conversely, 
regardless  of  PD-L1  expression,  a  series  of  combinations  of  immunotherapy  with  histology-selected 
platinum-based chemotherapy have also shown survival benefits, which granted them EMA-approval for 
marketing. In most of such indications, it is clarified that patients with oncogene-driven tumours (e.g. 
EGFR, ALK) are directly excluded from treatment or should have failed appropriate targeted therapies 
before consideration for the given regimens: 
•  Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel for squamous histology 
•  Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + pemetrexed for non-squamous histology 
•  Atezolizumab + bevacizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
•  Atezolizumab + carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
•  Nivolumab + ipilimumab + 2 cycles of platinum-doublet, regardless of histology 
Of note, nivolumab + ipilimumab, a combination of PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitors, showed improved survival 
benefits and durable responses as 1L treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression 
>1%  (Hellman  et  al  [CheckMate-227]  2019);  nevertheless,  this  regimen  is  not  EMA-approved.  More 
recently,  the  addition  of  chemotherapy  to  the  nivolumab  +  ipilimumab  combination  showed  efficacy 
benefit over chemotherapy alone with early disease control at all PD L1 expression levels (Paz-Ares et 
al [Checkmate 9LA] 2021), receiving a positive opinion from the CHMP in September 2020. 
Unmet  medical  need:  Immunotherapy-based  treatments  are  the  1L  standard-of-care  in  patients  with 
advanced  metastatic  NSCLC  whose  tumours  do  not  harbour  driver  mutations  (NCCN  Clinical  Practice 
Guidelines in Oncology Version 2.2021). Notwithstanding these developments and the treatment options, 
the available treatment strategies extend long-term survival in only a minority of patients (Peters et al 
2019; Grant et al 2021). Overall, newer treatment options are therefore required that can explore the 
potential of immunotherapy strategies and benefit a broader patient population. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Durvalumab  is  a  monoclonal  antibody  targeting  the  programmed  cell  death  ligand  1  (PD-L1).  It  is 
approved for the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable, NSCLC in adult patients whose tumours 
express PD L1 on ≥1% of tumour cells and whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based 
chemoradiation  therapy  (EMEA/H/C/004771/0000).  Durvalumab  is  also  approved  in  combination  with 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 9/119 
 
 
  
 
 
standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy as 1L treatment of extensive stage small cell lung cancer 
(ES SCLC; EMEA/H/C/004771/II/0014/G).   
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The current type II variation for durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab and SoC chemotherapy 
for the proposed indication in metastatic NSCLC is based on efficacy data from a pivotal phase III, three-
arm,  randomised,  multi-centre,  open-label  study  in  patients  with  metastatic  NSCLC  (POSEIDON). 
POSEIDON  (D419MC00004)  was  designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  durvalumab  in 
combination with platinum-based chemotherapy with that of standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapy alone 
for the first-line treatment in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Additionally, the study was also designed 
to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  tremelimumab  in  combination  with  durvalumab  and  SoC 
chemotherapy with that of SoC in the same patient population. Additional supportive evidence of clinical 
efficacy is provided from the MYSTIC (D419AC00001) and NEPTUNE (D419AC00003) studies. 
The clinical studies included in the type II variation for durvalumab are summarised in Table 1.

Scientific  advice:  The  marketing  authorisation  holder  (MAH)  for  durvalumab  held  several  regulatory 
interactions  with  the  US  FDA  during  its  development  for  metastatic  NSCLC,  but  scientific  advice 
concerning  this  application  has  not  been  sought  from  the  CHMP.  A  presubmission  meeting  with  the 
rapporteurs was held on 03 September 2021, mostly to agree on the contents of the application package.

Paediatric requirements: On 17 March 2021, a modification of an agreed paediatric investigation plan for 
durvalumab  (EMEA-002028-PIP01-16-M02)  was  accepted  by  the  EMA,  in  accordance  with  Regulation 
(EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
GCP 
A routine GCP inspection of study D419MC00004 (POSEIDON) was adopted at the CHMP meeting held 
in January 2022. No specific concerns were known to have been identified by the assessment at the time 
of adoption of the inspection request; general triggers were used in the choice of this dossier and the 
sites involved in line with the guideline “Points to consider for assessors, inspectors and EMA inspection 
coordinators  on  the  identification  of  triggers  for  the  selection  of  applications  for  “routine”  and/or  “for 
cause” inspections, their investigation and scope of such inspections”. The purpose of the inspection was 
to verify efficacy and safety data reported in the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for a sample 
of  patients  to  be  determined  by  the  inspectors.  Moreover,  the  compliance  with  GCP  and  applicable 
regulations  was to be verified,  in  particular  where  it  had an impact on the  validity  of  the  data or  the 
ethical conduct of the study. 
This routine GCP inspection was conducted at one investigational site in Germany (21-25 February 2022), 
the main CRO in the USA (11-17 March 2022), and the sponsor in Canada (21-25 March 2022). One 
critical finding was reported during the CRO inspection; major and minor findings were observed at all 
sites.  
Although departures from GCP compliance were identified as there were one critical and several major 
findings observed during the inspections at all sites, the study was considered by the inspection team to 
have been conducted ethically and in compliance with GCP. The findings were deemed unlikely to impact 
the overall quality of the data. The inspection team concluded that the overall quality of the trial with 
the reported data had not been negatively affected, and that the data documented and reported in the 
Clinical Study Report (CSR) submitted in support of the MAA for Imfinzi could be used as basis for the 
assessment. The sponsor was however requested for a CSR addendum including a complete list of mis-
stratified  subjects  to  report  overall  survival  in  long-term  follow  up  as  part  of  the  corrective  action 
proposed for one of the major findings at the sponsor site. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Durvalumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, a protein being extensively degraded in the patient’s body 
by  regular  proteolytic  mechanisms  before  excretion.  Durvalumab  is  expected  to  biodegrade  in  the 
environment and does not pose a significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline 
on 
the 
Environmental  Risk  Assessment 
of  Medicinal 
Products 
for  Human  Use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr2), durvalumab is exempt from the submission of Environmental Risk 
Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 12/119 
 
 
  
 
 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable.  
Durvalumab  is  human  monoclonal  antibody  of  the  IgG1  kappa  subclass.  Antibodies  are  considered 
naturally occurring proteins, which are not expected to remain either stable or biologically active in the 
environment for any significant period. The justification for not performing any ERA studies is accepted. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Durvalumab population PK analysis 
The primary objectives of the durvalumab population PK analysis were to:  
• 
characterize the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab using combined data from D419MC00004, CD-ON-
MEDI4736-1108, D4191C00003, D4191C00001 and D419QC00001(referred to as POSEIDON, Study 
1108, ATLANTIC, PACIFIC and CASPIAN, respectively). 
• 
assess  the  correlation  between  predefined  categorical  and  continuous  covariates  and  individual 
Empirical Bayes Estimates (EBEs). 
• 
derive  individual  predicted  exposure  metrics  of  durvalumab  for  patients  participating  in  the 
POSEIDON study based on individual EBEs from the population PK models.   
Durvalumab population PK dataset 
The  PopPK  of  durvalumab  has  been  characterized  based  on  data  from  Studies  1108,  ATLANTIC,  and 
PACIFIC  following  monotherapy  of  durvalumab.  To  evaluate  whether  the  PK  data  of  durvalumab  in 
combination with SoC from POSEIDON are consistent with those in previous monotherapy studies, the 
existing  durvalumab  PopPK  model  was  updated  by  combining  durvalumab  PK  data  from  previous 
monotherapy studies (Study 1108, ATLANTIC, and PACIFIC), from combination with chemotherapy study 
(CASPIAN),  and  from  POSEIDON  when  administered  in  combination  with  tremelimumab  and 
chemotherapy. 
The  population  PK  analysis  was  carried  out  using  PK  samples  of  durvalumab  from  Study  1108, 
POSEIDON, ATLANTIC, PACIFIC and CASPIAN, which included 11683 serum concentration samples from 
a total of 2827 patients. No patients were excluded during model development. 21 samples (0.2%) were 
excluded from the analysis due to non-BLQ pre-dose samples or physiologically impossible ALB, CrCL or 
sPD-L1 values and another 133 samples (1.1%) with durvalumab serum concentrations below the lower 
limit of quantification (LLOQ) were also excluded from this analysis. 
Based  on  the  extended  database,  the  PK  of  durvalumab  was  well  described  using  a  2-compartment 
model with time-dependent CL. IIV was characterized on CL, V1, and Tmax, being 28%, 24%, and 25%, 
respectively. PK parameter estimates of the final durvalumab model along with percent relative standard 
error (%RSE), results of non-parametric bootstrap analysis and shrinkage can be seen in Table 3.  
The  relationships  between  the  covariates  and  the  model  parameters  are  described  in  the  following 
equations:

GOF-plots of DV vs. PRED/IPRED, CWRES vs. time since first dose, CWRES vs. PRED, WRES vs. time 
since first dose and WRES vs. PRED can be seen in Figure 1. A pcVPC of the final durvalumab model for 
POSEIDON is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: PcVPC of the Final Model vs Time per Dose – POSEIDON Study (Linear scale) 
The final model of durvalumab PK was a 2-compartment model with time-dependent CL. Residuals were 
described by a combined additive and proportional error model. IIV was included on CL, V1 and Tmax 
and  %CV  was  moderate  (28%,  24%,  and  25%,  respectively).  Structural  model  parameters  were 
estimated  with  good  precision  (RSE<10%)  and  covariate  parameters  were  estimated  with  adequate 
precision (RSE<25%). Shrinkage was low/moderate in IIV terms on CL and V1, whereas shrinkage was 
high on Tmax (56.3%), hence the information for this effect is limited. After the SCM procedure, the 
final model included the following statistically significant covariate effects on CL: WT, ALB, combination 
therapy, sex, CrCL, LDH, and ECOG; and on V1: WT and sex. Of all covariates, only ALB had an impact 
greater than 20% at the 5th percentile on CL and only WT had a greater impact than 20% at the 95th 
percentile on V1. The effect of body weight was allometrically scaled with estimated exponents of 0.337 
and  0.494  for  CL  and  V1,  respectively,  indicating  that  the  effect  of  body  weight  was  less  than 
proportional, which is generally common for mAbs.  
The  final  model  was  evaluated  by  means  of  non-parametric  bootstrap  analysis  (n=500),  RSEs,  GOF-
plots and VPCs. The number of replicates in the bootstrap analysis was initially planned to be 1000 but 
was  reduced  to  500  due  to  extensive  run  times.  No  major  model  misspecifications  were  indicated  by 
GOF-plots. The bootstrap 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles did not contain the null. 38 bootstrap runs were not 
minimizing, which yields a bootstrap convergence rate of 92.4% (462/500). Bootstrap 95% CIs of Tmax 
are notably wide.  
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 19/119 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The pcVPC of durvalumab concentration vs. time indicated that the predicted data was consistent with 
the observed percentiles in POSEIDON. In the first 20 days, slight model under-predictions in the 10th 
and  90th  percentiles  were  noted  in  POSEIDON.  Overall,  the  pcVPCs  also  showed  good  agreement 
between  the model prediction  and the observed durvalumab serum  concentrations for  each dose and 
each study. However, simulated percentile CI bands are overlapping heavily in 3 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg and 
20 mg/kg dosing regimens and CI bands are also overlapping in the pcVPC of the CASPIAN study. 
The  model  evaluation  based  on  the  GOF  shows  adequate  performance  in  the  vast  majority  of  the 
observations with a slight individual misspecification at the lower range of observations, possibly due to 
the lack of inclusion BLQ methods (M1 method), which can slightly underpredict the elimination process. 
However, this issue is considered of minor relevance. 
The clinical relevance study suggested a roughtly clinical relevant changes of AUCss due to sex (20.1%), 
durva+chemo (19.7%) and low ALB (-17.2%) and on Cmax due to low body weight (17.9%) and sex 
(18.6%) which are very close to the clinical relevance of 20%.  
No information was provided regarding observed AUCss, Cminss and Cmaxss in the study population. 
(Sparse  PK  data  in  POSEIDON  study).  The  exposure  comparison  across  the  different  dose  regimens 
proposed suggested minor impact in terms of AUC. 
QTcF modelling analysis 
Linear mixed-effects exposure-response modelling with an intercept was conducted to characterize the 
relationship  of  change  from  baseline  of  QTcF  (ΔQTcF)  with  durvalumab  or  tremelimumab  serum 
concentrations.  The  concentration-ΔQTcF  analysis  population  consisted  of  293  observations  from  67 
patients administered durvalumab and 254 observations from 66 patients administered tremelimumab 
from  Study  06.  Unscheduled  concentration-QTcF  observations  and  non-central  ECG  records  were 
excluded from the analysis.  
For durvalumab, the slope for the relationship of ΔQTcF to durvalumab concentration was 0.0048 ms per 
μg/mL (p = 0.112), with a mean intercept of 0.082 ms (p = 0.950; 90% CI: -2.24, 2.24 ms; Table 4). 
The slope or the intercept for tremelimumab and durvalumab were significantly different from 0. The 
slope  for  the  relationship  of  ΔQTcF  to  tremelimumab  concentration  was  -0.012  ms  per  μg/mL  (p  = 
0.531), and the mean intercept was 0.581 ms (p = 0.629; 90% CI: 1.41, 2.57 ms; Table 5).

Table 5: Parameter estimates of tremelimumab PK- ΔQTcF relationship 
The  upper  bound  of  the  90%  2-sided  CI  for  ΔQTcF  was  less  than  10  ms,  and  the  highest  observed 
concentration of durvalumab and tremelimumab had a predicted mean ΔQTcF of less than 5 ms (Figure 
3 Figure 4 and Table 6).

Distribution 
Distribution studies have not been conducted for durvalumab with this application.  
Elimination 
No new studies regarding the metabolism of durvalumab metabolism have been conducted.  
No new data has been provided from POSEIDON on elimination. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In Study D4190C00006 (Study 06), an approximately dose-proportional increase in PK exposure (Cmax 
and AUC0-28) of tremelimumab was observed over the dose range of 1 to 10 mg/kg tremelimumab Q4W 
when  administered  in  combination  with  durvalumab  (Table  7).  Exposure  following  multiple  doses 
demonstrated accumulation consistent with PK parameters estimated from the first dose. The PK profile 
for tremelimumab is shown in Figure 5. 
Based  on  the  final  Population  PK  model  using  POSEIDON  data,  time-dependent  CL  was  identified  for 
tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, but not with tremelimumab monotherapy.

An  approximately  dose-proportional  increase  in  PK  exposure  (Cmax  and  AUC0-28)  of  durvalumab  was 
observed  over  the  dose  range  of  3  to  20 mg/kg  durvalumab  Q4W  or  Q2W  when  administered  in 
combination with tremelimumab Q4W (Table 8).

Special populations 
The  effect  of  intrinsic  factors  (i.e.,  race,  age,  renal  impairment,  hepatic  impairment,  sex,  and  body 
weight) on the PK of durvalumab has not been studied through specific dedicated studies.  
The  original  popPK  analysis  indicated  that  body  weight,  sex,  post-baseline  ADA,  CLCR,  ECOG/WHO 
performance status, LDH level, soluble PD L1 levels, tumour type, and ALB were statistically significant 
covariates, but no change in exposure parameters (AUC, Cmin, Cmax) was more than 30%. None were 
considered clinically relevant on key PK exposure metrics of durvalumab at steady state (AUCss, Cmax,ss, 
and Cmin,ss). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with tremelimumab or durvalumab.  
In POSEIDON, no clinically meaningful PK drug-drug interactions between tremelimumab or durvalumab 
and SoC were identified. In addition, PK of abraxane and gemcitabine were similar between SoC only, 
durvalumab + SoC, and durvalumab + tremelimumab + SoC groups, suggesting that combination with 
durvalumab and tremelimumab does not have an impact on the PK of abraxane and gemcitabine. 
Additionally,  based  on  population  PK  analysis,  concomitant  durvalumab  and  platinum-based 
chemotherapy treatment did not seem to impact the PK of tremelimumab in terms of Cmax, CL or AUC.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No in vitro permeability, in vitro metabolism, or in vitro metabolic drug-drug interaction studies that 
used human biomaterials have been performed. 
Immunogenicity 
In the D + SoC arm of POSEIDON, 6.7% (19 of 285) of evaluable patients developed treatment-
emergent ADA against durvalumab and the nAb prevalence was 1.1% (3 of 285 evaluable patients). In 
the T + D + SoC arm of the POSEIDON study, 10.1% (29 of 286) of evaluable patients developed 
treatment-emergent ADA against durvalumab and the nAb prevalence was 1.0% (3 of 286 evaluable 
patients). 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 26/119 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In the POSEIDON and CASPIAN T + D + SoC pool, 6.1% (29 of 477) of evaluable patients developed 
treatment-emergent  ADA  against  durvalumab  and  the  nAb  prevalence  was  0.8%  (4 of  477  evaluable 
patients). In the D + T pan-tumor pool, a durvalumab ADA incidence of 2.5% (35 of 1379 patients; ADA-
evaluable  population)  was  observed.  The  prevalence  of  durvalumab  ADA  was  6.2%  (86 of 
1379 patients). Durvalumab nAb were detected in 0.7% of patients (9 of 1379 patients). 
The median of maximum durvalumab ADA titer of patients with treatment-emergent ADA was low at 4 
times the minimum-required dilution across all treatment regimens and pools (with the exception of the 
durvalumab 1500 mg Q3W and tremelimumab 75 mg Q3W pan-tumor pool, with a median maximum 
titer of 8 [n = 1]). 
The prevalence and incidence of durvalumab ADA were numerically higher in patients receiving treatment 
with T + D +  SoC  in POSEIDON (14.7% and  10.1%,  respectively) when compared with the D + SoC 
group in POSEIDON (11.6% and 6.7%, respectively) and with the POSEIDON and CASPIAN T + D + SoC 
pool (10.1% and 6.1%, respectively). 
Levels of nAb remained low across all treatments (1.1% of patients receiving D + SoC in POSEIDON, 
1.0% patients receiving T + D + SoC in POSEIDON, and 0.8% of patients in the POSEIDON and 
CASPIAN T + D + SoC pool). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Durvalumab is a human IgG1k mAb that binds to programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and blocks 
the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Expression of PD-L1 can be induced by inflammatory 
signals  and  can  be  expressed  on  both  tumor  cells  and  tumor-associated  immune  cells  in  the  tumor 
microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interactions with PD-1 and CD80 
(B7.1).  By  binding  to  its  receptors  PD-L1  reduces  cytotoxic  T-cell  activity,  proliferation,  and  cytokine 
production.  Blockade  of  PD-L1/PD-1  and  PD-L1/CD80  interactions  releases  the  inhibition  of  immune 
responses, without inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
Tremelimumab  is  a  human  IgG2  mAb  directed  against  cytotoxic  T  lymphocyte-associated  antigen-4 
(CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a critical regulatory signal for T-cell expansion and activation following an immune 
response, and it serves as a natural braking mechanism that maintains T-cell homeostasis. During T-cell 
activation, T cells upregulate CTLA-4, which binds to CD80 and CD86 ligands on antigen-presenting cells, 
sending  an  inhibitory  signal  and  preventing  CD28-mediated  T-cell  co-stimulation,  thus  limiting  T-cell 
activation.  Tremelimumab  blocks  these  events,  leading  to  prolongation  and  enhancement  of  T-cell 
activation and expansion. 
Durvalumab and tremelimumab are checkpoint inhibitors with distinct yet complementary mechanisms 
of  action  with  respect  to  enhancing  the  antitumor  immune  response  triggered  by  chemotherapy. 
Tremelimumab  mediated  blockade  of  CTLA-4  functions  early  in  the  immune  response,  lowering  the 
threshold for T cell activation, allowing more T cells to be activated and increasing the diversity of the T 
cell population. This increases the probability that a T cell recognizing a tumor neoantigen can become 
activated. Durvalumab blockade of PD-L1 is expected to function mainly during the effector phase of T 
cell function, once T cells enter the tumor, where it acts to block local suppression of T-cell function by 
PD-L1, enhancing the ability of activated anti-tumor T cells to target and kill tumor cells.

Primary pharmacology 
In  Study  06,  Study  10  and  Study  22,  circulating  lymphocytes  (T,  B,  and  NK  cells)  and  proliferating 
(Ki67+) T cell subsets were quantified using validated flow cytometry-based assays. 
The data for Study 06 and Study 10 demonstrated  that 15 or 20 mg/kg Q4W durvalumab (combined 
with  doses  as  low  as  1  mg/kg  Q4W  of  tremelimumab)  result  in  significant  elevations  in  proliferating 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell quantities, demonstrating a pharmacodynamic effect consistent with the proposed 
mechanisms of action of both therapeutic agents. The elevations in proliferating T cell quantities were 
dose proportional to tremelimumab. 
In Study 22, significant and consistent increases in CD4+Ki67+ T cells were observed in the T300 + D, 
T, and T75 + D treatment arms and increases in CD8+Ki67+ T cells were observed in all treatment arms. 
The increases peaked on Day 15. Findings indicated a potential saturable pharmacodynamic effect on 
this  lymphocyte  population.  Among  all  monitored  lymphocyte  populations,  median  CD8+Ki67+  T  cell 
counts from patients with CR/PR were elevated at the highest levels above those of stable disease and 
PD  patients.  Pairwise  analysis  using  the  Wilcoxon  method  revealed  significant  differences  between 
median CD8+Ki67+ T cell counts in CR/PR patients vs stable disease or PD patients (p < 0.01). 
Secondary pharmacology 
Overall,  concentration-QTc-analysis  did  not  identify  a  significant  linear  relationship  between 
tremelimumab or durvalumab serum concentrations and ΔQTcF. The predicted mean ΔQTcF and upper 
90% CI at the maximum observed concentration for tremelimumab or durvalumab in the dataset were 
below  the  threshold  of  clinical  concern.  See  section  QTcF  modelling  analysis  under  section  2.3.2 
Pharmacokinetics. 
Exposure-response relationships 
The  final  PopPK  models  of  tremelimumab  and  durvalumab  were  used  to  derive  individual  predicted 
exposure metrics for the E-R analyses.  
The E-R analysis was based on patients from POSEIDON, for whom the different exposure metrics could 
be calculated (n = 322 for durvalumab + standard of care (SOC) arm and n = 326 for durvalumab + 
tremelimumab + SOC arm). Both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were explored 
by Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates and analysed by Cox proportional hazard (CPH) models based on data 
from patients receiving the durvalumab + tremelimumab + SOC. Demographic characteristics, baseline 
covariates and exposure metrics were tested using a forward-addition and backward-elimination method 
and with significant levels of p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively.  
The parameter estimates from the final OS CPH model are presented in Table 9. The result suggested 
that having non-squamous tumours and a high Cmin,Dose 5 Treme was significantly associated with longer 
OS. 
The exposure-efficacy on OS did not identify any significant exposure-efficacy relationship, although a 
trend of longer OS was observed in patients with higher durvalumab exposure.

Page 28/119 
 
 
  
 
 
Table 9: Final CPH Model for OS 
Figure 7: OS Kaplan Meier Plots Stratified by Significant Covariates 
The following covariates for PFS were statistically significant: patients having high tumour mutational 
burden (>12 mutations per megabase), high percentage of PD-L1 T cells (<25%), non-squamous tumour 
lesions and low NLR (Q1). The parameter estimates from the final PFS CPH model are presented in Table 
10. The results suggested that having non-squamous tumours, a high Cmin,Dose 5 Treme, a low NLR, less 
than 25% of PD-L1 TC or less than 12 mutations per megabase was significantly associated with longer 
PFS  (Figure  8).  The  proportional  hazard  assumption  was  supported  by  a  non-significant  relationship 
between  residuals  and  time  except  for  the  covariate  logNLR.  No  exposure-PFS  relationship  was 
established  after  durvalumab  administration,  although  the  same  trend  as  in  OS  was  observed.  The 
exposure-PFS analysis after tremelimumab administration allowed to include the predicted Cmin at dose 
5 in the cox regression analysis with additional covariates. The result suggests that higher Cmin levels 
after 5 doses of tremelimumab are associated with higher PFS.

In addition to OS and PFS, the impact of durvalumab and tremelimumab on the ORR was investigated 
using a logistic regression approach. For this analysis, ORR was dichotomized such that PR and above 
was given a value of 1 (responder), and SD or worse was given a value of 0 (non-responder). Logistic 
regression models for assessing effect of durvalumab and tremelimumab were based on 319 and 318 
patients,  respectively.  None  of  the  exposure  metrics  for  either  drug  was  found  to  be  significant.  The 
relatively large p-values (Table 11) show that none of the exposure metrics has a statistically significant 
impact (at the prespecified significance level of α = 0.001) on the probability of being a responder.

Figure 9: Relationship between the probability of being a responder (PR or CR) and AUC after first dose

ORR was analysed with linear logistic regression models. None of the effects of exposure metrics on the 
probability of being a responder were statistically significant based on the likelihood-ratio-test.   
Exposure-safety relationship 
For  variables  used  in  the  safety  analysis  (Grade  3+  AE,  Grade  3+  AESI,  AE  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation), exposure boxplots were stratified by response values, and the probability of response 
was plotted vs exposure, after binning patients according to exposure quartiles. All categorical variables 
were converted to binary responses and analysed with linear logistic regression models. The predicted 
logistic regression curve and the observed adverse event rate in relevant bins of the observed data were 
plotted for all exposure-safety analyses. Safety endpoints were graphically evaluated and results were 
confirmed  by 
logistic  regression  models  that  did  not 
identify  any  significant 
impact  of 
tremelimumab/durvalumab exposure on the incidence of the investigated AEs. 
Of the 330 patients in the T+D+SoC arm, 3 did not have durvalumab exposure metrics while 4 did not 
have  tremelimumab  exposure  metrics  hence  327  and  326  patients  were  analyzed  in  the  logistic 
regression models for durvalumab and tremelimumab respectively. 
The relationship between the probability of having Grade 3 and above treatment-related AEs and AUC 
after the first dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab is shown in Figure 10Figure 10. The relationship 
between the probability of having Grade 3 and above treatment-related AESIs and AUC after the first 
dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab is shown in Figure 11.  
Although not statistically significant, it was notable that the coefficients for the effect of durvalumab on 
probability  of  Grade  3  and  above  treatment-related  AEs  were  negative,  suggesting  a  counterintuitive 
decrease in the probability of AEs with increasing exposure. However, these effects were small and not 
statistically  significant.  In  general,  the  apparent  overlap  in  the  distribution  of  exposure  between  the 
patients that had and those that did not have AEs suggested no clear relationship between exposure and 
the probability of having AEs.

2.3.4.  Dose response studies 
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
The Progression-free survival (PFS) Kaplan-Meier curves in the  durvalumab-treated patients stratified 
by  model  predicted  exposures  at  steady  state  and  overlaid  with  patients  in  the  placebo  group  are 
presented  in  Figure  12.  Durvalumab  treatment  led  to  longer  PFS  compared  to  placebo.  Patients  with 
AUCss and Cmin,ss exposure above the median had slightly longer PFS compared to those with exposure 
below the median. 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 34/119 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Figure 12. Progression-free survival profiles stratified by durvalumab exposure categories 
In  order  to  assess  whether  the  time-varying  CL  is  a  confounding  factor  on  the  exposure  response 
relationship, the relationship between PFS and AUCss with the change in CL over time was examined. 
The results suggest that larger percent reductions in time-varying CL were associated with longer PFS; 
however,  greater  percent  reductions  in  durvalumab  CL  were  also  associated  with  higher  AUCss. 
Therefore, the trend of longer PFS with higher AUCss is attributed to the PK being confounded by the 
decreased durvalumab CL in patients benefitting from the treatment. A small trend of a longer PFS with 
higher AUCss was found.

Exposure-safety relationship 
Safety endpoints (Grade 3 or 4 drug-related AE, grade 3 or 4 drug-related AESI, AE leading to treatment 
discontinuation, and incidence of pneumonitis) were binary responses (yes/no). No exposure-response 
relationship was observed for the selected AEs based on the durvalumab-treated patients in PACIFIC. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Durvalumab and tremelimumab are checkpoint inhibitors with distinct yet complementary mechanisms 
of  action  with  respect  to  enhancing  the  antitumor  immune  response  triggered  by  chemotherapy. 
Tremelimumab  mediated  blockade  of  CTLA-4  functions  early  in  the  immune  response,  lowering  the 
threshold for T cell activation, allowing more T cells to be activated and increasing the diversity of the T 
cell population. This increases the probability that a T cell recognizing a tumor neoantigen can become 
activated. Durvalumab blockade of PD-L1 is expected to function mainly during the effector phase of T 
cell function, once T cells enter the tumor, where it acts to block local suppression of T-cell function by 
PD-L1, enhancing the ability of activated anti-tumor T cells to target and kill tumor cells. 
Durvalumab  (Imfinzi)  was  approved  in  2018  in  the  EU  for  treatment  of  adults  with  locally  advanced, 
unresectable  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC),  whose  tumors  express  PD-L1  on  ≥  1%  of  TCs  and 
whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.  
The clinical pharmacology of durvalumab as monotherapy has previously been described adequately. 
The  MAH  is  currently  seeking  marketing  approval  for  the  use  of  durvalumab  in  combination  with 
tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic 
NSCLC with no sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.  
The purpose of the present application is to update the product information for durvalumab when given 
in combination with tremelimumab. 
The Phase III study POSEIDON is the pivotal study for this application, which provided limited new PK/PD 
data. 
The durvalumab PopPK model was updated by including 11683 serum PK samples from 2827 patients. 
The model was based on a pooled dataset from 5 Studies: Study 1108, POSEIDON, ATLANTIC, PACIFIC 
and CASPIAN. A total of 154 samples (1.3%) were excluded from the analysis and the M1-method for 
handling  outlier/BLQ-data  is  considered  acceptable.  Parameter  estimates  did  not  significantly  change 
after reintroduction of excluded data. The final model of durvalumab PK was a 2-compartment model 
with time-dependent CL. Residuals were described by a combined additive and proportional error model. 
The final durvalumab PopPK model included the following statistically significant covariate effects on CL: 
body  weight,  albumin,  combination  therapy,  sex,  creatinine  clearance,  lactate  dehydrogenase,  and 
eastern cooperative oncology group; and on V1: body weight and sex. The final model was evaluated by 
means  of  non-parametric  bootstrap  analysis  (n=500),  RSEs,  GOF-plots  and  pcVPCs.  The  covariate 
analysis allowed to partially explain the relevance of the covariate effects identified. Overall, the final 
parameter  estimates,  parameter  precision  (RSE)  and  95%  confidence  intervals  from  the  bootstrap 
analysis demonstrate the statistical and adequacy of the final population model developed. The overall 
evaluation of the final population PK through the pcVPC suggests the adequacy of the current structure 
over the POSEIDON study. 
Changes on AUCss due to sex, durva+chemo and low ALB and on Cmax due to low body weight and sex 
are very close to the clinical relevance of 20%. Prediction-corrected VPCs stratified by clinical treatment, 
body weight, sex and albumin suggested that the durvalumab PopPK model adequately captures different 
subgroups  of  populations  and  no  dose  adjustments  may  be  needed  based  on  the  clinical  relevance 
analysis.  
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 36/119 
 
 
  
 
 
Linear mixed-effects exposure-response modelling with an intercept was conducted to characterize the 
relationship  of  change  from  baseline  of  QTcF  (ΔQTcF)  with  durvalumab  or  tremelimumab  serum 
concentrations. The slope or the intercept for tremelimumab and durvalumab were significantly different 
from 0. However, for both tremelimumab and durvalumab, the upper bound of the 90% CI for ΔQTcF 
was less than 10 ms, and the highest observed concentration had a predicted mean ΔQTcF of less than 
5 ms. These values were lower than the prolongation levels of concern as established in the ICH E14 
industry guidance for clinical evaluation of QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for 
non-antiarrhythmic drugs. The normality assumption was largely met and no hysteresis was apparent in 
the ΔQTcF vs. tremelimumab concentration plots. 
Both  overall  survival  (OS)  and  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  were  explored  by  Kaplan-Meier  (KM) 
estimates and analysed by Cox proportional hazard (CPH) models based on data from patients receiving 
the durvalumab + tremelimumab + SOC. Models were evaluated by graphically superimposing model-
predictions  over  the  observed  data.  The  proportional  hazard  assumption  was  supported  by  a  non-
significant relationship between residuals and time except for the covariate logNLR. 
In POSEIDON, no clinically meaningful PK drug-drug interactions between tremelimumab or durvalumab 
and SoC were identified. In addition, PK of abraxane and gemcitabine were similar between SoC only, 
durvalumab + SoC, and durvalumab + tremelimumab + SoC groups, suggesting that combination with 
durvalumab and tremelimumab does not have an impact on the PK of abraxane and gemcitabine. 
Additionally,  based  on  population  PK  analysis,  concomitant  durvalumab  and  platinum-based 
chemotherapy treatment did not seem to impact the PK of tremelimumab in terms of Cmax, CL or AUC.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab has overall been 
adequately described.

Figure 13. Study design - POSEIDON 
Dual primary endpoints were BICR-assessed PFS according to RECIST 1.1 and OS compared between 
arms 2 and 3 (D+SoC vs. SoC) from the ITT population. As key secondary endpoints, BICR-assessed 
PFS and OS comparisons were done between arms 1 and 3 (T+D+SoC vs. SoC), also in the ITT. 
Tumour scans and response assessments according to RECIST 1.1 were performed at screening (as 
baseline) with follow-ups at week 6 ±1 week from the date of randomization, at week 12 ±1 week 
from the date of randomization, and then every 8 weeks ±1 week until radiological disease 
progression. 
The applicant states that even if the study was open-label, the study team were blinded to aggregate 
treatment information, and during the programming and preparation of statistical outputs, data were 
dummy blinded prior to database lock and study unblinding. 
Crossover was not permitted as part of the study.

T=tremelimumab; D=durvalumab; SoC=standard of care chemotherapy; PD=progressive disease. 
The chosen platinum doublet was prespecified at randomisation before first study treatment and 
subsequent changes of regimen were not allowed, although switch between cisplatin and carboplatin 
were permitted. The following histology-based chemotherapy regimens were applicable to all 3 
treatment arms: 
•  Nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin (squamous and non-squamous histologies): Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 
on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle + carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 via IV infusion on Day 1 of 
each 21-day cycle for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC 
chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC chemotherapy arm). 
•  Gemcitabine + cisplatin (squamous histology only): Gemcitabine 1000 or 1250 mg/m2 via IV 
infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle + cisplatin 75 mg/m2 via IV infusion on Day 1 of 
each 21-day cycle, for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC 
chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC chemotherapy arm). 
•  Gemcitabine + carboplatin (squamous histology only): Gemcitabine 1000 or 1250 mg/m2 via IV 
infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle + carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 via IV infusion on Day 1 of 
each 21-day cycle for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC 
chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC chemotherapy arm). 
•  Pemetrexed + carboplatin (non-squamous histology only): Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and carboplatin 
AUC 5 or 6 via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + 
D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC 
chemotherapy arm); then continued pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 maintenance (i.e., Q4W for the T + D 
+ SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms.  
•  Pemetrexed + cisplatin (non-squamous histology only): Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 
mg/m2 via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + D

+ SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC chemotherapy 
arm); then continued pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 maintenance (i.e., Q4W for the T + D + SoC 
chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms.  
*Note: For patients with non-squamous histology who received pemetrexed during induction, 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy could have been given either Q3W or Q4W dependent on 
investigator decision and local standards. 
Arm 1: During chemotherapy, tremelimumab 75 mg IV Q3W + durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q3W + 
chemotherapy Q3W for 4 cycles.  A fifth dose of tremelimumab 75 mg was to be given at Week 16 
alongside durvalumab Dose 6.  Post chemotherapy, durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q4W. 
Arm 2: During chemotherapy, durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q3W and chemotherapy Q3W for 4 cycles.  
Post chemotherapy, durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q4W. 
Arm 3: Chemotherapy Q3W alone for 4 cycles (any of the abovementioned 5 regimens).  Patients 
could receive additional 2 cycles (a total of 6 cycles post-randomization), as clinically indicated, at 
Investigator’s discretion. 
The study design did not allow cross over among treatment arms.  
Duration of treatment: Patients were treated until clinical progression or radiological progression 
unless there was unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion was 
met. 
Reductions and delays: Dose reductions of durvalumab and tremelimumab were not permitted. SoC-
related toxicity management and dose adjustment, including dose reductions and delays, should be 
performed as indicated in the local prescribing information for the relevant agent. In the event that an 
AE could reasonably be attributed to SoC, dose adjustment of SoC was attempted before modifying the 
administration of durvalumab ± tremelimumab. In the event that SoC was delayed, durvalumab ± 
tremelimumab was also delayed. 
Switch of platinum agent: In the event of unfavourable tolerability, patients could switch between 
cisplatin and carboplatin therapy at any point on study (assuming eligibility for the switched therapy is 
met).   
Treatment beyond progression: Patients in arms 1 and 2 with objective radiological progression who, 
in the investigator’s opinion, continued to receive benefit from their assigned treatment and who met 
the criteria for treatment in the setting of (PD) could continue to receive durvalumab monotherapy for 
as long as they were gaining clinical benefit.  
Retreatment: Patients in Treatment Arm 1 (T + D + SoC chemotherapy) with radiological progression 
who, in the investigator’s opinion, continued to receive benefit from their assigned treatment and who 
met the criteria for retreatment in the setting of PD, could have retreatment with durvalumab + 
tremelimumab combination therapy (only once). 
*Note: For patients randomized to Treatment Arm 3, treatment beyond progression and retreatment 
was not permitted.

Sample size 
The study will enrol approximately 2000 patients to randomize approximately 1000 patients in a 1:1:1 
ratio to durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy, durvalumab 
monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy, or SoC chemotherapy alone (approximately 333 patients in each 
treatment arm), including at least 250 patients in each treatment arm with PD-L1 TC <50%. 
The study is sized for dual primary endpoints to characterize the PFS and OS benefits of durvalumab 
monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC chemotherapy alone in the intent-to- treat (ITT) 
population. 
Dual Primary Endpoints: 
Durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC chemotherapy alone (PFS in ITT 
population): Assuming the true PFS HR is 0.67 and the median PFS in SoC chemotherapy alone arm 
is 6 months, 497 PFS events from the global cohort (75% maturity) will provide greater than 90% 
power to demonstrate statistical significance at the 2-sided alpha level of 0.9% (with overall alpha for 
PFS 1%), allowing for 1 interim analysis conducted at approximately 80% of the target events. The 
smallest treatment difference that is statistically significant will be an HR of 0.79. Assuming a 
recruitment period of 16 months, this analysis is anticipated to be 25 months from FPI. 
Durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC chemotherapy alone (OS in ITT 
population): Assuming the true OS HR is 0.7 and the median OS in SoC arm is 12.9 months, 532 OS 
events (80% maturity) will provide greater than 90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at 
the 2-sided alpha level of a 3.3% (with overall alpha for OS 4%), allowing for 3 interim analyses 
conducted at approximately 45%, 61% and 84% of the target events. The smallest treatment 
difference that is statistically significant will be an HR of 0.83. Assuming a recruitment period of 16 
months, this analysis is anticipated to be 46 months from FPI. 
Key secondary Endpoints: 
Durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC 
chemotherapy alone (PFS in ITT population): Assuming the true PFS HR is 0.51 and the median 
PFS in SoC chemotherapy alone arm is 6 months, 465 PFS events from the global cohort (70% 
maturity) will provide greater than 90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at the 2-sided 
alpha level of 0.9% (with overall alpha for PFS 1%), allowing for 1 interim analysis conducted at 
approximately 80% of the target events (information fraction). The smallest treatment difference that 
is statistically significant will be an HR of 0.78. Assuming a recruitment period of 16 months, this 
analysis is anticipated to be 25 months from FPI.

chemotherapy alone (OS in ITT population): Assuming the true OS HR is 0.7 and the median OS 
in SoC arm is 12.9 months, 532 OS events (80% maturity) will provide greater than 90% power to 
demonstrate statistical significance at the 2-sided alpha level of a 3.3% (with overall alpha for OS

Randomisation  
The randomization scheme was produced by a computer software program that incorporates a 
standard procedure for generating randomization numbers. One randomization list was produced for 
each of the randomization stratum. A blocked randomization was generated, and all centers used the 
same list to minimize any imbalance in the number of patients assigned to each treatment arm. 
Patients were identified to the IVRS/IWRS per country regulations. Randomization codes were assigned 
strictly sequentially, within each stratum, as patients become eligible for randomization. Patients who 
fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio 
according to the following stratification scheme: 
•  PD-L1 tumour expression status (PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumour cells [PD-L1 TC 
≥50%] versus PD-L1 TC <50%) 
•  Disease stage (Stage IVA versus Stage IVB) 
•  Histology (non-squamous versus squamous) 
Blinding (masking) 
The study is open label. A BICR of images will be performed. Results of these independent reviews will 
not be communicated to Investigators, and the management of patients will be based solely upon the 
results of the RECIST 1.1 assessment conducted by the Investigator. The BICR of all radiological scans 
will be performed to derive the ORR, PFS, DoR, BoR, and APF12 endpoints according to RECIST 1.1. 
The BICR will include assessment by RECIST 1.1. The imaging scans will be reviewed by 2 independent 
radiologists and will be adjudicated, if required, by a third independent radiologist who will choose the 
assessments of 1 of the 2 primary reviewers. 
This study will use an external Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to assess ongoing 
safety analyses as well as the interim efficacy analysis. 
Statistical methods 
Full analysis set 
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all randomized patients. Treatment arms were to be compared 
on the basis of randomized study treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. Patients 
who were randomized but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment were included in the 
analysis in the treatment arm to which they were randomized. 
Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints 
Progression-free survival 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 45/119 
 
 
  
 
 
The dual primary PFS analysis was to be based on the BICR tumour assessments according to RECIST 
1.1. The full analysis set will be used. The analysis used a stratified log-rank test adjusting for PD-L1 
tumour expression (PD-L1 ≥50% versus PD-L1 <50%), histology (squamous versus non-squamous), 
and disease stage (Stage IVA and Stage IVB) for generation of the p-value. The covariates in the 
statistical modelling were to be based on the values entered into interactive voice response system 
(IVRS) at randomization, even if it is subsequently discovered that these values were incorrect. 
The hazard ratio (HR) and its CI will be estimated from a stratified Cox proportional hazards model 
(with ties = Efron and PD-L1 tumour expression (PD-L1≥ 50% versus PD-L1 <50%), histology 
(squamous versus non-squamous), and disease stage (Stage IVA and Stage IVB) included in the 
STRATA statement) and the CI calculated using a profile likelihood approach. 
Key secondary PFS analysis was to be performed using the same methodology as for the dual primary 
PFS analysis described above. 
Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS were to be presented by treatment arm and PD-L1 tumour status and TMB 
subgroup, where appropriate. Summaries of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing a 
PFS event and the type of event (RECIST 1.1 or death) were to be provided along with median PFS for 
each treatment. The assumption of proportionality was to be assessed. 
Censoring rules for PFS: Subjects who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis were to 
be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 
assessment. However, if the subject progresses or dies after two or more missed visits, the subject will 
be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment prior to the two missed visits 
(Note: NE visit is not considered as missed visit). If the subject has no evaluable visits or does not 
have baseline data they will be censored at Day 1 unless they die within two visits of baseline (12 
weeks plus 1 week allowing for a late assessment within the visit window), in which case the date of 
death is used when deriving PFS. 
Sensitivity analyses: The following sensitivity analyses will be performed for the treatment 
comparisons of the dual primary and key secondary endpoints based on the FAS: 
•  A sensitivity analysis will be performed to assess possible evaluation-time bias that may be 
introduced if scans are not performed at the protocol-scheduled time points. The midpoint between 
the time of progression and the previous evaluable RECIST assessment (using the final date of the 
assessment) will be analysed using a stratified log-rank test.  
•  Attrition bias will be assessed by repeating the dual primary/key secondary PFS analysis except that 
the actual PFS event times, rather than the censored times, of subjects who progressed or died in 
the absence of progression immediately following two or more non-evaluable tumour assessments 
will be included. In addition, and within the same sensitivity analysis, subjects who take subsequent 
therapy (note that for this analysis radiotherapy is not considered a subsequent anticancer therapy) 
prior to their last evaluable RECIST assessment or progression or death will be censored at their 
last evaluable assessment prior to taking the subsequent therapy. 
•  Ascertainment bias will be assessed by analysing the site investigator data. The stratified log-rank 
test will be repeated on the programmatically derived PFS using the site investigator data. 
•  An additional sensitivity analysis will be performed with the covariates used in the statistical model 
derived from eCRF data rather than using the values from IVRS. 
Consistency of treatment effect between subgroups: Interactions between treatment and 
stratification factors will be tested to rule out any qualitative interaction using the approach of Gail and 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 46/119 
 
 
  
 
 
Simon (Gail and Simon 1985). This test will be performed separately for the treatment comparisons of 
the dual primary and key secondary endpoints based on the FAS. 
Overall survival 
OS will be analysed using stratified log-rank tests, using the same methodology as described for the 
PFS endpoints. 
The assumption of proportionality will be assessed in the same way as for PFS. 
Censoring rules for OS: Any subject not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored 
based on the last recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive. 
Sensitivity analysis and additional supportive summaries: A three-component stratified max-
combo test will be used as a sensitivity analysis with the same stratification factors as the primary 
analysis. 
A sensitivity analysis for OS will examine the censoring patterns to rule out attrition bias with regards 
to the treatment comparisons of the dual primary and key secondary endpoints, achieved by a Kaplan-
Meier plot of time to censoring where the censoring indicator of OS is reversed. 
A sensitivity analysis may be conducted to assess for the potential impact of COVID-19 deaths on OS. 
Exploratory analyses of OS adjusting for the impact of subsequent immunotherapy or other 
investigational treatment may be performed if a sufficient proportion of subjects switch. 
Objective response rate 
The ORR will be compared using logistic regression models adjusting for the same factors as the PFS 
endpoints. The results of the analysis will be presented in terms of an odds ratio (an odds ratio greater 
than 1 will favor the experimental arms) together with its associated profile likelihood 95% CI (e.g. 
using the option ‘LRCI’ in SAS procedure GENMOD) and p-value (based on twice the change in log-
likelihood resulting from the addition of a treatment factor to the model).  
If there are not enough responses for a meaningful analysis using logistic regression then a Fisher’s 
exact test using mid p-values will be presented. 
Interim analysis 
Interim analyses for efficacy will be performed by IDMC as described below: One interim analysis of 
PFS will be performed when approximately 80% of the target PFS events have occurred across Arms 2 
and 3. Three interim analyses of OS will be performed; the first at the time of the interim PFS analysis 
(approximately 45% of the target OS events in Arms 2 and 3), the second at the time of the primary 
PFS analysis (approximately 61% of the target OS events in Arms 2 and 3) and the third when 
approximately 84% of the target OS events have occurred in Arms 2 and 3. The interim analyses will 
be performed for the analyses specified in MTP. It is expected that global recruitment will have 
completed prior to the results of the interim analyses being available. 
The Lan DeMets spending function that approximates an O’Brien Fleming approach will be used to 
account for multiplicity introduced by including the one interim analysis for superiority. The boundaries 
for the treatment comparison will be derived based upon the exact number of events at the time of 
analyses. 
Multiple testing procedures for controlling the type 1 error rate 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 47/119 
 
 
  
 
 
In order to strongly control the type I error at 5% (2-sided), a multiple testing procedure (MTP) with 
gatekeeping strategy will be used across the dual primary endpoints and the secondary endpoints 
included in MTP. 
The dual primary endpoints: PFS and OS (durvalumab monotherapy +SoC chemotherapy versus SoC 
chemotherapy alone) in the ITT population (with PFS using BICR assessments per RECIST 1.1). 
The key secondary endpoints: PFS and OS (durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC 
chemotherapy and SoC chemotherapy alone) in the ITT population (with PFS using BICR assessments 
per RECIST 1.1). 
Hypotheses will be tested using a multiple testing procedure with an alpha-exhaustive recycling 
strategy (Burman et al 2009). With this approach, hypotheses will be tested in a pre-defined order as 
outlined in Figure 6. According to alpha (test mass) splitting and alpha recycling, if the higher level 
hypothesis in the MTP is rejected for superiority, the next lower level hypothesis will then be tested. 
The test mass that becomes available after each rejected hypothesis is recycled to lower level 
hypotheses not yet rejected. This testing procedure stops when the entire test mass is allocated to 
non- rejected hypotheses. Implementation of this pre-defined ordered testing procedure, including 
recycling, will strongly control type I error at 5% (2-sided), among all the dual primary endpoints and 
the secondary endpoints included in MTP.

Amendment history 
The following changes of analysis from protocol are based on CSP v4.0, dated 25-SEP-2018: 
The SAP has been formulated to indicate that the following exploratory objective may not be produced, 
for the reason that the AZ imaging expert confirmed that AZ does not currently have the capacity of 
obtaining the data using irRECIST: 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 48/119 
 
 
  
 
 
 
To explore irRECIST as an assessment methodology for clinical benefit of durvalumab + tremelimumab 
combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy and durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy 
compared with SoC chemotherapy alone with assessment by BICR has been changed to a potential. 
The analysis of expected duration of response (EDoR) was not a required analysis, so not included for 
DoR endpoints in the SAP. This is consistent with other durvalumab studies. 
The analysis of comparison of APF12 between treatment arms is removed to be consistent with other 
durvalumab studies. 
Additional changes not included in SAP version 5.0 
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis of ORR was added requiring confirmation of response no sooner than 4 
weeks after the initial CR/PR was conducted. 
Symptom improvement rate was analysed using logistic regression, using Proc Logistic instead of Proc 
Genmod. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 1807 patients were screened into the POSEIDON study: of these, 1013 patients were 
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of the study arms (T + D + SoC, D + SoC or SoC alone arms) at 
142 study centres across 18 countries in North and Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Africa. 
Patient disposition is summarised in the following figure.

Figure 15. Patient disposition - POSEIDON 
Note: The category “condition worsened” corresponds to “disease progression”. 
A total of 760 patients failed screening. The majority of them did so because of eligibility criteria, 
particularly concerning EGFR/ALK status (36% of all screen failures), missing PD-L1 status (19%), or 
investigator judgement (8%).

The proportions of patients who discontinued any study treatment on account of adverse events are 
nearly identical in the experimental T+D+SoC and D+SoC arms (23% in each) and nearly double the 
proportion of discontinuations from the control SoC arm (13%).

Outcomes and estimation 
The CSR reported the final analysis for the study, based on the DCO dates of 24-JUL-2019 (RECIST-
related endpoints) and 12-MAR-2021 (all other data). 
At the time of the PFS analysis DCO date (24-JUL-2019), the PFS data had reached 75.7% maturity 
(511 PFS events from 675 patients in the D + SoC and SoC alone arms). 
At the time of the OS analysis DCO (12-MAR-2021), the OS data had reached 81.3% maturity (549 OS 
events from 675 patients in the D + SoC and SoC alone arms). 
Outcomes of the multiple testing procedure (MTP) - POSEIDON: 
The primary OS endpoint (D+SoC vs SoC) in study POSEIDON did not meet statistical significance. 
However, the other primary PFS endpoint that compared the same arms showed statistical superiority 
and thus alpha was propagated to the next testing level, in which OS and PFS were evaluated as key 
secondary endpoints in the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms.

An odds ratio >1 favors T + D + SoC compared to SoC chemotherapy alone. 
Response does not require confirmation. 
In practice, considering '5 weeks' as threshold to allow for the 1-week permitted time-window. 
DoR is the time from the first documentation of complete response or partial response until the date of progression, death in 
absence of progression, or the last evaluable RECIST assessment for patients who progress or die after 2 or more missed 
visits. 
Calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique.

The analysis was performed using logistic regression adjusting for PD-L1 (PD-L1 ≥50% vs PD-L1 <50%), histology (squamous vs 
non-squamous), and disease stage (Stage IVA vs Stage IVB), with the CI calculated using a profile likelihood approach and the p-
value calculated based on twice the change in log-likelihood resulting from the addition of a treatment factor to the model. 
There was 1 patient who died 1 day prior to randomization and was censored at Day 1.

Progression is determined by BICR assessment, RECIST 1.1. 
Patients who have not progressed or died, or who progress or die after 2 or more missed visits, are censored at the latest evaluable RECIST 
assessment or at Day 1 if there are no evaluable visits or no baseline data and patient did not die within 2 visits of baseline. 
The midpoint between the time of progression and the previous evaluable RECIST assessment (using the final date of the assessment) is analyzed. 
Patients who have not progressed or died will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 
assessment, or at Day 1 if there are no evaluable visits. In addition, patients initiating subsequent therapy prior to their last evaluable RECIST 
assessment, progression or death in absence of progression, will be censored at their last evaluable assessment prior to starting subsequent 
therapy. 
Progression is determined by site investigator assessment, RECIST 1.1. 
Covariates used in the statistical model are derived from eCRF data rather than using the values from IVRS.

As explained in the inclusion criteria of pivotal study POSEIDON, the collection of archival/residual 
diagnostic tumour tissue was mandatory, for potential analysis of various markers by IHC or other 
methods. 
One of the exploratory objectives of the trial was to measure PD-L1 expression via the Ventana SP263 
PD-L1 IHC assay and/or TMB to fully investigate the relationship between a patient’s PD-L1 and/or 
TMB and efficacy outcomes with durvalumab, tremelimumab, and SoC regimens.  
Data concerning PD-L1 expression were presented in the ancillary analyses section. Data concerning 
TMB expression and efficacy are not considered clinically relevant and are not presented in this report.

Study NEPTUNE 
NEPTUNE was a Phase III, randomized, open-label study to determine the efficacy and safety of 
durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy versus platinum-based SoC chemotherapy in the 
first-line treatment of patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Crossover 
from SoC to durvalumab monotherapy or durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy was not 
permitted. The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the OS benefits of durvalumab + 
tremelimumab vs. SoC used as 1L treatment. During the course of the study and based on the 
emerging results from MYSTIC study, the primary endpoint for NEPTUNE was amended after 
completion of enrolment to prospectively investigate OS in bTMB ≥20 mut/Mb population (results in 
Table 47). A schematic diagram of the overall study design is shown in Figure 30.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The current application is based on efficacy data from POSEIDON, a pivotal phase III, three-arm, 
randomised, multi-centre, open-label study which compared durvalumab + chemotherapy (D+SoC, 
Arm 2) and tremelimumab + durvalumab + chemotherapy (T+D+SoC, Arm 1) to standard-of-care 
histology-specific platinum-based chemotherapy (SoC, Arm 3). 
A total of 1013 patients were randomised between June 2017 and September 2018. The dual primary 
endpoints of BICR-PFS and OS were analysed in the ITT of the D+SoC vs. SoC arms, while identical 
secondary endpoints were evaluated in the ITT of the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Scientific advice has not been sought from the CHMP.  
Experimental and control arms: The overall design of POSEIDON resembles that of other recent 
landmark trials in the treatment-naïve setting of metastatic driver-negative NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 
expression, with platinum-based chemotherapy as control arm. Currently, multiple regiments for these 
patients are approved and recommendable across Europe, most of them containing one or more 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., pembrolizumab or atezolizumab or nivolumab + ipilimumab) added 
to histology-selected platinum doublets. Even when this implies that platinum-based chemotherapy by 
itself has been long outdated as standard of care in this setting, it was still an appropriate choice of 
treatment at the time of design and conduct of POSEIDON.  
The fact that crossover was not allowed to avoid confounding OS is understood. Noting that a 
significant number of patients from the control arm would likely receive immune checkpoint inhibitors 
at progression, an exploratory PFS2 analysis was planned. 
There were 36 (10.9%) patients in the T+D+SoC arm and 33 (9.9%) in the D+SoC arm that continued 
treatment with durvalumab after confirmed disease progression. Of these, 18 (5.5%) and 20 (6.0%), 
respectively, received treatment more than 56 days post-progression. Overall, median duration of 
treatment post-progression was of 8.4 weeks in the T+D+SoC arm and 12.3 weeks in the D+SoC arm.  
Considering the relatively low number of patients that received treatment beyond progression and that 
many of them received less than 8 weeks of treatment after progression (which corresponds to the 
imaging visits interval) it is not expected this may have impacted the results.  
Induction vs. maintenance effect: In both experimental arms (D+SoC and T+D+SoC), after induction 
chemotherapy + durvalumab +/- tremelimumab, durvalumab was to be maintained Q4W until 
progressive disease. Although such design does not allow to disentangle effect magnitude of induction 
vs. maintenance immune checkpoint inhibition, this does not constitute an impediment to evaluate the 
B/R profile of the add-on products in this palliative setting.   
Study participants: Inclusion/exclusion criteria in the POSEIDON trial did not suffer any major 
amendments along study conduct and appropriately reflect the target population as in the proposed 
therapeutic indication. Although the inclusion criteria declare that staging is to be determined per the 
IASLC staging manual in thoracic oncology 2016 by Rami-Porta et al, such parameters correspond to 
the AJCC 8th edition by Amin et al. The requirements for inclusion of patients with brain metastases 
are appropriate and in line with similar trials. PD-L1 testing by the SP263 IHC assay was centralised 
during the screening phase and before randomisation, which is endorsed. 
Objectives/endpoints: The current application for durvalumab is based in efficacy results from the 
secondary objectives of this study. An improvement in survival is considered the most compelling 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 78/119 
 
 
  
 
 
outcome of a pivotal trial in Oncology, especially when supported by a reciprocal prolongation of PFS. 
The definitions for OS and RECIST 1.1-based BICR-PFS according to the protocol and SAP are 
appropriate. The definitions for the other secondary endpoints of ORR, DoR, PFS2 and PROs are also 
endorsed. 
Statistical methods: The planned sample size for the study was approximately 1000 patients. The 
study was primarily powered for showing a statistically significant improvement for durvalumab 
monotherapy compared to SoC in either OS or PFS or both. Sample size calculations are adequate. The 
stratification factors [PD-L1 tumour expression status (<50%; ≥50%), stage (IVA vs IVB) and 
histology (non-squamous vs squamous)] are clinically relevant and thus appropriate in this disease 
context. Censoring rules for PFS and OS are acceptable. The planned sensitivity and supplementary 
analyses to assess robustness of PFS and OS results are adequate, no additional analyses have been 
requested. Concerning interim analyses (one for PFS at approximately 80% of targeted events and 
three for OS at approximately 45%, 61% and 84%), an alpha spending function was used to account 
for multiplicity due to multiple looks, which is acceptable. Regarding the hierarchical testing procedure, 
if at least OS or PFS of D+SoC vs. SoC were statistically significant, the corresponding alpha portion 
was transferred to the T+D+SoC vs. SoC comparison. This strategy controls the type I error. 
Participant flow and recruitment: 1807 patients were screened for eligibility. The screen failure rate 
(42%) is higher than expected, but understandable in view of stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria: the 
majority of patients failed screening because of EGFR/ALK status, missing PD-L1 status or investigator 
judgement. The proportion of patients who did not receive the assigned treatment across all three 
arms of POSEIDON is minimal and follows the characteristic attrition pattern in open-label trials: 
slightly more patients withdrew consent in the control arm. Recruitment of the whole study took 
approximately 1 year and 3 months. Median duration of follow-up of ~1 year in the ITT is considered 
borderline for assessment of B/R in the given clinical setting. 
Conduct of the study: Important protocol deviations occurred in a small proportion of patients and are 
overall balanced among arms. A major amendment modified the dual primary endpoints as of protocol 
V 4.0 (25-SEP-2018), when all patients had already been recruited (last patient randomised 19-SEP-
2018) and before the first interim analysis of PFS/OS on 07-JAN-2019. OS for the comparison of 
D+SoC vs. SoC was upgraded, while PFS of T+D+SoC vs. SoC was downgraded, establishing the 
comparisons of D+SoC vs. SoC in the first level (primary endpoints), while relegating the comparisons 
of T+D+SoC vs. SoC to secondary endpoints. According to the applicant, this change was justified on 
emerging external data from other immunotherapy trials. Since the statistical integrity of the trial 
could have been compromised due to changes in SAP, analyses according to original test hierarchy and 
study populations (first 804 patients randomised) were requested, which obtained successful results 
for PFS and OS testing of T+D+SoC vs. SoC.  
Baseline data: The demographic characteristics of patients were relatively balanced among all three 
arms of treatment and correspond to what is expected within the clinical setting of advanced driver-
negative NSCLC: median age was 64 years (27 to 87 years); 76% were male; 56% white, 35% Asian, 
2% black; current/past smokers 78%; 33% had ECOG PS 0. Disease characteristics were also 
balanced among arms: 50% had stage IVA and 50% IVB; 63% had non-squamous tumours and 37% 
squamous; brain/CNS metastases were present in 10.5% of patients; presence of KRAS mutations was 
evaluated in ~15% (149/1013) of the ITT, and documented in 21% (31/149) of those tested. The 
distribution of patients according to tumour PD-L1 status across diverse thresholds (</≥50%, 
</≥25%, </≥1%) was balanced among all three arms of treatment and represents the global pattern 
of PD-L1 expression in advanced NSCLC.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary OS endpoint (D+SoC vs SoC) in study POSEIDON did not meet statistical significance. 
However, the other primary PFS endpoint that compared the same arms showed statistical superiority 
and thus alpha was propagated to the next testing level, in which OS and PFS were evaluated as key 
secondary endpoints in the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms. 
OS: At data cutoff 12-MAR-2021 and with a median survival follow-up of 12.5 months, 800 deaths had 
occurred (79% of OS maturity) in the ITT population of study POSEIDON. Treatment with T+D+SoC 
showed a statistically significant survival benefit as compared with SoC: HR for OS was 0.77 (95% CI 
0.65, 0.92), p-value 0.00304. K-M estimates of median OS were 14.0 months in the T+D+SoC arm 
and 11.7 months in the SoC arm. Survival performance of the chemotherapy-only control arm in 
POSEIDON is comparable to other pivotal trials in a similar PD-L1 all-comer setting of metastatic 
NSCLC: range of 10.6 in KEYNOTE-189 to 13.9 months in IMpower130. The K-M curves of T+D+SoC 
vs. SoC separate as of the 10th month, noting a delayed treatment effect from added anti-CTLA-4/PD-
L1 therapy. Important censoring occurs as of the 30th month of follow-up, but landmark analysis at 24 
months (OS24) shows a considerably higher proportion of patients alive in the T+D+SoC (33%) as 
compared to the SoC (22%) arm. 
Acknowledging differences in study design –particularly selection of squamous (SQ) or non-squamous 
(NSQ) histologies, or allowing both– and limitations from cross-trial comparisons, it is to note that 
longer median survival was observed in akin studies in which only anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents were added 
to backbone platinum-based chemotherapy in the experimental arm: 22.0 months in the chemo + 
pembrolizumab arm in metastatic NSQ NSCLC (KEYNOTE-189; Rodríguez-Abreu et al, JCO 2020); 
21.9 months in the chemo + cemiplimab arm in advanced SQ/NSQ NSCLC (EMPOWER-Lung3; 
Gogishvili et al, ESMO 2021); 19.5 months in the chemo + atezolizumab arm in metastatic SQ/NSQ 
NSCLC (IMpower150, Tecentriq SmPC); 18.6 months in the chemo + atezolizumab arm in metastatic 
NSQ NSCLC (IMpower130; Cappuzzo et al, Ann Onc 2018); 17.1 months in the chemo + 
pembrolizumab arm in metastatic SQ NSCLC (KEYNOTE-407; Paz-Ares et al, JTO 2020). Interestingly, 
however, the addition of both anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 agents to backbone platinum-based 
chemotherapy produced almost identical median OS results as those observed in POSEIDON: 14.1 
months in the histology-based chemotherapy + nivolumab + ipilimumab arm in patients with 
metastatic SQ/NSQ NSCLC (CheckMate 9LA; Paz-Ares et al, Lancet Oncol 2021). 
BICR-PFS: At data cutoff 24-JUL-2019, 749 PFS events (74% maturity) had occurred across the three 
arms of POSEIDON. K-M estimated median PFS was numerically higher in the T+D+SoC arm (6.2 
months) as compared with the SoC arm (4.8 months), while HR for PFS outlines the statistical 
advantage from T+D+SoC vs. SoC: 0.72 (95% CI 0.60, 0.86), p-value 0.00031. The K-M curves 
separate as of the second month and remain separated, highlighting the PFS advantage of T+D+SoC. 
Overall, PFS results from the experimental (both T+D+SoC and D+SoC arms) and control arms of 
POSEIDON are comparable to those from other pivotal trials in the same setting. Results of PFS by 
investigator are overall comparable to BICR assessment and the HR for INV-PFS is consistent with that 
of BICR-PFS, discrepant declarations of the RECIST event occurred in a reasonably low number of 
instances. 
BICR-ORR/DoR: Rather than using the ITT, the calculations of ORR were done using patients with 
measurable disease as the denominator. This is acceptable in a phase III trial since OS and PFS are 
prioritised in hierarchical testing. Both confirmed and unconfirmed responses (almost all of them 
partial) were numerically higher in the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the control SoC arm. However, 
the proportion of responders (unconfirmed responses) was nearly identical between both experimental 
arms: 46.3% in T+D+SoC vs. 48.5% in D+SoC. Responses (unconfirmed responses) were more 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 80/119 
 
 
  
 
 
durable in the T+D+SoC arm (median DoR 7.4 months) as compared to the SoC arm (4.2 months), 
supporting the delayed treatment effect hypothesis portrayed in the OS analysis. 
Subsequent treatment/PFS2: A notably higher proportion of patients received subsequent treatments 
in the SoC arm (60%) as compared to either of the experimental arms (41% in T+D+SoC, 44% in 
D+SoC). As expected, the proportion of second-line immunotherapy was higher in the 
immunotherapy-naïve SoC arm (49%, 95 out of 193) as compared to both T+D+SoC (9%, 11/121) 
and D+SoC (9%, 12/137). Across the three arms of POSEIDON, 66% (435/658) of the PFS2 events 
were deaths in the absence of second progression. Albeit the median time to second progression or 
death (PFS2) was comparable among all three arms (10.2 months in T+D+SoC, 10.0 in D+SoC and 
9.1 in SoC), HR for PFS2 (0.72) suggests sustained benefit from T+D+SoC vs. SoC.  
Ancillary analyses: OS and PFS benefits from T+D+SoC vs. SoC seem to be maintained across most of 
the prespecified subgroups. However, in elderly patients (≥75 years of age) a HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 
0.64, 1.71) for OS was reported for T+D+SoC (n=35) vs. SoC (n=40). Due to the exploratory nature 
of this subgroup analysis no definitive conclusions can be drawn. This said, considering that an overall 
worse safety profile was observed in this subgroup of patients, a warning was included in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC stating that in elderly the combination therapy should be used with caution after careful 
consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. Exploratory efficacy and safety results 
in this subgroup are outlined in sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, respectively. 
Importantly, the efficacious advantage –in terms of OS, PFS and ORR– of T+D+SoC vs. SoC is 
maintained regardless of PD-L1 expression status, i.e., above and below diverse PD-L1 cut-offs. Of 
note, a similar outcome regarding PD-L1 subgroups was observed in the CheckMate-9LA trial, when 
the nivolumab + ipilimumab + chemotherapy arm was compared against the chemotherapy arm in an 
akin population of advanced NSCLC (p. 99/157, EPAR EMEA/H/C/WS1783). 
The sensitivity analyses of OS and PFS are consistent with the primary analysis of both variables. 
Exploratory analysis of T+D+SoC vs. D+SoC: The survival K-M curves of the experimental arms 
remain close along the first year of follow-up, and subsequently show a wider separation, suggesting 
the benefit from added tremelimumab is established in the long term. This hypothesis is reinforced 
when looking at the duration of response data, as the K-M curves between T+D+SoC and D+SoC 
exhibit wider separation than those from OS or PFS. Importantly, OS subgroup analyses in the PD-L1 
<1% population –about one third of the ITT– suggest the magnitude of survival benefit from T+D+SoC 
is particularly higher in this subgroup, as compared to that seen in across the other PD-L1 cut-offs, 
while the contribution of tremelimumab appears to be less clear as PD-L1 expression increases. 
However, these comparisons portray an exploratory nature –they were not statistically powered– and 
thus no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
Supportive data from MYSTIC and NEPTUNE: Including POSEIDON, all three trials were open-label, 
randomised, had a similar metastatic NSCLC targeted population, and dual primary endpoints of OS 
and PFS. The essential difference was that MYSTIC and NEPTUNE did now allow a platinum-based 
backbone chemotherapy in the experimental arms, while POSEIDON did. The overall efficacy outcome 
of MYSTIC and NEPTUNE –none met their primary endpoints– was not different from other trials in 
which anti-PD-L1 monotherapy failed to show benefits for the ITT population, suggesting that the 
subgroup of patients who drive the beneficial trend for ICI-monotherapy were high-PD-L1 expressors 
(usually defined as PD-L1≥50%). Whether OS and PFS data from the ITT of either trial are supportive 
of efficacy benefits from adding tremelimumab to D+SoC is debatable, but in any case, it can be 
inferred that a detrimental OS/PFS effect is not evident.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Although the primary OS endpoint for the comparison of durvalumab + chemotherapy vs. 
chemotherapy was not met in study POSEIDON, the favourable PFS comparison of these arms allowed 
testing of the secondary endpoints of OS and PFS in the tremelimumab + durvalumab + chemotherapy 
(T+D+SoC) vs. chemotherapy (SoC) arms. In the targeted population of patients with metastatic 
EGFR/ALK-negative NSCLC regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression, OS and PFS from treatment with 
T+D+SoC were statistically superior to SoC chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints of ORR, DoR and 
PFS2 endorsed such benefits, as did subgroup and sensitivity analyses.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The pivotal study to support this indication is POSEIDON, a phase III, randomised, multicentre, three-
arm, open-label study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of durvalumab in combination with 
platinum-based chemotherapy (D+SoC) with that of SoC alone chemotherapy (SoC) for the first‑line 
treatment in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Additionally, the study also planned to compare the 
efficacy and safety of tremelimumab, durvalumab and SoC chemotherapy combination (T+D+SoC) 
with that of SoC chemotherapy in the same patient population. 
Safety dataset: The safety analysis set (SAS) of POSEIDON included all patients who received at least 
1 dose of study treatment and comprised 997 patients: T + D + SoC (n = 330); D + SoC (n = 334); 
and SoC chemotherapy (n = 333). Of note, 1 patient who was randomized to the T + D + SoC arm 
and 1 patient who was randomized to the D + SoC arm only received SoC chemotherapy (see protocol 
deviations) and were included in the SoC chemotherapy arm of the safety analysis set. 
For further support in the evaluation of the safety profile of durvalumab, the applicant provided data 
from a safety pool (“T + D pan-tumour pool”) that included 2280 patients from 9 studies, who had 
received at least one dose of durvalumab at 1500 mg Q4W, 20 mg/kg Q4W or 10 mg/kg Q2W, in 
combination with tremelimumab at 75 mg Q4W or 1 mg/kg Q4W for any line of therapy across tumour 
types (Table 48). The main advantage of including the results from the T+D pan-tumour pool in the 
safety assessment report is to be able to elucidate the contribution of immunotherapy components to 
the combination safety profile as in the included studies patients only received T+D.

AEs: The integrated analysis of adverse events (AEs) for the safety pools was based on all 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as defined in each individual study. MedDRA v23.1 was 
used for coding of AE data. Data from studies originally reported in previous versions of MedDRA were 
upversioned to MedDRA v23.1 for the integrated safety database. 
AESIs: Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are defined as AEs with potential inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism that may require frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapies include standard 
endocrine supplementation, as well as treatment of symptoms resulting from endocrine disorders (eg. 
therapies for hyperthyroidism include beta blockers [eg. propranolol], calcium channel blockers [eg. 
verapamil, diltiazem], methimazole, propylthiouracil, and sodium perchlorate). 
imAEs: Immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs) are AESIs (excluding infusion 
related/hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction) consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism that 
require treatment with systemic corticosteroids, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressants, or endocrine 
therapy.  
The AESI categories include dermatitis/rash, pneumonitis, diarrhoea/colitis, endocrinopathies (adrenal 
insufficiency, hyperthyroid events, hypothyroid events, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and Type I diabetes 
mellitus), hepatic events, intestinal perforations, myocarditis, myositis, renal events, pancreatic 
events, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and other rare/miscellaneous events. Infusion 
related reactions and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions are AESIs; however, these are not 
assessed for imAE designation because they are common to mAb drugs in general and occur due to a 
mechanism of action different from that for imAEs. 
Adjudication of imAEs: A suspected immune-mediated adverse event (imAE) was identified as AESI 
treated with systemic steroids, other immunosuppressants, and/or endocrine therapy, except 
pneumonitis AESIs, which are all suspected imAE. All suspected imAEs underwent medical review, 
which was performed in a blinded manner.  
A confirmed imAE is a suspected imAE that, after medical review, is deemed consistent with an 
immune-mediated mechanism of action, and where there is no clear alternative etiology. The process 
for adjudicating imAEs starting from the study level AE reporting dataset through to confirmed imAE

- immune-mediated hypothyroidism occurred in 209 (9.2%) patients, including Grade 3 in 6 (0.3%) 
patients. The median time to onset was 85 days (range: 1 - 624 days). Thirteen patients received 
systemic corticosteroids and 8 of the 13 received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day). Treatment discontinued in 3 patients. Resolution occurred in 52 
patients. Immune-mediated hypothyroidism was preceded by immune-mediated hyperthyroidism in 25 
patients or immune-mediated thyroiditis in 2 patients. 
- immune-mediated hyperthyroidism occurred in 62 (2.7%) patients, including Grade 3 in 5 (0.2%) 
patients. The median time to onset was 33 days (range: 4 - 176 days). Eighteen patients received

40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Fifty-three patients required other therapy (thiamazole, 
carbimazole, propylthiouracil, perchlorate, calcium channel blocker or beta-blocker), One patient 
discontinued treatment due to hyperthyroidism. Resolution occurred in 47 patients.  
- immune-mediated thyroiditis occurred in 15 (0.7%) patients, including Grade 3 in 1 (< 0.1%) 
patient. The median time to onset was 57 days (range: 22 - 141 days). Five patients received systemic 
corticosteroids and 2 of the 5 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day). Thirteen patients required other therapy including, hormone 
replacement therapy, thiamazole, carbimazole, propylthiouracil, perchlorate, calcium channel blocker, 
or beta-blocker. No patients discontinued treatment due to immune-mediated thyroiditis. Resolution 
occurred in 5 patients. 
- immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in 33 (1.4%) patients, including Grade 3 in 16 
(0.7%) patients and Grade 4 in 1 (< 0.1%) patient. The median time to onset was 105 days (range:

in the T + D + SoC arm and 5 patients (1.5%) in the SoC alone arm. The majority of the events were 
of CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 in severity with 1 patient (0.3%) in the T + D + SoC arm experiencing a CTCAE 
Grade 3 event. In the T + D + Chemo pool and the T + D pan tumour pool, AESIs of infusion related 
reaction were reported in 17 patients (2.9%) and 45 patients (2.0%), respectively. There were no 
Grade 4 or 5 events. 
In POSEIDON, AESIs of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions (grouped term) were reported in 3 
patients (0.9%) each in the T + D + SoC arm and the SoC alone arm. In the D + T + Chemo pool and 
the T + D pan-tumor pool, AESIs of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions were reported in 5 patients 
(0.8%) and 22 patients (1.0%), respectively.

Patients are counted once for each preferred term. Number (%) of patients with AEs, sorted by alphabetical order for 
preferred term. Each patient has only been represented with the maximum reported CTCAE grade at either the start of AE or 
after increasing in severity for each system organ class/preferred term. 
The boundaries for the weight quartiles are derived from the overall POSEIDON population with known baseline weight (n = 
1009) and are Q1 = 57.0 kg, Q2 = 67.2 kg and Q3 = 77.0 kg, respectively. 
Percentages calculated from number of patients in the safety analysis set in that weight group in that treatment group.

Immunological events 
POSEIDON: Of the 278 tremelimumab ADA-evaluable patients in the T + D + SoC arm, 44 (15.8%) 
tested positive for tremelimumab ADA at any visit. Of the 286 durvalumab evaluable patients in the 
same arm, 42 (14.7%) tested positive for durvalumab at any visit. The overall safety and tolerability 
profile of patients with ADAs was similar to those without ADAs. 
T + D pan-tumour pool: Of the 1337 tremelimumab ADA-evaluable patients, 171 (12.8%) tested 
positive for tremelimumab at any visit. Of the 1379 durvalumab-evaluable patients, 86 (6.2%) tested 
positive for durvalumab at any visit. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Durvalumab and tremelimumab are immunoglobulins, therefore, no formal pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interaction studies have been conducted.

Post marketing experience 
Durvalumab (IMFINZI) was first approved by the US FDA on 01 May 2017 for the treatment of patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or 
following platinum-containing chemotherapy or who have disease progression within 12 months of 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.  
IMFINZI was further approved by the US FDA on 16 February 2018 for the treatment of patients with 
unresectable Stage III NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following concurrent platinum-based 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. On 21 September 2018, IMFINZI was approved in the EU for the 
treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable NSCLC in adults whose tumors express PD-L1 
on ≥ 1% of tumor cells and whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based 
chemoradiation therapy. As of 12 July 2021, IMFINZI for the treatment of Stage III NSCLC has been 
approved in over 70 countries (including EU countries). 
IMFINZI was first approved for the first-line treatment of patients with ES-SCLC in combination with 
etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin in Singapore on 28 February 2020. On 27 March 2020, 
IMFINZI was additionally approved in the US for the indication cited above. As of 12 July 2021, 
IMFINZI has been approved in over 53 countries for ES-SCLC (including EU countries). 
In February 2021, the US supplemental BLA for IMFINZI has been voluntarily withdrawn for the locally-
advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma indication, following consultation with the FDA; however, 
this was not due to any safety concerns, new safety data and the benefit/risk profile in this setting 
remains consistent per historical evaluation of provided clinical data. 
The cumulative global post-marketing patient exposure to durvalumab (10 mg/kg) since launch to 30 
June 2021 has been estimated to be 52006 patient-years. No new safety concern was identified based 
on the post-marketing safety reports. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety results were provided for all three arms of POSEIDON (T+D+SoC, D+SoC and SoC), a 
“T+D+chemo pool” and a “T+D pan-tumour pool”. The supportive pooled data have been used to try 
to elucidate the contribution of T + D to the safety profile of the proposed combination. The size and 
content of the presented safety database are deemed sufficient for B/R assessment in the targeted 
advanced NSCLC population.  
Out of the entire pipeline of phase I, II and III trials where tremelimumab was given in monotherapy 
or in combination at multiple doses/regimens for diverse cancers, the latter was established by 
selecting 8 trials (2 in solid tumours, 4 NSCLC, 2 HNSCC) in which tremelimumab was administered at 
1 mg/kg Q4W x 4 in combination with durvalumab, and 1 single trial (HCC) in which tremelimumab 
was administered at the flat 75 mg dose. The selection of these trials and exclusion of others (e.g. 
DANUBE) has been well justified.

The “T+D+chemo pool” included the T+D+SoC chemotherapy arms of POSEIDON (NSCLC) and 
CASPIAN (ES-SCLC). There is at least another ongoing trial with a T+D+chemo arm (NILE, patients 
with advanced urothelial carcinoma), but results are not expected until 2023. 
Adjudication of imAEs in the POSEIDON study was done programmatically (following a prespecified 
algorithm, without independent review), which is acceptable. 
Exposure: According to the protocol of POSEIDON, tremelimumab as part of the T+D+SoC arm was to 
be administered for up to 5 doses (C1-4, C6). About 66% of patients in the T+D+SoC arm of 
POSEIDON received 5 or more tremelimumab doses, roughly comparable to 61% in CASPIAN. 
Durvalumab was instead to be given along induction chemotherapy (Q3W x 4 cycles), and then 
maintained Q4W until patients met any of the discontinuation criteria. Durvalumab exposure was 
appropriate overall (mean of 12 cycles in both experimental arms, more than half patients receiving 
8). Chemotherapy could be given for a maximum of 4 cycles in the experimental arms and 6 cycles in 
the control arm. Across the three arms, the majority of patients received 4 or more cycles of 
chemotherapy (80% in T+D+SoC, 82% D+SoC and 75% SoC), implying that added immunotherapy 
did not have an impact on chemotherapy exposure. The distribution of the 5 histology-specific 
chemotherapy doublets permitted in the study was balanced among the three arms and reflects global 
trends in physician’s choice for this setting. 
Overall, exposure parameters of chemotherapy, durvalumab and tremelimumab across the different 
arms of study POSEIDON are considered appropriate for the assessment of B/R. 
AEs occurred in almost all patients across the three arms of POSEIDON. While high-grade (G3/4) AEs 
occurred in about half of the patients from each arm, G5 AEs were slightly more frequent in the 
experimental arms (12% in T+D+SoC, 10% D+SoC, 9% SoC), as were SAEs (44%, 40% and 35%, 
respectively) and AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment (22%, 24% and 15%, respectively).  
25 out the 26 most frequent AEs (incidence ≥10% in any arm) exhibited numerically higher incidence 
in the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the SoC arm, while the opposite occurred only for neutrophil 
count decreased. Typical chemotherapy-related AEs (anaemia, nausea, neutropenia, decreased 
appetite and fatigue) were the five most frequent AEs across the three arms of POSEIDON, with 
slightly higher incidence in the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the SoC arm. Diarrhoea and rash, with 
potentially immune-related pathophysiology, were considerably more frequent in the T+D+SoC arm 
than in the SoC arm (22% and 19% vs. 15% and 7%, respectively). Of note, comparable incidence of 
both AEs was observed in similar arms from the Checkmate-9LA trial: 20% and 18% vs. 12% and 3% 
(EPAR WS-1783, p. 125/157), noting that patients only received two chemotherapy cycles in this trial. 
The incidence of hypothyroidism, a well-known imAE, was noticeably higher in the T+D+SoC arm 
(12%) than in the D+SoC (6%) or SoC (1%) arms. In line with these data, the incidence of this AE 
was 11% across both T+D+chemo and T+D pan-tumour pools. 
High-grade (≥G3) AEs: Since the proportions of G3/4 AEs were similar in both T+D+SoC and SoC 
arms (53% and 52%, respectively), it can be inferred that the higher incidence of G≥3 AEs in the 
T+D+SoC arm (66% vs. 61% in SoC) is driven by G5 AEs (12.4% and 9%, respectively), which is 
worrisome. Noting that G5 AEs occurred in 10.2% of the D+SoC arm, it becomes apparent that the 
addition of tremelimumab increases the risk for toxic death.  
The proportions of the most frequent G3/4 AEs were overall similar across the three arms of 
POSEIDON, highlighting events of chemotherapy-related myelotoxicity, increases in pancreatic and 
hepatic enzymes and pneumonia. Of note, high-grade imAEs were not among the most frequently 
observed events in the experimental arms. 
AESIs/imAEs:  
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 108/119 
 
 
  
 
 
AESIs included imAEs and infusion-related reactions (IRRs) or hypersensitivity/ anaphylaxis reactions.  
The proportion of patients with imAEs was 32% in the T+D+SoC arm, 17% in the D+SoC and 4% in 
the SoC arm. The distribution of G3/4 imAEs (10%, 6% and 1%, respectively), serious imAEs (9%, 5% 
and 1%) and imAEs leading to discontinuation (5%, 4% and 1%) were similar. The distribution of 
specific imAEs in the D+SoC arm is typical for PD-L1 inhibition, with predominance of hypothyroidism 
(6%), hepatotoxicity (3%), pneumonitis (3%) and dermatitis/rash (2%).  
Endocrinopathies, hepatotoxicity and rash/dermatitis are overall more manageable than other imAEs, 
have less impact in morbidity, and less likelihood for becoming serious events or worsening the overall 
outcome of a patient. Events of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been 
reported in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms 
of rash or dermatitis and managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or 
corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
On the other hand, diarrhoea/colitis and pneumonitis might present as challenges since they imply a 
symptomatic burden and often require hospitalisation. The T+D+SoC arm presented twice as many 
cases of immune-mediated diarrhoea/colitis than the D+SoC arm (14 vs. 6) and more cases of 
pneumonitis (14 vs. 9). 
Despite an unexpected proportion of pancreatic events was reported as AESIs in the T+D+SoC arm 
(any-grade 14%, G3/4 1.2%), most of these correspond to laboratorial anomalies (elevations of 
amylase and lipase, among others). 
Of note, there was one death related to multiple imAEs: pancreatitis, hepatitis, myocarditis and 
nephritis: these events took place shortly after the second treatment cycle. Patients should be 
monitored for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment with Imfinzi in 
combination with tremelimumab, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Patients should be 
monitored for abnormal renal function tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Patients should 
also be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated pancreatitis and myocarditis. Immune 
mediated hepatitis, nephritis, pancreatitis and myocarditis should be managed through dose 
interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of 
the SmPC). 
There was one death due to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in the D+SoC arm. 
Given the mechanism of action of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, other potential 
immune mediated adverse reactions may occur. The following immune-related adverse reactions have 
been observed in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab: myasthenia 
gravis, myositis, polymyositis, meningitis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune 
thrombocytopenia and cystitis noninfective. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms and 
managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or corticoisteroid treatment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
IRRs and hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions were rare across the three arms of POSEIDON, and 
nearly all were G1/2: there was only one patient who presented a G3 IRR in the T+D+SoC arm, and 
nobody presented ≥G4 events. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of IRRs. IRRs 
should be managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation, prophylaxis and appropriate 
treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
ADRs: The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions observed in patients treated with T+D+SoC 
(n=330) in the POSEIDON trial were anaemia (49.7%), nausea (41.5%), neutropenia (41.2%), fatigue 
(36.1%), rash (25.8%) thrombocytopenia (24.5%), and diarrhoea (21.5%). The most common (> 
2%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions were neutropenia (23.9%), anaemia (20.6%), pneumonia (9.4%), 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 109/119 
 
 
  
 
 
thrombocytopenia (8.2%), leukopenia (5.5%), fatigue (5.2%), lipase increased (3.9%), amylase 
increased (3.6%), febrile neutropenia (2.4%), colitis (2.1%) and aspartate aminotransferase 
increased/alanine aminotransferase increased (2.1%).  
SAEs: Pneumonia was the most frequent SAE in the trial, and its incidence in the T+D+SoC arm 
doubled that of the control arm SoC (11% vs. 5%). As expected, myelotoxic events (anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia), likely related to chemotherapy, 
were also frequent in all three arms of the trial, with comparable incidence among them. 
Noting that diarrhoea and colitis are important identified risks of anti-CTLA-4 agent ipilimumab, it is of 
no surprise that the number of patients with serious diarrhoea was higher in the T+D+SoC arm (8 
patients), as compared to the other two arms (1 each) of the pivotal trial, pointing out the potential 
pathophysiologic role of CTLA-4 block in the development of serious immune-mediated 
diarrhoea/colitis. To support this hypothesis, the incidence of this SAE was nearly identical across the 
T+D+SoC arm (2.4%), and the T+D+chemo and T+D pools (2.5% in each). Data for colitis, slightly 
less prevalent, mimics this pattern. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
colitis/diarrhoea and intestinal perforation and managed through dose interruption, treatment 
discontinuation and/or corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Serious pneumonitis, with a likely immune-mediated background –known imAE from durvalumab– 
occurred almost exclusively in the experimental arms (6 cases in T+D+SoC, 5 in D+SoC, 1 in SoC). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should 
be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and disease-related aetiologies excluded, 
and managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and corticosteroid treatment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Deaths: Regardless of causality, there were 41 AEs leading to death in the T+D+SoC arm, 34 in the 
D+SoC arm and 30 in the SoC arm. The most frequent category (system organ class) of AEs leading to 
death across all three arms of POSEIDON was infections and infestations (15, 8 and 9, respectively), 
with 7 events of fatal pneumonia in each arm (although there was another event of fatal respiratory 
tract infection in the T+D+SoC arm). Cardiac disorders followed in frequency as AEs with outcome of 
death, again with almost twice as many occurrences in the T+D+SoC arm, as compared to the other 
two arms: 8, 4 and 5, respectively. On the other hand, fatal events of pulmonary embolism occurred 
much frequently in the control arm: 1, 3 and 5, respectively.  
Laboratory findings: Shifts in haematological parameters were comparable between the T+D+SoC and 
SoC arms of the pivotal trial. Increases of ALT/AST/bilirubin were noticeably higher in the T+D+SoC 
arm across different categories. This parallels the overall higher incidence of hepatobiliary disorders 
(8.2% patients in the T+D+SoC arm vs. 3.3% in the SoC arm). Paradoxically, a potential Hy’s law 
definition was met in more patients from the SoC arm (9) as compared to the T+D+SoC arm (3). 
Incidence of AE of hypothyroidism was declared in 11.8% in the T+D+SoC arm, 6.3% in the D+SoC 
arm and 1.2% in the SoC arm (p. 190/9160 ISS), highlighting likely immune-mediated 
pathophysiology in relationship to the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The true incidence of 
subclinical –likely immune-mediated– hypothyroidism is probably higher, as the table on abnormal 
thyroid tests suggest, elevated TSH was evident in 31% of patients from the T+D+SoC arm, vs. 28 in 
the D+SoC arm, and 24% in the SoC arm. Patients should be monitored for abnormal thyroid function 
tests prior to and periodically during treatment and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Immune-
mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis should be managed through dose 
interruption, symptomatic treatment or thyroid hormone replacement as clinically indicated (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 110/119 
 
 
  
 
 
Immune mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in patients receiving Imfinzi in combination with 
tremelimumab. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. 
For symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, patients should be managed through dose interruption, 
corticoisteroid treatment and hormone replacement (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Immune mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can first present as diabetic ketoacidosis that can be 
fatal if not detected early, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab and chemotherapy. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of type 1 
diabetes mellitus. For symptomatic type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients should be managed via treatment 
with insulin as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis or hypopituitarism. For 
symptomatic hypophysitis or hypopituitarism, patients should be managed as recommended through 
dose interruption and corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Individual patient listings of ECG values have been provided. The risk of QT prolongation in relationship 
to tremelimumab appears low. 
AEs by age subgroups: In the POSEIDON study in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination 
with Imfinzi and platinum-based chemotherapy, some differences in safety were reported between 
elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients. The safety data from patients 75 years of age or older are 
limited to a total of 74 patients. There was a higher frequency of serious adverse reactions and 
discontinuation of any study treatment due to adverse reactions in 35 patients aged 75 years of age or 
older treated with Imfinzi and tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (45.7% and 28.6%, 
respectively) relative to 39 patients aged 75 years of age or older who received platinum-based 
chemotherapy only (35.9% and 20.5%, respectively). Careful consideration of the potential 
benefit/risk of this regimen on an individual basis is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC). 
Overview of AEs by subgroups of other intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics does not show a specific 
pattern of safety concerns in a subgroup of considerable size. Data on safety by weight quartiles does 
not suggest major differences except for a higher incidence of maximum CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 in the 
subgroup of patients with the lowest body weight (i.e. <57 kg). However, a particular toxicity trend for 
the occurrence of high-grade events was not observed. 
AEs by ADA status: The proportions of patients with anti-tremelimumab antibodies in the T+D+SoC 
arm and T+D pan-tumour pool were similar (16% and 13%, respectively), but those for anti-
durvalumab antibodies were higher in POSEIDON (15% and 6%, respectively). The incidence of AEs 
across the diverse categories did not differ significantly for patients defined as ADA+ or ADA- 
(durvalumab in both experimental arms and tremelimumab in arm T+D+SoC). 
AEs leading to discontinuation: The overall proportion of patients that discontinued any treatment in 
the context of an AE was higher in the experimental arms (22% in T+D+SoC, 20% in D+SoC) than in 
the control arm (15%). The main AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment across the three 
arms of POSEIDON were pneumonia, anaemia and acute kidney injury. The addition of tremelimumab 
or durvalumab does not translate into a higher rate of AEs leading to dose reduction of chemotherapy. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Regardless of causality, all AEs categories (high-grade, serious, AEs leading to death or to treatment 
discontinuation, AESIs/imAEs) occurred in a numerically higher proportion of patients from the 
T+D+SoC arm as compared to the other two arms of pivotal trial POSEIDON.

Undoubtedly, the addition of double checkpoint inhibition (PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to a backbone platinum 
doublet imposes higher overall toxicity in the targeted population, which must be considered in the 
context of frail patients, particularly those of advanced age or multiple comorbidities. Immune-
mediated events are the main concern from the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab: 
although most were manageable and did not considerably impact long-term clinical outcome (e.g. 
endocrinopathies, hepatotoxicity and rash/dermatitis), others constitute serious entities with a 
significant symptomatic burden (diarrhoea/colitis, pneumonitis), representing a considerable hazard to 
the wellbeing of patients in this palliative setting.   
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8 succession 1 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 8 succession 1 with the following content: 
Safety concerns 
There are no safety concerns. 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
There are no safety concerns, so only routine pharmacovigilance activities are required. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Not applicable as there are no safety concerns. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template version 10.2, which 
were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The  wording  in  the  PL  is  similar  to  the  text  previously  tested  during  the  IMFINZI  MAA.  IMFINZI  is 
administered as an IV infusion by a medical professional therefore that the changes are not significant 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 112/119 
 
 
  
 
 
enough to warrant an additional user consultation for this new indication. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Imfinzi  (durvalumab)  is  included  in  the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance and it is a biological product that is not 
covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 January 2011. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approved therapeutic indication is: 
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the 
first-line treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no sensitizing 
EGFR mutations or ALK positive mutations. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The first line (1L) treatment of metastatic NSCLC has evolved from cytotoxic chemotherapies based on 
physician’s preference to a hallmark of personalized medicine, with subsets of patients treated 
according to the genetic alterations of their tumour and PD-L1 status, which predict for benefit from 
targeted therapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), respectively. 
For patients without genetic drivers (e.g. EGFR, ALK, ROS1), treatment selection in clinical practice is 
usually based on PD-L1 expression or histology. For patients with high PD-L1 expression (i.e., PD-L1 
expressed in ≥50% of tumour cells), monotherapy with either pembrolizumab or atezolizumab or 
cemiplimab are acceptable approved. Conversely, regardless of PD-L1 expression, a series of 
combinations of immunotherapy with histology-selected platinum-based chemotherapy have also 
shown survival benefits, which led to EMA approval:  
• 
• 
Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel for squamous histology 
Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + pemetrexed for non-squamous histology 
•  Atezolizumab + bevacizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
•  Atezolizumab + carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
•  Nivolumab + ipilimumab + 2 cycles of platinum-doublet, regardless of histology 
Although immunochemotherapy treatments are the 1L standard-of-care in patients with advanced 
metastatic NSCLC whose tumours do not harbour driver mutations, new treatment options are 
required that can explore the potential of immunotherapy strategies and benefit a broader patient 
population. 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 113/119 
 
 
  
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
POSEIDON is a phase III, three-arm, randomised, multi-centre, open-label study in patients with 
metastatic NSCLC without EGFR or ALK aberrations, which compared durvalumab + chemotherapy 
(D+SoC, n=338) and tremelimumab + durvalumab + chemotherapy (T+D+SoC, n=338) to standard-
of-care histology-specific platinum-based chemotherapy (SoC, n=337).  
The dual primary endpoints of BICR-PFS and OS were analysed in the ITT of the D+SoC vs. SoC arms, 
while identical secondary endpoints were evaluated in the ITT of the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary OS endpoint (D+SoC vs SoC) in study POSEIDON did not meet statistical significance. 
However, the other primary PFS endpoint that compared the same arms showed statistical superiority 
and thus alpha was propagated to the next testing level, in which OS and PFS were evaluated as key 
secondary endpoints in the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms. 
•  At data cutoff 12-MAR-2021 and with median survival follow-up of 12.5 months, 800 deaths had 
occurred (79% of OS maturity) in the ITT population. Treatment with T+D+SoC showed a 
statistically significant survival benefit as compared with SoC: HR for OS was 0.77 (95% CI 0.65, 
0.92), p-value 0.00304. K-M estimates of median OS were 14.0 months in the T+D+SoC arm and 
11.7 months in the SoC arm. 
•  At data cutoff 24-JUL-2019, 749 PFS events (74% maturity) had occurred across the three arms of 
the trial. K-M estimated median PFS was numerically higher in the T+D+SoC arm (6.2 months) 
than in the SoC arm (4.8 months), while HR for PFS outlines the statistical advantage from 
T+D+SoC vs. SoC: 0.72 (95% CI 0.60, 0.86), p-value 0.00031. 
•  Secondary endpoints of ORR, DoR and PFS2 endorsed the advantage of T+D+SoC over SoC, as did 
subgroup and diverse sensitivity analyses.  
•  The benefit of T+D+SoC vs. SoC –in terms of OS, PFS and ORR– is maintained regardless of PD-L1 
expression status, i.e., above and below various PD-L1 cutoffs (1%, 25%, 50%). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  Acknowledging differences in study design –particularly selection of squamous (SQ) or non-
squamous (NSQ) histologies or allowing both– and limitations from cross-trial comparisons, it is 
noted that longer median survival was observed in akin studies in which only anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
agents were added to backbone platinum-based chemotherapy in the experimental arm. 
•  Even if the combination of T+D+SoC has demonstrated an improvement in OS, PFS and ORR 
compared with the SoC alone, the contribution of tremelimumab to this effect appears marginal in 
view of the results of a descriptive comparison with D+SoC. Since these analyses were not 
statistically powered, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. 
•  The OS benefit of T+D+SoC over SoC seems minimal in Asian patients and non-smokers. Of note, 
the smaller effect in the subgroup of non-smoker patients has already been observed in prior 
studies with immunotherapy. However, both subgroups were less represented in the T+D+SoC arm 
compared with the SoC arm. 
EMA/42901/2023 
Page 114/119 
 
 
  
 
 
• 
In elderly patients (≥75 years of age) a HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.71) for OS was reported for 
T+D+SoC (n=35) vs. SoC (n=40). The uncertainty regarding efficacy (and safety) in this subgroup 
of patients is reflected in the SmPC.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
•  AEs occurred in almost all patients across the three arms of POSEIDON. While high-grade (G3/4) 
AEs occurred in about half of the patients from each arm, G5 AEs were slightly more frequent in the 
experimental arms (12% in T+D+SoC, 10% D+SoC, 9% SoC), as were SAEs (44%, 40% and 35%, 
respectively) and AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment (22%, 24% and 15%, 
respectively).  
•  Typical chemotherapy-related AEs (anaemia, nausea, neutropenia, decreased appetite and fatigue) 
were the five most frequent AEs across the three arms of the trial, with slightly higher incidence in 
the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the SoC arm. Diarrhoea and rash, with potentially immune-
related pathophysiology, were considerably more frequent in the T+D+SoC arm than in the SoC 
arm (22% and 19% vs. 15% and 7%, respectively). 
•  The higher incidence of G≥3 AEs in the T+D+SoC arm (66% vs. 61% in SoC) is driven by G5 AEs 
(12.4% and 9%, respectively). The proportions of the most frequent G3/4 AEs were overall similar 
across the three arms of the trial, highlighting events of chemotherapy-related myelotoxicity, 
increases in pancreatic and hepatic enzymes and pneumonia. 
•  Regarding causality of AEs, it is difficult to elucidate which events could be caused by the 
chemotherapy component and which ones could be related to tremelimumab and/or durvalumab. 
Incidence of AEs reported with a ≥5% difference between both arms were: neutropenia (30.0% vs 
23.4%), diarrhoea (21.5% vs. 15.3%), rash (19.4% vs. 6.6%), pyrexia (16.1% vs. 6.9%), 
arthralgia (12.4% vs. 6.3%), hypothyroidism (11.8% vs. 1.2%), pruritus (10.9% vs. 4.5%), and 
hyperthyroidism (5.8% vs. 0.6%). 
•  There were 41 AEs leading to death (G5 AEs) in the T+D+SoC arm, 34 in the D+SoC arm and 30 in 
the SoC arm. Most of these events were related to infections and cardiac disorders, noting that 
twice as many toxic deaths from infections occurred in the T+D+SoC arm, as compared to the 
other two arms (15, 8 and 9, respectively). 
•  The proportion of patients with imAEs was 32% in the T+D+SoC arm, 17% in the D+SoC and 4% 
in the SoC arm. The distribution of specific imAEs in the D+SoC arm is typical for PD-L1 inhibition, 
with predominance of hypothyroidism (6%), hepatotoxicity (3%), pneumonitis (3%) and 
dermatitis/rash (2%). The T+D+SoC arm presented twice as many cases of immune-mediated 
diarrhoea/colitis than the D+SoC arm (14 vs. 6) and more cases of pneumonitis (14 vs. 9). 
Hypothyroidism was more frequent in the T+D+SoC arm (12%) than in the D+SoC (6%) or SoC 
(1%) arms.  
•  Pneumonia was the most frequent SAE in the trial, and its incidence in the T+D+SoC arm doubled 
that of the control arm SoC (11% vs. 5%). Serious myelotoxic events, likely related to 
chemotherapy, were also frequent in all three arms of the trial, with comparable incidence among 
them. Serious pneumonitis and colitis/diarrhoea were more prevalent in the T+D+SoC arm than in 
the other two arms. 
•  The overall proportion of patients that discontinued any treatment in the context of an AE was 
higher in the experimental arms (22% in T+D+SoC, 20% in D+SoC) than in the control arm 
(15%). The main AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment across the three arms of 
POSEIDON were pneumonia, anaemia and acute kidney injury.

•  Patients who were 75 years or older (11% from the pivotal trial) presented a significantly higher 
proportion of SAEs (74% in T+D+SoC vs. 56% SoC), high-grade AEs (71% vs. 64%), G5 AEs (40% 
vs. 14%) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (49% vs. 23%) as compared to their 
younger counterparts. Caution should be exerted when considering treatment of tremelimumab + 
durvalumab + chemotherapy in patients older than 75 years. A specific warning in sections 4.4 and 
4.8 was inserted.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The addition of immune checkpoint inhibition (PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4) to a platinum doublet has 
proven successful at prolonging survival in advanced driver-negative NSCLC: a series of trials 
conducted concurrently in the last few years –the majority depicting add-on design with platinum-
based chemotherapy as control– have shown improved efficacy outcomes of the experimental arms. 
Indeed, current guidelines across the globe highlight a plethora of immunochemotherapy regimens 
that are recommended for the initial approach in a treatment-naïve setting. While most of these 
combinations are appropriate regardless of tumoral PD-L1 expression, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as 
monotherapy are also adequate choices for high-expressors (≥50% of tumour cells).  
Albeit strictly unsuccessful for its primary OS endpoint in the D+SoC vs. SoC arms, the overall efficacy 
outcome of pivotal trial POSEIDON parallels results of other similar studies, noting statistically 
improved OS and PFS for the T+D+SoC vs. SoC comparisons. Upon appropriate maturity of the 
database, beneficial effects were observed across different PD-L1 cut-offs. Importantly, however, the 
exploratory comparisons between the experimental arms seem to suggest a borderline efficacious 
advantage of the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab and chemotherapy, challenging the clinical 
relevance of double immune checkpoint inhibition, especially in the light of added immune toxicity 
risks. 
As thoroughly depicted in the safety section, all the categories of adverse events present numerically 
higher incidence in the experimental arms, particularly in the 4-drug combination implied in the 
therapeutic indication of tremelimumab. As expected, immune-mediated events prevailed in both 
experimental arms, and although the majority were low-grade and manageable (e.g. hypothyroidism, 
rash), potentially symptomatic events (e.g. diarrhoea/colitis, pneumonitis) occurred predominantly in 
the tremelimumab arm. Undeniably, if dual PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibition plus chemotherapy are 
considered for advanced NSCLC, toxicity and tolerability concerns are to be taken into account, 
particularly for more frail or elderly patients. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy data from the POSEIDON trial are sufficiently mature: it seems unlikely that updated results 
would alter the current conclusions.  
Although the combination of tremelimumab, durvalumab and platinum-based does not seem to fill an 
unmet medical need in the current therapeutic paradigm of advanced NSCLC, it could be considered 
another appropriate chemoimmunotherapy regimen in this palliative setting. 
The addition of tremelimumab and durvalumab to chemotherapy results in considerably increased 
toxicity, in particular relating to higher incidence of serious and grade 5 adverse events. Furthermore, 
the symptomatic burden and safety risks from immune-mediate events whose incidence raise with 
CTLA-4 blockade –e.g. colitis/diarrhoea, pneumonitis– are a particular concern from added 
tremelimumab. Special caution must be exerted when considering this regimen for patients ≥75 years. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Imfinzi in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic NSCLC with no sensitising EGFR 
mutations or ALK positive mutations is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change:

approved one  
Extension of indication to include first-line treatment, with Imfinzi in combination with tremelimumab 
and platinum-based chemotherapy, of adults with metastatic NSCLC with no sensitizing epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive mutations, 
based on final results from Study D419MC00004 (POSEIDON); This was a Phase III, randomised, 
multicentre, open-label, comparative global study to determine the efficacy and safety of 
tremelimumab and durvalumab or durvalumab in combination with platinum based chemotherapy for 
first-line treatment in patients with metastatic NSCLC. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 
4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, 
the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10.2. Version 8.1 of the RMP has also been submitted.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

3 to 17 years. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated and the 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Further, the MAH proposed to update section 4.4 with 
information on sodium and potassium content in line with the excipients guideline, as well as to add 
wording on traceability. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10.2, the MAH performed minor editorial changes and removed information related to 
the withdrawn of the Prepandrix marketing authorisation. Version 13 of the RMP has also been 
submitted. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Not applicable. 
Article 8 does not apply as the authorised medicinal product is not protected by a supplementary 
protection certificate under Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 or by a patent which qualifies for the 
granting of the supplementary protection. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Adjupanrix is a split virion, inactivated, AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. It is 
currently indicated for intramuscular use in adults ≥18 years of age and intended for prophylaxis of 
influenza in the case of an officially declared pandemic.   
Disease or condition 
Influenza  viruses  are  enveloped  negative-strand  RNA  viruses.  The  RNA  genome  of  influenza  viruses 
consists of seven to eight gene segments, each coding for at least one protein. Reassortment, the process 
of influenza viruses combining and rearranging gene segments, can occur when two differing influenza 
viruses,  for  example  an  animal  and  human  subtype,  co-infect  a cell.  This  process  results  in  antigenic 
shift which causes major changes in the influenza type A haemagglutinin (HA) antigen. This in turn can, 
in rare events, result in strains capable of causing large regional or global pandemic outbreaks.  
An  influenza  pandemic  is  a  global  outbreak  of  influenza  disease  that  occurs  when  a  type  A  influenza 
strain to which most or all humans are immunologically naïve emerges to cause clinically apparent illness, 
and  then  spreads  easily  from  person  to  person  worldwide.  Pandemics  are  different  from  seasonal 
outbreaks  of  influenza,  as  the  latter  are  caused  by  subtypes  of  influenza  viruses  that  are  already 
circulating in the world whereas pandemics are caused by new subtypes or by subtypes that have not 
circulated among people for a long time. 
Influenza pandemics are unpredictable and occur infrequently but have consequences on human health 
and  economic  well-being  (WHO,  2017).  Previous  experience  with  the  2009  swine-origin  influenza 
A(H1N1) pandemic showed that children were the most affected age category (Jain, 2009; Miller, 2010), 
probably due to higher exposure in schools or the lack of pre-existing immunity as seen in the elderly, 
who have likely encountered the virus earlier in life (Cobey, 2017).  
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The MAH proposed the following indication: 
Adjupanrix is indicated in adults and children from 6 months of age for prophylaxis of influenza in an 
officially declared pandemic situation. 
The use of Adjupanrix should be in accordance with official guidance. 
The application was based on safety and immunogenicity data from the one Phase 3 trial, one single-
arm Phase 2 trial, one Phase 2 dose finding study and one additional supportive study. 
During the procedure it was decided that section 4.1 should not be amended, as vaccines registered 
through the 'mock-up' vaccine procedure prior the authorisation of a 'pandemic' variation are not

indicated in a prepandemic setting (the indication has been restricted to the use during a pandemic 
phase). When a pandemic situation is duly recognised by the WHO or the Union, the MAH should 
submit a variation to include the declared pandemic strain in the pandemic vaccine.  
Section 4.1 has therefore not been amended and reads: 
Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.  
Adjupanrix should be used in accordance with official guidance 
Epidemiology  
Influenza usually occurs in winter outbreaks or epidemics (in temperate climates). People of all ages are 
afflicted, but the prevalence is greatest in school-age children; disease severity is greatest in infants, 
the aged, and those with underlying illnesses.  
An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza virus appears against which the human population 
has no immunity, and the emergent virus acquires the capacity to spread efficiently in humans. This can 
result in simultaneous epidemic disease in many locations worldwide, with substantial number of deaths 
and illnesses. Preceding the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the last century witnessed three influenza pandemics, 
the "Spanish Flu" in 1918–1919, the "Asian Flu" in 1957 and the "Hong Kong Flu" in 1968 [Kilbourne, 
2006] - all arising from avian influenza viruses.  
Avian influenza viruses have several subtypes, but highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, have 
been associated with hundreds of identified human cases since 1997. Between 2003 and July 18, 2018, 
860  laboratory-confirmed  human  cases  of  H5N1  virus  infection  were  officially  reported  to  the  World 
Health Organization (WHO) from 16 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, America and the Near East, with 
an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 53% [WHO, 2018].  
Almost  all  of  these  cases  have  been  epidemiologically  linked  to  close  contact  with  poultry,  and  while 
human-to-human transmission has been sporadic, H5N1 HPAI viruses represent a pandemic threat. 
Biologic features 
Influenza viruses are classified into types A, B and C on the basis of their core proteins. Type A viruses, 
which are able to cause pandemics, are further subdivided according to their envelope glycoproteins with 
haemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) activity.  
The  virus  is  transmitted  primarily  by  droplets  or  respiratory  secretions  of  infected  patients.  The  virus 
binds to and enters the tracheobronchial ciliated epithelium by utilising the viral surface haemagglutinin. 
Viral replication then occurs. Peak viral shedding occurs in the first 48 to 72 hours of exposure to the 
virus, then declines and becomes undetectable within 10 days. Children and immunocompromised people 
may shed virus for several weeks.

Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Influenza is an acute respiratory disease which is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, coryza, 
cough, headache, prostration, malaise, and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. In the majority 
of cases, pneumonic involvement is not clinically prominent. Acute symptoms and fever often persist for 
7 to 10 days. Weakness and fatigue may linger for weeks.  
People  with  diabetes  mellitus  or  chronic  pulmonary  or  cardiac  disease,  are  at  high  risk  of  developing 
severe  complications  from  influenza  A  viruses.  Severe  complications  can  consist  of  haemorrhagic 
bronchitis, pneumonia (primary viral or secondary bacterial), and death. Haemorrhagic bronchitis and 
pneumonia  can  develop  within  hours.  Fulminant  fatal  influenza  viral  pneumonia  occasionally  occurs; 
dyspnoea, cyanosis, haemoptysis, pulmonary oedema, and death may proceed in as little as 48 hours 
after the onset of symptoms. 
Management 
Vaccination is the most effective way of preventing and controlling the spread of influenza in the human 
population. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK) has developed H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccines. GSK 
manufactures split virion seasonal influenza vaccines at two GSK facilities, one in Dresden Germany and 
the other in Québec Canada (the subsequent vaccines are indicated with the prefix D and Q respectively). 
The pandemic vaccine H5N1 split virus antigens are produced using a process similar to that used for 
the production of seasonal influenza vaccine, and are adjuvanted with GSK’s AS03 adjuvant system. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Adjupanrix is a split virion, inactivated, AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. The 
influenza strain contained in the vaccine is a strain derived from the highly pathogenic avian influenza 
strain A/Vietnam/1194/2004. This vaccine strain A was developed by a World Health Organization 
(WHO) collaborating centre [National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), UK]. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Development programme 
The clinical development program for Adjupanrix to support licensure in children 6 months of age and 
older consists of 1 Phase 3 study, D-PAN H5N1-032, 1 Phase 2 single arm study, D-PAN H5N1-013, the 
Phase 2 dose-finding study Q-PAN H5N1-023 and the supportive study Q-PAN H5N1-021. 
Compliance with CHMP guidance 
The most relevant CHMP guidelines applied: 
“Guideline on Influenza vaccines; Non-clinical and Clinical Module” (CPMP/VWP/457259/2014) 
Scientific Advice 
During  the  course  of  development,  the  sponsor  sought  regulatory  and  scientific  advice  from  EMA’s 
Assessment report  
Page 9/10 
 
 
  
 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) once. This advice is detailed below: 
EMEA/H/SA/3998/1/2018/PED/II.  The  MAH  sought  advice  on  the  clinical  development  with 
regards to the use of half the adult dose in the paediatric population and adequacy of the available data 
package to  support an extension of the indication. CHMP agreed that the clinical data  package would 
suffice for the proposed extension, and it was agreed that study Q-PAN H5N1-024 was not required. In 
addition,  the  accumulated  immunogenicity  data  from  a  combination  of  D-Pan  and  Q-Pan  studies  do 
support selection of the 1.9μg/AS03B (i.e. half the adult dose) from the age of 6 months but also suggest 
that one quarter of the adult dose may suffice and may be safer in children aged < 36 months. Therefore, 
subject to a full assessment of the data at the time of filing, it may be that the CHMP concludes that a 
quarter of the adult dose is suitable between the ages of 6-35 months and half the adult dose from 3-
17 years. Finally, the application dossier should contain a full review of all the evidence that has emerged 
from investigations into the possible mechanism(s) underlying the association between narcolepsy and 
D-Pan-H1N1. 
Conclusion of VWP based on the review of the data in connection to the scientific advice 
The AS03 adjuvant is linked to substantial local reactogenicity and fever even in adults, which increases 
with decreasing age. The VWP accepted that the data could support use of half the adult dose down to 
3 years of age. In infants and toddler from 6 months to 36 months of age the VWP agreed with the co-
ordinators  that  a  quarter  adult  dose  may  be  preferable  since  it  seemed  sufficiently  immunogenic 
(including in cross-immunogenicity studies) and had a slightly better safety profile than the half adult 
dose. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Refer to clinical efficacy section below for immunogenicity data 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The overall objective of the clinical development program was to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of Adjupanrix administered as a 2-dose regimen in children aged 6 months to <18 
years of age. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
With  the  approval  of  D-Pan  H5N1  products  by  the  European  Commission,  GSK  committed  to  conduct 
several paediatric studies using half the adult dose (containing 1.9 µg H5N1 HA antigen adjuvanted with 
AS03B [containing 5.93 mg of tocopherol]) as part of the initially agreed D-Pan H5N1 PIP (PIP-EMEA-
000160-PIP01-M01).  In  response  to  concerns  raised  by  the  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO)  during  the 
review rounds for the PIP on the lack of traditional dose-ranging studies (EMA/PDCO summary report 
EMA/737469/2010) and to align the paediatric development plans for D-Pan H5N1 in the EU with those 
proposed for Q-Pan H5N1 in the US, GSK added two additional paediatric studies to the D-Pan H5N1 PIP 
(EMA decision EMA/480049/2012):. 
• 
• 
Q-Pan-H5N1-023, a dose-ranging study in children 6 months to less than 36 months of age,  
Q-Pan H5N1-024, a dose-confirmatory study in children 6 months to less than 18 years of age.  
The addition of both studies was endorsed by PDCO (EMA decision EMA/597267/2013). 
Based on CHMP advice (EMEA/H/SA/3998/1/2018/PEDII), study Q-PAN H5N1-024 was cancelled. There 
was sufficient data available to describe the safety and immunogenicity of half the adult dose from 3 
years to 17 years (study D-H5N1-009 [previously assessed not included in current submission], D-PAN 
H5N1-032  and  Q-PAN  H5N1-021).  These  data  are  considered  to  support  this  dose  regimen,  as 
immunogenicity was good and the safety profile of a half adult dose is likely better than that of a full 
adult dose. In children aged 6 months to 36 months, full assessment of the data at time of filing was 
considered required to conclude on the best dose in this age group. However, the results from study Q-
PAN H5N1-023 was considered sufficient to be able to make this assessment, and therefore study Q-
PAN H5N1-024 was not considered necessary. 
Study Q-PAN H5N1-023 
Study  Design:  Study  Q-PAN  H5N1-023  was  a  Phase  II,  observer-blind,  randomized,  dose-ranging, 
multi-center, multi-country study to evaluate safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of alternative

dosing regimens with adjuvanted Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine given as a 2-dose primary series in children 6 to 
less than 36 months of age. All subjects received 3.75 µg HA, unadjuvanted H5N1 vaccine as a booster 
dose at Day 385. The vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the left anterolateral thigh (Days 0 
and 385) or right anterolateral thigh (Day 21).  
Treatment: Participants in Study Q-PAN H5N1-023 were randomly assigned to one of 5 study groups 
in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Subjects received 2 priming doses of adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine (the first at the Day 
0 visit; the second at the Day 21 visit) followed by a single dose of unadjuvanted H5N1 vaccine at the 
Day 385 visit. 
The treatment groups were as follows: 
•  190_B: 1.9 µg H5N1 HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03B (containing 5.93 mg of tocopherol) 
•  090_C: 0.9 µg H5N1 HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03C (containing 2.965 mg of tocopherol) 
•  190_C: 1.9 µg H5N1 HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03C (containing 2.965 mg of tocopherol) 
•  375_C: 3.75 µg H5N1 HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03C (containing 2.965 mg of tocopherol) 
•  375_D: 3.75 µg H5N1 HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03D (containing 1.4825 mg of tocopherol) 
Study Participants:  The  study  population  consisted  of  healthy  male  or  female  children  6  months  to 
less than 36 months old at time of first study vaccination. In total 185 subjects were enrolled. Duration 
of the study for each subject was approximately 415 days after the first dose of vaccine. 
Objectives: The co-primary objectives of the study were to assess the performance of alternative dosing 
regimens for primary immunization with Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine using an immunogenicity-fever index that 
considers  immunogenicity  by  HI  assay  /  MN  assay  21  days  after  the  second  priming  dose  and  fever 
scores after the first and second priming doses, and to assess the performance of dosing regimens for 
booster immunization with Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine considering immune response by HI / MN assay 7 days 
after a 12-month booster dose of 3.75 μg HA Q-Pan H5N1 unadjuvanted antigen. 
The secondary objectives of the study were 1) to assess HI immune response to the vaccine homologous 
virus 21 days after the second dose of each priming regimen, 2) to assess the performance of alternative 
dosing regimens for primary immunization with Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine considering persistence of immune 
response by HI and MN assay at Day 385 in terms of persistence index, 3) to assess the performance of 
the H5N1 vaccine regimens in terms of vaccine homologous and heterologous HI and MN antibody titres 
on Days 0, 42, 385 and 392, 4) to assess vaccine induced cell-mediated immune response (frequency 
of CD3+/CD4+/CD8+ T-cells) on Days 0, 42, 385 and 392. and 5) to describe the reactogenicity and 
safety of the different priming regimens and the safety of the unadjuvanted booster dose. 
Demographics:  Table  1  presents  the  demographic  characteristics.  The  mean  age  of  the  subjects  at 
vaccination  Dose  1  ranged  from  20.3  months  of  age  (375_D  group)  to  22.6  months  of  age  (090_C 
group).  There  was  an  unequal  distribution  of  males  and  females  across  groups:  fewer  females  were 
observed in the 190_B, 090_C and 190_C groups. Overall, most subjects were of East Asian and South 
East Asian heritages.

An adjusted GMT was constructed, using ANCOVA which was fitted on the log10 transformed HI and MN 
antibody responses at Day 42, with the vaccine group as a fixed independent variable, adjusted by the 
log10 transformed pre-vaccination titer and age. The use of pre-vaccination titre and age was not well 
understood  as  all  children  were  naïve  for  H5N1  based  on  exclusion  criteria  and  pre-vaccination  GMTs 
and randomisation included a minimization procedure accounting for age. In addition, only using body 
temperature measurements performed from Days 0-2 after each dose to construct the fever index was 
not understood. Solicited symptoms, such as fever, are collected for 7 days post-vaccination. 
The usefulness of this immunogenicity-fever-index for both the HI as well as the MN antibodies is limited.  
The totality of all immunogenicity and safety results have been evaluated to determine which dose is 
considered  appropriate  for  children.  Assessment  of  the  totality  of  evidence  have  been  based  on  the 
immunogenicity  aspects  mentioned  in  the  Guideline  on  Influenza  Vaccines.  Please  see  section  on 
secondary endpoints. 
The mean geometric increase (MGI) for HI and MN antibodies at Day 392 (12 days post booster dose) 
relative to Day 385 (pre-booster dose) is presented in Table 3.  
The highest MGI for HI antibodies at Day 392 relative to Day 385 was observed in 090_C group (6.6) 
followed by 190_B (4.9) for the homologous strain with the GMT values being 98.1 and 476.2 for 190_B 
group and 61.5 and 407.6 for 090_C group, at Day 385 and Day 392, respectively. 
The highest MGI for MN antibodies at Day 392 relative to Day 385 was observed in 090_C group (4.8) 
followed  by  190_B  (4.3)  for  the  homologous  strain  with  the  GMT  values  being  250.3  and  1085.0  for 
190_B group and 203.6 and 969.1 for 090_C group, at Day 385 and Day 392, respectively.

At  12  months  after  the  primary  vaccination  regimen,  GMTs  for  both  HI  and  MN  antibodies  were 
numerically  higher  in  group  190-B  (half  adult  dose)  compared  to  the  other  groups.  The  homologous 
GMTs  for  both  HI  and  MN  antibodies  were  higher  in  the  190_C  group  compared  to  the  090_C  group 
(quarter adult dose), while heterologous GMTs for both HI and MN antibodies were higher in the 090_C 
group compared to the 190_C group. Lowest responses were seen for groups 375_C and 375_D. 
At D392, 10 days after the booster with unadjuvanted A/Indonesia H5N1 vaccine, GMTs for both HI and 
MN antibodies were highest in group 190-B (half adult dose) followed by group 090_C. However, group 
090-C showed the highest GMT ratio (GMT D392/D385) for both HI and MN antibodies, indicating that 
the boost induced the highest response in this group. Again lowest responses were seen for 375_C and 
375_D. 
With respect to ability to induce an immune response by the unadjuvanted booster vaccine 1 year after 
the primary vaccination, group 090_C was able to induced the highest response as measured by GMT 
ratio followed by 190_B for both vaccine-homologous and -heterologous HI and MN antibodies.  
Secondary Endpoints 
HI antibodies 
A summary of vaccine homologous and heterologous HI antibody parameters, GMT, seroconversion rate 
(SCR) and MGI for homologous and a selected heterologous antibody (Flu A/Vietnam/1194/2004 H5N1) 
are presented in Table 4. 
At Day 42, all formulations elicited a strong homologous H5N1 immune response by HI assay with SCR 
(100%), and MGI (range: 101.0 [375_D group] – 219.5 [190_B group]). In addition, non-overlapping 
CIs  for  the  HI  GMTs  were  observed  between  the  reference  group  190_B  and  the  groups  375_C  and 
375_D, whereas for the 2 other formulations (090_C or 190_C), a trend for a higher immune response 
in the group 190_B was observed.

At Day 385, one year after the primary vaccination, the vaccine-homologous HI antibody titres declined 
for all formulations at Day 385. Antibody responses were sustained with seroconversion rate above 40% 
for all formulations. The reference group, 190_B, had the highest SCR of 97.1% (95% CI: 84.7, 99.9) 
among all groups. 
At  Day  385,  the  MGIs  (Day  385/Day  0)  were  19.2-fold,  12.0-fold,  14.0-fold,  15.8-fold  and  10.5-fold 
higher_  than  baseline  for  190_B,  090_C,  190_C,  375_C  and  375_D  groups,  respectively.  The  190_B 
group showed a trend of higher GMTs at Day 385 and Day 392 among the formulations studied 
At Day 392, 7 days after antigen challenge (unadjuvanted booster), the seroconversion rate was 100% 
for all formulations. The MGI (Day 392/Day 0) were 93.3-fold, 79.8-fold, 59.4-fold, 57.2-fold and 35.3-
fold higher than baseline for 190_B, 090_C, 190_C, 375_C and 375_D groups, respectively). 
In  terms  of  cross-reactivity  against  heterologous  H5  influenza  virus  isolates,  the  highest  HI  antibody 
titres were observed against the Flu A/duck/Bangladesh/19097/2013 (H5N1) isolate, the clade of which 
is closest to the vaccine strain, followed by the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) isolate. The 190_B group 
showed a trend of higher cross reactivity against 3 heterologous strains than the other groups.

The clinical impact of the achieved immune response is unknown as there is no correlate of protection. 
Reverse  cumulative  distribution  curves  (RCDCs)  and  tables  presenting  percentages  of  vaccinees  with 
titres above a cut-off levels on a logarithmic scale (titres above 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000) at all timepoints 
for the different groups were provided upon request. The RCDC curves show that the immune responses 
are highest in groups 190_B, 090_C and 190_C. For all groups the curves show a similar shape, indicating 
Assessment report  
Page 20/21 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
a similar response though reduced in some groups, especially in groups 375_C and 375_D. These data 
are also reflected in the table containing the percentage of participants with titres above cut-off levels. 
At Day 42, 21 days after the last vaccination of the primary vaccination series, all formulations induced 
a  substantial  vaccine-homologous  HI  antibody  response,  as  SCR  was  100%  for  all  formulations.  In 
addition, SCR for a heterologous H5N1 HI antigen (Flu/Vietnam) was >80% in all groups, indicating that 
21 days after a primary vaccination series using all doses, a substantial immune response was generated 
to a antigenically drifted strain. An immune response to an H5N8 strain could also be detected, leading 
to SCR of 56.7% in group 190_B, 37.5% in group 090_C, 29.4% in group 190_C, 20.0% in group 375_C 
and 26.7% in group 375_D. 
The  H5N1  vaccination  induced  both  vaccine-homologous  and  -heterologous  HI  antibody  titres  in  all 
groups,  which  declined  over  time  but  remained  above  baseline  for  1  year.  A  booster  dose  of 
unadjuvanted vaccine 1 year after the primary vaccination was able to elicit an immune response in all 
groups,  however  this  response  measured  after  7  days  was  lower  compared  to  the  initial  immune 
response  seen  at  D42.  The  highest  immune  responses  were  seen  in  groups  190_B  and  090_C.  The 
immune  response  in  group  090_C,  receiving  a  quarter  dose,  was  only  slightly  lower  compared  to  the 
response seen for group 190_B, receiving half the adult dose. 
All participants in all groups were seropositive for homologous HI antibodies at 1 year postvaccination. 
For  heterologous  HI  antibodies,  seronegative  participants  did  occur,  however,  for  both  Flu 
A/duck/Bangladesh/19097/2013 and Flu A/Vietnam/1194/2004 the maximum number of participants in 
each  group  being  seronegative  was  6.  For  Flu  A/gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014,  the  number  of 
seronegatives  ranged  from  11  to  19.  For  both  group  109_B  and  090_C,  there  was  no  difference  in 
seroconversion  rate  in  seropositive  and  seronegative  participants,  with  approximately  50%  in  both 
groups  being  seropositive  after  the  booster  dose.  For  groups  190_C,  375_C  and  375_D,  the 
seroconversion rate was higher in seropositive participants versus seronegative participants. 
In conclusion, the highest immune response was seen in the 190_B group receiving the half adult dose. 
However,  a  quarter  adult  dose,  090_C,  induced  an  immune  response  that  was  only  slightly  less 
immunogenic, as seen for example by GMT 95% CI that overlap. At 21 days post primary vaccination, 
both doses induced SCR of 100% for homologous antibodies and >90% for heterologous antibodies.  
MN antibodies 
A summary of vaccine homologous and heterologous MN antibody parameters, GMT, vaccine response 
rate (VRR) and MGI, for homologous and 1 heterologous antibody (Flu A/Vietnam/1194/2004 H5N1) are 
presented in Table 7. 
Results for immune response assessment by MN assay were similar to HI assay. Neutralizing antibody 
parameters (seropositivity rates, GMT, and VRR) peaked at Day 42 and persisted well above baseline in 
all vaccine groups at Day 385. The Day 392 immune response results by MN were similar to the HI assay 
results.

RCDCs and tables presenting percentages of vaccinees with titres above cut-off levels on a logarithmic 
scale (titres above 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000) at all timepoints for the different groups were provided. The 
RCDC curves show that the immune responses are highest in groups 190_B and 090_C. For all groups, 
the curves show a similar shape, indicating a similar response though reduced in some groups, especially 
375_C and 375_D. These data are also reflected in the table containing the percentage of participants 
with titres above cut-off levels.  
The MN antibody results were generally in line with the HI antibody results, indicating a robust immune 
response. 
At Day 42, 21 days after the last vaccination of the primary vaccination series, all formulations induced 
a substantial vaccine-homologous immune response by MN assay, as VRR was 100% for all formulations. 
At Day 42, vaccine-homologous GMTs were highest in Group 190_B, followed by 090_C, 190_C, 375_C 
and lastly 375_D.  
The  H5N1  vaccination  induced  both  vaccine-homologous  and  -heterologous  MN  antibody  titres  in  all 
groups, which declined over time but remained well above baseline for 1 year. VRR for homologous MN 
antibodies was 100% 1 year after the primary vaccination and ranged from 77.1% (190_C) to 93.3% 
(375_C)  for  heterologous  MN  antibodies.  A  booster  dose  of  unadjuvanted  vaccine  1  year  after  the 
primary  vaccination  was  able  to  elicit  an  immune  response  in  all  groups,  leading  to  VRR  for  both 
homologous and heterologous MN antibodies of >90%.  
All participants in all groups were seropositive for homologous MN antibodies at 1 year postvaccination. 
For  heterologous  MN  antibodies,  seronegative  participants  did  occur,  however,  for  both  Flu 
A/duck/Bangladesh/19097/2013 and Flu A/Vietnam/1194/2004 the maximum number of participants in 
each group being seronegative was 5. Due to the low number of seronegative participants at D385, no 
conclusion  can  be  drawn  in  this  group,  although  the  fact  that  all  seronegative  subjects  became 
seropositive  is  a  good  sign.  In  seropositive  participants,  VRR  for  homologous  MN  antibodies  at  D392 
relative to D385 ranged from 37.8% (375_C) to 72.7 (090_C), while VRR for heterologous MN antibodies 
was considerably lower, ranging from 16.1% (375_C) to 28.1 (190_B).  
In conclusion, as seen with HI antibodies, the highest immune response was seen in the 190_B group 
receiving the half adult dose. However, a quarter adult dose, 090_C, induced an immune response that 
was only slightly less immunogenic, as seen for example by GMT 95% CI that overlap. At 21 days post 
primary  vaccination,  both  doses  induced  VRR  of  100%  for  homologous  antibodies  and  >80%  for 
heterologous antibodies.

Cellular immune response 
CMI parameters at Day 0, 42, 385 and 392 were evaluated: 
–  Antigen-specific  CD4+/CD8+  T  Cells  identified  as  CD4/CD8+  T-cells  producing  two  or  more 
markers within CD40L, IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ upon in vitro stimulation using A/Indonesia/05/2005 
(H5N1) split virus, 
–  The frequency of the response for CD4+/CD8+T-cells stained with probes for various cytokines 
and  activation  marker  (IFN-  γ,  TNF-  α,  IL-2,  CD40L)  and  elicited  by  vaccine  components 
measured in a sub-cohort of approximately 20 subjects per group at Days 0, 42, 385 and 392 
were  described  according  to  the  technical  specifications  provided  by  R&D  (Clinical  Data  – 
Information Sheet). 
CMI data were analysed based on the total vaccinated sub-cohort (TVC CMI sub-cohort) for the subjects 
with CMI results available. 
A total of 100 subjects were included in the TVC CMI sub-cohort (21 in the 190_B group, 21 in the 090_C 
group, 20 in the 190_C group, 19 in the 375_D group and 19 in the 375_D group). 
A trend for higher CD4+ T-cell responses was observed at Day 42 for the reference group (190_B). For 
all formulations, CD4+ T cell responses were higher than baseline at all time points, see Table 10.  
No vaccine specific CD8+ T cells response was detected in any of the groups, see Table 11.

upon in vitro stimulation using Flu A/Indonesia/05/2005 virus strain at D0, 42, 385 and 392 (TVC CMI 
sub cohort) (Q-PAN H5N1-023) 
CD4 T-cells increased after in vitro stimulation with A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) split virus in all groups, 
while CD8 T-cells did not increase. However, even the increase in CD4 T-cells is minimal as an increase 
of approximately 2000 cells/million cells was observed, indicating an increase of 0.2%. 
As the percentage of vaccinated subjects eliminated from the ATP cohort was more than 5% in at least 
1 group, a secondary analysis was performed on the TVC. 
The results of the TVC secondary analysis were in line with the results for the ATP cohort, which was 
reassuring and indicative of a robust response. 
Both half adult dose and a quarter adult dose induced a substantial immune response. Numerically the 
response to half adult dose was higher compared to the quarter dose at all time points measured as well 
as considering the heterologous response, however, only a slight decrease in immunogenicity was seen 
at Day 42 of which the clinical relevance is unknown.

Safety 
In general, the majority of subjects reported at least 1 solicited AE in both 190_B and 090_C groups. 
Incidence of solicited AEs, Grade 3 AEs and vaccine-related Grade 3 AEs was highest in group 190_B. 
The solicited AEs were of short duration (<3 days). 
Pain was the most frequently reported solicited local reaction, reported by 16 subjects (42.1%) in group 
190_B and 11 subjects (29.7%) in group 090_C. Grade 3 pain was reported by 2 subjects (5.3%) in 
group 190_B and none in group 090_C. The mean duration of pain was 2.6 days in group 190_B and 
1.9 days in group 090_C.  
The most frequently reported systemic AEs were drowsiness and fever in group 190_B (reported by 23 
subjects [60.5%]) and drowsiness in group 090_C (reported by 16 subjects [43.2%]). Mean duration of 
drowsiness, irritability and loss of appetite was short <3 days in all groups. 
Vaccine-related fever occurred in 22 subjects (57.9%) in group 190_B and 12 subjects (32.4%) in group 
090_C. An increased incidence of fever, but not of other systemic solicited AEs, was observed after the 
second dose in groups 190_B and 090_C. Grade 3 fever (39.0-40.0˚C) related to the vaccine occurred 
in 5 subjects (13.2%) in group 190_B and 2 subjects (5.2%) in group 090_C. The mean duration of the 
fever was short (<2 days) for all groups. 
Each of the solicited systemic AEs occurred at a higher frequency in group 190_B compared to the other 
groups. 
The majority of participants reported at least 1 unsolicited AE; 23 subjects (60.5%) in group 190_B and 
20  subjects  (54.1%)  in  group  090_C.  Of  these  the  number  of  subjects  reporting  a  vaccine-related 
unsolicited AE was 3 (7.9%) in group 190_B and 0 (0.0%) in group 090_C. 
All in all, the safety profile of the half adult dose was worse compared to the quarter dose. Incidence of 
solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs was higher in group 190_B. This worse safety profile is mainly driven 
by  fever;  the  incidence  of  all  fever  and  Grade  3  fever  was  approximately  twice  as  high  in  the  190_B 
group compared to the 090_C group. 
As  conclusion  on  the  dose  finding  study,  all  dosing  regimens  elicited  a  robust  vaccine-homologous 
immune response at Day 42, as both SCR (evaluating HI antibodies) and VRR (evaluating MN antibodies) 
were 100% for all formulations.  
The dosing regimens of groups 190_B and 090_C elicited the highest immune response of all groups for 
HI and MN antibodies. Although numerically the response in group 190_B was higher, the increase in 
immunogenicity was considered small. At Day 42, SCR and VRR to homologous stimulation was 100% 
in both groups. Heterologous stimulation led to an SCR and VRR of 100% in group 190_B and >91% in 
group  090_C.  For  both  HI  and  MN  antibodies,  the  unadjuvanted  vaccine  1  year  after  the  primary 
vaccination was able to elicit a robust vaccine-homologous and -heterologous immune response in both 
groups, though this response was lower compared to the original response at D42.  
In  all  groups,  the  majority  of  subjects  reported  at  least  1  solicited  AE  in  all  groups.  The  incidence  of 
solicited AEs, vaccine-related Grade 3 solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs was highest in group 190_B.  
In young children, aged 6 months to 36 months, fever is an AE of concern as especially in children in 
this age category it can lead to febrile seizures. The likelihood of a febrile seizure is related to the height 
of temperature during the fever. Febrile seizures have been linked to vaccination in some cases, including 
Pandemrix.

Vaccine-related fever occurred in 22 subjects (57.9%) in group 190_B, 12 subjects (32.4%) in group 
090_C and Grade 3 fever (39.0-40.0˚C) related to the vaccine occurred in 5 subjects (13.2%) in group 
190_B, 2 subjects (5.2%) in group 090_C. These results indicate an incidence of fever and severe fever 
that was approximately twice as high in group 190_B compared to group 090_C. A post-hoc analysis 
based on cross-study comparisons showed that the reported incidence of fever was higher than expected 
for group 190_B in this study, however, this increase in fever reporting would reasonably also have been 
expected to occur across all groups including 090_C.  
Overall, the immunogenicity data showed that a quarter adult dose was only slightly less immunogenic 
compared to a half adult dose, whilst there is less reactogenicity when using the quarter adult dose. 
This  conclusion  is  in  line  with  previous  advice  from  VWP  given  in  relation  to  scientific  advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/3998/1/2018/PED/II). In infants and toddler from 6 months to 36 months of age the VWP 
concluded  that  a  quarter  adult  dose  may  be  preferable  since  it  seemed  sufficiently  immunogenic 
(including in cross-immunogenicity studies) and had a slightly better safety profile than the half adult 
dose. In addition, the VWP concluded that a further study of the quarter adult dose in this age was not 
required as the data would be sufficient to conclude on a posology. When deciding this, the VWP took 
into  account  the  ethical  controversies  around  vaccinating  children  with  H5N1  in  lack  of  an  imminent 
threat. 
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
Methods 
Study D-PAN H5N1-013 was a phase II, multicentre, non-randomized, open-label, prime-boost study, 
to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the adjuvanted (pre-) pandemic H5N1 influenza candidate 
vaccine following a heterologous prime-boost schedule (six months apart) in children 6 to 35 months of 
age. 
Study  D-PAN  H5N1-032  was  a  phase  III,  single-centre,  randomized,  open-label,  active-controlled, 
prime-boost study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a prime-boost schedule of the H5N1 
candidate vaccine adjuvanted with AS03B administered to children aged 3 to 17 years old. 
The fact that study D-PAN H5N1-013 is an open-label, single arm study, was considered unfortunate as 
there  is  no  comparison  for  reactogenicity.  The  single  arm  design  was  considered  acceptable  from  an 
immunogenicity perspective. 
For study D-PAN H5N1-032, the open-label character of the study was regretted, as it might affect safety 
reporting. However, it was understood that unnecessary blood draws and vaccinations were not wanted 
in the young population. Again here, no impact was expected on the immunogenicity outcomes. 
Study participants 
Both  studies  enrolled  healthy  paediatric  subjects,  as  established  by  medical  history  and  clinical 
examination before entering the study, for whom the investigator believed that the parents/LAR(s) could 
and would comply with the requirements of the protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from 
the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject (assent was obtained from the subject when applicable).  
Assessment report

Study  D-PAN  H5N1-013  enrolled  healthy  (in  the  investigator’s  clinical  judgment)  male  and  female 
children 6 and 35 months of age at the time of the first vaccination.  
Study  D-PAN  H5N1-032  enrolled  healthy  (in  the  investigator’s  clinical  judgment)  male  and  female 
children 3 to 17 years of age (inclusive) at the time of the first vaccination. Lactating female subjects 
and  of  childbearing  potential  that  lack  a  history  of  reliable  contraceptive  practices  (as  defined  by  the 
protocol) and pregnant women were excluded from the study. 
The main exclusion criteria were:  
•  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study 
vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during 
the study period. 
• 
Planned  administration  of  any  vaccine  30  days  prior  and  21  days  after  any  study  vaccine 
administration. 
•  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the 
vaccines such as egg protein or thiomersal.  
•  Any  confirmed  or  suspected  immunosuppressive  or  immunodeficient  condition,  based  on 
medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). 
•  History of any neurological disorders or seizures. 
•  Acute disease at the time of enrolment. 
• 
Previous vaccination at any time with an H5N1 vaccine. 
•  Medical history of physician-confirmed infection with a H5N1 virus 
Treatments 
In Study D-PAN H5N1-013 subjects received D-PAN H5N1 vaccine, containing A/Indonesia HA antigen 
and  AS03B,  on  Day  0  and  21  and  a  heterologous  booster  vaccination,  containing  A/turkey/Turkey  HA 
antigen and AS03B, on Day 182. Blood samples for humoral immune response, including neutralization 
antibodies were collected at Days 0, 42, 182, 192 and 364 for all subjects. 
In Study D-PAN H5N1-032 subjects were randomized to 3:3:2:2 to the following 4 treatment groups:

Recommended posology by the MAH was 2 doses of Adjupanrix containing 1.9 µg HA antigen and AS03B 
given at least 3 weeks apart for all children aged 6 months to <18 years. 
This is consistent with the treatment during study D-PAN H5N1-013 and the treatment in groups H5N1-
H5N1  and  H5N1-Havrix  in  study  D-PAN  H5N1-032.  Havrix  is  a  hepatitis  A  vaccine  and  used  as  a 
comparator in the study D-PAN H5N1-032. Use of an active comparator is appreciated.   
Comparing groups H5N1-H5N1 and H5N1-Havrix allows the assessment of the effect of a heterologous 
booster  dose  at  6  months  after  the  primary  vaccination.  Comparing  groups  H5N1-H5N1  and  Havrix-
H5N1 allows the assessment of the effect of the primary vaccination on the heterologous booster dose. 
Objectives and Outcomes/endpoints 
Study D-PAN H5N1-013 
Primary objective was to assess whether a heterologous booster dose of 1.9 μg A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 
(H5N1)  HA  with  AS03B  given  6  months  following  a  2-dose  primary  vaccination  series  with  1.9  μg 
A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) HA with AS03B elicits an antibody response that meets the SCR of >40%, 
SPR  of  >70%  and  MGI  of  >2.5  based  on  HI  responses  to  A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005  (H5N1)  10  days 
following booster vaccination.  
Secondary  objectives  were:  1)  to  assess  of  HI  and  neutralizing  antibody  responses  against 
A/Indonesia/05/2005  and  A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005  strains,  on  Day  0,  Day  42  (for  HI  only 
A/Indonesia/05/2005  H5N1  strain)  ,  Day  182,  Day  192,  and  Day  364.  On  Day  42  only  HI  antibody 
responses against the was tested; 2) to describe the humoral immune response in terms of the 3 age 
strata (6–11 Mo, 12–23 Mo and 24-35 Mo) used for enrolment in this study. 
The  following  immunogenicity  endpoints  were  analysed:  H5N1  HI  and  MN  antibody  titres  against 
A/Indonesia and A/Turkey virus strains at Days 0, 42*, 182, 192 and 364 (*only A/Indonesia strain for 
HI). The following derived variables were computed: 
-  GMT (HI and MN), seropositivity rate (HI and MN) and SPR (HI) of H5N1 antibody titres, at Days 
0, 42 (only for A/Indonesia strain), 182, 192 and 364. 
-  SCR (HI) and mean geometric increase (MGI) (HI) at Days 42 (only for A/Indonesia), 182, 192 
and 364. 
-  Booster Factor (BF) and Booster SCR (HI), and Booster VRR (MN; percentage of subjects with 
4-fold increase in post-booster vaccination titre relative to pre-booster [Day 182]) at Days 192 
and 364 (only A/Turkey strain). 
Study D-PAN H5N1-032 
Primary  objective  was 
to  assess 
the  superiority  of 
the  HI  antibody  response  against 
A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005  (H5N1)  10  days  following  H5N1  vaccination  on  Day  182  (1.9  μg 
A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 [H5N1] HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03B) in subjects previously primed with 
two  doses  of  heterologous  A/Indonesia/5/2005  (H5N1)  vaccine  versus  non  primed  subjects.  Criterion 
used: lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the HI GMT ratio on Day 192 (Group 
H5N1_H5N1 compared to Group Havrix_H5N1) was greater than 1.0.  
Secondary objectives were: 1) to assess the HI antibody response in terms of seropositivity rates, GMTs, 
SCR  (based  on  Day  0),  SPR  and  MGI  (based  on  Day  0),  against  A/Indonesia/5/2005  and 
A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005  (H5N1)  strains  on  Days  0,  42  and  182  (all  subjects),  on  Day  192  (Groups 
H5N1_H5N1  and  Havrix_H5N1)  [and  on  Day  364  (Groups  H5N1_H5N1,  H5N1_Havrix  and 
Havrix_H5N1)];  2)  to  describe  the  humoral  immune  response  in  terms  of  the  age  strata  used  for

enrollment  in  this  study;  and  3)  to  describe  the  H5N1  neutralizing  antibody  responses  against 
A/Indonesia/5/2005 and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 strains on Days 0, 42, 182 (all subjects), on Day 192 
(Groups  H5N1_H5N1  and  Havrix_H5N1)  and  on  Day  364  (Groups  H5N1_H5N1,  H5N1_Havrix  and 
Havrix_H5N1). 
The primary outcome variable was the humoral immune response in terms of H5N1 HI antibodies against 
the A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (H5N1) strain on Day 192. The following derived variables were computed: 
-  GMTs of H5N1 HI antibody titres on Day 192. 
-  GMT ratio on Day 192 of Group H5N1_H5N1 over Group Havrix_H5N1. 
The  following  secondary  outcome  variables  were  analysed:  H5N1  HI  and  MN  antibody  titres  against 
A/Indonesia and A/Turkey virus strains at Days 0, 42, 182 (all subjects), 192 (Groups H5N1_H5N1 and 
Havrix_H5N1)  and  on  Day  364  (Groups  H5N1_H5N1,  H5N1_Havrix  and  Havrix_H5N1).  The  following 
derived variables were computed: 
-  GMTs (HI and MN) and seropositivity rates (HI and MN) of H5N1 antibody titres, at Days 0, 42, 
182, 192 and 364. 
-  SCR (HI) and VRR (MN) on Days 42, 182, 192 and 364. 
-  SPR on Days 0, 42, 182, 192 and 364. 
-  MGI (HI) at Days 42, 182, 192 and 364. 
-  BF and Booster SCR (HI), and Booster VRR (MN) at Days 192 and 364. 
The Guideline on Influenza Vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) states: “The HI titre of 1:40 was 
previously suggested to represent a reasonable statistical correlate for an efficacy of 50–70% against 
clinical symptoms of influenza based on challenge studies in healthy adults. Since then, evidence has 
emerged to indicate that there remains a need to better define correlates of protection against influenza, 
which potentially may vary according to individual characteristics, populations, specific age group (e.g. 
paediatric population) and vaccine type.” 
No correlate of protection exists for Influenza. This hampered the interpretation of the clinical relevance 
of the observed vaccine-induced immunogenicity. Assessment was based on totality of immunogenicity 
findings based on all relevant parameters. Totality of all immunogenicity results should be sufficiently 
convincing to ensure CHMP that the candidate vaccine is likely to be efficacious in the event of a pandemic 
regardless of a statistically significant effect.  
The MAH expressed the seroprotection rate (SPR) as the percentage of subjects with a HI titre >1:40. 
As there is no clear clinical relevance of this cut-off, and as the percentages are closely reflected by the 
seroconversion rates (SCR), the focus of assessment has been based on the SCR next to GMTs, which 
were defined as the primary outcome. 
Sample size 
D-PAN H5N1-013 
The target sample size was approximately 120 subjects 6 to 35 months of age (6-11, 12-23 and 24-35 
months  with  a  ratio  2:1:1)  in  order  to  reach  108  evaluable  subjects,  assuming  that  10%  of  subjects 
(drop-out) were non-evaluable.

The study planned to enroll 520 eligible subjects with a randomization ratio of 3:3:2:2 in order to reach 
500 evaluable subjects, assuming that 4% of subjects (dropout) would be non-evaluable on Day 192. 
The  first  co-primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  the  HI  antibody 
response  against  A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005  (H5N1)  10  days  following  an  heterologous  H5N1  booster 
vaccination on Day 182 (1.9 μg A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03B) in subjects 
previously primed with two doses of A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 vaccine (Group H5N1_H5N1) versus non 
primed  subjects  (Group  Havrix_H5N1).  Using  data  from  recipients  of  the  D-PAN-H5N1-009  study,  a 
standard deviation of 0.52 was obtained for log10 HI titre specific for an H5N1 antigen on Day 42 based 
on the 1.9 μg antigen dose with AS03B in children. A sample of 150 subjects in Group H5N1_H5N1 and 
100 subjects in Group Havrix_H5N1 had 99.4% power to detect a two-fold increase in the H5N1 antibody 
response  between  the  two  groups  H5N1_H5N1  and  Havrix_H5N1,  assuming  the  common  deviation  is 
0.52 (in log unit) and using a one-sided two-group t-test with a 0.025 significance level. 
For the second co-primary objective: 
-  With 300 evaluable subjects in the H5N1 study vaccine groups, there was at least a probability 
of 91.0% to detect one AE with an occurrence rate of 0.8%. 
-  With 200 evaluable subjects in the control groups, there was at least a probability of 79.9% to 
detect one AE with an occurrence rate of 0.8%.  
Study D-PAN H5N1-013 was a descriptive study and not designed to test statistical hypothesis. The main 
driver was to contribute to the overall immunogenicity and safety database.   
The  main  driver  for  the  sample  size  for  study  D-PAN  H5N1-032  was  to  demonstrate  superiority  HI 
antibody response against A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (H5N1) 10 days following an heterologous H5N1 
booster vaccination on Day 182 (1.9 μg A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03B) 
in subjects previously primed with two doses of A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 vaccine (Group H5N1_H5N1) 
versus non primed subjects (Group Havrix_H5N1).  
Based on the fact that study D-PAN H5N1-009 enrolled healthy participants aged 3-9 years of age, the 
assumption that immune response was similar between the studies was questioned, as this study also 
enrolled  adolescents.  Younger  children  are  known  to  have  a  higher  immune  response  to  this  type  of 
adjuvanted vaccine. However, as there is neither an established threshold value associated with clinical 
benefit,  nor  a  good  knowledge  on  the  impact  of  inducing  a  lower-than-average  antibody  response, 
interpretation of meeting or not meeting any pre-specified acceptance criteria was considered difficult. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
PAN H5N1-013 
The study was non-randomized. The treatment allocation at the investigator site was performed using a 
central randomization system on internet (SBIR). The treatment numbers were allocated by dose. The 
randomization algorithm used a minimization procedure accounting for centre and age (6 to 11 months, 
12 to 23 months and 24 to 35 months). Centre and age minimization factors had equal weight in the 
minimization algorithm. 
The  enrolment  was  to  be  performed  to  ensure  a  distribution  with  the  ratio  of  2:1:1  of  the  three  age 
strata (6 to 11 months, 12 to 23 months and 24 to 35 months). 
The study was open label, no blinding was performed.

D-PAN H5N1-032 
Subjects were randomly assigned to four study groups in a 3:3:2:2 ratio. Subject numbers were assigned 
sequentially to subjects consenting to participate in the study, according to the range of subject numbers 
allocated to each study centre. 
The treatment allocation at the investigator site was performed using a central randomization system on 
internet (SBIR). The treatment numbers were allocated by dose. The randomization algorithm used a 
minimization  procedure  accounting  for  center  and  age  (3  to  9  years  old  versus  10  to  17  year  old). 
Minimization factors had equal weight in the minimization algorithm 
The enrolment was performed to ensure at least 40% of the subjects were included in each of the two 
age strata in every group (3 to 9 years old versus 10 to 17 years old). 
The  study  was  open  label,  no  blinding  was  performed.  Randomization  and  blinding  was  considered 
acceptable.  
Study  D-PAN  H5N1-013  was  a  phase  II  descriptive  study,  adding  to  the  immunogenicity  and  safety 
database.  
For study D-PAN H5N1-032 randomisation was stratified for age and ensured that in every group at least 
40% of subjects were included in each of the two age strata (3-9 years and 10-17 years). Randomisation 
was skewed to include slightly more participants in the H5N1-H5N1 and H5N1-Havrix groups compared 
to the Havrix-H5N1 and Havrix-Havrix groups, which was endorsed. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The total vaccinated cohort (TVC) included all vaccinated subjects (i.e., subjects who received at least 
one dose of vaccine in the studies) for whom data were available. The TVC analysis of immunogenicity 
included  vaccinated  subjects  for  whom  data  concerning  immunogenicity  endpoint  measures  were 
available. The TVC analysis was performed per vaccine actually administered at the first dose. 
The according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of immunogenicity included all subjects for whom HI 
assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine strain 21 days after primary 
vaccination [Day 42 (priming)], 10 days after booster vaccination [Month 6 (booster)] and 12 months 
after primary vaccination [Month 12 (persistence)]. 
Statistical methods 
For all studies, the primary analysis was based on the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity. Since 
the percentage of vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort was more 
than 5%, a second analysis based on the TVC was performed to complement the ATP analysis. 
A seronegative subject was a subject whose titre was below the cut-off value. A seropositive subject was 
a subject whose titre was greater than or equal to the cut off value. 
SCR was defined as the percentage of vaccinees that had either a pre-vaccination (Day 0) titre <1:10 
and a post-vaccination titre ≥1:40 or a pre-vaccination titre ≥1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in 
post-vaccination titre.  
SPR was defined as the percentage of vaccinees with a serum H5N1 HI antibody titre ≥1:40, that usually 
was accepted as indicating protection. 
Assessment report  
Page 34/35 
 
 
  
 
MGI was defined as the geometric mean of the within-subject ratios of the post-vaccination reciprocal 
HI titre to the pre-vaccination (Day 0) reciprocal HI titre. 
The GMT calculations are performed by taking the anti-log of the mean of the log titre transformations. 
Antibody  titres  below  the  cut-off  of  the  assay  are  given  an  arbitrary  value  of  half  the  cut-off  for  the 
purpose of GMT calculation. 
Booster SCR: For seronegative subjects at pre-booster (Day 182), antibody titre ≥1:40 at post-booster 
timepoint(s).  For  seropositive  subjects  at  pre-booster  (Day  182),  antibody  titre  at  post-booster 
timepoint(s) ≥4-fold the pre-booster antibody titre. 
BF  was  defined  as  the  geometric  mean  of  the  within-subject  ratios  of  the  post-booster  vaccination 
reciprocal HI titre to the pre-booster (Day 182) reciprocal titre. 
In D-Pan H5N1-013 study: 
VRR was defined as the percentage of vaccinees with at least a 4-fold increase in postvaccination titre 
relative to Day 0 (for MN antibodies). 
Booster VRR was defined as the percentage of vaccinees with at least a 4-fold increase in post-booster 
vaccination titre relative to pre-booster (Day 182) (for MN antibodies). 
In D-Pan H5N1-032 study: 
VRR was defined as the percentage of vaccinees that had either a pre-vaccination (Day 0) titre <1:28 
and  a  post-vaccination  titre  ≥1:56,  or  a  pre-vaccination  titre  ≥1:28  and  at  least  a  4-fold  increase  in 
post-vaccination titre (for MN antibodies). 
Booster VRR is defined as the percentage of vaccinees that have either a pre-booster (Day 182) titre 
<1:28  and  a  post-booster  titre  ≥1:56,  or  a  pre-booster  (Day  182)  titre  ≥1:28  and  at  least  a  4-fold 
increase in post-booster titre (for MN antibodies). 
Missing information 
For a given subject and a given immunogenicity measurement, missing or non-evaluable measurements 
were  not  replaced.  Therefore,  an  analysis  excluded  subjects  with  missing  or  non-evaluable 
measurements. 
Calculation CI 
All CIs were two-sided 95% CI. The exact 95% CIs for a proportion within a group was calculated from 
Proc StatXact (Clopper, 1934). The 95% CIs for GMT were obtained within each group separately. The 
95% CI for the mean of log-transformed titre was first obtained assuming that log-transformed titres 
were  normally  distributed  with  unknown  variance.  The  95%  CI  for  the  GMT  was  then  obtained  by 
exponential-transformation  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  mean  of  log-transformed  titre.  The  95%  CI  for  the 
adjusted  GMT  was  obtained  by  exponential-transformation  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  group  least  square 
mean of the used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.

Conduct of the study 
Study D-PAN H5N1-013 
Amendments 
There were 3 amendments to the original study protocol (dd. 07 December 2010). Amendment 1 (24 
January 2011) was executed to correct errors in vaccine tables where commas were left out in volumes 
and to clarify the contents of the vials and vaccine doses. Amendment 2 (16 June 2011) was written to 
exclude subjects who had had a past medical history of infection with a H5N1 virus or vaccination with 
a H5N1 vaccine. Amendment 3 (04 November 2011) was written as the age stratification ratio of 2:1:1 
for children 6 to 11 months, 12 to 23 months, and 24 to 35 months of age, respectively, was not to be 
maintained due to recruitment difficulties. The overall subject enrolment goal did not change. 
Other changes 
Compared to the protocol, an additional ATP cohort at Month 6 for kinetic analysis had been defined. 
Also the fever definition was adapted following the decision to harmonize the way fever is defined and 
reported for paediatric clinical trials (definition of fever changed from ≥37.5˚C to ≥38.0˚C). 
Protocol deviations 
One protocol violation, administration of vaccine(s) forbidden in the protocol, led to exclusion from the 
ATP safety cohort, see Table 12. In total, 27 participants (23.9%) had protocol deviations that led to 
exclusion  from  the  ATP  cohort  for  immunogenicity:  18 participants  (15.9%)  were  non-compliant  with 
blood  sampling  schedule  (including  wrong  and  unknown  dates),  13  participants  (11.5%)  were  non-
compliant with vaccination schedule (including wrong and unknown dates), 2 participants (1.8%) had 
essential serological data missing, 1 participant (0.9%) had a violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
as mentioned 1 (0.9%) participant had a forbidden vaccine administered.

(D-PAN H5N1-013) 
The ATP cohort at Month 12 is presented in Table 13. One protocol violation, administration of vaccine(s) 
forbidden  in  the  protocol,  led  to  exclusion  from  the  ATP  safety  cohort,  see  Table  13.  In  total,  13 
participants  (11.5%)  had  protocol  deviations  that  led  to  exclusion  from  the  ATP  cohort  for

and unknown dates), 7 participants (6.2%) had essential serological data missing, 1 participant (0.9%) 
had  a  violation  of  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  and  as  mentioned  1  (0.9%)  participant  had  a  forbidden 
vaccine administered.

Amendments 
There were no amendments to the original study protocol (dd. 02 December 2010). 
The statistical analysis was performed according to the SAP Amendment 1 dated 21 June 2012. Changes 
to the conduct of the study are summarized below: 
•  Compared to the protocol, an additional ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity at Month 6 
(booster) for kinetics analysis was defined. 
• 
The fever definition was adapted following the decision to harmonize the way fever is defined 
and reported in paediatric settings. 
•  A further specification as to how the analyses on concomitant medication were performed was 
given in Section 5.9.9. 
•  Although the study was originally planned as a multi-center study, the study was carried out as 
a single-center study due to logistic issues. 
•  A post hoc analysis was performed to include data on unsolicited adverse events (Day 0 to Day 
42) pooling groups according to their primary schedule and also to support a two dose priming 
schedule for regulatory submission. 
Protocol deviations

Five protocol violation, administration of vaccine(s) forbidden in the protocol, led to exclusion from the 
ATP safety cohort, see Table 14.  
In  total,  9  participants  (1.7%)  had  protocol  deviations  that  led  to  exclusion  from  the  ATP  cohort  for 
immunogenicity  at  Day  42:  4 participants  (0.8%)  had  essential  serological  data  missing,  and  5 
participants (1.0%) had a forbidden vaccine administered.  
In total, 56 participants (10.8%) had protocol deviations that led to exclusion from the ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity at Month 6: 48 participants (9.2%) were non-compliant with blood sampling schedule 
(including wrong and unknown dates), 4 participants (0.8%) had essential serological data missing, and 
5 participants (1.0%) had a forbidden vaccine administered. 
In total, 19  participants (3.7%) had  protocol deviations that led to exclusion from the ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity  at  Month  12:  13  participants  (2.5%)  had  essential  serological  data  missing,  and  7 
participants (1.3%) had a forbidden vaccine administered.

The study conduct was overall acceptable for both studies.  
The change in fever definition, from ≥37.5˚C to ≥38.0˚C, was endorsed. 
For study D-PAN H5N1-013 it was understood that due to recruitment difficulties age stratification ratio 
of 2:1:1 for children 6-11 months, 12-23 months and 24-35 months of age was not maintained. This 
could be accepted as overall subject enrolment goal was maintained. From immunogenicity standpoint

children aged 6 months to 2 years of age were considered comparable. As amendment 2 was executed 
after study enrolment had started, the MAH was asked to determine how many participants entered the 
study that had a history of either H5N1 disease or vaccination. None of the participants enrolled had a 
history of either H5N1 disease or H5N1 vaccination. 
The MAH comprehensively monitored the protocol deviations during study D-PAN H5N1-013. Important 
protocol  deviations  leading  to  exclusion  from  ATP  cohort  were  reported  by  at  most  27  participants 
(23.9%)  during the study, most of which were  deviations in trial procedures, with non-compliance to 
blood  sampling  schedule  (15.9%)  and  vaccination  schedule  (11.5%).  The  maximum  percentage  of 
clinically  important  protocol  deviations  were  relatively  high,  leading  to  an  exclusion  rate  of  23.9%. 
However, this could be expected with these young children. 
For study D-PAN H5N1-032, important protocol deviations leading to exclusion from ATP cohort at Day 
42 were reported by in total 9 participants (1.7%) during the study, which included missing essential 
serology  data  and  administration  of  vaccines  forbidden  in  the  study  protocol.  Important  protocol 
deviations  leading  to  exclusion  from  ATP  cohort  at  Month 6  were  reported  by  in  total  56  participants 
(10.8%) during the study, most of which were non-compliance to blood sampling schedule (9.2%).  
Baseline data 
D-PAN H5N1-013 
Study  D-PAN  H5N1-013  included  healthy  children  6  and  35  months  of  age  at  the  time  of  the  first 
vaccination. The baseline demographic data of the study is shown in Table 16. 
Assessment report  
Page 41/42 
 
 
  
 
Table 15 Summary of demographic characteristics by age stratum – Total vaccinated cohort (D-PAN 
H5N1-013) 
The study included slightly more female than male participants. 
Off note, in the 24 to <36 months old category geographic ancestry was slightly different compared to 
the  other  groups,  with  a  smaller  proportion  of  Asian  -south  east  Asian  heritage  population  and  an 
increased Other population. 
D-PAN H5N1-032 
Study D-PAN H5N1-032 included healthy children 3 to 17 years of age (inclusive) at the time of the 
first  vaccination.  The  baseline  demographic  data  of  the  study  is  shown  in  Table  16.  The  baseline 
characteristics of the different ATP cohorts for immunogenicity do not differ substantially from the total 
vaccinated cohort.

Primary immunogenicity endpoint 
The  primary  immunogenicity  objective  of  assessing  whether  a  heterologous  booster  dose  of  1.9  μg 
A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005  (H5N1)  HA  with  AS03B  given  six  months  following  a  two-dose  primary 
vaccination series elicits an antibody response that meets the CHMP criteria was met as the following 
were fulfilled: 
• 
• 
• 
The point estimate for SCR was equal to 100% for all subjects (100% for 6M<12M, 100% for 
12M<24M, 100% for 24M<36M) (CHMP criterion >40%) see Table 22. 
The point estimate for SPR was equal to 100% for all subjects (100% for 6M<12M, 100% for 
12M<24M, 100% for 24M<36M) (CHMP criterion >70%).

The  primary  immunogenicity  objective  of  the  study  of  assessing  the  immune  response  after  a 
heterologous booster 6 months after the primary vaccination was met, as the point estimate for SCR 
was over 40%, 100% in all age stratums, the point estimate for SPR was >70% and the point estimate 
for MGI was >2.5 (>317 in all age stratums).  
Ten days after a booster with 1.9µg A/turkey HA +AS03B, a substantial immune response as measured 
by A/turkey HI parameters was seen, as reflected by a SCR of 100% and a MGI of >317.This indicates 
that in children primed with A/Indonesia, a booster with A/turkey 6 months after the primary vaccination, 
were  able  to  elicit  a  substantial  immune  response  to  the  booster.  In  a  real  world  setting  during  a 
pandemic, this would mean that up to 6 months after the primary vaccination the children would be able 
to elicit a robust immune response to an antigenically drifted strain. 
Secondary immunogenicity objectives 
The results for GMTs for HI antibodies against the A/Indonesia/05/2005 H5N1 virus strain on Day 0, Day 
42, Day 182 and Day 192 are detailed in Table 18. The results for GMTs for HI antibodies against the 
A/Indonesia/05/2005 H5N1 virus strain on Day 0, and Day 364 are detailed in Table 19.

The primary vaccination induced a robust increase in homologous HI antibodies, as in all age stratums 
a SCR of 100% was seen at D42. GMTs remained well above baseline for at least 6 months, as on D182 
in  all  age  stratums  a  SCR  of  ≥97%  was  observed.  Ten  days  after  a  booster  with  1.9µg  A/turkey  HA 
+AS03B, a substantial booster response in A/Indonesia HI parameters was seen, in that GMTs increased 
to 17887.6 (1552.4-2058.3), SCR was 100% and MGI was 357.5 (310.5-411.7) in the entire population. 
This indicates that an antigenically drifted strain (A/turkey) was able to elicit an anamnestic response 
for A/Indonesia antibodies that was higher compared to the primary response (as seen as GMTs at D42) 
at 6 months after the primary vaccination. Substantial cross-reactivity is seen in the immune response. 
Six  months  after  a  heterologous  booster  dose  (D364),  primary  vaccine  homologous  GMTs  declined, 
however, in all age stratums a SCR of 100% was seen. These results indicate that vaccine homologous 
HI antibody response was induced by the primary vaccination. The HI antibodies declined over time, but 
persisted for at least 6 months. A booster is able to increase GMTs above levels reached in the primary 
vaccination and antibodies persisted for at least 6 months after a booster. 
Six months after a boost with A/turkey, A/turkey HI antibody GMTs were still present well above baseline 
line levels, with a SCR of > 87% in all age stratums. These results show that a booster given 6 months 
after a primary vaccination is able to elicit HI antibodies that persist for at least 6 months after boost.

Neutralizing antibodies are functional antibodies. The primary vaccination induced a robust increase in 
homologous MN antibodies, as in all age stratums a VRR of 100% was seen at D42. GMTs remained well 
above baseline for at least 6 months, as on D182 in all age stratums a VRR of >95% was observed. Ten 
days after a heterologous boost, a significant increase in MN antibodies was observed which led to a VRR 
of 100% in all age stratums and GMTs were higher compared to the GMTs at D42. Six months after a 
heterologous  booster  dose  (D364),  primary  vaccine  homologous  GMTs  declined,  however,  in  all  age 
stratums a VRR of 100% was seen. These results indicate that vaccine homologous MN antibody response 
was induced by the primary vaccination. The MN antibodies decline over time, but persist for at least 6 
months.  A  booster  is  able  to  increase  GMTs  above  levels  reached  in  the  primary  vaccination  and 
antibodies persist for at least 6 months after a booster. 
Six months after a primary vaccination with A/Indonesia, A/turkey MN antibody GMTs were still present 
well above baseline line levels, with a VRR of > 78% in all age stratums. Ten days after a boost with 
A/turkey, a robust increase in GMTs was seen in all age stratums, leading to a VRR of 100%. VRR was 
100%  in  all  age  stratums  at  D364.  These  results  indicate  that  vaccine  heterologous  MN  antibody 
response was induced by the primary vaccination, which persisted for at least 6 months as prevaccination 
titers were lower compared to D182. A booster is able to increase GMTs leading to a VRR of 100%. This 
VRR persisted for at least 6 months after boost.

The primary immunogenicity objective was to assess the superiority of the HI antibody response against 
A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005  (H5N1)  10  days  following  H5N1  vaccination  on  Day  182  (1.9  μg 
A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (H5N1) HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03B) in subjects previously primed with 
two doses of heterologous A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) vaccine (Group H5N1_H5N1) versus non primed 
subjects (Group Havrix_H5N1). 
The  primary  immunogenicity  objective  was  met  as  the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  confidence 
interval  for  the  HI  GMT  ratio  on  Day  192  (Group  H5N1_H5N1  compared  to  Group  Havrix_H5N1)  was 
7.30, which is greater than 1.0, see Table 21. 
Table 21 Adjusted GMT ratios of HI antibodies post vaccination between group H5N1_H5N1 and group 
Havrix_H5N1 for A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 strain on Day 192 (Month 6 ATP cohort) (D-PAN H5N1-032) 
At D182 the H5N1/Turkey HI GMT was higher in the H5_H5 group (39.6 [35.8-43.8]) compared to the 
Hav_H5  group  (6.0  [5.5-6.5]).  At  D192,  10  days  after  booster  vaccination  with  H5N1/Turkey, 
H5N1/Turkey HI GMT was 737.6 (646.8-841.1) in the H5_H5 group vs 24.7 (19.7-31.0) in the Hav_H5 
group.  Both  groups  showed  an  increase  in  HI  GMT  after  the  booster  vaccination  with  H5N1/Turkey, 
however,  the  response  was  significantly  higher  in  the  H5_H5  group,  indicating  the  presence  of  an 
anamnestic  immune  response  to  an  antigenically  drifted  strain  after  primary  vaccination  with

GMT: geometric mean titre; MGI: mean geometric increase; SCR: seroconversion rate 
SCR is defined as: for initially seronegative subjects an antibody titre ≥40 1/DIL at postvaccination an antibody titre 
≥4-fold the prevaccination titre in initially seropositive subjects. 
N is the number of subjects with results available (GMT) 
N’ is the number of subjects with both pre- and postvaccination results available (SCR and MGI) 
*MGI is the mean GMT increase compared to Day 0. 
Pre-vaccination homologous HI GMT was comparably low (<6.0) between the groups, indicating that a 
H5N1 naïve population was selected. At D42, 21 days after primary vaccination with 1.9 µg A/Indonesia 
HA  +  AS03B,  a  significant  increase  in  homologous  HI  GMT  was  observed  in  both  H5_H5  and  H5_Hav 
groups  leading  to  an  >99%  SCR  (99.4%  and  99.3%  respectively)  and  >96  MGI  (96.9  and  108.4 
respectively). Groups Hav_H5 and Hav_Hav received Havrix or Havrix junior at D0 and as expected did 
not show an increase in A/Indonesia HI GMT at D42. These results indicate that the primary vaccination 
with H5N1 vaccine was able to elicit a robust immune response leading to an SCR of nearly 100% at 21 
days after vaccination. 
Homologous HI GMTs declined over time; they were lower at D182 as compared to D42 in groups H5_H5 
and H5_Hav. However, they remained well above baseline as SCR was >78% at D182 for both groups 
(78.7% and 79.6% respectively) and MGI was >9 (9.1 and 9.8 respectively). 
Ten days after a booster with 1.9 µg A/turkey HA +AS03B, group H5_H5 showed a substantial booster 
response in A/Indonesia HI parameters, in that GMTs increased to 674.1, SCR was 100% and MGI was 
117.7.  As  shown  above,  an  antigenically  drifted  strain  (A/turkey)  was  able  to  elicit  an  anamnestic 
response  for  A/Indonesia  antibodies  that  was  higher  compared  to  the  primary  response  at  6  months 
after the primary vaccination. In group without primary vaccination series, Hav_H5, 10 days after the 
heterologous booster dose A/Indonesia  GMTs, SCR and MGI increased only slightly. 
Pre-vaccination heterologous HI GMT was comparably low (<7.5) between the groups, indicating that a 
H5N1 naïve population was selected. At D42, 21 days after primary vaccination with 1.9µg A/Indonesia 
HA +AS03B, a significant increase in A/turkey HI GMT was observed in both H5_H5 and H5_Hav groups 
leading to an >97% SCR (98.7% and 98.0% respectively) and >27 MGI (27.7 and 33.1 respectively). 
The increase in heterologous HI GMT was lower compared to homologous HI GMT, which is expected. 
Groups Hav_H5 and Hav_Hav received Havrix or Havrix junior at D0 and as expected did not show an 
increase  in  A/turkey  HI  GMT  at  D42.  These  results  indicate  that  the  primary  vaccination  with  H5N1

vaccine was able to elicit a robust heterologous immune response leading to an SCR of over 95% at 21 
days after vaccination. 
Heterologous HI GMTs declined over time; they were lower at D182 as compared to D42 in groups H5_H5 
and H5_Hav. However, they remained well above baseline. At D182 groups H5_H5 and H5_Hav groups 
had higher mean A/turkey HI GMTs  (39.6 and 42.5 respectively) compared to Hav_H5 and Hav_Hav 
groups (6.0 and 7.0 respectively). Ten days after a booster with 1.9µg A/turkey HA +AS03B, the H5_H5 
group showed a substantial booster response in A/turkey HI parameters, as GMTs increased to 737.6 
and  SCR was 100%. This indicates that a heterologous boost with A/turkey induces a substantial immune 
response  within  10  days  in  individuals  primed  with  A/Indonesia,  leading  to  an  SCR  of  100%.  In  the 
Hav_H5  group,  an  immune  response  was  seen  as  A/turkey  HI  GMTs  increased  to  24.7  from  6.0 
prevaccination, leading to an 32.1% SCR. These results indicate that priming substantially increases the 
immune response to a heterologous boost.  
The results for GMTs, SCR and MGI for HI antibodies against the A/Indonesia/05/2005 H5N1 virus strain 
and the A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 H5N1 virus strain on Day 0 and Day 364 for the Month 12 ATP cohort

At  D364,  6  months  after  booster  vaccination  with  A/turkey,  A/Indonesia  HI  parameters  were 
substantially increased compared to prevaccination, with a GMT of 205.5 compared to 5.7 and an SCR 
of 100% in the H5_H5 group. In the H5_Hav group, 1 year after primary vaccination, A/Indonesia HI

parameters  were  lower  compared  to  the  group  that  received  the  booster  with  A/turkey  (H5_H5), 
however, still higher compared to the prevaccination baseline, as SCR was 68.0% and MGI 7.4. These 
results indicate that the heterologous booster is able to induce an anamnestic immune response to an 
antigenically different strain that persists for at least 6 months in primed individuals.  
In the group that was unprimed and only received a single dose of A/turkey containing vaccine (Hav_H5), 
A/Indonesia HI parameters at 6 months after the dose were comparable to prevaccination parameters. 
This indicates that a primary vaccination is required before a single dose can induce lasting cross-reactive 
immune response. 
At D364, A/turkey HI parameters were substantially increased compared to D182 (prebooster), with a 
GMT of 215.1 compared to 38.5 and an SCR of 69.5% in the H5_H5 group. In the H5_Hav group, at 
D364  A/turkey  HI  parameters  slightly  lower  compared  to  D182,  35.4  vs  43.0.  This  indicates  that  the 
immune response declines over time. These results indicate that in primed individuals a heterologous 
booster is able to induce an immune response that declines over time, from 100% 10 days after boost 
to 69.5% 6 months later.  
In  unprimed  individuals,  a  single  dose  of  A/turkey,  leads  to  an  increase  in  GMTs  that  is  still  seen  6 
months after the dose: with an GMT of 18.4 (16.3-20.9) at D364 compared to 6.1 (5.6-6.6) at D182, 
leading to an SCR of 18.0% and MGI of 3.0. A single dose of vaccine is able to induce a response that 
persists for 6 months, however, the response is substantially higher in individuals primed with a primary 
vaccination.

MN is a functional assay, measuring virus neutralizing antibodies. The results of this analysis are in line 
with the results for the HI analysis. 
At D42, 21 days after the primary vaccination series, a significant increase in homologous MN GMT was 
observed in both H5_H5 and H5_Hav groups leading to an >98% VRR (98.7% and 98.7% respectively). 
Groups  Hav_H5  and  Hav_Hav  did  not  show  an  increase  in  A/Indonesia  MN  GMT  at  D42.  As  with  HI 
antibodies, MN GMTs declined over time; they were lower at D182 as compared to D42 in groups H5_H5 
and H5_Hav. However, they remained well above baseline as VRR was >79% at D182 for both groups 
(85.7% and 79.7% respectively).  
Ten  days  after  a  heterologous  booster  with  1.9µg  A/turkey  HA  +AS03B,  group  H5_H5  showed  a 
substantial booster response in A/Indonesia MN parameters, in that GMTs increased to 2088.0 and VRR 
was 100%. As shown above, an antigenically drifted strain (A/turkey) was able to elicit an anamnestic 
response  for  A/Indonesia  antibodies  that  was  higher  compared  to  the  primary  response  at  6  months 
after the primary vaccination. In the group without primary vaccination series, Hav_H5, 10 days after 
the  heterologous  booster  dose  A/Indonesia    GMTs  and  VRR  increased  only  slightly  (38.2  and  5.0% 
respectively). 
Results  for  heterologous  antibodies  are  in  line  with  the  homologous  MN  antibodies.  After  primary 
vaccination, a substantial increase in MN GMT for A/turkey are observed in both groups receiving the 
primary vaccination, leading to an MGI of approximately 10 fold. Ten days after a heterologous booster, 
VRR increased to 94.2% in the H5_H5 group, compared to 37.5% in the Hav_H5 group. This response 
decreased over time in the H5_H5 group, with VRR being 56.9% 6 months after the booster dose.  
Ancillary analyses 
Study D-PAN H5N1-013 
GMTs  were  comparable  across  both  sexes  and  age  sub-groups,  see  Table  26  .  The  GMT  for  the 
A/Indonesia strain peaked at Day 42 and remained well above baseline through Day 182 for both sexes 
across  all  age  sub-groups.  After  the  booster  dose  of  A/Turkey  at  Day  182,  GMT  peaked  at  Day  192. 
GMTs  consistently  remained  well  above  baseline  through  Day  364  for  both  sexes  across  all  age  sub-
groups. There was a significant increase in GMT for the A/Turkey strain at Day 192. GMT remained well 
above baseline through Day 364 for both sexes across all age sub-groups.

Study D-PAN H5N1-032 
The results for GMTs of HI antibodies against the A/Indonesia strain at Day 0, Day 42, Day 182 were 
comparable by sex and age sub-groups (3-9 years and 10-17 years) in the H5_H5 and H5_HAV study 
groups, see Table 27. Boosting with A/Turkey on Day 182 elicited strong GMTs of HI antibodies against 
A/Turkey on Day 192 in the H5_H5 group with comparable data by sex and age strata.

Study Q-PAN H5N1-023 
The antibody geometric mean titres (GMTs) were comparable across all age sub-groups for both sexes, 
see Table 28. High GMTs were observed at Day 42 (both sexes across all age sub-groups) for homologous 
and heterologous strains. The vaccine-homologous and heterologous HI antibody titres declined for all 
formulations  at  Day  385  (both  sexes  across  all  age  sub-groups).  Day  392  elicited  strong  immune 
response with GMTs raising well above Day 385 (both sexes across all age sub-groups).

No trends were observed with respect to immunogenicity and gender. It appears that younger subjects 
had  higher  immune  responses.  However,  as  numbers  are  small  in  the  different  subgroups,  no  strong 
conclusions could be drawn. 
Summary of main studies 
The following tables summarise the immunogenicity results from the main studies supporting the 
present application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical 
immunogenicity as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

The usefulness of this  immunogenicity-fever-index for both the HI  as well as  the MN 
antibodies is limited. The totality of all immunogenicity and safety results was evaluated 
to determine which dose is considered appropriate for children and was based on the

Clinical studies in special populations 
Healthy children were included in all studies. No special populations were investigated. 
Supportive study 
Study Design: Study Q-PAN H5N1-021 was a Phase 2/3, randomized, controlled, observer-blind, multi-
centre  trial  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  a  two-dose  primary  vaccination  series  of 
monovalent  A/Indonesia/5/2005  (H5N1)  vaccine  antigen  adjuvanted  with  AS03  in  children  aged  6 
months to <18 years of age.  
Treatment:  Participants  in  Study  Q-PAN  H5N1-021  were  randomized  in  a  8:3  ratio  to  receive  a  two 
doses of either Q-Pan H5N1 adjuvanted with AS03B vaccine or placebo on days 0 and 21 in Year 1. Each 
Year 1 placebo recipient who remained eligible and elected to receive the Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine after data 
lock for Study Day 385 was to be asked to participate in Study Year 2 for an additional 385 days, in 
which participants received two doses of Q-Pan H5N1 adjuvanted with AS03B vaccine on days 0 and 21. 
Study Participants: The study population will consist of healthy males or females ≥6 months and <18 
years of age at the time of first vaccination in study year 1, without prior administration of any H5N1 
vaccine. In total 838 subjects were enrolled. 
In the Q-Pan group, 607 participants were randomized and vaccinated with Q-Pan H5N1. In total, 565 
(93.1%)  completed  and  42  (6.9%)  discontinued  from  the  study.  In  the  year  1  placebo  group,  231 
participants were randomized and treated with placebo. In total, 217 (93.9%) completed and 14 (6.1%) 
discontinued from the study. In year 2, 155 subjects were vaccinated, 152 (98.1%) completed and 3 
(1.9%) discontinued the study. 
Demographic characteristics, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity, were presented descriptively. 
Demographic characteristics were generally comparable for vaccinated participants across intervention 
groups, although slightly more males were included in the Q-PAN group compared to the Placebo group. 
No inferential statistics were planned. 
Objectives: The primary objective of the study, evaluated in Year 1, was to assess whether 2 doses of 
H5N1  antigen  in  association  with  AS03  elicited  an  immune  response,  measured  by  postimmunisation 
vaccine-homologous  virus  HI  titres,  that  met  or  exceeded  the  Center  for  Biologics  Evaluation  and 
Research  (CBER)/CHMP  young  adult  targets  for  proportion  of  subjects  attaining  post-immunisation 
reciprocal HI titres ≥40 (SPR) against A/Indonesia virus. 
The secondary objectives of the study were 1) describe at different time points the immunogenicity of 
the vaccine regimen in the 3 age strata in terms of HI titers specific for the vaccine-homologous virus 
using the following parameters: seropositivity rate, geometric mean titer (GMT), SCR, SPR, and mean 
geometric increase (MGI) in terms of point estimates and 95%  confidence interval (CI), 2) to further 
describe the immunogenicity of the vaccine regimen in the 3 age strata in terms of microneutralization 
(MN) titers specific for the vaccine homologous virus and for one or more drift-variant viruses. 
Results:  
Primary Endpoints 
The primary objective was met. At Day 42, the lower 98.3% CI was greater than 70% for the vaccine-

In the Q-PAN group vaccine-homologous HI titers reached a peak at Day 42, 21 days after the primary 
vaccination  series,  leading  to  an  SCR  of  99.5%  (98.4-100)  and  MGI  of  99.6  (92.6-107.1).    After  the 
peak the HI antibodies declined over time, however remained well above baseline until at least 1 year 
after the primary vaccination series, as seen by an SCR of 50.0% (43.5-56.5) and MGI of 5.8 (5.1-6.4). 
The response HI antibody response was highest in the youngest age category. In the Placebo group no 
significant increase in HI titers were observed. 
The vaccine-homologous MN antibody titers developed identically compared to the HI titers, in that a 
peak was reached at Day 42 after which a decline in titer starts. Vaccine-homologous titers remain well 
above baseline for at least 1 year after primary vaccination in all age categories (MGI of >5). For the 
vaccine-homologous MN response, the response was again highest in the youngest age category.  
The response for vaccine-heterologous MN antibody titers develop similarly  compared to the vaccine-
homologous MN titers, though to a considerably lesser extent. The peak GMT in the entire population 
was 68.07 (62.73-73.86) compared to 585.33 (476.83-718.53). Again after the peak titers decline, but 
remain above baseline for at least 1 year. However, no effect of age could be observed.  
Supportive evidence from an H1N1-based vaccine 
In a meta-analysis, data were analysed from 38 studies including a total of 7 643 738 adults (≥18 
years of age and ≥50 years of age) vaccinated with inactivated adjuvanted or unadjuvanted 
monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccine or placebo or not vaccinated (Lansbury, 2017). This meta-analysis 
included data from effectiveness studies of the AS03 adjuvanted Q Pan H1N1 vaccine Arepanrix and 
the D-Pan H1N1 AS03 adjuvanted vaccine Pandemrix. 
Vaccine effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed influenza 14 days after vaccination compared with 
non-vaccinated subjects of all ages revealed a pooled VE point estimate of 80% for adjuvanted H1N1 
vaccines (95% CI 59‒90%; p<0.00001) compared with non-vaccinated individuals. In children (<18 
years of age), vaccine effectiveness was 88% (95% CI 69‒95%; p<0.0001) for adjuvanted H1N1 
vaccines and 45% (95% CI 13‒73; p=0.83) for unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccines (Figure 3).

Adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines were significantly more effective at preventing hospitalisation for influenza 
in children within 14 days of vaccination (85%, 95% CI 67‒94; p<0.00001) than in adults (p=0.04). 
Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of Pandemrix and Arepanrix at the national or 
regional level in different countries using different methodologies (Table 1).

Prospective efficacy study of an AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine 
In a Phase III observer blind study conducted during 2010‒2011 in 17 centres in Australia, Brazil, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, 6 145 children (6 months to10 
years of age) were randomised to receive a single dose of AS03-adjuvanted Q-Pan H1N1 vaccine 
(A/California; Day 0) followed by placebo on Day 21, two doses of AS03-adjuvanted Q-Pan H1N1 
vaccine (Day 0, 21) or two doses of unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of 2 doses of H1N1-AS03 relative to that of 2 doses 
of nonadjuvanted vaccine beginning 14 days after dose 1 and continuing until study conclusion on day 
385. Noninferiority in terms of relative vaccine efficacy (VE) was concluded if the lower limit of the 
95% confidence interval (CI) for relative VE against real-time PCR–confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection 
(Ad2 vs NAd2) was >-33%. Superiority was concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI for relative VE 
was >0. 
The relative efficacy of two doses of AS03-adjuvanted Q-Pan H1N1 vaccine compared with two doses 
of unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine for the prevention of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-
confirmed pandemic H1N1 infection from days 14 to 385 after vaccination was 76.8% (95% CI 18.5–
93.4), which met predefined non-inferiority and superiority criteria for the adjuvanted vaccine. The 
efficacy of two doses of AS03-adjuvanted Q-Pan H1N1 vaccine was also non-inferior to that of two 
doses of unadjuvanted vaccine for the prevention of culture-confirmed influenza in all subjects (days 
14–385; relative efficacy 74.9% 95% CI -18.2‒94.7) and the prevention of real time PCR–confirmed 
pandemic H1N1 infection in children 3 to 9 years of age (relative efficacy 77.5% 95% CI -4.0‒95.2) . 
The CHMP criteria were met in all treatment groups on Day 42, including in the subgroups 6‒35 
months of age and 3‒10 years of age (Nolan et al. Journal of Infectious Disease 2014). 
The meta-analysis by Lansbury showed that vaccine effectiveness of adjuvanted H1N1 influenza vaccines 
was  88%  in  children  during  the  2009-2010  pandemic.  Adjuvanted  H1N1  influenza  vaccines  were 
observed to be more effective compared to unadjuvanted H1N1 influenza vaccines during the pandemic. 
This provides confirmation that use of adjuvanted influenza vaccines during a pandemic is appropriate. 
Table 35 indicates that efficacy of Pandemrix and Arepanrix vary with location and age, however, vaccine 
efficacy in children was found to be ≥62%. 
The study by Nolan et al. (Journal of Infectious Disease 2014) investigated VE of 1 or 2 doses of AS03-
adjuvanted Q-Pan H1N1 vaccine (A/California) compared to 2 doses of nonadjuvanted influenza A(H1N1) 
vaccine  (A/California)  in  children  aged  6  months  to  <10  years.  This  randomized,  observer-blind, 
controlled study was conducted during 2010–2011. In total, 5803 children were included in ATP time-
to-event  efficacy  analysis  (days  14–385),  of  which  23  had  real-time  PCR-confirmed  A(H1N1)pdm09 
infection.  The  efficacy  of  the  adjuvanted  versus  the  unadjuvanted  vaccine  for  prevention  of  PCR-
confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection from days 14 to 385 was 76.8% (95% CI, 18.5%–93.4%). 
These data further confirm that it is reasonable to expect that an AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine would 
provide protection against the influenza strain contained in the vaccine during a pandemic.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Adjupanrix  is  a  split  virion,  inactivated,  AS03-adjuvanted  H5N1  pandemic  influenza  vaccine.  It  is 
currently intended for prophylaxis of influenza in the case of an officially declared pandemic. The MAH 
proposed to extend the indication to include use in children from 6 months to <18 years. Since this MA 
Assessment report  
Page 65/66 
 
 
  
 
 
 
is not effective (no indication) before the authorisation of the 'pandemic variation', it was proposed at 
the  time  of  the  MAA  to  allow  the  submission  of  different  scenarios  in  the  MA  dossier  (core  pandemic 
dossier) of the 'mock-up' vaccine and select the relevant scenario at the time of the submission of the 
'pandemic  variation'.  Vaccines  registered  through  the  'mock-up'  vaccine  procedure  prior  the 
authorisation  of  a  'pandemic'  variation  are  not  indicated  in  a  prepandemic  setting  (the  indication  has 
been  restricted  to  the  use  during  a  pandemic  phase).  The  guideline  on  submission  and  procedural 
requirement  for  influenza  vaccines  (EMA/56793/2014)  states:  “When  a  pandemic  situation  is  duly 
recognised by the WHO or the Union, the MAH should submit a variation application (‘pandemic strain 
update’) as per Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 to include the declared pandemic strain in 
the pandemic vaccine (‘pandemic strain update’). This variation will be reviewed under an accelerated 
timeframe.”  Therefore,  the  indication  4.1  should  not  be  amended.  In  addition,  ethical  considerations 
limit investigations that can be done in very young infants using a mock-up vaccine that will never be 
used and is thus not of use for them. 
Nonetheless,  the  application  remained  of  interest  as  the  procedure  has  been  used  to  determine  the 
posology for children aged 6 months to <18 years in the SmPC of Adjupanrix. Of note, as a mock up 
vaccine, Adjupanrix will not be deployed as is, but in an officially declared pandemic, the pandemic strain 
will  be  included  in  the  vaccine.  Pandemrix,  a  H1N1  AS03B  adjuvanted  vaccine  is  a  pandemic  vaccine 
prepared using this platform. 
The overall objective of the clinical development program was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity 
of  Adjupanrix  administered  as  a  2-dose  regimen  in  children  aged  6  months  to  <18  years  of  age.  No 
efficacy or effectiveness data is available, which is acceptable as H5N1 does not circulate. During the 
2009/2010 pandemic caused by A(H1N1)pdm09, Pandemrix was effectively used, which shows that the 
GSK  platform  works.  The  MAH  provided  a  summary  of  effectiveness  information  obtained  using 
Pandemrix in children during the 2009/2010 pandemic, as well as data from a prospective efficacy study 
conducted in 2010/2011. The H1N1 adjuvanted vaccine was shown to be effective in children during the 
pandemic (VE ≥62%). During the study by Nolan et al, it was shown that an AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 
vaccine had superior efficacy compared to an unadjuvanted vaccine. While it is acknowledged that data 
for an H1N1-based vaccine is not directly applicable for the H5N1 construct, it is reassuring. It further 
confirms that it is reasonable to expect that an AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine would provide protection 
against the influenza strain contained in the vaccine during a pandemic. 
This application is based on immunogenicity data from 4 studies: 1 dose ranging study in children aged 
6  months  to  <36  months  (study  Q-PAN  H5N1-023),  a  phase  II  single  arm  study  in  children  aged  6 
months  to  35  months  (study  D-PAN  H5N1-013),  a  phase  III  randomized  active-controlled  study  in 
children aged 3 to 17 years (study D-PAN H5N1-032) and a supportive phase II/III placebo-controlled 
study in children aged 6 months to <18 years (study Q-PAN H5N1-021). No correlate of protection exists 
for Influenza. This hampers the interpretation of the clinical relevance of the observed vaccine-induced 
immunogenicity. Totality of all immunogenicity results should be sufficiently convincing to ensure CHMP 
of vaccine efficacy regardless of a statistically significant effect. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
With  the  approval  of  D-Pan  H5N1  products  by  the  European  Commission,  GSK  committed  to  conduct 
several paediatric studies using half the adult dose (containing 1.9 µg H5N1 HA antigen adjuvanted with 
AS03B [containing 5.93 mg of tocopherol]) as part of the initially agreed D-Pan H5N1 PIP (PIP-EMEA-
000160-PIP01-M01).  In  response  to  concerns  raised  by  the  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO)  during  the 
review rounds for the PIP on the lack of traditional dose-ranging studies (EMA/PDCO summary report 
EMA/737469/2010),  a  dose-ranging  study  was  added  to  the  PIP,  Study  Q-PAN  H5N1-023.  The  dose-
Assessment report  
Page 66/67 
 
 
  
 
ranging study Q-PAN H5N1-023 in children aged 6 months to <36 months was conducted concurrently 
with study D-PAN H5N1-013 in children aged 6 months to 35 months using a half adult dose. 
Design 
Study Q-PAN H5N1-023 was a randomised, observer blind dose-ranging study, which is acceptable for 
a dose-ranging study. Both study D-PAN H5N1-013 and D-PAN H5N1-032 are open-label studies, which 
is regretted from a safety perspective as it might affect reporting of AEs, however it is not expected to 
influence immunogenicity results. 
Treatment 
In all studies, primary vaccination included 2 vaccination doses containing A/Indonesia vaccine according 
to a 0, 21 day schedule. During studies D-PAN H5N1-013 and D-PAN H5N1-032, the primary vaccination 
vaccine contained half adult dose, consisting of 1.9 µg A/Indonesia HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03B. 
Treatment during study Q-PAN H5N1-023 included half adult dose (190_B), quarter adult dose (090-C), 
half adult dose with less adjuvant (190_C), full adult dose with less adjuvant (375_C) and full adult dose 
(375_D).  
Study D-PAN H5N1-013 and D-PAN H5N1-032 investigated the effect of a heterologous booster 6 months 
after the start of the primary vaccination. The boost contained 1.9 µg A/turkey HA antigen adjuvanted 
with AS03B. Using a heterologous strain would mimic the response to an antigenically drifted strain. In 
the  case  of  an  influenza  pandemic  it  is  expected  that  the  strain  will  adapt  over  time,  consistent  with 
SARS-CoV-2.  Using  a  heterologous  strain  will  measure  cross-reactivity  and  determine  whether  an 
antigenically drifted strain would be able to elicit an anamnestic response. 
During  study  Q-PAN  H5N1-023,  a  year  after  the  primary  vaccination,  all  participants  were  given  an 
unadjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg A/Indonesia HA antigen. This mimics the situation that children 
encounter the pandemic causing strain 1 year after primary vaccination. An unadjuvanted vaccine was 
chosen to reduce reactogenicity. This set up is acceptable.  
Population 
The population enrolled in the clinical studies consisted of healthy children. This is considered acceptable 
as this would represent the majority of the population to be vaccinated during a pandemic setting. The 
studies were conducted in Asia and Australia, with only study Q-PAN H5N1-021 being also conducted in 
the US and Canada. Considering the fact that the vaccine as it was prepared for the studies will not be 
used  as  such,  but  will  be  adapted  based  on  the  strain  causing  a  pandemic,  the  studies  were  used  to 
determine that the platform works and is immunogenic enough to induce a robust immune response. 
Therefore, the population is acceptable. 
Objectives 
During  study  Q-PAN  H5N1-023  the  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  different 
dosing  regimens  using  an  immunogenicity-fever  index.  The  usefulness  of  this  immunogenicity-fever-
index for both the HI as well as the MN antibodies is limited, as already mentioned during the scientific 
advice.  The  assessment  of  the  totality  of  evidence  will  be  based  on  the  immunogenicity  aspects 
mentioned in the Guideline on Influenza Vaccines. 
During study D-PAN H5N1-013 the primary objective was to assess whether a heterologous booster dose 
(containing 1.9 μg A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 HA with AS03B) given 6 months following a 2-dose primary 
vaccination  series  with  1.9  μg  A/Indonesia/05/2005  HA  with  AS03B  elicits  an  antibody  response  that 
meets  the  SCR  of  >40%,  SPR  of  >70%  and  MGI  of  >2.5  based  on  HI  responses  to 
A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 10 days following booster vaccination. As there is no correlate of protection, 
Assessment report  
Page 67/68 
 
 
  
 
the clinical impact of meeting any pre-defined immunogenicity criteria is unknown. SPR, which assumes 
a correlate of protection, is not considered a clinically relevant measure and will not be presented. 
During  study  D-PAN  H5N1-032  the  primary  objective  was  to  assess  superiority  of  the  A/turkey  HI 
antibody  response  10  days  following  boost  with  A/turkey  on  Day  182  (containing  1.9  μg 
A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005  HA  antigen  adjuvanted  with  AS03B)  in  subjects  previously  primed  with  two 
doses of heterologous A/Indonesia vaccine versus non primed subjects. Criterion used: lower limit of the 
2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the HI GMT ratio on Day 192 (Group H5N1_H5N1 compared to 
Group  Havrix_H5N1)  was  greater  than  1.0.  In  general,  the  primary  endpoint  can  be  agreed  as  it  will 
allow for comparison of the anamnestic response between primed and unprimed individuals. However, 
again  as  there  is  no  correlate  of  protection  the  immune  response  should  be  convincing  regardless  of 
meeting any pre-defined statistical criteria 
For all studies, the following secondary outcomes were reported for HI and MN antibody responses at 
different  time  points:  GMT,  SCR/VRR,  SPR  and  MGI.  As  stated  above,  the  focus  is  on  GMTs  where 
presented as primary endpoint by the MAH and on the SCR/VRR. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Children aged 3 years to 17 years 
In both studies in the age category 3 years to <18 years, study D-PAN H5N1-032 and Q-PAN H5N1-021, 
the  primary  vaccination  with  a  vaccine  containing  A/Indonesia  +  AS03B  induced  a  robust  increase  in 
homologous HI antibodies, leading to an SCR of nearly 100% (≥99%) at 21 days after vaccination. HI 
antibodies  declined  over  time,  however  GMTs  remained  well  above  baseline  for  at  least  6  months  in 
study  D-PAN  H5N1-032  and  12  months  in  study  Q-PAN  H5N1-021,  with  an  MGI  of  ≥9.1  and  ≥3.6, 
respectively.  A  similar  response  was  seen  in  vaccine-homologous  MN  antibodies,  leading  to  a  VRR  of 
>97%. MN antibodies also decline over time, but remain well above baseline for at least 6 months in 
study D-PAN H5N1-013 and 12 months in study Q-PAN H5N1-021. 
Vaccine-heterologous HI antibodies, only studied in study D-PAN H5N1-032, also increased substantially 
after the primary vaccination with A/Indonesia, leading to an SCR of ≥98.0% at Day 42 (21 days after 
the primary vaccination). Again, titers decline over time, but remain well above baseline with an MGI of  
≥5.6.  A  similar  response  was  seen  in  vaccine-heterologous  MN  antibodies,  with  a  substantial  peak  in 
GMTs seen at Day 42, which decline over time.  
During study D-PAN H5N1-032 it was shown that 10 days after a booster with a vaccine containing the 
H5N1/Turkey strain, H5N1/turkey HI GMTs increased in both primed and unprimed individuals, however, 
the  increase  was  significantly  higher  in  the  primed  group,  indicating  the  presence  of  an  anamnestic 
immune response to an antigenically drifted strain after primary vaccination with H5N1/Indonesia. SCR 
of A/turkey HI in primed individuals was 100% 10 days after the boost, while in unprimed individuals 
this was 32.1%. These results indicate that priming substantially increases the immune response to a 
heterologous boost. 
In  addition  to  the  A/turkey  HI  parameters,  10  days  after  the  booster  primed  individuals  showed  a 
substantial response in A/Indonesia HI parameters, in that GMTs increased to 674.1, SCR was 100% 
and MGI was 117.7. This indicates that, an antigenically drifted strain (A/turkey) was able to elicit an 
anamnestic response for A/Indonesia antibodies that was higher compared to the primary response at 6 
months after the primary vaccination. In unprimed individuals, 10 days after the heterologous booster 
dose  A/Indonesia    GMTs,  SCR  and  MGI  increased  only  slightly.  This  response  persisted  for  at  least  6 
months, as at D364, 6 months after booster vaccination with A/turkey, A/Indonesia HI parameters were 
substantially increased compared to prevaccination, with a GMT of 205.5 compared to 5.7 and an SCR

of  100%.  In  unprimed  individual,  which  only  received  a  single  dose  of  A/turkey  containing  vaccine, 
A/Indonesia HI parameters at 6 months after the dose were comparable to prevaccination parameters. 
This indicates that a primary vaccination is required before a single dose can induce lasting cross-reactive 
immune response. 
Overall, vaccination with half adult dose was able to induce a robust immune response. This is in line 
with the conclusions reached during review of the data by the VWP in connection to the scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/3998/1/2018/PED/II.),  as  it  was  found  that  the  data  could  support  use  of  half  the  adult 
dose down to 3 years of age. 
Children aged 6 months to 36 months 
The most relevant study for this age group is the dose finding study Q-PAN H5N1-023, which compared 
immunogenicity of half adult dose (190_B), quarter adult dose (090-C), half adult dose with less adjuvant 
(190_C), full adult dose with less adjuvant (375_C) and full adult dose (375_D) in a single study. 
All dosing regimens elicited a robust vaccine-homologous immune response at Day 42, 21 days after the 
primary vaccination series, as both SCR (evaluating HI antibodies) and VRR (evaluating MN antibodies) 
were 100% for all formulations. In addition, SCR and VRR for a heterologous HI antigen (A/Vietnam) 
was  >80%  in  all  groups,  indicating  that  21  days  after  a  primary  vaccination  series  using  all  doses,  a 
substantial immune response was generated to an antigenically drifted strain. An immune response to 
an H5N8 strain could also be detected, leading to SCR of 56.7% in group 190_B, 37.5% in group 090_C, 
29.4% in group 190_C, 20.0% in group 375_C and 26.7% in group 375_D. 
The primary vaccination induced both vaccine-homologous and -heterologous HI and MN antibody titres 
in  all  groups,  which  declined  over  time  but  remained  above  baseline  for  1  year.  A  booster  dose  of 
unadjuvanted vaccine 1 year after the primary vaccination was able to elicit an immune response in all 
groups,  however  this  response  measured  7  days  after  the  booster  was  lower  compared  to  the  initial 
immune response seen at Day 42. 
The dosing regimens of groups 190_B and 090_C elicited the highest immune response of all groups for 
HI and MN antibodies. Although numerically the response in group 190_B was higher, the increase in 
immunogenicity was considered small. At Day 42, SCR and VRR to homologous stimulation was 100% 
in both groups. Heterologous stimulation led to an SCR and VRR of 100% in group 190_B and >91% in 
group  090_C.  For  both  HI  and  MN  antibodies,  the  unadjuvanted  vaccine  1  year  after  the  primary 
vaccination was able to elicit a robust vaccine-homologous and -heterologous immune response in both 
groups, though this response was lower compared to the original response at Day 42. Vaccination during 
a  pandemic  setting  is  deployed  first  and  foremost  to  induce  a  vaccine-homologous  immune  response 
quickly, to reduce spread of the virus and mortality/illness in the naïve population. 
Study D-PAN H5N1-013 and Q-PAN H5N1-021 both investigated the immunogenicity of half adult dose 
(1.9 µg A/Indonesia HA antigen + AS03B). Study Q-PAN H5N1-021 enrolled children aged 6 months to 
<18  years  and  evaluated  immunogenicity  in  the  following  age  categories:  6  months  to  <36  months, 
3 years to <9 years and 9 years to <18 years. Similar results were observed compared to study Q-PAN 
H5N1-023 as the primary vaccination induced a robust increase in homologous HI antibodies, as an SCR 
of 100% was seen at D42. HI antibodies declined over time, however GMTs remained well above baseline 
for  at  least  6  months  in  study  D-PAN  H5N1-013  and  12  months  in  study  Q-PAN  H5N1-021.  A  similar 
response  was  seen  in  vaccine-homologous  MN  antibodies,  leading  to  a  VRR  of  100%  at  Day  42.  MN 
antibodies also decline over time, but remained well above baseline for at least 6 months in study D-
PAN H5N1-013 and 12 months in study Q-PAN H5N1-021. 
Study Q-PAN H5N1-021 showed that the response for vaccine-heterologous MN antibody titers develop 
similarly  compared  to  the  vaccine-homologous  MN  titers,  though  to  a  considerably  lesser  extent.  The 
Assessment report

peak GMT in the 6 months to 36 months age category  was 68.18 (58.05-80.07) compared to 855.62 
(597.88-1224.47). 
Study  D-PAN  H5N1-013  showed  that  6  months  after  primary  vaccination  with  A/Indonesia,  vaccine-
heterolgous (A/turkey) HI and MN antibodies were well above baseline levels, indicating that the primary 
vaccination was able to elicit an antibody response to an antigenically drifted strain, leading to an SCR 
of >95% and VRR of >82% at 6 months after the primary vaccination. Ten days after a heterologous 
booster, a substantial immune response as measured by A/turkey and A/Indonesia HI parameters was 
seen,  as  reflected  by  a  SCR  of  100%  (both  A/turkey  and  A/Indonesia)  and  a  MGI  of  >357.7  (302.4-
423.2)  and  357.5  (310.5-411.7)  respectively.  This  indicates  that  an  antigenically  drifted  strain 
(A/turkey)  was  able  to  elicit  an  anamnestic  response  for  A/Indonesia  antibodies  that  was  higher 
compared to the primary response (as seen as GMTs at D42) at 6 months after the primary vaccination. 
In  addition,  primed  individuals  are  able  to  quickly  mount  a  substantial  immune  response  to  an 
antigenically drifted strain. Substantial cross-reactivity is seen in the immune response. In a real world 
setting during a pandemic, this would mean that up to 6 months after the primary vaccination vaccinated 
individuals would be able to elicit a robust immune response to an antigenically drifted influenza strain. 
As study Q-PAN H5N1-021 enrolled children aged 6 months to <18 years and evaluated immunogenicity 
in the following age categories: 6 months to <36 months, 3 years to <9 years and 9 years to <18 years, 
a direct comparison of immune response in the different age categories could be made. It was observed 
that the vaccine-homologous HI and MN antibody response was highest in the youngest age category, 
as GMTs were highest. This indicates that immunogenicity of the adjuvanted vaccine declined with age 
and was highest in the age category of 6 months to 36 months.  
Overall, the immunogenicity data showed that a quarter adult dose was only slightly less immunogenic 
compared  to  a  half  adult  dose  in  children  aged  6  months  to  36  months.  The  vaccine-homologous  HI 
response  was  comparable  shortly  after  vaccination  as  at  Day  42  an  SCR  of  100%  was  seen  for  both 
groups,  however  numerically,  GMTs  were  slightly  lower  in  the  090_C  group  compared  to  the  190_B 
group  (858.8  [659.2-1118.8]  vs  1118.6  [884.4-1414.9]  respectively).  Over  time  a  slightly  higher 
reduction  in  vaccine-homologous  antibody  titers  was  observed  in  the  090_C  group  compared  to  the 
190_B group, as 1 year after primary vaccination SCR was 97.1% (84.7-99.9) in the 190_B group and 
78.8% (61.1-91.0) in the 090_C group. In addition, vaccine-heterologous responses were also slightly 
lower.  The  clinical  relevance  of  this  slight  decrease  is  unknown.  The  slightly  lower  immune  response 
might be compensated by the fact that the immune response in this age category is higher. This is in 
line with the conclusions reached during review of the data by the VWP in connection to the scientific 
advice  (EMEA/H/SA/3998/1/2018/PED/II.),  as  it  was  found  that  a  quarter  dose  might  be  sufficiently 
immunogenic in the age category of 6 months to 36 months. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the results indicate that Adjupanrix was very immunogenic across all ages from 6 months to 
17 years, especially shortly after vaccination as measured 21 days after primary vaccination. This is 
the most relevant period in a pandemic situation. A trend towards a higher immune response is seen in 
the age group 6 months to 36 months compared to 3 years to 17 years.  
The data support use of half the adult dose down to 3 years of age. In children aged 6 months to 36 
months a quarter adult dose was deemed sufficiently immunogenic, especially in light of the increased 
immunogenicity in subjects of this age category as compared to children 3 years and older and the 
reduction in reactogenicity.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  discussion  of  clinical  safety  is  based  on  available  safety  data  from  4  clinical  studies.  The  safety 
results  from  the  4  studies  were  not  pooled  due  to  the  heterogeneity  of  the  paediatric  studies  (e.g., 
studies were not uniformly blinded and included different age groups [6 months to <36 months and 3 
to <18 years of age] requiring different safety assessments). 
Study Q-PAN H5N1-023 enrolled children 6 months to less than 36 months old at time of first study 
vaccination  and  was  conducted  with  H5N1/Indonesia  (Q-Pan)  vaccine  (5  different  adjuvanted 
formulations for the primary 2-dose vaccination, and an unadjuvanted formulation [A/Indonesia, 3.75 
μg  HA]  for  the  booster  dose).  Safety was  assessed  in  terms  of  solicited  and  unsolicited  AEs  recorded 
during  their  respective  follow-up  periods  and  in  terms  of  MAEs,  adverse  events  of  special  interest 
(AESIs), pIMDs and SAEs during the entire study period. 
Study D-PAN H5N1-013 enrolled children 6 months to less than 36 months old at time of first study 
vaccination and was conducted with H5N1/Indonesia (D-Pan) vaccine, and with a heterologous booster 
dose  of  H5N1/Turkey.  Safety  and  reactogenicity  was  assessed  in  terms  of  solicited  and  unsolicited 
adverse  events  (AEs)  recorded  during  their  respective  follow-up  periods,  and  in  terms  of  medically-
attended AEs (MAEs), potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
from the first vaccination up to study end. 
Study  D-PAN  H5N1-032  enrolled  children  3  to  17  years  of  age  (inclusive)  at  the  time  of  the  first 
vaccination and was conducted with H5N1/Indonesia (D-Pan) and with a heterologous booster dose of 
H5N1/Turkey. Safety was assessed in terms of solicited and unsolicited AEs recorded during their follow-
up solicited periods, and in terms of MAEs, pIMDs and SAEs during the entire study. 
Study  Q-PAN  H5N1-021  enrolled  children  ≥6  months  and  <18  years  of  age  at  the  time  of  first 
vaccination in study year 1 and was conducted with H5N1/Indonesia (Q-Pan) vaccine (during both study 
years). Safety and reactogenicity was assessed in terms of solicited and unsolicited AEs recorded during 
their respective follow-up periods, and in terms of MAEs, pIMDs and SAEs from the first vaccination until 
study end. Clinical laboratory abnormalities were also evaluated up to Day 182 for half of the subjects, 
and up to Day 385 for the remaining subjects. 
Due to the fact that study set-up was different, different formulations of the vaccine were used (D-PAN 
vs Q-PAN) and the studies included children from different age categories, it was agreed not to pool the 
studies. 
The main safety evidence for the quarter dose, to be used in children 6 months to 36 months of age at 
time of first vaccination, comes from study Q-PAN H5N1. However, as only 37 children were included in 
the  group  receiving  the  quarter  dose,  additional  safety  data  is  retrieved  using  the  additional  dosages 
investigated  during  the  dose-ranging  study,  study  D-PAN  H5N1-013  and  the  subjects  6  months  to 
<36 months included in study Q-PAN H5N1-021. Both latter studies used half adult dose, containing 1.9 
μg HA+AS03B. 
The main safety evidence for children 3-17 years of age comes from study D-PAN H5N1-032, which is 
supported by data collected in individuals 3-17 years of age included in study Q-PAN H5N1-021.

Safety evaluation methods 
The methods used for safety evaluation were consistent across the submitted studies.  
Solicited local and systemic AEs (reactogenicity) 
Diary  cards  were  provided  to  the  subjects/subjects’  parent(s)/LAR(s)  to  record  solicited  (local  and 
systemic) and unsolicited symptoms. Collection and verification of completed diary cards was performed 
during discussion with the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) at the next planned site visit. 
In  all  studies,  solicited  local  (pain,  redness  and  swelling)  and  systemic  (drowsiness,  fever, 
irritability/fussiness,  loss  of  appetite,  diarrhoea  and  vomiting)  AEs  occurring  within  7  days  post-each 
vaccination were collected. In addition, in studies D-PAN H5N1-032 and Q-PAN H5N1-021, fatigue, fever, 
gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain), headache, arthralgia 
and myalgia were collected in subjects ≥ 6 years of age. In addition, in study Q-PAN H5N1-021, solicited 
systemic AEs also included shivering (chills) and increased sweating (for children ≥6 years old). 
Unsolicited AEs 
Occurrence of unsolicited AEs was collected during the 21-day (Days 0–20) follow-up period after each 
vaccination  and  overall  (Days  0–84  in  studies  D-PAN  H5N1-013  and  032;  Days  0–42  in  study  Q-PAN 
H5N1-023; and Days 0–42 and U0–U42 [Days 0–42 after unblinding in Year 2, in subjects that received 
Placebo during Year 1] in study Q-PAN H5N1-021). In addition, in study Q-PAN H5N1-023, the occurrence 
of unsolicited AEs was followed up for 30 days after the administration of the unadjuvanted booster dose. 
SAEs and AESIs 
In all studies, the SAEs were collected and recorded during the entire study period.  
In study Q-PAN H5N1-023, AEs of special interest (AESI) were also collected throughout the entire study 
period.  These  were  identified  using  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  preferred 
terms (PTs) or Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) as recommended in the Committee for Medicinal 
Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  Risk  Management  Plan  for  Pandemic  Vaccines  (CHMP,  2009).  AESIs 
included  the  events  listed  below;  the  MedDRA  PT  or  SMQ  used  to  identify  reports  of  these  events  is 
provided in parentheses: 
•  Anaphylaxis (narrow SMQs “Anaphylactic reaction” and “Angioedema”) 
•  Bell’s palsy (MedDRA PT “VIIth nerve palsy”) 
•  Convulsion (narrow SMQ “Convulsions”) 
•  Demyelination (narrow SMQ “Demyelination”) 
•  Encephalitis (narrow SMQ “Non-infectious encephalitis”) 
•  Guillain-Barré syndrome (narrow SMQ “Guillain-Barré syndrome”) 
•  Neuritis (MedDRA PT “Neuritis”) 
•  Vasculitis (narrow SMQ “Vasculitis”) 
Intensity grading 
In all studies, the investigator assessed the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all solicited local and systemic AEs based on a 4-point intensity scale (from grade 0 to grade 
3). 
Assessment report  
Page 72/73 
 
 
  
 
 
Causal relationship 
The investigator was obligated to assess the relationship between the investigational product and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE, based on clinical judgement. Alternative plausible causes, based on natural 
history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors and the temporal relationship 
of the event to the investigational product were to be considered and investigated. 
In  studies  D-PAN  H5N1-013  and  D-PAN  H5N1-032,  in  case  of  concomitant  administration  of  multiple 
vaccines, it could not be possible to determine the causal relationship of systemic AEs to the individual 
vaccines  administered.  The  investigator  should,  therefore,  have  assessed  whether  the  AE  could  be 
related to vaccination rather than to the individual vaccines. 
All solicited local (injection site) reactions were considered related to vaccination. 
Safety evaluation populations 
In  all  studies,  the  Total  Vaccinated  Cohort  (TVC)  included  all  vaccinated  subjects  with  at  least  one 
documented  vaccine  administration.  In  study  Q-PAN  H5N1-023,  the  TVC  for  booster  safety  analysis 
included all the subjects who received the booster dose. In study Q-PAN H5N1-021, the TVC included all 
subjects who received at least one study vaccination during the relevant portion of the study. 
In studies D-PAN H5N1-013, D-PAN H5N1-032 and Q-PAN H5N1-021 the According-to-protocol (ATP) 
cohort for analysis of safety included all vaccinated and eligible subjects who met all inclusion criteria 
and  no  exclusion  criteria  for  the  study,  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  vaccine,  for  whom 
administration site of study vaccine/comparator was known, and subjects who had not received a vaccine 
not specified or forbidden in the protocol. Since the percentage of enrolled subjects excluded from the 
TVC for analysis of safety (in study D-PAN H5N1-013)/ATP cohort for analysis of safety (in studies D-
PAN H5N1-032 and Q-PAN H5N1-021) was less than 5% in any treatment group/year, no second analysis 
on the ATP cohort was carried out. 
In general, methods to assess the reactogenicity and safety of Adjupanrix were considered appropriate. 
Reactogenicity as measured by local injection-site reactions and systemic reactions was followed for 14 
days, which was considered appropriate (see Guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines). Unsolicited 
AEs  were  collected  during  at  least  21  days  after  vaccination  in  all  studies  and  SAEs  were  collected 
throughout the study period. Subjects were followed for a sufficient period of time in clinical studies to 
collect relevant adverse events. 
In children aged 6 months to 36 months, the measurement of the solicited local AE of pain is considered 
to be very subjective, as it depends on touch of parent/legal guardian, which makes interpretation of 
results concerning this solicited AE difficult.

Table 36 Number of subjects who received study vaccine doses in all studies – Total vaccinated cohort 
(study D-PAN H5N1-013, D-PAN H5N1-032, Q-PAN H5N1-023, Q-PAN H5N1-021) 
In study Q-PAN H5N1-023, in the TVC, the mean age (± SD) at the time of first vaccination was 21.4 
(± 8.2) months. There was an unequal distribution of males and females across groups; fewer females 
were observed in the 190_B, 090_C and 190_C groups. Overall, most subjects were of Asian heritage 
(56.2% Asian/East Asian and 43.2% Asian/South East Asian). 
In study D-PAN H5N1-013, in the TVC, the mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) at the time of first 
vaccination was 16.9 (± 9.29) months. Most of the subjects were of Asian/South-East Asian heritage 
(72.6%). The study group included a higher proportion of females (55.8%). 
In study D-PAN H5N1-032, in the TVC, the mean age (± SD) at the time of first vaccination was 9.5 (± 
4.06) years. The study groups were balanced in terms of gender distribution and all participants were 
of Asian/South-East Asian heritage.  
In study Q-PAN H5N1-021, in the TVC for year 1, the mean age (± SD) at the time of first vaccination 
was 84.9 (± 61.37) months. The study groups were balanced in terms of gender distribution and most 
of the subjects were of Caucasian/European heritage (45%). In the TVC for year 2 (consisting of a 
subset of Placebo recipients in Year 1), the mean age (± SD) at the time of first vaccination was 84.5 
(± 59.78) months.

The  number  of  participants  aged  6  months  to  <36  months,  exposed  to  at  least  1  dose  of  0.9  µg  HA 
antigen + AS03C is relatively small, 37 subjects. Safety information in this age group is bolstered using 
safety data from participants in the same age group, exposed to at least 1 dose of 1.9 µg HA antigen + 
AS03B, which included 38 subjects in study Q-PAN H5N1-023, 113 subjects in study D-PAN H5N1-013 
and 249 subjects in study Q-PAN H5N1-021.   
The number of participants aged 3 to <18 years, exposed to 2 doses of 1.9 µg HA antigen + AS03B, 
during  the  pivotal  study  is  312.  This  data  is  bolstered  by  512  participants  in  study  Q-PAN  H5N1-021 
aged 3 to <18 years exposed to at least 1 dose of 1.9 µg HA antigen + AS03B. 
Adverse events 
Children aged 6 months to 36 months 
Study Q-PAN H5N1-023 
During the 7-day post-vaccination periods, at least one symptom (solicited and unsolicited) was reported 
for 92.1% of the subjects in the 190_B group, 70.3% in the 090_C group, 81.6% in the 190_C group, 
86.5% in the 375_C group and 80.0% in the 375_D group.  
At least one solicited systemic AE was reported for 89.5%, 62.2%, 71.1%, 64.9% and 68.6% of subjects

Study Q-PAN H5N1-021 
During the 7-day post-vaccination periods, at least one symptom (solicited and unsolicited) was reported 
for 74.9% of the subjects in the Q-PAN group and 68.0% in the Placebo group. At least one solicited AE 
was  reported  for  71.9%  of  subjects  (58.4%  overall/dose)  in  the  Q-PAN  group  compared  to  58.7%  of 
subjects (44.2% overall/dose) in the Placebo group. Overall, for 60.8% of subjects in the Q-PAN group 
at least one systemic symptom was reported and for 48.2% at least one local symptom was reported. 
In  the  Placebo  group  at  least  one  systemic  symptom  was  reported  for  50.7%  of  subjects  and  29.3% 
reported at least one local symptom.  
In total, 12.1% of subjects experienced a Grade 3 solicited AE in the Q-PAN group vs 9.3% in the Placebo 
group. Vaccine related grade 3 solicited AEs were experienced by 8.5% of subjects in the Q-PAN group 
vs 6.7% of subjects in the Placebo group.

In  the  age  group  6  months  to  <36  months,  the  majority  of  subjects,  ranging  from  70.3%  to  94.6%, 
receiving any dose of the primary vaccination with H5N1 vaccine, experienced at least 1 AE (solicited or 
unsolicited). 
Of the subjects receiving a quarter adult dose, 70.3% experienced at least 1 AE. A solicited systemic AE 
was  reported  by  62.2%  of  subjects  and  a  local  AE  by  29.7%  of  subjects.  A  grade  3  solicited  AE  was 
reported by 13.5% of subjects, of which 10.8% were considered related to the vaccine.

Table 37 Most frequently report solicited systemic AE overall by dose and subject (Q-PAN H5N1-023) 
Overall  by  dose,  the  incidence  of  fever  ranged  from  15.8%  (190_C  group)  to  38.7%  (190_B  group). 
Overall  per  subject,  fever  was  reported  for  60.5%  of  subjects  in  190_B  group,  40.5%  of  subjects  in 
090_C group, 31.6% of subjects in the 190_C group, 32.4% of subjects in 375_C group and 28.6% of

Fever ≥38.0°C was reported after 20.2% of doses (in 33.0% of subjects). Fever (≥39.0°C) was the most 
frequently  reported  solicited  systemic  AE  of  grade  3  (reported  after  3.6%  of  doses).  Grade  4  fever 
(>40.0°C) was not reported after primary vaccination. 
The  most  frequently  reported  solicited  systemic  AE  considered  by  the  investigator  as  related  to 
vaccination was irritability/fussiness, reported after 33.6% of doses, followed by fever, reported after 
21.1% of doses.  
The most frequently reported grade 3 solicited systemic AEs considered by the investigator as related to 
vaccination were irritability/fussiness and fever (≥39.0°C), each reported after 3.1% of doses.

Study Q-PAN H5N1-021 
Year 1: 
After  the  2  primary  doses  of  D-PAN  vaccine  (A/Indonesia,  1.9  μg  HA+AS03B),  the  most  frequently 
reported solicited systemic AE was irritability/fussiness in both the Q-PAN and Placebo group, reported 
after 35.4% of doses in 50.5% of subjects in the Q-PAN group and 29.0% of doses in 39.7% of subjects 
in the Placebo group. 
Fever ≥38.0°C was reported after 12.5% of doses in 22.4% of subjects in the Q-PAN group compared 
to  after  8.3%  of  doses  in  16.4%  of  subjects  in  the  Placebo  group.  Fever  (≥39.0°C)  was  the  most 
frequently reported solicited systemic AE of grade 3, reported by 4.6% of subjects in the Q-PAN group 
and  5.5%of  subjects  in  the  Placebo  group.  Grade  4  fever  (>40.0°C)  was  not  reported  after  primary 
vaccination in the Q-PAN group, while it was reported for 2.7% of subjects in the Placebo group. 
The  most  frequently  reported  solicited  systemic  AE  considered  by  the  investigator  as  related  to 
vaccination  in  the  Q-PAN  group  was  irritability/fussiness,  reported  after  29.4%  of  doses,  followed  by 
drowsiness, reported after 18.8% of doses. In the Placebo group the most frequently solicited systemic 
AE  considered  related  to  the  vaccination  was  irritability/fussiness,  reported  after  24.8%  of  doses, 
followed by loss of appetite after 17.2% of doses. 
The most frequently reported grade 3 solicited systemic AEs considered by the investigator as related to 
vaccination were irritability/fussiness reported after 2.3% of doses, followed by drowsiness after 2.1% 
of doses in the Q-PAN group. In the Placebo group this was irritability/fussiness, loss of appetite and 
fever, reported after 2.1% of doses in all cases. 
Year 2: 
The  most  frequently  reported  solicited  systemic  AE  was  irritability/fussiness,  reported  after  31.0%  of 
doses in 44.0% of subjects in the Q-PAN group. 
Fever ≥38.0°C was reported after 5.0% of doses. Fever (≥39.0°C) was the most frequently reported 
solicited  systemic  AE  of  grade  3  (reported  after  2.0%  of  doses).  Grade  4  fever  (>40.0°C)  was  not 
reported after primary vaccination. 
The  most  frequently  reported  solicited  systemic  AE  considered  by  the  investigator  as  related  to 
vaccination was irritability/fussiness, reported after 23.0% of doses, followed by drowsiness, reported 
after 21.0% of doses.  
Assessment report

The most frequently reported grade 3 solicited systemic AEs considered by the investigator as related to 
vaccination  were  irritability/fussiness,  drowsiness  and  fever  (≥39.0°C),  each  reported  after  1.0%  of 
doses. 
Looking at the above results, in the age group 6 months to <36 months, the majority of subjects, ranging 
from  60.8%  to  89.5%,  receiving  the  primary  vaccination  with  H5N1  vaccine,  experienced  at  least  1 
systemic solicited AE. 
Of the subjects receiving a quarter adult dose, 090_C, 62.2% experienced at least 1 systemic solicited 
AE.  The  most  frequently  reported  systemic  AE  was  drowsiness,  reported  by  43.2%  of  subjects  after 
30.1%  of  doses.  Fever  was  reported  by  40.5%  of  subjects  after  15.8%  of  doses.  Grade  3  fever  was 
reported after 2.7% of doses in 5.4% of subjects. 
The  most  frequently  reported  systemic  solicited  AE  considered  related  to  the  vaccine  was  irritability, 
reported  after  24.7%  of  doses,  followed  by  drowsiness,  reported  after  23.3%  of  doses.  The  most 
frequently reported grade 3 related systemic AE were drowsiness and fever, both reported after 2.7% 
of doses. 
Of  the  subjects  receiving  a  half  adult  dose  (190_B),  60.8%-89.5%  experienced  at  least  1  systemic 
solicited AE. The most frequently reported systemic AE was irritability in studies D-PAN H5N1-013 and 
Q-PAN H5N1-021, reported by 44.0%-51.8% of subjects after 31.0%-38.1% of doses. In study Q-PAN 
H5N1-023,  the  most  frequently  reported  systemic  AE  was  overall  per  dose  drowsiness  and  irritability 
(after 40.0% of doses) and overall per subject drowsiness and fever, reported by 60.5% of subjects. 
Fever was reported by 22.4% to 60.5% of subjects after 12.5% to 38.7% of doses. Grade 3 fever was 
reported after 3.6%-9.3% of doses. Fever was more frequently reported in study Q-PAN H5N1-023, in 
60.5% of subjects after 38.7% of doses, compared to study D-PAN H5N1-013 and Q-PAN H5N1-021, 
reported by 8.0%-33.0% of subjects after 5.0%-20.2% of doses. 
The  most  frequently  reported  systemic  solicited  AE  considered  related  to  the  vaccine  was  irritability, 
reported after 23.0%-38.1% of doses, followed by drowsiness, reported after 18.8%-34.7% of doses, 
and fever, reported after 4.0%-34.7% of doses. The most frequently reported grade 3 related systemic 
AEs were irritability, drowsiness and fever, reported after 1.0%-6.7% of doses. 
These results indicate that the overall safety profile is comparable between the half and quarter adult 
dose, in that comparable AEs occur. However, the quarter dose is less reactogenic. Irritability was the 
most frequently reported systemic AE in all doses.  
Fever is an AE of concern as fever due to vaccination has been known to lead to febrile seizures. In study 
Q-PAN H5N1-023 Vaccine-related fever occurred in 22 subjects (57.9%) in group 190_B and 12 subjects 
(32.4%) in group 090_C, while Grade 3 fever (39.0-40.0˚C) related to the vaccine occurred in 5 subjects 
(13.2%) in group 190_B and 2 subjects (5.2%) in group 090_C. The mean duration of the fever was 
short (<2 days) for both groups. These results indicate that the incidence of fever is less after a quarter 
dose compared to half adult dose. 
During  study  D-PAN  H5N1-013  it  was  shown  that  after  the  booster  dose,  reporting  of  AEs  increased, 
with an increase seen in irritability/fussiness and fever. 
Post-hoc analysis 
A higher observed fever incidence post-primary vaccination was noted in subjects 6 to <36 months of 
age who received the 1.9 μg HA+AS03B formulation in study Q-PAN H5N1-023 as compared to the same 
age group administered the same formulation in studies D-PAN H5N1-013 and Q-PAN H5N1-021. Of note 
the sample size of subjects in this age group was small (N=38) in study Q-PAN H5N1-023. As a result 
of this notably higher fever rate and the small sample size, the Company conducted a post-hoc analysis 
Assessment report  
Page 81/82 
 
 
  
 
to pool the incidence of solicited local and systemic AEs from the 3 studies that enrolled subjects 6 to 
<36 months of age. 
The subset of subjects (Pooled 190_B) who received 2 doses of H5N1 D-PAN or Q-PAN vaccine (1.9 µg 
HA+AS03B formulation) was composed of: 
•  all subjects from study D-PAN H5N1-013 (N=113); 
•  all subjects from group 190_B from study Q-PAN H5N1-023 (N=38); 
•  subjects aged 6 to <36 months from study Q-PAN H5N1-021 (N=206: 199 subjects from Year 
1 and 7 subjects from Year 2) 
Overall per dose, fever (≥38.0°C) was reported after 17.1% of doses in the Pooled 190_B group and 
23.3% of doses in the 090_C group (Table 38). Grade 3 fever (≥39.0°C) was reported after 3.6% of 
doses in the Pooled 190_B group and 2.7% of doses in the 090_C group. 
Table 38 Post hoc analysis: incidence of fever during the 7-day post-vaccination period following H5N1 
vaccination of subjects 6 to <36 months, overall per dose (TVC) 
Fever (≥38.0°C) was reported by 12.5% of subjects in the Pooled 190_B group and 13.5% of subjects 
in the 090_C group post-dose 1; and by 21.8% of subjects in the Pooled 190_B group and 33.3% of 
subjects in the 090_C group post-dose 2. Grade 3 fever (≥39.0°C) was reported by 2.8% of subjects in 
the Pooled 190_B group and was not reported by subjects in the 090_C group post-dose 1; and by 4.4% 
of  subjects  in  the  Pooled  190_B  group  and  5.6%  of  subjects  in  the  090_C  group  post-dose  2.  Fever 
(≥38.0°C) considered by the investigator as related to vaccination was reported by 9.1% of subjects in 
the Pooled 190_B group and 8.1% of subjects in the 090_C group post-dose 1; and by 20.6% of subjects 
in the Pooled 190_B group and 30.6% of subjects in the 090_C group post-dose 2. 
Safety database in study Q-PAN H5N1-023 is small, with approximately 38 subjects per group.

Based on the pooled analysis, it appears that the incidence of fever was high in study Q-PAN H5N1-023, 
as  the  incidence  of  fever  reported  for  group  190_B  was  higher  as  compared  to  the  same  age  group 
administered  the  same  formulation.  In  the  pooled  analysis  overall  per  dose  fever  was  reported  after 
17.1% of doses compared to 38.7% of doses in the 190_B group in study Q-PAN H5N1-023. 
This post-hoc analysis showed that the incidence of fever was higher in study Q-PAN H5N1-023, however, 
this would probably also have applied to the 090_C group. This cannot be tested, as Q-PAN H5N1-023 
is the only study to include the quarter dose. The strength of evidence achieved using such a post-hoc 
analysis is limited, as the groups that are pooled were not randomised potentially leading to bias.

The most frequently reported systemic solicited AE reported muscle ache reported after 31.5% of doses 
in 45.3% of subjects, followed by headache reported after 18.8% of doses in 32.0% of subjects. The 
most frequently reported related solicited systemic AE was muscle ache, reported after 24.2% of doses 
in  37.3%  of  subjects,  followed  by  headache  reported  after  14.8%  of  doses  in  26.2%  of  subjects.  No 
grade  3  systemic  solicited  AEs  were  reported.  The  most  frequently  reported  grade  3  related  solicited 
systemic AEs were headache and fatigue, both reported after 0.7% of doses in 1.3% of subjects. 
Only 1 case of fever was reported. 
In  children  aged  3  to  <6  years,  the  most  frequently  reported  systemic  solicited  AE  after  the  primary 
vaccination with H5N1 vaccine was fever in study D-PAN H5N1-032 (reported after 11.7%-21.0% of D-
PAN  doses  in  23.3%-35.5%  of  subjects).  In  study  Q-Pan  H5N1-021  the  most  frequently  reported 
systemic solicited AE was irritability/fussiness reported in 13.7% of doses in 22.4% of subjects. 
In both studies, the most frequently reported grade 3 systemic solicited AE was fever ≥39.0˚C, reported 
after 2.6%- 4.8% of doses by 2.0% to 6.7% of subjects.  
Both studies showed a similar pattern with irritability/fussiness and fever being the dominant systemic 
solicited  AEs.  A  trend  for  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  fever  after  multiple  doses  was  seen  in  both 
studies. In study D-Pan H5N1-032 not only occurrence increased, but also intensity, as no fever ≥39.0˚C 
was seen following dose 1 in the H5_H5 group, but it did occur after dose 2 and 3. 
In children aged ≥6 years of age the most frequently reported systemic solicited AE after the primary 
vaccination with H5N1 vaccine was headache in study D-PAN H5N1-032 (reported after 24.4%-28.2% 
of  D-PAN  doses  in  38.4%-42.1%).  In  study  Q-Pan  H5N1-021  the  most  frequently  reported  systemic 
solicited AE was muscle ache reported in 27.3% of doses in 39.8% of subjects, followed by headache 
reported in 21.4% of doses in 32.4% of subjects. 
In both studies, the most frequently reported grade 3 systemic solicited AE was headache, reported after 
1.3%- 2.0% of doses and fever reported after 0.8%-4.8% of doses. 
The  most  frequently  reported  related  systemic  solicited  AEs  was  headache  in  study  D-PAN  H5N1-032 
and muscle ache followed by headache in study Q-Pan H5N1-021. In both studies, headache was the 
most frequently reported grade 3 related systemic solicited AE reported by 0.8% to 3.2% of subjects. 
In study D-PAN H5N1-032 an increase in fever was reported after Dose 2 compared to Dose 1, however, 
the incidence of fever was lower after Dose 3.

68.4%. Of note, during year 2 of study Q-PAN H5N1-021 only 26.5% of subjects reported an unsolicited 
AE. 
Of  the  subjects  receiving  a  quarter  adult  dose,  090_C,  20  subjects  (54.1%)  experienced  at  least  1 
unsolicited  AE.  Most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  AEs  were  in  the  system  organ  class  (SOC)  of 
infections and infestations. None of the unsolicited AEs were considered related to the vaccine.  
Of the subjects receiving a half adult dose (190_B), 49.2%-68.1% experienced at least 1 unsolicited AE, 
with  only  26.5%  of  subjects  reporting  an  unsolicited  AE  during  study  year  2.  The  most  frequently 
reported  unsolicited  AEs  were  in  the  system  organ  class  (SOC)  of  infections  and  infestations.  The 
percentage of subjects reporting a vaccine-related unsolicited AE was 3 ranged from 7.5% to 15.9%.  
Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported by 3.0% to 8.8% of subjects. In only 2 cases in the D-PAN H5N1-
013 study (1.8% of subjects) was the grade 3 unsolicited AE related to the vaccine (nasopharyngitis and

Year 2: 
No differentiation was made per age category. Within 21 days after the 2 primary doses of D-PAN vaccine 
(A/Indonesia, 1.9 μg HA+AS03B), 26.5% of Q-Pan subjects reported at least one symptom; 0.6% of Q-
Pan  subjects  reported  at  least  one  grade  3  symptom.  In  total,  1.9%  of  subjects  reported  a  related 
unsolicited symptom.  
In  the  studies,  the  percentage  of  participants  receiving  H5N1  vaccine  during  the  primary  vaccination 
series reported at least  1 unsolicited  AE ranged from 29.5% to 41.0%. The most frequently reported 
unsolicited AEs were in the SOC of infections and infestations. Unsolicited AEs with a causal relationship 
to  the  study  vaccine,  were  reported  in  3.3%-7.6%  of  participants  receiving  H5N1  vaccine  and  2.6%-
3.8% in the placebo/active comparator control group. 
Grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  in  0.3%-4.8%  of  subjects  receiving  H5N1  vaccine  and  2.5%-
6.9% in the placebo/active comparator control group. In study D-PAN H5N1-032 none of the grade 3 
unsolicited AEs were considered related to the vaccine. In study Q-PAN H5N1-021 during year 1 and 2,

SAEs children aged 6 months to 36 months 
Study Q-PAN H5N1-023 
During  the  entire  study,  SAEs  were  reported  in  29  of  the  185  subjects  (15.7%).  At  least  1  SAE  was 
reported for 13.2% of subjects in the 190_B group, 16.2% of subjects in the 090_C group, 26.3% of 
subjects in the 190_C group, 10.8% of subjects in the 375_C group and 11.4% of subjects in the 375_C 
group. None of the SAEs were assessed as being related to the vaccination by the investigator.  
One  subject  in  the  190_C  group  reported  a  potential  immune  mediated  disease  (pIMD)  of  Kawasaki 
disease. The event was assessed as not related to vaccination. 
Study D-PAN H5N1-013 
During the entire study, a total of 18 SAEs were reported for 9 subjects (8.0%). All SAEs were assessed 
by the investigator as not related and resolved at the time of study end. 
Study Q-PAN H5N1-021 
During the study year 1, SAEs were reported for 3 subjects (1.5%) in the Q-Pan vaccine group and none 
in the placebo group. None of the SAEs in the Q-PAN group were considered related to the vaccine.  
The  percentage  of  participants  reporting  an  SAE  in study  Q-PAN  H5N1-023  was  relatively  high,  29  of 
185  subjects  (15.7%).  The  percentage  of  participants  experiencing  an  SAE  in  the  quarter  adult  dose 
group was 16.2%. The percentage of participants experiencing an SAE in the half adult dose group was 
13.2%. None of the SAEs were considered related to the vaccine, which is agreed. 
The percentage of participants experiencing an SAE during study D-PAN H5N1-013 and Q-PAN H5N1-
021 ranged from 1.5% to 8.0%. None were considered related to the vaccine, which is agreed.  
One subject during study Q-PAN H5N1-021 developed febrile convulsion 11 days after dose 1 and was 
hospitalized for 3 days. This SAE is not considered related to the vaccine, considering a TTO of 11 days 
and the fact that during the 7 days post study vaccination the subject did not present with any fever. 
SEAs children aged 3 years to 17 years 
Study D-PAN H5N1-032 
From  Day  0  up  to  the  Day  364  visit,  SAEs  were  reported  for  four  subjects  (2.6%)  in  the  group 
H5N1_H5N1, one subject in the group H5N1_Havrix and no subjects for the groups Havrix_H5N1 and 
Havrix_Havrix. All the SAEs were resolved and none of the SAEs were assessed by the investigator to 
be related to vaccination. 
Study Q-PAN H5N1-021 
During the study year 1, SAEs were reported for 5 subjects (1.2%) in the Q-Pan vaccine group and 2 
subjects (1.2%) in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were considered related to the vaccine.

Two non-fatal SAEs (wound and scarlet fever) were reported during Study Year 2 (Days U0-U385). 
They were not considered related to vaccination 
The percentage of participants experiencing an SAE during study D-PAN H5N1-032 and Q-PAN H5N1-
021 ranged from 1.2% to 2.6%. None were considered related to the vaccine.   
Other significant events 
In  study  Q-PAN  H5N1-023,  AEs  of  special  interest  (AESI)  were  collected  throughout  the  entire  study 
period.  These  were  identified  using  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  preferred 
terms (PTs) or Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) as recommended in the Committee for Medicinal 
Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  Risk  Management  Plan  for  Pandemic  Vaccines  (CHMP,  2009).  AESIs 
included  the  events  listed  below;  the  MedDRA  PT  or  SMQ  used  to  identify  reports  of  these  events  is 
provided in parentheses: 
•  Anaphylaxis (narrow SMQs “Anaphylactic reaction” and “Angioedema”) 
•  Bell’s palsy (MedDRA PT “VIIth nerve palsy”) 
•  Convulsion (narrow SMQ “Convulsions”) 
•  Demyelination (narrow SMQ “Demyelination”) 
•  Encephalitis (narrow SMQ “Non-infectious encephalitis”) 
•  Guillain-Barré syndrome (narrow SMQ “Guillain-Barré syndrome”) 
•  Neuritis (MedDRA PT “Neuritis”) 
•  Vasculitis (narrow SMQ “Vasculitis”) 
During the entire study, the percentage of subjects who had at least 1 AESI was 10.5% (190_B group), 
8.1%  (090_C  group),  7.9%  (190_C  group),  5.4%  (375_C  group)  and  5.7%  (375_D  group).  Three  of 
these AESIs were assessed to have a causal relationship to vaccination (urticaria in 1 subject in 190_B 
group and in 1 subject in 375_C group and periorbital oedema in 1 subject in 190_C group). 
Pregnancy 
During the entire D-PAN H5N1-032 study period, a total of 6 pregnancies were reported. The subjects 
were exposed to the vaccine before conception. Up to the end of the study, 4 subjects gave birth to male 
live healthy infants and 2 pregnancies were still ongoing. For these 2 pregnancies, the reported outcome 
was live births without congenital anomalies.  
During  Year  1  of  study  Q-PAN  H5N1-021,  2  subjects  in  group  Q-Pan  reported  a  pregnancy.  One 
pregnancy was reported 8 months after receipt of vaccine dose 2. Approximately 1 month after it was 
reported, the pregnancy ended in a spontaneous abortion. This was not considered by the investigator 
to be related to vaccination. The second pregnancy was reported 12 months after receipt of vaccine dose 
2. This pregnancy ended in a healthy live birth. 
No pregnancies were reported during Year 2 of study Q-PAN H5N1-021. 
In  the  CSR  of  study  D-PAN  H5N1-032,  6  pregnancies  were  reported,  however,  only  3  pregnancy 
outcomes were reported (all healthy males). No further information was presented. The MAH was asked 
to update the reports to include all relevant information. 
During Study Q-PAN H5N1-021 2 pregnancies were reported, of which 1 ended in spontaneous abortion 
and 1 in live birth. The abortion was not considered related to the vaccine, which is agreed. Upon request

the MAH provided the CIOMS form for the live birth. The subject delivered healthy infant-female without 
complications. 
All subjects were vaccinated prior to conception. No congenital or other abnormalities were reported. 
Narcolepsy 
Beginning  in  August  2010,  cases  of  narcolepsy  were  reported  in  children  and  adolescents  vaccinated 
with Pandemrix, initially in Finland and Sweden (Läkemedelsverket, 2011; Sarkanen 2018a). A series of  
retrospective  epidemiological  single  country  studies  were  conducted  in  several  European  countries  in 
addition to the multinational VAESCO (in 8 European countries) and SOMNIA (in 4 continents) studies 
(Sarkanen, 2018a, Sarkanen , 2018b; Sturkenboom, 2015; Verstraeten, 2016; Weibel, 2018; Wijnans, 
2013).  In  the  population  under  20  years  of  age,  most  studies  found  an  increase  in  relative  risk  of 
narcolepsy in those vaccinated with Pandemrix compared to those unvaccinated (Sturkenboom, 2015; 
Verstraeten, 2016; Weibel, 2018; Wijnans, 2013). Increased risk was mostly identified in the younger 
population  (Sturkenboom,  2015;  Verstraeten,  2016;  Weibel,  2018;  Wijnans,  2013).  In  the  various 
studies, the relative risk estimates of narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix ranged from 1.5 
to 25.0 (95% CI range: 0.3 to 48.5) in children, and from 1.1 to 18.8 (95% CI range: 0.6 to 207.4) in 
adults (Cohet, 2019; Thebault, 2013). 
Arepanrix, while having a slightly different viral antigen manufacturing process, has not been associated 
with a similar increased risk narcolepsy as compared to Pandemrix. The association between Arepanrix 
and narcolepsy has been assessed in a specific study in Quebec (Canada), based on validated cases of 
narcolepsy  from  sleep  centres  (Montplaisir,  2014).  In  their  primary  analysis,  the  relative  risk  was 
estimated as 4.3 (95% CI: 1.5, 11.1). This estimate is not incompatible with the ranges observed for 
Pandemrix (Sarkanen, 2018a). The authors of the Quebec study concluded their study by stating that 
their results were consistent with a risk of narcolepsy following administration of Arepanrix, but that the 
attributable  risk  was  of  small  magnitude  (approximately  1  case  per  million).  Attributable  risk  for 
Pandemrix was approximately 1 per 20,000 (Sarkanen, 2018a). 
Arepanrix vaccination occurred mostly in Canada and South America, while vaccination with Pandemrix 
occurred mostly in Europe. 
Overall,  there  is  no  robust  evidence  that  the  2  vaccines  are  likely  to  invoke  intrinsically  different 
immunologic  responses.  In  addition,  to  the  extent  the  currently  leading  hypothesis  suggests  that  the 
increased  risk  of  narcolepsy  reported  in  Europe  is  likely  the  result  of  molecular  mimicry  between  an 
epitope  within  the  H1N1pdm09  virus  and  peptides  from  proteins  produced  by  hypocretin  (HCRT)-
secreting neurons there are no data that would suggest that the 2 vaccines would differentially trigger 
such mimicry. The experts convened by the International Alliance for Biological Standardization (IABS) 
in  2018  concluded  that  explanation  for  the  apparent  differences  remain  an  open  question  (Edwards, 
2019).  Possible  explanations  include:  regional  difference  in  the  background  incidence  of  narcolepsy 
between the populations that received Pandemrix and Arepanrix; regional difference in the expression 
of  the  HLA-DQB1*06:02  allele  and  other  HLA  types;  regional  differences  in  the  timing  of  large-scale 
vaccination  programs  relative  to  H1N1pdm09  wild-type  virus  circulation;  regional  differences  in 
narcolepsy referral and diagnosis processes; and difference in media interest and/or public perceptions. 
Furthermore,  while  neither  Pandemrix  nor  Arepanrix  were  licensed  or  used  in  China,  an  increased 
incidence  of  narcolepsy  was  reported  in  China,  following  the  2009  H1N1  pandemic  (Han,  2011;  Han, 
2013). Similarly, an increased incidence of narcolepsy was observed in Germany (Oberle, 2015) and in 
Canada (province of Quebec) (Montplaisir, 2014) during the first wave of the 2009 pandemic, prior to 
initiation of the respective vaccination campaigns in those locations, and in Taiwan following H1N1pdm09

virus  circulation  (Huang,  2020).  Finally,  outside  of  the  pandemic  vaccination  period  a  2013  incidence 
peak in childhood narcolepsy was reported in several European countries, using the European Narcolepsy 
network 9EU-NN database (Zhang, 2020). 
It therefore appears that influenza infection can be a confounder and renders it difficult to separate risk 
associated  with  infection  from  risk  associated  with  vaccination.  Indeed,  because  the  A/H1N1pdm09 
pandemic preceded the vaccination campaign by a small margin in many European countries, including 
Ireland, Finland, Sweden and Norway, interpretation of the epidemiological data is confounded by the 
influenza viral infection data. 
Molecular mimicry 
One  proposed  mechanism  to  explain  an  auto-immune  aetiology  of  narcolepsy  involves  molecular 
mimicry, also referred to as cross-reactivity, at the CD4 T cell level. Type 1 narcolepsy with cataplexy is 
strongly associated with (HLA) DQB1*0602 (termed DQ0602 in this document) (Bassetti, 2019; Faraco, 
2013;  Fontana,  2010),  with  90–99%  of  narcolepsy  patients  being  positive  for  this  genetic  marker 
(Dauvilliers,  2007;  Fontana,  2010;  Mahoney,  2019;  Mieda,  2016;  Ollila,  2015;  Sarkanen,  2018a; 
Sarkanen, 2018b). The population prevalence of the DQ0602 marker is much higher (12–38%) (Ollila, 
2015)  than  the  prevalence  of  narcolepsy,  indicating  that  DQ0602  is  necessary  but  not  sufficient  for 
development of disease (Bomfim, 2017). DQ0602 belongs to the family of HLAs which play a key role in 
immune system regulation by interacting with CD4 T helper cells. 
The CD4 T cell cross-reactivity hypothesis asserts that cross-reactive CD4 T cells exist that can recognize 
peptides originating from A/H1N1pdm09 influenza proteins as well as peptides from proteins produced 
by (HCRT)-secreting neurons. Thus, CD4 T cells responding to the A/H1N1pdm09 influenza HA peptide 
would also recognize HCRT, which is secreted by the neurons and most likely presented to T cells by 
DQ0602-expressing  microglia.  It  has  been  further  hypothesised  that  these  peptides  are  uniquely 
presented by the DQ0602 molecule and that this explains the importance of DQ0602 as a genetic marker. 
The same HA peptide is present in the H1N1pdm09 vaccines (both Pandemrix and Arepanrix) and in the 
A/H1N1pdm09 influenza virus itself, which could explain why narcolepsy incidence increases have been 
observed in relation to A/H1N1pdm09  influenza virus in the absence of vaccination (Han, 2011; Han, 
2013; Han, 2014; Huang, 2020; Zhang, 2020). 
Aligned  with  this  proposed  mechanism  and  with  the  confounding  effect  of  H1N1pdm09  influenza 
infection, a “two-hit” hypothesis of auto-immune aetiology of narcolepsy has been proposed involving 
both  H1N1pdm09  viral  infection  and  vaccination  (Edwards,  2019;  Partinen,  2014).  On  the  basis  of  a 
specific genetic background (i.e., most importantly, the HLA DQ0602 allele), according to this “two-hit” 
hypothesis,  an  environmental  trigger  such  as  A/H1N1pdm09  influenza  virus  could  increase  risk  of 
narcolepsy by inducing a cross-reactive immune response. Subsequent vaccination could then potentially 
increase the frequency of the cross-reactive CD4 T cells.  
The “two-hit” hypothesis explains the observed effects of A/H1N1pdm09 influenza virus infection because 
the H1N1pdm09 influenza virus and the vaccine share the same peptide that has been hypothesized to 
act as a mimicry epitope because of structural similarity between this HA peptide and peptides in HCRT. 
If the putative mimicry peptide is specific for the A/H1N1pdm09 virus proteins, which is believed to be 
the  case,  it  would  explain  why  the  increased  risk  of  narcolepsy  was  not  detected  before  2009  (i.e., 
because the mimicry peptide was absent) and why the narcolepsy incidence peak in China was higher in 
2010 with very limited vaccination (with a vaccine other than Pandemrix) (Han, 2011; Han, 2012). A 
role of a mimicry peptide would further explain why, in a study in Sweden, the risk of narcolepsy was so 
specific, with no increases in incidence for any other disorder after vaccination (Schinkelshoek, 2019), 
because the risk would have been driven by peptide specificity.

To  study  cross-reactivity,  CD4  T  cells  specific  for  the  peptides  listed  HA275-287,  HCRT56-68  and 
HCRT87-100, were analysed at the single cell level and their T-cell receptor sequences were analysed 
(Luo,  2018;  Jiang,  2019;  Pandemrix  EPAR,  2016).  Shared  T-cell  receptors  were  identified,  and  this 
provided evidence that the same T cell could recognize both HA and HCRT peptides (Luo, 2018).  
Table 45 Peptide sequence of the purported cross-reactive peptides from HCRT-1, HCRT-2 and HA (HA 
from A/H1N1pdm09) 
Even  though  the  peptides  present  relatively  low  homology  in  their  primary  amino  acid  sequence,  the 
three-dimensional conformation of the peptide, as it is bound to the HLA groove was remarkably similar 
on the three-dimensional level, providing a potential molecular basis for cross-reactivity. The similarity 
between  the  HA  and  HCRT  peptides  was  also  demonstrated  on  the  3-dimensional  level  using  X-ray 
diffraction (Schinkelshoek, 2019). 
The cross-reactive CD4 T cells were detected in narcolepsy patients but also in DQ0602-matched healthy 
controls (Jiang, 2019; Pandemrix EPAR, 2016), suggesting that the mere presence of such cross-reactive 
T  cells  is  not  enough  to  trigger  symptomatic  disease.  The  “two-hit”  model  (Edwards,  2019;  Partinen, 
2014),  involving  H1N1pdm09  viral  infection,  could  explain  this  by  postulating  the  H1N1pdm09  viral 
infection would be the essential trigger and that risk would be increased if vaccination happens shortly 
after  the  infection.  Further  T  cell  data  have  been  published  that  are  consistent  with  this  hypothesis 
(Latorre, 2018). 
A  T-cell  based  aetiology  is  further  supported  by  pre-clinical  data  reported  by  Liblau  and  coworkers 
(Bernard-Valnet,  2016).  These  authors  designed  a  transgenic  mouse  model  in  which  HA  is  artificially 
expressed  in  HCRT  neurons,  allowing  to  bypass  mimicry  because  the  shared  protein  (HA)  is  already 
expressed  in  situ  (Bernard-Valnet,  2016).  In  this  model,  they  demonstrated  that  the  injection  of  HA-
specific CD8 T cells but not HA specific CD4 T cells was able to launch an immune attack, specific for HA, 
to the HCRT neurons, leading to mice with narcolepsy-like symptoms. It is possible that once an immune 
response is triggered by cross-reactive CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells are engaged at a next step. It is worth 
noting  that  various  studies  to  date  have  been  unable  to  detect  any  CD8  T  cell  responses  induced  by 
AS03-adjuvanted vaccines (Couch, 2014; Moris, 2011; Roman, 2011). 
The putative cross-reactive pHA1275-287 epitope (HA from A/H1N1pdm09) is located at the border of 
the HA1 globular domain of the H1N1pdm09 pandemic strain (Luo, 2018). Of this sequence, 5 amino 
acids  were  identified  as  critical  for  DQ0602  HLA  binding  (De  la  Herrán-Arita,  2013).  A  review  of  this 
corresponding sequence alignment has been performed for 4 additional analogous HA sequences in the 
context of the FLU-D-SUIV-ADJ-001 study, i.e., the chimeric HAs (cHA) used in the project (i.e., cH5/1, 
cH8/1  [which  has  the  identical  sequence  as  H8N4],  cH11/1  and  cH12/1)  (Figure  4).  These  data  are 
relevant because they include the analogous sequence from the H5 HA protein. DQ0602-binding data 
are shown in Figure 5 and demonstrate that the analogous peptide in the H5 HA protein does not bind 
to DQ0602 and it is therefore extremely unlikely that the same peptide mimicry as observed with H1 HA 
will  occur.  Binding  is  expressed  as  the  percentage  of  the  reference  peptide  EBV  displaced  by  a  given 
concentration of competitor test peptide and expressed as the concentration of competitor peptide that 
replaces 50% of the EBV reference peptide. Concentrations below ~50 μM are considered to reflect good

binding of the competitor peptide. Results from the competition experiments with the cH peptides are 
shown. None of the experimental peptides achieve EBV peptide replacement of >50%.

Figure 5 HLA DQ0602 binding of peptides generated based on HA1275-287 sequence of the 4 cHAs 
(i.e., cH5/1, H8N4, which has the identical sequence of cH8, cH11/1 and cH12/1, Figure 4) was 
assessed in vitro by using a peptide binding competition assay with an DQ0602-binding peptide from 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as reference peptide (De la Herrán-Arita, 2013; Jiang, 2019).  
Current epidemiological and immunological data support the hypothesis that cases of narcolepsy seen 
immediately  following  the  2009/2010  influenza  pandemic  were  the  result  of  an  immune  cascade 
triggered  by  CD4  T  cell  cross-reactivity  to  Haemagglutinin  (HA)  proteins  from  the  H1N1  virus  itself 
(DQ0602-restricted epitopes) and the HCRT neuropeptide (Luo, 2018). The HA275 cross-reactive peptide 
was identified in the H1 HA protein but its counterpart in H5 was shown to not bind DQ0602. This implies 
that the mechanism postulated for H1N1 cannot be extrapolated to H5N1, which does not therefore raise 
additional concerns for narcolepsy as a safety issue for Adjupanrix D-Pan H5N1.

As stated above, an increase in relative risk of narcolepsy in those vaccinated with Pandemrix compared 
to  those  unvaccinated,  especially  in  the  younger  population,  has  been  observed.  However,  increased 
incidences of narcolepsy have been observed following H1N1pdm09 virus circulation not associated with 
Pandemrix vaccination, indicating that influenza infection can be a confounder.   
A  current  hypothesis  is  that  molecular  mimicry  between  H1N1pdm09  influenza  HA  peptide  and  HCRT 
could play a role in the development of narcolepsy. Cross-reactive CD4 T have been shown to occur that 
recognize  both  peptides  originating  from  A/H1N1pdm09  influenza  proteins  as  well  as  peptides  from 
proteins  produced  by  (HCRT)-secreting  neurons,  which  could  ultimately  leads  to  the  destruction  of 
hypocretin secreting neurons. The peptides that induced cross-reactivity once bound to the HLA groove 
looked very similar, giving credence to the molecular mimicry hypothesis. However, the fact that cross-
reactive T-cells were found in both narcoleptic and not-narcoleptic individuals, means that having cross-
reactive  T-cells  is  not  enough.  This  inspired  the  “double-hit”  hypothesis,  which  could  explain  the 
involvement of natural infection and why only narcolepsy is so specifically increased after vaccination 
with Pandemrix. 
The  molecular  mimicry  hypothesis  seems  plausible;  however,  it  is  still  a  hypothesis  and  other 
mechanisms  should  not  be  ignored.  However,  this  does  indicate  that  the  MAH  should  continue  their 
research into biological mechanism to how the cross-reactive CD4 T-cells and potentially CD8 T-cells are 
involved in the aetiology of narcolepsy. Upon request, the MAH presented information to their ongoing 
commitment to investigate the biological mechanisms how cross-reactive CD4 T-cells could potentially 
be involved in the aetiology of narcolepsy. The molecular mimicry hypothesis will be further investigated 
using a novel transgenic mouse model, which could be interesting. In addition, the MAH indicated that 
once an influenza pandemic is declared and the Influenza strain identified, the research plan would then 
be  to  identify  the  corresponding  putative  cross-reactive  pHA1275-287  sequence  and  assess  the 
probability of the peptide to bind DQ0602 based on amino acid sequence using bioinformatic tools.   
The MAH has committed to closely monitoring narcolepsy should the product be used in a situation of 
mass immunisation, such as a next influenza pandemic, which is of the utmost importance. The MAH 
actively searches for relevant published data regarding the incidence of narcolepsy and incorporates this 
information within currently existing background incidence rates of narcolepsy. In addition, the MAH is 
aware  of  the  potential  bias  induced  by  narcolepsy  referral  and  diagnosis  processes  and  difference  in 
media interest and/or public perceptions and will endeavour to account for these at time of analysis. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations were carried out only in study Q-PAN H5N1-021. 
Eight  subjects  (1.3%)  in  the  Q-Pan  group  and  3  subjects  (1.3%)  in  the  placebo  group  reported 
haematological and/or biochemical abnormalities that were deemed by the investigators to be qualified 
as MAEs through the Day 385 contact. 
The information on laboratory assessments is considered extremely limited. 
Safety in special populations 
Not applicable. Only healthy children were enrolled in the studies.

Children aged 6 months to <36 months 
Study Q-PAN H5N1-023 
Overall per subject, the incidence of the use of any medication within the 21-day postvaccination period 
was 63.2% (190_B group), 59.5% (090_C group), 65.8% (190_C group), 70.3% (375_C) and 65.7% 
(375_D) of which 63.2%, 45.9%, 47.4%, 40.5%  and 34.3% of subjects from 190_B, 090_C, 190_C, 
375_C  and  375_D  groups,  respectively,  received  antipyretics.  Prophylactic  antipyretics  were 
administered  to  none  of  the  participants  in  groups  190_B  and  090_C  and  to  1  subject  in  each  of  the 
groups 190_C, 375_C and 375_D. 
Study D-PAN H5N1-013 
Overall, during the entire period up to Day 203, any concomitant medications were used by 101 (89.4%) 
subjects.  Ninety  (79.6%)  subjects  took  an  antipyretic.  Antipyretics  were  taken  prophylactically  in 
anticipation of reaction to vaccination by five (4.4%) subjects.  
There  was  an  apparent  increase  in  the  use  of  antipyretics  from  31.0%  following  Dose  1  to  50.0% 
following Dose 2 to 65.7% following Dose 3. 
Study Q-PAN H5N1-021 
Study Year 1: Considering the 21-day interval after each dose of vaccine/product, a total of 124 subjects 
(62.3%)  in  the  Q-Pan  group  and  40  (53.3%)  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  used  a  concomitant 
medication. Antipyretics were used by 95 Q-Pan subjects (47.7%) and by 29 placebo subjects (38.7%). 
In total, 2 participants used prophylactic antipyretics in during year 1 in the Q-PAN group and none in 
the placebo group. 
Concomitant medication was not split per age category for year 2. 
The majority of participants receiving H5N1 vaccination in all studies received concomitant medications, 
ranging from 59.5%-89.4%. 
Of  the  subjects  receiving  a  quarter  adult  dose,  090_C,  59.5%  received  concomitant  medication  and 
45.9% received antipyretics. None received prophylactic antipyretics. 
Of the subjects receiving a half adult dose (190_B), 62.3-89.4% received concomitant medication and 
47.7%-79.6% received antipyretics. None to 4.4% of subjects received prophylactic antipyretics. A trend 
towards increased use of concomitant medication and antipyretics was seen in subjects using half adult 
dose. 
Children aged 3 years to <18 years 
Study D-PAN H5N1-032 
Overall,  during  the  entire  period  up  to  Day  364,  concomitant  medication  was  used  by  199  subjects 
(63.8%) in the pooled H5N1 groups (H5_H5 and H5_Hav) and by 122 subjects (58.7%) in the pooled 
control groups (Hav_H5 and Hav_Hav). Antipyretics were used by 164 Q-Pan subjects (52.6%) and by 
100 placebo subjects (48.1%). 
In total, 5 (1.6%) participants used prophylactic antipyretics in the pooled H5N1 group and one (0.5%) 
in the placebo group.

Study Year 1: Considering the 21-day interval after each dose of vaccine/product, a total of 222 subjects 
(54.4%)  in  the  Q-Pan  group  and  74  (47.4%)  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  used  a  concomitant 
medication. Antipyretics were used by 152 Q-Pan subjects (37.2%) and by 41 placebo subjects (26.3%). 
In total, 1 participant used prophylactic antipyretics in during year 1 in the Q-PAN group and none in the 
placebo group. 
Concomitant medication was not split per age category for year 2. 
The majority of participants receiving H5N1 vaccination in all studies received concomitant medications, 
ranging  from  54.4%-63.8%,  of  which  37.2%-58.7%  received  antipyretics.  Of  the  subjects  in  the 
placebo/active  comparator  group,  47.4%-58.7%  of  subjects  received  concomitant  medications  and 
26.3%-48.1% used antipyretics. 
Prophylactic antipyretics were used in 0.2%-1.6% of subjects receiving H5N1 vaccination and none to 
0.5% in the active comparator/placebo group. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No (S)AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study were reported in studies D-PAN H5N1-013, D-
PAN  H5N1-032  and  Q-PAN  H5N1-021.  In  study  Q-PAN  H5N1-023,  1  subject  (from  190_B  group) 
experienced an AE (injection-site pain) that led to withdrawal from the treatment. 
Therefore, the number of discontinuations due to AEs is considered low, only 1 subject in all 4 studies. 
As only 1 subject was withdrawn no trends could be observed.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety in children and adolescents aged 6 months to <18 years is based upon 4 studies, 
in  which  a  total  of  1,372  subjects  who  received  2,741  doses  of  A/Indonesia  containing  H5N1  vaccine 
during  the  primary  vaccination  series.  Reactogenicity  was  followed  for  7  days  when  concerning  local 
injection-site reactions and systemic reactions, which is considered appropriate (see Guideline on clinical 
evaluation  of  vaccines).  Non-serious,  unsolicited  AEs  were  followed  for  an  appropriate  duration  and 
sufficient to identify AEs potentially related to vaccination.  
Children aged 3 years to <17 years 
Solicited Adverse Events 
In the age group 3 years to 17 years, the majority of subjects, ranging from 78.8% to 88.5%, receiving 
the primary vaccination with H5N1 vaccine experienced at least 1 solicited AE. Grade 3 solicited AEs, 
were reported by <12% of subjects (<6.9% overall/dose) in both studies. This is numerically slightly 
higher compared to the solicited AEs experienced  by the active comparator/placebo control groups in 
these studies, ranging from 47.5% to 76.0%. Grade 3 solicited AEs were reported by 1.3% to 7.1% of 
subjects. 
Assessment report

In the age group 3 years to 17 years, injection site pain was the most frequently reported solicited 
local  AE  in  all  age  stratums  after  primary  vaccination  with  H5N1  vaccine.  The  percentage  of  subjects 
reporting injection site pain ranged from 70.5% to 82.7%. Grade 3 pain was reported by 1.9%-5.4% of 
subjects. The majority of subjects experiencing injection site pain experienced mild to moderate pain. 
In  the  active  comparator/placebo  group,  pain  was  experienced  by  22.5%  to  70.2%  of  subjects,  with 
1.0% to 2.7% reporting Grade 3 pain. 
Both redness and swelling occurred much less frequently. Redness was reported by 1.3% to 5.6% of 
subjects, while 2.1% to 9.6% of subjects reported swelling. No grade 3 redness or swelling were reported 
in both studies after primary vaccination with H5N1 vaccine. In the active comparator/placebo group, 
redness and swelling was experienced by 0.0% to 1.0% of subjects and 0.0% to 1.9%. As with the H5N1 
primary  vaccination,  no  grade  3  redness  or  swelling  was  observed  in  the  active  comparator/placebo 
group. 
In children aged 3 to <6 years, the most frequently reported systemic solicited AE after the primary 
vaccination with H5N1 vaccine was fever in study D-PAN H5N1-032 (reported after 11.7%-21.0% of D-
PAN doses in 23.3%-35.5% of subjects) and irritability/fussiness in study Q-PAN H5N1-021 (reported in 
13.7% of doses in 22.4% of subjects). 
In both studies, the most frequently reported grade 3 systemic solicited AE was fever ≥39.0˚C, reported 
after 2.6%- 4.8% of doses by 2.0% to 6.7% of subjects.  
Both studies showed a similar pattern with irritability/fussiness and fever being the dominant systemic 
solicited  AEs.  A  trend  for  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  fever  after  multiple  doses  was  seen  in  both 
studies. In study D-Pan H5N1-032 not only occurrence increased, but also intensity, as no fever ≥39.0˚C 
was seen following dose 1 in the H5_H5 group, but it did occur after dose 2 and 3. 
In children aged ≥6 years of age the most frequently reported systemic solicited AE after the primary 
vaccination with H5N1 vaccine was headache in study D-PAN H5N1-032 (reported after 24.4%-28.2% 
of D-PAN doses in 38.4%-42.1% of subjects). In study Q-Pan H5N1-021 the most frequently reported 
systemic  solicited  AE  was  muscle  ache  reported  in  27.3%  of  doses  in  39.8%  of  subjects, followed  by 
headache reported in 21.4% of doses in 32.4% of subjects. 
In both studies, the most frequently reported grade 3 systemic solicited AE was headache, reported after 
1.3%- 2.0% of doses and fever reported after 0.8%-4.8% of doses 
The  most  frequently  reported  related  systemic  solicited  AEs  was  headache  in  study  D-PAN  H5N1-032 
and muscle ache followed by headache in study Q-Pan H5N1-021. In both studies, headache was the 
most frequently reported grade 3 systemic solicited AE reported by 0.8% to 3.2% of subjects. 
In study D-PAN H5N1-032 an increase in fever was reported after Dose 2 compared to Dose 1, however, 
the incidence of fever was lower after Dose 3 (i.e. a booster 6 months after primary vaccination). 
Overall, these results indicate that Adjupanrix is a reactogenic vaccine, with the majority of participants 
experiencing  at  least  1  solicited  AE.  Reactogenicity  was  higher  compared  to  the  active  comparator 
(Havrix or Havrix junior) and placebo control group. Across studies, the observations about solicited AEs 
were consistent, with the majority of participants experiencing 1 or more solicited AEs and injection-site 
pain being the most frequently reported local solicited AE. In children aged 3 to <6 years of age, the 
dominant  systemic  solicited  AEs  were  irritability/fussiness  and  fever.  Fever  was  the  most  frequently 
reported grade 3 systemic solicited AE and a trend for an increase in the incidence of fever was observed. 
In  children  aged  6years  to  <18  years,  headache  was  the  most  frequently  reported  systemic  AE.  The 
most  frequently  reported  grade  3  systemic  solicited  AE  was  headache,  reported  after  1.3%-  2.0%  of 
doses and fever reported after 0.8%-4.8% of doses. Most AEs were mild to moderate in intensity.

Unsolicited Adverse Events 
The percentage of participants receiving H5N1 vaccine during the primary vaccination series reported at 
least 1 unsolicited AE ranged from 29.5% to 41.0%, of which the most frequently reported unsolicited 
AEs were in the SOC of infections and infestations. Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported in 0.3%-4.8% 
of subjects receiving H5N1 vaccine and 2.5%-6.9% in the placebo/active comparator control group. 
Unsolicited  AEs  with  a  causal  relationship  to  the  study  vaccine,  were  reported  in  3.3%-7.6%  of 
participants  receiving  H5N1  vaccine  and  2.6%-3.8%  in  the  placebo/active  comparator  control  group. 
These numbers appear balanced between the groups. 
In study D-PAN H5N1-032 none of the grade 3 unsolicited AEs were considered related to the vaccine. 
In study Q-PAN H5N1-021 during year 1 and 2, 1 subject reported 2 grade 3 unsolicited AEs in the Q-
PAN group which were considered related to the vaccine: chills and myalgia for year 1 and abdominal 
pain and nausea during year 2.  
Serious Adverse Events and Death 
The percentage of participants experiencing an SAE during study D-PAN H5N1-032 and Q-PAN H5N1-
021 ranged from 1.2% to 2.6%. None were considered related to the vaccine. No deaths occurred during 
the studies. 
Pregnancy 
In total 6 participants in Study D-PAN H5N1-032 (two 15-year old, three 16-year old and one 17-year 
old),  and  2  in  Study  Q-PAN  H5N1-021  (1  17-year  old,  1  unknown),  got  pregnant  after  vaccination 
including Adjupanrix. Of the known infant outcomes, no congenital or other abnormalities were reported. 
These data do not indicate an unusual risk or safety concern; however, exposure to the vaccines in all 
cases was before the pregnancy. Currently, there is no clinical data of the use of these vaccines in women 
who are pregnant.  
Children aged 6 months to <36 months 
Solicited Adverse Events 
In  the  age  group  6  months  to  <36  months,  the  majority  of  subjects,  ranging  from  70.3%  to  94.6%, 
receiving the primary vaccination with H5N1 vaccine, experienced at least 1 AE (solicited or unsolicited). 
Injection site pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE in all doses and all groups.  
Of the subjects receiving a half adult dose (190_B), enrolled in study D-PAN HN1-013, Q-PAN H5N1-023 
and Q-PAN H5N1-021, 74.9% to 94.6% experienced at least 1 AE. A solicited systemic AE was reported 
by 60.8%-89.5% of subjects and a local AE by 42.1%-48.2% of subjects. A grade 3 solicited AE was 
reported by 12.1%-23.7% of subjects of which, 8.5%-18.4% were considered related to the vaccine.  
The local solicited AE of injection pain was reported after >29% of doses and in >42% of subjects. Grade 
3 injection pain was reported after >1.6% of doses in >2.6% of subjects. In study Q-PAN H5N1-021, it 
was  observed  that  Grade  3  injection  site  pain  occurred  at  comparable  frequencies  in  the  Q-PAN  and 
placebo group: Grade 3 pain was reported after 1.6% of doses in 2.6% of subjects from the Q-Pan group 
and 1.4% of doses in 2.7% of subjects in the Placebo group. 
The most frequently reported systemic AE was irritability in studies D-PAN H5N1-013 and Q-PAN H5N1-
021, reported by 44.0%-51.8% of subjects after 31.0%-38.1% of doses. In study Q-PAN H5N1-023, the 
most frequently reported systemic AE was overall per dose drowsiness and irritability (after 40.0% of 
doses) and overall per subject drowsiness and fever, reported by 60.5% of subjects. 
Assessment report  
Page 101/102 
 
 
  
 
Fever was reported by 22.4% to 60.5% of subjects after 12.5% to 38.7% of doses. Grade 3 fever was 
reported after 3.6%-9.3% of doses. Fever was more frequently reported in study Q-PAN H5N1-023, in 
60.5% of subjects after 38.7% of doses, compared to study D-PAN H5N1-013 and Q-PAN H5N1-021, 
reported by 8.0%-33.0% of subjects after 5.0%-20.2% of doses. 
The  most  frequently  reported  systemic  solicited  AE  considered  related  to  the  vaccine  was  irritability, 
reported after 23.0%-38.1% of doses, followed by drowsiness, reported after 18.8%-34.7% of doses, 
and fever, reported after 4.0%-34.7% of doses. The most frequently reported grade 3 related systemic 
AEs were irritability, drowsiness and fever, reported after 1.0%-6.7% of doses. 
Of the subjects receiving a quarter adult dose, 37 subjects in study Q-PAN H5N1-023, 70.3% experienced 
at least 1 AE. A solicited systemic AE was reported by 62.2% of subjects and a local AE by 29.7% of 
subjects. A grade 3 solicited AE was reported by 13.5% of subjects, of which 10.8% were considered 
related to the vaccine. 
The most frequently reported local solicited AE was injection pain reported after 26.0% of the doses and 
in 29.7% of subjects. No grade 3 injection pain was reported. No redness or swelling were reported.  
The most frequently reported systemic AE was drowsiness, reported by 43.2% of subjects after 30.1% 
of doses. Fever was reported by 40.5% of subjects after 15.8% of doses. Grade 3 fever was reported 
after 2.7% of doses in 5.4% of subjects. 
The  most  frequently  reported  systemic  solicited  AE  considered  related  to  the  vaccine  was  irritability, 
reported  after  24.7%  of  doses,  followed  by  drowsiness,  reported  after  23.3%  of  doses.  The  most 
frequently reported grade 3 related systemic AE were drowsiness and fever, both reported after 2.7% 
of doses. 
Overall, these results indicate that Adjupanrix is a reactogenic vaccine in children aged 6 months to <36 
months, with the majority of participants experiencing at least 1 solicited AE. Reactogenicity was slightly 
higher in the half adult dose group compared to the quarter adult dose group.  
Across studies, the observations about solicited AEs were consistent, with the majority of participants 
experiencing  1  or  more  solicited  AEs  and  injection-site  pain  being  the  most  frequently  reported  local 
solicited  AE.  In  children  aged  6  months  to  <36  months,  the  dominant  systemic  solicited  AEs  were 
irritability/fussiness  and  drowsiness.  The  most  frequently  reported  grade  3  systemic  solicited  AE  was 
irritability, drowsiness and fever. Most AEs were mild to moderate in intensity. 
Fever is an AE of concern as fever due to vaccination has been known to lead to febrile seizures. In study 
Q-PAN H5N1-023 Vaccine-related fever occurred in 22 subjects (57.9%) in group 190_B and 12 subjects 
(32.4%) in group 090_C, while Grade 3 fever (39.0-40.0˚C) related to the vaccine occurred in 5 subjects 
(13.2%) in group 190_B and 2 subjects (5.2%) in group 090_C. The mean duration of the fever was 
short (<2 days) for both groups. These results indicate that the incidence of fever is less after a quarter 
dose compared to half adult dose. A post-hoc analysis relying  on comparisons across studies showed 
that incidence of fever in study Q-PAN H5N1-023 was high, as the incidence of fever reported for group 
190_B was higher as compared to the same age group administered the same formulation. The strength 
of evidence achieved using such a post-hoc analysis is  limited, as the groups that are pooled were not 
randomised potentially leading to bias.   
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
The percentage of participants reporting at least 1 unsolicited AE ranged from 49.2% to 68.4%. Of note, 
during year 2 of study Q-PAN H5N1-021 only 26.5% of subjects reported an unsolicited AE. 
Of the subjects receiving a half adult dose (190_B), 49.2%-68.1% experienced at least 1 unsolicited AE, 
with  only  26.5%  of  subjects  reporting  an  unsolicited  AE  during  study  year  2.  The  most  frequently 
Assessment report  
Page 102/103 
 
 
  
 
reported  unsolicited  AEs  were  in  the  system  organ  class  (SOC)  of  infections  and  infestations.  The 
percentage of subjects reporting a vaccine-related unsolicited AE was 3 ranged from 7.5% to 15.9%.  
Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported by 3.0% to 8.8% of subjects. In only 2 cases in the D-PAN H5N1-
013 study (1.8% of subjects) was the grade 3 unsolicited AE related to the vaccine (nasopharyngitis and 
swelling face). None of the other grade 3 unsolicited AEs in the other 2 studies were considered vaccine-
related. 
Of  the  subjects  receiving  a  quarter  adult  dose,  090_C,  20  subjects  (54.1%)  experienced  at  least  1 
unsolicited  AE.  Most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  AEs  were  in  the  system  organ  class  (SOC)  of 
infections and infestations. None of the unsolicited AEs were considered related to the vaccine.  
These results point to a more reactogenic profile when using the half adult dose compared to the quarter 
adult dose, which is expected. It has to be noted that only 37 children were treated with the quarter 
adult dose, which is only enough to pick up the most frequently reported solicited AEs. The MAH was 
asked  to    discuss  the  relationship  of  the  unsolicited  AEs  judged  by  the  investigator  as  related  to  the 
vaccine and add unsolicited vaccine-related AEs to the SmPC. 
Serious Adverse Events and Death 
The  percentage  of  participants  reporting  an  SAE  in study  Q-PAN  H5N1-023  was  relatively  high,  29  of 
185  subjects  (15.7%).  The  percentage  of  participants  experiencing  an  SAE  in  the  quarter  adult  dose 
group was 16.2%. The percentage of participants experiencing an SAE in the half adult dose group was 
13.2%. None of the SAEs were considered related to the vaccine, which is agreed. 
The percentage of participants experiencing an SAE during study D-PAN H5N1-013 and Q-PAN H5N1-
021 ranged from 1.5% to 8.0%. None were considered related to the vaccine, which is agreed.  
No deaths occurred during the studies. 
Narcolepsy 
An increase in relative risk of narcolepsy in those vaccinated with Pandemrix (H1N1-AS03 adjuvanted 
pandemic influenza vaccine) compared to those unvaccinated, especially in the younger population, has 
been observed. However, increased incidences of narcolepsy have been observed following H1N1pdm09 
virus circulation not associated with Pandemrix vaccination, indicating that influenza infection can be a 
confounder.   
A  current  hypothesis  is  that  molecular  mimicry  between  H1N1pdm09  influenza  HA  peptide  and  HCRT 
could play a role in the development of narcolepsy. Cross-reactive CD4 T have been shown to occur that 
recognize  both  peptides  originating  from  A/H1N1pdm09  influenza  proteins  as  well  as  peptides  from 
proteins  produced  by  (HCRT)-secreting  neurons,  which  could  ultimately  leads  to  the  destruction  of 
hypocretin secreting neurons. The peptides that induced cross-reactivity once bound to the HLA groove 
looked very similar, giving credence to the molecular mimicry hypothesis. However,  the fact that cross-
reactive T-cells were found in both narcoleptic and not-narcoleptic individuals, means that having cross-
reactive  T-cells  is  not  enough.  This  inspired  the  “double-hit”  hypothesis,  which  could  explain  the 
involvement of natural infection and why narcolepsy is so specifically increased after vaccination with 
Pandemrix.  
The molecular mimicry hypothesis seems plausible, however it is still a hypothesis and other mechanisms 
should  not  be  ignored.  This  does  indicate  that  the  MAH  should  continue  their  research  into  biological 
mechanism to how the cross-reactive CD4 T-cells and potentially CD8 T-cells are involved in the aetiology 
of narcolepsy. In addition, the MAH should ensure that the type of peptides that can cause cross-reactive 
T-cells will be investigated further. The MAH stated that if an influenza pandemic is declared and the 
Influenza strain identified, the research plan would then be to identify the corresponding putative cross-

reactive  pHA1275-287  sequence  and  assess  the  probability  of  the  peptide  to  bind  DQ0602  based  on 
amino  acid  sequence  using  bioinformatic  tools.  In  addition,  the  MAH  is  further  investigating  the 
theoretical possibility of molecular mimicry of Pandemrix leading to narcolepsy using a novel transgenic 
animal model, which is appreciated.    
Considering  the  seriousness  of  this  theoretical  risk,  the  MAH  has  committed  to  closely  monitoring 
narcolepsy  should  the  product  be  used  in  a  situation  of  mass  immunisation,  such  as  a next  influenza 
pandemic. The MAH actively searches for relevant published data regarding the incidence of narcolepsy 
and incorporates this information within currently existing background incidence rates of narcolepsy. In 
addition, the MAH is aware of the potential bias induced by narcolepsy referral and diagnosis processes 
and difference in media interest and/or public perceptions and will endeavour to account for these at 
time of analysis. 
Concomitant medication 
The majority of participants receiving H5N1 vaccination in all studies received concomitant medications, 
ranging  from  54.4%-89.4%,  of  which  37.2%-79.6%  received  antipyretics.  Of  the  subjects  in  the 
placebo/active  comparator  group,  47.4%-58.7%  of  subjects  received  concomitant  medications  and 
26.3%-48.1% used antipyretics. 
Of  the  subjects  receiving  a  half  adult  dose  (190_B)  in  the  6  Months  to  <36  month  old  age  category, 
62.3%-89.4% received concomitant medication and 47.7%-79.6% received antipyretics. None to 4.4% 
of subjects received prophylactic antipyretics. A trend towards increased use of concomitant medication 
and antipyretics was seen in subjects using half adult dose. Of the subjects receiving a  quarter adult 
dose, 090_C, 59.5% received concomitant medication and 45.9% received antipyretics. None received 
prophylactic antipyretics. 
The results indicate that over all studies, the majority of subjects receiving H5N1 primary vaccination 
also received concomitant medication. A large portion of the subjects received antipyretics, indicating 
that fever is an important AE. In the 6 month to <36 month old age category, when using the half adult 
dose a trend towards increased antipyretics was seen, which was not present in the group administered 
a quarter adult dose.  
Discontinuation due to AE 
In total, only 1 participant experienced an AE that led to study vaccine discontinuation. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety concerns arose during the studies in children. The safety profile of Adjupanrix is dominated 
by  solicited  AEs.  Injection  site  pain  was  the  most  commonly  reported  local  solicited  AE.  The  most 
frequently  reported  systemic  solicited  AE  depends  on  the  age  category,  with  irritability/fussiness  and 
drowsiness  being  most 
frequently  reported  by  children  aged  6  months  to  <36  months, 
irritability/fussiness and fever in children aged 3 years to <6 years and headache in children 6 years to 
<18  years.  Most  AEs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity.  None  of  the  SAEs  that  occurred  during  the 
studies were related to the vaccine. 
The quarter adult dose was found to be slightly less reactogenic compared to half adult dose. A decrease 
in incidence of fever of approximately 50% was seen in study Q-PAN H5N1-023. 
As there is a theoretical risk of narcolepsy with AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines in children, the MAH

committed    to  closely  monitoring  narcolepsy  should  the  product  be  used  in  a  situation  of  mass 
immunisation, such as a next influenza pandemic. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 13.2 with this application.  
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 13.2 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 13.2 with the following content: 
Part I – PRODUCT OVERVIEW  
In Table Product Overview, Indication(s) and module Dosage in EEA were updated with the paediatric 
population from 6 months of age.  
Part II – SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Module SI Epidemiology of the indication(s) and target population(s) was updated with general 
updates and the updated indication.  
Module SVII.2 New safety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an updated RMP: deleted 
text, risks reclassified in previous version, however no changes to this version.  
Please note that during the Adjupanrix renewal procedure (EMEA/H/C/001206/R/0062, finalized 29 
May 2019) the RMP was updated to comply with GVP Module V rev 2, hence the safety concerns 
‘Vaccination failure/ vaccine effectiveness’, ‘Fever’, ‘Medical errors/ misidentification of vaccine’ and 
‘Coring of the rubber stopper on the vial’ and ‘Contamination of multiple-dose vials’ were removed 
from the RMP. 
Module SVII.3.1. Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks: updated table

III.1.2 Spontaneous reporting 
Enhanced passive surveillance 
GSK Biologicals performs close monitoring of GBS, thrombocytopenia, and sudden unexplained infant 
death reported to occur following the administration of any GSK vaccine. For Adjupanrix, GSK 
Biologicals will perform close monitoring of the three events listed above plus the events designated as 
AESIs in the CHMP recommendations for the PhV plans of pandemic influenza vaccines 
(EMEA/359381/2009). The additional AESIs include anaphylaxis, Bell’s palsy, convulsion, 
demyelinating disorders, encephalitis, neuritis and vasculitis. Close monitoring will also be performed 
for AIH, increased aminotransferase concentrations and narcolepsy. For all events subject to close 
monitoring, targeted questionnaires will be used in order to maximise the consistent documentation of 
the case reports.

III.1.3 Periodic safety update reports 
In order to effectively monitor the safety profile of Adjupanrix during an officially declared H5N1 
influenza pandemic, GSK Biologicals will prepare monthly simplified PSURs, accompanied by a 
summary of vaccine distribution, as described in the CHMP recommendations for PhV plans of 
pandemic influenza vaccines (EMEA/359381/2009). The preparation and submission of the safety 
reports are described in detail in this section and in Annex IIC (Other conditions and requirements of 
the marketing authorisation).  
Objectives of the simplified PSUR 
The objectives of the simplified PSUR, as indicated by CHMP, include the following: 
• 
• 
To notify regulatory authorities of the AERs that have been received within a pre-specified time 
period and that may have the greatest implications for risk-benefit balance in a pandemic; 
To flag any preliminary safety concerns and prioritise them for further evaluation within an 
appropriate timeframe. 
Frequency of submission 
• 
• 
The clock will start on the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine. 
First data-lock point is 28 days later. 
•  Report submission will be no later than day 43 (15 days after data-lock point), as agreed with 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) during the H1N1 influenza pandemic, because Day 14 after 
data-lock point will always fall on a Sunday. 
•  Reports will be submitted monthly for the first 6 months of the pandemic. 
• 
Periodicity will be reviewed by GSK Biologicals and the (Co-)Rapporteur at 6-month intervals. 
Format of the simplified PSUR 
The report will include the following tables of aggregate data, using the format specified in the CHMP 
recommendations (EMEA/359381/2009) in the order listed below: 
1.  An overview for all spontaneous reports per country, stratified according to type of report 
(medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed) and seriousness, for the period covered by the 
report and cumulatively. 
2.  An overview for all spontaneous adverse events by SOC, High Level Term (HLT), and PT, stratified 
according to type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed) and including the 
number of fatal reports, for the period covered by the report and cumulatively. 
3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed or non-
medically confirmed). AESIs will be defined as follows: 
o  Neuritis: PT “Neuritis”. 
o  Convulsion: narrow standardised MedDRA query (SMQ) “Convulsions”. 
o  Anaphylaxis: narrow SMQ “Anaphylactic reaction” and narrow SMQ “Angioedema”. 
o  Encephalitis: narrow SMQ “Non-infectious encephalitis.”  
o  Vasculitis: narrow SMQ “Vasculitis”. 
o  Guillain-Barré syndrome: narrow SMQ “Guillain-Barré syndrome” (the PTs ‘Chronic 
inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy’ and ‘Demyelinating polyneuropathy’ 
will be tabulated in the “Demyelination” category). 
o  Demyelination: narrow SMQ “Demyelination” (as GBS is also included in this SMQ, there 
will be an overlap in the number of cases for these 2 categories). 
o  Bell’s palsy: PT “Bell’s Palsy” 
o  Narcolepsy: PT Narcolepsy; SMQ “Convulsions,” SMQ “Generalised convulsive seizures 
following immunisation,” SMQ “Immune-mediated/autoimmune disorders” 
o  Autoimmune hepatitis: PT “Autoimmune hepatitis,” SMQ “Immune-mediated autoimmune 
disorders” 
Increased concentrations of hepatic enzymes: PT “Hepatic enzyme increased,” SMQ “Liver 
related investigations, signs and symptoms”   
o 
o  Potential immune-mediated diseases: GSKMQ_pIMD (see Annex 9 for complete list) 
4.  Serious unlisted adverse reactions (SOC, HLT, PTs) stratified according to type of report (medically 
confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period covered by the report and cumulatively. 
Assessment report  
Page 107/108 
 
 
  
 
 
5.  All spontaneous adverse reactions by age group, per SOC, HLT and PT, stratified according to type 
of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period covered by the report 
and cumulatively. The following age groups will be used: <2 years, 2 to 8 years, ≥9 years, and age 
unknown. 
6.  All spontaneous adverse reactions (SOC, HLT, PT) occurring in pregnant women, stratified 
according to type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period 
covered by the report and cumulatively. 
The following principles will be followed when compiling the data: 
• 
Table 1 of the PSUR will be based on the number of reports, while all other tables will be based on 
number of reactions (presented on PT level, sorted by SOC and HLT). 
•  All tables will be based on generic and not product-specific data, based on the assumption that 
product name will not be provided in a significant proportion of cases. Product-specific data will be 
evaluated during signal evaluation. 
• 
“Cumulatively” means all adverse events since the use of the vaccine. 
•  All non-medically confirmed events will be those that had been entered into GSK’s worldwide 
clinical safety database (referred to as ARGUS) by the data-lock point. Those which have not yet 
been entered will be reported in subsequent simplified PSURs. 
• 
“Serious” refers to the seriousness using regulatory criteria based on outcomes; this definition will 
be used in all tables. 
•  CIOMS I forms for fatal cases and reports of GBS will be provided in annexes. 
A short summary will be provided in which the total number of new AERs since the last simplified PSUR 
will be outlined and validated signals and areas of concern will be highlighted, signal evaluation 
prioritised (in the event of multiple signals), and appropriate timelines for submission of a full signal 
evaluation report provided. 
Signals occurring in pregnant women will be summarised in a table that will include the following data 
elements: gestational age at time of vaccination, gestational age at time of occurrence of adverse 
event, adverse event, and outcome. 
Vaccine distribution report 
To put the safety report into context, a summary of vaccine distribution will be included and will 
provide details of the number of doses of vaccine distributed in 
i)  EU member states for the reporting period by batch number, 
ii)  EU member states cumulatively and 
iii)  the rest of the world. 
Upon request narcolepsy has been included as AESI.

Background incidence of narcolepsy per narcolepsy type, per age cohort, and per HLA haplotype should 
be clear in a pre-pandemic situation. The MAH will take genetic factors, such as HLA type, influence 
the susceptibility of individuals to narcolepsy, as well as that the prevalence and incidence estimates 
may vary by methodology and populations tested (e.g., age), into account when establishing a 
background incidence rate. In addition, the MAH, will pro-active process for identifying potential safety 
signals with several components; systematic and regular review of the literature is a key component of 
these pharmacovigilance activities. When relevant data regarding the incidence of narcolepsy is 
published, this information is incorporated within currently existing background IRs, to continuously 
assess the benefit/risk profile of GSK vaccines for which narcolepsy adverse events have been 
reported.

Paediatric population 
Children aged 6 months to <36 months: 
One dose of 0.125 ml (equals quarter the adult dose per injection) at an elected date. 
A second dose of 0.125 ml at least three weeks after the first dose for maximum efficacy. 
Children and adolescents aged 36 months to <18 years: 
One dose of 0.25 ml (equals half the adult dose per injection) at an elected date. 
A second dose of 0.25 ml at least three weeks after the first dose for maximum efficacy. 
Children aged <6 months: 
The safety and efficacy of Adjupanrix in children less than 6 months have not been 
established. 
There are limited safety and immunogenicity data available on the administration of Adjupanrix and on 
administration of half a dose of the vaccine (i.e. 1.875 µg HA and half the amount of AS03 adjuvant) 
at 0 and 21 days in children aged 3 to 9 years.   
Currently available data are described in section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the 
product is not commercialised, changes are minimal. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Influenza usually occurs in winter outbreaks or epidemics (in temperate climates). People of all ages are 
afflicted, but the prevalence is greatest in school-age children; disease severity is greatest in infants, 
the aged, and those with underlying illnesses. 
Assessment report  
Page 110/111 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An  influenza  pandemic  is  a  global  outbreak  of  influenza  disease  that  occurs  when  a  type  A  influenza 
strain to which most or all humans are immunologically naïve emerges to cause clinically apparent illness, 
and  then  spreads  easily  from  person  to  person  worldwide.  This  can  result  in  simultaneous  epidemic 
disease  in  many  locations  worldwide,  with  substantial  number  of  deaths  and  illnesses.  Preceding  the 
2009 H1N1 pandemic, the last century witnessed three influenza pandemics, the "Spanish Flu" in 1918–
1919, the "Asian Flu" in 1957 and the "Hong Kong Flu" in 1968 [Kilbourne, 2006] - all arising from avian 
influenza viruses. 
Influenza pandemics are unpredictable and occur infrequently but have consequences on human health 
and  economic  well-being  (WHO,  2017).  Previous  experience  with  the  2009  swine-origin  influenza 
A(H1N1) pandemic showed that children were the most affected age category (Jain, 2009; Miller, 2010), 
probably due to higher exposure in schools or the lack of pre-existing immunity as seen in the elderly, 
who have likely encountered the virus earlier in life (Cobey, 2017). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Vaccination is the most effective way of preventing and controlling the spread of influenza in the human 
population. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK) has developed H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccines. GSK 
manufactures split virion seasonal influenza vaccines at two GSK facilities, one in Dresden Germany and 
the other in Québec Canada (the subsequent vaccines are indicated with the prefix D and Q respectively). 
The pandemic vaccine H5N1 split virus antigens are produced using a process similar to that used for 
the production of seasonal influenza vaccine and are adjuvanted with GSK’s AS03 adjuvant system. 
Of note, the vaccine used during the studies will not be deployed during a pandemic. It is considered a 
“mock-up” vaccine. During an officially declared pandemic, the pandemic strain will be included in the 
vaccine. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical trials to support dosing regimens in children aged 6 to <36 months and 3 to <18 years 
were Q-PAN H5N1-023 and D-PAN H5N1-032 respectively.  
Study D-PAN H5N1-032 was a phase III, single-centre, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, prime-
boost study, enrolling healthy children aged 3 to 17 years old. Children were randomised to receive 2 
doses  containing  1.9 µg  HA  antigen/AS03B  (half  adult  dose)  or  comparator  vaccine  (Havrix/Havrix 
junior).  The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  superiority  of  the  HI  antibody  response  against 
A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (H5N1) 10 days following a booster dose (1.9 μg A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 
[H5N1] HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03B) on Day 182 in subjects previously primed with two doses of 
heterologous  A/Indonesia/5/2005  (H5N1)  vaccine  versus  non  primed  subjects.  Criterion  used:  lower 
limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the HI GMT ratio on Day 192 (Group H5N1_H5N1 
compared to Group Havrix_H5N1) was greater than 1.0. 
Study Q-PAN H5N1-023, is a Phase II, observer-blind, randomized, dose-ranging study enrolling healthy 
children aged 6 and 35 months (inclusive) at time of first vaccination. Q-PAN H5N1-023 investigated a 
range of doses including a quarter and half adult dose. The co-primary objectives of the study were to 
assess  the  performance  of  alternative  dosing  regimens  for  primary  immunization  with  Q-Pan  H5N1 
vaccine using an immunogenicity-fever index that considers immunogenicity by HI assay / MN assay 21 
days after the second priming dose and fever scores after the first and second priming doses, and to 
assess  the  performance  of  dosing  regimens  for  booster  immunization  with  Q-Pan  H5N1  vaccine 
Assessment report

considering immune response by HI / MN assay 7 days after a 12 month booster dose of 3.75 μg HA Q-
Pan H5N1 unadjuvanted antigen. As this is the only study providing information on a quarter dose (0.9 
µg HA antigen/AS03B), this study is considered pivotal. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Children aged 6 months to <36 months 
Homologous immune response. At 21 days after primary vaccination SCR and VRR were 100% in all 
dose  groups.  HI  and  MN  GMTs  were  numerically  higher  in  the  half  adult  dose  group  (1118.6  [884.4-
1414.9]  and  1498.5  [1181.7-1900.1]  respectively)  compared  to  the  quarter  adult  dose  group  (858.8 
[659.2-1118.8] and  1214.3 [921.3-1600.6] respectively). Both HI and MN antibodies persisted for at 
least 12 months as they remained substantially above baseline for both quarter adult dose and half adult 
dose,  leading  to  SCR  of  78.8%  (61.1%-91.0%)  and  97.1%  (84.7%-99.9%)  respectively  and  VRR  of 
100% (100% [89.1-100] and 100% [89.7-100] respectively).  
Heterologous  immune  response.  At  21  days  after  primary  vaccination  SCR  and  VRR  were  slightly 
higher  in  the  half  adult  dose  group  compared  to  the  quarter  adult  dose  group,  100%  (88.4-100  and 
89.7-100) for both in the half adult dose vs 91.7% (73.0-99.0) and 96.9% (83.8-99.9) for SCR and VRR 
respectively in the quarter adult dose. Both HI and MN antibodies persisted for at least 12 months as 
they remained above baseline for both quarter adult dose and half adult dose, leading to SCR of 27.6% 
(12.7-47.2) and 38.7% (21.8-57.8) respectively and VRR of 84.4% (67.2-94.7) and 87.1% (70.2-96.4). 
At 12 months MGI was higher in the half adult dose compared to the quarter dose for both HI (4.7 [3.5-
6.2] and 4.1 [4.2-8.1] respectively) and MN (7.6 [5.5-10.3] and 5.8 [4.2-8.1] respectively) antibodies.  
Effect of boost. A booster dose of unadjuvanted vaccine 1 year after the primary vaccination was able 
to elicit an immune response in all groups. An anamnestic primary vaccine-homologous HI response was 
seen at 7 days after the boost SCR was 100% in both quarter adult dose and half adult dose groups. 
Heterologous HI antibodies were also elicited, leading to an SCR of 100% (88.1-100) in the quarter adult 
dose and 96.7% (82.8-99.9) in the half adult dose. The anamnestic response seen for MN antibodies 
yielded a VRR of 100% for vaccine-homologous MN antibodies and 96.9% for vaccine-heterologous MN 
antibodies in both groups. 
Children aged 3 years to <18 years 
Homologous  immune  response.  At  21  days  after  primary  vaccination  SCR  and  VRR  were  99.3% 
(96.4-100)  -  99.4%  (96.5-100)  and  98.7%  (95.4-99.8)  respectively  in  the  groups  receiving  H5N1 
primary vaccination. In unprimed individuals, SCR was 1.0% (0.0-5.3 and 0.0-5.4) and VRR ranged from 
0.0-2.0%.  Both  HI  and  MN  antibodies  persisted  for  at  least  6  months  as  they  remained  substantially 
above baseline for both primed groups, leading to SCR of 78.7% (71.4-84.9) and 79.6% (72.3-85.7) 
respectively  and  VRR  of  79.7%  (72.5-85.8)  to  85.7%  (79.2-90.8).  In  unprimed  individuals,  numbers 
remained similar to baseline levels. 
Heterologous  immune  response.  At  21  days  after  primary  vaccination  vaccine-heterologous  HI 
response  was  robust,  leading  to  SCR  ranging  from  98.0%  (94.3-99.8)  to  98.7%  (95.4-99.8)  in  the 
primed individuals, while in unprimed individuals SCR was 3.9% (1.1-9.6) to 4.0% (1.1-9.8). Vaccine-
heterologous  HI  antibodies  declined  over  time,  but  persisted  for  at  least  6  months  as  they  remained 
above baseline for the primed individuals leading to an SCR of 48.4% (40.3-56.5) to 66.4% (58.3-73.9). 
In unprimed individuals, SCR at 6 months after primary vaccination ranged from 1.0% (0.0-5.3) to 2.0% 
(0.2-7.0).

Effect  of  boost.  Both  primed  and  unprimed  individuals  showed  an  increase  in  H5N1/turkey  HI  GMT 
after the booster vaccination with H5N1/turkey, however, the response was significantly higher in the 
primed individuals, indicating the presence of an anamnestic immune response to an antigenically drifted 
strain after primary vaccination with H5N1/Indonesia. The response was higher compared to the primary 
response.  In  group  without  primary  vaccination  series,  10  days  after  the  heterologous  booster  dose 
A/Indonesia HI antibody response as measured by GMTs, SCR and MGI increased only slightly. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Efficacy/effectiveness  data.  No  efficacy  or  effectiveness  data  is  available  for  Adjupanrix.  The 
evaluation of the vaccine regimen is based on immunogenicity data.  
Correlate of protection. Both HI and MN titers were measured, but as there is no cut-off value known 
that  can  be  associated  with  clinical  benefit  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  responses  and 
differences between different doses and timepoints or strains is not entirely clear. 
Children with immune deficiencies. No efficacy or immunogenicity data are available in children with 
immune deficiencies. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Children aged 6 months to <36 months receiving quarter dose 
The incidence of solicited AEs, vaccine-related Grade 3 solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs was higher in 
group 190_B, half adult dose, compared to 090_C, quarter adult dose. 
Of the subjects receiving a quarter adult dose, 70.3% experienced at least 1 AE. A solicited systemic 
AE was reported by 62.2% of subjects and a local AE by 29.7% of subjects. A grade 3 solicited AE was 
reported by 13.5% of subjects, of which 10.8% were considered related to the vaccine. 
The most frequently reported local solicited AE was injection pain reported after 26.0% of the doses and 
in 29.7% of subjects. No grade 3 injection pain was reported. No redness or swelling were reported.  
The most frequently reported systemic AE was drowsiness, reported by 43.2% of subjects after 30.1% 
of doses. Fever was reported by 40.5% of subjects after 15.8% of doses. Grade 3 fever was reported 
after 2.7% of doses in 5.4% of subjects. 
The  most  frequently  reported  systemic  solicited  AE  considered  related  to  the  vaccine  was  irritability, 
reported  after  24.7%  of  doses,  followed  by  drowsiness,  reported  after  23.3%  of  doses.  The  most 
frequently reported grade 3 related systemic AE were drowsiness and fever, both reported after 2.7% 
of doses. 
There were no SAEs related to Adjupanrix or deaths. One subject discontinued the study treatment due 
to an AE: 1 subject in the 190_B group experienced injection-site pain that led to withdrawal. 
Children aged 3 years to <17 years receiving half adult dose 
Adjupanrix is a reactogenic vaccine, with the majority of participants experiencing at least 1 solicited AE 
78.8% to 88.5% following the primary vaccination. Reactogenicity was higher compared to the active 
comparator and placebo control groups, which reported experiencing at least 1 solicited AE by 47.5% to 
76.0% of subjects.  
Assessment report  
Page 113/114 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Across studies, the observations about solicited AEs were consistent, with the majority of participants 
experiencing  1  or  more  solicited  AEs  and  injection-site  pain  being  the  most  frequently  reported  local 
solicited AE, being reported by 70.5%-82.7% of subjects. Most AEs were mild to moderate in intensity. 
In children aged 3 to <6 years of age, the dominant systemic solicited AEs were irritability/fussiness 
and fever reported by 22.4% and 23.3%-35.5% of subjects respectively. Fever was the most frequently 
reported grade 3 systemic solicited AE, reported by 2.0%-6.7% of subjects, and a trend for an increase 
in the incidence of fever with increasing number of doses was observed.  
In children aged 6 years to <18 years, the most frequently reported systemic AE were headache and 
muscle ache reported by 32.4%-42.1% and 15.9%-39.8% of subjects respectively. The most frequently 
reported  grade  3  systemic  solicited  AE  was  headache,  reported  after  1.3%-  2.0%  of  doses  and  fever 
reported after 0.8%-4.8% of doses.  
There were no SAEs related to Adjupanrix or deaths. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Narcolepsy. As Pandemrix, a H1N1pdm09 vaccine using an identical vaccine platform, was associated 
with an increased risk of narcolepsy in children following vaccination, a theoretical risk exists that this 
will also occur using Adjupanrix. In the various studies, the relative risk estimates of narcolepsy 
following vaccination with Pandemrix ranged from 1.5 to 25.0 (95% CI range: 0.3 to 48.5) in children 
Safety database. In total, 1,372 subjects received A/Indonesia containing H5N1 vaccine during the 
primary vaccination series. The size of the safety database limits the detection of more rare adverse 
events. Information on rare but serious AEs should be systematically collected post-licensure. Since 
the dose selected for children aged 6 months to <36 months is a quarter dose, which has only been 
investigated in 37 children, the safety database is extremely limited. However, data obtained with a 
higher dose (half adult dose) in this age group, given to n=350 children aged 6 to <36 months are 
considered supportive for the safety of the lower dose.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In all studies, using all doses, Adjupanrix was found to be highly immunogenic, especially at Day 42, 21 
days after primary vaccination, which is considered most relevant for a pandemic vaccine. The fact that 
cross-reactive HI and MN antibodies are robustly elicited is considered relevant, as influenza is known 
to mutate quickly therefore there is a risk of antigenic drift of a pandemic influenza virus after it starts 
circulating  in  the  population.  In  addition,  6  months  after  the  primary  vaccination,  a  boost  using  a 
heterologous vaccine is able to elicit an anamnestic response, which was greater than the response to 
the primary vaccination. One year after the primary vaccination, a boost using an unadjuvanted vaccine, 
still was able to elicit an immune response, however, this was lower compared to the primary response.  
Across all age groups and doses, the majority of participants experienced local and systemic AEs. Most 
of the solicited AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity.  
As previously concluded by the VWP, the data support use of half the adult dose down to 3 years of age, 
as the immune response is robust and safety profile acceptable. 
Dose selection for children aged 6 months to <36 months 
The MAH proposes a half adult dose for children aged 6 to 36 months, and has performed several studies 
with the half dose in this age group. However, PDCO requested further dosefinding in this age group due 
to concerns surrounding the relatively high reactogenicity. In the dose ranging study Q-PAN H5N1-023 
the MAH compared the responses to half adult dose (190_B), quarter adult dose (090-C), half adult dose 
with less adjuvant (190_C), full adult dose with less adjuvant (375_C) and full adult dose (375_D) in a 
single study.   
At  21  days  after  vaccination,  a  numerically  lower  vaccine-homologous  GMT  response  was  seen  when 
using the quarter adult dose (GMT 858.8 [659.2-1118.8]) compared to the half adult dose (GMT 1118.6 
[884.4-1414.9]), however SCR was 100% using both doses. The vaccine-homologous immune response 
shortly  after  vaccination  could  be  considered  the  most  relevant  in  a  pandemic  setting,  as  the  goal  of 
vaccination is to induce an immune response quickly. The immunogenicity data showed that a quarter 
adult dose was only slightly less immunogenic compared to a half adult dose in the 6 month to 36 month 
old age category, as 95% CI of the GMTs overlap at Day 42. As there is no correlate of protection, the 
clinical relevance of this slight decrease in immunogenicity is unknown. However, considering the fact 
that  study  Q-PAN  H5N1-021  showed  that  the  immune  response  was  highest  in  the  6  month  to  <36 
month age category when compared to 3 years to <9 years and 9 year to <18 year old age category, 
the slightly reduced immunogenicity when using the quarter dose in this age category is considered of 
limited relevance.  
The safety profile is better when using the quarter adult dose (090_C) compared to the half adult dose 
(190_B). Injection site pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE, reported by 42.1% of 
subjects in the half adult dose group and 29.7% of subjects in the quarter adult dose group in study Q-
PAN H5N1-023. The most frequently reported systemic solicited AEs in the half adult dose group were 
drowsiness  and  fever,  both  reported  by  60.5%  of  subjects  and  drowsiness  in  the  quarter  adult  dose 
group reported by 43.2% of subjects. Vaccine-related fever occurred in 22 subjects (57.9%) in group 
190_B  and  12  subjects  (32.4%)  in  group  090_C.  Grade  3  fever  (39.0-40.0˚C)  related  to  the  vaccine 
occurred in 5 subjects (13.2%) in group 190_B and 2 subjects (5.2%) in group 090_C.  
Based  on  the  fact  that  the  slightly  reduced  immunogenicity  when  using  the  quarter  dose  in  this  age 
category  could  be  acceptable  considering  the  improved  safety  profile  overall,  the  quarter  dose  is

recommended in children aged 6 months to <36 months. The MAH was requested to update the posology 
in children aged 6 months to 36 months at time of first vaccination to a quarter adult dose . This also 
affected the data to be presented in section 5.1. 
This  conclusion  is  in  line  with  previous  advice  from  VWP  given  in  relation  to  scientific  advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/3998/1/2018/PED/II). In infants and toddler from 6 months to 36 months of age the VWP 
concluded  that  a  quarter  adult  dose  may  be  preferable  since  it  seemed  sufficiently  immunogenic 
(including in cross-immunogenicity studies) and had a slightly better safety profile than the half adult 
dose. In addition, the VWP concluded that a further study of the quarter adult dose in this age was not 
required as the data would be sufficient to conclude on a posology. When deciding this, the VWP took 
into  account  the  ethical  controversies  around  vaccinating  children  with  H5N1  in  lack  of  an  imminent 
threat. 
Narcolepsy 
Pandemrix has been associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy, especially in the young population. 
Considering the fact that Pandemrix uses the same platform as Adjupanrix and a definite cause has not 
been identified for the increased risk, a theoretical risk exist that Adjupanrix could also be associated 
with an increased risk.  
A current plausible hypothesis is that molecular mimicry between H1N1pdm09 influenza HA peptide 
and HCRT could play a role in the development of narcolepsy. Cross-reactive CD4 T have been shown 
to occur that recognize both peptides originating from A/H1N1pdm09 influenza proteins as well as 
peptides from proteins produced by (HCRT)-secreting neurons and once bound to the HLA groove both 
peptides looked very similar. The MAH will continue their research into biological mechanism to how 
the cross-reactive CD4 T-cells and potentially CD8 T-cells are involved in the aetiology of narcolepsy 
using a novel transgenic animal model. In addition, once an influenza pandemic is declared, the 
influenza strain will be investigated to determine whether putative cross-reactive pHA1275-287 
sequence is present and assess the probability of the peptide binding to DQ0602 using bioinformatic 
tools. .    
Considering  the  seriousness  of  this  theoretical  risk,  the  MAH  has  committed  to  closely  monitoring 
narcolepsy  should  a  pandemic  vaccine  be  used  in  a  situation  of  mass  immunisation,  such  as  a  next 
influenza pandemic. The MAH actively searches for relevant published data regarding the incidence of 
narcolepsy  and  incorporates  this  information  within  currently  existing  background  incidence  rates  of 
narcolepsy to be able to assess the benefit/risk profile of Adjupanrix. A warning has been included in 
section 4.4 which will create alertness to the potential risk. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Adjupanrix elicits a robust immune response, as measured by an increase in both vaccine-homologous 
HI and MN antibodies.  
The data support use of half the adult dose proposed by the MAH down to 3 years of age, as the immune 
response is robust and safety profile acceptable.  
In infants and toddler from 6 months to 36 months of age, a quarter adult dose is preferable since it 
seems sufficiently immunogenic (including in cross-immunogenicity studies) and had a better safety 
profile than the half adult dose

the safety and immunogenicity in children aged 6 to 35 months and study H5N1-032, a phase III, 
randomized, open, active-controlled study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity in children aged 
3 to 17 years. As a consequence, sections, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated and the 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Section 4.4 has also been updated with information on 
sodium and potassium content in line with the excipients guideline, as well as to add wording on 
traceability. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet. Furthermore, Annex II C has been updated regarding PSUR frequency of submission 
and format of the ‘simplified PSUR’ and Vaccine distribution report, the PI has been brought in line with 
the latest QRD template version 10.2, and the MAH performed minor editorial changes and removed 
information related to the withdrawn of the Prepandrix marketing authorisation. Version 13.2 of the 
RMP has been agreed with this procedure. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling, Annex II, 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II, IIIA and IIIB and to 
the Risk Management Plan are recommended.

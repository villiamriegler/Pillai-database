CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Skilarence is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults in need of 
systemic medicinal therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Skilarence is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis. 
Posology 
To improve tolerability of Skilarence, it is recommended to begin treatment with a low initial dose 
with subsequent gradual increases. In the first week, a 30 mg dose is taken once daily (1 tablet in the 
evening). In the second week, a 30 mg dose is taken twice daily (1 tablet in the morning and 1 in the 
evening). In the third week, a 30 mg dose is taken three times daily (1 tablet in the morning, 1 at 
midday, and 1 in the evening). From the fourth week, treatment is switched to only 1 tablet of 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a 120 mg dose in the evening. This dose is then increased by one 120 mg tablet per week at different 
times of day for the subsequent 5 weeks, as shown in the table below.  
The maximum daily dose allowed is 720 mg (six 120 mg tablets).

If a particular dose increase is not tolerated, it may be temporarily reduced to the last tolerated dose. 
If treatment success is observed before the maximum dose is reached, no further increase of dose is 
necessary. After clinically relevant improvement of the skin lesions has been achieved, consideration 
should be given to gradual reduction of the daily dose of Skilarence to the maintenance dose required 
by the individual. 
Dose modifications may also be necessary if abnormalities in laboratory parameters are observed (see 
section 4.4). 
Elderly patients 
Clinical studies of Skilarence did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and above 
to determine whether they respond differently compared to patients under 65 years (see section 5.2). 
Based on the pharmacology of dimethyl fumarate, a need for dose adjustment in the elderly is not 
expected. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Skilarence has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment, and use of Skilarence is 
contraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Skilarence has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and use of Skilarence is 
contraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Skilarence in children below the age of 18 years have not been established. 
There are no data available with Skilarence in paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Tablets must be swallowed whole with fluid during or immediately after a meal. 
The coating of the gastro-resistant tablets is designed to prevent gastric irritation. Therefore, the tablets 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should not be crushed, divided, dissolved or chewed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
‒ 
‒ 
‒ 
‒ 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe gastrointestinal disorders. 
Severe hepatic or renal impairment. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haematology 
Skilarence may decrease leukocyte and lymphocyte counts (see section 4.8). It has not been studied in 
patients with pre-existing low leukocyte or lymphocyte counts. 
Before treatment 
Prior to initiating treatment, a current complete blood count (including differential blood count and 
platelet count) should be available. Treatment should not be initiated if leukopenia below 3.0x109/L, 
lymphopenia below 1.0x109/L or other pathological results are identified. 
During treatment 
During treatment, a complete blood count with differential should be performed every 3 months. 
Action is needed in the following circumstances: 
Leukopenia 
If a marked decrease in the total number of white blood cells is found, the situation should be 
monitored carefully and treatment should be discontinued at levels below 3.0x109/L. 
Lymphopenia 
If the lymphocyte count falls below 1.0x109/L but is ≥ 0.7 x109/L, blood monitoring should be 
performed monthly until levels return to 1.0x109/L or higher for two consecutive blood tests at which 
point monitoring can again be performed every 3 months. 
If the lymphocyte count falls below 0.7x109/L, the blood test must be repeated and if the levels are 
confirmed to be below 0.7x109/L, then treatment must be stopped immediately. Patients developing 
lymphopenia should be monitored after stopping treatment until their lymphocyte count has returned 
to the normal range (see section 4.8). 
Other haematological disorders 
Therapy should be discontinued and caution is advised if other pathological results occur. In any case, 
blood counts should be monitored until values have returned to the normal range. 
Infections 
Skilarence is an immunomodulator and may affect the way the immune system responds to infection. 
For patients with pre-existing infections of clinical relevance, the physician should decide if treatment 
should only be initiated once the infection has resolved. If a patient develops an infection during 
treatment, suspension of treatment should be considered and the benefits and risks should be 
reassessed prior to re-initiation of therapy. Patients receiving this medicinal product should be 
instructed to report symptoms of infection to a physician. 
Opportunistic infections/progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
Cases of opportunistic infections, particularly of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
have been reported with other dimethyl fumarate-containing products (see section 4.8). PML is an 
opportunistic infection caused by the John-Cunningham virus (JCV) that can be fatal or cause severe 
disabilities. PML is probably caused by a combination of factors. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A previous infection with JCV is considered a prerequisite for the development of PML. Risk factors 
can include previous immunosuppressive treatment and the existence of certain concomitant disorders 
(such as some autoimmune disorders or malignant haematological conditions). A modified or 
weakened immune system as well as genetic or environmental factors can also constitute risk factors. 
Persistent moderate or severe lymphopenia during treatment with dimethyl fumarate is also considered 
a risk factor for PML. Patients who develop lymphopenia should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of opportunistic infections, particularly for symptoms indicative of PML. Typical 
symptoms associated with PML are diverse, become worse over days to weeks and include 
progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision and 
changes in thinking, memory and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. If PML is 
suspected, treatment should be stopped immediately and further appropriate neurological and 
radiological examinations performed. 
Prior and concomitant treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies 
Limited data are available on the efficacy and safety of Skilarence in patients who have been 
previously treated with other immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies. When switching 
patients from such therapies to Skilarence, the half-life and mode of action of the other therapy should 
be considered in order to avoid additive effects on the immune system. 
No data are available on the efficacy and safety of Skilarence when taken concomitantly with other 
immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies (see section 4.5). 
Pre-existing gastrointestinal disease 
Skilarence has not been studied in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease. It is 
contraindicated in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease (see sections 4.3). Gastrointestinal 
tolerability can be improved by following the dose titration schedule on initiating treatment and by 
taking the gastro-resistant tablet(s) with food (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Renal function 
During the Phase III placebo-controlled clinical study, renal function was not seen to deteriorate 
during therapy across treatment groups. However, Skilarence has not been studied in patients with 
severe renal impairment, and some cases of renal toxicity have been reported during post-marketing 
surveillance with fumaric acid esters. Hence, Skilarence is contraindicated in patients with severe 
renal impairment (see section 4.3). 
Renal function (e.g. creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and urinalysis) should be checked prior to 
initiation of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. In the event of a clinically relevant change in 
renal function, particularly in the absence of alternative explanations, consideration should be given to 
dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. 
Fanconi syndrome 
Early diagnosis of Fanconi syndrome and discontinuation of Skilarence treatment are important to 
prevent the onset of renal impairment and osteomalacia, as the syndrome is usually reversible. The 
most important signs are: proteinuria, glucosuria (with normal blood sugar levels), 
hyperaminoaciduria and phosphaturia (possibly concurrent with hypophosphatemia) (see section 4.8). 
Progression might involve symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia and proximal muscle weakness. In 
rare cases hypophosphataemic osteomalacia with non-localised bone pain, elevated alkaline 
phosphatase in serum and stress fractures may occur. Importantly, Fanconi syndrome can occur 
without elevated creatinine levels or low glomerular filtration rate. In case of unclear symptoms, 
Fanconi syndrome should be considered and appropriate examinations should be performed.

Hepatic function 
Skilarence has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in 
these patients (see section 4.3).  
It is recommended to monitor hepatic function (SGOT, SGPT, gamma-GT, AP) prior to initiation of 
treatment and every 3 months thereafter, since elevation of hepatic enzymes has been observed in 
some patients in the Phase III study (see section 4.8). In the event of a clinically relevant change in 
hepatic parameters, particularly in the absence of alternative explanations, consideration should be 
given to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2). 
Flushing 
Patients should be made aware that they are likely to experience flushing in the first few weeks of 
treatment (see section 4.8). 
Excipients 
Lactose 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Skilarence should be used cautiously in combination with other systemic antipsoriatic therapy (e.g. 
methotrexate, retinoids, psoralens, ciclosporin, immunosuppressants or cytostatics) (see section 4.4). 
During treatment, simultaneous use of other fumaric acid derivatives (topical or systemic) should be 
avoided. 
Concurrent therapy with nephrotoxic substances (e.g. methotrexate, ciclosporin, aminoglycosides, 
diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or lithium) may increase the potential for 
renal adverse reactions (e.g. proteinuria) in patients taking Skilarence. 
In cases of severe or prolonged diarrhoea during treatment with Skilarence, absorption of other 
medicinal products may be affected. Caution should be exercised when prescribing medicinal products 
with a narrow therapeutic index that require absorption in the intestinal tract. The efficacy of oral 
contraceptives may be reduced and the use of an alternative barrier contraceptive method is 
recommended to prevent possible failure of contraception (see the prescribing information of the oral 
contraceptive). 
Consumption of large quantities of strong alcoholic drinks (more than 30% alcohol by volume) should 
be avoided because it may lead to increased dissolution rates of Skilarence and, therefore, may 
increase the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 
Vaccination during treatment with Skilarence has not been studied. Immunosuppression is a risk factor 
for the use of live vaccines. The risk of vaccination should be weighed against the benefit. 
There is no evidence for interaction with cytochrome P450 and the most common efflux and uptake 
transporters, thus no interactions are expected with medicinal products metabolised or transported by 
these systems (see section 5.2).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of child-bearing potential 
Skilarence is not recommended in women of child-bearing potential not using appropriate 
contraception. Additional contraceptive methods in case of stomach and intestinal problems that could 
reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives could be necessary (see section 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of dimethyl fumarate in pregnant women. Animal studies have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Skilarence is contraindicated during pregnancy (see 
section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether dimethyl fumarate or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to 
newborns or infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, Skilarence is contraindicated during breast-
feeding (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
There are no human or animal data on the effects of Skilarence on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Skilarence may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and fatigue 
may occur following administration of Skilarence (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions observed with Skilarence are gastrointestinal events followed by 
flushing and lymphopenia.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Gastrointestinal disturbances 
Data from the Phase III clinical study as well as from the literature show that gastrointestinal disorders 
with dimethyl fumarate-containing products are most likely to occur during the first 2 to 3 months 
after starting treatment. No apparent dose relationship and no risk factors for the occurrence of these 
adverse reactions could be identified. Diarrhoea was a common adverse reaction (36.9%) among 
patients taking Skilarence, leading to medicinal product withdrawal in about 10% of patients. More 
than 90% of these diarrhoea events were of mild to moderate severity (see section 4.4). 
The only adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment in >5% of patients were 
gastrointestinal reactions. For monitoring recommendations and clinical management of adverse 
reactions, see section 4.4. 
Flushing 
Based on observations in the Phase III clinical study as well as on literature data, flushing is most 
likely to occur during the early weeks of treatment and tends to lessen with time. In the clinical study a 
total of 20.8% of patients receiving Skilarence experienced flushing, which was mild in the majority 
of cases (see section 4.4). Published clinical experience with dimethyl fumarate-containing products 
shows that individual episodes of flushing usually begin shortly after taking the tablets and resolve 
within a few hours. 
Haematological changes 
Data from the Phase III clinical study as well as from the literature show that changes in 
8 
 
 
 
 
haematological parameters are most likely to occur during the first 3 months after starting treatment 
with dimethyl fumarate. In particular, in the clinical study there was a slight decrease in mean 
lymphocyte counts starting between weeks 3 and 5 and reaching a maximum in week 12 where 
approximately one third of patients had lymphocyte values below 1.0x109/L. The mean and median 
values of lymphocytes remained within the normal range during the clinical study. At week 16 (end of 
treatment), there was no further decline in lymphocyte counts. At week 16 of treatment, 13/175 (7.4%) 
of patients were noted to have lymphocyte levels < 0.7x 109/L. Blood sampling for safety clinical 
laboratory tests at follow-up visits was only performed in case of abnormalities at the preceeding visit. 
During the treatment free follow up, lymphocyte levels of < 0.7x 109/L were observed in 1/29 (3.5%) 
patient at 6 months and 0/28 (0%) at 12 months after stopping treatment. At 12 months after stopping 
treatment 3/28 (10.7%) of patients had lymphocyte values below 1.0x109/L, which would represent 
3/279 (1.1%) of the patients started on Skilarence. 
For the total leukocyte count, a decline became apparent at week 12 of treatment; it slowly increased 
again at week 16 (end of treatment); and 12 months after stopping treatment all patients had values 
above 3.0x109/L. 
A transient increase in mean values of eosinophils was noted as early as week 3, reached a maximum 
at week 5 and 8, and had returned to baseline values at week 16.  
For monitoring recommendations and clinical management of haematological adverse reactions, see 
section 4.4. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptomatic treatment is indicated in the case of an overdose. No specific antidote is known. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, other immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AX07 
Mechanism of action 
The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects of dimethyl fumarate and its metabolite 
monomethyl fumarate are not fully elucidated but are thought to be mainly due to the interaction with 
the intracellular reduced glutathione of cells directly involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. This 
interaction with glutathione leads to the inhibition of translocation into the nucleus and the 
transcriptional activity of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB). 
The main activity of dimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate is considered to be 
immunomodulatory, resulting in a shift in T helper cells (Th) from the Th1 and Th17 profile to a Th2 
phenotype. The inflammatory cytokine production is reduced with induction of proapoptotic events, 
inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation, reduced expression of adhesion molecules, and diminished 
inflammatory infiltrate within psoriatic plaques.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
The safety and efficacy of Skilarence was assessed in one double-blind, 3-arm, placebo- and active 
comparator-controlled Phase III study (1102) in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
(Study 1102). 704 patients were randomised to receive Skilarence, an active comparator (Fumaderm, a 
combination product with the same content of dimethyl fumarate plus 3 monoethyl fumarate salts) and 
placebo in a ratio of 2:2:1. Patients began treatment with tablets containing 30 mg/day dimethyl 
fumarate or placebo, titrating up to a maximum of 720 mg/day in both active treatment arms as 
described in section 4.2. If treatment success was observed before the maximum dose of 720 mg/day 
of dimethyl fumarate was reached, no further increase of dose was necessary and the dose was to be 
steadily reduced to an individual maintenance dose. In case of individual intolerability of the increased 
dose during weeks 4 to 16, the patient was to return to the last tolerated dose taken since the start of 
week 4, which was to be maintained until end of the treatment period (week 16). Patients received 
treatment for up to 16 weeks and follow-up visits were planned for up to 12 months after treatment 
was stopped. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups. Of 
the 699 patients, most were Caucasian (99%) and male (65%), and the mean age was 44 years. Most 
patients (91%) were <65 years of age. Most patients had moderate psoriasis based on Psoriasis Area 
and Severity Index (PASI) and Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) scores at baseline: the mean 
PASI score at baseline was 16.35 and 60% of patients scored as moderate on the PGA. The majority of 
patients reported a “very large” or “extremely large” effect of psoriasis on their life based on the 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), with a mean DLQI score of 11.5. 
After 16 weeks of treatment, Skilarence was found to be superior to placebo (p<0.0001) based on 
PASI 75 and PGA score clear or almost clear and non-inferior (using a non-inferiority margin 
of -15%) to the active comparator (p<0.0003) based on PASI 75.

There was a trend in the efficacy endpoint PASI score mean % change from baseline, indicating the 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
onset of a clinical response to Skilarence as early as week 3 (-11.8%) which became statistically 
significant compared to placebo by week 8 (-30.9%). Further improvement was seen by week 16 
(-50.8%). 
The benefits of treatment with Skilarence were also supported by patient self-perceived improvements 
in their quality of life. At week 16, patients treated with Skilarence had a lower mean DLQI compared 
to placebo (5.4 vs 8.8).  
Rebound (defined as worsening of ≥125% of baseline PASI value) was assessed after 2 months off 
treatment and was shown not to be a clinical concern with fumaric acid esters, as it was documented in 
very few patients (Skilarence 1.1% and active comparator 2.2%, compared to 9.3% in the placebo 
group).  
Long-term efficacy data are currently not available for Skilarence, however, in the pharmacokinetic 
and clinical studies the systemic exposure, efficacy and safety of Skilarence were shown to be 
comparable to the active comparator containing dimethyl fumarate. Hence it is reasonable to expect 
the long-term efficacy of Skilarence to also be comparable to dimethyl fumarate-containing products. 
Maintenance of long term efficacy has been well described for other dimethyl fumarate-containing 
products, and therefore the treatment benefits seen with Skilarence at 16 weeks can be expected to be 
maintained in patients treated over the long term for at least 24 months. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Skilarence in all subsets of the paediatric population in psoriasis (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After oral administration, dimethyl fumarate is not detected in plasma because it is rapidly hydrolysed 
by esterases to its active metabolite monomethyl fumarate. After oral administration of a single 
Skilarence 120 mg tablet in healthy subjects, monomethyl fumarate reached plasma peak 
concentrations of around 1325 ng/mL and 1311 ng/mL under fasted or fed conditions, respectively. 
Taking Skilarence with food delayed the tmax of monomethyl fumarate from 3.5 to 9.0 hours. 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of monomethyl fumarate is around 50%. Dimethyl fumarate does not 
show any binding affinity to serum proteins which may further contribute to its rapid elimination from 
the circulation. 
Biotransformation 
The biotransformation of dimethyl fumarate does not involve cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. In vitro 
studies have shown that monomethyl fumarate at the therapeutic dose does not inhibit or induce any of 
the cytochrome P450 enzymes, it is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and is not an 
inhibitor of the most common efflux and uptake transporters. In vitro studies have shown that dimethyl 
fumarate at a therapeutic dose does not inhibit CYP3A4/5 and BCRP and is a weak P-glycoprotein 
inhibitor. 
In vitro studies have shown that hydrolysis of dimethyl fumarate to monomethyl fumarate occurs 
rapidly at pH 8 (pH in the small intestine), but not at pH 1 (pH in the stomach). A part of the total 
dimethyl fumarate is hydrolysed by esterases and the alkaline milieu of the small intestine, while the 
remainder enters the portal vein blood. Further studies have shown that dimethyl fumarate (and to a 
lesser extent monomethyl fumarate) reacts partially with reduced glutathione forming a glutathione-
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adduct. These adducts were detected in animal studies in the intestinal mucosa of rats and to a smaller 
extent in portal vein blood. Unconjugated dimethyl fumarate, however, cannot be detected in the 
plasma of animals or psoriatic patients following oral administration. By contrast, unconjugated 
monomethyl fumarate is detectable in plasma. Further metabolism occurs through oxidation via the 
tricarboxylic acid cycle forming carbon dioxide and water. 
Elimination 
Exhalation of CO2 resulting from the metabolism of monomethyl fumarate is the primary route of 
elimination; only small amounts of intact monomethyl fumarate are excreted through urine or faeces. 
The portion of dimethyl fumarate that reacts with glutathione, forming a glutathione-adduct, is 
metabolised further to its mercapturic acid, which is excreted in the urine. 
The apparent terminal elimination half-life of monomethyl fumarate is about 2 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Despite the high inter-subject variability, the exposure measured as AUC and Cmax was generally 
dose-proportional after single dose administration of 4 x 30 mg dimethyl fumarate tablets (total dose 
of 120 mg) and 2 x 120 mg dimethyl fumarate tablets (total dose of 240 mg). 
Renal impairment 
No specific studies have been performed in patients with renal impairment. However, because renal 
elimination plays a minor role in the total clearance from plasma, it is unlikely that renal impairment 
may affect the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Skilarence (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No specific studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment. However, as dimethyl 
fumarate is metabolised by esterases and the alkaline milieu of the small intestine without the 
involvement of cytochrome P450, hepatic impairment is not expected to influence exposure (see 
section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology and genotoxicity. 
Toxicology 
The kidney was identified as a major target organ of toxicity in non-clinical studies. Renal findings in 
dogs included minimal to moderate tubular hypertrophy, increased incidence and severity of tubular 
vacuolation and minimal to slight tubular degeneration, which were considered toxicologically 
relevant. The no-observed adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) after 3 months of treatment was 
30 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to 2.9-fold and 9.5-fold the human systemic exposure at the highest 
recommended dose (720 mg/day), as AUC and Cmax values, respectively. 
Reproduction toxicity 
No fertility or pre- and post-natal development studies have been conducted with Skilarence. 
There were no effects on foetal body weights or malformations attributed to maternal administration of 
dimethyl fumarate during the embryo-foetal development study in rats. However, there was an 
increased number of foetuses with the variations “supernumerary liver lobe” and “abnormal iliac 
alignment” at maternally toxic doses. The NOAEL for maternal and embryo-foetal toxicity was 
40 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 0.2-fold and 2.0-fold the human systemic exposure at the highest 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended dose (720 mg/day), as AUC and Cmax values, respectively. 
Dimethyl fumarate has been shown to cross the placental membrane into foetal blood in rats. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed for Skilarence. Based on available data suggesting 
that fumaric acid esters may activate cellular pathways related to the development of renal tumours, a 
potential tumorigenic activity of exogenously administered dimethyl fumarate on the kidneys cannot 
be excluded.

1.  What Skilarence is and what it is used for 
What Skilarence is 
Skilarence is a medicine that contains the active substance dimethyl fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate 
works on cells of the immune system (the body's natural defences). It changes the activity of the 
immune system by reducing the production of certain substances involved in causing psoriasis. 
What Skilarence is used for 
Skilarence tablets are used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Psoriasis is a disease 
causing thickened, inflamed, red areas on the skin, often covered by silvery scales. 
Response to Skilarence can be generally seen as early as week 3 and improves over time. Experience 
with related products containing dimethyl fumarate shows treatment benefit for at least up to 
24 months. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Skilarence 
Do not take Skilarence 
- 
if you are allergic to dimethyl fumarate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
if you have severe problems with your stomach or intestines 
if you have severe liver or kidney problems 
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding 
- 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Skilarence. 
Monitoring 
Skilarence may cause problems with your blood, liver or kidneys. You will have blood and urine tests 
before treatment and then regularly during your treatment. This is to make sure that you are not getting 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these complications and can continue taking this medicine. Depending on the results of these blood 
and urine tests, your doctor may decide to increase the dose of Skilarence as per the advised schedule 
(see section 3), maintain your dose, reduce your dose or stop treatment altogether. 
Infections 
White blood cells help your body to fight infections. Skilarence may reduce the number of your white 
blood cells. Talk to your doctor if you think you may have an infection. Symptoms include fever, pain, 
aching muscles, headache, loss of appetite and a general feeling of weakness. If you have a serious 
infection, either before starting treatment with Skilarence or during treatment, your doctor may advise 
you not to take Skilarence until the infection has resolved. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your stomach or intestines. Your doctor will 
advise you on what care you need to take during Skilarence treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
Children and adolescents below the age of 18 years should not take this medicine because it has not 
been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Skilarence 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking the following: 
- 
- 
- 
Dimethyl fumarate or other fumarates. The active substance in Skilarence, dimethyl 
fumarate, is also used in other medicines such as tablets, ointments and baths. You must avoid 
using other products that contain fumarates to prevent taking too much. 
Other medicines used to treat psoriasis, such as methotrexate, retinoids, psoralens, 
ciclosporin, or other medicines that affect the immune system (such as immunosuppressants or 
cytostatics). Taking these medicines with Skilarence could increase the risk of side effects on 
your immune system. 
Other medicines that can affect your kidney function, such as methotrexate or ciclosporin 
(used to treat psoriasis), aminoglycosides (used to treat infections), diuretics (which increase 
urine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (used to treat pain) or lithium (used for bipolar 
disease and depression). These medicines taken together with Skilarence could increase the risk 
of side effects on your kidneys. 
If you get severe or prolonged diarrhoea due to using Skilarence, other medicines may not work as 
well as they should. In that case, discuss your diarrhoea with your doctor. If you are taking a 
contraceptive medicine (the pill), this is especially important as the effect may be reduced and you 
may need to use additional methods to prevent pregnancy. See the instructions in the patient leaflet of 
the contraceptive you are taking. 
If you need a vaccination, talk to your doctor. Certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) may cause 
infection if used during treatment with Skilarence. Your doctor can advise you what would be best. 
Skilarence with alcohol 
Avoid strong alcoholic drinks (more than 50 ml of spirits containing more than 30% alcohol by 
volume) during treatment with Skilarence, as alcohol can interact with this medicine. This could cause 
stomach and intestinal problems. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Skilarence if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, as Skilarence may harm your 
baby. Use effective methods of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with 
Skilarence (see also “Other medicines and Skilarence” above). In case of stomach and intestinal 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
problems that could reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, you should consult your doctor 
who will advise you on additional contraceptive methods. 
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Skilarence. 
Driving and using machines 
Skilarence may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. You may feel dizzy or 
tired after taking Skilarence. If you are affected, be careful when driving or using machines. 
Skilarence contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product. 
Skilarence contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to take Skilarence 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Dose 
Your doctor will start your treatment with a low dose of Skilarence by using 30 mg tablets. This helps 
your body to get used to the medicine and to reduce the risk of side effects, such as stomach and 
intestinal problems. The dose will be increased with 30 mg every week as shown in the table below. 
When reaching a dose of 120 mg Skilarence per day, usually from week 4 onwards, you can switch to 
120 mg tablets for convenience. When switching tablets from 30 mg to 120 mg, please make sure you 
are using the right tablet and dose.

Your doctor will check how well your condition is improving after you start taking Skilarence and will 
check for side effects. If you have severe side effects after an increase in dose, your doctor may 
recommend that you temporarily go back to the last dose. If the side effects are not that troublesome, 
your dose will be increased until your condition is well controlled. You may not need the maximum 
dose of 720 mg per day as supplied in the table above. After your condition has improved sufficiently, 
your doctor will consider how to gradually reduce the daily dose of Skilarence to what you need to 
maintain your improvement.

Method of administration 
Swallow Skilarence tablets whole with liquid. Take your tablet(s) during or immediately after a meal. 
Do not crush, break, dissolve or chew the tablet, as they have a special coating to help prevent 
irritation of your stomach. 
If you take more Skilarence than you should 
If you think you have taken too many Skilarence tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you forget to take Skilarence 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take the next dose at the usual time and 
continue taking the medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or exactly as agreed with your doctor. 
Please ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

1.  What Skilarence is and what it is used for 
What Skilarence is 
Skilarence is a medicine that contains the active substance dimethyl fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate 
works on cells of the immune system (the body's natural defences). It changes the activity of the 
immune system by reducing the production of certain substances involved in causing psoriasis. 
What Skilarence is used for 
Skilarence tablets are used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Psoriasis is a disease 
causing thickened, inflamed, red areas on the skin, often covered by silvery scales. 
Response to Skilarence can be generally seen as early as week 3 and improves over time. Experience 
with related products containing dimethyl fumarate shows treatment benefit for at least up to 
24 months. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Skilarence 
Do not take Skilarence 
- 
if you are allergic to dimethyl fumarate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
if you have severe problems with your stomach or intestines  
if you have severe liver or kidney problems 
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding 
- 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Skilarence. 
Monitoring 
Skilarence may cause problems with your blood, liver or kidneys. You will have blood and urine tests 
before treatment and then regularly during your treatment. This is to make sure that you are not getting 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these complications and can continue taking this medicine. Depending on the results of these blood 
and urine tests, your doctor may decide to increase the dose of Skilarence as per the advised schedule 
(see section 3), maintain your dose, reduce your dose or stop treatment altogether. 
Infections 
White blood cells help your body to fight infections. Skilarence may reduce the number of your white 
blood cells. Talk to your doctor if you think you may have an infection. Symptoms include fever, pain, 
aching muscles, headache, loss of appetite and a general feeling of weakness. If you have a serious 
infection, either before starting treatment with Skilarence or during treatment, your doctor may advise 
you not to take Skilarence until the infection has resolved.  
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your stomach or intestines. Your doctor will 
advise you on what care you need to take during Skilarence treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
Children and adolescents below the age of 18 years should not take this medicine because it has not 
been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Skilarence 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking the following: 
- 
- 
- 
Dimethyl fumarate or other fumarates. The active substance in Skilarence, dimethyl 
fumarate, is also used in other medicines such as tablets, ointments and baths. You must avoid 
using other products that contain fumarates to prevent taking too much. 
Other medicines used to treat psoriasis, such as methotrexate, retinoids, psoralens, 
ciclosporin, or other medicines that affect the immune system (such as immunosuppressants or 
cytostatics). Taking these medicines with Skilarence could increase the risk of side effects on 
your immune system. 
Other medicines that can affect your kidney function, such as methotrexate or ciclosporin 
(used to treat psoriasis), aminoglycosides (used to treat infections), diuretics (which increase 
urine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (used to treat pain) or lithium (used for bipolar 
disease and depression). These medicines taken together with Skilarence could increase the risk 
of side effects on your kidneys. 
If you get severe or prolonged diarrhoea due to using Skilarence, other medicines may not work as 
well as they should. In that case, discuss your diarrhoea with your doctor. If you are taking a 
contraceptive medicine (the pill), this is especially important as the effect may be reduced and you 
may need to use additional methods to prevent pregnancy. See the instructions in the patient leaflet of 
the contraceptive you are taking. 
If you need a vaccination, talk to your doctor. Certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) may cause 
infection if used during treatment with Skilarence. Your doctor can advise you what would be best. 
Skilarence with alcohol 
Avoid strong alcoholic drinks (more than 50 ml of spirits containing more than 30% alcohol by 
volume) during treatment with Skilarence, as alcohol can interact with this medicine. This could cause 
stomach and intestinal problems. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Skilarence if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, as Skilarence may harm your 
baby. Use effective methods of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with 
Skilarence (see also “Other medicines and Skilarence” above). In case of stomach and intestinal 
problems that could reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, you should consult your doctor 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
who will advise you on additional contraceptive methods.  
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Skilarence. 
Driving and using machines 
Skilarence may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. You may feel dizzy or 
tired after taking Skilarence. If you are affected, be careful when driving or using machines. 
Skilarence contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product. 
Skilarence contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to take Skilarence 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Dose 
Your doctor will start your treatment with a low dose of Skilarence by using 30 mg tablets. This helps 
your body to get used to the medicine and to reduce the risk of side effects, such as stomach and 
intestinal problems. The dose will be increased with 30 mg every week as shown in the table below. 
When reaching a dose of  120 mg Skilarence per day, usually from week 4 onwards, you can switch to 
120 mg tablets for convenience. When switching tablets from 30 mg to 120 mg, please make sure you 
are using the right tablet and dose.

Your doctor will check how well your condition is improving after you start taking Skilarence and will 
check for side effects. If you have severe side effects after an increase in dose, your doctor may 
recommend that you temporarily go back to the last dose. If the side effects are not that troublesome, 
your dose will be increased until your condition is well controlled. You may not need the maximum 
dose of 720 mg per day as supplied in the table above. After your condition has improved sufficiently, 
your doctor will consider how to gradually reduce the daily dose of Skilarence to what you need to 
maintain your improvement. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method of administration 
Swallow Skilarence tablets whole with liquid. Take your tablet(s) during or immediately after a meal. 
Do not crush, break, dissolve or chew the tablet, as they have a special coating to help prevent 
irritation of your stomach. 
If you take more Skilarence than you should 
If you think you have taken too many Skilarence tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you forget to take Skilarence 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take the next dose at the usual time and 
continue taking the medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or exactly as agreed with your doctor. 
Please ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

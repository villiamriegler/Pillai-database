1.  Introduction 
On 24 September 2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Humira, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study P13-170 PMOS Special Investigation (Long-term treatment CD patients) is 
a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
HUMIRA 40 mg Syringe 0.8 mL for Subcutaneous Injection 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In EU Adalimumab (Humira) is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease, in adult patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a 
corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies. In paediatric CD (within EU): Humira is indicated for the 
treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric patients (from 6 years of age) 
who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including primary nutrition therapy and 
a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or have contraindications for 
such therapies. 
Safety and effectiveness of adalimumab for CD patients has been investigated in Western patients in 
three studies: two induction studies (Study M02-403 and Study M04-691) and one maintenance study 
(Study M02-404). Similar results were obtained in Japanese clinical studies (induction therapy: Study 
M04-729, maintenance therapy: Study M06-837). The application to add the CD indication to the 
Humira label in Japan was made in September 2009, and the indication was approved in October 2010. 
The investigation described in this document was performed after approval for the purpose of 
evaluating the safety and effectiveness of HUMIRA under actual clinical practice conditions. 
This surveillance study was conducted as a post-approval commitment following the approval of CD, 
per the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency's (PMDA) requirement for such studies when new 
compounds or new indications are approved. 
Dosage and Administration of Crohn's Disease in Japan 
The initial dose of adalimumab for adult Crohn's Disease patients is 160 mg as subcutaneous injection. 
The initial dose is followed by 80 mg 2 weeks later. Four weeks after the initial dose begin a 
maintenance dose of 40 mg every other week. The dose may be increased to 80 mg administered eow 
when the effect of treatment with 40 mg eow is decreased.

Study P13-170; Long-term treatment CD patients 
Description 
Study design 
This was a single-arm, multicentre, prospective cohort study (post marketing observational study). The 
observation period was up to 3 years. 
This study was conducted from November 2011 to March 2017. The enrollment period of subjects was 
from November 2011 to October 2013. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
This investigation was to be conducted to obtain the following information regarding the use of Humira 
40 mg Syringe 0.8 mL for Subcutaneous Injection, on the safety (especially profile of malignant 
tumours and serious infections) and effectiveness in patients with Crohn's disease who are receiving 
Humira for an extended period of time. 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 511 patients were enrolled. Among the enrolled patients, case report forms were not 
collected from 7 patients, so there were 504 patients whose data in case report forms were assessable.  
From the 504 patients for whom case report forms were obtained, 389 patients were evaluable for the 
safety analysis, after the exclusion of a total of 115 patients as follows (more than one reason could be 
provided for exclusion): 2 patients treated with Humira before the contract for the survey ("treated 
before contract") were excluded, 111 patients who were overdue for the time frame for registration 
(14 days) defined in the protocol ("violation of registration criteria: deviation from registration 
period"), 3 patients with malignancy before the registration ("violation of protocol criteria: 
malignancy"). A total of 310 patients were evaluable for the efficacy analysis, after 79 patients 
("efficacy assessment impossible") were excluded from the 389 patients who made up the safety 
analysis set. 
Among the 389 patients included in the safety analysis set, there was 1 patient under 15 years old 
(14years old), 17 patients between 15 and 17 years old, 366 patients between 18 and 64 years old, 
and 5 patients over 65 years old.

17/389) and the common serious adverse reaction by preferred term (MedDRA PT: ≥ 5 patients) and 
its incidence rate was "Crohn's disease" (1.29%, 5/389). 
Paediatric population 
Across the paediatric population (N = 18), a total of 15 adverse events (AEs) were noted in 9 
paediatric patients (50.0%). The age range of 9 paediatric patients with AEs was 16.1 years old. The 
age of the paediatric patients with AEs were: 3 patients at 15 years old, 2 patients at 16 years old, and 
4 patients at 17 years old. A total of 14 non-serious adverse events and 1 serious adverse event (SAE) 
were observed, which corresponded to an overall observed rate of 30.43 events (E)/100 patient-
treatment years (PTYs) and 2.17 E/100 PTYs, respectively. 
Case: Fracture (SAE) 
A 15-year-old male with a history of CD, enteral nutrition treatment for an unknown duration, who had 
received Humira (160 mg, 80 mg and 40 mg) for approximately 2 months, experienced a bone fracture 
due to traumatic injury. Humira was discontinued due to the surgery, and the reporting physician did 
not consider the event related to Humira. The event resolved with surgery. 
The single cases of "mycoplasmal tracheobronchitis" and "pneumonia" are described below. 
Case: Mycoplasmal tracheobronchitis 
A 17-year-old female with a history of CD, who had received Humira (160 mg, 80 mg and 40 mg) for 
approximately 2 years and 8 months, experienced pyrexia, runny nose and cough. The diagnosis of 
mycoplasmal tracheobronchitis was confirmed with a chest x-ray. Humira was discontinued due to the 
event and an antimicrobial agent administered for 1 week. The event outcome was improved. 
Case: Pneumonia 
A 16-year-old male with a history of CD, enteral nutrition treatment for an unknown duration, who had 
received Humira (160 mg, 80 mg and 40 mg) for approximately 2 years and 4 months, experienced 
pyrexia and cough. The influenza test was negative; the diagnosis of pneumonia was confirmed with a 
chest x-ray. Antimicrobial agents were administered for 10 days. The event outcome was improved.

CHMP's comment: 
The safety results in this study are considered to be in line with the known safety profile for 
adalimumab. The safety profile in the small group of 18 paediatric patients did not differ from the 
overall known safety profile. It is agreed that the serious adverse event with a fracture is not related to 
adalimumab treatment. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
MAH Discussion 
Safety 
In this surveillance study, the safety profile of Humira in CD remained similar to that established in the 
controlled clinical trials in adult patients with CD; no new safety signals were observed and the 
incidence rate of adverse events in adult and paediatric patients did not increase. The adverse events 
of special interest as determined in the study protocol did not reveal any new risks. 
Efficacy 
Efficacy was comparable to that seen in the controlled clinical studies, including in patients below 18 
years of age. 
The findings of this post marketing observational study support the conclusion that adalimumab is 
effective for the treatment of CD in Japanese patients, and that efficacy is sustained over time. There 
were no new safety signals observed, and the data are consistent with the known safety profile of 
adalimumab in adult and paediatric CD and the other approved indications.

Although the approved CD indication in Japan is for adults, the regulatory agency requested that all 
patients, i.e., including paediatric patients, should be included in this study. Paediatric patients in 
Japan are defined as < 15 years of age whereas in the Western world, the age cut-off is usually 18 
years. In this surveillance study, 1 patient was below the age of 15, and 18 patients in total were 
below 18 years of age. No specific safety findings were seen in those patients.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
There were no new safety signals revealed in this study. In the small group of 18 paediatric patients 
the efficacy and safety profile was in line with earlier experience and in line with the description in the 
SmPC. 
The benefit/risk ratio of adalimumab for the treatment of CD remains unchanged. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

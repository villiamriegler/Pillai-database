2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement: 
Acute  leukaemia,  the  most  common  form  of  cancer  in  children,  comprises  approximately  30%of  all 
childhood malignancies, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) being five times more common than 
acute  myeloid  leukaemia.  Philadelphia  positive  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (Ph+  ALL)  is 
characterised  by  the  presence  of  the  Philadelphia  chromosome,  a  reciprocal  translocation  between 
chromosomes  9  and  22  (t(9;22)(q34;q11))  resulting  in  the  fusion  of  the  break  cluster  region  (bcr) 
gene  on  chromosome  22  with  c-abl  gene  sequences  translocated  from  chromosome  9  and  the 
expression of the BCR-ABL protein. BCR-ABL fusion proteins are constitutively active tyrosine kinases 
that  can  alter  multiple  signalling  pathways,  which  contribute  to  tumour  growth  and  proliferation. 
Ph+ALL accounts for 15-30% of adult ALL and up to 5% of paediatric ALL. 
Survival  rates  for  ALL  have  improved  dramatically  since  the  1980s,  with  a  current  five-year  overall 
survival  rates  estimated  at  greater  than  85  percent.  In  children,  long-term  survival  rates  are 
approximately 80%. This improvement in survival is due to treatment of a large number of children on 
sequential standardised research protocols.  
Unfortunately, with chemotherapy alone, only 20–30% of children with Ph+ ALL are cured. Allogeneic 
hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (HSCT)  with  a  closely  matched  donor  in  first  complete 
remission cures 60% of patients. A review of 326 documented cases of Ph+ ALL diagnosed and treated 
by  ten  study  groups  and  institutions  from  1986  to  1996  described  estimated  5  year  disease-free 
survival ranging from 49% to 20%, for patients with the best and worst prognosis, respectively (Arico, 
2000). 
Treatment  of  children  with  ALL  involves  administration  of  a  multidrug  regimen  that  is  divided  into 
several  phases  (ie,  induction,  consolidation,  and  maintenance)  and  includes  therapy  directed  to  the 
central nervous system (CNS). Most treatment protocols take two to three years to complete, although 
the specific regimen varies depending upon immunophenotype and risk category. 
Induction  therapy  is  the  initial  phase  of  treatment  and  is  designed  to  place  the  patient  in  remission. 
More  than  90%  of  children  and  adolescents  with  ALL  enter  CR  at  the  end  of  induction  therapy 
regardless  of  their  initial  risk  grouping.  Induction  therapy  usually  involves  weekly  administration  of 
vincristine for three to four weeks, daily corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone, or dexamethasone), 
and  asparaginase,  either  in  its  pegylated  form or  as  6  to 12  doses  of  L-asparaginase.  A  fourth  agent 
such as an anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin or daunorubicin) may be added to the three-dose regimen, 
particularly  for  high-risk  patients.  Early  clearance  of  lymphoblasts  from  the  bone  marrow  and  the 
presence  of  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  at  day 15  and  the  end  of  induction  therapy  are  the  best 
indicators of  outcome.  Patients  who  respond  rapidly  to  the  induction  regimen  appear  to  have  a  more 
favorable  outcome,  whereas  those  who  have  a  slow  response  or  who  fail  induction  therapy  have  a 
more  guarded  prognosis.  Induction  failure,  which  occurs  in  fewer  than  5%of  cases,  is  defined  by  the 
persistence of leukemic blasts in the blood, bone marrow, or any extramedullary site after four to six 
weeks of remission-induction therapy. Induction failure has  historically been considered a particularly 
ominous sign and an indication for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). 
Leukemic involvement of the CNS at the time of diagnosis is an uncommon finding, occurring in fewer 
than 5% of patients. However, before the use of preventive CNS therapy, up to 80 percent of children 
with  ALL  who  were  in  complete  bone  marrow  remission  relapsed  with  "leukemic  meningitis".  The 
routine  use  of  preventive  CNS  therapy  is  a  major  therapeutic  advance  in  the  treatment  of  childhood 
ALL. CNS treatment usually begins during the induction phase and continues throughout the remainder 
of the treatment regimen. 
Consolidation or intensification therapy is the second phase of ALL treatment and is initiated soon after 
attainment  of  CR.  Ongoing  treatment  is  required  because  small  numbers  of  leukemic  lymphoblasts

(referred  to  as  MRD)  remain  in  the  bone  marrow  despite  histologic  evidence  of  CR  after  induction 
therapy. In such cases, relapse occurs quickly if therapy is not continued. 
The  goal  of  post-induction  chemotherapy  is  to  prevent  leukemic  regrowth,  reduce  residual  tumour 
burden, and prevent the emergence of drug-resistance in the remaining leukemic cells. 
Consolidation  therapy  usually  lasts  from  four  to  six  months.  It  commonly  involves  the  use  of  several 
different  drug  combinations  and  drugs  with  mechanisms  of  action  that  differ  from  those  used  during 
the induction phase. The MRD status is one of the most important predictor of disease-free and overall 
survival. Patients with detectable MRD have an increased risk of relapse after conventional therapy. As 
a general rule, the higher the risk for treatment failure, the more aggressive the intensification therapy 
plan. 
Selected  patients  with  high-risk  disease  have  an  increased  incidence  of  relapse  during  intensification 
chemotherapy  (eg,  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  ALL,  severe  hypodiploid  ALL  (less  than  46 
chromosomes),  infants  with  ALL,  and  those  who  have  failed  initial  induction  therapy).  These  patients 
are candidates for receiving HCT during first remission. 
In  the  maintenance  therapy, the  overall  treatment  duration  for  most  children  with  ALL  is  24  to  36 
months. After completion of the consolidation or intensification phase of therapy, patients often receive 
a  less  intensive  continuation  regimen  using  daily  oral  6-mercaptopurine  (6-MP) and  weekly 
methotrexate with periodic intrathecal therapy. 
Approximately  20  to  25  percent  of  children  with  ALL  fail  initial  treatment.  Patients  with  relapsed  ALL 
require aggressive reinduction therapy and intensification, often using agents not administered in the 
original  treatment  protocol.  Nelarabine  and  clofarabine  have  been  used  for  the  treatment  of  relapsed 
ALL. Although patients in first relapse usually attain a second remission with induction chemotherapy, 
they often relapse after short periods despite aggressive treatment. These patients are candidates for 
HCT once they have attained second remission 
About the product 
Imatinib  is  a  small  molecule  protein-tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  that  potently  inhibits  the  activity  of  the 
BCR-ABL1  tyrosine  kinase  (TK)  and  of  several  other  receptor  TKs,  including  KIT,  the  stem  cell  factor 
(SCF)  receptor,  the  discoidin  domain  receptors  (DDR1  and  DDR2),  the  colony  stimulation  factor 
receptor (CSF-1R) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors α and β (PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β). 
The  inhibitory  effects  of  imatinib  on  primary  ALL  blasts  expressing  p190BCR-ABL  are  similar  to those 
observed on primary chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) blasts expressing p210BCR-ABL. 
Glivec  is  currently  approved  in  over  110  countries  for  the  treatment  of  both  haematological 
malignancies  and  solid  tumours.  Glivec  is  already  approved  in  a  paediatric  indication  (paediatric 
patients  with  Ph+  CML  in  blast  crisis,  accelerated  phase,  or  chronic  phase  after  failure  of  interferon-
alpha therapy) at a recommended dose of 340 mg/m2 daily. Glivec is currently approved in the EU for 
the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  integrated  with  chemotherapy  at  a 
recommended  dose  of  600  mg/day.  Glivec  is  also  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL.  
The present application is intended to seek approval for the following indication: “Glivec, integrated 
with chemotherapy, is indicated for the treatment of newly diagnosed paediatric patients with 
Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia”. 
A Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) was developed in accordance with Article 8 of the European 
Regulation (EC) 1901/2006. A final opinion from the EMA PDCO was received on 27 January 2012 on 
the acceptance of a modification of an agreed paediatric investigation plan for imatinib mesilate 
(Glivec) (EMEA-000463-PIP01-08-M03). 
In the context of the PIP, the Company was asked to submit the results of three studies: 
−  Study 1: Open-label, multi-centre, non-randomised, dose-escalation trial to evaluate safety 
and efficacy of chemotherapy, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and imatinib in children 
from 1 year to less than 18 years (and young adults) with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

−  Study 2: Open-label, multi-centre, randomised trial to evaluate safety, activity and efficacy of 
imatinib on top of chemotherapy and in combination with haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation in children from 1 year to less than 18 years with acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia. 
−  Study 3: Development and validation of an integrated physiology-based pharmacokinetic 
(PBPK) and population pharmacokinetics model 
Overall, the PIP agreed by the PDCO has been followed and the PDCO has issued an opinion that the 
studies were completed in compliance with the PIP and that the timelines have been respected.  
The Company has submitted the three studies. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies were submitted. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The maximum anticipated daily dose foreseen for imatinib in paediatric patients is 600 mg. 
Imatinib  is  rapidly  absorbed  after  oral  administration  and  is  a  substrate  of  CYP3A4,  resulting  in  one 
main metabolite, the N-demethylated piperazine derivative, with similar pharmacological activity as the 
parent substance. Excretion of imatinib as unchanged parent substance accounts for 25% with 5% and 
20%  excreted  in  urine  and  faeces,  respectively.  Results  from  a  new  study  on  toxicity  to  sediment-
dwelling organisms (OECD219) have been reported and a Tier B assessment was conducted.

2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic properties and the toxicological profile of imatinib mesylate have been adequately 
described  and  assessed  in  previous  applications.  No  additional  non-clinical  studies  are  considered 
necessary.  
Imatinib mesylate is not a PBT substance. The calculation of the PECsediment using the equation R16-
35 and the study following the OECD219 guidance are considered appropriate. A risk for sediment 
organisms has been identified. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of 
in accordance with local requirements (see SmPC sections 5.3, 6.6).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Imatinib is available as two different dosage forms: hard gelatin capsules and film-coated tablets. For 
paediatric  patients  who  are  unable  to  swallow  the  capsules,  the  capsules  may  be  opened  and  the 
contents should be dissolved either in water or in apple juice. For paediatric patients who are unable to 
swallow the film-coated tablets, the tablets may be dispersed in a glass of mineral water or apple juice 
per instruction of SmPC.  
2.3.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
This  application  included  two  modelling  study  reports  [pooled  population  pharmacokinetic  modelling 
report  update]  and  [PBPK  modelling  report  update].  The  pooled  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis 
was conducted in paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years with haematological disorders including CML, 
Ph+ALL,  or  other  imatinib  indicated  haematological  disorders  in  four  clinical  studies:  CSTI571A0103, 
CSTI57103001, CSTI571A2108, and CSTI571A2110. Since the 100 mg and 400 mg tablet formulations 
were  bioequivalent  with  the  100  mg  hard  gelatin  capsule,  it  is  appropriate  to  pool  PK  data  from  the 
above 4 studies into a single popPK analysis.  
• 
• 
• 
 [CSTI571A2108] was a phase II non-randomised single arm study to determine the response rate 
of imatinib in paediatric CML and delineate its toxicity and PK in paediatric patients. Imatinib was 
administered  orally,  at  340mg/m2,  rounded  to  the  nearest  100  mg  increment,  once  daily.  In  the 
absence  of  dose-limiting  toxicities,  there  was  no  planned  interruption  of  therapy.  Each  28-day 
period was considered a treatment course.  
[CSTI57103001] was a phase 1 dose-finding study to determine the safety, tolerability, PK and PD 
profiles  of  imatinib  in  patients  with  CML  resistant  to  interferon-alpha  (IFN).  Six  children  received 
175 to 260 mg/m2 daily dose and had evaluable PK data for the popPK analysis.  
[CSTI57A10103] was a phase 1 dose-finding study to determine the safety, tolerability, PK/PD and 
efficacy  of  imatinib  in  paediatric patients  with  Ph+  leukaemia.  The  starting  dose  was  260  mg/m2 
daily and dose was escalated to 340, 440, 570 mg/m2.  
•  Study [CSTI571A2110] was a non-randomised, open-label study in which patients diagnosed with 
CML,  Ph+  ALL  or  other  imatinib  indicated  haematological  disorders  between  the  ages  of  1  to  4 
years  were  administered  a  daily  dose  of  STI571  ranging  from  260  mg/m2  to  340  mg/m2.  The 
duration of this study was a maximum of 21 days, during which 2 sets of PK profiles were collected 
from each patient. This study was discontinued early as agreed by PDCO due to the lack of patient 
population and accrual.  
Pooled Population Pharmacokinetics Modeling 
Experimental methods and data: Data from subjects between 2 and 18 years of age were pooled from 
studies  CSTI571A2110,  CSTI571A2108,  CSTI57103001,  and  CSTI5710103.  Plasma  concentrations 
were measured for imatinib and the major pharmacologically active metabolite CGP74588.  
Data  analysis  and  modeling  methods:  Nonlinear  mixed-effects  models  for  the  popPK  of  imatinib  and 
CGP74588  were  developed  using  NONMEM  Version  VI  Level  2.0  with  METHOD=1  INTERACTION.  The 
likelihood function and diagnostic plots were used to assess goodness of fit and to suggest refinements 
to the model.  
As part of the model validation, the final model was refitted by excluding the subjects younger than 4 
years. The parameter estimates were compared to the corresponding estimates from the full dataset. 
Assessment report  
EMA/378913/2013  
Page 8/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The concentration-time course of the 9 excluded subjects was predicted and compared to the observed 
concentrations.  
The  final model was used  to assess clearance across body surface area (BSA), body weight and age. 
The  clearance  relationship  with  body  weight  from  the  final  model  was  compared  to  a  previously 
reported adult model.  
The  final  model  was  then  used  to  simulate  PK  parameters  and  related  PK  exposure  measures  (AUC, 
Cmax,  Cmin)  for  the  proposed  paediatric  doses  of  260  and  340  mg/m2,  as  well  as  for  various 
alternative dosing schemes, including those designed to match the AUC for children with adults. 
The  target  exposures  used  in  the  model-based  simulations  for  dosing  schemes  MODELAUC40  and 
MODELAUC60  were  derived  from  previous  population  PK  analysis  in  adult  CML  patients.  The  previous 
adult CML patient modeling suggested that CL is approximately 10 L/h and AUCs were approximately 
40 and 60 h×mg/L for adult 400 mg and 600 mg dose, respectively, from an integrated popPK report 
in adult patients.  
Physiologically-based PK (PBPK) Modeling Report 
PBPK  model  reflects  current  knowledge  about  pharmacological  processes  that  are  known  to  be  well 
characterised.  Therefore  poor  characterisation  of  some  physiological  or  pharmacological  process  with 
respect  to  imatinib  in  younger  children  aged  1-2  years  may  lead  to  a  sub-optimal  estimation  of  PK 
behaviour of imatinib in this age group. Therefore it is important to consider the validity of some model 
assumptions  and  uncertainty  of  model  parameters  when  one  interprets  the  results  from  PBPK 
modelling.  
Objectives:  
 
 
 
To  predict  pediatric  AUC  at  steady-state  using  PBPK  approach  based  on  imatinib  clearance  in 
adult population, then compare the results with the experimentally observed AUC values, with 
specific focus on children age 1 year and older.  
To  predict  imatinib  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  in  plasma  and  tissue  in  pediatric 
subjects, and to assess the effect of pediatric growth processes using a PBPK model  
To evaluate factors influencing imatinib exposure in pediatric patients  
Experimental methods and data: Paediatric growth database was obtained from the literature, such as 
organ size, blood flow, enzyme and plasma protein maturation. No clinical data were used for model-
based  simulation.  Clinical  data  from  pooled  studies  were  used  as  references  to  compare  with  model 
predictions.  
Data analysis and modeling methods: A PBPK model previously developed for imatinib was used, and 
the  model  parameters  were  modified  using  growth  and  maturation  database  obtained  from  the 
literature.  Clearance  range  observed  in  phase  III  trial  in  adult  population  was  used  as  reference  for 
paediatric  scaling.  Two  separate  approaches  were  employed:  1)  steady-state  (SS-Model)  approach 
scaling  only  clearance  to  predict  steady-state  AUC,  and  2)  dynamic  (Dyn-Model)  PK  simulation  to 
assess  the  imatinib  concentration-time  profile  within  a  dosing  interval.  The  effects  of  body  size  and 
blood  perfusion  on  the  PK  profiles  were  evaluated  in  addition  to  maturation  in  clearance.  The  model 
evaluations  were  conducted  by  comparing  the  predicted  steady-state  AUC  and  predicted  imatinib 
concentration-time profile with noncompartmental AUC computed by the trapezoidal rule and observed

2.3.2.2.  Results 
Pooled Population Pharmacokinetics Modeling 
The popPK of imatinib was characterised by a one-compartment model with zero- order absorption and 
first-order elimination. The model was parameterised in terms of apparent clearance (CL/F), apparent 
volume of distribution (V/F), and duration of zero-order input (D1). Inter-individual variability in CL/F 
and  V/F  were  characterised  by  lognormal  distributions  and  the  residual  error  by  a  combined  error 
model.  Analysis  of  covariate  effects  revealed  that  CL/F  and  V/F  increased  with  body  surface  area 
(BSA).  After  correcting  for  the  BSA  effect,  the  following  covariates  were  not  found  to  have  clinically 
significant effects on the exposure of imatinib: age, gender, race, WBC, hemoglobin, body weight, BMI, 
and  disease type.  The  clearance  for  a  subject  whose  BSA=1.73  m2  was  9.06  L/h,  which  corresponds 
with the estimates from previous works in adult populations.  
There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  imatinib  clearance  among  disease  types  Ph+  CML, 
Ph+  ALL  and  Other  (Figure  01).  Clearance  for  patients  with  Ph+  ALL  were  estimated  to  have  an 
imatinib clearance 9.7% (SE=15.9%) less than that for Ph+ CML.  
Figure 01: Imatinib clearance normalized to BSA=1.73m2 by disease type (N=67) 
Comparison  of  the  relation  between  clearance  and  body  weight  in  the  final  model  with  a  previously 
developed adult model shows that the models are consistent with each other for body weights of 60 kg 
and  higher.  Refitting  the  final  model  without  the  subjects  younger  than  4  years  led  to  similar 
parameter  estimates.  Prediction  of  concentration-time  profiles  for  the  excluded  subjects  showed  that 
the  observed  concentrations  were  generally  within  the  predicted  90%  variability  bands.  The  popPK 
model was used to extrapolate AUC for one year old children. The uncertainty was greater for one year 
than two year old. Slightly lower exposures were observed for 1 year old as compared to 2 year and 
above.  
The  popPK  of  CGP74588  was  characterised  by  a  two-compartment  model  parameterised  in  terms  of 
apparent  clearance  (CLM/F),  apparent  volumes  of  the  central  compartment  (VCM/F)  and  peripheral 
compartment  (VPM/F),  and  the  apparent  inter-compartmental  clearance  (QM/F).  The  fraction  of 
imatinib metabolised to CGP74588, a scaling factor in parent/metabolite modeling, was fixed to 0.13 or 
13%.  The  final  popPK  model  for  CGP74588  includes  BSA  as  a  covariate  with  clearances  and  volumes 
increasing with BSA.

The  exposure  of  18-year  old  subjects  (dosing  scheme  of  340  mg/m2  not  to  exceed  600  mg)  was 
simulated using the adult model by Schmidli et al. (2005). As can be seen in Figure 02, the exposure 
of children in different age groups (simulated from the final popPK model in this report) for 340 mg/m2 
capped at 600 mg corresponds closely to the exposure of adults simulated using the model by Schmidli 
et al. (2005).  
Figure 02: Simulated AUC by age group for 304 mg/m2 not to exceed at 600 mg dose, compared against 
adults simulated with the adult model receiving 600 mg fixed dose 
Model-based  simulation  of  various  dosing  schemes  showed  that  doses  of  260  mg/m2  not  to  exceed 
400 mg or 340 mg/m2 not to exceed 600 mg lead to relatively constant exposures (AUC, Cmax, and 
Cmin) across the range of observed body surface areas and ages. The AUCs achieved by these doses 
are similar to adult AUCs.  
Physiologically-based PK (PBPK) Modeling Report 
The  SS-Model  simulations  showed  that  the  majority  of  actual  steady-state  AUC  values  (94%;  29/31) 
normalised  to  340  mg/m2  in  paediatric  patients  fell  within  the  0.5  and  99.5  percentiles  of  model 
projected  range  scaled  from  adult  measurements.  Based  on  the  Dyn-  Model,  the  predicted  plasma 
concentration-time profiles were generally in good agreements for most paediatric subjects, except for 
younger subjects ≤ 2 years old, for which the exposure appeared to be over-predicted. The predicted 
deviation from adult was higher for the first dose than at steady state (Day 28). The largest deviation 
was  observed  for  Cmax.  The  predicted  age  effect  on  AUC  and  trough  (Cmin)  were  less  than  that  on 
Cmax. The differences in predictions of children and adults seem to be the mixed results of changing 
distribution  volume  and  blood  circulating  turnover,  in  addition  to  clearance  maturation  with  age. 
Improvement  of  model  prediction  could be  achieved  for  the  young  subjects  by  refining  certain  model 
assumptions  or  parameters,  such  as  assuming  different  plasma  protein  maturation  in  cancer  patients 
from healthy subjects, or a lower extent of oral absorption for those age groups instead of a complete 
absorption,  considering  the  immaturity  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  Nonetheless,  taking  a 
“conservative approach” for the model assumptions, the prediction was only 1.5-fold of the adult value 
at  1  year  age,  suggesting  a  safe  application  of  PBPK  approach  in  scaling  imatinib  clearance  down  to 
children at 1 year of age.

Figure  03:  PBPK  modelling:  comparison  of  model  simulated  plasma  imatinib  concentration  and  the 
measurement  from  four  clinical  syudies  (N=67  patients  with  concentrations  normalized  to  340mg/m2 
dose) 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
The  dosing  scheme  for  paediatric  Ph+  ALL  derives  from  the  pooled  population  pharmacokinetic 
analysis, the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling analysis, experience from paediatric CML 
population  and  extrapolation  from  adult  Ph+  ALL  population.  To  achieve  comparable  exposures  in 
paediatric patients corresponding to target exposure in adult patients, body surface area (BSA) based 
dosing should be employed in the dose administration of imatinib in paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL. 
The  proposed  posology  of  340  mg/m2  in  paediatric  patients  from  1  to  18  years  of  age  seems 
appropriate.

Studies  STI571I2301  (Schultz  et  al.  2008;  Schultz  et  al.,  2009)  and  STI571AIT07  supporting  this 
application were conducted and monitored by cooperative groups in the US and Europe, respectively.

2.4.1.  Main study 
A Children’s Oncology Group pilot study for the treatment of very high risk (VHR) acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia in children and adolescents (COG AALL0031, STI571I2301).  
Methods 
Study participants 
The study population consisted of paediatric patients with VHR ALL, defined as those patients who have 
an expected 5-year EFS of < 45% (Schultz et al., 2007. Criteria identified for VHR were:  
 
Ph+ ALL identified by  
  BCR-ABL expression by PCR or fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH)  
 
t(9;22)(q34;q31) by cytogenetics  
  Hypodiploidy (chromosomes <44) by cytogenetics  
  DNA index <0.81 by flow cytometry  
  MLL gene rearrangement with slow early response (SER); SER is defined as M3 (>25% blasts) 
bone  marrow  (BM)  on  day  7  (high  risk  patients)  or  an  M2  (5%-25%  blasts)  /M3  (>25%) 
marrow on day 14 (standard risk patients) of induction.  
Other  patients  presumed  to  have  a  poor  outcome  and  classified  as  VHR  were  those  with  persistent 
measurable disease following induction in a frontline study defined by bone marrow and MRD status at 
the end of induction.  
Eligibility for entry into the COG AALL0031 protocol for VHR ALL required a central confirmation of Ph+ 
ALL, hypodiploidy or MLL rearrangement with slow early response (SER).  
Patients were included who met the following criteria: 
•  Male  or  female  patients,  aged  1  to  <  22  years,  who  themselves  or  the  legally  authorised 
representatives have given informed consent  
•  Ph+ ALL:  
•  BCR/ABL by FISH or RT-PCR  
• 
t(9;22)(q34;q11) detected by cytogenetics  
•  Chromosomes < 44 by cytogenetics  
•  DNA index < 0.81 by flow cytometry  
•  Any  rearrangement  of  chromosome  11  that  resulted  in  disruption  of  MLL  (gene  11q23)  by 
cytogenetics and slow early response (SER).  
Induction failures were defined prior to study entry as:  
• 
•  Patients with a bone marrow (BM) status of M3 (> 25% blasts) at the end of standard  
induction therapy, enrolled within 42 days of diagnosis  
•  Patients with a BM status  of M2 (5-25% blasts) or MRD ≥ 1% (by flow cytometry) at 
the  end  of  induction  therapy  who  still  had  M2  (or  M3)  or  MRD  ≥  1  %  at  the  end  of 
extended  induction,  enrolled  within  14  days  of  their  last  day  of  extended  induction 
therapy  
Those who failed induction therapy or extended induction therapy were allowed to enrol into this study, 
irrespective  of  haematological  values  provided  there  was  no  active  infection  or  immediate  life- 
threatening organ malfunction.  
Patients  were  enrolled  after  receiving  a  3  -  4  drug  Induction  regimen  either  on,  or  identical  to,  a 
frontline  COG,  POG,  or  CCG  trial  for  ALL.  These  induction  regimens  included  intravenous  (iv) 
vincristine,  a  corticosteroid  such  as  prednisone  or  dexamethasone  p.o.,  L-asparaginase  (either  native 
or  pegylated)  iv,  and  with  or  without  an  anthracycline  such  as  daunorubicin  iv.  Additionally,  patients 
received  intrathecal  therapy  with  methotrexate,  with  or  without  cytarabine,  and  with  or  without  a 
corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone.

Removal of patients from therapy or assessment 
The Study  Chair of COG  was to be contacted prior to removing any patient from protocol therapy for 
toxicity. 
The following criteria for removal from protocol treatment were pre-defined: 
• M2 (5-25%) or M3 (> 25% blasts) bone marrow at the end of Consolidation 2 
• Relapse (BM, CNS, testicular or other) at any site, during the study 
• Secondary malignancy during the study 
• Refusal of further protocol therapy 
After  removal  from  protocol  therapy  (chemotherapy  with  imatinib  or  HSCT  with  imatinib),  patients 
went  into  study  follow-up.  The  following  criteria  for  removal  from  study  follow-up,  referred  to  as  “off 
study” were pre-defined in the protocol: 
• Confirmed as lost to follow-up 
• Withdrawal of informed consent for further follow-up 
• Entry into another COG therapeutic study

Figure 04: Study Design 
Imatinib  was  supplied  as  100  mg  tablets  in  polyethylene  bottles  and  was  given  orally.  Imatinib  was 
given on a daily dosing schedule for 21 days or continuously, depending on the cohort and treatment 
blocks.  Treatment  blocks  started  when  the  following  criteria  were  met:  ANC  ≥  750/μL;  platelets  ≥ 
75,000/μL;  ALT  <  20x  the  upper  limit of  normal;  direct  bilirubin  and  creatinine  normal  for  age.  After 
count recovery was met, then patients continued the next treatment block and resumed imatinib. 
The tolerability of the addition of imatinib to the chemotherapy regimen was unknown prior to the start 
of the trial. Thus, the tolerability of imatinib was assessed by incorporating it into 5 sequential cohorts 
of  patients  that  incorporated  it  both  earlier  in  the  course  of  treatment  and  during  more  treatment 
blocks. (Figure 2, see below). The duration of imatinib increased from 42 days (cohort 1) to 210 days 
(cohort 5) prior to maintenance cycles.

Dose selection 
The imatinib dose selection was made based on results from a previous phase I study (Champagne et 
al.,  2004).  In  this  study  oral  imatinib  was  administered  daily  at  dose levels  ranging  from  260  to  570 
mg/m2.  There  were  31  children  who  received  479  courses  of  imatinib  and  a  maximum  tolerated 
dosage was not defined. The authors concluded that daily oral imatinib was well tolerated in children at 
doses  ranging  from  260  to  570  mg/m2.  Doses  of  260  and  340  mg/m2  provided  systemic  exposures 
similar to those of adults who were treated with daily doses of 400 and 600 mg, respectively.  
The  imatinib  dose  given  was  340  mg/m2/d  or  230  mg/m2/d.  Paediatric  doses  were  calculated 
according to body surface area. The dosing increment of 50 mg, as was the case for the 150 mg and 
250 mg doses, was accomplished by dividing a divisible 100 mg film-coated tablet. 
Table 01: 
Table 02: 
Imatinib dose adjustments 
The individual imatinib dose of 340 mg/m2/d was reduced to 230 mg/m2/d for patients who could not 
tolerate  340  mg/m2/d.  In  addition,  the  decision  to  reduce  the  dose  from  340  mg/m2/d  to  230 
mg/m2/d  was  taken  at  interim  monitoring,  if  dose  limiting  toxicities  (DLT)  were  observed  within  a 
cohort  or  within  a  specific  treatment  block.  According  to  the  protocol,  a  DLT  was  monitored 
continuously  and  administered  imatinib  was  to  be  decreased  by  30%  (230  mg/m2/d)  if  grade  3  or  4 
nonhematopoietic toxicity was observed in 2 of the first evaluable 6 patients within a cohort. If at any 
time  for  the  remaining  patients  in  the  cohort,  the  percentage  of  DLT  for  the  full  group  of  evaluable 
patients reached 33%, this also resulted in dose modification. If DLTs were observed within a specific

treatment  block,  then  reduction  of  dose  would  only  apply  to  that  specific  treatment  block  where 
unacceptable toxicity had been observed. 
Imatinib treatment post-HSCT 
Per  protocol  HSCT  was  performed  by  a  COG-approved  HSCT/  Bone  Marrow  Transplant  (BMT)  center. 
The  HSCT  regimen  consisted  of  a  1-week  preparative  regimen  including  Total  Body  Irradiation  (TBI), 
CPM,  etoposide,  and  GVHD  prophylaxis  (of  MTX  and  cyclosporine).  Patients  with  an  HLA-matched 
related donor could proceed with HSCT after Consolidation 2. 
Imatinib (230 mg/m2/d) started between weeks 16-24 post-HSCT when ANC ≥ 750/μL, platelet count 
≥ 75,000/μL, and non-haematological toxicities had resolved to ≤ Grade 1. Imatinib dose increased to 
340  mg/m2/d  between  weeks  20-28  post-HSCT,  after  no  toxicities  of  ≥  Grade  3  toxicities  were 
observed (Table 03). The total duration of imatinib treatment post-HSCT was 24 weeks. 
Table 03: Imatinib dose schedule for patients undergoing HSCT 
HSCT 
In this study, patients with HLA-matched related donors or 1 antigen mismatched (excluding HLA-DR 
mismatch)  related  donors  were  eligible  to  receive  HSCT  after  the  two  initial  consolidation 
chemotherapy blocks if a matched related donor was available.  
At any time during the protocol therapy, patients and their families had an option to be removed from 
protocol treatment to obtain off protocol HSCT (that did not meet per protocol HSCT criteria). 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study as defined by the COG in the actual protocol was to determine the 
feasibility of patient accrual and toxicity of an intensified chemotherapeutic regimen (including imatinib 
for  Ph+  ALL  patients)  for  treatment  of  children  and  adolescents  with  VHR  ALL.  Over  time  it  was 
apparent that both patient accrual and the toxicity profile were feasible. It was observed that the Ph+ 
ALL patients appeared to have improved EFS compared to what the expected outcome was based on 
historical control data from clinical trials performed by COG and its precursor organisations. Thus the 
primary focus of the trial shifted to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of imatinib and 
chemotherapy for patients with Ph+ ALL  
For  this  report,  in  order  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  imatinib  integrated  into  an  intense  chemotherapy 
regimen in Ph+ ALL patients the following objectives were defined: 
Primary objective 
The primary objective was to assess the event-free survival (EFS; events defined as relapse at any site, 
secondary malignancy, or death from any cause) in Ph+ ALL paediatric patients in cohort 5, from study 
entry, including the option of HSCT treatment. 
Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives were: 
•  To  assess  the  overall  survival  (OS;  event:  death  from  any  cause)  in  Ph+  ALL  patients,  from  study 
entry, including the option of HSCT treatment. 
• To evaluate the exposure-response of imatinib per cohort, and combined cohort groups, at endpoints 
EFS and OS. 
•  To  compare  EFS  and  OS  in  patients  receiving  chemotherapy  plus  imatinib  in  cohort  5  versus  all 
patients undergoing HSCT (on and off protocol), including and excluding induction failures in all groups 
•  To  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  adding  imatinib  to  intensive  chemotherapy  in  Ph+  ALL 
patients  (including  HSCT),  specifically  in  cohort  5;  stating  the  impact  of  imatinib  in  addition  to 
chemotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/378913/2013  
Page 17/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  To  compare  the  safety  profile  in  patients  receiving  intensive  chemotherapy  plus  imatinib  versus 
patients undergoing per protocol HSCT. 
Additional exploratory evaluations (i.e. EFS and OS from start of diagnosis; prognostic effect of MRD, 
etc.) and sensitivity analyses (i.e. EFS including induction failure as an event) were performed. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint is event free survival for both the COG analyses (Schultz et al 2007b, Schultz et 
al 2009) and the Novartis analyses. EFS, defined as the time between study entry and the earliest of 
the  following  events:  leukemic  relapse  (BM,  CNS,  testicular,  or  other)  at  any  site,  secondary 
malignancy,  or  death.  OS,  a  secondary  endpoint,  was  defined  as  the  time  between  study  entry  and 
death  due  to  any  cause.  However,  there  is  some  variation  in  the  definition  of  EFS  used  by  COG  and 
Novartis,  in  terms  of  inclusion/exclusion  of  patients  who  failed  induction  therapy  and  considering 
induction  failure  (IF)  as  an  ‘event.’  Table  04  shows  how  data  from  induction failures  were  handled  in 
different documents. 
Study  STI571I2301  included  patients  failing  induction  therapy  as  well  as  patients  who  responded  to 
initial induction treatment, whereas the historical control group did not include any induction failures. 
Novartis  conducted  EFS  analyses  including  induction  failure  patients  and  provided  the  results  in  two 
ways:  first,  by  not  treating  these  patients  as  having  had  an  event  and  second,  by  treating  these 
patients  who  failed  induction  treatment  as  having  an  event.  This  latter  definition  of  EFS  was  aligned 
with the analysis performed by Schultz et al (2009). 
Table 04: Handling of patients who failed induction treatment in EFS analyses (STI571l2301) 
The predictive value of MRD (by multi-parameter flow cytometry) to EFS was also an exploratory 
endpoint. MRD was assessed at study entry (after induction) and after the first and second blocks of 
consolidation. Measurements were performed at a single central reference laboratory. 
Sample size 
Sample size considerations were based on practical grounds such as recruitment time. It was planned 
to recruit 12 patients into each of the 5 cohorts. Accrual into Cohort 1 was stopped at 7 patients 
because data became available that showed that imatinib could be administered in combination with 
high-dose methotrexate in the Hyper-CVAD regimen. Cohort 5 was expanded to accrue a total of 50 
patients in order to provide a more precise estimate of outcome once it became clear that the 
combination of imatinib and chemotherapy was tolerable and appeared to be improving patient 
outcome based on the improved EFS observed in Cohorts 3 plus 4 compared to Cohorts 1 plus 2. 
According to the COG original protocol the estimation of precision was as follows: with the original 
cohort size of 12, a 90% confidence interval provides a half-width of approximately 24% that was the 
Assessment report  
EMA/378913/2013  
Page 18/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
true EFS result could be 24% higher or lower depending upon the observed estimate. Increasing the 
size of the final cohort to 50 patients reduced the half-width of the confidence interval to 12% to 
provide reasonable precision.

Statistical methods 
The analyses described in this section are those performed for the purpose of the analysis of Ph+ ALL 
patients who received imatinib integrated into the chemotherapy regimen as defined in the protocol for 
this study designed by COG for VHR ALL patients 
Data cut-off 
A snapshot of the data as of 5-Sep-2009 was received from COG and used for the analyses presented 
in  this  report.  Last  patient  last  visit  (LPLV)  for  Ph+  ALL  patients  who  completed  protocol  treatment 
occurred  on  8-Jan-2009,  hence  all  protocol  treatment  visits  were  included.  In  addition,  the  follow-up 
data for patients in the study follow-up period (up to the data cutoff date of 5-SEP-2009) was included 
in this dataset. 
Populations 
The  following  analysis  sets  were  defined  and  are  based  on  all  Ph+  patients  who  consented  to 
participate in this study: 
• 
Enrolled  set:  All  eligible  Ph+  patients  enrolled  into  the  study.  Data  of  one  Ph+  patient  from 
cohort 1 was inevaluable according to COG, because this patient was inadvertently dosed with 
imatinib  during  consolidation  1.  Per  protocol,  patients  in  cohort  1  do  not  receive  imatinib  in 
consolidation  1.  According  to  COG,  very  limited  information  was  entered  by  the  site.  COG 
decided to remove patient’s data from their analyses and did not provide this patient’s data to 
Novartis. 
•  Safety set: All patients from the enrolled set who received at least one dose of chemotherapy 
and/or imatinib starting at Consolidation 1. 
• 
Efficacy set: All patients from the safety set qualified for the efficacy analyses 
Definition of primary efficacy endpoint 
The  primary  endpoint  was  EFS  calculated  as  the  time  (months)  from  the  date  of  first  treatment  with 
study medication in Consolidation 1 (study entry) to first event or last contact (assuming that the date 
of last contact is equivalent to the last disease assessment), where an event was defined as: relapse at 
any site, secondary malignancy, death from any cause. 
Patients who did not fail were censored as of the date of last EFS assessment, which was the date of 
last contact, since it was assumed that relapse was assessed at every visit. Table 03 summarises the 
definition of EFS and the censoring algorithm.

Table 05: Definition of primary event-free survival 
Efficacy analysis 
The  analysis  of  EFS  was  conducted  on  the  efficacy  population  using  data  received  from  COG  (with 
data  cut-off  date  of  05-Sep-2009).  All  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  on  the  efficacy  set  and  in 
subgroups as indicated. The primary patient group for efficacy was cohort 5. 
There  was  no  formal  comparison  with  the  historical  control  data  because  COG  did  not  provide  the 
individual  patient  data.  Instead,  COG  provided  the  respective  results  for  the  efficacy  endpoint,  by 
sending  the  yearly  estimated  EFS  rates  with  95%  confidence  intervals  (based  on  Kaplan  Meier 
method) to Novartis. The historical control data (n=120) were from previous POG studies (ALinC 14: 
POG  8602,  ALinC15:  POG  9005  and  9006,  ALinC16:  POG  9201,  9405,  9406  and  9605).  Historical 
control  data  that  were  obtained  consisted  of  Ph+  ALL  patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  with  or 
without HSCT between 1988 and 1995. Only estimated EFS rates were provided to Novartis; no data 
on OS or other subgroup data from the historical control was provided by COG. 
The following comparisons for EFS and OS were performed as appropriate (including induction failures 
for the main analyses if not otherwise stated).  
• by cohort: cohort 5 vs. cohorts 1+2, cohort 5 vs. cohorts 3+4, and cohort 5 vs. cohorts 1 to 4 
•  by  HSCT:  cohort  5  chemotherapy  +  imatinib  vs.  per  protocol  HSCT  and  vs.  off  protocol  HSCT; 
cohort 5 chemotherapy + imatinib vs. overall HSCT (per protocol and off protocol HSCT) 
• by risk groups: 
• NCI risk group: standard risk vs. high risk 
• Baseline age: < 10 vs. ≥ 10 years 
• WBC at diagnosis: < 50,000/μL vs. ≥ 50,000/μL; < 100,000/μL vs. ≥ 100,000/μL 
• Induction failure: no vs. yes 
• MRD at study entry: ≤ 0.01% vs. > 0.01%; ≤ 0.1% vs. > 0.1%; ≤ 1.0% vs. > 1.0%. 
The  primary  endpoint  analysis  was  performed  on  all  patient  data  for  cohort  5;  no  comparison  was 
foreseen  for  the  primary  endpoint.  Therefore,  respective  results  were  presented  using  descriptive 
statistics  only.  The  EFS  rates  were  calculated  from  date  of  study  entry.  Cohort  5  efficacy  results 
(estimated  EFS  rates)  were  presented  side  by  side  with  the  historical  control  estimated  EFS  rates 
including 95 % confidence intervals. No induction failures were included in the historical control data; 
however, cohort 5 included patients who failed induction therapy. 
Overall survival was calculated in months from the date of study entry (as the start date) to the date 
of death (due to any cause) or date of last contact (for those who are still alive). For any comparisons 
the log-rank test was applied

Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  160  paediatric  VHR  ALL  patients  were  enrolled  in  this  study  between  14-Oct-2002  and  20-
Oct-2006. Ninety-three (93) were Ph+ patients and received imatinib in addition to the chemotherapy 
regimen.  There  was  one  Ph+  patient  from  cohort  1  that  COG  considered  not  evaluable  because  this 
patient was inadvertently dosed with imatinib during consolidation 1. Per protocol, patients in cohort 1 
do not receive imatinib in consolidation 1. Data for this patient was not provided to Novartis because 
very  limited  information  was  entered  by  the  site  when  COG  decided  to  remove  this  patient  from  all 
study analyses. Hence 92 patients were included in this analysis. 
Figure 05: Patient population in Study STI571I2301 
Fifty-seven (62.0%) patients received previous chemotherapy induction treatment (no imatinib) in one 
of  the  CCG,  POG,  or  COG  frontline  studies;  the  remaining  35  (38%)  patients  underwent  a  similar 
induction  therapy  as  that  defined  in  the  protocol  including  vincristine,  asparaginase,  and 
prednisone/dexamethasone, with or without daunorubicin.

Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended seven times. The main amendments were: 
  Amendment  1  (13-Jul-2003)  modified  the  AALL0031  design  for  Ph+  patients  to  investigate  a 
more  accelerated  integration  of  imatinib  into  the  therapeutic  blocks.  Also,  the  overall  number 
of cohorts of Ph+ patients was reduced. Following the implementation of this amendment, four 
cohorts of Ph+ patients (cohorts 2-5) were studied, and the last of these cohorts (if reached) 
was to use “continuous” dosing with imatinib (i.e., given in each of the blocks: Consolidation 1 
and 2, Reinduction 1 and 2, Intensification 1 and 2, and each Maintenance cycle).  
In Amendment 5B (23-May-2005) the following changes were implemented:  
 
• 
• 
an expanded definition of patient categories eligible for the study (MLL patients with a 
slow  early  response  determined  by  day  15  marrow  or  end  induction  MRD),  and  a 
modification of the low hypodiploid criterion to be those with < 44 chromosomes,  
an  extended  study  duration  by  approximately  16  months  in  order  to  expand  the  last 
cohort of Ph+ patients,

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy results 
Continuous  exposure  to  imatinib  improved  the  outcome  in  cohort  5  patients.  Fourteen  patients  in 
cohort 5 showed any event for EFS: 9 patients had a relapse at any site; and 5 patients died (without 
a  relapse  prior  to  death).  Of  these  5  patients  who  died,  4  underwent  HSCT  and  1  patient  received 
chemotherapy plus imatinib.

Ancillary analyses 
1.  Event free survival was analysed for cohort 5 and the historical control population considering 
the  baseline  characteristics  of  age  at  study  start,  gender,  WBC  at  diagnosis,  and  CNS 
involvement (standard factors to assess risk of relapse in this population) and the results are 
summarised in Table 13. All EFS results are presented with hazard ratios (HR) and confidence 
intervals (CI) comparing cohort 5 with historical control using the Kaplan Meier method

Table 13: 
2.  A multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis  for EFS comparing cohort 5 with historical 
control  was  performed  using  baseline  characteristics  of  age,  gender  and  WBC  as  covariates 
which could have potentially influenced the EFS results.  
The  exclusion  of  IFs  from  the  historical  control  group  contributed  to  a  conservative  approach 
for comparisons because IFs have a higher risk of events. MRD status was not available for the 
historical control group, therefore, it was not considered in the analysis. Since few patients in 
either  group  had  CNS  involvement,  this  factor  was  not  considered  in  the  analysis.  Therefore, 
despite being considered important parameters for risk assessment, IF status, MRD status, and 
CNS  involvement  could  not  be  included  in  the  multivariate  Cox  regression  analysis  for  EFS 
between the historical control group and cohort 5.  
When  adjusting  for  all  factors  to  account  for  any  imbalances  between  cohort  5  and  the 
historical control group, the hazard ratio for EFS remains in favour of cohort 5 compared with 
the historical control (HR=0.28, log-rank p<0.0001)

Table 14: 
3.  Prognostic factors for EFS in cohort 5 chemotherapy plus imatinib only 
In addition, the following parameters were assessed as prognostic factors for EFS: sex (female 
/ male), race (white / other, age group (< 10 years / ≥ 10 years), MRD status at study entry 
(≤ 0.01% / >0.01%) and WBC (< 50,000/μL / ≥ 50,000/μL). CNS status could not be used as 
a prognostic factor for these analyses due to the low number of patients with CNS2 and CNS3 
status  at  study  entry.  All  of  the  above  parameters  were  examined  for  their  effect  on  EFS 
(univariate).  Only  those  parameters  who  showed  a  significant  effect  of  p  ≤  0.1  were  to  be 
entered into a multivariate model and keeping only those in the final multivariate model which 
showed a significant effect on EFS with p ≤ 0.05 using a step-wise selection procedure. 
As  a  result,  only  the  WBC  at  study  entry  was  independently  prognostic,  showing  a  significant 
effect  in  the  univariate  case  with  a  hazard  ratio  of  14.28  with  p=0.0142  by  the  Wald-test. 
Since  none  of  the  other  parameters  were  significant  for  entering  into  the  multivariate  model, 
the multivariate model was left only with WBC count as a prognostic factor resulting in a lower 
risk of EFS events for patients in the group WBC < 50,000/μL at study start. 
4.  Prognostic factors for Event-Free Survival 
In addition, the following parameters were assessed as prognostic factors for EFS: sex (female 
/ male), race (white / other, age group (< 10 years / ≥ 10 years), MRD status at study entry 
(≤ 0.01% / > 0.01%) and WBC (< 50,000/μL / ≥ 50,000/μL). CNS status could not be used as 
a prognostic factor for these analyses due to the low number of patients with CNS2 and CNS3 
status at study entry. Only the WBC at study entry was prognostic, showing a hazard ratio of 
14.28 with a p-value of 0.0142 by the Wald-test 
5.  Effect of HSCT on EFS and OS 
The estimated EFS at 4 years following per protocol HSCT was lower than the EFS in cohort 5 
with an estimated rate of 65.3% vs. 73.7%, respectively; the log-rank test yielded a HR=0.62 
and a p-value of 0.374. A similar result was observed when comparing the estimated EFS at 4 
years following off protocol HSCT with an estimated EFS rate of 50.5%; this difference showed 
a HR=0.38 and a p-value of 0.0732

6.  EFS with HSCT versus chemotherapy + imatinib adjusting for baseline characteristics using Cox 
regression analysis  
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate any baseline risk factors which might have biased 
the  EFS  result  for  the  comparison  of  treatment  options:  HSCT  (per  protocol  HSCT  or  off 
protocol HSCT) vs. cohort 5 chemotherapy + imatinib. EFS was evaluated by multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards analysis by entering HSCT status (yes/no) as a time dependent covariate 
into the model in addition to age (<10 years / ≥10 years), sex, race, MRD status (≤0.01% / 
>0.01%)  and  WBC  count  at  study  entry  (<  50,000/μL  /  ≥  50,000/μL).  Event  time  was 
calculated both from date of diagnosis in and from date of study entry using HSCT as not time-
dependent in.  
Due  to  missing  values  in  some  baseline  factors  (e.g.  MRD  at  baseline),  data  from  only  56 
patients  were  kept  for  the  Cox  regression  model.  When  the  comparison  of  HSCT  vs.  cohort  5 
chemotherapy + imatinib was adjusted for all baseline factors, the result was not different.  
7.  EFS of cohort 5 by induction failure status  
The comparison by log-rank test was statistically significant (p=0.054) but this result has to be 
seen  in  the  light  that  some  patients  underwent  HSCT  and  therefore  may  have  contributed  to 
the  treatment  effect.  Only  six  patients  in  cohort  5  were  classified  as  induction  failures;  3  of 
them  did  not  show  an  EFS  event  at  the  time  of  analyses.  The  estimated  EFS  rates  at  36 
months were 81.4% in patients who did not fail the induction treatment and 44.4% in patients 
who failed the induction treatment. 
8.  EFS by MRD  
The impact of MRD at ≤ 0.01% vs. > 0.01% at end induction on estimated EFS rate for cohort 
5 was: (88.2% vs. 76.9%) at 3 years and (88.2% vs. 64.0%) at 4 years  
Overall  results  of  all  cohorts  showed  that  there  was  a  trend  over  time  of  an  increasing 
percentage of patients having a non-measurable MRD of ≤ 0.01%: 29.9% of patients at study 
entry; 66.7% patients at end of Consolidation 1; and 71.9% at end of Consolidation 2  
For cohort 5: 10 out of 44 patients (22.7%) had > 1% MRD at study entry,  only 2 out of 36 
patients (5.6%) still had > 1% MRD at the end of Consolidation 1. The remaining 31 patients 
had ≤ 1% MRD (and none had > 1% MRD) at end of Consolidation 2.  
9.  EFS by NCI risk 
Assessment report

EFS in cohort 5 revealed a significant difference between standard and high-risk (NCI) group. 
No  event  was  recorded  in  the  13  patients  of  the  standard  risk  group  of  cohort  5  resulting  in 
estimated EFS at 3 years of 100% and a non estimable hazard ratio.  
Sensitivity analyses 
1.  EFS by cohort group, from diagnosis (treating induction failure as an event)  
2.  EFS of cohort 5 from diagnosis  
The Kaplan-Meier analysis of EFS in cohort 5 revealed identical estimated EFS rates at 4 years 
in  both  analyses:  when  using  either  date  of  diagnosis  or  date  of  study  entry  for  EFS 
calculation; with 4-year EFS being 69.6%  
Updated efficacy data: 
COG conducted analyses with 5 year follow-up and a manuscript with these data is being prepared. 
COG confirmed their 5 year analyses contain only efficacy data and there is no update on safety. Upon 
request, COG provided the 5 year Kaplan-Meier estimates comparing EFS in patients receiving imatinib 
and chemotherapy with patients receiving related or unrelated bone marrow transplant.

Figure 09 compares patients in cohort 5 without HSCT with patients in all cohorts with related or 
unrelated HSCT. Figure 10 compares patients exclusively within cohort 5—those without HSCT and 
those with related or unrelated HSCT. Please note the terms related and unrelated bone marrow 
transplant (BMT) used by COG in the figures below, correspond to the definition of per protocol and 
off-protocol definitions in STI571I2301 study, respectively. Per protocol HSCT are HSCT with a HLA-
matched related donor or 1 antigen mismatched and off-protocol HSCT are the rest.

10: 
The 5 year update on efficacy shows that the probability of EFS is comparable between patients 
receiving only imatinib + chemotherapy vs patients receiving related HSCT vs patients receiving 
unrelated HSCT. With one additional year of follow-up it is confirmed that the addition of imatinib to 
chemotherapy results in comparable long term outcomes to those with HSCT.  
Upon request, COG provided the following table describing EFS (from time of diagnosis) analyses 
comparing cohorts 1+2, cohorts 3+4, cohort 5, Ph negative patients and historical controls.

Supportive study(ies) 
Study STI571AIT07 
This study was designed and conducted by 10 participating national paediatric leukaemia study groups 
in Europe (EsPhALL). Study STI571AIT07 was initially designed as an open-label, randomised study to 
determine  whether  the  addition  of  imatinib  to  standard  chemotherapy  extended  DFS  in  paediatric 
patients with Ph+ ALL.  
Patients  who  achieved  complete  remission  (CR)  following  frontline  induction  therapy  were  defined  as 
Good risk and were randomised to receive imatinib + chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Patients 
who  did  not  achieve  CR  following  frontline  induction  therapy  were  defined  as  Poor  risk,  were  not 
randomised,  and  all  of  these  patients  received  imatinib  +  chemotherapy.  However,  after  the 
publication  of  interim  results  from  Study  STI571I2301  by  Schultz  et  al  (2009)  which  showed  the 
benefit  of  adding  imatinib  to  chemotherapy  to  paediatric  patients  of  all  risk  with  Ph+  ALL,  the 
participating groups no longer considered it acceptable to randomise patients into a chemotherapy only 
arm. Therefore the protocol was amended so that all patients would receive imatinib regardless of risk 
category. As a result of the amendment, the study enrolled an insufficient sample size to properly test 
for the primary efficacy analysis. Additional factors confounding efficacy results included the following: 
the  impact  of  the  therapeutic  effect  of  HSCT  since  a  high  percentage  (85.2%)  of  patients  were 
transplanted within the study; and 12/44 (27%) patients randomised to receive no imatinib switched 
arms to receive imatinib prior to the amendment, thus diluting treatment effects.  
Consequently,  data  from  study  [STI571AIT07]  are  included  to  provide  additional  safety  data  and  are 
considered to be supportive only.

Figure 11: 
Patients  with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  Ph+  ALL  were  enrolled  into  the  study  after  receiving  initial 
induction  chemotherapy  according  to  national  group  protocols  (Phase  IA).  Patients  were  stratified  as 
Poor risk (i.e. poor prognosis) or Good risk (i.e. good prognosis), as defined below: 
•  Poor  risk  group:  patients  who  were  prednisone-poor  responders,  i.e.  blast  cell  count  ≥  1000/μl  in 
peripheral  blood  after  7  days  of  prednisone  given  in  combination  with  intrathecal  (IT)  methotrexate 
(MTX), or having a M3 bone marrow (BM) at day 15 or M2/M3 (see definitions below) BM at day 21 or 
lack of a complete remission (CR) after the induction course. 
•  Good  risk  group:  patients  who  were  prednisone-good  responders,  i.e.  blast  cell  count  <1000/μl  in 
peripheral blood  after  7  days  of  prednisone  given  in  combination  with  IT  MTX,  or  having  M1/M2  (see 
definitions below) BM at day 15 or M1 BM at day 21 and achieved CR after the induction course. 
M1, M2, M3 are defined as follows: 
•  M1:  <5%  blasts,  counting  all  nucleated  cells,  including  erythropoiesis.  In  case  of  regenerating 
marrow with a high erythropoietic predominance, at least a total count of 100 non-erythropoietic cells 
should be counted. 
•  M2:  5-25%  blasts,  counting  all  nucleated  cells,  including  erythropoiesis.  In  case  of  regenerating 
marrow with a high erythropoietic predominance, at least a total count of 100 non-erythropoietic cells 
should be counted. 
• M3: >25% blasts in a BM aspirate. 
All Poor risk patients received imatinib in combination with intensive chemotherapy. Good risk patients 
were  randomised  to  receive  either  imatinib  in  combination  with  intensive  chemotherapy  or  intensive 
chemotherapy  alone.  After  induction  therapy,  all  patients  continued  with  three  consecutive  blocks  of 
Consolidation  therapy  (high  risk  consolidation  blocks  HR1,  HR2,  and  HR3),  for  a  total  of  20  days  of 
chemotherapy  per  treatment  block.  After  consolidation  therapy,  patients  who  received  HSCT  did  not 
continue  with  imatinib  therapy  regardless  of  group.  After  consolidation  therapy,  patients  who  did  not 
undergo  HSCT  and  who  were  considered  suitable  to  receive  further  chemotherapy  continued  with 
‘Protocol II’ which consisted of two reinduction phases (Phase IIA and Phase IIB). Phase IIA started 14 
days  after  completion  of  consolidation  therapy,  and  Phase  IIB  started  36  days  after  completion  of 
consolidation  therapy.  After  reinduction  therapy,  patients  received  maintenance  antimetabolite-based 
low  intensity  chemotherapy  and  cranial  irradiation  therapy.  After  cranial  irradiation,  the  reinduction 
phases  (Phase  IIA  and  Phase  IIB)  were  repeated.  Continuation  therapy  started  2  weeks  after 
completion of delayed intensification (Protocol II), after which the maximum duration of chemotherapy 
was  24  months.  Figure  12  and  Figure  13  present  the  overall  study  design  and  treatment  blocks  for 
Good and Poor risk groups, respectively.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  justification  for  a  non-randomised  study  design  in  the  VHR  ALL  subpopulation  investigated  was 
based on the following characteristics of the patient population: 1) overall poor prognosis (5-year EFS 
<  45%);  2)  lack  of  a  generally  accepted  standard  of  care;  3)  limited  population  of  patients  for 
enrollment within an acceptable timeframe; and 4)  presence of historical control data for comparison 
of efficacy and safety.  
The  main  doubt  would  not  be  the  regimen  administered  but  if  the  addition  of  imatinib  to  other 
chemotherapy  regimens  could  provide  similar  outcomes.  There  are  several  paediatric  chemotherapy 
regimens  used  for  Ph+  ALL;  the  one  used  by  COG  in  Study  STI571I2301  is  considered  a  standard 
regimen as included in NCCN guidelines. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint of the main study has been clearly positive, EFS for cohort 5 (69.6%) was more 
than  twice  historical  controls  (31.6%).  Estimated  OS  rate  at  48  months  was  83.6%  in  cohort  5 
compared to 44.8% in the historical control group. In addition, several sensitivity analyses and subset 
of patients have supported the main results, which highlights the robustness of the outcomes.  
Risk  factors  (age,  cytogenetics,  immunophenotype,  and  response  to  induction  therapy)  were  not 
evenly distributed among the study cohorts and this might have contributed to an unknown extent on 
the most favourable results seen in cohort 5.  
The historical controls used in this study allow to compare and put into perspective the results of this 
trial.  
The  control  group  consisted  in  a  data  set  of  patients  from  several  protocols  for  B-precursor  ALL 
between  January  1986  and  November  1999.  The  introduction  of  imatinib  in  combination  with  high 
intensive backbone chemotherapy has given an impressive result in terms of EFS and OS at 48 months. 
This  result  appears  to  be  independent  of  HSCT  role  in  the  study,  since  the  results  in  the  population 
excluding HSCT patients were similar to the whole population (HSCT vs Chemo+Glivec alone).

The results appear better than other treatments (excluding HSCT) assessed so far in Ph+ ALL children.  
There are uncertainties on the impact of Glivec on transplantation and there is a need to generate 
additional data by a non-randomised single arm clinical trial or alternatively a registry. This 
requirement has been addressed by the MAH proposing a registry collecting data on interventions and 
outcomes in paediatric Ph+ALL patients treated with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT. The CHMP 
reviewed the concept sheet submitted by the MAH and requested input from the PDCO (see appendix 
01).  
The CHMP finally agreed to the concept sheet of a European observational registry collecting efficacy 
and safety data in newly diagnosed paediatric Ph+ ALL patients treated with chemotherapy + imatinib 
± HSCT (as reflected in the RMP). Approximately 100 male or female paediatric patients with a 
documented diagnosis of newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL (within 6 months of diagnosis) treated or on 
treatment with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT, would be recruited in this registry. For each patient 
enrolled in the registry, information will be collected according to the standard practice of the site with 
a minimum of once yearly update. Long term safety and efficacy data will be collected such that the 
follow-up for efficacy and safety will be at least 5 years.  
2.4.3.  Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
In  comparison  to  historical  controls,  the  introduction  of  imatinib  in  combination  with  high  intensive 
backbone chemotherapy showed clinically meaningful results in terms of EFS and OS at 48 months.  
In order to address the uncertainties related to the impact of Glivec on HSCT, the CHMP considers the 
following measure necessary: 
To conduct an observational registry collecting efficacy and safety data in newly diagnosed paediatric 
Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) patients treated with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT. 
Due date for submission of final results: 31/12/2020. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Studies STI571I2301 and STI571AIT07 provide data in support of the assessment of safety in Ph+ ALL 
paediatric  patients.  Both  studies  were  conducted  in  full  compliance  with  Good  Clinical  Practice  and 
were closely monitored by the cooperative groups, COG and EsPhALL, respectively. 
The  two  studies  (STI571I2301  and  STI571AIT07)  present  substantial  differences  in  terms  of  study 
design,  dose  and  duration  of  imatinib,  as  well  as  differences  in  chemotherapy  treatment.  Therefore, 
the data from the two studies are presented separately. In both studies, the safety set was defined as 
the set of patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The safety population comprised 93 
Ph+  patients  (92  analysed  by  Novartis)  in  Study  [STI571I2301]  and  159  Ph+  patients  (128  imatinib 
and 31 no imatinib) in Study [STI571AIT07]. All analyses of study STI571AIT07 were performed by the 
EsPhALL trial data centre in Italy. No data from this study was transferred to Novartis. Therefore, the 
exposure data could not be pooled with the STI571I 2301 study.  
Patient exposure 
Study STI571I2301 
For Ph+ ALL patients, duration of imatinib exposure was calculated as the sum of the time from start 
to end of imatinib treatment per block. Imatinib-free treatment blocks were not included. 
Of  the  92  Ph+  ALL  patients  included  in  the  study,  34  underwent  HSCT,  21  patients  on  study  and  13 
following withdrawal from the study.  The exposure in patients who did not undergo HSCT is described 
in table 20. 
Assessment report  
EMA/378913/2013  
Page 41/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 20: 
Among the Ph+ ALL patients receiving per protocol HSCT the overall median imatinib exposure prior to 
HSCT  was  42  days  (range,  21  to  77  days)  and  the  median  exposure  to  imatinib  following  HSCT  was 
169 days (range, 14 to 192 days). Among the Ph+ patients the overall median imatinib exposure prior 
to patients receiving off protocol HSCT was 53 days (range, 28 to 165 days)  
Study  STI571I2301  permitted  the  imatinib  dose  to  be  reduced  from  340  mg/m2/day  to  230 
mg/m2/day  for  patients  who  could  not  tolerate  the  higher  dose.  However,  imatinib  dose  and  dose 
modifications were not systematically entered in the dose administration record and therefore are not 
presented.  Only  overall  treatment  of  imatinib,  including  start  and  stop  dates,  were  captured  in  the 
CRF. Longer imatinib treatment did not correspond to higher number of patients with dose delays, as 
illustrated by the fact that the highest percentage of patients with dose delays were in cohorts 3 and 4, 
instead of in cohort 5.

Table 22: 
The  protocol  permitted  modification  of  dose  and  dose-delay  for  the  management  of  toxicity. 
Unexpected non-haematological grade 3- 4 toxicities, grade 3-4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia with 
clinically  significant  bleeding  or  infection  required  that  treatment  be  withheld  for  a  period  of  time. 
Following  a  dose-interruption,  treatment  with  imatinib  was  restarted  at  a  reduced  dose  (240  mg/m2 
daily) once the event resolved to grade 2 or lower.  
Table 23: 
Adverse events 
Study STI571I2301 
The following were identified by COG as “targeted toxicities:”  
•  Coagulation [partial thromboplastin time (PTT)]  
Assessment report  
EMA/378913/2013  
Page 43/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Coagulation [prothrombin time (PT)]  
•  Haemorrhage [Haemorrhage/ bleeding with Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia]  
•  Haemorrhage [Haemorrhage/ bleeding without Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia]  
•  Haemorrhage [CNS haemorrhage/ bleeding]  
•  Hepatic [aspartate aminotransferase/ glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/ SGOT)]  
•  Hepatic [SGPT (ALT)]  
•  Blood Bilirubin  
It was required that non-targeted AEs be reported by the investigators if they were grade 3 or higher 
and  recorded  in  the  COG  database.  However,  in  practice,  there  were  cases  of  AEs  less  than  grade  3 
that  were  reported.  AEs  that  met  the  criteria  for  expedited  reporting  were  expedited  via  the  AdEERs 
reporting guidelines.  
The incidence of non-targeted AEs of at least grade 3 by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term 
in  Ph+  patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  +  imatinib  as  well  as  Ph-  patients  who  received 
chemotherapy alone is summarised in Table 24.

Most patients experienced at least one AE during the study. The AEs reported were consistent with the 
established  safety  profile  of  imatinib.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  across  the  treatment  arms 
were  decreased  WBC  count,  haemoglobin,  platelet  count,  and  granulocyte  count  as  well  as  infections 
(Table 29).

Deaths 
Study STI571I2301 
Four deaths occurred on therapy or within 30 days of the last day of treatment. Of these, two patients 
received chemotherapy + imatinib. For both patients, Grade 5 AEs were reported and infection was the 
major  cause  of  death,  as  determined  by  the  investigator.  Both  infection  events  were  reported  as 
suspected  to  be  related  to  study  medication  by  investigator.  However,  neither  of  these  deaths  was 
reported as suspected to be related to study medication (neither imatinib nor chemotherapy). 
The other 2 patient deaths on therapy were in the Ph- control group and did not receive imatinib.

Table 30: 
As  expected  for  the  nature  of  the  underlying  disease,  the  most  common  primary  cause  of  death  was 
malignant disease progression, followed by infection and multi-organ failure. The proportion of patients 
who died due to malignant disease progression was 3 times higher in Ph- patients (27.7%) receiving 
chemotherapy alone compared to Ph+ ALL patients (8.7%) receiving chemotherapy + imatinib (Table 
31).

Table 35: 
Laboratory findings 
In  both  studies,  laboratory  reference  values  were  not  entered  during  the  study  in  the  CRF  on  a 
continuous scale and no normal ranges were available from these studies. 
In addition, ANC and platelet decrease below a minimum threshold level (<750/μL for ANC counts and 
<75000/μL for platelet counts) were marked in the CRF and the date of recovery was noted. 
Other  laboratory  evaluations  such  as  ALT,  AST,  bilirubin  increased,  PTT  prolonged,  haemorrhage,  PT 
prolonged, were captured as pre-specified targeted toxicities. 
Laboratory data were not available from the Ph- ALL population. 
In study [STI571AIT07], laboratory abnormalities for pre-specified assessments were collected on the 
CRF  toxicity  form  according  to  investigator  assignment  using  NCI-CTC  grade  (version  2,  adopted  for 
the  use  of  paediatric  oncology  patients).  Information  was  collected  on  the  following  laboratory 
parameters: haematological, renal, and pancreatic/liver and coagulation toxicities. 
Haematology Results-Study STI571I2301 
As  expected  for  the  treatment  regimen,  most  Ph+  ALL  patients  had  a  drop  in  ANC  <750/μL  at  some 
time,  regardless  of  imatinib  administration.  The  percentages  of  patients  with  a  decrease  in  ANC 
<750/μL  in  Consolidation  1  were  85.7%  (cohort  1),  58.3%  (cohort  2),  54.5%  (cohort  3),  72.7% 
(cohort  4)  and  82.0%  (cohort  5).  Most  patients  recovered  from  this  degree  of  neutropenia  with  the 
exception of one patient in cohort 1 and one patient in cohort 5. The median time to recovery (ANC ≥ 
750/μL)  in  Consolidation  1  ranged  from  5  to  8  days  for  all  cohorts.  Across  all  treatment  blocks,  the 
time to recovery was similar in cohort 5 compared to all cohorts combined, ranging from 3 days to 35 
Assessment report

days.  In  general,  during  earlier  treatment  courses  recovery  occurred  within  7  days  and  in  later 
courses, in particular during Maintenance courses, the time to recovery to ≥ 750/μL was 8 to 14 days 
or longer. 
There is no apparent difference in the incidence of ANC <750/μL nor in the time to recovery related to 
the incorporation of imatinib into each treatment course. 
The  number  of  patients  with  platelets  <75000/μL  at  anytime  varied  in  all  cohorts  by  treatment  lock, 
being highest in Consolidation 2 and Intensifications 1 and 2 and lowest in Maintenance 5 to 12. The 
overall median time to recovery ranged from 5.5 to 17 days, and was similar in cohort 5 (5.5 days to 
20.5 days). 
In general, there was no difference between treatment blocks, with the exception of a longer time to 
recovery  to  >75000/μL  in  Reinduction  2  for  patients  treated  with  imatinib  and  a  longer  time  to 
recovery for patients not treated with imatinib in Intensification 2. 
Haematology Results–Study STI571AIT07 
With respect to haematology, decreased white blood count, haemoglobin and platelet count was 
observed in over 90% of the patients in both groups without and with imatinib. There were no 
significant differences observed across the treatment groups 
Safety in special populations 
Study STI571I2301 included 15 patients aged <4 years including 3 patients aged 1 to 2 years old. To 
better  assess  the  safety  profile  in  the  younger  paediatric  population,  a  safety  analysis  of  <4  vs.  ≥  4 
years old was considered appropriate. 
Deaths, AdEERs, and other significant AEs are summarised by age group in Table 34. 
Table 36: 
The  most  frequent  AEs  in  all  age  groups  were  related  to  investigations  (laboratory  abnormalities). 
Patients who had HSCT also reported frequently with surgical and medical procedures regardless of the 
age and with infections and infestations (age <12 years) and gastrointestinal disorders (age 12 to <18 
years). 
The number of patients ≥ 18 years of age was too low to present meaningful results. In patients < 12 
years  of  age  in  cohort  5,  the  most  frequent  AEs  were  haematological  (decreased  neutrophil  count, 
decreased  platelet  count,  decreased  haemoglobin,  WBC  decreased,  packed  red  blood  cell  (RBC) 
transfusion)  or  related  to  investigations  (ALT  increased,  hypokalaemia)  and  infections  (neutropenic 
infection, febrile neutropenia). 
No  clinically  relevant  differences  were  observed  concerning  the  frequencies  of  AEs  in  different  age 
groups; however, the number of patients included in the respective age groups was relatively low. The 
AEs reported were consistent with the known safety profile of imatinib.

In Study STI571AIT07 the incidence of AEs was similar in the <4 years and ≥ 4 years age groups. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information has been generated in support of this indication. Results of drug-drug interaction 
studies have been detailed in prior applications and are described in the approved prescribing 
information. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study STI571I2301 
Overall  the  percentage  of  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  was  low  when  imatinib  was  added  to  the 
chemotherapy regimen. Four patients (4.3%) in the Ph+ group (two patients in cohorts 3 plus 4 and 2 
patients in cohort 5) and one patient in the Ph- group were discontinued prematurely from the study 
due to toxicity. 
•  One patient in cohort 3 discontinued study treatment due to pancreatitis (causality assessed as 
due to PEG L-Asparaginase). 
•  One patients in cohort 4 discontinued study treatment due to hepatic toxicity (ALT increased, 
AST increased) following per protocol HSCT. At the time of the grade 3 transaminase elevation 
this  patient  was  receiving  the  study  medication  (imatinib)  during  the  HSCT  followup  phase. 
Imatinib  was  permanently  discontinued  due  to  hepatic  toxicity  approximately  2  weeks  after 
having  restarted  following  HSCT  therapy.  The  patient  was  taken  off  all  protocol  therapy 
approximately  3  months  after  imatinib  was  permanently  discontinued.  The  investigator 
suspected a possible relationship between the event (alanine aminotransferase increased) and 
the  study  medication  (imatinib).  The  investigator  suspected  an  unlikely  relationship  between 
the  events  (liver  disorder,  gamma  glutamyltransferase  increased,  aspartate  aminotransferase 
increased, and dyspnea) and the study medication (imatinib). 
•  One  patient  in  cohort  5,  who  had  previously  experienced  severe  conjunctivitis  due  to 
cytarabine, discontinued the study treatment due to palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia, a skin 
disorder consisting of blisters on the right shin and left foot that occurred after HSCT. 
•  One  patient  in  cohort  5  experienced  life  threatening  constitutional  symptoms  (general 
symptom) and was noted with (cerebral) ventriculomegaly and transependymal edema on MRI 
suggesting hydrocephalus and was assessed as unlikely due to imatinib by the investigator.

Table 37: 
Study STI571AIT07 
Of  the  128  patients  treated  with  imatinib,  only  one  patient  discontinued  the  study  due  to  toxicity. 
Toxicity was assessed by the investigator as probably related to asparaginase, and not causally related 
to imatinib. 
Table 38: 
Post marketing experience 
A  worldwide  literature  search  was  performed  to  capture  any  investigator  reports  on  safety  aspects 
which are not included in the study reports (Ovid date of search: 1948 to Nov 2011; Embase date of 
search:  1996  to  22  Dec  2011).  The  results  of  this  literature  search  did  not  provide  any  evidence  of 
unexpected or unknown events that would be attributable to treatment with imatinib, thus supporting 
the established safety and tolerability profile of imatinib. 
The post-marketing safety of imatinib is monitored on an ongoing basis. In the post-marketing setting, 
with approximately 776114 patient-years of post-marketing exposure, no safety concerns have 
emerged that were not previously known for imatinib with the submission of these paediatric Ph+ ALL 
Assessment report

studies. The safety profile of imatinib remains consistent with the information provided in the Core 
Data Sheet. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database comprised 93 Ph+ subjects from the pivotal study STI571I2301 and 159 Ph+ 
patients (128 imatinib) from the supportive study STI571AIT07. Of them, 58 children from the main 
trial (subset excluding HSCT patients) were treated with high intensive chemotherapy + imatinib, 
being 30 patients the target population since this is the subjects in the cohort 5.  
The exposure to imatinib in the cohort 5 has been more than 2 years, though the optimal duration with 
imatinib treatment is unclear.  
The percentage of patients with AEs was higher in the group treated with imatinib than in the 
chemotherapy as only treatment. This seems logical and expectable. As relevant AEs in a higher 
percent observed in the cohort 5, neutrophil and platelet count, haemoglobin, neutropenic infection, 
pharyngitis, vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, electrolytes, hypertension and hypoxia, are 
the more notorious, whereas myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity were the most remarkable safety 
concerns in the subgroup of targeted toxicities.  On the whole, the safety profile of the combination of 
high intensive chemotherapy + imatinib, does not seem to add any safety concern on the widely 
known safety profile of imatinib. 
Regarding the deaths and SAEs, more patients died in the Ph- group (group treated with 
chemotherapy only) than in the imatinib arm (24% vs 44.5%, respectively), which is reassuring. This 
result has been supported by the STI571AIT07 study, in where the highest percentage of deaths was 
found in the no imatinib arm. Nevertheless, speaking about SAEs, the cohort 5 has 50 % of SAEs 
(excluding the subset of patients with BMT), which is by far, the highest percent of SAEs among 
cohorts. A direct comparison with Ph- subset is lacking. 
In the laboratory findings the results highlight the AEs described above: neutropenia, platelet changes 
and liver enzymes. 
Finally, the discontinuation and the post marketing experience do not lead to any safety concerns. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the sample size of the safety database is limited and data on the long-term use of imatinib in 
this new population are lacking. The safety findings from these two studies are pointing out that 
adding imatinib increases the toxicity of the backbone chemotherapy; there were more AEs and SAEs 
though less deaths. 
No new safety concerns for imatinib have been identified. 
In order to address the limitations related to the limited size of the safety database, the CHMP 
considers the following measure necessary: 
To conduct an observational registry collecting efficacy and safety data in newly diagnosed paediatric 
Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) patients treated with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT.

2.7.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, sections 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated in order to include information with 
regard to the environmental risk. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template, which were 
reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. Furthermore, minor editorial changes have been introduced. 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable.

2.8.  Significance of paediatric studies  
The CHMP is of the opinion that studies 1 (COG AALL0031) and 2 (EsPhALL), which are contained in 
the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan, which is completed, and have been initiated before 26 
January 2007 and completed after 26 January 2007, are considered as significant. Study 1 was a well-
founded dose-finding cohort study that is significant because it is considered as the pivotal efficacy 
study for the paediatric use assessed in this procedure. Study 2 was initially conducted as a 
comparative efficacy study, continuing as a prospective safety study, and the study is significant 
because it informs the safe use of the medicinal product in the paediatric population, in conjunction 
with multi-agent chemotherapy. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Four-year EFS in cohort 5 was 69.6%, more than twice that of historical controls with 31.6% (HR=0.28 
CI 95% 0.16-0.49). The beneficial effects of imatinib were also reflected in the OS results (estimated 
OS  rate  at  48  months  was  83.6%  in  cohort  5  compared  to  44.8%  in  the  historical  control  group; 
HR=0.23). 
Analyses comparing EFS and OS for cohort 1+2 vs cohort 5 showed better results for cohort 5 for both 
endpoints (p=0.0101 and p=0.0091, respectively). For the comparison of cohort 3+4 vs cohort 5, 
there was a trend in favour of cohort 5 with longer EFS and OS in the continuous dose cohort. An 
update after 5 years shows a clear benefit for imatinib. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
HSCT is still recommended in the eradication of Ph+ ALL and patients in Complete Remission are firm 
candidates, if possible, to receive a HSCT. There is uncertainty in Ph+ ALL paediatric patients whether 
the addition of imatinib to a standard regimen has any effect on the efficacy and/or safety of 
subsequent HSCT. In order to address this uncertainty, the MAH will conduct an observational registry 
collecting efficacy and safety data in newly diagnosed paediatric Ph+ ALL patients treated with 
chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  percentage  of  patients  with  AEs  was  higher  in  the  group  treated  with  imatinib  than  in  the 
chemotherapy  as  only  treatment.  This  seems  logical  and  expectable.  As  relevant  AEs  in  a  higher 
percent  observed  in  the  cohort  5,  neutrophil  and  platelet  count,  haemoglobin,  neutropenic  infection, 
pharyngitis, vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, electrolytes, hypertension and hypoxia, are 
the  more  relevant,  whereas  myelosuppression  and  hepatotoxicity  were  the  most  remarkable  safety 
concerns in the subgroup of targeted toxicities. 
Regarding  the  deaths  and  SAEs,  more  patients  died  in  the  Ph-  group  (group  treated  with 
chemotherapy only) than in the imatinib arm (24% vs 44.5%, respectively), which is reassuring. This 
result has been supported by the STI571AIT07 study, in where the highest percentage of deaths was 
found  in  the  no  imatinib  arm.  Nevertheless,  speaking  about  SAEs,  the  cohort  5  has  50  %  of  SAEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/378913/2013  
Page 64/67 
 
 
 
 
 
(excluding  the  subset  of  patients  with  BMT),  which  is  by  far,  the  highest  percent  of  SAEs  among 
cohorts. 
In the laboratory findings the results highlight the AEs above described, neutropenia, platelet changes 
and liver enzymes. 
Finally, the discontinuation and the post marketing experience do not lead to any safety concerns. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  in  children  seems  to  be  comparable  to  adults,  though  the  limited  sample  size 
preclude  drawing  firm  conclusions.  In  spite  of  this  uncertainty,  the  profile of  AEs  and  their  frequency 
are reassuringly similar to adults, without any new safety concern. 
The  high  percentage  of  SAEs  in  cohort  5,  which  is  the  main  set  of  data  supporting  this  application, 
raises concerns in relation to the addition of Glivec to chemotherapy regimen. However, the benefit for 
the patients in terms of EFS and OS clearly outweighs the risks. 
Finally, the long term exposure to Glivec might be partially covered by data from others paediatric 
indications.  
In order to address the limitations related to the limited size of the safety database, the MAH will 
conduct an observational registry collecting efficacy and safety data in newly diagnosed paediatric Ph+ 
ALL patients treated with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The outcomes in terms of EFS and OS from the COG study are pointing out a promising result in this 
high  risk  population.  These  results  appear  to  be  difficult  to  obtain  with  the  currently  used 
chemotherapy  regimen.  Certainly,  the  relevance  of the  results  is  high  and  as  a  consequence,  several 
guidelines  around  the  world  already  include  the  use  of  Glivec  in  the  treatment  of  Ph+  ALL  paediatric 
patients.  
The safety findings from the two studies supporting this application point out an increased toxicity of 
the backbone chemotherapy.   
Benefit-risk balance 
The introduction of imatinib in combination with high intensive backbone chemotherapy gives clinically 
meaningful  results  in  terms  of  EFS  and  OS  at  48  months.  These  results  appear  to  be  independent  of 
HSCT  role  in  the  study,  since  the  outcome  in  the  population  excluding  HSCT  patients  were  pretty 
similar to the whole population (HSCT vs Chemo+Glivec alone). The benefits showed by Glivec in the 
treatment of Ph+ ALL in children, outweigh the toxicity associated with chemotherapy+imatinib. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
In  summary,  relevant  results  have  been  shown  when  adding  imatinib  to  standard  chemotherapy 
regimen in the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive 
acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (Ph+  ALL).  From  a  safety  point  of  view  there  are  no  major  concerns 
given that imatinib is a well-known medicinal product, also used in children in other indications.

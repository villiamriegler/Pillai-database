The MAH submitted a review of the data from the clinical 
(SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL). Changes to include 
adverse drug reaction "nasal dryness" in SmPC 
Section 4.8 and to include a warning on the risk of 
oedema of the tongue or laropharynx, or difficulty 
breathing in SmPC Section 4.4. The PL has been 
amended accordingly. Additionally, editorial and QRD 
template related changes are implemented in the 
SmPC and the PL, and contact details of the local 
representatives in Poland, Romania and Cyprus are 
updated in the PL. 
trials and post-marketing reports for darifenacin in relation 
to nasal dryness and angioedema. Nasal dryness have been 
reported more frequently in association with use of 
darifenacin as compared to one antimuscarinic active 
control or placebo in clinical trials, and following post-
marketing reports, therefore nasal dryness was included in 
the PI as an adverse reaction. The accumulated reports of 
angioedema were also analysed. Based on these findings, a 
warning has been was added to section 4.4 of the SmPC to 
stop the treatment with darifenacin in case oedema of the 
tongue or laropharynx, or difficulty breathing develops.

Based on the review of the available information the CHMP 
II, Labelling 
is of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy 
and PL 
of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considers that the 
benefit/risk profile of Emselex continues to be favorable.  
The CHMP was of the opinion that the renewal could be 
granted with unlimited validity. 
However the MAH will continue to submit yearly PSURs, 
unless otherwise specified by the CHMP. 
The MAH also provided a new reworded text for the section 
4.6 Fertility, Pregancy and lactation and 5.3 Pre-clinical 
safety data of the SPC according to the new guideline on 
reproductive toxicity data and labeling. Fertility data have 
been included; the information on the use in pregnancy has

following sections have been updated: 
Section 4.5.  Interaction with other medicinal products and 
other forms of interaction 
For clarity and consistency, the darifenacin exposure in the 
presence of paroxetine has been updated to better reflect 
the results of a randomised placebo controlled, parallel 
group study to investigate the effects of paroxetine on the 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and 
tolerability of darifenacin at steady state (protocol 
A1371008), submitted as part of the original application. In 
addition, ritonavir is also listed as one potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor. 
Section 4.7. Effects on ability to drive and use machines

experiencing effects such as dizziness, blurred vision, 
insomnia and somnolence should not drive or use

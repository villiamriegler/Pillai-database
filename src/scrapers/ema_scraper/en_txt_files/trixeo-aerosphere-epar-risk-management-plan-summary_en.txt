PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR 
TRIXEO AEROSPHERE (FORMOTEROL, GLYCOPYRRONIUM AND 
BUDESONIDE) 
This is a summary of the EU RMP for TRIXEO AEROSPHERE. The EU RMP details 
important risks of TRIXEO AEROSPHERE, how these risks can be minimised, and how more 
information will be obtained about TRIXEO AEROSPHERE’s risks and uncertainties 
(missing information). 
TRIXEO AEROSPHERE’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package 
leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how TRIXEO 
AEROSPHERE should be used. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
TRIXEO AEROSPHERE is intended for a maintenance treatment for adult patients with 
moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (see SmPC for the full 
indication).  It contains budesonide, glycopyrronium bromide, and formoterol fumarate 
dehydrate as the active substances and it is given by pressurised inhalation suspension.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS 
In compliance with present EMA RMP guidelines, there are no important identified risks, 
important potential risks or missing information included in the TRIXEO AEROSPHERE EU 
RMP.  
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and local label addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
AstraZeneca does not plan to perform any risk minimisation activities in relation to the use of 
TRIXEO AEROSPHERE other than routine minimisation measures.  
 
 
 
Information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularly analysed, 
including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate action can be 
taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
AstraZeneca does not plan to perform any pharmacovigilance activities outside of routine 
activities and measures in relation to TRIXEO AEROSPHERE nor has AstraZeneca received 
any request to perform any such activity. 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or 
minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of TRIXEO AEROSPHERE.  Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine). 
There are no important risks or missing information for TRIXEO AEROSPHERE.

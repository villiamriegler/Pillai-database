Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/154/2011 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/154/2011 eligible for the reward. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Invega  (paliperidone)  is  a  monoaminergic  antagonist  with  a  high  affinity  for  serotoninergic  (5-
hydroxytryptamine  Type  2A)  and  dopaminergic  Type  2  receptors.    It  belongs  to  the  atypical, 
antipsychotic  class  of  psychotropic  drugs.  It  is  the  major  active  metabolite  of  risperidone  which  is 
authorised for the treatment of schizophrenia. Paliperidone have been developed as an oral prolonged-
release  formulation  (paliperidone  ER  or  PR  tablets)  and  a  long-acting  IM  injectable  formulation 
(paliperidone  palmitate).  Paliperidone  palmitate  (Xeplion)  is  subject  to  a  separate  marketing 
authorisation (MA). 
Invega  tablets  (1.5,  3,  6,  9,  and  12  mg)  are  currently  approved  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  for  the 
treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (psychotic or manic symptoms) in adults with 
recommended dose of 6 mg once daily. Dosage adjustment may be required within the recommended 
range  of  3-12  mg  once  daily  in  patients  with  schizophrenia  and  6-12  mg  once  daily  in  patients  with 
schizoaffective disorder. 
In  December  2009,  the  MAH  submitted  one  completed  paediatric  study,  R076477-PSZ-3001,  for 
Invega (paliperidone) in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended  (EMEA/H/C/746/P46/011).  No  further  actions  were  required  by  the  CHMP  awaiting  for  the 
completion  of  the  phase  III  study  R076477-PSZ-3003  to  consider  an  update  of  the  Product 
Information (PI). The procedure was concluded in March 2010. 
In December 2010, the MAH submitted two other completed paediatric studies,  R076477-PSZ-3002 
and  R076477-PSZ-3003,  for  Invega  (paliperidone)  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  the  Paediatric 
Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended  (EMEA/H/C/746/P46/017).  The  CHMP  agreed  in  February 
2013 to assess these data within the planned submission for an extension of indication in March 2013. 
Subsequently, 
the  MAH 
submitted 
the 
present 
application.  Within 
this 
procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/746/II/37),  the  MAH  initially  applied  for  an  extension  of  indication  of  Invega  (new 
indication is underlined) as follows: 
“INVEGA is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and  in  adolescents  12 years  and 
older.” 
For  the  extension  of  indication  applied  for,  the  MAH  initially  proposed  the  following  posology  for 
Invega: 
“The recommended starting dose is 3 mg once daily, administered in the morning. Some patients may 
benefit from a higher dose of 6 mg to 12 mg once daily. Dosage adjustment, if indicated, should occur 
only after clinical reassessment based on the individual need of the patient. When dose increases are 
indicated, increments of 3 mg/day are recommended and generally should occur at intervals of 5 days 
or more.” 
This  application  is  based  on  the  previously  mentioned  clinical  studies  (R076477-PSZ-3001, 
R076477-PSZ-3002 and R076477-PSZ-3003) which are part of the agreed Paediatric Investigation 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 6/87 
 
 
 
 
Plan  (PIP)  for  paliperidone  ER.  An  open-label  single  and  multiple  dose  Phase  1  study  (PALIOROS-
PSZ-1001) was also conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) properties of paliperidone ER 
and  its  safety  profile  in  paediatric  subjects  (aged  10  to  17  years)  and  is  also  referred  in  this 
application.  This  study  was  previously  submitted  in  accordance  with  article  45  of  the  Paediatric 
Regulation (FUM 10). Additionally, 2 non-clinical studies (TOX8691, TOX8145) were submitted in this 
application, TOX8691 being part of the PIP. 
During  the  evaluation,  the  MAH  proposed  to  restrict  the  proposed  indication  to  treatment  of 
schizophrenia  in  adolescents  15  years  and  older.  The  posology  was  also  revised  and  is  further 
discussed below. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
The MAH provided one toxicity study with repeated oral administration of paliperidone for seven weeks 
in juvenile rats. Furthermore, another toxicity study with oral treatment of risperidone for 40 weeks in 
juvenile dogs was submitted. Both juvenile toxicities studies were conducted in compliance with Good 
Laboratory Practices (GLP). 
2.2.1.  Toxicology 
These data are summarised in Table 1. Tables 2 and 3 present the toxicokinetic results.

juvenile dogs. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No  new  ERA  data  were  initially  submitted  by  the  MAH.  However,  considering  this  application  is  to 
extend  the  use  in  the  paediatric  population  with  schizophrenia,  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to 
provide  an  updated  medical  statistical  data  for  the  new  estimated  market  penetration  and  the 
calculation of the refined Predicted Environmental Concentration in the surface water (PECsw) in Phase 
II tier A. Using an estimated consumption of active substance in geographic region per year (CON ai) of 
289 kg (the highest predicted usage of paliperidone from 2013-2019), the Fpen was found lower than 
previous  calculation  based  on  a  predicted  CONai  of  775  kg  for  2014.  Consequently  the  PEC  of 
paliperidone in surface water was 0.0001 µg/L (compared with 0.003 µg/L calculated in previous ERA). 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that no further ERA data were required with the proposed extension of 
indication  and  agreed  that  adding  a  patient  population  of  12-17  year  old  would  not  significantly  alter 
the  exposure  of  paliperidone  to  the  environment,  also  taking  into  account  that  schizophrenia  only 
exists  very  rarely  in  children  and  adolescents  (estimated  1  in  10,000)  compared  with  a  lifetime 
prevalence of 0.5 to 1 in 100 in adults. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In  juvenile  rats,  dosing  by  oral  gavage  at  0.16,  0.63  and  2.5  mg/kg/day,  no  new  findings  were 
observed,  compared  to  what  is  already  known  for paliperidone.  The  findings  observed  were  expected 
pharmacological  effects.  A  possibly  treatment-related  effect  on  learning  and  memory  was  seen  in 
females  only  and  the  CHMP  considered  necessary  to  include  this  effect  in  the  SmPC  of  paliperidone, 
although  the  clinical  significance  of  this  finding  was  unclear.  Whilst  learning  and  memory  was  not 
compromised in males in this study, the CHMP noted that slight effects on learning and memory were 
previously evident in juvenile rats of both genders administered with 1.25 mg/kg risperidone. Based on 
these  results,  the  No  Observed  Adverse  Effect  Level  (NOAEL)  for  males  and  females  was  2.5 
mg/kg/day and 0.63 mg/kg/day, respectively.  
In  juvenile  dogs,  dosed  by  oral  gavage  at  0.31,  1.25  or  5  mg/kg  risperidone  /day,  no  new  findings 
were  observed,  compared  to  what  is  already  known  for  risperidone/paliperidone.    Testosterone  and 
progesterone  levels  together  with  histopathological  findings  in  the  prostate,  mammary  gland,  ovaries

and uterus indicated that sexual maturity was delayed in dogs at all dose levels. A trend to reversibility 
was  seen  during  the  recovery  period  for  males  and  the  low  and  mid  dose  females,  whereas  recovery 
was not seen in females administered 5 mg/kg/day.  
In  dogs,  overall  femur  growth  was  reduced  during  treatment  for  females  at  5  mg/kg/day  and  the 
overall change in shoulder height was also less for males and females at this dose level. Furthermore, 
at 40 weeks, the femurs of females at 5 mg/kg/day had lower mineral density for the proximal femur 
and  the  femoral  diaphysis.  These  findings  on  bone  development  are  expected  effects  of  atypical 
antipsychotics such as paliperidone and likely due to increased levels of prolactin.   
All  the  effects  seen  in  dog  were  reversible  during  the  recovery  period.  Based  on  these  results  the 
NOAEL for males and females was 0.31 mg/kg/day.  
In  previous  studies  conducted  in  adult  animals,  effects  were  seen  at  or  below  clinical  exposure.  In 
adolescents,  the  C max  was  23.2  (9.62-89.3)  ng/mL  and  the  AUC 0-24  was  486  (215-1750)  ng*h/mL. 
Comparing  the  clinical  exposure  with  the  exposures  reached  in  the  rat  study,  no  margin  to  human 
exposure was reached at NOAEL in female rats, whereas a margin of 3 was reached in males (NOAEL 
was the highest dose tested). In dogs, at NOAEL, the margin to clinical exposure was approximately 3. 
The  nervous  and  reproductive  systems  are  the  main  organ  systems  which  are  under  development 
between 12-18 years. The rats were 3.5 weeks at the beginning of the study and the study lasted for 7 
weeks,  thus  the  critical  maturation  period  regarding  nervous  and  reproductive  systems  in  the  rats  is 
considered  covered.  In  the  dog  study,  the  critical  period  for  skeletal  and  reproductive  system 
development was covered. 
Overall,  available  non-clinical  data  obtained  in  juvenile  rats  with  paliperidone  are  consistent  with 
previous  results  from  treatment  of  juvenile  rats  and  dogs  with  the  parent  compound  risperidone.  For 
this  reason,  these  data  are  regarded  sufficient  to  support  the  proposed  therapy  of  schizophrenia  in 
adolescents  of  12 years  and  older  initially  applied  for.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  effects  in 
juvenile  animals  already  occurred  at  exposures  (based  on  AUC),  which  are  either  close  (delay  of 
physical  development  and  sexual  maturation  in  risperidone-treated  dogs)  or  equal  (learning  and 
memory  deficits  in  rats  administered  either  paliperidone  or  risperidone)  to  the  level  achieved  at  the 
maximum  recommended  dose  in  adolescents.  The  CHMP  therefore  considered  necessary  to  include  a 
description of the findings from the juvenile toxicity studies in the SmPC. In addition, SmPC warnings 
related to hyperprolactinaemia- and sedation-related side effects were added in view of the non-clinical 
findings that were further supported by clinical data (see 2.5). 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  non-clinical  aspects  of  Invega  have  been  adequately  documented  and  meet  the 
requirements to support this application.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of paliperidone in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age inclusive) was 
investigated  in  study  PALIOROS-PSZ-1001  and  R076477-PSZ-3001.  The  data  were  analysed  both 
using  non-compartmental  analysis  and  population  pharmacokinetic  (popPK)  modeling  in  NONMEM.  In 
study PALIOROS-PSZ-1001, only one subject was below 12 years, hence the CHMP considered that the 
presented data characterised the PK in adolescents (12-17 years inclusive) and the term “adolescents” 
is used throughout the report as a reference to the studied population. 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of paliperidone ER in adolescents has not been investigated. 
Following  single-dose  administration,  peak  plasma  concentration  was  reached  after  approximately  24 
hours  (Figure  1).  Based  on  a  popPK  analysis  the  intra-individual  variability  in  relative  bioavailability 
(F1) is 46.4%.

Figure 1: Mean (±SD) Paliperidone Plasma Concentration-Time Profile (Dose-Normalized to 
6 mg/day) in Adolescents (Study PSZ-1001) 
Based  on  observed  data,  steady-state  plasma  exposure  (dose-normalized  to  6  mg/day)  was  on 
average 50% higher in adolescents compared to adults (see Table 5). 
Table  5:  Steady-State  Plasma  (Dose-Normalized  to  6  mg/day)  and  Urine  PK  Parameters  of 
Paliperidone in Pediatric (Adolescent) and Adult Subjects 
Distribution 
The  volume  of  distribution  in  adolescents  was  found  to  be  large;  Vss  (sum  of  central  and  peripheral 
volume  in  the  popPK  model)  is  approximately  440  L.  The  corresponding  figure  for  adults  is 
approximately 490 L. 
The  steady-state  AUC24h  (+)/(–)  enantiomer  ratio  and  fraction  unbound  (fu)  of  paliperidone  in 
adolescents  were  similar  to  values  obtained  in  adults.  The  enantiomer  ratio  was  approximately  1.4, 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 12/87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared  to  1.6  in  adults.  The  mean  fu  of  paliperidone  was  approximately  26%  in  both  adolescents 
and adults. 
Elimination 
In adolescents, the observed average CL/F in study PSZ-1001 was 12.5 L/h (209 mL/min). The fraction 
excreted, fe, was approximately 20%. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In  study  PSZ-1001,  steady-state  drug  concentrations  were  attained  within  4  to  5  days  of  dosing  as 
seen  in  Figure  1.  Plasma  exposure  (Cmax  and  AUC24h)  increased  with  increasing  dose.  The 
accumulation  ratio,  based  on  visual  inspection  of  the  peak  plasma  concentrations  following  single  vs. 
multiple  dosing,  was  approximately  3.7.  The  popPK  model  indicated  linear,  dose-proportional 
pharmacokinetics. 
Special populations 
The effect of renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied in adolescents. 
According to the MAH, given that maturation of renal function is completed by early childhood and the 
PK and plasma protein binding of paliperidone are similar in adolescents and adults, it is expected that 
the  impact  of  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  on  the  PK  of  paliperidone  in  adolescents  will  be  similar  to 
that  in  the  adult  population.  In  the  popPK  modeling  the  effects  of  body  weight,  age  and  creatinine 
clearance were investigated (see 2.3.3). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  in  adolescents.  This  was  considered 
acceptable  by  the  CHMP,  given  the  available  interaction  data  in  adults  (paroxetine,  trimethoprim, 
carbamazepine and divalproex sodium). 
2.3.3.   PK/PD Modelling 
PK modeling 
Exploratory popPK modeling was carried out using data from PSZ-1001 and PSZ-3001. An adult popPK 
model  developed  on  Phase  3  data  was  used  as  a  starting  point.  The  final  PK  model  was  further 
validated taking into account the observed data from study PSZ-3003. 
A  total  of  105  male  and  57  female  adolescent  subjects  were  included  in  the  PK  dataset  which  also 
included  adult  data  (110  male  and  43  female  subjects).  The  racial  composition  of  the  adolescent 
population was about 66.0% White, 10.5% Black (including African-American), 1.2% Hispanic-Latinos 
and  22.2%  Asian.  The  median  age  was  16.1  years  and  ranged  from  10.3  to  17.9  years.  Only  one 
subject in the dataset was < 12 years of age. The median BMI was 21 kg/m2 and ranged from 13.5 to 
35.1  kg/m2.  The  median  BW  was  58.1  kg  (range:  29.0  to  104.6  kg).  The  median  CrCLc  was  141 
mL/min and ranged from 29.8 to 231 mL/min. 
The distribution of continuous covariates for Adolescents is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Distribution of Continuous Covariates From the Adolescents in the popPK Dataset 
The  available  adult  PK  model  was  first  used  to  simulate  the  adolescent  data  under  the  observed 
covariate  values  and  design  but  with  fixed  model  parameters.  The  model  was  found  applicable  since 
the prediction error (precision) and absolute prediction error (bias) were within the defined criteria. 
The model was then executed on adolescent data  only but the run was terminated. Body weight was 
used as covariate on CL/F instead of lean body mass. To improve stability adult data was included and 
the  model  was  reduced  in  terms  of  random  effects  on  structural  parameters.  After  successful 
termination, the effect of age alone was tested n CL/F but was not found to be statistically significant. 
The  final  model  included  body  weight  (BW)  and  calculated  creatinine  clearance  (CLCr,  Schwartz 
formula) as covariates on CL/F according to the equation below: 
The  parameters  estimates  from  the  final  model,  relative  standard  error  (RSE%)  and  calculated 
shrinkage are shown in Table 6.

The  final  population  PK  model  was  used  to  simulate  the  exposure  in  the  adult  and  adolescent 
populations.  
Simulation of a once-daily dose of 6 mg in adults and in adolescents weighing at least 51 kg resulted in 
comparable plasma exposure to paliperidone. Similarly, paliperidone plasma exposure following once-
daily  dose  of  6  mg  in  adults  and  adolescents  weighing  <51 kg  was  comparable.  In  adolescents 
weighing <51 kg, a 23% higher mean average plasma concentration was observed than in adolescents 
weighing ≥51 kg.  Based on these results, no PK-based dose adjustments were proposed by the MAH 
in adolescents (12 to 17 years). See Figures 4 and 5.

Simulation  of  a  once-daily  dose  of  6  mg  in  adults  and  3  mg  in  adolescents  resulted  in  lower  plasma 
exposure  to  paliperidone  in  adolescents,  even  in  the  lower-weight  group,  indicating  that  the  lower 
clearance in adolescents < 51 kg is overcompensated by dividing dose in half. See Figures 6 and 7.

PKPD modeling 
Safety - Incidence of Extrapyramidal Symptoms 
Data  from  study  PSZ-3001  were  used  to  explore  the  PK/PD-relationship  between  the  risk  of  having 
EPS-related treatment emergent adverse events and paliperidone exposure. To assess the similarity of 
the  PK/PD-relationship  in  adolescents  and  adults,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  EPS-related  AEs  in 
the  PSZ-3001  study  was  simulated  using  the  model  that  was  previously  developed  for  adults.  The 
individual  predicted  average  steady  state  concentration  (Css)  was  calculated  using  empirical  Bayes 
estimates derived from the popPK model (previous section). 
There were  no EPS-related AEs observed in the placebo group. The incidence of EPS-related AEs was 
low in the exposure groups with a median Css < 20 ng/mL. The EPS incidence was higher in exposure 
groups with a median Css > 20 ng/mL . Overall, 41% of subjects had a Css > 20 ng/mL, but there was 
a major difference in the distribution of Css between treatment groups: 0% in the low dose group had 
a Css > 20 ng/mL, while 49% in the medium dose group and 77% in the high dose group had a Css > 
20 ng/mL. See Figure 8.

2.3.4.  Additional analyses 
During the evaluation, the MAH provided a revised popPK model using only the data in adolescents ie 
excluding  the  adult  data  and  the  data  in  renal  impaired  subjects  (Studies  PSZ-1001,  PSZ-3001  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014

PSZ-3003) to address the CHMP concern over the validity of the model for the purpose of simulation. 
An adapted covariate model was developed (see Table 7). 
Table 7. Modeling of adolescent population PK with different covariates 
When  testing  BW,  age  and  CrCL  independently  as  covariates  on  CL/F  in  the  adolescent  dataset,  only 
BW  was  statistically  significant  as  a  covariate.  Including  BW,  and  testing  age  and  CrCL  in  addition  to 
BW did not result in further statistical improvements of the model fit. However, as more than 60% of 
paliperidone  is  eliminated  unchanged  through  the  kidney,  CrCL  was  included  as  a  prior  covariate  on 
CL/F,  and  BW  and  age  in  addition  to  CrCL  were  tested.  BW  in  addition  to  CrCL  was  found  to  be 
statistically significant, but age was not. Therefore, the final covariate model that had been developed 
using the adolescent data only, remained the same as presented in the original submission. 
According  to  the  MAH,  the  population  PK  parameter  values  derived  from  the  adolescent  dataset  only 
are  well  in  line  with  those  of  the  original  analysis,  in  which  both  adolescents  and  adult  data  were 
included (see Table 8).

The Goodness of Fit (GOF) plots (Figure 9 also indicates that the model describes the data well. For the 
MAH, this confirms that the developed population PK model describes the adolescent data effectively, 
and can be used for simulation purposes.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In  study  PSZ-1001,  3  dosage  groups  were  included  (approximately  0.086,  0.129,  and  0.171 
mg/kg/day paliperidone ER) corresponding to daily doses of 6, 9, and 12 mg, respectively, for a 70-kg 
adult  on  a  milligram  per  kilogram  basis.  Consistent  findings  between  adolescents  and  adults  were 
observed in relation to the plasma concentration-time profile and time to reach the steady-state drug 
concentrations (within 4-5 days). However, the mean CL/F was lower in paediatric subjects compared 
to  healthy  adults  over  the  dose  range  4  to  12  mg  daily,  resulting  in  44%  higher  mean  steady-state 
Cmax  of  paliperidone  and  50%  higher  AUC24h.The  range  of  plasma  exposures  for  Cmax  was  similar 
whereas the upper threshold of the AUC range was higher in adolescents in comparison to adults (1750 
versus  1563  ng.h/mL).  The  overall  findings  led  the  MAH  to  a  weight-based  dosing  for  the  phase  3 
study PSZ-3001 with a threshold of 51 kg to ensure that lower-weight subjects were not given too high 
a dose. Because the substantial inter-individual PK variability was only partly explained by differences 
in body weight in the phase 3 study PSZ-3001, a weight–based dosing approach was not used in the 
other  phase  III  study  PSZ-3003.  In  addition,  the  effect  of  body  weight  on  CL/F  was  found  to  be 
relatively small in the combined PSZ-1001/PSZ-3001 dataset as compared to the PSZ-1001 alone.

Overall, the mean age of adolescents included in study PSZ-1001 was 14 years. Sixteen patients were 
14 years and older in comparison to 8 patients aged 12 and 13 years old. Only 5 patients were both 
younger  than  14  years  and  had  a  body  weight  less  than  51  kg.  However,  patients  younger  than  14 
years were included in the phase 3 study PSZ-3001. Taking into account the combined PSZ-1001/PSZ-
3001  dataset,  the  CHMP  considered  that  sufficient  information  was  available  to  characterise  the 
influence  of  body  weight  and  age  on  the  pharmacokinetics  in  the  full  population  from  12-17  years 
inclusive. 
In the popK analysis, the final model initially presented for adolescents was actually a model combining 
adult and adolescent data. The estimated parameters did not represent the PK in adolescents and were 
rather  representative  of  the  PK  in  the  broader  population.  The  effect  of  renal  function  on  total 
clearance was incorporated in the model. The estimated slope for the relation between CL/F and CLCr 
did not seem to be in line with the reduction in CL/F observed in subjects with varying degree of renal 
impairment.  The  observed  decrease  in  CL/F  was  32%  in  mild  (CLCr  =  50  to  <  80  mL/min),  64%  in 
moderate (CLCr = 30 to < 50 mL/min), and 71% in severe (CLCr = < 30 mL/min) renal impairment. 
The  estimate  of  the  slope  in  the  adult  model  was  0.0512.  Assuming  a  CLCr  of  120  mL/min  as  the 
reference, the model predicted decrease in CL/F was approximately 20%, 30% and 40% for adults. For 
the  combined  adult  and  adolescent  data  the  slope  was  0.0240,  predicting  an  even  lower  decrease  in 
CL/F due to renal impairment. Furthermore, the model did not account for the effect of body weight on 
volume  of  distribution.  From  the  CHMP  viewpoint,  the  initial  model  was  not  sufficiently  qualified  for 
purpose  of  simulation  unless  it  could  give  a  correct  description  of  the  pharmacokinetic  properties  of 
paliperidone.  To  address  this  concern,  the  MAH  provided  a  revised  model  using  only  the  data  in 
adolescents  ie  excluding  the  adult  data  and  the  data  in  renal  impaired  subjects  (Studies  PSZ-1001, 
PSZ-3001 and PSZ-3003). To this extent, an adapted covariate model was developed and resulted in a 
final covariate model that remained the same as presented in the original submission (see Tables 7-8, 
Figure  9).  As  more  than  60%  of  paliperidone  is  eliminated  unchanged  through  the  kidney,  CrCL  was 
included as a prior covariate on CL/F, and BW and age in addition to CrCL were tested. However, the 
CHMP  remained  concerned  that  the  proposed  model  including  CrCL  on  CL/F  was  misleading  because 
the  relation between  Cl/F  and  renal  elimination  capacity  (expressed  as  creatinine  clearance)  that  had 
been  established  in  adults  could  not  be  confirmed  in  adolescents  due  to  lack  of  data.  The  CHMP 
therefore concluded that the presented model could be used for simulations of exposure in adolescents 
with normal renal function only. In this model, it was sufficiently well demonstrated that the clearance 
of paliperidone is related to body size (weight). The exponent describing relation between body weight 
and  CL/F  is  0.68,  a  value  close  to  the  theoretical  allometric  relation  (0.75).  However,  due  to  the 
substantial inter-individual variability in CL/F (CV% 57.4), the explanatory value of weight on CL/F was 
reduced although it was still a valid factor on the  population level. The MAH illustrated  the variability 
with simulations showing that there was a large overlap in exposure comparing adolescents to adults 
as  well  as  when  comparing  adolescents  <51  kg  to  adolescents  ≥51  kg.  Thus,  individual  dose  titration 
was considered by the CHMP sufficiently motivated from a pharmacokinetic viewpoint.  
When investigating independently the effect of age and body weight on the clearance of paliperidone to 
accurately  characterise  the  dose-response,  body  weight,  and  not  age,  was  a  significant  predictor  of 
clearance. In the study samples there was evidence that age and body weight was not as correlated as 
might  be  expected  from  the  healthy  population.  There  were  no  signs  that  patients  below  14  years  of 
age deviate from the relation between CL/F and body weight. Therefore, the PK of paliperidone could 
be considered to have been sufficiently characterized in patients down to 12 years of age.  
Following  the  restriction  of  the  proposed  indication  to  the  paediatric  age  range  of  15  years  and  older 
(see  2.4.6),  the  MAH  proposed  that  same  dosing  adjustments  in  case  of  renal  impairment  should  be 
recommended  for  adolescent  and  adults  patients,  because  the  maturation  of  the  renal  function  is

considered  completed  by  early  childhood  and  the  pharmacokinetic  and  plasma  protein  binding  of 
paliperidone were found similar in these populations. This proposal was accepted by the CHMP. 
In  addition,  the  time  course  of  PANSS  score  and  the  influence  of  exposure  to  paliperidone  and  other 
covariates  had  not  been  evaluated  by  modelling  as  compared  to  the  presented  popPK  analysis.  This 
made it difficult to draw any conclusion about the relation between paliperidone exposure and clinical 
effect.  In  adults,  a  continuous  relation  between  plasma  exposure  to  paliperidone  and  the  risk  of 
developing EPS has been previously established. For adolescents, a similar pattern was seen but with 
the risk of EPS sharply increasing at exposure levels > 20 ng/mL. In addition, there was a slight trend 
towards adolescents having a higher risk of EPS compared to adults at exposure levels > 20 ng/mL. A 
higher  frequency  of  EPS  was  reported  more  often  in  adolescents  than  in  adults  based  on  a  pooled 
safety analysis. This is further discussed in 2.5.7.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall,  the  clinical  pharmacology  of  Invega  has  been  adequately  documented  and  meet  the 
requirements to support this application. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The development program completed to support the proposed extension of indication consisted of:

a  Phase  I,  multicenter  and  open-label  study  (PALIOROS-PSZ-1001)  to  investigate  the 
pharmacokinetic  profile,  safety  and  tolerability  of  paliperidone  ER  in  children  and  adolescent 
patients  (10-17  years)  with  schizophrenia,  schizoaffective  disorder,  or  schizophreniform 
disorder. 
-

(R076477-PSZ3001) evaluating 3 fixed oral doses of paliperidone ER (low: 1.5 mg; medium: 
3  mg  or  6  mg;    high:  6    mg  or  12  mg)  in  the  treatment  of  children  and  adolescent  patients, 
aged 12-17 years, with schizophrenia;

a  phase  III,  multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind,  active-controlled,  26  week  study 
(R076477-PSZ3003)  evaluating  flexible  oral  doses  of  paliperidone  ER  (3-9mg)  versus 
aripiprazole  (5-15mg)  in  the  treatment  of  children  and  adolescent  patients,  aged  12-17 
yearswith schizophrenia 
- 
a phase III, multicenter, open-label, 2 year study (R076477-PSZ-3002), designed to provide 
additional  long  term  safety  data  of  paliperidone  ER  in  the  paediatric  population.  Patients  who 
had completed study R076477-PSZ3001 were offered to continue in this study. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No  specific  dose  response  study  was  performed  in  the  intended  paediatric  population.  Dosing 
recommendation is derived from the combined clinical data (PSZ-3001, PSZ-3003 and PSZ-3002) and 
the  population  PK  simulations  previously  presented  (see  2.3.2).  This  approach  was  considered  in 
principle  acceptable  by  the  CHMP,  provided  the  presented  data  adequately  support  the  proposed 
dosing recommendation in the intended paediatric population. This is further discussed in 2.4.6.

This study was conducted at 12 study sites in Russia, 9 sites in the United States, 7 sites in India, 6 
sites in the Ukraine, and 1 site in Romania. 
2.4.2.1.  Methods 
Study participants 
Subjects  were  to  be  male  or  female  aged  12-17  years  inclusive  with  a  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia 
according  to  DSM-IV  at  least  one  year  prior  to  screening.  Diagnosis  had  to  be  established  using  the 
semi  structured  K-SADS-PL  questionnaire  and  the  subject  should  have  had  at  least  one  adequate 
treatment course with antipsychotic drug prior to enrolment.  There should be an acute exacerbation of 
schizophrenia  with  PANSS  score  total  between  60-120  inclusive  at  the  time  of  enrolment  (screening) 
and at the time of randomisation (baseline). 
Treatments 
The subjects were randomised to receive paliperidone ER 1.5 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg or 12 mg as  tablets or 
placebo.  During  screening  and  washout  the  subjects  were  outpatients  or  hospitalized  if  judged 
necessary  by  the  investigator.  The  study  consisted  of  three  phases;  a  screening  phase  of  up  to  3 
weeks  to  assess  eligibility  criteria,  a  six  week  double  blind  treatment  phase  with  an  end  of  study  or 
early withdrawal visit and finally a 1 week follow up visit for subjects who did not enter the open label 
safety  study  PSZ  -3002.  Subjects  were  able  to  enrol  into  the  long  term  study  PSZ-3002  after 
completing at least 21 days of treatment in study PSZ-3001. 
No dosage adjustment was permitted during the study. The study allowed early rescue. Subjects who 
did not have any response to treatment or whose symptoms worsened could drop out after at least 21 
days  of  the  double-blind  phase  and  were  eligible  to  participate  in  open-label  safety  study  PSZ-3002. 
Subjects  who  did  not  respond  to  treatment  or  whose  symptoms  worsened  before  21  days  of  the 
double-blind phase discontinued the study at any time and were treated by their physicians as clinically 
appropriate. In addition, the protocol allowed the use of rescue medications including benzodiazepines 
for insomnia and anticholinergic medications for EPS. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 3 weight based fixed –dose 
groups  of  paliperidone  ER  (to  fully  explore  tolerability);  1.5mg,  3mg,  6mg  and  12  mg  compared  to 
placebo in adolescents 12-17 years with DSM-IV based diagnosis of schizophrenia who were currently 
experiencing an acute exacerbation.

Sample size 
The estimated sample size of 200 subjects (approximately 50 in each blinded group) assumed that the 
standard  deviation  (SD)  of  the  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  PANSS  total  score  would  be  20 
points.  If  there  were  approximately  49  subjects  per  treatment  group  who  had  Week  6  (LOCF  or 
endpoint)  PANSS  total  measurements,  the  study  was  expected  to  have  approximately  80%  power  to 
detect a clinically relevant difference of 13.2 points between any paliperidone ER group compared with 
placebo  in  the  change  from  baseline  in  PANSS  total  score,  applying  Dunnett’s  adjustment  for 
multiplicity (2-sided family wise α level of 0.05). 
Randomisation 
The randomisation was centralised, balanced by using permuted blocks of treatment and was stratified 
by study centre. 
Blinding (masking) 
Double blinding was used during the 6-week treatment period (i.e., subjects, parents, legal guardians, 
investigators, and the sponsor remained blinded to the study drug). Tablets containing different dose 
strengths of paliperidone ER and tablets containing placebo were identical in appearance. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy  and  safety  analyses  were  performed  using  the  randomly  assigned,  weight-based,  fixed-dose 
treatment groups. Additional analyses were performed using the actual paliperidone ER dose received. 
The  ITT  analysis  set  was  the  analysis  set  for  the  efficacy  analyses.  This  analysis  set  included  all 
randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  double-blind  study  drug  and  had  both  a 
baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment in the double-blind phase on any of the following 
scales: PANSS, CGAS, CGI-S or sleep VAS. 
Efficacy  analysis  involving  changes  from  baseline  to  the  final  double-blind  phase  visit  (Day  43)  used 
the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach. 
The primary variable was the change in PANSS total score from baseline to the end of the double-blind 
phase  (Day  43  or  the  last  post-baseline  assessment).  Treatment  effects  were  estimated  based  on 
least-squares (LS) means using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and country 
as  factors  and  baseline  PANSS  total  score  as  a  covariate.  A  closed  testing  procedure  using  Dunnett's 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 24/87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
test  was  used  to  adjust  for  multiple  comparisons  in  testing  the  3  paliperidone  ER  treatment  groups 
against placebo for the primary efficacy variable. 
Responders are defined as those who achieved a 20% or higher reduction from baseline in the PANSS 
total  score  at  the  last  post-baseline  assessment  in  the  double-blind  phase.  The  percent  change  of 
PANSS  was  defined  as  [100*CHANGE  /  (BASELINE-30)],  as  30  is  the  lowest  possible  value  for 
PANSS.Differences at endpoint in percentage of responders between each active treatment group and 
placebo were evaluated using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test controlling for country. 
A worst-rank analysis was also performed where subjects who discontinued due to lack of efficacy were 
assigned a rank that represented a “worst-rank score” relative to those actually observed. These ranks 
reflected the relative inverse ordering of the actual times to discontinuation, so that the earlier times of 
withdrawal  were  assigned  a  worse  ranking  than  the  later  points  in  time.  In  addition,  a  Kaplan-Meier 
plot of the time to discontinuation for those who discontinued due to lack of efficacy was generated by 
treatment group. 
To assess the sensitivity of the results, a repeated measures  mixed effects model was carried out on 
the  observed  data.  Changes  from  baseline  over  time  (observed  case)  were  modelled  using  a  mixed 
effects  model  with  time,  country,  and  treatment  as  factors  and  baseline  PANSS  total  score  as  a 
covariate.  In  addition,  a  treatment-by-time  interaction  term  was  added  to  evaluate  the  changes  in 
treatment effect over time. An unstructured variance-covariance matrix was employed. 
2.4.2.2.  Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 201 subjects met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled and randomly assigned to double 
blind  treatment  with  placebo  or  paliperidone  ER.  A  total  of  200  subjects  were  randomised  into  the 
study.  All  but  one  subject  (from  the  paliperidone  ER  high  group)  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study 
medication,  provided  both  baseline  and  at  least  one  post-baseline  efficacy  assessments  and  were 
included in the ITT analysis set. 
Information on number of subjects who completed or withdrew the study and reasons for withdrawal is 
provided in Table 10. Time to withdrawal is presented in Figure 11.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted between 8 August 2007 and 30 March 2009. 
Conduct of the study 
There was one major protocol amendment prior study enrolment. This was related to the study design 
with the objective of testing the entire range of effective doses of paliperidone ER in adults (3-12mg) 
as  well  as  a  lower  dose  (1.5mg)  to  determine  the  least  effective  dose.  Weight  based  doses  were 
chosen to minimize the risk of exposing lower weight adolescents (≥ 29 kg and < 51 kg) to high doses 
of  paliperidone  ER  and  higher  weight  adolescents  (≥  51  kg)  to  too  low  of  a  dose,  considering  that 
lower-weight  subjects  could  have  nearly  double  the  drug  exposure  of  higher-weight  subjects  on  the 
basis of available PK data from PSZ-1001.

Regarding the onset of therapeutic effect, a statistically significant improvement (p<0.05, LOCF) over 
placebo was first noted on Day 22 for the paliperidone ER Medium group and at the first assessment 
time  point  (Day  8)  for  the  paliperidone  ER  High  group.  The  statistically  significant  between-group 
differences  were  maintained  from  Day  22  to  the  Day  43  endpoint  for  the  paliperidone  ER  Medium 
group  but  were  not  maintained  from  Day  8  for  the  paliperidone  ER  High  group  (p=0.079  on  Day  22 
and p=0.075 on Day 29, LOCF). 
Regarding the responder rate, 64.4% of subjects in the paliperidone ER Medium group and 51.1% of 
those  in  the  paliperidone  ER  High  group  had  achieved  a  treatment  response.  This  compared  with 
38.9% of subjects in the paliperidone ER Low group and and 33.3% of the placebo subjects.

Ancillary analyses 
Worst  rank  analysis  showed  that  the  paliperidone  ER  Medium  and  High  treatment  groups  were 
statistically  significantly  different  from  the  placebo  group.  The  magnitude  of  the  median  change  was 
larger in both the paliperidone ER Medium and High treatment groups than the placebo group, and the 
difference from placebo was statistically significant for each group. The largest mean change occurred 
in the paliperidone ER Medium treatment group (-16 on PANSS). 
Results from the longitudinal linear models (MMRM) corroborated the findings from the LOCF analysis 
of the primary efficacy endpoint (paliperidone ER Low, p=0.4039; paliperidone ER Medium, p=0.0034; 
paliperidone ER High, p=0.065). 
STUDY PSZ3003 
The study design is presented in Figure 14. 
Figure 14: 
A total of 41 sites in 7 countries participated in the study including 6 sites in India, 1 site in Romania, 
16 sites in Russian Federation, 1 site in Slovakia, 3 sites in Spain, 8 sites in Ukraine, and 6 sites in the 
United States. 
2.4.2.3.  Methods 
Study participants 
Subjects  were  to  be  male  or  female  aged  12-17  years  inclusive  with  a  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia 
according  to  DSM-IV  at  least  one  year  prior  to  screening.  Diagnosis  had  to  be  established  using  the 
semi  structured  K-SADS-PL  questionnaire  and  the  subject  should  have  had  at  least  one  adequate 
treatment course with antipsychotic drug prior to enrolment.  There should be an acute exacerbation of 
schizophrenia with PANSS score total between 60-120 inclusive at the time of enrolment (screening). 
Treatments 
The study design consisted of 3 phases: a screening phase up to 3 weeks (with a possible overlapping 
washout period), a double-blind acute phase of 8 weeks, and a double-blind maintenance phase of 18 
weeks. The total duration of the study was approximately 29 weeks. The subjects in the paliperidone 
ER treatment group received 6 mg/day on Days 1 through 7 (Week 1), and subjects in the aripiprazole 
treatment group received 2 mg/day on Days 1 and 2, 5 mg/day on Days 3 and 4, and 10 mg/day on 
Days 5, 6, and 7. 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 32/87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beginning at Week 2 and throughout the treatment period, paliperidone ER could be given at doses of 
3, 6, or 9 mg/day, and aripiprazole may be given at doses of 5, 10, or 15 mg/day. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  paliperidone  ER  relative  to  aripiprazole  in  the 
treatment of symptoms of schizophrenia in adolescent subjects (from 12 to 17 years of age, inclusive, 
ie, from 12 to less than 18 years of age) at the Week 8 (Day 56) endpoint as measured by the change 
from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) total score.

Sample size 
The  estimated  sample  size  of  228  subjects  (114  subjects  in  each  of  2  blinded  groups)  assumed  that 
the  standard  deviation  (SD)  of  the  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  acute  (Day  56)  LOCF  in  the 
PANSS total score would be 20 points. With approximately 100 subjects per treatment group who had 
an endpoint acute (Day 56) PANSS total score, the study was expected to have at least 80% power to 
detect  a  clinically  relevant  difference  of  8  points  between  paliperidone  ER  and  aripiprazole  in  the 
change from baseline in PANSS total score, with a 2-sided α-level of 0.05. 
With an estimate of approximately 12% of randomized subjects who could discontinue before providing 
post-baseline  PANSS  total  score  measurements,  the  number  of  randomly  assigned  subjects  was 
adjusted from 100 to 114 in each treatment group. 
Randomisation 
The randomisation was centralised, balanced by using permuted blocks of treatment and was stratified 
by study centre. 
Blinding (masking) 
Double blinding was used during the 26-week treatment period (i.e., subjects, parents, legal guardians, 
investigators, and the sponsor remained blinded to the study drug). Study medication was packaged in 
blister cards containing over-encapsulated tablets. 
Statistical methods 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses were performed based on the ITT analysis set, including 
all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  double-blind  study  drug  and  had  both  a 
baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment in the double-blind phase on any of the following 
scales:  PANSS,  CGI-S,  or  PSP.  Endpoint  (Day  182)  was  defined  as  the  last  post-baseline  observation 
during  the  double-blind  treatment  phase.  Endpoint  acute  (Day  56)  was  defined  as  the  last  post-
baseline assessment in the acute double-blind phase, ie, up to the Day 56 Visit. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  in  the  PANSS  total  score  from  baseline  to  the  Week  8 
(Day  56)  endpoint.  The  changes  from  baseline  in PANSS  total score  at  both  endpoint  acute  (Day  56) 
and endpoint (Day 182) were analysed using an ANCOVA model with treatment group and country as 
fixed factors and baseline PANSS total score as a covariate. Treatment effect was estimated based on 
the difference between LS means with the 95% confidence interval.

To assess the sensitivity of the results, a repeated measures mixed effects model was carried out using 
the observed data collected through the Day 56 visit. Changes from baseline over time (observed case) 
were modelled using a mixed effects model with time, country, and treatment as factors and baseline 
PANSS  total  score  as  a  covariate.  In  addition,  a  treatment-by-time  interaction  term  was  included  to 
evaluate  the  changes  in  treatment  effect  over  time.  An  unstructured  variance-covariance  matrix  was 
employed. 
A  worst-rank  analysis  was  also  performed,  where  subjects  who  discontinued  due  to  lack  of  efficacy 
prior to the Day 56 visit were assigned a rank that represented a ”worst-rank score” relative to those 
actually  observed.  These  ranks  reflected  the  relative  inverse  ordering  of  the  actual  times  to 
discontinuation,  so  that  the  earlier  times  of  withdrawal  were  assigned  a  worse  ranking  than  the  later 
points in time. 
The proportion of subjects maintaining clinical stability at Week 26 (as measured from Week 8) as well 
as the proportion of symptom responders (defined as subjects with ≥20% (or ≥30%) reduction from 
baseline  in  PANSS  total  score  at  Week  8  and  Week  26)  was  analysed  using  the  Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel  test, controlling for country.

Table 18: Study completion/withdrawal information for PSZ-3003 
In  the  paliperidone  ER  group,  a  higher  proportion  of  subjects  (47%)  receiving  the  3  mg  mode  dose 
withdrew from the study compared with those receiving the mode dose of 6 mg (21%) or 9 mg (20%). 
In the aripiprazole group, approximately 25% of subjects withdrew from the study at the mode dose of 
10  mg  or  15  mg,  whereas  no  subject  withdrew  at  the  5  mg  mode  dose.  The  proportion  of  subjects 
withdrew from the study due to lack of efficacy was slightly higher at the paliperidone ER mode dose of 
3  mg  (7%)  compared  to  those  at  the  mode  dose  of  6  mg  (2%)  or  9  mg  (4%).  In  contrast,  a  higher 
withdrawal rate was observed for subjects receiving the aripiprazole mode dose of 10 mg (12%) or 15 
mg (10%) compared to those receiving the 5 mg mode dose (0%).

When  using  the  mode  dose  (ie  the  dose  that  was  most  frequently  taken),  the  changes  from  baseline 
were very similar across all mode doses for both treatment groups (see Table 21).  This indicates that 
the approach of flexible dosing worked. It is noted that the most frequent mode dose for paliperidone 
ER is 6 mg.

When  conducting  a  subgroup  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  variable  there  was  a  greater 
improvement  in  the  younger  subjects  (12-14  yrs)  in  the  aripiprazole  group  (-23.7)  than  in  the 
paliperidone  ER  group  (-17.5).    In  older  subjects  (15-17  yrs)  there  was  a  greater  improvement  in 
mean PANSS total score in the paliperidone ER group than in the aripiprazole group (-20.1 vs -18.5). 
in both weight groups (<51kg and ≥51 kg) improvement was similar in the mean PANSS total score at 
day 56 (around -20).

Ancillary analyses 
There was no statistically significant difference in the change from baseline to endpoint acute (Day 56) 
in  the  PANSS  total  score  based  on  the  worst  rank  analysis  between  the  paliperidone  ER  and 
aripiprazole groups (p=0.465), which is consistent with the primary analysis. 
Results  from  the  MMRM  analysis  corroborated  the  findings  from  the  LOCF  analysis  of  the  primary 
efficacy  endpoint.  Using  an  unstructured  variance-covariance  matrix  for  the  MMRM  analysis,  the 
estimated LS mean change in PANSS total score at Day 56 was -22.4 for paliperidone ER and -24.2 for 
aripiprazole (p=0.313) which is consistent with the primary analysis result.

Analysis description 
LOCF 
2.4.3.  Analysis  performed  across  trials  (pooled  analyses  and  meta-
analysis) 
Comparison on the change in the PANSS total score 
A  meta-analysis  based  on  studies:  PSZ-3001,  PSZ-3003  and  the  only  published  aripiprazole  placebo-
controlled  study  of  adolescent  schizophrenia  (Findling  RL  et  al  (2008))  was  presented.  However,  the 
CHMP  was  in  disagreement  with  the  MAH  consideration  that  the  designs  of  the  pooled  studies  were 
similar: study PSZ-3001 and the aripiprazole placebo-controlled study were 6 week studies with fixed 
doses while PSZ-3003 was an 8 week study with flexible dosing; fixed dose groups were pooled post-
hoc within studies PSZ-3001 and the aripiprazole placebo-controlled study.  Furthermore, the approach 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 47/87 
 
 
 
 
 
to perform a pooled analysis of subject level data based on simulated data as if these were observed 
data  is  generally  not  considered  valid.  For  the  indirect  comparison  of  paliperidone  with  aripiprazole 
using the data from their respective placebo-controlled trials, the assumption has also to be made that 
the treatment effects of paliperidone and aripiprazole would have been the same in the trial where the 
respective  treatment  was  not  included  as  observed  in  the  placebo  controlled  trial  where  it  was 
included,  which  is  not  verifiable.Hence,  taking  into  account  the  different  study  designs  and  the 
additional  assumptions  that  have  to  be  made  to  conduct  the  meta-analysis,  the  CHMP  considered 
highly questionable whether the meta-analysis of these studies was valid and meaningful, and whether 
it provides valid information beyond the single studies. 
Comparison on the baseline data for EU/US versus non EU/US population 
When  the  number  of  subjects  from  the  EU  was  combined  with  that  from  the  US,  the  percentages  of 
subjects  from  the  2  combined  subpopulations  were  19.5%,  34.9%,  and  16.4%  in  PSZ-3001,  PSZ-
3002, and PSZ-3003, respectively. The overall proportion of subjects from combined EU and US in all 3 
studies  was  27.8%.  The  demographic  and  psychiatric  baseline characteristics  of  subjects  from  EU/US 
were  similar  to  those  of  subjects  from  the  non-EU/non-US  in  Studies  PSZ-3001,  PSZ-3002  and  PSZ-
3003.  At 
least  90%  of  subjects  received  prior  psychotropic  medications  across  different 
country/regions. The percentage of subjects receiving atypical antipsychotic medications was higher for 
subjects  from  the  EU/US  than  those  non-EU/non-US  countries.  Additionally,  subject  baseline 
characteristics  in  Studies  PSZ-3001,  PSZ-3002,  and  PSZ-3003  were  consistent  with  those  of  subjects 
from  published  reports  in  adolescents  with  schizophrenia.  Of  note,  the  Hass  study  enrolled  subjects 
from EU and US only. Since the characteristics of subjects from the EU are similar to those from the US 
and  the  combined  EU/US  subpopulation  for  the  3  Phase  3  studies  was  over  25%,  data  from  these 
studies were considered by the MAH relevant to the EU subject population.

STUDY PSZ3002 
The study design is presented in Figure 16. 
Figure 16: 
This  study  was  conducted  at  1  site in Bulgaria,  2  sites  in  Estonia,1  site in  Finland,  5  sites  in  India,  6 
sites in Korea, 6 sites in Poland, 1 site in Romania, 12 sites in Russia, 6 sites in Ukraine, and the 15 
sites in  the US. 
2.4.4.1.  Methods 
Study participants 
This long-term study included subjects who had: a) completed double-blind treatment in PSZ-3001; b) 
discontinued  PSZ-3001  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  after  completing  at  least  21  days  of  double-blind 
Assessment report

treatment and who were expected to benefit from a continuation of paliperidone ER; or c) were aged 
between 12 and 17 years, inclusive, with K-SADS-PL confirmed DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia and 
who were directly enrolled in the study.  
Treatments 
All  enrolled  subjects  received  a  starting  dose  of  paliperidone  ER  6  mg  daily,  which  could  have  been 
increased  in  increments  of  3  mg  once  every  5  days  until  the  maximum  dose  of  12  mg/day  was 
reached. Alternatively, if the 6 mg dose was not tolerated, the dose could have been decreased to 3 or 
1.5 mg/day 
The washout period for current psychotropic medications (if necessary) was required only for subjects 
enrolling  in  this  study  directly.  For  subjects  who  enrolled  from  PSZ-3001,  the  end-of-study  or  early 
withdrawal visit of the double-blind study coincided with Day 1 of PSZ-3002. 
Subjects  entering  the  long-term  study  from  PSZ-3001  were  required  to  complete  the  Measurements 
and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) cognitive battery of tests, 
23 the K-SADS-PL screening Items ‘a’ to ‘e’ for suicide, and an ECG. 
End  of  study  (EOS)  laboratory  assessments  for  PSZ-3001  counted  as  baseline  assessments  for  PSZ-
3002. The last study day for PSZ-3001 was the same day as the baseline visit (Day 1) for PSZ-3002.  
Objectives 
All  efficacy  analyses  performed  for  this  study  were  exploratory  because  this  study  did  not  have  a 
control  group  for  comparison  and  the  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  assess  the  safety  and 
tolerability of paliperidone ER. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in the PANSS total score at the end of the 
open-label  phase  (Week  104  or  the  last  post-baseline  assessment).  Other  measures  of  efficacy 
included  the  CGI-S,  CGAS,  the  modified  MATRICS  cognition  assessment  battery,  sleep  VAS,  and  the 
PANSS negative symptom scale based on Marder factors. 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculation was performed for this study. Based on the discontinuation rate seen 
in  a  similar  study  evaluating  risperidone  in  adolescents,  approximately  400  subjects  were  to  be 
enrolled into this open-label study so that at least 100 subjects completed the 2-year open-label study 
at or above the lowest effective dose (≤3 mg) that was identified in Study R076477-PSZ-3001. 
Randomisation 
As this was an open-label, single-arm study, randomization was not applicable.  
Blinding (masking) 
As this was an open-label, single-arm study, blinding was not applicable. The treatment assignment in 
study PSZ-3001 continued to be blinded after subjects entered study PSZ-3002. 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive methods were used to present efficacy data in this open label, uncontrolled study. 
The following treatment groups were analysed: subjects previously randomly assigned to 1) placebo in 
PSZ-3001  (placebo/paliperidone);  2)  to  any  1  of  the  paliperidone  ER  dose  groups  (low,  medium,  or 
Assessment report

high)  in  PSZ-3001  (paliperidone  (DB)/paliperidone)  and  new  subjects  who  enrolled  in  the  study 
(paliperidone (NO DB)/paliperidone). 
For  all  efficacy  variables  except  for  the  cognitive  assessment  battery,  2 baseline  values  were  defined 
and  used  in  the  analyses  of  changes  from  baseline  as  follows:  Open-label  (OL)  baseline  (latest 
observation  prior  to  administration  of  open-label  paliperidone  ER  in  PSZ-3002  (including  first  day  of 
dosing  [Day  1]  in  this  study);  Double-blind  (DB)  baseline  (observation  at  the  last  visit  prior  to 
administration of double-blind study drug administration in PSZ-3001 (including Day 1). 
2.4.4.2.  Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 393 subjects were enrolled into PSZ-3002 receiving at least 1 dose of study medication, had 
a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment.  A total of 237 subjects entered the study 
directly and 156 subjects who were enrolled from PSZ-3001. See Table 26.

Only 2% of subjects had a mode dose of 1.5 mg, while 38% of subjects had a mode dose of 6 mg and 
11%  had  a  mode  dose  of  3  mg.  Approximately  30%  of  subjects  had  their  dose  increased  to  the 
maximum daily dose of 12 mg. A total of 109 evaluable subjects had exposure to paliperidone ER for 
the study duration of 2 years and 18% (n=73) had exposure to paliperidone for ≥ 2 years.

Table 29: Overview of key secondary variables 
Similar  mean  changes  in  PANSS  total  score  from  double-blind  baseline  to  open-label  endpoint  were 
observed  for  subjects  from  EU  (-30.9,  n=10),  US  (-27.1,  n=19),  EU/US  (-28.4,  n=29),  and  non-
EU/non-US  countries  (-26.7,  n=127).  Mean  change  in  PANSS  total  score  from  open-label  baseline  to 
open-label  endpoint  was  slightly  larger  in  subjects  from  non-EU/non-US  countries  (-21,  n=256)  than 
those  from  EU  (-17.1,  n=78),  US  (-13.6,  n=59),  and  EU/US  (-15.6,  n=137).  Reduction  (ie, 
improvement) in PANSS total scores was observed from open-label baseline to open-label endpoint in 
both age groups of 12 to 14 and 15 to 17 years old with numerically greater decreases noted for the 
older group. In the total group, the magnitude of the mean decrease (improvement) from open-label 
baseline  to  endpoint  in  PANSS  total  score  was  higher  for  non-US  subjects  than  the  US  subjects,  and 
was numerically slightly greater for the non-EU subjects (-19.6, N=315) than the EU subjects (-17.1, 
N=78). 
Across  different  regions,  over  55%  of  subjects  achieved  a  20%  or  higher  reduction  in  PANSS  total 
score from open-label baseline to endpoint. A slightly higher proportion of subjects from non-EU/non-

US countries (69.9%) than those from EU (61.5%), US (59.3%), or EU/US (60.6%) achieved the 20% 
or higher reduction in PANSS total score. Similarly, a higher percentage of subjects from non-EU/non-
US (60.9%) than those from EU (48.7%), US (54.2%), or EU/US (51.1%) achieved a 30% or higher 
reduction in PANSS total score from open-label baseline to open-label endpoint.  
Figure 19 shows the mean (+/-SE) PANSS total scores over time for the 2 age groups (12 to 14 and 15 
to17  years).  Decrease  (ie,  improvement)  in  the  PANSS  total  scores  was  observed  from  open-label 
baseline to open-label endpoint in both age groups, although the improvement was numerically better 
for the older group.

2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The presented data (study PSZ-3001, PSZ-3003 and PSZ-3002) are part of an agreed PIP. The studies 
were  conducted  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the 
treatment of schizophrenia (EMA/CHMP/40072/2010 Rev.1). Studies in subjects younger than 12 years 
of age were not conducted given the low incidence of  schizophrenia and the difficulty of establishing a 
diagnosis  in  this  age  group.  All  three  phase  3  studies  used  similar  entry  criteria,  restrictions  to 
concomitant  medications,  rating  scales  and  endpoints.  The  studies  however  differed  with  regard  to 
duration  of  treatment  and  assessment  time  points,  blinding  (double-blind  [PSZ-3001  and  3003]  or 
open-label [PSZ-3002]), control (placebo [PSZ-3001] or active [PSZ-3003]) and dosing regimen (fixed 
[PSZ-3001] or flexible dose of paliperidone ER [PSZ-3003 and 3002]). Diagnosis of schizophrenia was 
made according to the DSM-IV at least 1 year before screening.  
Given the study designs were not the same and considering the additional assumptions that have to be 
made to conduct a meta-analysis, the CHMP considered highly questionable whether the meta-analysis 
of these studies was valid and meaningful and whether it provided valid information beyond the single 
studies.  
The  change  from  baseline  in  the  PANSS  total  score  at  endpoint  was  the  primary  efficacy  variable  in 
studies PSZ-3001, PSZ-3003 and PSZ-3002 (exploratory only). Secondary endpoints included changes 
from baseline to endpoint in CGI-S score, CGAS score and Sleep VAS (only PSZ-3001) and PSP score 
(only  PSZ-3003).  The  choice  of  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  was  considered  adequate  by  the 
CHMP. No cognitive endpoint was included with the exception of the Cognitive Assessment Battery of 
Tests  which  was  performed  on  an  exploratory  basis  in  the  open-label  study  PSZ-3002.  Additional 
analyses  such  as  responder  rate,  change  from  baseline  in  PANSS  Factor  and  Subscale  Scores  were 
undertaken and underline the clinical meaningfulness of these endpoints.  
Studies PSZ-3001 and PSZ-3003 included a total of 18 European patients. 
Study PSZ-3001 
There was one major protocol amendment prior study enrolment. This was related to the study design 
with the objective of testing the entire range of effective doses of paliperidone ER in adults (3-12mg) 
as  well  as  a  lower  dose  (1.5mg)  to  determine  the  least  effective  dose.  Weight  based  doses  were 
chosen to minimize the risk of exposing lower weight adolescents (≥ 29 kg and < 51 kg) to high doses 
of  paliperidone  ER  and  higher  weight  adolescents  (≥  51  kg)  to  too  low  of  a  dose,  considering  that 
lower-weight  subjects  could  have  nearly  double  the  drug  exposure  of  higher-weight  subjects  on  the 
basis  of  available  PK  data  from  PSZ-1001.  However  with  this  approach,  efficacy  data  are  missing  for 
the 3 mg dose in patients weighing ≥51 kg and for the 12 mg dose in patients weighing < 51 kg.  
The time pattern for total number of withdrawals was similar for all groups up to day 21 when higher 
withdrawal rate in the placebo group and to a lower extent in the paliperidone ER Low group became 
apparent. This is the time point where subjects could enter the open label phase study (PSZ-3002) and 
thus  this  finding  may  be  expected.The  rate  of  withdrawals  in  the  paliperidone  ER  low  group  had  a 
higher  number  of  withdrawals  due  to  Lack  of  Efficacy  (26%)  than  the  other  dose  groups.    A  total  of 
29%  withdrew  from  the  study  and  of  those  17%  from  the  paliperidone  ER  medium  treatment  group 
withdrew. The study duration was short and the withdrawal rate was high. The study was conducted all 
over  the  world  with  a  very  limited  number  of  patients  from  the  EU.  Only  10  patients  (5%)  from 
Romania were included. Overall baseline disease severity as measured by PANSS total score and CGI-S 
Assessment report

score was comparable across all arms but the paliperidone ER group Medium had fewer subjects with 
moderate CGI-S score(n=19, 40%) and more subjects with high CGI-S scores than the other groups. 
Taking the improvements over time observed in the placebo completers and the high drop-out rate in 
the placebo group into account, the LOCF analysis was not necessarily conservative. The pre-specified 
sensitivity  analyses  are  acknowledged;  in  particular,  the  MMRM  analysis  is  considered  relevant. 
However, the clinical interpretation of the worst-rank analysis is difficult as this analysis “mixes” effects 
on  the  variables  ‘change  in  PANSS  total  score’  and  ‘time  to  treatment  discontinuation  due  to  lack  of 
efficacy’, whereby the clinical relevance of the latter is questionable, particularly since no clear criteria 
to  determine  lack  of  efficacy  seemed  to  have  been  applied.  It is  generally  recommended  to  minimize 
the occurrence of missing data in a clinical trial; therefore allowing discontinuation of study for lack of 
efficacy  in  the  protocol  may  be  considered  as  an  issue.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  recommended 
criterion  for  lack  of  efficacy  in  the  study  protocol  was  an  increase  of  20%  in  PANSS  total  score; 
however,  the  mean  increase  for  the  drop-outs  in  the  placebo  group  was  actually  lower  (9%).  The 
pattern  of  PANSS  total  scores  for  patients  who  dropped  out  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  was  found  to  be 
different from those who completed the study, supporting that lower efficacy was indeed observed at 
drop-out  time  .  Consequently,  the  CHMP  considered  the  worst-case  analysis  as  conservative.  The 
patterns of PANSS total scores for patients who dropped out due to lack of efficacy suggested that the 
PANSS  total  scores  were  not  temporarily  but  continuously  increased  for  most  of  these  patients, 
meaning that the imputation of the best value leads to an overestimation of the placebo effect. In the 
best observation carried forward analysis, the treatment effects were generally lower compared to the 
primary  analysis,  which  is  explained  by  a  higher  drop-out  rate  in  the  placebo  group,  leading  to  a 
conservative  analysis.  A  significant  treatment  effect  was  however  found  for  the  medium  dose  group 
(<51 Kg: 3 mg/day; ≥51 Kg:6 mg/day) but not for the high (<51 Kg:6 mg/day; ≥51 Kg:12 mg/day) 
and the low (1.5 mg/day) dose group, which was consistent with the primary analysis. 
Studies PSZ-3003 and PSZ-3002 
In  study  PSZ-3003,  the  age  distribution  was  not  homogenous  as  across  the  treatment  groups  12-14 
year  olds  were  only  accounted  for  about  1/3  of  the  study  population.    Baseline  disease  severity  was 
similar across the groups.. The LS Mean Change from baseline on PANSS total score decreases up to 
day  140  and  then  increases  in  both  treatment  groups  at  day  182.  According  to  the  MAH,  this  finding 
was due to the only subject enrolled in Slovakia and an analysis excluding this subject was performed 
showing  continuous  decrease  through  day  182  in  both  treatment  groups.  Since  consistent  findings 
were  observed  when  including  this  patient  and  the  region  as  a  factor  (instead  of  country)  in  the 
ANCOVA  analysis,  this  explanation  was  considered  plausible  by  the  CHMP.  A  total  of  15  European 
patients were recruited. 
In study PSZ-3002, the design was open label without any comparator or placebo thus making difficult 
the assessment of the magnitude of treatment effect. The efficacy data for this study were considered 
exploratory only.Although the withdrawal rate was high with a total of 55% completing study of which 
184 completed the two years which means a total of 46% completed the total two year study.  This is 
however not unexpected in this population as the study had a long duration.  Seventy-three (73%) of 
subjects were 15 years and older. Only 10 European patients were included. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study PSZ-3001 
Results  indicated  that  the  study  achieved  its  primary  objective  by  demonstrating  that  at  least  one 
paliperidone ER weight-based group was statistically superior to placebo in improving the symptoms of 
schizophrenia  as  measured  by  the  change  in  PANSS  total  score  from  baseline  to  endpoint  (LOCF 
analysis). 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 64/87 
 
 
 
 
Only  the  medium  paliperidone  ER  weight-based  group  (<51  Kg:  3  mg/day;  ≥51  Kg:  6  mg/day)  was 
statistically  superior  to  placebo  in  improving  the  symptoms  of  schizophrenia  as  measured  by  the 
change  in  PANSS  total  score  from  baseline  to  endpoint  (p=0.006).  The  paliperidone  ER  Low 
(1.5mg/day)  and  High  (<51  Kg:  6  mg/day;  ≥51  Kg:  12  mg/day)  groups  did  not  show  statistical 
significance in comparison to placebo on the primary endpoint (p= 0.508 and 0.086, respectively).   
The  analysis  across  weight  categories  indicated  that  for  adolescents  <  51  kg,  only  the  medium  dose 
group (3 mg) separated from placebo whereas for adolescent ≥ 51 kg , the medium (6mg)  and high 
dose groups (12 mg) separated from placebo.  
The  consistency  of  the  treatment  effect  across  the  body  weight  categories  was  explored  by  including 
the  treatment-by-baseline  body  weight  interaction  in  the  model  used  for  primary  analysis.  This 
interaction  was  significant  at  the  pre-specified  10%  level  (p=0.08),  possibly  indicating  inconsistent 
treatment effects across body weight categories.  
These  findings  further  supported  the  need  for  weight  based  dosing  recommendation  (see  below 
justification for the dose). 
Efficacy  analyses  of  the  secondary  endpoints  including  CGI-S,  CGAS,  sleep  VAS  and  PANSS  factor 
scores were consistent with the findings of the primary efficacy analysis. The results for the responder 
rates  (≥20  and  30  %)  support  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  primary  endpoint.  As  with  the  primary 
efficacy  endpoint  the  medium  dose  treatment  group  performed  the  best.  The  CHMP  noted  that  this 
completion  rate  was  higher  than  the  rates  in  the  6-week  studies  in  adults  (range  43  to  66%).The 
proportion of subjects who completed the study was higher in the 3 mg (81%), 6 mg (82%), and 12 
mg  (77%)  dose  groups  than  in  the  1.5  mg  dose  group  (65%)  and  the  placebo  group  (51%).  The 
proportion  of  subjects  who  were  withdrawn  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  was  higher  in  the  placebo  group 
(39%) and 1.5 mg dose group (26%) than in the other paliperidone ER dose groups (ranging from 0% 
in the 3 mg dose group to 9% in the 6 mg dose group). 
Post-hoc analyses by actual dose received by the subjects showed statistically significant improvement 
relative to placebo in the PANSS total scores at endpoint (LOCF) for the paliperidone ER 3, 6, and 12 
mg  dose  groups.  However,  no  clear  dose  response  pattern  was  observed,  which  might  be  due  to  the 
low  number  of  patients  in  the  3  mg  dose  group  (n=16).  The  difference  of  LS  mean  changes  from 
baseline  to  endpoint  was  -11.5,  -6.8,  and  -9.0,  respectively;  nominal  p  values  of  0.016,  0.044,  and 
0.014,  respectively,  with  no  multiplicity  adjustment.  Results  in  the  1.5  mg  dose  group  were  not 
statistically  significant  (difference  of  LS  means  of  -2.1;  p=0.507).  The  changes  in  mean  PANSS  total 
score from baseline to endpoint for the 3 mg actual dose groups were comparable to those observed in 
studies  in  the  adult  population  (-11.1  for  the  3mg  dose  for  the  pooled  data  of  the  three  6  week 
placebo-controlled  studies  [R076477-SCH-303,  304  and  305]  in  adults).  However,  the  effect  sizes  of 
the 6mg and the 12 mg actual dose groups were less comparable (-11.0 for the 6 mg and -14.5 for the 
12  mg  dose  groups  in  the  pooled  adult  studies).  The  higher  placebo  response  in  adolescents(-7.9 
versus -4.8) that has been also described in the literature may be associated with such findings. The 
improvement  in  the  paliperidone  ER  Medium  group  achieved  statistical  significance  compared  to  the 
paliperidone ER Low group (p = 0.014). The differences between the paliperidone ER High and Medium 
group  or  High  and  Low  group  did  not  achieve  statistical  significance  (p  =  0.289  and  p  =  0.170, 
respectively).  
Similarly  to  the  overall  study  results,  the  medium  dose  group  showed  better  improvement  in  PANSS 
total score in all analysed subgroups : (a) <15 yrs/<51kg, (b) <15 yrs/≥ 51 kg, (c) ≥ 15 yrs/<51 kg, 
and (d) ≥15 yrs/≥51 kg (see Tables 32-33).  Among patients between 12-14 years and patients <51 
kg, a better improvement in PANSS total score compared to placebo was observed only in  the medium 
(3 mg) dose group, while a better dose-improvement trend was observed in patients 15-17 years old

or patients ≥51kg (See Tables 30-31). However the relatively small proportion of patients aged 12-14 
years  is  of  concern  to  conclude  on  these  efficacy  findings.  In  addition,  the  effect  on  the  PANSS  total 
score was considered weaker in this population, in the medium dose group, the difference of LS mean 
changes from baseline to endpoint was -15.5 in patients aged 12-14 years and -18.1 in patients aged 
15-17 years, respectively. 
Based  on  additional  ANCOVA  and  regression  analyses,  the  treatment  response  was  claimed  to  be 
independent of age when body weight was taken into account. However, as the sample sizes are even 
smaller  in  these  subgroups,  these  comparisons  should  be  only  taken  into  account  as  exploratory 
findings.  
Study PSZ-3003  
This study provided maintenance data over 26 weeks. However, it did not meet its primary objective, 
i.e.  paliperidone  ER  did  not  demonstrate  superior  efficacy  compared  to  aripiprazole.  Nevertheless, 
robust  and  clinically  meaningful  reductions  (ie,  improvements)  in  mean  PANSS  total  score  from 
baseline  to  endpoint  acute  (Day  56,  LOCF)  in  the  paliperidone  ER  (-19.3)  and  aripiprazole  (-19.8) 
groups  were  observed.  The  confidence  interval  of  the  difference  between  the  two  groups  excluded 
larger changes than 3.8 to the advantage of aripiprazole. This finding cannot be considered a clinically 
relevant  difference  between  the  two  treatments  and  therefore  the  study  could  only  be  interpreted  as 
showing  non  inferiority.    The  changes  from  baseline  for  aripiprazole  are  of  a  similar  magnitude  as  in 
previous studies in a paediatric population, and for paliperidone ER in the same magnitude as in study 
3001. A PP analysis was provided and was found consistent with the ITT analysis, with a larger upper 
bound  of  the  95%  CI  (4.38  versus  3.76).  In  the  absence  of  adequate  justification  for  the  assay 
sensitivity in study PSZ-3003, the CHMP considered that non inferiority conclusions could not be fully 
claimed based on this study. 
The  analyses  of  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  consistent  with  the  findings  from  the  primary 
efficacy  analyses.  The  results  indicated  that  paliperidone ER  and  aripiprazole  had  similar  treatment 
effects  with  regard  to  decreasing  the  PANSS  total  scores  over  the  26-week  period.  The  mean  (SD) 
decrease  in  PANSS  total  score  from  baseline  to  endpoint  (Day 182)  was  -25.6  (16.88)  for 
paliperidone ER  and  -26.8  (18.82)  for  aripiprazole.  From  endpoint  acute  (Day 56)  to  endpoint 
(Day 182), over 50% of the subjects in both treatment groups remained clinically stable. Comparable 
long-term improvements by Day 182 for paliperidone ER and aripiprazole treatments were noted with 
regard to the change from baseline to endpoint (Day 182) for the CGI-S score and in the PSP scale. In 
addition,  there  was  no  statistical  significant  differences  in  responder  rates  (paliperidone:  76%, 
aripiprazole:  81.6%,  p=0.444).  However  it  is  difficult  to  draw  any  conclusions  on  the  magnitude  of 
difference  since  no  confidence  intervals  have  been  presented.  Furthermore,  at  least  75%  of  subjects 
completed the 26-week study in both groups and the withdrawal rates due to lack of efficacy were low 
(4%  for  paliperidone  and  10%  for  aripiprazole).  The  longitudinal  analysis  using  MMRM  performed  on 
the observed-case data and the worst-rank analysis corroborated the findings from the LOCF analysis. 
An analysis using the per-protocol analysis set (excluding subjects who had major protocol deviations 
from the ITT analysis set) was also conducted as a sensitivity analysis for the primary analysis. Results 
from this analysis were consistent with the ITT analysis. 
In subgroup analyses, concerning the primary study endpoint related to change in PANSS total score, 
similar  results  were  obtained  in  age  and  weight  groups,  at  day  56  comparing  aripiprazole  and 
paliperidone treated patients.  Similarly to the short term efficacy, the maintenance of the effect on the 
PANSS  total  score  was  considered  weaker  in  this  population  in  the  paliperidone  ER  group,  the 
difference of LS mean changes from baseline to endpoint was -17.5 in patients aged 12-14 years and -
20.1  in  patients  aged  15-17  years,  respectively.  However,  slightly  better  results  for  aripiprazole 
treatment  compared  to  paliperidone  in  subjects  aged  between  12-14  years,  15-17  years  and 
subjects≥51 kg were observed in maintaining clinical stability over 26 weeks (see Tables 34-35).

Study PSZ-3002  
Improvement  in  the  PANSS  total  scores  were  observed  during  the  first  3  months  of  the  open-label 
treatment in all 3 treatment groups. The improvements in PANSS total scores observed during the first 
3  months  were  maintained  during  the  remaining  portion  of  the  study.  The  subjects  who  entered  the 
open  label  study  directly  without  prior  participation  in  PSZ-3001  and  those  who  rolled  over  from  the 
placebo  arm  in  study  PSZ-3001  showed  a  greater  decrease  from  baseline  in  PANSS  total  score 
compared to those rolling over from the active treatment arms. This is probably due to a higher open 
label baseline PANSS total score, and therefore expected. All groups seem to converge towards similar 
levels  in  PANSS  total  score  over  time.  The  primary  efficacy  variable  for  the  exploratory  secondary 
objective  was  the  change  from  open-label  baseline  to  open-label  endpoint  in  the  PANSS  total  score. 
The efficacy analysis was based on the ITT analysis set which comprised of 393 subjects. There were 
mean decreases in PANSS total scores (indicating improvement) after administration of paliperidone ER 
from open-label baseline to open-label endpoint, the highest means (SD) change (-22.4 [22.25]) was 
noted in the Paliperidone (NO DB)/Paliperidone treatment group and the lowest change (-12.6 [19.92]) 
was  noted  in  the  Paliperidone  (DB)/Paliperidone  treatment  group.  The  mean  (SD)  change  in  PANSS 
total  score  from  double-blind  baseline  to  open-label  endpoint  was  slightly  higher  in  the  Paliperidone 
(DB)/Paliperidone treatment group (-27.5 [19.09]) than in the Placebo/Paliperidone treatment group (-
25.7 [16.01]).Other efficacy analyses including the CGI-S, CGAS, sleep VAS, and PANSS factor scores 
corroborated the findings of the primary efficacy variable. Small improvements in performance on tests 
of  cognitive  function  were  observed  in  all  groups  from  open-label  baseline  to  the  6-month  time  point 
for  most  domains.  These  data  are  supportive  that  the  clinical  efficacy  of  paliperidone  ER  continues 
beyond 6 weeks and is maintained with long-term therapy up to two years.  
According  to  the  Schizophrenia  Guideline  (EMA/CHMP/40072/2010  Rev.1),  data  on  maintenance  of 
effect  may  be  extrapolated  from  adults  to  adolescents  as  of  the  age  of  15  years.  The  overall  data  to 
support  extrapolation  of  long-term  efficacy  from  12  years  onwards  were  not  considered  to  be 
sufficient.  Subgroup  analyses  based  on  age  and  weight  did  not  reveal  any  significant  difference  in 
improvement in PANSS during the course of 2 year treatment. However, among younger adolescents a 
lower  percentage  of  subjects  who  maintained  a  30%  PANSS  response  over  time  was  observed 
compared to patients in 15-17 years. No difference was observed between weight groups (See Figures 
20-23).Hence  the  CHMP  maintains  its  previous  conclusion  that  the  maintenance  of  the  efficacy  in 
patients younger than 15 years remains to be established.  
Overall discussion on efficacy 
Following the CHMP concerns over the lack of sufficient evidence of short term and long term efficacy 
in  subjects  aged  between  12-14  years,  the  MAH  proposed  to  restrict  the  proposed  indication  to 
treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adolescents  15  years  and  older.  As  discussed  above,  better  dose-
improvement  trend  in  PANSS  total  score  was  observed  in  patients  15-17  years  old.  In  addition, 
consistent efficacy findings were observed for the subgroup analyses (≥15 years, ≥51 kg and <51 kg) 
provided  at  the  CHMP  request  on  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  of  particular  clinical  relevance.  To 
provide  further  supporting  evidence  for  the  short  term  efficacy  in  the  15  to  17  year  age  range,  the 
MAH  repeated  the  ANCOVA  analysis  for  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  variables  in  the  placebo 
controlled study (PSZ-3001) in the 15 to 17 year subgroup. Statistically significant differences versus 
placebo  were  observed  in  both  the  Medium  (<51  Kg:  3  mg/day;  ≥51  Kg:  6  mg/day,  p=0.005)  and 
High  (<51  Kg:  6  mg/day;  ≥51  Kg:  12  mg/day,  p=0.012)  dose  groups  of  paliperidone  ER  for  the 
primary  endpoint  (change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  PANSS  total  score).  According  to  the  MAH, 
these results are more robust than those observed for the total population (12 to 17 years), which only 
Assessment report

showed  a  statistically  significant  difference  versus  placebo  for  the  Medium  dose  level  (<51  Kg:  3 
mg/day; ≥51 Kg: 6 mg/day,). 
Taking  into  account  the  overall  short  term  and  long  term  efficacy  data  (as  discussed  above)  and 
additional subgroup analyses provided for the 15 to 17 year subgroup, the CHMP considered there was 
sufficient  evidence  to  support  the  efficacy  of  paliperidone  ER  in  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in 
patients 15 years and older. 
Justification of the dose 
According to the MAH, results from the double-blind placebo-controlled study PSZ-3001 established the 
efficacy  of  paliperidone  ER  in  improving  the  symptoms  and  severity  of  schizophrenia  compared  to 
placebo based on the primary analysis of weight-based dose groups. Analyses by actual dose received 
indicated  efficacy  across  the  dose  range  of  3  to  12  mg/day,  with  3  mg/day  being  the  minimum 
effective  dose;  whereas  no  statistical  separation  from  placebo  was  demonstrated  for  the  1.5  mg  for 
any of the efficacy variables. Only the medium dose group comprising the doses of 3 mg and 6 mg (for 
adolescents  < 51 kg and ≥ 51 kg, respectively) was efficacious from a strict interpretation viewpoint, 
as  the  high  dose  group  (<51  Kg:  6  mg/day;  ≥51  Kg:  12  mg/day)  was  not  statistically  significantly 
different  from  placebo  (p=0.086).  Post-hoc  analysis  by  actual  dose  group  indicated  that  there  is  a 
treatment effect of paliperidone ER in the dose range of 3 mg to 12 mg/day.  
From  the  CHMP  viewpoint,  no  clear  dose-response  pattern  was  identified  with  respect  to  efficacy  for 
the  primary  endpoint  for  the  paliperidone  ER  3,  6  and  12  mg  dose  groups  (difference  of  LS  mean 
changes  from  baseline  to  endpoint  of  -11.5,  -6.8,  and  -9.0,  respectively;  nominal  p  values  of  0.016, 
0.044,  and  0.014,  respectively).  This  might  be  due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  in  the  3  mg  dose 
group (n=16). The improvement in the paliperidone ER Medium group achieved statistical significance 
compared to the paliperidone ER Low group (p = 0.014). The differences between the paliperidone ER 
High and Medium group or High and Low group did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.289 and p 
=  0.170,  respectively).  A  statistically  significant  dose-response  relationship  was  found  using  a  linear 
trend  test  and  the  non-parametric  Jonckhere-Terpstra  trend  test  (post-hoc  analyses).  However, 
considering  the  observed  responses  for  the  actual dose  groups,  a  (linear)  trend  in  the  dose-response 
relationship appears unlikely, i.e. the fit of the linear model to describe the dose-response relationship 
is probably poor. The statistical significance of the trend tests is most likely driven by the differences 
between the placebo group/low dose group and the higher dose groups, but there is no clear evidence 
of a dose-response relationship for the higher doses 3, 6 and 12mg.  Overall, the number of patients in 
the lower age group (the only one that received the 3 mg) was only around one quarter of the whole 
study population and data in this subpopulation are very limited. On this basis and considering the PK 
findings  suggesting  a  dependence  of  paliperidone  clearance  on  the  patient’s  body  weight (see  2.3.4), 
the  CHMP  considered  that  the  proposed  dose  ranging  (3  to  12  mg/day)  was  not  adequate  for  the 
lower-weight patients, although the efficacy results were overall consistent with the adult data. This is 
not only due to the efficacy data but also due to the safety data where a clear dose-response pattern 
was observed for several safety parameters including common adverse events (somnolence, akathisia, 
tremor,  and  dystonia);  EPS  related  adverse  events  (hyperkinesia,  dystonia,  and  tremor)  and 
associated use of anticholinergic medications; and mean increases in body weight and BMI (see 2.5.7). 
Regarding  patients  older  than  15  years  and  ≥  51  kg,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  proposed 
dose range (3 to 12 mg/day) could be considered since these patients are more likely to have similar 
PK  profile  than  in  adults.  To  address  the  dosing  concern  over  the  lower  weight  patients,  the  MAH 
proposed to revise the initial dosing recommendation by setting a lower maximum recommended dose 
of 6 mg for children weighing <51 kg instead of 12 mg. The maximum recommended dose for children 
weighing ≥ 51 kg was proposed to be maintained at 12 mg, similarly to the adult population. Given an 
individual  dose  titration  strategy  was  supported  by  PK/PD  data,  the  CHMP  agreed  with  the  proposed 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014

revised  posology.  Taking  into  account  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  the  product  (prolonged  release 
formulation) and the available efficacy data on the 1.5 mg dose of paliperidone ER, a lower increasing 
increment of 1.5 mg was not considered beneficial in the intended population. 
Relevance of the data in the EU population 
According  to  the  MAH,  difficulties  were  encountered  in  enrolling  subjects  from  the  EU  in  Study  PSZ-
3001 due to the use of a placebo control. Enrolment of subjects into Study PSZ-3003 from the EU was 
also difficult as the active control (aripiprazole) was already approved for use in adolescents within the 
EU  and  is  often  used  as  a  first  line  treatment.  This  accounted  for  the  relatively  low  proportion  of 
subjects from the EU in the Phase 3 studies. There were only 5% and 6.6% of subjects enrolled from 
EU  countries  in  PSZ-3001  and  PSZ-3003,  respectively.  In  the  long-term,  open-label  safety  and 
tolerability study PSZ-3002, 19.8% of subjects were from the EU countries.  
On  the  other  hand  comparative  data  with  respect  to  baseline  characteristics  and  pre-treatment 
patterns  in  US/EU  versus  non-EU/non-US  were  presented.    Overall,  it  can  be  concluded  that  subject 
population  in  paliperidone  ER  studies  could  be  considered  to  be  representative  of  the  adolescent 
schizophrenia  population  in  Europe.  Subjects  in  the  US  were  generally  heavier  in  comparison  with 
subjects from Asia and Eastern Europe but subjects with heavier body weight (≥51 kg) showed similar 
or  slightly  better  efficacy  compared  to  those  with  lighter  body  weight  (<51  kg)  and  there  were  no 
apparent  differences  with  regard  to  safety  findings  between  the  2  weight  subgroups.  Even  though  a 
higher  proportion  of  subjects  from  EU/US  than  those  from  non-EU/non-US  received  atypical 
antipsychotics, the most frequently used atypical or typical antipsychotics were similar. Overall, it can 
be accepted that the data from the 3 paliperidone ER studies are applicable to the adolescent patients 
in Europe. 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the CHMP concluded that the efficacy (short term and maintenance of the effect) of Invega for 
the treatment of schizophrenia in 15 years and older has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  of  paliperidone  ER  in  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  children  and  adolescents  was 
evaluated  in  the  clinical  studies  that  were  already  discussed  in  the  clinical  efficacy:  PSZ-3001,  PSZ-
3002, PSZ-3003 and PSZ-1001. No pooled data have been provided due to a different study design for 
these studies. 
Known  safety  issues  with  paliperidone  are  extrapyramidal  side  effects  (EPS),  glucose  related  adverse 
events,  potentially  prolactin  levels  as  well  as  other  adverse  events  of  special  interest  such  as 
suicidality,  aggression,  agitation,  somnolence,  sedation,  seizures,  convulsions,  neuroleptic  malignant 
syndrome (NMS), sexual maturation, weight gain and cardiac events.   
Subjects with a history or presence of significant cardiac events/diseases and endocrine diseases were 
excluded from the studies.  
2.5.1.  Patient exposure 
In total, 545 adolescent subjects with schizophrenia received at least 1 dose of paliperidone ER during 
the three Phase III studies. The mean duration of exposure to paliperidone ER for these subjects was 
379.4 days. Data are presented in Tables 36 and 37.

Extrapyramidal Syndrome (EPS) related symptoms 
PSZ-3001 
EPS related TEAEs have not been reported for placebo but for all other paliperidone ER dosing groups 
(1.5mg,  3mg,  6mg,  and  12mg).  A  dose-related  trend  could  be  shown  for  Akathisia  (3.7%,  6.3%, 
11.1%,  and  17.1%),  Dystonia  (1.9%,  0%,  4.4%,  and  8.6%),  Tremor  (1.9%,  6.3%,  6.7%,  11.4%), 
and Muscle rigidity (0%, 0%, 2.2%, and 2.9%). 
Treatment-emergent EPS assessed by rating scale (Barnes for Akathisia) revealed 0% for placebo and 
paliperidone ER 1.5mg and higher incidences for paliperidone ER 3mg, 6mg, and 12mg (6%, 9%, and 
6%). Parkinsonism as per Simpson-Angus Scale was highest in the paliperidone ER 1.5mg group. 
A  dose-related  use  of  anticholinergic  medication  was  found  (4%,  13%,  18%,  and  31%  in  the 
paliperidone  ER  1.5mg,  3mg,  6mg,  12mg  group)  with  no  anticholinergic  medication  in  the  placebo 
group. 
Incidences  of  parkinsonism  and  akathisia  and  use  of  anticholinergic  medications  were  higher  in 
subjects <15 years old and <51 kg than those ≥15 years old and ≥51 kg, respectively. 
PSZ-3003 
EPS  related  TEAEs  were  (slightly)  higher  for  paliperidone  ER  compared  to  aripiprazole  for  all  EPS 
categories except for Dyskinesia. No cases of tardive dyskinesia were reported. The rates of dyskinesia 
(based  on  AIMS  score)  and  anticholinergic  medication  use  were slightly  higher in  the  paliperidone  ER 
group than in the aripiprazole group (3% vs. 0%, and 25% vs. 22%). Parkinsonism and Akathisia were 
similar  between  treatment  groups  based  on  rating  scale  results.  However,  in  the  <15  years  old 
subgroup, the incidences of parkinsonism and akathisia were higher in subjects receiving paliperidone 
ER (6%) than those receiving aripiprazole (3%). 
PSZ-3002  
EPS-related  TEAEs  within  the  categories  of  Parkinsonism  and  Hyperkinesia  were  most  frequently 
reported and highest in the paliperidone (NO DB)/paliperidone group . The  most commonly occurring 
(>5%) EPS-related event was akathisia (13.0%), followed by tremor (11.0%), muscle rigidity (6.5%), 
and  dystonia  (5.3%).  These  TEAEs  were  mostly  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  No  case  of  tardive 
dyskinesia  was  reported.  Further  analysis  was  conducted  regarding  the  time  course  of  EPS-related 
TEAEs.  Overall,  treatment-emergent  EPS  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  first  3  months  than  in 
subsequent months (See Table 41).

Thirty-five (35)% of the subjects received anti-EPS medication and antihistamines drug/therapy prior 
to the open-label study compared to 25.0% of subjects during the open-label study.  
Suicide related events 
PSZ-3001 
No  suicidality-related  TEAEs  were  reported  in  this  study.  Evaluation  of  the  Columbia  Classification 
Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA, retrospective assessment) revealed two patients who were 
suspect of potentially suicidality-related AEs, one in the placebo group and one in the paliperidone ER 
medium  group.  However,  these  events  turned  out  to  be  not  related  after  review.  There  was  no 
indication  of  an  increased  suicidality  risk  in  subjects  receiving  paliperidone  ER  compared  with  those 
receiving placebo. 
PSZ-3003 
Suicidality-related TEAEs occurred in 3 subjects, all in the paliperidone ER treatment group. The TEAEs 
were  suicidal  ideation  in  2  subjects  (1.8%)  and  suicide  attempt  in  2  subjects  (1.8%).  The  C-SSRS 
assessment  based  on  C-CASA  classification  confirmed  the  majority  of  subjects  from  the  paliperidone 
ER  group  with  no  suicidal  event  at  baseline  remained  non  suicidal  post-baseline  (96.4%).  The  same 
was true for aripiprazole (98.2%). 
PSZ-3002  
Suicidality-related TEAEs occurred in 37 subjects in the Total group (9.3% overall). These were suicidal 
ideation in 34 (8.5%) subjects, suicide attempt in 3 (0.8%) subjects, and suicidal behaviour in 1 
(0.3%) subject. TEAEs in this category were reported only in the paliperidone (NO DB)/ paliperidone 
treatment group. 
Further data on suicidality assessment are presented in Tables 42 and 43.

Table 43: Incidence of Any Post Baseline (OL) PSREs - Columbia Classification Algorithm of 
Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) Based on C-SSRS - for Subjects Who Completed the Study 
After Initiation of C-SSRS – Open-Label Study (PSZ-3002).  
Other psychiatric adverse events 
PSZ-3001 
TEAEs  related  to  worsening  of  psychosis  occurred  at  a  lower  incidence  with  paliperidone  ER  (6.7%) 
than with placebo (11.8%). Agitation occurred in a higher rate in placebo compared to paliperidone ER 
(7.8%  vs.  4.7%).  Aggression  was  only  reported  for  placebo-treated  patients.  No  TEAEs  of  seizure  or 
convulsion  were  reported.  Somnolence  (including  sedation)  was  highest  and  dose-related  in  the  total 
paliperidone ER group compared to placebo (16.7% vs. 3.9%).  
PSZ-3003 
TEAEs  related  to  worsening  of  psychosis  occurred  at  a  lower  incidence  with  paliperidone  ER  (4.4%) 
than with aripiprazole (12.3%). Similarly, schizophrenia was reported more frequently with aripiprazole 
compared  to  paliperidone  ER  (11.4%  vs.  3.5%).  Depressed  mood  was  slightly  higher  in  paliperidone 
ER-treated  patients  compared  to  aripiprazole  (2.7%  vs.  1.8%).  There  were  only  isolated  reports  of 
agitation  and  aggression  for  both  treatment  options.  No  reports  of  NMS,  seizure  or  convulsion. 
Somnolence  was  similar  for  paliperidone  ER  and  aripiprazole  (10.6%  vs.  10.5%).  The  percentage  of 
subjects  with  TEAEs  of  sedation  was  higher  in  paliperidone  ER  group  (5.3%)  than  in  the  aripiprazole 
group  (2.6%).  Most  of  the  TEAEs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  None  of  these  events  were 
serious. 
PSZ-3002 
The incidence of psychosis TEAEs and schizophrenia was higher compared to the other studies. A total 
55  subjects  (13.8%)  had  a  TEAE  related  to  worsening  of  psychosis.  In  the  Total  group,  50  subjects 
(12.5%)  had  a  TEAE  of  schizophrenia.  Depressed  mood  happened  in  5.5%  of  subjects.  A  total  of  17 
subjects  (4.3%)  had  a  TEAE  related  to  agitation,  and  6  subjects  (1.5%)  had  a  TEAE  related  to 
aggression. Most of these events were mild to moderate in severity. Two subjects (0.8% overall) had

TEAEs  related  to  seizures  and  convulsions  (one  case  of  petit  mal  epilepsy  and  one  case  of  tonic 
convulsion). Somnolence was reported for 23% of subjects. 
Weight gain related adverse events 
Potentially clinically significant weight gain of 7% and more was reported for 26% of patients in study 
PSZ-3003 and for 47% in study PSZ-3002, reflecting a high risk of weight gain associated with various 
comorbidities,  particularly  in  a  schizophrenic  population.  This  risk  is  clearly  more  pronounced  with 
higher doses. However, post-marketing data from adolescents in the US did not indicate a difference in 
weight increase reporting compared to adults. 
In  the  26-week  active-controlled  study  PSZ-3003,  although  there  were  26%  of  patients  with  weight 
gain  of  ≥7%,  the  changes  from  baseline  in  z-score  for  weight  and  BMI  were  0.09  and  0.13, 
respectively,  indicating  the  change  in  weight  was  clinically  insignificant  (changes  from  baseline  in  z-
score exceeding 0.5 would be judged a significant observation). In the 2-year long-term safety study 
PSZ-3002, the mean weight increase from open-label baseline to open-label endpoint was 4.7 kg ( n = 
400).  Overall,  47.0%  (73/157)  of  subjects  experienced  weight  gain  of  at  least  7.0%  at  open-label 
endpoint  relative  to  double-blind  baseline.  The  mean  change  in  z-score  was  0.1  for  both  weight  and 
BMI from open-label baseline to endpoint.  
The percentage change in body weight at endpoint relative to open-label baseline in Study PSZ-3002 is 
displayed in Figure 24.

2.5.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No death cases have been reported in studies with adolescents. 
PSZ-3001 
There were 5 treatment emergent SAEs that occurred ; 1 from the placebo group (psychotic disorder), 
2  from  the  paliperidone  ER  1.5  mg  group  (schizophrenia  and  agitation),  1  from  the  paliperidone  ER 
3mg group (Mallory Weiss syndrome) and 1 from the paliperidone ER 6mg group (schizophrenia). 
PSZ-3002 
SAEs  occurred  in  59  subjects  (14.8%).  Most  of  these  were  in  the  SOC  psychiatric  disorders  with  the 
most common being schizophrenia (n=30) indicating worsening of illness. Other SAEs that occurred in 
more than 1 subject were suicidal ideation (n=7) and agression and anxiety (in 4 subjects each). There 
were 3 suicide attempts; all in the paliperidone(NO/DB)paliperidone group.  
PSZ-3003 
There  were  6.2%  of  Treatment  Emergent  SAEs  in  the  paliperidone  ER  group  and  6.1%  in  the 
aripiprazole group. The most common was the SOC Psychiatric Disorders for both groups (5.3% each). 
2.5.4.  Laboratory, ECG and other findings 
No  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities  other  than  prolactin  levels  have  been  noted. 
Measurement of testosterone for assessing a potential long-term endocrine effect of elevated prolactin 
levels  did  not  point  towards  a  significant  change  in  testosterone  levels  in  male  adolescents  with 
schizophrenia.  Fasting  glucose  abnormalities  and  glucose-related  TEAEs  occasionally  occurred  with 
paliperidone  ER;  Homeostatic  Model  Assessment  (HOMA)  assessment  revealed  a  pre-existing  insulin 
resistance  at  baseline  in  all  studies  and  all  treatment  groups  and  beta  cell  function  was  similarly 
increased at  baseline. During treatment with paliperidone ER, the insulin resistance slightly increased 
and beta cell function slightly decreased, but not dose-related.  
Prolactin levels 
PSZ-3001 
Abnormally high prolactin values were found more frequently in the paliperidone ER groups compared 
to placebo and for more than half of the male patients and almost half of the female patients with no 
clear relation to dose (placebo: 10% male and 17% female). A clear dose effect could be established 
for females with mean increases of 10.39 ng/ml, 26.93 ng/ml, and 29.96 ng/ml for the 3mg, 6mg, and 
12mg  dose  group.  These  laboratory  abnormalities  did  not  generally  translate  into  prolactin-related 
adverse  events:  two  patients  from  the  paliperidone  ER  6mg  dose  group  were  reported  with 
galactorrhoea and one female patient from the paliperidone ER 3mg group with amenorrhoea.  
Higher incidences of treatment-emergent abnormal high prolactin results were observed in <15 years 
old subgroup than in ≥15 years old subgroup. It did not appear there was a dose-related trend in both 
age subgroups. 
PSZ-3003 
Abnormally  high  prolactin  values  could  be  shown  for  paliperidone  ER:  59%  of  males  and  57%  of 
females.  In  contrast,  aripiprazole-treated  patients  were  affected  to  a  smaller  extend  by  high  values 
due to its pharmacological properties (3% for males and 9% for females) but did show more decreases 
in prolactin (males: 52% and females: 29%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 77/87 
 
 
 
 
Again, there was no significant increase in TEAEs related to high prolactin values and only single cases 
were  reported  regarding  galactorrhoea,  gynaecomastia,  libido  decreased,  erectile  dysfunction, 
amenorrhoea, menstruation irregular. Except for one case of galactorrhoea, no TEAE showed up in the 
aripiprazole group.  
Higher incidences of treatment-emergent abnormal high prolactin results were observed in <15 years 
old than in ≥15 years old subgroup in paliperidone ER group, whereas higher incidences of treatment-
emergent  abnormal  low  prolactin  results  were  observed  in  <15  years  old  than  in  ≥15  years  old 
subgroup in aripiprazole group. 
PSZ-3002 
Incidences  of  treatment-emergent  abnormal  prolactin  results  by  sex  relative  to  baseline  (open-label 
and double-blind) were shown to be higher for males through all treatment groups.  
The mean prolactin levels for both males and females increased and reached a peak within the first 6 
months of treatment, and then either stabilized or gradually declined over time. 60% of male subjects 
and 48% of female subjects had elevated prolactin levels from open-label baseline to endpoint during 
this study. 9.3% subjects experienced a prolactin-related TEAE (18.5% in females and 3.3% in males). 
Higher  incidences  of  treatment-emergent  abnormal  high  prolactin  results  were  observed  in  the  <15 
years old than the ≥15 years old subgroup from double-blind baseline to endpoint. 
From  open-label  baseline  to  endpoint,  similar  incidences  of  treatment-emergent  abnormal  high 
prolactin  results  were  observed  for  male  subjects  regardless  of  age,  whereas  higher  incidences  were 
observed for female subjects who were <15 years old compared ≥15 years old. 
Electrocardiograms 
PSZ-3001 
Abnormally high heart rates occurred in greater percentages of subjects in the paliperidone ER dose 
groups than in the placebo group (1.5mg: 14%, 3mg: 33%, 6mg: 5%, 12mg: 18% vs. placebo: 4%). 
Tachycardia-related events occurred in 4.7% of the total paliperidone group and in no patient from 
placebo.  
All subjects in each dose group had normal average pre-dose and maximum post-dose values for 
QTcF. No subject had a maximum post-dose value >480msec. Most subjects had increases in QTc 
values from average pre-dose to maximum post-dose of <30 ms. No subject in any dose group had an 
increase that was greater than 60 msec. 
PSZ-3003 
Abnormally high heart rate was observed in more subjects in the paliperidone ER group (8 subjects, 
8%) compared to the aripiprazole group (6 subjects, 6%). There were no clinically relevant mean or 
median changes in heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, RR interval, QTcB, QTcF, QTlc, or 
QTcLD. TEAEs of tachycardia were reported with a higher incidence in the paliperidone ER group 
compared to aripiprazole (2.7% vs. 1.8%). One TEAE of sinus tachycardia was reported from the 
paliperidone ER group only. Most subjects in the paliperidone ER and aripiprazole group had a 
maximum increase of QTcF of 30msec and less (94% and 97%). 6% of subjects from the paliperidone 
ER group and 2% of subjects from the aripiprazole group had QTcF changes of 30 to 60msec. One 
subject on aripiprazole had a QTcF change of more than 60msec. 
PSZ-3002 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 78/87 
 
 
 
 
Abnormally  high  heart  rate  was  reported  for  13%  of  total  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects.  One 
subject had a TEAE related to cardiac arrhythmias (sinus bradycardia). Two subjects had TEAEs related 
to proarrhythmic potential; one subject each had a TEAE of seizure and syncope.  
With respect to QTcF changes from open-label baseline to endpoint, 88% of the total paliperidone ER 
group had changes of 30msec or less. 5% of subjects from the placebo/ paliperidone group, 8% from 
the paliperidone (DB)/ paliperidone group, and 14% from the paliperidone (No DB)/ paliperidone group 
had QTcF changes of >30 to 60msec. A total of three patients had QTcF changes of more than 60msec.  
Tanner staging 
PSZ-3001 
Most  male  and  female  subjects  had  the  same  Tanner  ratings  at  endpoint  as  at  baseline  in  each 
treatment  group.  No  significant  differences  have  been  found  between  paliperidone  ER  groups  and 
placebo. 
PSZ-3002  
Most  male  and  female  subjects  had  the  same  Tanner  ratings  at  endpoint  as  at  open-label  baseline 
(ratings  were  predominantly  4  and  5  indicating  a  mostly  post-pubertal  population).  Adolescents  aged 
12 to 13 years showed an expected shift from lower to higher Tanner ratings during the 2-year study. 
2.5.5.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The  most  common  adverse  events  leading  to  discontinuation  across  the  3  Phase  III  studies  were 
adverse events coded to the Nervous System Disorders and Psychiatric Disorders SOCs. Other events 
led  to  withdrawal  infrequently  and  showed  no  pattern  related  to  treatment  or  to  the  dose  of 
paliperidone ER. 
Treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs occurred at low rates in subjects treated with paliperidone ER 
in all Phase 3 studies (in study PSZ-3001, 2%; in study PSZ-3003, 4.4%; in the 2-year study PSZ-
3002, 6.3%).The incidences of TEAEs that resulted in discontinuation of treatment were also low in 
adults who received paliperidone ER (≤7% in double-blind and open-label studies) and adolescents 
who received risperidone (≤9% in double-blind and open-label studies). 
PSZ-3001 
One  patient  each  discontinued  due  to  an  adverse  event  from  the  paliperidone  ER  1.5  mg  (dermatitis 
allergic), 3mg (Mallory-Weiss Syndrome) and 12mg group (Dystonia), no patient from the placebo and 
the paliperidone ER 6 mg group.  
PSZ-3003 
Five  patients  from  the  paliperidone  ER  group  and  no  patient  from  the  aripiprazole  treatment  had  a 
TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation. Four of these patients (3.5%) discontinued during the acute 
phase (through Day 56) of the study. The respective adverse events did not reveal a specific pattern 
(Oculogyric crisis, Lethargy, Anxiety, Galactorrhoea, and Rash).  
PSZ-3002 
Twenty-five  patients  (6.3%)  discontinued  due  to  TEAEs  with  the  highest  number  in  the  paliperidone 
(No  DB)/paliperidone  group  amounting  to  23  patients.  Three  of  these  23  patients  discontinued 
subsequently to a suicide attempt and two due to suicidal ideation. Three patients discontinued due to 
Akathisia. All other TEAE-related treatment discontinuations happened in single subjects only.

2.5.6.  Post marketing experience 
A  cumulative  review  was  performed  by  the  MAH  (cut-off  date:  11  September  2012)  to  provide  an 
overall safety information about paliperidone in this patient population. All spontaneous cases reported 
with paliperidone or paliperidone palmitate, were compared by age group (<18 years versus all other 
age groups, ie, those patients ≥18 years of age) using a measure of disproportionality. Preferred terms 
(PTs)  of  interest  were  identified  if  disproportionality  (ie,  higher  proportion  of  total  events  among 
paediatric patients than all other age groups) was present in the cumulative data. 
There were 360 cases involving paediatric patients (<18 years) received during the cumulative review 
period,  of  which  40%  were  serious.  The  patterns  of  disproportionately  reported  ADRs  with  Preferred 
Terms (PTs) observed were generally consistent with adult clinical trials and post-marketing experience 
or were specific to the paediatric population.  
The  PTs  that  demonstrated  disproportionality  vs  adults  were  as  follows:  Accidental  overdose;  Breast 
discharge;  Dystonia;  Gynaecomastia;  Increased  appetite;  Oculogyric  crisis;  Somnolence;  Suicidal 
ideation;  Lethargy;  Increased  appetite;  Trismus;  Breast  enlargement;  Swollen  tongue;  Chest  pain; 
Irritability;  Medication  residue;  Sluggishness;  Therapeutic  response  unexpected;  Muscle  twitching; 
Convulsion; Disturbance  in  attention;  Drooling;  Hypersomnia;  Restless  legs  syndrome;  Tic;  Abnormal 
behaviour; Aggression; Anger; Catatonia; Priapism; Swelling face; and Urticaria.  
There  were  no  fatal  cases  reported  in  paediatric  patients  treated  with  paliperidone  during  the 
cumulative  review  period. No  disproportionality  of  reporting  was  noted  for  paediatric  patients  when 
compared  to  all  other  age  groups  during  this  review  with  respect  to  any  of  the  predefined  areas  of 
clinical interest, including the collective group of all extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, prolactin-
related events, glucose metabolism disorders, cardiac events, suicidality, or sedation. 
Adverse  events  reported  in  association  with  the  predefined  areas  of  clinical  interest  were  consistent 
with the known safety profile for paliperidone ER and paliperidone palmitate and included EPS-related 
events,  isolated  cases  of  excessive  weight  gain,  and  prolactin-related  events.  PTs  such  as  Accidental 
drug  intake  by  child  and  Drug  administered  to  patient  of  inappropriate  age  would  not  be  reported  in 
the adult population.  
The disproportionate reporting of off-label use may be reflective of the limited indicated age range of 
paliperidone  ER  (schizophrenia  in  adolescents  aged  12  to  17  years)  and  paliperidone  palmitate  (not 
indicated in children or adolescents) per the CCDS and the off label use for disorders found mostly in 
children (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism). 
2.5.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical development program for Paliperidone ER in adolescents included 3 phase III studies and 
one phase one study which included 653 subjects exposed to paliperidone ER. The number of patients 
for  whom  safety  data  is  available  seems  adequate.  No  particular  safety  issues  have  been  identified 
during  the  clinical  development  program.    The  type  of  adverse  events  reported  in  545  adolescent 
subjects  with  schizophrenia  receiving  once-daily  treatment  with  paliperidone  ER  in  the  3  studies 
included in this submission were generally consistent with those reported for paliperidone ER in adult 
subjects and those known to be associated with risperidone treatment in adolescent subjects.  
However, patients aged 12 to 14 years represented a minority across the three phase 3 studies 3001, 
3003, and 3002. For example, dose range evaluation of TEAEs in study 3001 relied on a maximum of 
16 patients aged 12 to 14 years in each treatment group. Similarly and with regard to clinical efficacy 
data, there are few safety data for patients weighing less than 51 kg compared to those weighing more 
than 51 kg. Whist further data were provided to support an individual dose titration depending on body

weight,  the CHMP was still of the opinion that  a positive benefit-risk  in the younger age group 12 to 
14 years was insufficiently demonstrated due to the lack of data. 
Following ADR analyses on all data from the adolescent studies, the MAH identified the following new 
ADRs  that  had  previously  not  been  identified  in  the  use  in  adults:  Bundle  branch  block  right,  Eye 
movement  disorder,  Alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  Aspartate  aminotransferase  increased, 
Nuchal  rigidity,  Muscle  contractions  involuntary,  Opisthotonus,  Speech  disorder,  Tongue  paralysis, 
Insomnia, Anxiety, Epistaxis, and hypertension. These have been added to the current paliperidone ER 
CCDS.  In  addition,  “weight  circumference  increased”  was  also  identified  and  is  considered  related  to 
“weight  increase”  which  is  already  listed  in  the  SmPC.  Similarly  to  the  adult  population,  the  highest 
incidence  of  TEAEs  emerged  from  the  Nervous  System  Disorders  SOC.  Dose-related  trends  were 
observed for Somnolence, Akathisia, Tremor, Dystonia, and Cogwheel rigidity. 
Compared to paliperidone ER in adults, the frequency of EPS-related adverse events was clearly higher 
for  adolescents  in  studies  PSZ-3001,  -3003,  and  -3002  (around  36.5%  of  subjects  affected  during 
open-label treatment). This finding is confirmed by the high concomitant use of anticholinergics (up to 
one-third  of  patients).  EPS  symptoms  were  highest  during  the  first  three  months  of  treatment  and 
reaching a plateau from six months of treatment up to 24 months. The CHMP however noted that the 
incidences of EPS related events observed in the open label study were in the range of that reported 
for other antipsychotics. In addition, there was no evidence of a dose effect with regard to either the 
incidences  of  treatment-emergent  EPS  as  assessed  by  the  results  of  the  EPS  scales  or  in  the  rate  of 
anticholinergic  medication  use  in  the  Paliperidone  ER  Total  group.  There  were  also  no  apparent 
differences  in  treatment-emergent  EPS-related  AEs  by  rating  scales  and  use  of  anticholinergic 
medications with regard to age or weight. The CHMP concluded that a general SmPC warning related to 
regular examination of EPS symptoms for the paediatric population should be included. 
Potentially clinically significant weight gain of 7% and more was reported for 26% of patients in study 
PSZ-3003 and for 47% in study PSZ-3002, reflecting a high risk of weight gain associated with various 
comorbidities,  particularly  in  a  schizophrenic  population.  This  risk  is  clearly  more  pronounced  with 
higher  doses.  Post-marketing  data  from  adolescents  in  the  US  did  not  indicate  a  difference  in  weight 
increase reporting compared to adults. During the course of treatment in Phase 3 studies, there were 
no clinically significant mean changes in z-scores (adjusted for sex- and age-specific normative values) 
for  weight  or  BMI.  In  the  2-year  long-term  study,  the  majority  of  subjects  had  z-scores  below  the 
clinically significant threshold of 0.5 in all categories. Subgroup analyses did not reveal apparent trends 
of  weight  gain  related  AEs  with  regard  to  age  or  body  weight.  The  CHMP  however  recommended  to 
include information related to weight gain as warning in the SmPC. 
No  clinically  relevant  changes  in  laboratory  parameters  were  noted  during  short  and  long-term 
treatment  with  paliperidone  ER  in  adolescents  with  schizophrenia  except  for  serum  prolactin.  In 
addition,  pre-existing  insulin  resistance  was  found in  all  treatment  groups  and  slightly increased  over 
time, whereas the compensatory increase in beta cell functioning slightly decreased.  
Elevation  in  serum  prolactin  has  been  noted  across  all  paliperidone  ER  treatment  groups  clearly 
increased  by  dose,  whereas  females  were  more  affected  than  males.  However,  abnormalities  did  not 
simultaneously  lead  to  TEAEs  with  regard  to  prolactin.  The  highest  rate  was  observed  in  study  3002 
with near 10% of all paliperidone ER-treated subjects. Serum prolactin was highest during the first six 
months  of  treatment  and  remained  stable  thereafter.Higher  incidences  of  treatment-emergent 
abnormal  prolactin  results  were  observed  in  younger  (<15  years)  subjects  than  in  older  (≥15  years) 
subjects across all studies with adolescents. There were no corresponding increased incidences in AEs 
in  the  subgroups  with  younger  subjects.Prolactin  increases  appeared  to  be  in  line  with  those  from 
paliperidone  ER  in  adults  and  with  risperidone  in  adolescents.  Because  of  the  potential  effects  of 
Assessment report

prolonged  hyperprolactinemia  on  growth  and  sexual  maturation,  a  SmPC  warning  related  to  regular 
clinical  evaluation  of  endocrinological  status  for  the  paediatric  population  was  recommended  by  the 
CHMP. 
Increase  in  blood  triglycerides  was  common  in  open  label  study  3002  and  the  frequency  was  more 
commonly  observed  in  adolescents  than  in  adults.  However,  treatment  with  paliperidone  ER  did  not 
appear to alter blood triglyceride profile and triglyceride related AEs are not common. The increase in 
mean triglyceride levels in PSZ-3003 was not replicated in the longer and larger study PSZ-3002. The 
ADR rate of hypertriglyceridemia is higher in the pediatric population than the adult population.  
A dose relationship was observed for somnolence, subgroup analyses by age and weight groups did not 
reveal  a  higher  incidence  of  somnolence  related  AEs  in  the  younger  and  lighter  patients  (<15  years 
and <51 kg). However, somnolence was found to be higher in adolescents compared to adults, dose-
related (6 to 26%) and higher compared to placebo and also detected in 23% of patients during long-
term  treatment.  Consequently,  a  SmPC  warning  related  to  close  monitoring  for  sedative  effect  of 
paliperidone ER for the paediatric population was recommended by the CHMP. 
No death cases have been reported during studies with adolescents. The overall number of serious 
adverse events was low, similar for paliperidone ER, placebo and active comparator, and most of all 
related to the underlying psychiatric illness.  
ECG  changes  in  adolescents  were  found  to  be  in  line  with  those  in  adults,  e.g.  the  potential  of 
paliperidone ER to increase heart rate (≥ 100 bpm). There were no clinically relevant mean or median 
changes  in  PR  interval,  QRS  interval,  QT  interval,  RR  interval,  or  corrected  QT  intervals  in  subjects 
treated with paliperidone ER in any of the Phase 3 studies. 
No  retardation  in  growth  as  represented  by  changes  in  height,  weight,  and  BMI  based  on  Z-score 
analyses,  as  well  as  in  sexual  maturation  (Tanner  staging)  was  noted,  which  would  indicate  an 
abnormal adolescent maturation. 
Based on post-marketing data, there were 360 cases involving paediatric patients (<18 years) during 
the cumulative review period, of which 40% were serious. The patterns of disproportionately reported 
ADRs with Preferred Terms (PTs) observed were generally consistent with adult clinical trials and post-
marketing experience or were specific to the paediatric population.  
2.5.8.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the CHMP concluded that the safety of Invega for the treatment of schizophrenia in 15 years 
and  older  has  been  sufficiently  characterised.  From  the  safety  database  all  the  adverse  reactions 
reported in paediatric clinical trials have been included in the SmPC.  
2.5.9.  PSUR cycle 
Having considered the data submitted in the application and following the MAH proposal to restrict the 
proposed indication to treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 15 years and older, the CHMP was of 
the opinion that the PSUR cycle for paliperidone should remain unchanged.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
2.6.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 82/87 
 
 
 
 
PRAC Advice 
The  MAH  has  submitted  an  updated  RMP  (version  4.0)  in  which  the  results  from  studies  including 
adolescent  patient  with  schizophrenia  have  been  added.  However,  no  new  safety  issues  have  been 
proposed  and  therefore  the  pharmacovigilance  and  risk  minimisation  plans  are  unchanged.  This  is 
acceptable. 
Additionally, the MAH has removed the safety issue “Neonatal withdrawal Syndrome” and “Antiemetic 
Effect” in accordance with the PRAC opinion during the recent PSUR assessment. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
Following  the  MAH  proposal  to  restrict  the  proposed  indication  to  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in 
adolescents 15 years and older, updates of the RMP were proposed with regard to module SIII.2 and 
SVII.3. In addition, changes in line with the latest PRAC recommendation on the PSUR (January 2014) 
were  made.  These  changes  were  agreed  by  the  CHMP  and  RMP  (version  5.1)  was  considered 
acceptable. 
2.7.  Update of the product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC 
have  been  updated  to  include  efficacy  and  safety  information  resulting  from  the  submitted  paediatric 
studies. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. The SmPC changes are summarised below: 
Final recommended indication, posology and warnings are as follows: 
Section 4.1 
INVEGA is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 15 years and older. 
Section 4.2 
Paediatric population 
Schizophrenia:  The  recommended  starting  dose  of  INVEGA  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in 
adolescents 15 years and older is 3 mg once daily, administered in the morning.  
Adolescents weighing < 51 kg: the maximum recommended daily dose of INVEGA is 6 mg. 
Adolescents weighing ≥ 51 kg: the maximum recommended daily dose of INVEGA is 12 mg. 
Dosage adjustment, if indicated, should occur only after clinical reassessment based on the individual 
need of the patient. When dose increases are indicated, increments of 3 mg/day are recommended and 
generally  should  occur  at  intervals  of  5  days  or  more.  The  safety  and  efficacy  of  INVEGA  in  the 
treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adolescents  between  12  and  14  years  old  has  not  been  established. 
Currently  available  data  are  described  in  section  4.8  and  5.1  but  no  recommendation  on  a  posology 
can be made. There is no relevant use of INVEGA in children aged less than 12 years. 
Section 4.4 
Paediatric population 
The sedative effect of INVEGA should be closely monitored in this population. A change in the time of 
administration of INVEGA may improve the impact of sedation on the patient. 
Because of the potential effects of prolonged hyperprolactinemia on growth and sexual maturation in 
adolescents, regular clinical evaluation of endocrinological status should be considered, including 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 83/87 
 
 
 
 
 
measurements of height, weight, sexual maturation, monitoring of menstrual functioning, and other 
potential prolactin-related effects. 
During treatment with INVEGA regular examination for extrapyramidal symptoms and other movement 
disorders should also be conducted. 
For specific posology recommendations in the paediatric population see section 4.2. 
In addition: 
- A summary of safety profile related to the paediatric population was also added to section 4.8, listing 
ADRs  that  were  reported  more  frequently  in  adolescents  than  in  adults  receiving  Invega  (and  more 
frequently  than  placebo).  Furthermore,  the  list  of  adult  ADRs  in  the  “Summary  of  safety  profile” 
subsection  of  SmPC  section  4.8  has  been  updated  as  a  result  of  changes  in  frequency  calculations 
resulting  from  the  removal  of  the  paediatric  study  PSZ-3001  when  calculating  ADR  reporting 
frequency. In this subsection, the identification of those ADRs that are ‘most frequently reported’ were 
based  on  a  cut-off  of  >  2%  from  the  original  analysis  and  led  to  the  addition  of  cough  (a  common 
ADR). In addition, the tabulated list of adverse reactions considered all ADRs reported in clinical trials 
and  post-marketing  experience  with  paliperidone  with  a  frequency  category  estimated  from  the  adult 
trials  and  thus  resulted  in  change  in  frequencies  for  some  of  the  listed  adverse  reactions  (e.g  white 
blodd cell count decreased, thrombocytopenia, hyperprolactinemia, tardive dyskinesia, atrioventricular 
block, eczema); 
-  Sections  5.1  and  5.3  were  updated  to  add  the  main  results  from  the  paediatric  clinical  studies  and 
juvenile toxicity studies, respectively;  
- Section 5.2 was updated to reflect the main findings from the pharmacokinetic modelling analyses.; 
- Section 4.5 was updated to include a statement that “interaction studies have only been performed in 
adults”. 
No  full  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package  leaflet  been  performed  and  no 
bridging  report  was  submitted  making  reference  to  the  assessment  of  the  initial  patient  leaflet  for 
INVEGA prolonged release tablets, that was approved on 25 June 2007. The MAH states that since no 
additional safety issues have been identified and no new route of administration is proposed, there is 
no need for a user testing. The justification submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet has been revised to amend contact 
details for the representatives of Luxembourg and Belgium. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Beneficial effects 
In  study  PSZ-3001,  results  indicated  that  the  study  achieved  its  primary  objective  by  demonstrating 
that  at  least  one  paliperidone  ER  weight-based  group  (<51  Kg:  3  mg/day;  ≥51  Kg:  6  mg/day)  was 
statistically  superior  to  placebo  in  improving  the  symptoms  of  schizophrenia  as  measured  by  the 
change  in  PANSS  total  score  from  baseline  to  endpoint  (week  6,  difference  of  LS  means:  -10.1; 
p=0.006). Efficacy analyses of the secondary endpoints including CGI-S, CGAS, sleep VAS and PANSS 
factor scores were consistent with the findings of the primary efficacy analysis.  
Similarly  to  the  overall  study  results  for  this  short  term  trial,  the  medium  dose  group  (<51  Kg:  3 
mg/day;  ≥51  Kg:  6  mg/day)  showed  better  improvement  in  PANSS  total  score  in  all  analysed 
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 84/87 
 
 
 
 
 
subgroups  based  on  age  and/or  weight.  In  patients  aged  15-17  years  old,  statistically  significant 
differences versus placebo were observed in both the Medium (<51 Kg: 3 mg/day; ≥51 Kg: 6 mg/day, 
p=0.005) and High (<51 Kg: 6 mg/day; ≥51 Kg: 12 mg/day, p=0.012) dose groups of paliperidone ER 
for  the  primary  endpoint  (change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  PANSS  total  score).  In  addition, 
consistent  efficacy  findings  were  observed  for  the  subgroup  analyses  on  the  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints  
In study PSZ-3003, maintenance data was provided over 26 weeks. The primary objective was not met 
i.e.  paliperidone  ER  did  not  demonstrate  superior  efficacy  compared  to  aripiprazole.  However,  robust 
and  clinically  meaningful reductions  in  mean  PANSS  total  score  from  baseline  to  endpoint  acute  (Day 
56,  LOCF)  in  the  paliperidone  ER  (-19.3)  and  aripiprazole  (-19.8)  groups  were  observed.  Similar 
treatment  effects  with  regard  to  decreasing  the  PANSS  total  scores  over  the  26-week  period  for 
paliperidone ER and aripiprazole were also noted.  
In  study  PSZ-3002,  improvement  in  the  PANSS  total  scores  in  patients  treated  with  paliperidone  ER 
were  observed  during  the  first  3  months  of  the  open-label  treatment.  The  improvements  in  PANSS 
total scores observed during the first 3 months were maintained during the remaining portion of this 2 
year  study.  Subgroup  analyses  based  on  age  and  weight  did  not  reveal  any  significant  difference  in 
improvement in PANSS during the course of 2 year treatment. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The time course of PANSS score and the influence of exposure to paliperidone and other covariates has 
not been evaluated by modelling as compared to the presented popPK analysis. This makes it difficult 
to draw any conclusion about the relation between paliperidone exposure and clinical effect. 
Although  post-hoc  analyses  by  actual  dose  received  by  the  subjects  showed  statistically  significant 
improvement  relative  to  placebo  in  the  PANSS  total  scores  at  endpoint  for  the  paliperidone  ER  3,  6, 
and 12 mg dose groups, no clear dose response pattern was observed for the efficacy parameters. 
The  proportion  of  patients  aged  12-14  years  was  relatively  small  to  conclude  on  the  efficacy  (short 
term and maintenance of the effect) in this population. In both short term and long term studies, the 
effect on the PANSS total score was also considered weaker in this age group as compared to patients 
aged  15-17  years.  In  study  PSZ-3001,  the  difference  of  LS  mean  changes  from  baseline  to  endpoint 
was -15.5 in patients aged 12-14 years and -18.1 in patients aged 15-17 years, respectively. In study 
PSZ-3003,  the  difference  of  LS  mean  changes  from  baseline  to  endpoint  was  -17.5  in  patients  aged 
12-14  years  and  -20.1  in  patients  aged  15-17  years,  respectively.  In  study  PSZ-3002  (open  label), 
among  younger  adolescents  a  lower  percentage  of  subjects  who  maintained  a  30%  PANSS  response 
over time was observed compared to patients in 15-17 years.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Identified  risks  did  not  differ  by  nature  between  the  adult  and  adolescent  population  but  in  terms  of 
frequencies  of  EPS  symptoms,  weight  gain,  somnolence/sedation,  triglycerides  level  and  a  slightly 
higher rate of suicidality-related events. 
Weight  increases  have  occurred  at  higher  incidence  in  younger  adolescents  compared  to  older 
adolescents. 
Somnolence was  found  to  be  higher in  adolescents  compared  to  adults,  dose-related  (6  to  26%)  and 
higher compared to placebo (4%) and also detected in 23% of patients during long-term treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/339041/2014  
Page 85/87 
 
 
 
 
A clear dose-response pattern was observed for several safety parameters including common adverse 
events  (somnolence,  akathisia,  tremor,  and  dystonia),  EPS  related  adverse  events  (hyperkinesia, 
dystonia, and tremor) and associated use of anticholinergic medications, and mean increases in body 
weight  and  BMI.  In  addition,  elevation  in  serum  prolactin  has  been  noted  across  all  paliperidone  ER 
treatment groups and was clearly increased by dose. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are limited data on the long term safety of paliperidone in the paediatric population, especially in 
patients aged 12-14 years. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Paliperidone  (Invega)  is  an  oral  prolonged-release  formulation,  and  do  not  require  dose  titration  at 
initiation  treatment.  The  clinical  programme  was  part  of  an  agreed  PIP.  Currently,  authorised 
antipsychotics  are  limited  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  the  paediatric  population.  There  is 
therefore  a  need  for  evidence-based  therapeutic  options  in  this  patient  population.  The  efficacy  of 
paliperidone  ER  was  demonstrated  over  placebo  in  adolescent  patients  with  schizophrenia  at  week  6, 
for the medium dose group only. The proportion of patients aged 12-14 years was relatively small to 
conclude on the efficacy (short term and maintenance of effect) in this population. In patients aged 15-
17  years  old,  statistically  significant  differences  versus  placebo  were  observed  in  both  the  Medium 
(p=0.005) and High (p=0.012) dose groups of paliperidone ER for the primary endpoint at week 6. In 
addition,  consistent  efficacy  findings  were  observed  for  the  subgroup  analyses  on  the  secondary 
efficacy endpoints. Although the maintenance study did not meet its primary objective ie paliperidone 
ER  did  not  demonstrate  superior  efficacy  compared  to  aripiprazole,  robust  and  clinically  meaningful 
reductions  in  mean  PANSS  total  score  were  observed  for  both  paliperidone  ER  and  aripiprazole  and 
were numerically similar.  
In the studied paediatric population, the overall safety profile appeared similar to that seen in adults..  
Following the CHMP concerns over the lack of sufficient evidence of short term and long term efficacy 
in  subjects  aged  between  12-14  years,  the  MAH  proposed  to  restrict  the  proposed  indication  to 
treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 15 years and older. According to the Schizophrenia Guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/40072/2010  Rev.1),  data  on  maintenance  of  effect  may  be  extrapolated  from  adults  to 
adolescents  as  of  the  age  of  15  years.  Furthermore,  considering  individual  dose  strategy  was 
supported  by  PK/PD  data  (including  weight  based  dosing  recommendation)  and  that    the 
pharmacokinetic profile is expected to be similar between adolescents (15 years and older) and adults, 
the  CHMP  considered  that  the  efficacy  was  established  in  patients  over  15  years  and  older  at  a 
recommended starting dose of 3 mg. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Considering  the  efficacy  and  safety  data  across  paediatric  age  groups  from  12-17  years,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  limited  data  were  available  to  conclude  on  a  positive  benefit-risk  balance  of 
paliperidone  ER  in  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  patients  aged  12-14  years  old.  In  contrast,  the 
efficacy and safety in the older paediatric population (15-17 years) have been sufficiently established. 
Therefore,  in  agreement  with  the  MAH,  the  CHMP  concluded  on  a  positive  benefit-risk  balance  in  the 
following indication: 
“INVEGA is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 15 years and older.”

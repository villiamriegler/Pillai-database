2.  Scientific discussion 
About the product 
Zirabev (PF-06439535) is a recombinant humanised immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody 
(mAb). PF-06439535 is composed of 2 heavy chains (gamma 1) and 2 light chains (kappa), linked by disulfide 
bonds and has the same primary amino acid sequence as bevacizumab-EU. PF-06439535 is produced by 
recombinant technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application concerns a centralised procedure for marketing authorisation of Zirabev (PF-06439535) 
bevacizumab concentrate for solution for infusion for intravenous administration of 25 mg/mL, as a biosimilar 
product to the European reference product Avastin (EU/1/04/300/001-002). 
The development programme is in general compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice. 
Non-clinical 
In a formal scientific advice from 2015, the CHMP agreed that the proposed preclinical and pharmacological 
similarity approach seemed to be sufficient to evaluate preclinical and pharmacological similarity of the 
biosimilar compared to the reference product, and adequate to permit submission and review of a Bevacizumab 
(PF-06439535) MAA for Zirabev as a proposed biosimilar to Avastin. 
The two studies performed in animals were conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
Regulations.

2.1.  Quality aspects 
2.1.1.  Introduction 
Zirabev is presented as a similar biological application to the reference medicinal product Avastin.   
The finished product (FP) is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion containing 25 mg/ml of 
bevacizumab as active substance (AS).  
Other ingredients are sucrose, succinic acid, disodium edetate, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide (for pH 
adjustment) and water for injections. 
The product is available as a 4 ml or 16 ml solution in a vial (Type I glass) with a stopper (butyl rubber) 
containing 100 mg of bevacizumab or 400 mg of bevacizumab, respectively. The finished product comes in a 
pack size of 1 vial. 
Prior to administration the concentrate for solution for infusion should be diluted to the required administration 
volume with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to a concentration of the final bevacizumab 
solution between 1.4 mg/ml to 16.5 mg/ml. 
2.1.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Bevacizumab (also referred to as PF-06439535 by the Applicant) is a humanised IgG1κ mAb with two identical 
heavy chains (HC) and two identical light chains (LC), covalently linked with four inter-chain disulphide bonds. 
The monoclonal antibody (mAb) is produced in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line, the same cell line used 
for manufacturing of the reference product Avastin. The confirmed amino acid sequence, the molecular mass 
(theoretical and experimental) for the deglycosylated molecule and experimental molecular mass including 
glycosylation, the molecular formula of the light and heavy chains of PF-06439535 number of cysteines, the 
number of intra and inter disulphide bonds and the general properties are provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/97237/2019 
Page 9/86 
  
  
The N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence in the CH2 region is essentially fully occupied with asialo, 
core-fucosylated, complex-type biantennary oligosaccharides, predominately with structures containing zero 
and one terminal galactose residues. The molecular mass is approximately 149 kilodaltons (kDa).  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Bevacizumab active substance (AS) is manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) 
at Wyeth BioPharma Division, One Burtt Road, Andover, MA 01810, USA. The site is covered by a valid GMP 
certificate. 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the AS has been well described by the Applicant.  
The manufacturing process for PF-06439535 active substance uses a recombinant CHO cell line. Cells are grown 
in suspension culture using chemically-defined (CD), animal-derived component-free (ACF) media. The main 
steps of the manufacturing process are cell culture, recovery and purification. The process begins with the 
thawing of cells from the working cell bank (WCB) followed by expansion. The purification of PF-06439535 
comprises several chromatography steps and orthogonal dedicated virus clearance steps.  
The cell culture process starts with the thawing of a working cell bank (WCB) vial which is progressively 
expanded. During culture expansion and maintenance critical process parameters and critical material attributes 
are identified and justified with acceptable ranges (alert and termination limits). Inoculum culture from a seed 
bioreactor is added to production medium in the production bioreactor to a pre-defined target seed density. The 
production bioreactor culture is harvested and clarified by centrifugation and depth filtration to remove cells and 
debris. After this harvest step, the product is purified by an affinity chromatography step, a virus inactivation 
step, and ion exchange chromatography steps.  The product is then processed through a virus retaining filter 
(VRF) followed by concentration and solution exchange in an ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) step. Lastly, the 
excipients are added to the product to achieve the final formulation of active substance, followed by final 
filtration and freezing. 
The process controls include a combination of critical process parameters (CPP), non-critical process parameters 
(non-CPP), critical material attributes (CMA), and in-process tests. The filtered PF-06439535 active substance is 
filled into a suitable container closure system, labelled, frozen, and shipped frozen to the finished product 
manufacturing site. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials are sufficiently described and controlled.  
With the exception of CloneDetect (Human IgG (H+L) Specific, Fluorescein-conjugated) derived from sheep and 
used in the development of the recombinant cell line, no materials of animal or human origin are used during the 
production of the active substance.  
The fermentation growth medium is a proprietary dry powder medium.  It is a protein-free, chemically-defined 
medium and contains no proteins or peptide components of animal or plant origin and no undefined lysates or 
hydrolysates. 
The details regarding the origin of materials, pharmacopoeial reference or internal specification, and the stage 
of the manufacturing process, where the material is used, are provided.

Details on the coding sequence and generation of the expression vector to code for bevacizumab amino acid 
sequence have been provided and are consistent with Pfizer-generated mass spectrometry and biochemical data 
for the reference product bevacizumab-US and bevacizumab-EU.  
A two-tiered cell banking system, consisting of a master cell bank (MCB) and a working cell bank (WCB), was 
established for commercial production. The MCB and WCB were characterised according to ICH requirements, 
e.g. Q5A (R1), Q5B and Q5D. The adventitious agents assays test results indicate that the cell bank is sterile and 
free of detectable mycoplasma and viruses. During routine production, cell culture age is controlled to less than 
the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA). The provided data support the proposed PF-06439535 LIVCA. The LIVCA is 
supported by several assays demonstrating phenotypic and genotypic stability. Data have been provided to 
indicate that the cell line is robust with respect to critical parameters. MCB and WCB stability under the defined 
storage conditions will be monitored.  All newly prepared WCBs will also be manufactured in accordance with a 
pre-specified protocol and cGMP guideline and qualified, complying with ICH Q5D and Q5A (R1). The protocol for 
establishment of a new WCB is provided. If the protocol to establish a new WCB differs from the current protocol, 
a variation procedure shall be submitted.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The Applicant has presented critical and non-critical quality attributes (QAs) of bevacizumab, their relevance to 
the similarity assessment, and the justification for the criticality and similarity assignment. For QAs that have 
been ranked as CQAs, most are controlled through release and stability testing. The in-process controls 
including process parameters and material attributes with ranges and in-process tests with control limits have 
also been provided.  
The PF-06439535 manufacturing process is built upon the Applicant’s CHO cell-derived mAb platform process. 
Principles outlined in ICH Q8-ICH Q11 are applied. The control strategy was defined using a holistic approach. 
The understanding of the PF-06439535 manufacturing process has been obtained by performing 
manufacturing-scale runs and process characterisation studies, including design of experiments (DOE) studies, 
and by using scale-down models of individual unit operations. In alignment with ICH Q10, quality systems are 
in place to support continuous quality/process verification and change management post approval. 
Process validation 
The validation of the PF-06439535 active substance manufacturing process included three process performance 
qualification (PPQ) batches from three independent consecutive thaws of the WCB. Process parameters (inputs) 
were maintained within pre-defined limits. The process validation was demonstrated by meeting 
pre-determined acceptance criteria for product quality and performance parameters.  
Process validation was conducted on a number of consecutive batches from consecutive thaws of the WCB. 
Manufacturing-scale runs and process characterisation studies were performed, which include DOE studies using 
scale-down models of individual unit operations representative of the commercial process and univariate and 
multivariate experiments.  
All process validation batches met acceptance criteria and conform to the commercial specifications. In addition, 
process parameter and in-process test data from the process validation campaign are within committed control 
limits for the commercial process. Process validation results demonstrate control, effectiveness and consistency 
of the AS manufacturing process. 
The final container closure system has been appropriately validated. The two sizes of container were considered 
during the process validation studies and process manufacture development studies. Container integrity is 
confirmed visually at the time of use.

Manufacturing process development 
Only minor modifications were made during the process development history, and all batches used for 
nonclinical and clinical studies were manufactured at the intended commercial launch site using the intended 
commercial process. Some process parameters were tightened as the program progressed to process validation 
to optimize process performance and consistency, while remaining within prior established target ranges. 
Overall, the process changes have no significant impact on process performance or product. 
In order to reduce the sparger clogging, which was observed during the development phase of the process a 
different sparger configuration and a new impeller configuration was used thereafter. 
Characterisation 
All characterisation and elucidation studies were conducted on PF-06439535 manufactured by the commercial 
manufacturing process. The analytical techniques and methodologies applied to the characterisation of 
PF-06439535 are capable of evaluating primary structure, molecular mass, posttranslational modifications, 
charge and size heterogeneity, extinction coefficient, higher order structure, aggregation and fragmentation, 
biological activity and degradation pathways. The results demonstrated that PF-06439535 has the expected 
structure and functional properties. 
Specification 
Adequate active substance specifications have been provided. The list of test parameters for the active 
substance specification includes tests of identity, purity and impurities, potency and other general tests. The 
acceptance criteria are applicable to batch release and end of shelf-life unless specified. 
In-house method numbers for the analytical procedures used for active substance release are specified in the 
dossier. Stated impurities have been studied in non-clinical studies. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used for active substance testing have been described in detail. The majority of 
analytical procedures are common to both AS and FP. Compendial analytical procedures used for batch release 
and stability studies are clarity, coloration, pH, bioburden and endotoxin. Non-compendial analytical procedures 
used for batch release and stability studies were demonstrated to be suitable for the intended use. 
The validation of the analytical methods was described in detail. The results are deemed sufficient and 
acceptable and the methods are considered appropriately validated. 
Batch analysis 
Batch data from several PF-06439535 active substance batches which demonstrate that manufacturing 
generates a consistent active substance have been provided.  All batches comply with the commercial 
acceptance criteria with the exception of colouration since the colour standard was only specified for appearance 
testing for the process validation batches. 
Reference standard 
The reference standard used for analysis of finished product is the same as that used for active substance.  
PF-06439535 reference standards were generated as follows: a clinical reference material, primary reference 
material (PRM) and a working reference material (WRM). A two tiered system for in-house PF-06439535 
reference material has been implemented to support the commercial product. The existing primary reference 
Assessment report  
EMA/97237/2019 
Page 12/86 
  
  
material (PRM) and working reference material (WRM) have been suitably manufactured and characterised for 
their purpose.  
A protocol for the qualification of future reference standard is provided, which is acceptable.  
Stability 
A suitable shelf life is proposed for active substance stored at the intended storage conditions. This shelf life 
claim is based on an ICH compliant stability programme, including long term and accelerated conditions and 
under stressed conditions (thermal stress and photostability stress). Based on the data presented, the proposed 
active substance shelf life is supported. The proposed stability protocol containing adequate stability-indicating 
test parameters is considered appropriate. 
2.1.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as a liquid concentrate for solution for infusion as a 100 mg/4 mL presentation 
and a 400 mg/16 mL presentation.   
Zirabev finished product, 100 mg/4 mL presentation, is supplied in a 5 mL Type I clear glass vial sealed with a 
stopper and an aluminum seal with flip-off plastic cap. To ensure that a 4 mL nominal volume can be withdrawn 
from the vial, there is an overfill of approximately 0.3 mL. 
Zirabev finished product, 400 mg/16 mL presentation, is supplied in a 20 mL Type I clear glass vial sealed with 
a stopper and an aluminum seal with flip-off plastic cap. To ensure that a 16 mL nominal volume can be 
withdrawn from the vial, there is an overfill of approximately 0.5 mL.  
For both presentations there is no manufacturing overage. The two presentations are comparable and 
representative of one another in that the AS and formulated bulk FP used to make the Zirabev are identical for 
the two presentations. 
Zirabev finished product is formulated in succinate (buffer), sucrose (tonicifier), edetate disodium dihydrate 
(EDTA) (chelator), polysorbate 80 (surfactant), and water for injections (solvent) pH 5.5. The selected 
formulation for PF-06439535 is different from the licensed bevacizumab. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The formulation development program for Zirabev evaluated the effects of buffer type, pH and excipient 
selection on the chemical and physical stability of the active molecule. The composition of the final formulation 
is different from the reference product.  
There are two presentations for Zirabev intended to match the presentations in markets where the 
corresponding presentation of the Avastin licensed product is registered: 100 mg and 400 mg single-dose vials 
(100 mg/4 mL and 400 mg/16 mL). The formulation composition has remained the same throughout 
development. Only the 400 mg Zirabev presentation was used in clinical studies. Zirabev has been 
manufactured at the intended commercial manufacturing facility for the entirety of the clinical development 
program. No significant changes have been made to the overall process for Zirabev manufacturing throughout 
the product history.

EMA/97237/2019 
Page 13/86 
  
  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Zirabev 400 mg/16 mL and 100 mg/4 mL (both 25 mg/mL) presentations are manufactured using the same 
process steps and controls. The only differences between the presentations are the fill volume and the container 
closure system. All other manufacturing steps and process parameters are the same. 
The batch formula for Zirabev presentations 400 mg/16 mL and 100 mg/4 mL consists of the same bulk Zirabev 
formulation including 25 mg/mL PF-06439535, 85 mg/mL sucrose, 0.05 mg/mL edetate disodium dihydrate 
(EDTA), 0.2 mg/mL polysorbate 80, in 20 mM succinate buffer at pH 5.5.  
Frozen PF-06439535 active substance is shipped in appropriate containers. The active substance is thawed and 
transferred to a manufacturing vessel.  Dilution buffer is prepared and the active substance is diluted with the 
buffer to the target protein concentration.  The bulk finished product is then sterile filtered, aseptically filled into 
vials, stoppered and capped with a crimp seal.  Following the capping operation, the vials are visually inspected. 
Validation 
The manufacturing process has been validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. Process controls with 
their control limits for the finished product manufacturing process have been provided and are acceptable.  
Sufficient information is provided on filter validation and shipping validation. 
There is no excipient of human or animal origin and no novel excipient. An adequate elemental impurities risk 
assessment is presented in accordance with ICH Q3D. 
Product specification 
The list of test parameters for the finished product specification contains tests for control of identity, purity and 
impurities, potency and other general tests. The acceptance criteria are applicable from lot release to end of 
shelf-life.  The  specification  for  the  finished  product  release  has  been  set  in  accordance  with  Ph.  Eur. 
Requirements and ICH Q6B. 
Reference standard 
The reference standard used for analysis of Zirabev FP is the same as that used for the AS. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data are presented for FP lots for both presentations 100 mg  and 400 mg  used for clinical trials, 
stability and process validation. The results demonstrate consistency of the manufacturing process capabilities. 
All lots comply with the commercial acceptance criteria. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life for the unopened vial is 3 years when stored at the recommended temperature of 2 – 8 
°C. The FP should not be frozen and the vial should be kept in the outer carton in order to protect from light. The 
stability program followed the relevant ICH guidelines for stability of the finished product and data is provided 
for both 100mg/4mL and 400mg/16mL presentations. 
Stability data were provided for primary and supportive FP batches for both 100mg/4mL and 400mg/16mL 
presentations stored under the recommended long term conditions of 5 ± 3 °C, the accelerated condition of 25

± 2 °C/60 ± 5% relative humidity (RH). In addition data from thermal stress and photostability conditions were 
included. Additional long term stability data are provided for FP batches, which is considered representative and 
support the 3-year shelf-life at 2°C - 8°C. 
Based on the stability results an appropriate recommendation is made in the SPC.  
Zirabev FP is formulated as a concentrate for solution for infusion. Prior to administration Zirabev needs to be 
prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique to ensure the sterility of the prepared solution and 
diluted to the required administration volume with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. 
Studies were performed to evaluate the physicochemical stability and compatibility of PF-06439535 in 0.9% 
sodium chloride with commercially available administration components that are commonly used during 
preparation and storage of the dosing solution and/or during infusion. These studies were completed using 
several lots of FP including an aged FP lot near the end of its shelf life. 
Adventitious agents 
The approach for adventitious agents testing is described. The MCB and WCB testing is reviewed as part of the 
active substance control as well as the control of raw materials. 
The only material of animal origin identified is an antiserum used in clone selection, which is derived from sheep 
and stabilized in bovine serum albumin. A CEP is not available for this reagent and bovine serum albumin (BSA). 
However, the information on the origin of the serum indicates low risk of viral contamination and testing 
performed to qualify the cell line could be expected to have detected adventitious agents from these species. 
Viral clearance studies were performed with a suitable panel of model viruses on qualified small scale models. 
The total process clearance determined by summation of orthogonal removal/inactivation methods. 
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal product 
The Applicant has performed an extensive comparability analysis to demonstrate biosimilarity to the reference 
product Avastin (Avastin bevacizumab-EU and Avastin bevacizumab-US).  
The comparability assessment consists of a comparison of PF-06439535 to bevacizumab-EU, PF-06439535 to 
bevacizumab-US,  and  bevacizumab-EU  to  bevacizumab-US.  Formulation  differences  were  not  considered  to 
influence the analytical studies. Details of methods used in the characterisation and forced degradation studies, 
including method qualification or validation, are presented. 
A summary of the analytical similarity assessment is provided in Error!  Reference  source  not  found.. In 
general,  the  biosimilarity  assessment  performed  by  the  Applicant  is  considered  adequate  to  confirm  the 
analytical similarity between PF-06439535 and EU-approved Avastin.

2.1.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Module 3 of the dossier for PF-06439535 is of good quality and the information provided is sufficiently detailed. 
No major objection was raised by CHMP. Other concerns were raised in relation to several issues. The Applicant 
was requested to justify and explain the rationale behind their proposed control strategy and provide particular 
examples of expected critical process parameters (CPP) (e.g. pH, oxygen, density, temperature etc.). 
The Applicant provided additional data and explanations and was able to resolve all concerns. Two 
recommendations for post-authorisation follow-up related to the compound-specific toxicological risk 
assessment in case of any unexpected leachable and the ultrafiltration monitoring protocol for all parameters 
and scale down model viral clearance studies have been listed. One recommendation for pre-authorisation 
follow-up, relates to the provision of final protocols for the monitoring of chromatography resins and 
ultrafiltration membrane process steps.  
During the procedure a concern was raised in relation to differences observed in biological activity by the cell 
growth assay between PF-06439535 and the EU reference product. The Applicant justified the differences on the 
basis of assay variability. In conclusion based on the totality of evidence it was considered that sufficient 
reassurance on the conclusion of biosimilarity of bevacizumab versus the EU reference product was obtained. 
The Applicant has committed to re-evaluate the acceptance criterion for potency/biological activity after 
manufacture of recommended number of commercial batches as a post-authorisation recommendation.  
The analytical similarity between PF-06439535 and the reference products, Avastin bevacizumab-EU and 
Avastin bevacizumab-US, has been addressed in an extensive comparability exercise. The similarity between 
PF-06439535 and EU-approved Avastin can be confirmed. 
In conclusion, from a quality point of view, the MAA of PF-06439535 is approvable as a biosimilar to Avastin 
bevacizumab-EU. 
2.1.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety.  
The analytical similarity between PF-06439535 and the reference products, Avastin bevacizumab-EU and 
Avastin bevacizumab-US, has been confirmed in an extensive comparability exercise.  
In conclusion, from a quality point of view, the MAA of PF-06439535 is approvable as a biosimilar to Avastin 
bevacizumab-EU. 
2.1.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to take due account of technical and 
scientific progress, the CHMP recommended additional following points for further investigation, where the 
Applicant commits to:

 
notify authorities if an increase of a particular impurity of any unexpected leachable compound is 
observed at future time points of the on-going leachables study and provide the associated compound 
 
 
 
specific toxicological risk assessment.  
provide final protocols for the monitoring of chromatography resins and ultrafiltration membranes 
process steps.  
perform additional scale down model viral clearance studies in alignment with the manufacturing 
process.     
re-evaluate the acceptance criterion for potency/biological activity for active substance and finished 
product for this assay after manufacture of the recommended number of commercial batches. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The known mechanism of action (MoA) of bevacizumab is to bind VEGF, thereby inhibiting the interaction of 
VEGF and its receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 (Ellis, 2006)).  
VEGF is a major mediator of tumour angiogenesis and signals through VEGFR-2, the major VEGF signalling 
receptor (Kerbel, 2008). VEGF binds to VEGFR-2 on the surface of endothelial cells, leading to receptor 
dimerization and autophosphorylation, and activation of intracellular signalling pathways, including PI3K, Src, 
Akt, and ERK (Matsumoto & Claesson-Welsh, 2001). Activation of multiple signalling pathways eventually leads 
to biological responses which include cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival, and 
vascular permeability. All of these activities mediate the formation of new blood vessels. The applicant did not 
perform any own pharmacodynamics studies with PF-06439535. 
Physicochemical and functional characterization of PF-06439535, bevacizumab-US, and bevacizumab-EU was 
undertaken. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
To assess the similarity of pharmacologic response for PF-06439535 compared with bevacizumab, PF-06439535 
was tested in a panel of in vitro functional and binding assays that are reflective of the Mechanism of Action 
(MoA) of bevacizumab. In all of these assays, PF-06439535 was compared to bevacizumab-US and 
bevacizumab-EU, and bevacizumab-US was compared to bevacizumab-EU. 
The known MoA for bevacizumab involves the binding of the Fab domain of the monoclonal antibody to the VEGF 
target antigen in the extracellular matrix and preventing it from binding to its receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) 
on the surface of endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting VEGF activities. A functional assay was developed to 
measure inhibition of VEGF-induced cell proliferation in human endothelial umbilical vein cells (HUVEC). In 
addition, the binding of bevacizumab to the target antigen human VEGF was assessed with a binding 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
In compliance with Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies, 
following in vitro non-clinical studies have been performed:

- Binding to targets antigen: binding of bevacizumab to the target antigen human VEGF (VEGF165, VEGF121, 
VEGF189, and VEGF206) 
- Binding of PF-06439535, bevacizumab-US, bevacizumab-EU to representative isoforms of the relevant three 
Fc gamma receptors (FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII), FcRn and complement (C1q) 
- Fab-associated functions (Inhibition of VEGF binding to its receptors and cell proliferation) 
- Fc-associated functions of PF-06439535, bevacizumab-US, bevacizumab- EU: Lack of ADCC and CDC activity 
in VEGF expressing cells 
Together these assays broadly cover the functional aspects of PF-06439535. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics study with PF-06439535 was conducted. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology study has been conducted. Information on cardiovascular and respiratory 
endpoints was collected in the repeat dose toxicity study in young male Cynomolgus monkeys (see section 2.2.4 
Toxicology). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions study has been conducted. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Toxicokinetic (TK) and anti-drug antibody (ADA) evaluations were conducted in support of a 1-month 
repeat-dose toxicity study in young male Cynomolgus monkeys with PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU (Study 
13GR179) and a 2-week repeat-dose toxicity study of PF-06439535 in Sprague-Dawley rats (Study 8305590 
[14MA078]). Validated assays were used for the TK and ADA evaluations.  
Exposure to PF-06439535 was confirmed in both rat and monkey, and mean systemic exposure (as assessed by 
Cmax and AUC72) for PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU was similar in monkeys. The mean Cmax and AUC72 
exposure ratios of PF-06439535 relative to bevacizumab (EU) on Day 1 and 25 ranged from 0.8 to 1.0. 
Antibodies to PF-06439535 or bevacizumab were not detected in any animals treated with PF-06439535 or 
bevacizumab (EU).  
No studies on distribution, metabolism, excretion, or pharmacokinetic drug interaction have been conducted 
with PF-06439535. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose toxicity studies were conducted with PF-06439535.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Comparative study in monkey, PF-06439535 vs bevacizumab–EU (Study 13GR179, GLP) 
PF-06439535  and bevacizumab–EU were each administered by IV bolus injection to young male Cynomolgus 
monkeys (4/group) at 10 mg/kg/dose twice weekly for 1 month (Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, and 29). A 
separate group of monkeys (4 males) received the vehicle control article/diluent 1 used with PF-06439535 (20 
mM succinate, 85 mg/mL sucrose, 0.05 mg/mL EDTA, 0.2 mg/mL polysorbate-80, pH 5.5). Another group of 4 
males received the vehicle control article/diluent 2 used with bevacizumab-EU (60 mg/mL trehalose, 5.8 mg/mL 
sodium phosphate [monobasic], 1.2 mg/mL sodium phosphate [dibasic], 0.4 mg/mL polysorbate-20, pH 6.2). A 
10 mg/kg twice weekly dose was justified on the basis of the Originator’s toxicity studies in which physeal 
dysplasia was observed.  
Assessments included mortality, clinical signs, body weights, food intake, ophthalmic examinations, heart rate, 
electrocardiograms, respiration rate, haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis parameters. 
Blood samples were collected from all animals for measurement of PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU serum 
concentrations and determination of TK parameters. Blood samples were also collected from all animals for 
evaluation of ADA induction. At the end of the dosing phase, a complete necropsy was conducted, organs were 
weighed, and tissues were collected for microscopic evaluation. 
Administration of PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU was well tolerated. There were no PF-06439535 or 
bevacizumab-EU-related findings in clinical signs, body weight, food intake, ophthalmology examinations, 
respiration rate, electrocardiograms, haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis parameters. All 
animals survived to their scheduled euthanasia and there were no PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU-related 
changes in organ weights or macroscopic findings. 
All animals were sexually immature based on the microscopic appearance of the male reproductive tract tissues. 
All animals were skeletally immature based on the presence of active (open) growth plates observed 
microscopically in the distal femur. PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU-related microscopic findings were limited 
to the expected pharmacologically-mediated response of physeal dysplasia of the growth plate of the distal 
femur, with apparent similarity in incidence and severity (minimal to moderate) in all animals dosed with 
PF-06439535- or bevacizumab-EU. This finding was considered to be adverse for growing animals. There were 
no findings of physeal dysplasia in the two concurrent vehicle control groups.   
Non-comparative study in rat, PF-06439535 (study 8305590, GLP) 
A 2-week IV bolus repeat-dose study was conducted in SD rats (13-14/sex/group) administered PF-06439535  
at 0, 15, or 150 mg/kg IV twice weekly for 2 weeks (5 doses, Days 1, 4, 8, 11, and 15). Assessment of toxicity 
was based on mortality, clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmic examinations, and 
clinical and anatomic pathology. Blood samples were collected from toxicokinetic animals for toxicokinetic 
evaluations and ADA analysis.  
PF-06439535 had no effect on survival, clinical observations, food consumption, or ophthalmic examinations or 
clinical pathology parameters. PF-06439535 was associated with a non-adverse, statistically significantly 
minimally higher mean body weight gain in males administered 150 mg/kg/dose. This finding was not 
considered adverse because it was small in magnitude, did not correlate with other findings, and was within the 
range observed for this strain at this age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97237/2019 
Page 21/86 
  
  
 
No direct PF-06439535-related changes were present in the haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, or 
urinalysis test results. On Day 16 of the dosing phase, the male group administered 150 mg/kg/dose had 
minimally higher mean serum total protein concentration, and male and female groups administered 150 
mg/kg/dose had minimally to mildly higher serum globulin concentrations with concurrent minimally lower 
albumin:globulin ratios. Comparison of serum globulin concentrations to the plasma concentration of the test 
article (an immunoglobulin) indicated that higher serum globulin concentrations and changes in other serum 
protein parameters were due to the physical presence of the test article and not to a biological effect of test 
article administration. 
PF-06439535 was associated with minimal sinusoidal cell hyperplasia in the liver of males and females 
administered 150 mg/kg/dose. In males, this finding correlated with higher absolute and relative group mean 
liver weights (1.14 to 1.31x control) and was not adverse because of the minimal severity, lack of correlating 
clinical pathology findings, and absence of clinically observed detrimental effects on the health of the animals. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity study with PF-06439535 was conducted. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity study with PF-06439535 was conducted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproduction and development study with PF-06439535 was conducted. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics of PF-06439535 in SD rats (Study 8305590, GLP) 
After twice-weekly IV dosing of PF-06439535 at 15 or 150 mg/kg/dose in SD rats for 2 weeks, systemic 
exposure (as assessed by Cmax and AUC72) was similar in males and females across dose groups (Error! 
Reference source not found.). Mean systemic exposure increased with increasing dose in a slightly less than 
dose-proportional manner on Days 1 and 11. Based on mean AUC72 values, mean accumulation ratios (AUC72, 
Day 11/Day 1) ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 in males and from 2.7 to 3.0 in females across all dose groups. ADAs were 
not detected in animals dosed with vehicle or PF-06439535.

Repeat-dose toxicokinetics of PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU in Cynomolgus monkeys (Study 
13GR179, GLP) 
After twice-weekly IV dosing of PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU at 10 mg/kg/dose in young male Cynomolgus 
monkeys for 1 month there were no quantifiable concentrations of PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU in samples 
collected and analysed prior to dosing on Day 1, or in samples analysed from vehicle control groups. Quantifiable 
concentrations of PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU at all time points collected and analysed from day 1 through 
day 30 (day 29, 24 hours post-dose) confirmed exposure to PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU over the duration 
of the study. Mean systemic exposure (as assessed by Cmax and AUC72) for PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU 
was similar. The mean Cmax and AUC72 exposure ratios of PF-06439535 relative to bevacizumab-EU on Day 1 
and 25 ranged from 0.8 to 1.0. ADAs were not detected in animals dosed with PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU.

Local Tolerance 
No separate local tolerance studies have been conducted with PF-06439535. Compared with their respective 
vehicle controls, there were no adverse findings suggestive of injection site toxicity observed with PF-06439535 
or bevacizumab-EU in monkey (Study 13GR179). In the 2 week study in rat (Study 8305590), minimal to mild 
perivascular haemorrhage and/or mixed cell inflammation was observed at the intravenous injection site. The  
findings were considered unrelated to the test article because they were distributed randomly among groups, 
including the control group, and were considered secondary to the mechanical trauma associated with the 
injection procedure. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity of PF-06439535 in comparison with bevacizumab (EU) was assessed as part of the 1-month 
toxicology study in monkeys (Study 13GR179), and for PF-06439535 in the 2 week study in rat (Study 
8305590). No antidrug antibodies (ADA) were detected in the PF-06439535 or bevacizumab (EU) treated 
groups. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bevacizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk to the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Assessment report  
EMA/97237/2019 
Page 23/86 
  
  
 
Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), bevacizumab is exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk 
Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The comparability exercise indicates that PF-06439535, bevacizumab-US, bevacizumab- EU can be considered 
biosimilar except for the binding affinity to the FcƔRIIIa 158 F isoform and the FcRn SPR Binding Activity for 
which some differences were observed. During the assessment procedure, the applicant discussed specific 
concerns related to this in accordance with the current knowledge on different FcgRIII variants (e.g. ADCC 
mediation, proinflammatory cytokines production, potential link of some phenotypes of FcgRIII to neutropenia, 
Ab-Ag complex mediated damage or Lupus-like reactions). Bevacizumab does not have ADCC function and there 
is no pro-inflammatory cytokine production expected. Binding of bevacizumab to FcgRIII variants were 
concluded to be of no concern at the clinical level with respect to neutropenia, lupus-like reactions or 
antigen-antibody complex mediated damage. 
In conclusion, the small differences in bevacizumab FcgRIIIa 158F binding parameters or differences in patient 
FcgRIIIa genotype are considered unlikely to have clinical consequences.  
Based on the results from the similarity assessment, the lack of in vivo pharmacology studies with PF-06439535 
is acceptable and in line with guidance documents.  
Dedicated studies on secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, and pharmacodynamics drug 
interactions were not conducted. This is considered acceptable for a biosimilar product, and is also in accordance 
with Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and 
clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
Pharmacokinetic 
Sensitive analytical procedures for quantification of PF-06439535 and bevacizumab (ELISA and ligand binding 
assay), and ADAs against bevacizumab (ECL), have been developed and validated for rat and monkey serum. 
The analytical methods are of adequate quality and are considered acceptable. 
Systemic exposure (as assessed by Cmax and AUC72) for PF-06439535 and bevacizumab (EU) was comparable in 
monkey. ADAs were not detected neither in rats, nor monkeys dosed with PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU. 
However, quantifiable concentrations of PF-06439535 or bevacizumab (EU) present in samples may have 
interfered with the detection of ADA. 
The lack of studies on distribution, metabolism, excretion, or pharmacokinetic drug interaction for PF-06439535 
is acceptable and in line with EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010. 
Toxicology 
Repeated dose toxicity studies in non-human primates are usually not recommended for similar biological 
products (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). Nevertheless, a 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted 
with PF-06439535 and bevacizumab (EU) in young Cynomolgus monkeys. In addition, and on the request of a 
regulatory authority outside Europe, the applicant performed a 2-week toxicology study in rat to detect potential 
adverse effects related to the formulation. From a 3R perspective and with reference to the European guidance 
document EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010, neither the study in monkey, nor the study in rat were warranted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/97237/2019 
Page 24/86 
  
  
At 10 mg/kg twice per week, both PF-06439535 and bevacizumab (EU) were well tolerated in the 4-week repeat 
dose toxicity study in sexually and skeletally immature Cynomolgus monkeys, with similar incidence and 
severity of findings related to the pharmacological effect (physeal dysplasia) in both treatment groups. The 
study design included only one dose level (10 mg/kg twice per week). This was selected based on original study 
results with bevacizumab, allowing for comparison of effects on physeal dysplasia, the most sensitive finding in 
the original 4-week toxicity study in monkeys with bevacizumab. Overall, results indicate comparable toxicity, 
immunogenicity and exposure levels, between PF-06439535 and bevacizumab (EU) at a dose level of 10 mg/kg 
twice per week. 
In the rat study the NOAEL was established at the highest dose level (150 mg/kg/dose twice weekly for 2 
weeks). Given the lack of reactivity between PF-06439535 and VEGF in rat, the high NOAEL is as expected. 
The formulation for PF-06439535 is different from Avastin with respect to excipients used. The excipients are 
however well known and not expected to trigger adverse effects at the site of administration. No separate local 
tolerance studies have been conducted with PF-06439535. Compared with their respective vehicle controls, 
there were no adverse findings suggestive of injection site toxicity observed with PF-06439535 or 
bevacizumab-EU in monkey, or with PF-06439535 in rat.  
No ADAs to PF-06439535 of bevacizumab (EU) were detected in either study. However, high levels of circulating 
drug could possibly have interfered with the ability to detect antibodies in the drug safety studies. In monkeys, 
a pharmacological response was observed in all animals dosed with PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU. This 
finding supports that any theoretical formation of ADAs did not neutralise the effect of the mAb. In line with this, 
the animals’ plasma concentration of PF-06439535 and bevacizumab (EU) increased from day 1 towards the end 
of study. 
Overall, the results add to the totality of evidence to support the demonstration of PF-06439535 as a biosimilar 
product to bevacizumab (EU). 
Studies on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproduction and developmental toxicity were not conducted. This 
is considered acceptable, and in accordance with EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010. Sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the 
proposed SmPC are in line with the approved product information for Avastin. 
PF-06439535 is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
PF-06439535  can be considered similar to the reference product Avastin in terms of in vitro functionality 
(except for the binding affinity to the FcƔRIIIa 158 F isoform and the FcRn SPR binding activity for which some 
not clinically relevant differences were observed ), in vivo toxicological, toxicokinetic and immunogenicity 
profiles. The Summary table in Module SII of the RMP adequately reflects the important non-clinical findings 
with bevacizumab. The non-clinical findings with PF-06439535 were similar to findings reported for the 
reference product Avastin. Consequently, no additional measures are required.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  PF-06439535  were  studied  and  compared  to  those  of  both  EU-  and 
US-sourced bevacizumab (Avastin) in the clinical program: 
 
The first study (Study B7391002) was a single-dose, single-arm pilot pharmacokinetic (PK) variability 
study conducted with the reference  EU  product  bevacizumab  (not the test product  PF-06439535)  in 
healthy male subjects (n= 21). The Study was conducted to characterize inter-subject PK variability and 
safety profiles including immunogenicity of bevacizumab-EU following IV administration to healthy male 
subjects. The inter-subject variability, as indicated by the %CV, were 16%, 12%, and 15% for Cmax, 
AUCt, and AUCinf, respectively. 
 
The phase I clinical study B7391001 in healthy male subjects: the primary objective was to demonstrate 
the PK similarity of PF-06439535 relative to the EU and US reference bevacizumab, and of 
bevacizumab-EU to bevacizumab-US, following a single 5 mg/kg dose intravenously (IV) infusion. A 
complete blood sampling for PK assessment were collected from pre-dose and at specified times up to 
day 100 of study visits. 
 
The  phase  III  clinical  study  B7391003  in  patients:  the  secondary  objectives  of  the  study  included 
evaluation of serum trough bevacizumab concentrations at selected cycles. Blood sampling for predose 
(Cmax) PK assessment were collected prior to bevacizumab infusion at every cycle through cycle 17, and 
at end of treatment/Withdrawals. In addition, post-dose samples (apparent Cmax) were collected at 1 
hour after the end of the IV infusion for Cycle 1 and 5 (if the patient received Cycle 5). 
The same enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) bioanalytical method was used for the phase I study 
(B7391001)  and  the  phase  III  study  (B7391003).  PF-06439535  and  bevacizumab-EU  were  determined  by 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) following an antibody capture procedure.  Description and validation reports 
were  provided  with  satisfactory  results  regarding  precision,  accuracy,  selectivity  and  sensitivity,  short  and 
long-term stability and incurred sample reanalysis.  
In the Phase I PK study B7391001, the PK data were analysed using standard NCA approach with an internally 
validated  electronic  noncompartmental  analysis  (eNCA,  version  2.2.4)  software  system.  Pharmacokinetic 
parameters, e.g. AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, CL, Vss, and t1/2 were calculated according to standard procedures.

Standard  summary  statistics  (means,  median,  SD,  CV  etc…)  have  been  used.  Point  estimates  and  90% 
confidence  interval  (CIs)  for  the  ratios  of  the  geometric  means  (GMs)  for  AUClast,  AUCinf,  and  Cmax  were 
estimated using an ANOVA model for comparisons between PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU.  
To establish bioequivalence, the 90% CI for the test-to-reference ratio of GM for AUCt, AUCinf, and Cmax was to 
fall within the protocol-specified bioequivalence criteria of 0.80 and 1.25.

Phase I study (b7391001) 
This study was a double blind, single centre, randomised, parallel-group, single-dose, 3-arm, phase I study.  
The Primary objective was to demonstrate the PK similarity of PF-06439535 to bevacizumab-US and 
bevacizumab-EU following 5 mg/kg single IV dose administration of the three products. The primary PK 
endpoints were: Cmax, AUCinf and AUClast based on PK samples collected through Day 71. Ad hoc PK analysis 
was also conducted based on PK samples collected through Day 100. 
Test product was PF-06439535 (batch number 13-110832). Reference products were EU-sourced bevacizumab 
(batch 13-111567 and 13-111286) and US-sourced bevacizumab (batch 13-110446). 
The PK bridging objective was to compare the PK of bevacizumab-EU to bevacizumab-US. The safety objective 
was to evaluate the single-dose safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.  
A total of 97 subjects of 101 (who received the assigned drug) in 3 parallel groups (32, 33, and 32 subjects, 
respectively) were included in the PK data analysis. Exclusions from the per-protocol population for the primary 
PK analysis (4 subjects) are properly discussed and justified.  
To note, a sample size of 29 subjects per arm was calculated (based on the pilot PK study using the 
bevacizumab-EU) to provide at least 85% power for comparison in AUC and Cmax for the similarity objective 
between PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU. Thus, the available PK data are considered sufficiently sensitive to 
draw valid conclusions from the study. 
Demographic data (age, race, ethnicity, weight, height and BMI) were comparable among the 3 treatment 
groups. 
Blood samples (5 mL) for PK assessment were collected at pre-dose, 1.5 (end of infusion), 4 and 24 hours after 
the start of dosing, at days 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 64, 71 and 100 of study visits. 
Serum concentration-time data for bevacizumab (Pfizer), bevacizumab (US), and bevacizumab (EU) are 
summarised by treatment and time point in Table 5 . Median serum concentration-time profiles for 
PF-06439535, bevacizumab-EU, and bevacizumab-US are presented in Figure 2. The mean standard deviation 
(±SD) PK parameters for bevacizumab-Pfizer, bevacizumab-EU, and bevacizumab-US are summarized in Table

Source:  Table 14.4.3.3.1 
Median  serum  concentration-time  profiles  for  PF-06439535  and  bevacizumab-EU  appear  to  be  very  similar. 
Consistently, the mean standard deviation (±SD) PK parameters (Cmax, AUCs, CL, Vss, t1/2) for PF-06439535 and 
bevacizumab-EU were very similar, with similar inter-subject variability (CV% around 15 to 20%) for each of the 
PK parameters. 
For the purpose of PK similarity, the geometric LS means ratios from the primary PK analysis (based on up to 
Day 71 data) for the comparison of PF-06439535 and the reference beavcizumab-EU for Cmax, AUClast, AUCinf 
were  1.04,  1.00  and  0.99  and  the  corresponding  90%CIs  were  [98.36-110.84],  [93.69-105.93], 
[92.16-105.44], respectively.  Similarly, the geometric LS means ratios from the ad hoc PK analysis (based on 
up to 100 data) for the comparison of PF-06439535 and the reference beavcizumab-EU for Cmax, AUClast, AUCinf 
were  1.04,  0.99  and  0.99  and  the  corresponding  90%CIs  were  [98.36-110.84],  [92.61-105.38], 
[92.33-105.33], respectively. Thus, the primary endpoints (i.e. Cmax, AUClast, AUCinf) with their 90% confidence 
intervals are well within the predefined acceptance range of 80-125%. 
Additionally to investigation following single-dose administration in healthy volunteers (n=32), PK of 
PF-06439535 has been characterised under repeated doses in patients with non-squamous NSCLC. 
Phase III study (B7391003) 
This is a completed multinational, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, multiple dose study in adult 
subjects with non-squamous NSCLC receiving first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Paclitaxel 
and carboplatin were administered per dosing algorithm in the protocol. Bevacizumab (in combination or as 
monotherapy) was administered at the start of every 21-Day cycle (Q3W) at a dose of 15 mg/kg by IV infusion 
over 90 minutes.

A total of 719 patients at 216 centers were enrolled and randomized with 358 patients to the PF-06439535 group 
and 361 patients to the bevacizumab-EU group. Of these, 714 patients received at least 1 dose of study therapy, 
356 patients were assigned to the PF-06439535 group, and 358 patients were assigned to the bevacizumab-EU 
group. 
Blood samples for PK measurement were collected prior to bevacizumab infusion at every cycle through Cycle 
17, and at End of Treatment (EOT)/Withdrawals, and post-dose samples were collected at 1 hour (± 0.5 hour) 
after the end of the infusion of bevacizumab for Cycle 1 and 5 (if the patient received Cycle 5). 
The current PK data include all serum PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU concentration, available up to and 
inclusive of the data cutoff date of 08 May 2017. At this date, all the randomized patients had either completed 
the Week 25 visit or discontinued. Approximately 20% of patients had not reached the Week 55 visit.

N = Number of observations (non-missing concentrations) 
Mean and median trough (pre-dose) and apparent peak (1 hour post end of infusion at Cycle 1 and cycle 5) 
concentrations  appear  to  be  comparable  across  the  2  treatment  groups  for  all  time  points  measured  from 
baseline (time 0) through Cycle 18. Moreover, large but similar variance in each group (CV of 40 to 60%) was 
observed.

The mean and median bevacizumab Ctrough values increase steadily up to Cycle 9. This finding was observed for 
the two treatment groups (test and reference) but not consistent with the half-live (between 18 and 20 days) of 
bevacizumab and the Q3W dosing regimen.

Elimination 
Clearance and terminal half-life of PF-06439535, Bevacizumab-US, and Bevacizumab-EU were estimated in the 
phase I study b7391001. CL was 0.119 ml/hr/kg for PF-06439535, 0.122 ml/hr/kg for Bevacizumab-US, and 
0.117 ml/hr/kg for Bevacizumab-EU. t½ was 397 hr for PF-06439535, 413 hr for Bevacizumab-US, and 417 h for 
Bevacizumab-EU. No statistically significant difference was found between the treatments for any of the 
parameters. 
Special populations 
No studies were performed in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic data has been submitted as part of this application.  
No validated PD markers considered relevant to predicting efficacy of bevacizumab in patients do so far exist. 
Therefore, no PD markers were included in the PK study, and clinical endpoints were utilised in the phase 3 study 
in NSCLC patients. 
As the mechanism of action of bevacizumab, inhibition of tumour vessel growth, is expected to be similar across 
all approved cancer indications, extrapolation to other cancer indications of the reference product than advanced 
NSCLC is considered acceptable provided that similarity of PF-06439535  to the bevacizumab reference product 
has been convincingly demonstrated through comparability studies both at the quality, non-clinical and clinical 
level. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of PF-06439535 following a 5 mg/kg bodyweight single i.v. injection in healthy male 
volunteers has been determined in a pivotal PK similarity study (b7391001). 
The study design (number of subjects and sampling scheme) was chosen based on the assessment of 
inter-subject variability in a single dose pharmacokinetics study of bevacizumab in healthy male subjects 
(b7391002), and appears to be adequate. To support the PK findings of the pivotal phase I study, trough and 
apparent peak serum levels were determined during the repeat dose phase III clinical study. The primary 
endpoints of the phase I clinical study (i.e. AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax) with their 90% confidence intervals are well 
within the predefined acceptance range of 80-125%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97237/2019 
Page 35/86 
  
  
In the phase III study (B7391003), the observation that steady-state is achieved only around cycle 9 was 
explained by a decrease in number of patients evaluated for PK post cycle 6, and in addition a potential reduction 
in clearance of bevacizumab/ PF-06439535 in patients with therapeutic response. The basis for the latter 
explanation is not substantial, and is considered a postulation. However, the finding of slight increase of 
bevacizumab concentrations between Cycle 5 and Cycle 9 was reported for both test and reference treatments. 
Thus, PK similarity (the pivotal issue for this dossier) is not questioned. No formal investigations in subjects with 
impaired hepatic or renal function were performed. According to the originator´s product SmPC, PK of 
bevacizumab has not been investigated in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Thus, no study is 
required in the context of this biosimilar application. 
The results indicate that PF-06439535 is comparable to Avastin at the PK level. 
No new pharmacodynamic data has been submitted as part of this application. No validated PD markers 
considered relevant to predicting efficacy of bevacizumab in patients do so far exist. Therefore, no PD markers 
were included in the PK study, and clinical endpoints were utilised in the phase 3 study in NSCLC patients. 
As the mechanism of action of bevacizumab, inhibition of tumour vessel growth, is expected to be similar across 
all approved cancer indications, extrapolation to other cancer indications of the reference product than advanced 
NSCLC is considered acceptable provided that similarity of PF-06439535  to the bevacizumab reference product 
has been convincingly demonstrated through comparability studies both at the quality, non-clinical and clinical 
level. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The available PK/PD data support biosimilarity of PF-06439535 versus the EU reference product Avastin.

2.4.2.  Main study 
A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind study of PF-06439535 plus Paclitaxel-Carboplatin and 
Bevacizumab plus Paclitaxel-Carboplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced 
non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer 
Methods 
The main study B7391003 is a multinational, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial 
comparing the efficacy and safety of PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus bevacizumab-EU plus 
paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line treatment for patients with advanced (unresectable, locally advanced, 
recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous NSCLC.  A summary of study B7291003 is provided in Figure 3. The ITT 
population was comprised of 719 patients who were randomised to double-blind treatment, 358 patients to the 
PF-06439535 group and 361 patients to the bevacizumab-EU group. Randomisation was stratified by region 
(according to the location of the drug depot supplying the site), sex (male/female) and smoking history 
(never/ever). Two populations were defined for the efficacy analyses: ITT population and PP population. The ITT 
population was the primary efficacy analysis population. The PP population was used for sensitivity analyses of

the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. The estimated duration of study participation was approximately 
one year. Last subject last visit (LSLV) is defined as up to one year from randomisation of the last patient (End 
of Treatment) plus 28-day follow-up. The study was considered completed (End of Study) when the last patient 
completed the LSLV. See study scheme (Figure 3) for details.

Treatments 
Premedication for administration 
On treatment days when both bevacizumab and paclitaxel-carboplatin were administered, the order of 
administration was: 1) paclitaxel, 2) carboplatin, 3) bevacizumab. Bevacizumab monotherapy was administered 
following completion of at least four cycles and no more than six cycles of chemotherapy. 
Premedication to ameliorate the toxicities associated with the chemotherapy were to be administered according 
to the local label or institutional guidelines. 
Study drug administration 
Paclitaxel 
Following premedication, paclitaxel was administered as the first drug when chemotherapy was administered. 
Paclitaxel at a dose of 200 mg/m2 was administered by IV infusion over 3 hours on Day 1 in each cycle (21-day 
cycle). In the absence of progressive disease (PD), patients received paclitaxel treatment for at least 4 cycles 
but no more than 6 cycles. Dose reduction for toxicity was allowed. 
Carboplatin 
Carboplatin was administered by IV infusion over a minimum of 15 minutes, and could be administered 
immediately after the paclitaxel infusion had completed. Patients were administered carboplatin for at least 4 
cycles and no more than 6 cycles. Dose reduction for toxicity was allowed.  
Bevacizumab 
Blinded bevacizumab was administered once at the start of every 21-day cycle. The initial dose was 15 mg/kg 
delivered over 90 minutes as an IV infusion. The concentration of bevacizumab solution was required to be kept 
within the range of 1.4 mg/mL to 16.50 mg/mL. Infusions were not allowed to be administered as an IV push or 
bolus injection. Infusions were not allowed to be administered or mixed with dextrose solutions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/97237/2019

Patients received therapy until RECIST version 1.1 defined disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, discretion 
of the investigator, regulatory request, death, withdrawal of consent occurred, or End of Treatment whichever 
came first. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: To compare the efficacy of PF-06439535 versus Avastin (EU) 
Secondary objective: To assess and compare the immunogenicity and safety profile of PF06439535 versus 
Avastin (EU) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
  ORR - the percent of patients within each treatment group that achieved complete response (CR) or 
partial response (PR) by Week 19 of the study and subsequently confirmed on a follow-up tumour 
assessment by Week 25, based on the pre-specified equivalence margins required by EMA (-13% to 
13%). 
Secondary Endpoints 
 
Progression-free survival (PFS) at 1 year: Time from the date of randomization to first documentation of PD, 
or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD 
  Survival at 1 year: Time from date of randomisation to death due to any cause while the patient is in the 
study 
  Duration of response (DOR): Time from date of the first documentation of objective tumour response (CR or 
PR) to the first documentation of PD, or to death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD 
Sample size 
Based on the results of a meta-analysis combining Sandler (2006), Johnson (2004), and Niho (2012), the 
objective response rate (ORR) to bevacizumab + chemotherapy combination therapy was estimated to be 
approximately 40%, and the response rate to chemotherapy alone was estimated to be 21%. The relative risk 
(RR) of response for bevacizumab + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone was estimated to be 2.17 with 
95% CI (1.74, 2.70).  
Equivalence will be considered established if the 95% confidence interval of the risk difference falls into the 
margins (-0.13, 0.13).  
A sample size of 656 patients (328 per treatment arm) provides approximately 86% power for achieving 
equivalence in risk difference (RD) under specified margin of (-13%, 13%) with 2.5% type I error rate assuming 
an ORR of 38% in both treatment arms. This target sample size of 656 patients will provide approximately a 
power of 84% given above assumptions and assuming ORR=41%.  
Considering a possible ~7.5% attrition rate for patients reaching evaluation for ORR, a total sample size of 
approximately 710 patients (355 per treatment arm) were randomized to achieve the target sample size of 656.

Randomisation 
After screening and sponsor approval patients were randomised through an online Interactive Web Response 
System (IWRS), and received a unique patient identification number (ID) retained throughout the study. 
Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive at least 4 cycles and no more than 6 cycles of either PF-06439535 
plus paclitaxel and carboplatin or bevacizumab-EU plus paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by the assigned 
blinded bevacizumab monotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by region (according to the location of the 
drug depot supplying the site), sex (male/female) and smoking history (never/ever). Randomisation was 
according to a randomisation schedule generated by the Sponsor, and to which the Sponsor’s personnel directly 
involved in the study conduct were blinded. The only exception was in the event of an emerging safety issue 
which may have required breaking the blind. 
Blinding (masking) 
Treatment assignments for this study were blinded to the patients, investigator/study staff and Sponsor’s study 
team conducting the trial. The study pharmacists (or qualified designee) preparing treatment infusions were 
unblinded, and pharmacy records were monitored by a Sponsor appointed unblinded monitor.  
Statistical methods 
This was a comparative study aiming at demonstrating clinical equivalence of PF-06439535 and bevacizumab 
reference product by comparing the confirmed ORR by Week 19 following treatment.  
Hypothesis 
Two one-sided hypothesis tests was carried out in the study for ORR in order to show that bevacizumab-Pfizer 
is equivalent to bevacizumab-EU.  
TEST 1: H0a: θ1 - θ2 > Rub vs. H1a: θ1 - θ2 ≤ Rub 
TEST 2: H0b: θ1 - θ2 < Rlb vs. H1b: θ1 - θ2 ≥ Rlb 
Where Rub is the largest acceptable difference for equivalence, and Rlb is the smallest acceptable difference for 
equivalence. Note: Rlb = -Rub=-0.13.  
Populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population was defined as all patients who were randomized to study treatment, and 
was used for patient accountability and all efficacy analyses. The Safety population was defined as all subjects 
who received at least one dose of study treatment inclusive of chemotherapy. Patients were assigned to 
treatment groups “as randomized” for efficacy analyses, but “as treated” for all other analyses (if receiving both 
treatments, assigned to treatment initially given). The Per-Protocol (PP) population was defined as all patients 
who were randomized and received the study treatment (PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU) as planned and had 
no major protocol deviations. The PP population was used for sensitivity analyses of the primary and secondary 
endpoints. 
Statistical method of analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was ORR defined as the percent of patients within each treatment 
group who achieved a BOR of CR or PR by Week 19 in accordance with RECIST version 1.1, and subsequently 
confirmed on a follow-up tumour assessment by Week 25, based on the Sponsor’s derived best overall 
Assessment report

assessment using tumour measurements reported by the investigator in the CRF. The two 1-sided hypotheses 
were tested in this study for ORR in order to show that PF-06439535 was equivalent to bevacizumab-EU. For the 
EU, equivalence was considered established if the 95% CI of the risk difference falls into the margins (-13%, 
13%).  
The primary efficacy analysis for the primary endpoint in the ITT population was based on the Miettinen and 
Nurminen (1985) method without strata. Estimated risk ratio and risk difference and the asymptotic 95% and 
90% CI in ORR between PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU were computed. These values were used to 
determine equivalence based on the criteria defined above.  
The same analysis based on PP population was also performed as a sensitivity analysis. The Miettinen and 
Nurminen method was also carried out with additional stratification variables (region, gender and smoking 
history), to assess whether these variables would affect the risk ratio/risk difference of ORR between the 2 
treatment groups. This analysis was performed based on both ITT and PP population as secondary analyses.

Table 11: Patient Disposition 
Of the 719 randomised, 714 patients were included in the safety population and received at least one dose of 
study therapy inclusive of chemotherapy. Five patients did not receive any blinded bevacizumab or 
paclitaxel/carboplatin, including two patients randomised to the PF-06439535 group, and three patients 
randomised to the bevacizumab-EU group. Of these five randomised patients who did not receive any 
randomised treatment, two patients were mistakenly unblinded by Principal Investigators on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 
discontinued from the study, one patient discontinued as per the decision of the Sponsor and the Principal 
Investigator due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) condition, one patient 
withdrew consent after randomisation but before receiving any study drug, and one patient met exclusion 
criterion 15 (CNS metastases). One additional patient in the PF-06439535 group did not receive blinded 
bevacizumab due to hypertension after the administration of paclitaxel and carboplatin. This patient was 
included in the safety population. 
There were 714 (100.0%) patients who completed or discontinued from paclitaxel and carboplatin treatments 
(356 [100.0%] patients in the PF-06439535 group and 358 [100.0%] patients in the bevacizumab EU group).  
The majority of patients completed the protocol defined number of cycles (4-6 cycles) of chemotherapy. The 
most frequent reason for discontinuation from the study, including the survival follow up period, was death 
(136[38.2%] patients and 138 [38.5%] patients in the PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU groups, 
respectively).

Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of ORR was repeated on the final data as a sensitivity analysis. The 
analysis of ORR showed an un-stratified risk ratio of 1.0146 (PF-06439535 versus bevacizumab-EU), with a 95% 
CI of (0.8628, 1.1933) and a 90% CI of (0.8856, 1.1625), and an un-stratified risk difference of 0.6531% 
(PF-06439535 versus bevacizumab-EU), with a 95% CI of (-6.6080%, 7.9082%). The results were consistent 
with those from the analysis performed previously at Week 25.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study B7391003 is a multinational, double-blind, randomised (1:1), parallel-group, multiple dose study 
evaluating the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus 
bevacizumab-EU plus paclitaxel and carboplatin for the first-line treatment for patients with advanced 
non-squamous NSCLC.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Randomisation was stratified by region, gender (male/female) and smoking history (never/ever). A total of 719 
subjects were enrolled to receive either treatment of PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin or 
bevacizumab-EU plus paclitaxel and carboplatin for at least 4 and no more than 6 cycles, followed by 
bevacizumab monotherapy. 
All clinical studies were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and 
were consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) “Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP)” (ICH E6). GCP inspections were conducted at two centres by Ukraine Ministry of Health in the study and 
no major deviations were observed.  
The chosen patient population of histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of non-squamous NSCLC 
with the presence of newly diagnosed stage IIIB or IV NSCLC (according to Revised International System for 
Staging Lung Cancer Criteria of 2010) or recurrent NSCLC with at least one measurable lesion as defined by 
RECIST version 1.1, is considered acceptable for the purpose to establishing clinical similarity between 
PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel-carboplatin versus reference bevacizumab plus paclitaxel-carboplatin. NSCLC is 
regarded as a representative indication for the reference product. Exclusion of patients with known sensitising 
EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) or EML4-ALK translocation positive mutations, is 
considered appropriate. 
The drug was administered intravenously at hospitals and the regimen was according to the Avastin product 
labelling. The primary efficacy endpoint of Study B7391003 was ORR defined as the percent of patients within 
Assessment report  
EMA/97237/2019 
Page 58/86 
  
  
 
each treatment group who achieved a BOR of CR or PR by Week 19 in accordance with RECIST 1.1 and 
subsequently confirmed on a follow-up tumour assessment by Week 25. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the Phase 3 study were also according to the Avastin labelling and 
therefore considered adequate. Sample size calculations, randomisation and blinding procedures are also 
considered adequately performed.  
ORR is considered acceptable as primary endpoint since ORR in NSCLC patients have been observed to be the 
most sensitive endpoint observed through the bevacizumab reference product trials.  
The selected primary and secondary outcomes, their measurement time points as well as the pre-selected 
criteria for biosimilarity are in general according to the CHMP scientific advice provided, as well as according to 
relevant CHMP guidelines for biosimilar clinical development. RD of ORR at week 19 in the PP population with 
95% CIs has also been provided, confirming the conclusion on similarity of efficacy in the ITT population. 
The equivalence study design with the type I error rate controlled at 2.5% has previously been accepted by 
CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/667247/2015), and the planning of a trial based on the operating characteristic of an 
equivalence margin of about ± 12-13% points on the RD scale is considered feasible. The same advice pointed 
out that the chosen RD margin may be justified statistically by being lower than the lower bound of a 95% 
confidence interval from a meta-analysis. It was also pointed out that there is a need to justify the margin from 
a clinical perspective. There should be a clinical discussion of the irrelevance of the margin, which may lead to 
a smaller margin if the clinical irrelevance of the statistically derived margin cannot be justified. However, it is 
reasonable to assume that the margin would have been in the range of 10-13% regardless, and the result of the 
trial is well within these limits.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses  
Overall, 719 subjects with non-squamous NSCLC were randomised; 358 in the PF-06439535 arm vs. 361 in the 
bevacizumab-EU arm. Intent to treat was the main protocol specified population for analysis. There were no 
protocol deviations that were likely to significantly impact on study findings.   
Results from the analysis of the primary endpoint, ORR, met the pre-specified equivalence criterion in both 
populations. In the ITT population, the ORR was similar for the treatment groups (45.3% in the PF-06439535 
group and 44.6% in the -EU group). The analysis of ORR provided an un-stratified risk difference of 0.6531% 
(PF-06439535 versus bevacizumab-EU), with a 95% CI of (-6.6080%, 7.9082%), which fell entirely within the 
pre-determined equivalence margin (-13% to 13%). Further analysis of the PP population (both RD and RR) 
supports the conclusion. Sub-population analyses were conducted for ORR, and overall, no marked differences 
in the treatment comparisons were observed across subgroup categories. 
In the ITT population, the percentages of patients who progressed/died or were censored, were comparable 
between the two treatment groups.  
The probability of being progression free at Week 55 was 32.3% (95% CI: 26.9%, 37.8%) in the PF-06439535 
group and 30.5% (95% CI: 25.3%, 35.8%) in the bevacizumab-EU group. The probability of not having 
subsequent progression or death at Week 55 after a confirmed objective response was 32.0% (95% CI: 24.2%, 
40.1%) in the PF-06439535 group, and 30.8% (95% CI: 23.3%, 38.6%) in the bevacizumab-EU group. 
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of ORR was repeated at week 55 as a sensitivity analysis. The results 
were consistent with those from the analysis performed previously at Week 25. 
Assessment report  
EMA/97237/2019 
Page 59/86 
  
  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Similarity between PF-06439535 and EU-licensed bevacizumab reference product was demonstrated in the 
ITT-population, with RD of ORR at week 19 within the pre-specified equivalence margin (-13% to 13%). 
Equivalence between PF-06439535 and reference bevacizumab was also shown by RD of ORR in the PP 
population.  
From the statistical point of view, the choice of the margin using the 95-95 rule seems reasonable. Since the 
treatment effect attributable to bevacizumab is small, the applicant should have provided clinical justification for 
the equivalence margin obtained in the study, in addition to the statistical considerations in the report. However, 
based on similar studies it is likely that the confidence interval for the difference obtained in the study would 
have been within a clinically justifiable margin.  
The secondary outcomes (PFS, duration of response, OS) as well as the different sensitivity analyses were in line 
with the primary outcome, supporting the biosimilarity claim between PF-06439535 and the bevacizumab 
reference product.  
In conclusion, from an efficacy point of view, the MAA of PF-06439535 is approvable as a biosimilar to Avastin 
(bevacizumab-EU). Since the mechanism of action of bevacizumab is the same independent of indication, 
extrapolation to all other indications labelled for the reference product bevacizumab is considered acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Comparative safety data of PF-06439535 was derived from two clinical studies: 
  Study B7391001 was a, double blind, randomized, parallel-group, single-dose, 3-arm, comparative PK 
study of PF-06439535 and bevacizumab sourced from the US and EU administered to healthy males. 
  Study B7391003 was a multinational, parallel arm, randomized, double-blind, multiple dose study to 
compare the safety and efficacy of PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin with bevacizumab-EU 
plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in first-line treatment of advanced (unresectable, locally advanced, 
recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous-non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
The safety population consists of a total of 815 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication in 
studies B7391001 (101 subjects) and B7391003 (714 subjects) of which 388 subjects received PF-06439535. 
The safety data represent the final data when all patients have completed the week 55 visit.  
Patient exposure 
Study B7391001 
The subjects were randomized to one of the three arms to receive a single IV dose of 5 mg/kg of PF-06439535 
or bevacizumab-EU or bevacizumab-US. Exposure to investigational product was comparable across the 
treatment groups; 33 subjects in the PF-06439535 arm, 35 subjects in the bevacizumab-EU arm and 33 
subjects in the bevacizumab US arm. 
Study B7391003 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a IV dose of 15 mg/kg of PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel and 
carboplatin or bevacizumab-EU plus paclitaxel and carboplatin for at least four and no more than six cycles (1 
Cycle=21 days [3 week] ± 4 days), followed by the assigned blinded bevacizumab monotherapy. A total of 356 
Assessment report

patients received study treatment in the PF-06439535 treatment arm and 358 in the bevacizumab-EU treatment 
arm.

Grade 3 and 4 events of pulmonary embolism were reported in 8 (2.2%) patients in the PF-06439535 group and 
in four (1.1%) patients in the bevacizumab-EU group. From the eight patients with pulmonary embolism of 
Grade 3 or 4 in the PF-06439535 group, the causality was assessed as disease under study for three (0.8%) 
patients, PF-06439535 for four (1.1%) patients, of which one event was also attributed to paclitaxel and 
carboplatin in one (0.3%) patient, and disease under study in one (0.3%) patient also possibly attributable to 
PF-06439535. In the bevacizumab-EU group, Grade 3 and 4 events of pulmonary embolism were due to 
bevacizumab alone for three (0.8%) patients and disease under study for one (0.3%) patients.

patients had post-baseline shifts to Grade 4 hemoglobin decreased/anaemia in either treatment group. 
Chemistry  
The majority of patients in both treatment groups had chemistry baseline values of Grade 0 or Grade 1. Shifts 
from lower grades to higher Grades are as follows:  
ALT: Nine (9, 2.6%) patients in the PF-06439535 group and 3 (0.9%) patients in the bevacizumab-EU group 
had post-baseline shifts to Grade 3 ALT from baseline. No patients had post-baseline shifts to Grade 4 ALT in 
either treatment group. 
AST: Six (6, 1.8%) patients in the PF-06439535 group and 5 (1.4%) patients in the bevacizumab-EU group had 
post-baseline shifts to Grade 3 AST from baseline. No patients had post-baseline shifts to Grade 4 AST in either 
treatment group. 
Alkaline phosphatase: One (1, 0.3%) patient in the PF-06439535 group and 2 (0.6%) patients in the 
bevacizumab-EU group had post-baseline Grade 3 alkaline phosphatase. No patients had post-baseline Grade 4 
alkaline phosphatase in either treatment group. 
Total bilirubin: Five (5, 1.5%) patients in the PF-06439535 group and 2 (0.6%) patients in the 
bevacizumab-EU group had post-baseline shifts to Grade 3 total bilirubin from baseline. No patients had 
post-baseline shifts to Grade 4 total bilirubin in either treatment group. 
Serum or Plasma Creatinine: One (1, 0.3%) patient in the PF-06439535 group and 1 (0.3%) patient in the 
bevacizumab-EU group had post-baseline shifts to Grade 3 creatinine increase from baseline. No patients had

post-baseline shifts to Grade 3 hypoalbuminemia from baseline. No patients had post-baseline shifts to Grade 4 
hypoalbuminemia in either treatment group. 
Sodium: Ninety-three (93) patients in the PF-06439535 group and 96 patients in the bevacizumab-EU group 
had low sodium results post-baseline. Of these patients, 26 (28%) patients in the PF-06439535 group and 22 
(22.9%) patients in the bevacizumab-EU group had post-baseline Grade 3 hyponatremia. No patients in the 
PF-06439535 group and 2 (2.1%) patients in the bevacizumab-EU group had post-baseline Grade 4 
hyponatremia.

baseline Grades in either treatment group. 
Individual Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities 
Assessment report

Page 73/86 
  
  
Of the safety population, 3 patients had elevated ALT or AST defined as ≥3 × ULN and elevated total bilirubin of 
≥2 × ULN.  
One patient in the PF-06439535 group experienced elevated ALT of 683 IU/L (16 × ULN, reference range: 8 - 42 
IU/L), elevated total bilirubin 46.1 μmol/L (2.45 × ULN, reference range: 2 - 18.8 μmol/L) with AST and alkaline 
phosphatase within normal range on Study Day 106 after 6 cycles of combinational therapy and met the 
laboratory abnormalities component of the Hy’s law criteria. The patient continued on maintenance blinded 
bevacizumab monotherapy for an additional 16 cycles without recurrence of LFTs and/or total bilirubin 
elevations. Considering the ALT, AST and bilirubin values normalized despite continuing the 
bevacizumab-blinded therapy and background paclitaxel and carboplatin; the study Sponsor did not attribute 
the increased ALT and increased total bilirubin to bevacizumab-blinded therapy, to background chemotherapy or 
to any study procedure.  
The remaining 2 patients did not meet the Hy’s law criteria. Two (2) patients had elevated alkaline phosphatase 
(cholestasis) concurrently with elevated AST or ALT and total bilirubin. The investigators reported the 
alternative cause of the elevations as disease under study for both cases. 
Electrocardiograms 
A review of the data concluded that no clinically meaningful differences were observed for ECGs between the 2 
treatment groups. 
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction 
The mean LVEF values were generally comparable across the 2 treatment groups. A total of 30 patients had a 
maximum decrease of 10% to 19% from Baseline in LVEF at the End of Treatment visit, among whom 13 
patients were in the PF-06439535 group and 17 patients were in the bevacizumab-EU group. A total of 2 
patients had a maximum decrease of ≥20% from Baseline in LVEF at the End of Treatment visit (1 patient each 
in the PF-06439535 group and the bevacizumab-EU group). 
Immunological events 
Results from analyses based on Week 55 data 
Results of monitoring of immunogenicity, including long-term data until week 55, also showed comparable 
results between PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU, which supports biosimilarity.

According to the applicant, percentages were based on the number of patients at each visit. All samples were 
taken prior to dosing. For calculation of the overall incidence of post-treatment ADA, n=number of patients with 
at least 1 post Cycle 1 ADA sample were tested. Patients with a positive ADA sample at any time post Cycle 1 
were defined as having an overall positive ADA status. ADA positive samples was defined as ADA titer ≥2.29, 
ADA negative samples was defined as ADA titer <2.29.  
Table 41: Summary of neutralising Ab incidence by treatment group - safety population 
Mean serum concentrations of PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU seemed to be comparable between the two 
treatment groups at selected time points from Baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1) through Cycle 18 Day 1 in both 
chemotherapy and monotherapy periods. The observed rate of both ADAs and NAbs was low, with comparable 
percentages of patients with ADAs and NAbs observed for both treatment groups.  
Due to the low number of patients with ADAs, the association between immunogenicity and safety was difficult 
to evaluate. The presence of ADAs was apparently not associated with serious infusion related reactions or 
anaphylactic reactions.  
No apparent impact of the observed ADAs on PK was seen, since the PK concentrations in the ones with ADA 
positive samples were in general close to the group average of the observed concentrations in the corresponding 
treatment group. 
All five patients with treatment-emergent ADA in the PF-06439535 group had low titers and the observed 
treatment-emergent ADAs appeared to be transient. The same conclusion could be drawn for the 
bevacizumab-EU group, where the four patients with detected treatment-emergent ADAs had low titers and the 
treatment-emergent ADAs also appeared to be transient.

The number of patients that temporarily discontinued from bevacizumab only due to AEs was similar in the two 
groups (11.8 % in PF-06439535 vs. 10.9% in the bevacizumab-EU group). 
Blinded bevacizumab therapy continued until objective progression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawn consent.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population consisted of all subjects who received at least one dose of either PF06439535 from the 
single-dose, comparative PK study (study B7391001, N= 101) in healthy males and the phase 3, multi-dose 
study (study B7391003, N = 714) designed to compare the safety and efficacy in patients with advanced 
NSCLCs. The number of subjects exposed to PF-06439535 was 33 healthy males and 355 patients with 
advanced NSCLCs. 
The safety population is considered sufficient to study relevant safety signals of this comparability exercise.  
In study B7391001 the subjects were randomised to one of three arms (PF-06439535, bevacizumab-EU, 
bevacizumab-US) to receive a single IV dose of 5 mg/kg whereas in study B7391003 patients were randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to receive a IV dose of 15 mg/kg of PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin or 
bevacizumab-EU plus paclitaxel and carboplatin for at least four and no more than six cycles, followed by the 
assigned blinded bevacizumab monotherapy. Overall, in the B7391003 study, the extent of exposure was the 
same across both treatment groups with a mean duration of bevacizumab treatment being 12 cycles (week 55 
data cutoff). Paclitaxel and carboplatin treatment also had a similar median duration of treatment across both 
arms. In addition, the number of patients in each treatment cycle in the monotherapy setting was also similar 
between the two groups. Similar numbers of subjects that experienced TEAEs were reported in the three arms 
of the single-dose study 7391001 in healthy volunteers with no clinically meaningful differences. Also, the 
number of subjects with AEs as per SOC and PT are small and similar, and do not indicate a clinically relevant 
difference in safety signals between PF-06439535, bevacizumab-EU and bevacizumab-US given as single dose 
of 5 mg/kg in the study B7391001 of healthy subjects. No infusion related reactions (IRRs) were reported in this 
study. 
For study B7391003 the majority of patients (97 % in both arms) had at least one all causality TEAE, with similar 
number of patients that experienced SAE, grade 3 or 4 AE and grade 5 AE. Moreover, reported discontinuations 
were similar between the two groups and the primary reason for discontinuation of bevacizumab in both 
treatment groups was disease progression or relapse. The most frequently reported all causality TEAEs (>15%) 
were alopecia, anaemia, fatigue, nausea, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension and peripheral 
neuropathy. The majority of the events reported were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in both treatment groups with the 
exception of hypertension, where 9% had Grade 3 events in both groups. All causality SAEs were reported for 
22.8% in the PF-06439535 group and 22.3% in the bevacizumab-EU group, with the most frequent events 
including pneumonia, febrile neutropenia and pulmonary embolism with comparable numbers in both arms. 
Moreover, reported discontinuations were similar between the two groups and the primary reason for 
discontinuation of bevacizumab in both treatment groups was disease progression or relapse. The number of 
patients that temporarily discontinued from bevacizumab only due to AEs was similar in the two groups (11.8 % 
in PF-06439535 vs. 10.9% in the bevacizumab-EU group. 
Approximately half of all patients experienced at least one bevacizumab-related TEAE, with an even distribution 
between the two groups for the totality of events. However, a numerical imbalance between the two groups is 
generally reported with a higher incidence of patients that experienced bevacizumab-related SAEs (6.5 % vs 
4.7% in the PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU, respectively), grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (16.9 % vs 13.7%, 
respectively) and grade 5 TEAEs (1.7 % vs 0.3%, respectively) in the PF-06439535 arm. No clustering to a 
single SOC or PT was observed and the numerical imbalance is generally spread over the different PTs with few 
patients in each term (except for hypertension, neutropenia and anaemia that were reported most frequently). 
Based on the distribution of events over the different preferred terms, this difference is noteworthy, but is 
considered not to constitute a safety issue.

There were no bevacizumab-related IRR SAEs reported and no temporary or permanent study treatment 
discontinuations due to bevacizumab-related IRRs. For AESIs, similar frequencies were reported in both arms 
overall and considered to have no clinically meaningful differences.  
Importantly, the reported TEAEs are generally in line with the safety profile of the reference product Avastin, 
with no new safety findings reported in this study. No deaths were reported in study B7391001. 
In the PF-06439535 group 5.9% patients had Grade 5 events compared to 6.7% of patients in the 
bevacizumab-EU group, within the safety reporting period of TEAEs (all-causality). A notable difference in 
bevacizumab-related grade 5 events between the two arms was reported, with one bevacizumab-related Grade 
5 event (pulmonary haemorrhage) in the bevacizumab-EU group and six bevacizumab-related Grade 5 events 
(acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, haemoptysis, pulmonary haemorrhage, haemorrhage and death) in 
the PF-06439535 group.  This may relate to the general tendency of numerically more TEAEs in the 
PF-06439535 group as compared to the bevacizumab group. Immunogenicity was demonstrated to be 
comparable between PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU also after updating with long-term results from week 
55. 
Laboratory values for both haematology and chemistry were generally comparable between the two treatment 
groups. Few and comparable shifts in haematology to Grade 4 were reported in the two arms. Two patients in 
the bevacizumab-EU group and 1 patient in the PF-06439535 group had a post-baseline shift to Grade 4 
hyponatremia. 
One patient in the PF-06439535 group experienced elevated ALT of 683 U/L (16 × ULN, reference range: 8 - 42 
U/L), elevated total bilirubin 46.1 μmol/L (2.45 × ULN, reference range: 2 - 18.8 μmol/L) with AST and alkaline 
phosphatase within normal range on Study Day 106 after 6 cycles of combinational therapy and met the 
laboratory abnormalities component of the Hy’s law criteria. The patient continued on maintenance blinded 
bevacizumab monotherapy for an additional 16 cycles without recurrence of LFTs and/or total bilirubin 
elevations. Considering the ALT, AST and bilirubin values normalized despite continuing the 
bevacizumab-blinded therapy and background paclitaxel and carboplatin, it is not considered that the increased 
ALT and increased total bilirubin is attributed to bevacizumab-blinded therapy, to background chemotherapy, or 
to any study procedure. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on the safety documentation of comparative study B7391003 where PF-06439535 was compared to 
bevacizumab-EU (Avastin), no new safety signals different from the Avastin SmPC were detected. The 
submitted safety data are considered satisfactory to support a biosimilar claim for PF-06439535.

requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable as the package leaflet will have the same 
content and layout as the reference medicinal product Avastin. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Zirabev (bevacizumab) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it is a biological product authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The applicant seeks a marketing authorisation in the same therapeutic indication as approved for 
bevacizumab-EU (Avastin) which are not currently under patent protection: Adult patients with metastatic 
carcinoma of the colon or rectum, metastatic breast cancer, unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent 
non-small cell lung cancer, advanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer and persistent, recurrent, or metastatic 
carcinoma of the cervix. 
Quality 
To establish biosimilarity of PF-06439535 to Avastin bevacizumab-EU and bevacizumab-US on the quality level, 
an analytical similarity study was performed comparing PF-06439535 to reference bevacizumab-EU and 
bevacizumab-US. A total of 10 drug substance batches and 16 drug product batches of PF-06439535, 50 
batches of the reference product bevacizumab-EU and 46 batches of bevacizumab-US drug product (400 mg/16 
mL and 100 mg/4 mL presentations), were included in the analytical similarity study.  
Non-clinical 
Formal scientific advice from CHMP in 2015 included an opinion related to non-clinical development. In general 
the CHMP agreed that the proposed preclinical and pharmacological approach was sufficient for biosimilarity 
purposes. A GLP-compliant, 1-month, repeat-dose intravenous (IV) bolus comparative toxicity study in 
Cynomolgus monkeys of PF-06439535 with bevacizumab-EU has been conducted (Study 13GR179).  In 
Assessment report  
EMA/97237/2019 
Page 82/86 
  
  
addition, a non-comparative 2 week repeat-dose toxicity with only PF-06439535 was performed in rats, on the 
request of a regulatory authority outside Europe (Study 8305590). 
Clinical 
Pharmacokinetics 
With the present application (EMEA/H/C/4697) the applicant provided study results from three clinical trials 
regarding pharmacokinetics. 
In the phase I clinical study B7391002 in healthy subjects, the primary objective was to assess inter-subject 
variability in single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of bevacizumab in healthy subjects and for the planning of the 
pivotal PK study. 
The pivotal phase I clinical study B7391001 was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics following injection of 5 mg/kg body weight of PF-06439535 or bevacizumab (Avastin). 
Comparability could be concluded for both primary endpoints Cmax and AUCinf, and none of the other PK 
parameters revealed any statistically significant difference between PF-06439535 and Avastin. 
In the phase III clinical study B7391003, no difference in Ctrough was observed between the PF-06439535 and the 
bevacizumab groups at any time-point. 
Efficacy and safety 
Study B7391003: A completed, multinational, double-blind, randomised (1:1), parallel-group, multiple dose 
study evaluating the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin 
versus bevacizumab-EU plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in first-line treatment for patients with advanced 
(unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous NSCLC in the first-line treatment 
setting. The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of 
PF-06439535 versus bevacizumab-EU. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR)- the percent of 
patients within each treatment group that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Week 19 
of the study and subsequently confirmed on a follow-up tumour assessment by Week 25, based on the 
pre-specified equivalence margins required by EMA. Data from week 55 support the secondary endpoints. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
A comprehensive analytical similarity assessment which included comparative evaluations of biological 
activities, primary structure, higher order structure, N-linked glycan profile, charge heterogeneity, product 
purity (monomer, HMMS, HC+LC, fragments), disulfide bonds and forced degradation profiles. The biological 
activities were evaluated by a comprehensive set of functional assays and binding studies addressing both Fab 
and Fc-functions of the molecule. The inhibition of growth assay using HUVEC cells, used to measure potency, 
showed comparable responses for PF-06439535 and reference products. Comparable binding to VEGF target 
antigen by ELISA, was observed for isoforms VEGF165, VEGF121, VEGF189 and VEGF206. No differences are 
observed in FcRn, Fcγ and C1q binding. Additionally, no ADCC or CDC activity was observed. 
Non-clinical 
Overall, the results from the comparative toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys (Study 13GR179) add to the 
totality of evidence to support the demonstration of PF-06439535 as a biosimilar product to bevacizumab (EU). 
Repeated dose toxicity studies in non-human primates are usually not recommended for similar biological

products (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). From a 3R perspective and with reference to the European 
guidance document EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010, neither the study in monkey, nor the study in rat were 
warranted. 
Clinical 
Pharmacokinetics 
Comparability between PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU at the PK level has been shown in an adequately 
performed phase I PK study and a phase III efficacy/safety study.  
Efficacy 
Trial B7391003 met its primary objective. 
The results of the analysis of the primary endpoint, ORR, met the pre-specified equivalence criterion (-13% to 
13%) for the ITT population, the ORR was similar between both treatment groups (45.3% in the PF-06439535 
group and 44.6% in the bevacizumab-EU group). The analysis of ORR provided an un-stratified risk difference 
of 0.6531% (PF-06439535 versus bevacizumab-EU), with a 95% CI of (-6.6080%, 7.9082%), which fell within 
the pre-defined equivalence margins. Results obtained with the ITT population were supported by sensitivity 
analyses of the PP population and analysis of un-stratified risk ratio. Sensitivity analysis of data from Week 55 
further supports the conclusion made above. 
Safety 
Based on the safety documentation of the phase III study B7391003 where PF-06439535 was compared to 
bevacizumab-EU (Avastin), no new safety signals different from the Avastin SmPC were detected. The safety 
data are comparable in the two treatment groups and considered satisfactory to support a biosimilar claim for 
PF-06439535. 
Results of monitoring of immunogenicity, including long-term data until week 55, showed comparable results 
between PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU, also supporting biosimilarity. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality 
For PF-06439535 batches, the relative potency (measured by inhibition of cell growth assay) was observed to be 
in the lower region compared to that of bevacizumab-EU. However, the statistical quality range for relative 
potency of bevacizumab-EU covers the range for PF-06439535. In addition, binding studies to isoforms of VEGF 
by ELISA demonstrated comparable results between PF-06439535 and bevacizumab-EU.  
Clinical 
N/A 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Quality 
Analytical similarity of PF-06439535 drug product to reference product Avastin (bevacizumab-EU and 
bevacizumab-US) has been acceptably demonstrated, excepted for the potency measured by inhibition of cell 
growth assay (HUVEC assay). 
Assessment report  
EMA/97237/2019 
Page 84/86 
  
  
Clinical 
Pharmacokinetics 
Comparability between PF-06439535 and Avastin at the PK level has been shown in a phase I PK similarity study 
and a phase III efficacy/safety study. 
Efficacy 
Similarity between PF-06439535 and EU-licensed bevacizumab reference product was demonstrated in the ITT 
population. Equivalence between PF-06439535 and reference bevacizumab was also supported by sensitivity 
analysis of the PP population.  
Safety 
No signals of new adverse reaction were detected in the comparative study and within the limitation of a single 
study with a limited number of patients, the safety profile of PF-06439535 versus bevacizumab-EU is considered 
similar. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The mechanism of action of bevacizumab is the same, independent of indication. Therefore, extrapolation to all 
other indications labelled for the reference product bevacizumab is considered acceptable, provided that 
similarity of PF-06439535 to the bevacizumab reference product is convincingly demonstrated both at the 
quality, non-clinical and clinical level. Currently patented indications are excluded. 
3.6.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Zirabev is considered biosimilar to the reference product Avastin. 
Therefore, a benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Zirabev is favourable in the following indication: 
Zirabev in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult patients 
with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. 
Zirabev in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast 
cancer. For further information as to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, please refer to 
section 5.1. 
Zirabev, in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous 
cell histology. 
Zirabev in combination with interferon alfa-2a is indicated for first line treatment of adult patients with advanced 
and/or metastatic renal cell cancer.

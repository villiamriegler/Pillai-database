1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Aegerion  Pharmaceuticals  submitted  on  1  March  2012  an  application  for 
Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Lojuxta (originally under 
the  name  Lomitapide  Aegerion),  through  the  centralised  procedure  under  Article  3  (2)  (a)  of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by 
the EMA/CHMP on 19 May 2011.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Lomitapide Aegerion is indicated as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering drugs 
with  or  without  LDL  apheresis  to  reduce  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (LDL-C),  total 
cholesterol (TC), apolipoprotein B (apo B) and triglycerides (TG) in patients with homozygous 
familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). 
The  effect  of  Lomitapide  Aegerion  on  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  mortality  has  not  been 
determined. 
The  legal  basis  for  this  application  refers  to  Article  8(3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  -  complete 
and independent application. 
The  application  submitted  is  composed  of  administrative  information,  complete  quality  data, 
non-clinical  and  clinical  data  based  on  applicants’  own  tests  and  studies  and/or  bibliographic 
literature substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA 
Decision P/306/2011 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of 
submission of the application, the PIP P/306/2011 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation 
(EC)  No  847/2000,  the  applicant  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible 
similarity  with  authorised  orphan  medicinal  products  because  there  is  no  authorised  orphan 
medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication. 
Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
The  applicant  requested  consideration  of  its  application  for  a  Marketing  Authorisation  under 
exceptional  circumstances  in  accordance  with  Article  14(8)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004 
based on the following claim: 
Assessment report  
Page 6/107 
 
  
  
 
The applicant claimed that he is unable to provide comprehensive clinical data on the efficacy 
and safety of the medicinal product under normal conditions of use, as the indication for which 
the  product  in  question  is  intended  is  encountered  so  rarely  that  the  applicant  cannot 
reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence.  
According  to  Article  14(8)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  marketing  authorisations  under 
exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations. Continuation 
of the marketing authorisation shall be linked to the annual reassessment of these conditions. 
The applicant proposed the following obligations and conditions: 
—  the  applicant  will  have  to  conduct  a  prospective  observational  cohort  study  (registry)  to 
further  assess  the  safety of  lomitapide  in the  treatment  of  patients  with  HoFH  and  to  further 
assess the long-term effectiveness of lomitapide in usual care. 
— the medicinal product in question may be supplied on restricted medical prescription only  
—  the  package  leaflet  and  any  medical  information  shall  draw  the  attention  of  the  medical 
practitioner  to  the  fact  that  the  particulars  available  concerning  the  medicinal  product  in 
question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects. 
In  addition,  risk  minimisation  measures  will  be  set  up  by  the  applicant  as  agreed  with  the 
Agency  and  detailed  in  the  product’s  RMP  and  the  conditions  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of 
the product.  
New active Substance status 
The  applicant  requested  the  active  substance  lomitapide  contained  in  the  above  medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance in itself, as the applicant claims that it is 
not a constituent of a product previously authorised within the Union. 
Scientific Advice/Protocol Assistance

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare, life-threatening autosomal dominant 
genetic  disease  characterised  by  marked  elevations  in  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (LDL-
C).  The disease is typically caused by homozygosity or heterozygosity for mutations in the LDL 
receptor  (LDL-R)  gene  leading  to  impairment  of  LDL-R  function.    Phenotype  copies  result  from 
mutations in other genes, including apo B, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), 
and the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) LDL-R adapter protein, which alter the 
function  or  expression  of  LDL-R  or  adversely  affect  LDL  binding  to  LDL-R  interactions.    The 
prevalence of defects in both alleles of the LDL-R (homozygous) has been calculated to occur in 
approximately 1 in 1 million persons, based on the estimated prevalence of 1 in 500 for the more 
common  heterozygous  FH,  which  is  characterised  by  less  severe  hypercholesterolemia.    The 
prevalence  of  HoFH  has  been  reported  to  be  higher  in  certain  populations  with  a  presumed 
founder  effect.    The  frequency  of  HoFH  exceeds  0.2%  in  Ashkenazi  Jews  of  Lithuanian 
descendent, Afrikaners, French Canadians, Christian Lebanese, Druze, Sephardic Jews and Finns. 
Early onset of atherosclerosis is generally accompanied by accelerated disease progression, even 
in  the  early  teenage  years.    If  untreated,  most  subjects  do  not  survive  past  age  30  due  to 
sudden  death  from  acute  myocardial  infarction  (MI)  or  acute  coronary  insufficiency.    Early 
initiation  of  aggressive  treatment  for  these  subjects  is  therefore  essential.  In  terms  of  clinical 
management of these patients, statins are the treatment of choice for hypercholesterolemia due 
to  their  LDL  C-lowering  potency  and  well-documented  benefits  in  terms  of  CVS  morbidity  and 
mortality.  However, these therapies are not always adequate in patients with HoFH, due to the 
dependence of statin efficacy on up-regulation of a functional LDL-R.  
Lomitapide  is  an  oral  small  molecule inhibitor  of  microsomal triglyceride  transfer  protein  (MTP).  
MTP  is  an  intracellular  lipid-transfer  protein  responsible  for  transferring  triglycerides  and 
cholesterol  esters  onto  apolipoprotein  B  (apo  B)  in  the  assembly  of  both  very  low  density 
lipoprotein (VLDL) in the liver (the precursor to low density lipoprotein [LDL]) and chylomicrons 
in the intestine.  Inhibition of MTP activity has been shown to reduce hepatic VLDL and intestinal 
chylomicron  secretion,  and  consequently  to  lower  plasma  lipids  of  both  hepatic  and  intestinal 
origin. The proposed and recommended dose range for lomitapide is 5 mg to 60 mg given orally 
once daily. 
The clinical programme of lomitapide consisted of a total of 24 studies, including phase 1, 2, and 
3  studies  conducted  in  healthy  adults,  adults  with  HoFH,  adults  with  elevated  LDL-C  levels 
(without  HoFH),  adults  with  hepatic  impairment,  and  adults  with  end-stage  renal  disease  on 
hemodialysis. Across these studies, a total of 1145 patients and subjects were treated, including 
943  who  received  lomitapide,  either  as  monotherapy  or  coadministered  with  another  lipid 
lowering  therapy.  One  pivotal  single-arm  open  label  study  in  the  targeted  population  of  29 
patients with HoFH has been conducted. 
The proposed indication for lomitapide was: 
Assessment report  
Page 9/107 
 
  
  
 
Lomitapide  Aegerion  is  indicated  as  an  adjunct  to  a  low-fat  diet  and  other  lipid-lowering  drugs 
with  or  without  LDL  apheresis  to  reduce  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (LDL-C),  total 
cholesterol  (TC),  apolipoprotein  B  (apo B)  and  triglycerides  (TG)  in  patients  with  homozygous 
familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). 
The  effect  of  lomitapide  Aegerion  on  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  mortality  has  not  been 
determined. 
Lomitapide was proposed as a product for restricted medicinal prescription.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Lojuxta is presented as hard capsules containing 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg of lomitapide mesylate 
as active substance.  
Other  ingredients  are:  pregelatinized  starch,  sodium  starch  glycolate,  microcrystalline  cellulose, 
lactose  monohydrate,  silica,  colloidal  anhydrous,  magnesium  stearate,  gelatin,  titanium  dioxide 
(E171),  red  iron  oxide  (capsule  shell  5 mg  and  20  mg  only),  and  shellac,  black  iron  oxide, 
propylene glycol in the printing ink. 
The product is available in high density polyethylene bottles with an induction seal and fitted with 
a 38-mm twist off closure. 
2.2.2.  Active  substance 
The  chemical  name  of 
lomitapide  mesylate 
is  N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-9-[4-[4-[[[4'-
(trifluoromethyl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-yl]carbonyl] 
amino]-1-piperidinyl]butyl]-9H-fluorene-9-
carboxamide, methanesulfonate salt and has the following structure: 
The  structure  of  lomitapide  mesylate  has  been  derived  from  the  route  of  synthesis  and  was 
further elucidated satisfactorily by elemental analysis, IR, UV, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS. 
Lomitapide mesylate is a white to off-white powder, moderately hygroscopic and slightly soluble 
in water.  
Lomitapide mesylate has a non-chiral molecular structure.  
Assessment report  
Page 10/107 
 
  
  
 
 
Polymorphism  has  been  observed  for  lomitapide  mesylate.  Of  the  different  solid-state  forms, 
hydrates,  and  solvates  identified  in  the  polymorph  studies,  only  2  desolvated solid-state  forms, 
Form  I  and  Form  II,  were  identified  in  batches  after  drying  to  final  drug  substance.  The 
polymorphism will be controlled and limited according to batches used in the clinical studies.  
Manufacture 
Lomitapide  mesylate  is  synthesized  in  several  steps  using  well  defined  starting  materials  with 
acceptable specifications. The final particle size distribution is controlled during the crystallisation 
step.  The  specification  of  the  active  substance  includes  satisfactory  limits  for  particle  size 
distribution based on biobatch data.  
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU 
guideline  on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well 
characterised and discussed with regards to their origin.  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified 
by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (FT-IR,  HPLC), 
assay  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  water  content  (KF),  heavy 
metals, particle size, polymorphism and water content.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described. Compendial and in-house methods 
are appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications 
and consistent from batch to batch. 
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. 
Eur.  monograph.  Additional  specifications  have  been  set  for  particle  size  and  polymorphism  for 
the reasons exposed above.  
Stability 
Stability  data from  the  manufacturer  stored  in the  intended  commercial  package for 49  months 
under  long  term  conditions  at  25  ºC  /  60%  RH  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  Photostability 
testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed. Results on stress conditions (heat, acid, 
alkaline, oxidative) were also provided. 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  identification,  assay,  related  substances, 
polymorphism,  particle  size  and  water  content.  The  analytical  methods  used  were  the  same  as 
for release and were stability indicating. 
Assessment report  
Page 11/107 
 
  
  
 
The stability results support the retest period of 12 months when stored below 25 °C in double 
LDPE bags with desiccant between the bags, placed in a fibre tube. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Lojuxta is available in three strengths: 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg of lomitapide, as mesylate  
Pharmaceutical development 
The  manufacture  of  lomitapide  was  transferred  to  Aegerion  during  nonclinical  and  clinical 
development.  The synthesis of the active substance remained unchanged. The finished product 
formulation  and  manufacturing  processes  have  had  minor  changes  from  the  original  processes. 
All changes introduced have been satisfactorily supported with regards quality aspects as well as 
the performance of the product in vivo. 
The  10  mg  strength  has  not  been  used  in  clinical  trials.    However,  it  is  considered  that  a 
bioavailability  study  was  not  necessary  as  the  10  mg  strength  complies  with  the  waiver  criteria 
for an additional strength according to Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence.   
The  impact  of  the  active  substance  particle  size  and  polymorphism  was  considered  during 
pharmaceutical development and satisfactory studies were submitted supporting the limits in the 
specification of the active substance. 
The  excipients  used  in  the  lomitapide  drug  product  are  typical  excipients  found  in  hard-shell 
gelatin capsule solid oral dosage forms. The compatibility of the drug substance with excipients 
has been demonstrated through the stability data.  
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph. 
Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included above and in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is high density polyethylene bottles with an induction seal and fitted with 
a 38-mm twist off closure. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice 
of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the 
intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
Lactose monohydrate and the gelatin capsule shells are the only two materials of animal origin. 
It is confirmed that the lactose monohydrate is produced from milk from healthy animals in the 
same  condition  as  those  used  to  collect  milk  for  human  consumption  and  that  the  lactose  has 
been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note 
for  Guidance  on  Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents 
Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
Assessment report

Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of 
the gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.  
There are no novel excipients used in the manufacture of Lojuxta. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process for the production of Lojuxta capsules is a conventional method and 
has been sufficiently described.  
The processes for the manufacture of Lojuxta 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg capsules will be validated 
post-authorisation  in  accordance  with  EMEA  guidance  CPMP/QWP/848/96  EMEA/CVMP/598/99, 
Note for Guidance on Process Validation, March 2001. 
The  in-process  controls  have  been  evaluated  and  justified  with  results  from  pilot  scale 
manufacturing  and  are  adequate  for  a  standard  manufacturing  process  of  this  pharmaceutical 
form.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance,  identification  (HPLC,  MS),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC),  dissolution, 
uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), water content and microbiological quality. 
Batch analysis results are provided for each strength at different manufacturing sites confirming 
the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the  intended

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Lomitapide  was  proposed  for  use  as  an  adjunct  to  diet  and  other  lipid-lowering  drugs  with  or 
without 
low-density 
lipoprotein  (LDL)  apheresis 
in  patients  with  homozygous 
familial 
hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) and is proposed as a chronic treatment at a dose of 5mg to 60mg, 
given  once  daily.  A  dose  escalation  approach  was  suggested  in  order  to  achieve  the  optimal 
individualised dose to maximise efficacy and minimise gastrointestinal effects and transaminase 
elevations. Lomitapide represents a proposed new class of drugs with a mechanism of action that 
differs  from  those  of  other  classes  of  lipid  lowering  agents.  It  is  an  orally  bioavailable  small 
molecule  that  inhibits  microsomal  triglyceride  transfer  protein  (MTP),  which  plays  a  key  role  in 
the  assembly  of  lipoproteins  in  the  liver  and  intestines.  MTP  is  found  in  the  lumen  of  the 
endoplasmic  reticulum  and  is  responsible  for  binding  and  shuttling  individual  lipid  molecules 
between  membranes.  Lomitapide  inhibits  MTP,  thereby  reducing  lipoprotein  release  and 
circulating concentrations of lipoprotein-borne lipids including cholesterol and triglycerides in the 
blood  stream.  Lomitapide has  a  mechanism  of  action  that  differs  from  those of  other  classes of 
lipid lowering agents. 
Patients  with  homozygous 
familial  hypercholesterolemia  have  severely  elevated 
lipid 
concentrations,  causing  patients  to  develop  cardiovascular  disease  mostly  before  age  30. 
Lomitapide  was  developed  because  currently  available  drug  therapies  fail  to  adequately  reduce 
LDL cholesterol levels in these patients and the only alternative treatment is plasma apheresis, a 
mechanical filtration used to remove lipids from the blood.

All  toxicity  and  safety  pharmacology  studies  that  were  considered  pivotal  for  the  human  safety 
assessment were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
In vitro and in situ studies based on previously reported methods were used to demonstrate the 
effects of lomitapide on microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity. The MTP binds to 
and  transfers  lipid  molecules  from  the  site  of  lipid  synthesis  to  apolipoprotein B  (apo B)-
containing  lipoproteins  in  both,  enterocytes  and  hepatocytes.  Inhibition  of  MTP  prevents  the 
assembly  of  apo B-containing  lipoproteins,  thus  reducing  their  release  into  the  systemic 
circulation.  Lomitapide  treatment  is  intended  to  reduce  total  cholesterol  (total C),  LDL-C, 
triglycerides, and apo B in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).  
Lomitapide was shown to inhibit recombinant human MTP-mediated transport of several neutral 
lipid substrates.  In an assay that selectively assessed lipid substrate transfer between donor and 
acceptor small uni-lamellar vesicles (SUV, a type of liposome), triglyceride and cholesteryl ester 
(CE)  transfers  were  equivalently  inhibited  with  an  approximate  IC50  of  0.5 nM.    The  IC50  for 
triglyceride  transport  was  1.2 nM.    In  contrast,  the  transfer  of  phosphatidylcholine  (PC)  was 
weakly inhibited (IC50 >100 nM; maximum decrease of 18%).  The MTP has a specific preference 
for binding and transporting nonpolar lipids (e.g., triglycerides) compared with phospholipids. In 
a competitive assay when human MTP was incubated with a photoactivatable analogue that binds 
to  MTP  in  the  absence  or  presence  of  lomitapide  the  binding  of  the  analogue  was  reduced  by 
15%  and  69%  in  the  presence  of  10  and  100  nM  lomitapide,  indicating  that  lomitapide  binds 
directly  to  MTP.  A  similar  competitive  assay  was  performed  in  human  hepatoblastoma  cells 
(HepG2)  cells.  The  amount  of  triglyceride  bound  to  MTP  was  reduced  in  a  dose-dependent 
manner with an IC50 of 1.2 nM. Furthermore, lomitapide potently inhibited triglyceride transport 
of rat, hamster, and human MTP, with IC50 values between 5 and 7 nM.  
With  respect  to  the  possible  pharmacological  activity  of  the  metabolites,  the  major  lomitapide 
metabolite,  M3,  was  about  400-fold  less  active  than  lomitapide  as  an  inhibitor  of  triglyceride 
transfer  activity  of  bovine  MTP.    Another  important  metabolite  of  lomitapide,  M1,  had  no 
significant inhibitory activity. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  noted  that  the  studies  showed  that  lomitapide  is  active  in  inhibiting  lipid 
transfer,  confirming  its  proposed  mechanism  of  action.  In  vitro  activity  of  lomitapide  in  lipid 
transfer assays seems to differ more between studies than between species. 
In vivo studies 
The  primary  pharmacodynamic  actions  of  lomitapide  in vivo  were  characterised  using  rodent 
(mouse, rat, and hamster) and nonrodent (rabbit and monkey) models.   
Rats:  A  rat  Triton  model  was  used  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  lomitapide-mediated  inhibition  of 
MTP  on  very  low  density  lipoprotein  (VLDL)  secretion  in  fasted  versus  fed  rats  (VLDL  is  the 
lipoprotein  that  contains  the  highest  amount  of  triglycerides).    Triton  blocks  the  clearance  of 
plasma  triglyceride-rich  lipoproteins,  which  are  secreted  from  the  liver  and  intestine.    Pre-

treatment  of  fasted  or  fed  rats  with  lomitapide  inhibited  the  Triton-induced  accumulation  of 
plasma  triglycerides.    The  ED50  values  of  0.19 or  0.15 mg/kg  were  obtained  following  oral  or 
intravenous administration of lomitapide to fasted rats and the ED50 following oral administration 
to  fed  rats  was  0.15  mg/kg  (IV  administration  not  determined  in  fed  rats).  Approximate 
equivalent  potency  was  thus  observed  in  both  fasted  and  fed  states,  indicating  that  VLDL 
secretion  from  both  intestine  and  liver  are  inhibited  by  lomitapide.  No  elevations  in  alanine 
aminotransferase  (ALT)  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  levels  were  observed  at  3.5  h 
following lomitapide administration. 
Oral  administration  of  lomitapide  to  rats  once  daily  for  3 days  resulted  in  a  dose-dependent 
lowering of total cholesterol; the oral ED50 was 2.5 mg/kg; VLDL/LDL as well as HDL-cholesterol 
were lowered equivalently at all doses (0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg). Plasma triglyceride levels were 
reduced  by  36%  and  63%  compared  to  controls  at  3 and  10 mg/kg  doses,  respectively.    No 
changes in plasma levels of ALT or AST were observed.   
Hamsters:  Hamsters  have  proved  to  be  a  useful  model  of  human  lipoprotein  metabolism,  since 
hamster  LDL-cholesterol  responds  to  changes  in  dietary  lipid  intake  in  a  manner  that  is 
essentially identical to that in humans and the kinetics of LDL-cholesterol have been worked out 
in detail in this species. Oral administration of lomitapide to hamsters (4-5 per treatment group) 
once  daily  for  3  days  resulted  in  dose-dependent  reductions  in  total  cholesterol,  VLDL+LDL-C, 
and  HDL-C.    The  ED50  for  total  cholesterol  reduction  was  2.0 mg/kg.    At  10 mg/kg,  the  highest 
dose  tested  the  plasma  triglyceride  levels  were  also  significantly  reduced  (by  26%).    A  slight 
increase in plasma AST was also observed at 10 mg/kg (<2× control value).   
To  explore  the  effects  of  extended  inhibition  of  MTP,  hamsters  on  standard  or  high-fat  diets 
received lomitapide  orally at  daily  doses  of  1,  3,  and  6 mg/kg  for  up  to  3 weeks.    Hamsters  on 
the  high  fat  diet  developed  a  stable  hyperlipidemic  state  after  5  days  of  this  diet.  Lomitapide 
resulted in a significant dose-dependent lowering of plasma total cholesterol after 1 to 3 weeks of 
dosing for both diets. However, ED50 values for total-C reduction in hamsters fed a high-fat diet 
were  approximately  50%  lower  than  those  for  hamsters  on  the  standard  diet  at  all  3 time 
intervals.  Tissue  triglyceride  levels  were  determined  in  liver  and  small  intestine.  A  dose 
dependent  elevation  in  tissue  triglyceride  levels  was  observed  (up  to  6.5-fold  in  small  intestine 
and  up  to  3-fold  in  liver;  no  increase  was  observed  over  the  weeks).  The  decreases  in  HDL-C 
were unlikely to be due to a direct effect on HDL production given that the ED50 for inhibition of 
secretion  of  apo A1  in  HepG2  cells  was  about  8000×  higher  than  the  ED50  for  inhibition  of 
secretion  of  apo B.    Hamsters  (4  per  treatment  group)  were  dosed  with  lomitapide  at  0  or 
10 mg/kg once daily for 7 days. Groups of hamsters were sacrificed at various days following the 
cessation  of  treatment,  up  to  6  days  after  treatment.  Plasma  total  cholesterol  and  triglycerides 
were  lowered  by  >85%  compared  to  controls  after  3  or  7 days  of  dosing.    Recovery  of  both 
parameters occurred 48 hours or 72 hours post-dose, respectively.  After treatment, triglycerides 
at first rose to levels higher than control levels, but they stabilized to control levels at 72 h post-
dose.  At  Days 3  and  7,  tissue  levels  of  triglycerides  were  increased  approximately  3-fold 
(hepatic).  The  CHMP  noted  that  after  the  cessation  of  treatment  in  hamsters,  a  rebound  effect 
seemed to occur on plasma triglycerides, but not on cholesterol. 
Rabbits:  Homozygous  Watanabe-heritable  hyperlipidaemic  (WHHL)  rabbits  have  hepatic  LDL 
receptor  activity  <5%  that  of  normal  rabbits,  which  results  in  dramatically  elevated  levels  of 
apo B-containing lipoproteins.  For this reason, WHHL rabbits are a good model for human HoFH.  
Assessment report

The  lomitapide  ED50  for  total-C  lowering  in  these  rabbits  (n=5)  was  1.9 mg/kg  after  14 days  of 
dosing;  triglyceride  levels  were  lowered  in  parallel.    At  a  dosage  of  10 mg/kg  given  daily  for 
14 days,  plasma  total-C  and  triglyceride  levels  were  reduced  84%  to  92%  and  60%  to  90%, 
respectively. 
Mice:  Lomitapide  was  administered  orally  by  gavage  at  1  mg/kg  for  4  days  to  wild-type  mice 
(C57BL6) and to knockout mice (a humanized LDL-receptor-deficient mouse model, LAHB mouse 
transduced  with  cholesteryl  ester  transferase  protein  and  human  apo A1).    Lomitapide  reduced 
plasma lipids in both mouse models: reductions in plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, 
and/or  apo B  were  approximately  75%  at  1.5  or  3 mg/kg  and  50%  at  1 mg/kg,  respectively.  
Apo A1 was not decreased. Hepatic triglyceride levels were increased 3-fold to 5-fold compared 
to controls at doses from 0.5 to 3 mg/kg in LAHB mice and wild type mice; hepatic levels of total 
cholesterol were not increased.  
Cynomolgus  monkeys:  In  cynomolgus  monkeys  (5  per  treatment  group)  fed  a  standard  diet, 
lomitapide  administered  orally  once  daily  for  14 days  at  doses  of  0,  1.25,  2.5,  or  5 mg/kg 
significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol at all 3 dose levels on treatment Days 7 (by 35.3%, 
64.6% and 81.0% resp.) and 14 (by 31.1%, 59.2% and 74.8% resp.). The ED50 was 2.1 mg/kg.  
Significant  dose-dependent  reductions  in  plasma  levels  of  VLDL+LDL-C  and  HDL-C  also  were 
observed. Lomitapide clearly decreased plasma cholesterol in cynomolgus monkeys. Triglycerides 
were decreased significantly at day 7 of treatment. At day 14 of treatment, the control value was 
very low and therefore no significant decrease in plasma triglycerides could be found at that time 
point.  Changes  in  creatine  kinase  levels  were  not  statistically  significant  either.  Another  study 
was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys on a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet. Cynomolgus monkeys 
adapted  for  4 weeks  to  a  high-fat/high-cholesterol  diet  had  2-fold  to  3-fold  increases  in  total-C 
and  VLDL+LDL-C,  but  no  increases  in  HDL-C  and  triglycerides,  compared  to  monkeys  fed  a 
standard  diet.  Following  oral  administration  of  lomitapide  at  5 mg  once  daily  for  14 days, 
significant reductions were observed on Days 7 and 14 for plasma total cholesterol, VLDL+LDL-C, 
and HDL-C, but not for triglycerides. Again, variability in the control group may have contributed 
to a lack of effect on triglycerides.  Creatine kinase was not significantly changed.  
To  further  understand  the  variable  effects  of  lomitapide  on  plasma  triglycerides  in  monkeys, 
another study was conducted in monkeys fed with a standard diet. Lomitapide 2.5 and 5 mg/kg 
was given for 7 consecutive days and plasma triglycerides and cholesterol were determined at 10 
and  24  h  after  the  last  treatment.  At  10 hours  postdose  on  Day 7,  significant  reductions  were 
observed  in  plasma  triglyceride  levels  at  daily  doses  of  2.5 mg/kg  (153%)  and  5 mg/kg  daily 
(171%).  However, at 24 hours post dose, there was no effect on plasma triglycerides. The CHMP 
noted  that  lomitapide  actually  prevented  the  postprandial  increase  of  triglycerides  in  monkeys, 
instead of lowering the baseline value, whereas for cholesterol, baseline values were decreased. 
In  vitro  studies  also  showed  that  lomitapide  inhibited  transfer  of  triglycerides  and  cholesteryl 
esters  in  small,  unilamellar  vesicles.  The  studies  indicate  that  lomitapide  binds  directly  to  MTP 
and  the  IC50  values  of  inhibition  of  MTP  of  different  species  in  studies  with  small  unilamellar 
vesicles  varied  between  0.5  and  15.5  nM.  In  HepG2  cells,  lomitapide  potently  inhibited  apo  B 
secretion,  while  apo  A1  secretion  was  only  weakly  inhibited.  These  data  thus  confirm  the 
proposed  mechanism  of  action.  Furthermore,  lomitapide  significantly  reduced  plasma  total 
cholesterol, VLDL/LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol in rats with triton-induced accumulation of

plasma  triglycerides,  hamsters,  hyperlipidaemic  rabbits,  humanized  LDL-receptor  deficient  mice 
and cynomolgus monkeys. 
Nevertheless,  evidence  of  lipid  accumulation  in  liver  and  small  intestine  was  observed  in 
hamsters and mice. Lipid accumulation was also observed in toxicology studies in mice, rats and 
dogs. Lipid accumulation in liver and small intestine is consistent with the mechanism of action: 
since  transport  of  lipids  to  the  blood  is  inhibited,  liver  remains  at  the  site  of  synthesis  or 
absorption. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In previous rat studies, lomitapide caused effects on coagulation and in high doses and patients 
with  abetalipoproteinemia  demonstrated  in  some  cases  a  deficiency  of  fat-soluble  vitamins 
vitamin  K  and  vitamin  E.    In  order  to  investigate  the  role  of  vitamin  K  in  lomitapide-induced 
toxicity, rats were treated with 0, 125 or 250 mg/kg p.o. for 14 days with or without vitamin K 
supplementation.    Without  supplementation,  both  doses  resulted  in  toxic  effects,  including 
reduced body weight gain and prolonged clotting times compared to controls.  Supplementation 
with vitamin K completely reversed the prolongation of both prothrombin time (PT) and activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT), but did not reverse the lack of body weight gain. The effect 
of fat-soluble vitamin K is likely related to the impact of MTP inhibition on chylomicron formation. 
It is likely that vitamin K absorption is inhibited by lomitapide. 
Results from a battery of in vitro and in vivo general pharmacology studies were also described 
(non-GLP).  In  mice  and  rats,  effects  on  CNS,  gastrointestinal  motility  and  urinalysis  were 
investigated  at  doses  0,  3,  10,  30  or  100  mg/kg.  No  behavioural  effects  were  observed  except 
for  dose-related  transient  reductions  in  locomotor  activity  and  reductions  in  the  incidence  of 
writhing  to  pain  stimuli  in  mice  at  30  and  100  mg/kg.  In  mice,  gastrointestinal  motility  was 
suppressed at 100 mg/kg, but not at 30 mg/kg. Urinary excretion of Na+ and K+ (µEq/6 h) was 
decreased in rats at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg and urinary volume was decreased at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg. 
At 100 mg/kg, protein was found in the urine of all rats. Effects on gastrointestinal motility were 
further  investigated  in  isolated  rabbit  ileum  and  in  guinea  pig  isolated  ileum  with  contractions 
induced  by  various  agonists.  No  adverse  effects  were  observed  on  contraction  or  motility  at 
concentrations  as  high  as  60 ng/mL  (about  10×  higher  than  the  predicted  steady-state  Cmax  in 
humans  at  60 mg)  in  isolated  ileum  preparations  from  rabbits  and  guinea  pigs.  Respiratory 
evaluations, blood pressure, heart rate and ECG were measured in dogs dosed intravenously with 
0,  0.8,  1.8,  4  or  20  mg/kg.  Intravenous  administration  of  20 mg/kg  lomitapide  produced 
generally transient  effects  including increased  respiratory  rate;  decreased blood  pressure,  heart 
rate, and femoral arterial blood flow. No effects were observed following single intravenous doses 
of 0.8, 1.8, or 4 mg/kg.  
The  CHMP  noted  that  no  significant  effects  on  general  activity  and  behaviour  were  observed 
except  for  a  transient  reduction  in  locomotor  activity  in  mice.  Decreased  blood  pressure,  heart 
rate, and femoral arterial blood flow and increased respiratory rate were observed in dogs only at 
high exposures. Similarly, at high doses, urinary volume was decreased and protein was found in 
urine  of  rats.  The  cause  of  these  effects  is  not  identified,  however  they  are  not  expected  to  be 
clinically  relevant  since  they  were  observed  mainly  at  very  high  doses  and  furthermore,  no 
kidney toxicity was observed in toxicology studies.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Assessment report

The  ICH S7A  core  battery  of  GLP  safety  pharmacology  studies  was  not  conducted  with 
lomitapide.  Several  non-GLP  safety  pharmacology  studies  and  GLP-compliant  CNS  and  hERG 
safety  pharmacology  studies  were  carried  out.    Regarding  studies  for  CNS  effects,  non-GLP 
studies  as  well  as  GLP  studies  were  performed.  A  non-GLP  cardiovascular  study  in  dogs  as  well 
as  a  GLP  hERG  assay  was  conducted,  and  ECG  measurements  in  dogs  were  performed  in  GLP 
repeated dose studies. Only in case of the tests on potential effects of lomitapide on respiration, 
a  non-GLP  study  was  available,  but  there  does  not  seem  to  be  a  signal  that  lomitapide  causes 
adverse effect on respiration. The increased respiration rate in dogs occurred at high exposures 
only, and was associated with a decrease in blood pressure. The CHMP noted that not all safety 
pharmacology  studies  were  performed  in  compliance  with  GLP.  However,  overall,  the  pivotal 
components  were  in  compliance  with  GLP.  Thus,  the  CHMP  considered  the  quality  of  the  safety 
pharmacology studies sufficiently guaranteed. 
In  vitro  evaluation  of  the  effects  of  lomitapide  on  receptor  and  ion-channel  ligand  binding 
demonstrated significant levels of inhibition of radio-ligand binding to serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2 
receptors, the sigma receptor, and the type 2 sodium channel.  Relative to the predicted human 
Cmax  at  60 mg,  these  IC50  values  are  at  least  44  times  higher,  and  thus,  not  expected  to  be 
clinically relevant.  
A study examining the effects of lomitapide on general behavioural in male rats showed that one 
hour  following  oral  administration  of  150  mg/kg  or  vehicle,  no  adverse  effects  were  observed.  
No  significant  effects  on  mean  arterial  pressure  of  normotensive  rats  were  observed.    A  mild 
decrease  (18%  compared  to  controls)  in  heart  rate  was  observed  after  24  hours.  The  GLP-
compliant  safety  pharmacology  study  conducted  in  female  rats  in  order  to  assess  the  effects  of 
lomitapide on gross behavioural and physiological status revealed that no major adverse effects 
were observed following any of the lomitapide doses. Rats treated with chlorpromazine exhibited 
effects  consistent  with  it’s  pharmacology,  including  catalepsy  and  decreased  motor  activity  and 
alertness. In a hERG assay, inhibition of IKR by lomitapide and by metabolite M1 was observed 
at concentrations at least 250 times the human Cmax. In dogs, no effects on ECG were observed. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No nonclinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with lomitapide and a 
justification  was  put  forward  based  on  the  fact  that  markedly  hyperlipidaemic  animal  models 
would  be  needed  to  carry  out  meaningful  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  with 
lomitapide.  The  applicant  considered  that  it  might  be  therefore  more  appropriate  to  obtain  this 
data  in  humans  and  avoid  the  unnecessary  use  of  animals  which  supports  the  3Rs  principles  in 
accordance  with  ICH  Topic  M3  (3Rs).  The  principles  of  the  3Rs  as  quoted  in  the  ICH  guidance 
[CPMP/ICH/286/95] is endorsed by the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic- and toxicokinetic parameters of lomitapide and its metabolites M1, M2 and M3 
were determined in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys given lomitapide orally and/or intravenously. 
Plasma-protein binding was assessed in vitro across species, including humans. Biliary excretion 
was  studied  in  bile-duct  cannulated  rats.  Metabolism  of  lomitapide  was  assessed  in  vitro  in 
hepatocytes  from  mice,  rats,  dogs  and  humans,  and  in  vivo  in  rats  and  dogs.  The  lomitapide 
metabolite  M3  was  approximately  400x  less  active  than  lomitapide  and  M1  had  no  activity. 
Assessment report  
Page 19/107 
 
  
  
 
Therefore, it was concluded that M1 and M3, as well as metabolites of M1 and M3, did not exhibit 
pharmacologic  activity  at  therapeutic  doses  in  humans.  All  single-dose  studies  were  conducted 
without using a validated method of analysis. The toxicokinetics of lomitapide investigated in the 
repeated-dose studies on the other hand were determined by validated LC/MS/MS methods. 
The CHMP noted that two different salts were used in the pharmacokinetic studies: hydrochloride 
(HCl)  and  mesylate.  Lomitapide  mesylate  is  the  active  substance  in  the  proposed  product  and 
this  salt  was  used  in  the  dog  pharmacokinetic  studies  while  the  HCl  salt  was  used  in  rats  and 
monkeys.  It  was,  however,  acknowledged  that  toxicokinetic  data  in  rats  with  the  mesylate  salt 
existed  as  well  and  the  CMP  asked  for  a  comparison  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  the  two 
different  salts  and  the  possible  impact  on  interpretation  of  the  pharmacokinetic  data.  In 
response,  an  overview  and  discussion  on  the  early  pre-clinical  studies  using  the  HCl  salt  was 
provided.  None  of  these  suggest  any  impact  on  the  safety  margins  generated  between  animals 
and  humans  and  thus,  the  change  in  salt  during  development  is  not  considered  to  have  any 
significant impact on the safety data. 
Lomitapide has a low and variable oral bioavailability of approximately 7-54% in humans and the 
non-clinical  species,  which  is  caused  by  a  large  first-pass  effect.  Dose-normalised  systemic 
exposure values for lomitapide after a single dose were found in the following order: dog > rat > 
monkey,  which  is  consistent  with  the  observed  bio-availabilities  in  these  species.  The  time  to 
reach maximum plasma concentrations was found to be dependent on the formulation used, i.e. 
oral administration of lomitapide in gelatine capsules led to higher T max values than in solution. 
In  all  three  non-clinical  species,  the  volume  of  distribution  is  high,  varying  between 
approximately 3 and 38 L/kg, with the largest volume of distribution found in monkeys and the 
smallest  in  dogs.  Plasma  half-lives  were  comparable  in  the  non-clinical  species:  approximately 
11-14 hours in rat and dog after oral dosing and around 12 hours after IV dosing. Repeated oral 
administration of lomitapide generally led to plasma accumulation up to approximately 4-fold in 
rat  and  dog.  The  Cmax  and  AUC  values  generally  increased  in  a  dose-proportional  manner,  but 
were  more  than  dose-proportional  in  mice.  Only  at  the  highest  tested  dose  of  80  mg/kg,  the 
increase  in  dose  was  accompanied  by  a  less  than  dose-proportional  increase  in  lomitapide 
exposure.  However,  for  the  other  two  non-clinical  species,  rat  and  dog,  lomitapide  exposure 
could increase in proportion linear to the dose. 
Based  on  AUC0-24h  metabolite-to-parent  ratios,  systemic  exposure  to  lomitapide  and  its 
metabolites occurred in the following order in the pre-clinical species: M3>lomitapide>M1>M2 in 
mice;  M2≥M3>lomitapide>M1  in  rats;  and  lomitapide>M1>M3>M2  in  dogs.  The  metabolites 
were not pharmacologically active at clinically relevant concentrations and no in vivo toxicity was 
observed. 
Lomitapide  is  extensively  bound  to  plasma  proteins  in  the  non-clinical  species  and  in  humans 
(>99.4%).  Due  to  the  high  plasma  protein  binding  of  lomitapide,  interactions  with  other  drugs 
may occur. Furthermore, changes in the health status of patients may result in differences in free 
fraction  and  consequently  different  systemic  plasma  exposures.  As  plasma  protein  binding  was 
determined at much higher concentrations than the clinical Cmax  due   to technical difficulties, the 
CHMP  considered  this  to  be  an  uncertainty  for  the  interpretation  of  adverse  effects  found  in 
animal studies for relevance for humans. These uncertainties are addressed in the clinical part of 
this report and reflected in the clinical major objection that the CHMP rose during the evaluation.

The observed blood-to-plasma ratio indicates that either lomitapide slowly binds to erythrocytes, 
or that metabolites bind to erythrocytes.  
Consistent with its high volume of distribution, lomitapide is widely distributed in various tissues 
with the highest overall cumulative radioactivity exposure. The target organ, the liver, was well 
exposed  after  oral  administration  in  both  rats  and  dogs,  with  lomitapide  concentrations  several 
hundred fold higher than plasma levels. Radioactivity concentrations declined in rats in all tissues 
but  were  still  higher  than  the  blood/plasma  concentrations  at  24  and  48  hours,  except  for  the 
eyes and brain. This indicates that with repeated dosing tissue accumulation cannot be ruled out 
(see section on Repeat Dose Toxicity). Lomitapide does not readily cross the blood-brain or the 
blood-testes  barrier  as  concentrations  in  the  blood  and  in  the  testes  were  almost  consistently 
lower than those in plasma. 
At clinical concentrations, lomitapide is extensively metabolised. The major metabolic routes are 
mono-oxidation  and  N-dealkylation,  followed  by  further  oxidation  and/or  glucuronidation.  The 
CYP3A4/5  was  found  to  be  the  enzyme  responsible  for  most  of  lomitapide’s  metabolism.  In 
addition, CYP2E1 may play a role, especially in the formation of M9 metabolite. Metabolite M2 is 
most likely formed by other systems than the human liver CYPs and related to the formation of 
M1.  Metabolism  in  mouse,  rat  and  dog  hepatocytes  was  less  extensive  than  in  human 
hepatocytes  with  unchanged  lomitapide  as  the  major  component  (~45-68%).  However,  all 
human metabolites were also observed in hepatocytes of at least two animal species. The in vivo 
metabolite  profiles  differed  from  the  in  vitro  profiles  and  differed  across  species.  More 
metabolites were observed in vivo than in vitro. 
Excretion  via  faeces  is  the  major  excretion  pathway  in  all  species  after  oral  administration  of 
lomitapide. Secretion into bile constitutes another possible excretion pathway. Urinary excretion 
is  only  a  very  minor  route  in  rat,  but  accounts  for  the  excretion of  about  a third  of the  dose  in 
humans. Excretion via urine might be an important elimination route also for dogs, but the data 
should  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  low  total  recovery.  No  data  on  the  excretion  of 
lomitapide  in  milk  has  been  provided.  It  is  of  note  that  the  complete  excretion  will  most  likely 
take  longer than  24  hours.  Therefore,  once-daily  repeated  dosing  with  lomitapide  may  result  in 
accumulation  of  lomitapide  in  the  body.  Transport  of  lomitapide  via  p-glycoprotein  is  probably 
limited.  However,  the  results  could  not  be  readily  interpreted  as  the  recoveries  from  the 
experiments were very low, which was caused by non-specific binding and cellular accumulation. 
Lomitapide  was  found  to  be  an  inhibitor  of  p-glycoprotein,  however,  not  at  clinically  relevant 
levels.  Transport  via  the  transporters  BCRP,  OATP1B3,  OCT1,  OAT1,  OAT3  and  OCT2  was  not 
inhibited  by  lomitapide.    Lomitapide  was  not  proven  to  be  an  inhibitor  of  CYP1A2  and  2E1 
activities.  In  addition,  at  clinically  relevant  plasma  concentrations,  lomitapide is  not  an  inhibitor 
of CYPs 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. However, since lomitapide is subject to a large first pass 
effect  and  the  gut  concentrations  will  be  much  higher  than  the  plasma  concentrations, 
interactions  with  other  drugs  may  occur  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  This  issue  is  addressed  in 
the  clinical  section  of this report. The  metabolites of  lomitapide,  M1  and  M3, were  not  found  to 
inhibit  CYP  iso-enzymes  1A2,  2A6,  2B6,  2C8,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  2E1  and  3A4  directly  or  time-
dependently  at  clinical  relevant  concentrations.  Lomitapide  nor  its  metabolites  M1  and  M3 
induced CYP1A2, 3A4 or 2B6 activities.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  CD-1  mice,  SD  rats  and  beagle  dogs.  Effects  of 
lomitapide  mesylate  were 
investigated  on  body  weight,  clinical  assessment,  physical 
examinations,  gross  pathology,  and  histopathology  of  organs  with  gross  pathology  lesions.  In 
dogs,  also  food  consumption,  ECG,  blood  pressure  measurements  and  ophthalmoscopy  were 
performed (see table below).

The mice that died within 1 day in study BMS-96011 had a moderate distention of the stomach 
with fluid, but no microscopic findings were observed. Mice dosed IV at 50 mg/kg died within 2 
minutes  of  dosing  in  study  BMS-96035.  In  orally  dosed  rats,  cases  of  mortality  occurred  at  8 – 
12 days after dosing. Rats dosed IV at high dose died within 30 minutes of dosing. Clinical signs 
in  the  dogs  such  as  head  shaking,  emesis,  decreased  activity  and  ataxia  were  ascribed  to  the 
presence  of  Tween-80  in  the  vehicle.  In  general,  lethal  doses  after  oral  administration  were  at 
least 1000 times higher than the maximally recommended human dose of 60 mg/day.

Repeated dose studies were performed in rats, dogs and mice. In the repeated dose studies, the 
most  important  observed  effect  was  lipid  accumulation  in  the  liver  and  small  intestine  as  a 
consequence of the pharmacological effect. This was observed at doses comparable to the ED50 
and at exposures comparable to the human therapeutic exposure. Accumulation does not seem 
to  increase  with  time  of  treatment  and  evidence  of  reversibility  was  shown  after  cessation  of 
treatment  in  a  mechanistic  study  in  rats.  However,  fat  accumulation  remains  to  be  present 
during long-term treatment and this involves a risk of adverse effects such as liver toxicity and 
perhaps also liver carcinogenicity. In the liver, besides fat accumulation, single cell necrosis and 
increases  in  ALT,  AST  and  ALP  were  observed  at  exposures  comparable  to  or  lower  than  the 
human exposure (rat) or at exposures from 20 times the human exposure (dogs) based on AUC. 
Furthermore,  in  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study,  besides  lipid  vacuolation  also  fibrosis  and,  in 
males,  cystic  degeneration  were  observed  in  the  liver.  In  clinical  studies,  hepatic  fat 
accumulation  and  transaminase  elevations  were  observed.  Liver  toxicity  is  further  discussed  in 
the  clinical  section  of  the  report.    In  the  small  intestine,  no  damage  was  observed  besides  fat 
accumulation.  
Multifocal haemorrhages and extramedullar haematopoiesis, as well as increases in APTT and PT, 
were  observed  in  rats.  This  was  most  likely  caused  by  vitamin  K  deficiency  due  to  inhibited 
absorption  of  fat-soluble  vitamins,  since  no  haemorrhages  were  observed  in  vitamin-
supplemented  animals.  Decreased  red  blood  cell  parameters,  poikilocytosis  and/or  anisocytosis 
were also observed in animal studies and the CHMP requested an explanation of their mechanism 
and  clinical  relevance.  It  was  argued  that  the  abnormal  red  blood  cell  morphology  can  be 
ascribed to abnormalities in cell membrane lipid structure secondary to low cholesterol levels due 
to  the  pharmacological  effect.  The  CHMP  considered  this  a  plausible  explanation;  however, 
decreases in red blood cell parameters, although mostly observed at high exposures in animals, 
cannot be completely excluded. Therefore, anaemia is included as side effect in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC.  
Decreased food consumption and decreased body weight compared to controls was observed in 
several  studies  in  rats,  dogs  and  mice.  In  rats  and  mouse,  decreased  body  weight  was  only 
observed  in  males.  In  the  6-month  dog  study,  tubular  degeneration  in  the  testes  occurred, 
however  the  exposure  was  very  high  compared  to  humans  (205  times  based  on  AUC  of  69.5 
ng.hr/mL in humans at 60 mg). In the lungs of rats, mild histiocytosis was detected following 3

months  administration  of  lomitapide  and  was  reversible  from  4  months  after  treatment.  There 
was no evidence of phospholipidosis or structural damage to the lungs. 
Genotoxicity 
A standard package of genotoxicity assays was conducted. Lomitapide concluded to be negative 
for mutagenic potential in the bacterial reverse mutation assay and for the induction of structural 
and numerical chromosome aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Lomitapide was 
shown not to be genotoxic in a rat micronucleus study. 
Carcinogenicity 
The following carcinogenicity studies were performed with lomitapide:

tumour incidences. Benign 
pancreatic adenomas were 
increased in males at 7.5 
mg/kg/day with systemic 
exposure to lomitapide at 
6x that of humans at 60mg. 
In  the  mouse  carcinogenicity  study,  occurrence  of  hepatocellular  adenoma  and  carcinoma  were 
observed,  but  no  apparent  large  scale  lipid  accumulation  in  the  liver.  In  the  small  intestine  of 
mice,  lipid  vacuolation  was  observed  as  well  as  increased  epithelial  carcinoma.  In  the  rat 
carcinogenicity study, there was no clear increase in occurrence of liver tumours, but at the high 
dose, there was a tendency to an increase when adenoma and carcinoma of males and females 
were summarised. In the small intestine, lipid vacuolation was observed but without an increase 
in the number of tumours. In rats, lipid vacuolation was observed in the acinar pancreas. Overall, 
the  date  could  indicate  an  association  between  lipid  accumulation  as  a  consequence  of  the 
pharmacological  action  of  lomitapide  and  the  development  of  tumours  in  liver,  small  intestine 
and,  after  long-term  exposure  in  rats,  also  in  the  pancreas.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  requested 
information  on  whether  the  accumulation  of  lipids  in  liver,  small  intestine  and  pancreas  could 
possibly  lead  to  tumour  development,  as  well  as  estimation  and  monitoring  of  this  risk  in 
humans. The applicant provided further reassurance that the available data indicating occurrence 
of  tumours  in  liver,  small  intestine  and  pancreas  do  not  seem  to  be  directly  related  to  lipid 
vacuolation  in  these  organs.  Since  the  risk  of  tumour  development  cannot  be  completely 
excluded,  further  monitoring  of  tumours  in  a  prospective  observational  cohort  study,  with 
emphasis  on  small  bowel,  hepatic  and  colorectal tumours  was  proposed.  The  CHMP  agreed  and 
Assessment report

requested  that  the  pancreas  tumours  are  monitored  as  well.  This  is  sufficient  considering  the 
claimed indication in the small patient population. The prospective observational cohort study is 
included  in the  Risk  Management  Plan  and an  adequate  statement  regarding pancreatic  tumour 
findings is present in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Small  increases  in  thyroid  follicular  cell  adenoma,  adrenal  medulla  hyperplasia,  and  pituitary 
adenoma in rats were observed more in animals at scheduled sacrifice than in animals that died 
or were sacrificed prematurely. However, this seems to be due to the increased survival in high 
dose animals. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
A  complete  battery  of  reproductive  toxicity  studies  was  conducted  with  lomitapide.  All  pivotal 
studies were conducted in compliance with GLP regulations, were adequately designed, and met 
ICH  guidelines  (ICH  S5[R2],  Detection  of  Toxicity  to  Reproduction  for  Medicinal  Products  and 
Toxicity to Male Fertility, November 2005). Dose/exposure multiples relative to a 60-mg dose in 
humans  were  estimated  using  either  existing  data  from  toxicology  studies  in  non-pregnant  rats 
or calculated using body-surface area in rabbits. 
Overall, there were no major effects on fertility in male or female rats treated with lomitapide. In 
rats,  malformations  were  observed  in  various  organs,  also  at  lower  doses  than  the  maternally 
toxic dose. There is no safety margin for teratogenicity in rats. Supplementation with fat-soluble 
vitamins  did  not  protect  against  this  teratogenic  effect,  and  a  decrease  in  these  vitamins  in 
treated animals can therefore not be seen as the cause of malformations. The mechanism behind 
this  teratogenicity  and  therefore  its  relevance  for  humans  is  not  known.  However,  the  CHMP 
noted that there are adequate warnings in the SmPC not to use lomitapide during pregnancy and 
this was considered satisfactory for the use of lomitapide in the rare HoFH population. 
In  rabbits,  no  embryo-foetal  toxicity  was  seen  in  the  pivotal  study.  Since  no  toxicokinetic  data 
were available in rabbits, it is difficult to conclude whether in this study, rabbits were sufficiently 
exposed to lomitapide. In a preceding, range-finding study, increased resorption was observed at 
doses exceeding those tested in the pivotal study. In ferrets, maternal and embryo-foetal toxicity 
was  observed,  and  was  accompanied  by  increases  in  malformations  in  various  organs.  Due  to 
maternal toxicity, the relevance of this finding is difficult to interpret. The teratogenic effects are 
not  to  be  disregarded  and  appropriate  contraindication  for  the  use  of  lomitapide  during 
pregnancy was therefore introduced. The exposure to lomitapide in ferrets is unknown. 
In  the  pre-  and  postnatal  studies  in  rats  with  doses  up  to  1  mg/kg/day,  a  similar  pattern 
regarding  maternal  toxicity  and  decrease  litter  sizes  was  observed  as  in  the  rat  embryo-foetal 
study.  Additional  findings  include  a  very  slight  increased  duration  of  gestation,  increased  pup 
mortality and decreased viability index, and decreased pup weight. There is no safety margin for 
these effects. Maturation of the surviving offspring  was not affected. No off-spring studies were 
conducted  with  lomitapide  because  the  target  indication  for  this  MAA  is  limited  to  the  adult 
patient  population.    However,  as  agreed  in  the  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP),  a  juvenile 
toxicity study in rats prior to the implementation of a planned paediatric study will be conducted. 
Toxicokinetic data 
No  separate  toxicokinetic  studies  were  performed  in  animals,  but  the  toxicokinetic  profile  of 
lomitapide was investigated as part of the repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Assessment report  
Page 27/107 
 
  
  
 
Local Tolerance 
Local tolerance studies were not performed, since lomitapide is intended for oral administration. 
Other toxicity studies 
Several  additional  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  with  lomitapide  including  examination  of 
antigenicity,  immunotoxicity,  and  the  toxicological  profile  of  lomitapide’s  metabolites  and 
impurities.  Lomitapide  was  not  antigenic  in  guinea  pigs.  No  direct  evidence  of  immunotoxicity 
was observed in the repeated dose studies or in the carcinogenicity studies. No adverse effect on 
phagocytic  activity  was  observed  in  macrophages  obtained  by  bronchoalveolar  lavage  of  lungs 
from rats treated with lomitapide for three months, with exposures up to approximately 20 times 
higher  than  the  human  exposure.  Two drug  substance  impurities  are  specified  above  the 
qualification  limit.  These  impurities  are  sufficiently  qualified.  Phototoxicity  was  not  investigated 
and  although  some  absorption  takes  place  above  290  nm,  this  is  considered  minor  and  no 
relevant phototoxicity is expected.

The  CHMP  noted  that  the  initially  provided  data  were  not  entirely  sufficient  and  thus,  did  not 
allow  for  a  definitive  conclusion  on  the  potential  risk  of  lomitapide  to  the  environment.  Upon 
CHMP’s  request  a  study  was  performed  to  determine  the  log  Kow  for  lomitapide;  however,  this 
study  did  not  meet  the  criteria  of  the  OECD  guidelines.  The  CHMP  recommended  that  the 
applicant provides the results and study report on the determination of the log Kow of lomitapide 
according to OECD guidelines during the post-phase. Considering the refined Fpen, it is observed 
that  the  PECsurfacewater  is  below  the  action  limit.  Epidemiological  data  have  been  provided  to 
support  the  refinement  of  Fpen.  Further  environmental  risk  assessment  of  this  issue  is  not 
necessary.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Lomitapide  is  a  new  lipid  lowering  agent  that  significantly  reduces  plasma  cholesterol  and 
triglycerides  in  several  animal  species.  Forthcoming  from  the  mechanism  of  action,  which  is 
inhibition of the assembly of lipoproteins and their release into the circulation, lipid accumulation 
is  observed  in  liver,  small  intestine  and  pancreas,  as  well  as  evidence  of  liver  toxicity.  Liver 
toxicity  remains  an  issue  of  concern.  Additional  non-clinical  data  are  however  not  expected  to 
add relevant information to what is already known. Clinical monitoring will be of importance (see 
section Clinical aspects). 
In  the  animal  studies,  no  correlation  was  observed  between  lipid  accumulation  and  tumour 
formation.  Potential  other  causes  of  the  observed  tumours  or  their  clinical  relevance  were  not 
discussed and this is accepted by the CHMP in view of the limited current indication to the small 
patient population  (patients  with  HoFH).  Lomitapide  showed  potential teratogenic  effects  in  two 
out  of  three  tested  animal  species;  however,  sufficient  exposure  in  the  species  in  which  no 
teratogenicity  was  found  could  not  be  obtained.  The  mechanism  behind  this  teratogenicity  and 
therefore its relevance for humans is not known and therefore, no firm conclusions can be made. 
The risk of teratogenicity observed in the nonclinical setting has been reflected in the RMP and in 
the  Educational  material  for  prescribers  and  the  use  of  lomitapide  in  pregnancy  is 
contraindicated.      Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  the  non-clinical  profile  of  Lojuxta  to  be  well 
characterised considering the indication for the restricted rare indication in HoFH patients in the 
EU.  A  post-authorisation  commitment  in  the  area  of  eco-toxicity  has  been  acknowledged  and 
agreed by the CHMP.    
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  CHMP  considered  that  in  general,  the  non-clinical  studies  conducted  with  Lojuxta  were 
sufficient and provide a good overview of the product’s non-clinical profile. All CHMP's questions 
raised  during  the  assessment  were  addressed  either  by  means  of  submitting  additional  data, 
proposing risk minimisation measures, or agreeing to post-authorisation measures, e.g. conduct 
of  addition  eco-toxicity  testing.  Thus,  the  CHMP  considered  the  non-clinical  development 
satisfactory. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical programme for Lojuxta included fifteen phase 1 studies, seven phase 2 studies and 
three phase 3 studies (see table below). Of these, two studies are still on-going. In total, 1145 
healthy  subjects  and  patients  were  treated,  including  943  who  received  lomitapide,  either  as 
monotherapy  or  co-administered  with  other  lipid  lowering  therapy.  The  majority  of  subjects 
(959 out of 1145) were enrolled in placebo and/or active-controlled trials.

The pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) of lomitapide was initially investigated in single 
and multiple fixed dose monotherapy studies. Subsequently, in five phase II studies, dose finding 
was performed when lomitapide was administered concomitantly with other lipid lowering agents 
(atorvastatin or  ezetimibe)  in  hypercholesterolemic patients  (also the  LDL-C  elevated  and other 
CV  risk  factor  study  pool).    Dose  escalation  was  tested  in  a  proof  of  concept study  in  six  HoFH 
patients. Subsequently, a pivotal study in HoFH patients (n=29) was performed. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  PK  of  lomitapide  was  evaluated  in  individual  studies  using  non-compartmental  methods.  In 
selected  studies,  preliminary  PK/PD  analyses  were  completed.  The  analytical  methods  in  PK 
studies  were  sufficiently  validated  and  are  consistent  with 
the  current 
regulatory 
recommendations. 
Assessment report

Absorption  
After oral administration, lomitapide has an absolute bioavailability of 7%. The concentrations of 
its  metabolites  were  lower  following  IV  administration  than  following  oral  administration.  The 
permeability  tests  with  Caco-2  cell  monolayers  indicate  that  lomitapide  can  be  classified  as 
having a  high absorption potential. An important food effect was also observed, since both, the 
low-  and  high-fat  breakfasts  produced  statistically  significant  increases  in  Cmax  and  AUC0-t  of 
lomitapide  when  compared  to  the  fasted  group.  However,  food  intake  did  not  affect  the  tmax 
values.  After  a  low  fat  breakfast,  the  bioavailability  and  Cmax  of  lomitapide  were  increased  by 
30% and 70% respectively and after a high fat breakfast by 60% and 80% respectively.  
The  qualitative  composition  of  lomitapide  was  not  changed  during  the  course  of  development. 
However,  the  formulations  varied  with  respect  to  micronisation  grade  and  percentage  of 
polymorphous forms. The commercial available lomitapide 10mg capsules were not studied in the 
clinical trials. A justification was provided and was based on comparative dissolution of the 5 mg 
and  20  mg  capsules.  This  is  in  line  with  the  requirements  for  biowaivers  as  per  the  CHMP 
guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence.  
Distribution 
Lomitapide  has  a  high  volume  of  distribution  of  approximately  1300  litre  and  a  high  degree  of 
protein binding (>99.5%). In the ADME trial, no covalent binding of lomitapide or its metabolites 
to  plasma  proteins  was  observed.  Lomitapide  appears  to  be  loosely  bound  to  plasma  proteins 
and this protein binding does not affect its distribution. Protein binding was unchanged in plasma 
samples from subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD).  Small but significant differences in 
protein  binding  were  noted  between  matched  controls  and  subjects  with  moderately  impaired 
hepatic function, but these do not appear to be of clinical significance. 
Elimination 
The  apparent  elimination  half-life  of  lomitapide  following  IV  administration  was  24  hours, 
following  oral  administration  about  49  hours.  In  the  ADME  studies  it  was  shown  that 
approximately  35%  of  the  total  lomitapide  dose  is  excreted  via  urine  and  60%  via  faeces. 
Approximately  5%  of  the  administered  dose  of  lomitapide  was  excreted  unchanged  with  the 
faeces,  no  unchanged  lomitapide  was  detected  via  radio  profiling  in  the  urine  samples. 
Metabolism of lomitapide was evaluated in two in vitro studies and two human ADME studies. In 
vitro data showed that lomitapide is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4, but also by CYP2E1. Other 
CYP  enzymes  are  also  involved.  Several  metabolites  have  been  identified  in  human  plasma.  Of 
these,  BMS-203215  (M1),  BMS-203304  (M3)  and  BMS-224433  (M2)  have  been  determined  in 
most pharmacokinetic trials. The  M3 is the most abundant metabolite; its plasma concentration 
is  approximately  15–fold higher  than  that  of  the  parent  drug.  The  metabolic  activity  of  M3  was 
estimated  to  be  several  hundred  times  less  than  of  lomitapide.  The  IC50  for  lomitapide  was 
determined  to  be  15.5  nM  compared  to  6.3  µM  for  M3.  Nevertheless,  the  potential  role  of  this 
major circulating metabolite M3 in the pharmacological effect of lomitapide is not clear because 
its plasma protein binding is unknown and the potential for accumulation of M3 in the liver is not 
understood.

As determined in two dose-ranging studies, lomitapide displays linear PK in the dose range of 10-
50mg.  At  higher  dose  levels  (100mg  and  200mg),  a  more  than  proportional  increase  of 
lomitapide and a less than proportional increase of the metabolite M1 were observed. At steady 
state, the accumulation of lomitapide was 2.7 for the 25mg dose and 3.9 for the 50mg dose. A 
dose proportional reduction in LDL-C levels was also observed after multiple dosing. Lomitapide 
has an inter-individual variability of approximately 50% PK in the target population.  
Special populations 
The exposure to lomitapide is increased by approximately 40% in subjects with end stage renal 
disease  (ESRD)  on  haemodialysis.  No  full  renal  impairment  study  was  conducted;  subjects  with 
mild  and  moderate  renal  impairment  were  excluded  from  clinical  trials.  The  exposure  to 
lomitapide  in  subjects  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  was  somewhat  higher  (40%)  than  in  the 
matched  healthy  subjects,  and  was  approximately  3-fold  increased  in  subjects  with  moderate 
hepatic impairment compared to matched controls. 
A  dedicated  PK  population  study  was  not  conducted,  but  a  population  PK  analysis  (AEGR-
733PC0028) limited to covariates of race, body mass index (BMI), gender, weight, and age, was 
performed.  For  the  development  of  the  a  PK  population  model,  PK  results  of  study  CV145-001, 
CV145-002  and  CV145-003,  and  PK  data  of  66  healthy  subjects  were  included.  All  subjects 
received  a  single  dose  of  lomitapide  IV  7.5,  15,  30,  and  60  mg  and/or  lomitapide  oral    25,  50, 
100, and 200 mg. A non-linear mixed effect modelling approach was applied. The final PK model 
was  a  three  compartment  model,  based  on  which  it  can  be  concluded  that  lomitapide  displays 
linear  pharmacokinetics  in  the  dose  range  of  10-50  mg  after  oral  administration.  The  linear 
model  underestimates  the  bioavailability  of  higher  doses  (100  and  200mg)  of  lomitapide. 
Although  the  studied  covariates  do  not  appear  to  affect  the  PK  of  lomitapide,  only  a  limited 
analysis  of  the  influence  of  these  variables  on  the  PK  of  lomitapide  was  conducted,  mainly 
focusing on the influence of age, weight and race on the PD parameters such as changes of LDL-
C by patient subgroups. At the 10 mg daily dose level there were no differences between males 
and  females,  at  the  25  mg  daily  dose  level,  females  had  1.9-fold  higher  AUC  values  for 
lomitapide as compared to males.  
No elderly subjects aged >75 were included in any study. A limited number of patients (N=97) of 
≥ 65-74 were included in the phase 2 trials, however, no elderly HoFH patients were included. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The  potential  for  drug  interactions  was  evaluated  in  seven  in  vitro  studies  and  five  in  vivo 
studies. 
In vitro studies 
In  vitro  tests  showed  that  CYP3A4  plays  a  major  role  in  phase  I  metabolism  of  lomitapide.  In 
addition,  CYP2E1  might  also  contribute  to  a  smaller  degree.  Lomitapide  is  a  direct  inhibitor  of 
CYPs 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 with IC50 values of 24.3 μg/mL, 47.2 μg/mL, 43.0 μg/mL, 
4.16  μg/mL  and  7.63/5.55  μg/mL,  respectively.  Time-dependent  inhibition  by  lomitapide  was 
found for these CYPs with IC50 values of 6.94 μg/mL, 38.1 μg/mL, 44.4 μg/mL, 6.94μg/mL and 
4.86/2.77  μg/mL,  respectively.  The  CYP1A2  ,  CYP2E1  and  CYP2C8  activities  were  not  inhibited. 
Further  investigations  of  the  CYP  2D6  and  3A4  inhibition  showed  that  at  higher  lomitapide 
concentrations  the  inhibition  was  greater  than  predicted  on  the  inhibition  observed  at  lower

concentrations,  indicating  a  non-linear  inhibition.  Based  on  these  in  vitro  results,  no  direct 
problems  would be  expected  after  the  first  pass  effect  as  all  IC50  values  are much  higher  than 
the clinical steady-state Cmax (5.5 ng/mL) when the extensive protein binding (> 99%) is taken 
into  account.  Lomitapide  showed  no  induction  potential  for  CYP1A2,  CYP3A4,  and  CYP2B6 
activities. 
The  metabolite  M1  had  no  inhibitory  potential  for  CYP2A6,  2B6,  2C8,  2C9,  2E1  or  3A4  and  a 
modest  inhibition  was  observed  on  CYP2C19  and  CYP2D6.  Metabolite  M3  showed  some  time 
dependent  inhibition  of  CYP2C8.  Both,  M1,  and  M3,  showed  no  induction  potential  for  CYP1A2, 
CYP3A4, and CYP2B6 activities.  
In vitro tests showed that lomitapide is an inhibitor of the P-gp function at the high concentration 
tested (6 µg/mL). No inhibition of the efflux transporter BCRP was also observed. No inhibition of 
the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1 and the renal transporters  OAT3, 
OAT1 and OCT2 was detected. 
In vivo studies 
The in vivo interaction study with the strong CyP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily 
for 5 days) and lomitapide (single dose) showed that lomitapide Cmax and AUC were increased 
by 15-fold and 27-fold, respectively. Lomitapide had no effect on the PK of ethinyl estradiol and 
norgestimate,  the  components  of  a  typical oestrogen-containing  oral  contraceptive  Orthocyclen. 
The weak-CYP3A4 inhibitor ethinyl estradiol did not affect the lomitapide PK. 
The  physiologically-based  pharmacokinetic  (PBPK)  model  to  predict  the  impact  of  an  array  of 
CYP3A4 inhibitors on the concentration time profile of lomitapide was used to predict the impact 
of weak, moderate, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors on lomitapide’s PK. Both, strong and moderate 
CYP3A4  inhibitors,  are  predicted  to  have  a  substantial  impact  on  lomitapide’s  PK  (mean  AUC 
ratios >5). The weak inhibitors used in the simulations had no major effect on the lomitapide PK, 
although the model was insufficiently validated for definitive conclusions.  
When 60 mg lomitapide was administered for five days prior to simvastatin 40 mg, simvastatin 
acid  AUC  and  Cmax  increased  by  71%  and  57%,  respectively.  The  effect  of  the  weak  CYP3A4 
inhibitor simvastatin on the PK of lomitapide was not evaluated in an interaction study. When 60 
mg lomitapide was administered for five days prior to atorvastatin 20 mg, atorvastatin acid AUC 
and Cmax increased with 49% and 38%, respectively. When 60 mg lomitapide was administered 
for  five  days  prior  to  rosuvastatin  20  mg,  a  modest  change  in  rosuvastatin  PK  parameters  was 
observed,  although  rosuvastatin  is  not  metabolized  by  CYP3A4.  Rosuvastatin  tmax  increased 
from 1 to 4 hours, AUC increased 45%, but Cmax was unchanged. The PK of other cholesterol-
lowering  drugs  not  metabolised  by  CYP3A4  were  generally  unaffected  by  lomitapide.  No  drug 
interaction study of lomitapide with bile acid sequestrants was performed. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Several in vitro studies were conducted using human biomaterial and their results are described 
in above sections. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Assessment report  
Page 34/107 
 
  
  
 
Lomitapide  has  a  novel  mechanism  of  action,  targeting  microsomal  triglyceride  transfer  protein 
(MTP), which is involved in the assembly of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as chylomicrons in 
the  intestine  and  VLDL  in  the  liver.  Deficiency  of  MTP  has  been  reported  to  be  associated  with 
very  low  levels  of  LDL-C.  Therefore,  inhibiting  MTP  is  considered  a  valid  target  to  effectively 
lower LDL-C, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and is accepted as 
a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Of note, the mechanism of action of lomitapide is 
independent from the function of LDL receptor, which is defective in HoFH patients. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Lomitapide is an MTP inhibitor targeting apolipoprotein B synthesis. In humans, apo B-100 is the 
principal apolipoprotein associated with VLDL, IDL and LDL. The PD of lomitapide was evaluated 
as part of four PK/tolerability studies in healthy volunteers and one drug-drug interaction study. 
A  thorough  QT  study  was  also  conducted  in  order  to  assess  the  effect  of  lomitapide  on  QT 
interval. Lomitapide primary PD assessment concerns its effect on lipid parameters such as LDL-
C and total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, VLDL-C, triglycerides and apo B. 
In the first-in-man study BMS-CV145-001, single doses ranging from 1 to 200 mg showed a dose 
response  for  percent  change  in  LDL-C  from  baseline  at  doses  of  50  mg  and  higher;  the  LDL-C 
decreased in 24 hours and the effect was maintained through to 72 hours. TC and apo B showed 
a similar pattern. At doses of ≥25 mg there were dose-related decreases in triglycerides, with a 
maximal effect generally seen at 8 hours. Study BMS-CV145-003 single IV doses of lomitapide of 
7.5,  15,  30,  or  60  mg  showed  a  transient  increase  in  total  cholesterol,  HDL-C  and  LDL-C 
following  the  intravenous  doses  for  a  12-hour  period  after  which  the  plasma  concentrations 
decreased. By 48 hours, there was a profound cholesterol-lowering effect apparent at the highest 
dose that persisted throughout the 72-hour sampling period and a corresponding decrease in the 
apo B levels.  There was a significant triglyceride-lowering effect that persisted post-dose for at 
least  4  hours,  and  at  the  highest  dose,  this  persisted  to  at  least  48  hours  post-dose.  In  study 
BMS-CV145-002  lomitapide  doses  of  10,  25,  50  and  100  lomitapide  or  placebo  were 
administered once daily for 14 days in hypercholesterolaemic males. Subjects in the 10, 25, and 
50  mg  dose  cohorts  received  14  days  of  dosing  as  planned;  dosing  in  the  100  mg  dose  group 
was stopped after Day 7 in all subjects due to GI AEs and an initially planned 200 mg dose level 
was  not  evaluated.  Decreases  from  baseline  in  LDL-C  were  dose  dependent  with  maximal 
decreases  noted  between  Days  8  and  11.  The  patterns  were  similar  for  the  other  lipid 
parameters. 
In  the  BMS-CV145-010  trial,  healthy  female  subjects  were  randomised  to  10  mg  or  25  mg  of 
lomitapide  daily  or  matched  placebo  for  14  days.  Fasting  triglycerides  on day  14  decreased  by 
almost  50%  in  comparison  to  baseline  on  25  mg  and  18%  on 10  mg  QD  (placebo  -10%). 
Following  a  2  week  treatment,  the  mean  LDL-C  at  10  mg  dose  was  -41%  and  at  25  mg  -78% 
(placebo  -3%).  These  decreases  remained  relatively  stable  throughout  the  24  hr sampling  time 
at  the  end  of  the  study. The  decreases  in  lipid  values  in  females  at  the  25  mg  dose  were 
generally higher than those seen in males receiving 25 mg in clinical study BMS-CV145-002.  
In the AEGR-733-002 drug-drug interaction study 10 and 60 mg lomitapide was co-administered 
with other lipid-lowering drugs. Although in the absence of a lomitapide only arm the assessment 
of PD is not feasible, the comparison of the possible additive effects of lomitapide 10mg vs 60mg 
in  those  groups  of  patients  who  received  it  over  20mg  atorvastatin  or  20mg  rosuvastatin 
Assessment report  
Page 35/107 
 
  
  
 
suggests a dose dependent effect.  For LDL-C, after 8 days of treatment with 60 mg lomitapide, 
co-administration  of  20  mg  atorvastatin  or  20  mg  rosuvastatin  achieved  a  mean  percent 
reduction from baseline of -66.02% and -63.20%, respectively whereas the 10 mg dose with the 
same amount of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin achieved  a mean percent reduction of -30.99% and 
-41.74%  respectively.  Apo  B  and  total  cholesterol  changes  from  baseline  showed  a  similar 
pattern.  The  effect  was  less  clear  for  triglycerides  and  VLDL.  HDL-C  showed  a  consistent 
decrease from baseline with both low and high lomitapide doses. 
The  proof-of-concept  UP1001  Phase  2  single-arm,  open-label  study  without  background  lipid 
lowering  therapy  conducted  in  6  patients  with  HoFH  showed  LDL-C  reduction  after  16  weeks  of 
dose-escalating  lomitapide  treatment.  Other  lipid  and  lipoprotein  parameters,  including  TC, 
triglycerides, and VLDL-C concentrations, as well as changes from baseline in plasma lipoproteins 
were  also  evaluated.  Subjects  followed  a  rigorous  low-fat  diet  (<10%  of  energy  from  total 
dietary fat) and were provided a standard multivitamin supplement. A dose dependent reduction 
in  LDL-C  was observed  (see table  below).  This  was also  shown  for  TC,  TG,  apoB,  non-HDL,  but 
not for the other parameters VLDL-C, Lp(a), HDL-C and apo A1. After 4 weeks dose withdrawal, 
LDL-C levels returned to baseline. 
Mean  (sd)  percent  change  from  baseline  in  lipids  following  28  days  of  dosing  at  0.03,  0.1,  0.3 
and 1.0 mg/kg lomitapide (n=6) 
Secondary  pharmacology  was  investigated  in  one  study  AEGR-733-011,  a  thorough  QT  study 
that examined the effect of single 75 and 200 mg doses of lomitapide (in solution) alone, as well 
as 75 mg lomitapide (in solution) co-administered with ketoconazole 200mg twice daily, in order 
to  achieve  supratherapeutic  exposure  on  QT  interval  in  56  healthy  male  and  female  subjects. 
Moxifloxacin 400mg was used as a positive control for the QT assessment.  The  Cmax and AUC0-t 
values  increased  in  a  greater  than  dose  proportional  manner,  co-administration  of  75  mg 
lomitapide  with  ketoconazole  markedly  increased  exposure  to  lomitapide.  Lomitapide  did  not 
affect heart rate, but single doses of 75 and 200 mg caused minor changes from baseline in the 
QT  interval  corrected  for  heart  rate  using  the  individualized  formula  (ΔQTcI),  whereas 
moxifloxacin and ketoconazole (alone or co-administered with lomitapide) caused an increase of 
ΔQTcI  with  a  peak  effect  at  3  hours  post-dose.  The  largest  mean  placebo-corrected  ΔQTcI 
(ΔΔQTcI) following administration of 75 or 200 mg lomitapide alone did not exceed 3ms at any 
Assessment report  
Page 36/107 
 
  
  
 
 
 
time point, thus an effect exceeding 4.7 ms could be confidently excluded. When adjusted for the 
effect of ketoconazole, 75 mg lomitapide caused a maximum mean ΔΔQTcI effect of 2.3 ms, and 
the upper bound of the 90% CI did not exceed 4.4 ms. The ΔΔQTcI after administration of 400 
mg moxifloxacin was up to 12.4 ms, confirming the study’s ability to detect a small QTc effect. 
The  analysis  of  Fridericia  corrected  QT  (QTcF)  was  entirely  consistent  with  that  of  QTcI.    The 
concentration  effect  analysis  demonstrated  a  significant,  very  shallow  slope  for  the  relation 
between lomitapide plasma levels and ΔΔQTcI. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Lomitapide  has  a  low  absolute  bioavailability  of  7%  after  oral  administration.  The  low 
bioavailability is at least partly due to a high first-pass effect and not to poor intrinsic absorption. 
Lomitapide  is  extensively  and  primarily  metabolised  by  CYP3A4,  but  CYP2E1  and  other  CYP 
enzymes are also involved. In an interaction study with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 
a  27-fold  increase  of  the  lomitapide  exposure  was  found.  Based  on  in  vitro  findings  and  the 
ketoconazole  drug-drug  interaction  study  concomitant  use  of  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors  is 
contraindicated.  In  vivo  interaction  studies  with  mild  or  moderate  CYP  3A4  inhibitors  were  not 
conducted.  Based  on  the  magnitude  of  the  interaction  with  the  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor 
ketoconazole,  other  strong  and  moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitors  are  expected  to  have  a  substantial 
impact on lomitapide’s PK. Therefore, the use of moderate and strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as 
itraconazole, 
fluconazole, 
ketoconazole, 
voriconazole, 
posaconazole, 
erythromycin, 
clarithromycin, telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, diltiazem or verapamil, is contraindicated, 
as adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Weak  CYP3A4  inhibitors  are  predicted  to  have  a  substantial  impact  on  lomitapide’s  PK.  A  4-10 
fold increase of lomitapide exposure can be expected based on the results of the study with the 
strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor  ketoconazole  and  on  historical  data  for  the  model  CYP3A4  probe 
midazolam.  As  lomitapide  is  likely  to  be  co-administered  with  weak  CYP3A  inhibitors,  such  as 
simvastatin,  atorvastatin  or  oral  contraceptives,  the  CHMP  considered  necessary  that  the  SmPC 
contains an adequate advice the treating physicians on their concomitant use with lomitapide. In 
case  of  a  5  mg  starting  dose,  a  careful  up-titration  of  lomitapide  is  recommended  when  it  is 
added to a weak CYP 3A4 inhibitor. When a weak CYP 3A4 inhibitor is added to lomitapide, dose 
reduction of lomitapide is recommended, followed by careful up-titration, to assure the safe use 
of  lomitapide.  In  addition,  the  applicant  committed  to  conduct  post-approval  drug-drug 
interaction  studies  with  the  weak  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (atorvastatin  and  oral  contraceptive 
containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate). The study with atorvastatine will be conducted at 
the highest approved dose atorvastatine to mimic the worst case clinical situation. Dose spacing 
in time will also be evaluated. The concomitant use of compounds that induce CYP3A4 and inhibit 
or induce CYP2E1 may lead to drug-drug interactions with lomitapide, as they will influence the 
metabolism of lomitapide. 
The PBPK model was considered by the CHMP to be insufficiently validated at present to predict 
the  impact  of  other  weak,  moderate,  and  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors  on  lomitapide’s  PK,  but  the 
model  will  be  updated  with  the  additional  interaction  study  data.  As  the  model  is  updated,  the 
CHMP  advised  the  applicant  to  take  into  account  the  correct  computation  of  the  fraction  of  the 
dose of the capsule formulation that is absorbed into enterocytes, explanation of equation 7 and 
origin  of  data  included  in  the  computation,  method  of  estimation  of  and  estimated  parameter

values  for  drug  distribution,  justification  and/or  sensitivity  analysis  for  assumed  B/P  ratio  of  1, 
justification of use of Ki in place of Km, given the multiple active binding sites of CYP3A4, method 
of active uptake into hepatocytes in the model, consideration of gut metabolism in the model. 
Lomitapide exhibits a significant food effect. The presence of fat in the food increases lomitapide 
exposure  and  decreases  the  gastrointestinal  tolerability.  In  the  pivotal  trial  UP1002,  patients 
were to take lomitapide at bedtime with a glass of water, in order to separate the administration 
of lomitapide from the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. The CHMP considered this to 
be an adequate SmPC recommendation for timing relative to meals.  
The distribution and protein binding of lomitapide were sufficiently characterised. Lomitapide has 
a  high  volume  of  distribution  of  approximately  1300  L  and  a  high  degree  of  protein  binding 
>99.5%.  In  animal  studies,  lomitapide  was  shown  to  be  highly  concentrated  (200-fold)  in  the 
liver and as the main site of action is in the liver , it is viewed as important to understand if the 
drug  is  also  concentrated  in  the  liver  in  humans.  Thus,  the  applicant  will  conduct  in  vitro 
investigations  to  evaluate  if  lomitapide  is  actively  or  passively  transported  into  the  liver. 
Lomitapide also seems to be loosely bound to the plasma proteins and protein binding does not 
affect  the  distribution  of  lomitapide.  Several  metabolites  were  identified  in  human  plasma,  i.e. 
M1, M2 and M3. The M3 metabolite is most abundant, with plasma concentration approximately 
15–fold higher than that of the parent drug. Although the metabolic activity of M3 was estimated 
to be considerably lower than that of lomitapide, its potential role in the pharmacological effect of 
lomitapide is not defined and further investigations are considered necessary by the CHMP. Thus, 
in vitro studies will be conducted in the post-authorisation phase. The elimination of lomitapide is 
sufficiently  characterised.  Lomitapide  has  a  half-life  of  approximately  49  hours  following  oral 
administration;  approximately  35%  of  the  total  lomitapide  dose  was  excreted  in  the  urine  and 
60%  in  faeces.  Around  5%  of  the  lomitapide  dose  was  excreted  unchanged  via  the  faeces,  no 
unchanged lomitapide was found in the urine.  
Based  on  the  results  of  two  dose  ranging  studies  it  can  be  concluded  that  lomitapide  displays 
linear  PK  in  the  dose  range  of  10-50  mg.  At  higher  dose  levels  (100  and  200mg)  a  more  than 
proportional  increase  of  lomitapide  and  a  less  than  proportional  increase  of  the  metabolite  M1 
and M3 were observed. Although 60 mg is above the linear range, it is only slightly higher and 
patients will be titrated to this dose; thus linearity can be accepted above the linear dose range. 
Lomitapide  has  an  inter-individual  variability  of  approximately  50%.  Based  on  the  currently 
available  data,  the  intra-individual  variability  cannot  be  estimated  and  this  is  considered 
acceptable. Sparse PK data in the HoFH patients were collected and included in a population PK 
analysis.  It  was  possible  to  predict  the  lomitapide  trough  concentrations  in  the  HoFH  patient 
population 
reasonably  well.  Simulation  slightly  underestimated 
the  observed 
trough 
concentrations  by  a  factor  of  about  1.3.  This  underestimation is  attributed  to  the  differences  in 
the BMI between healthy volunteers and HoFH patients and the fact that concentrations obtained 
from the sparse sampling in the Phase III study were not real trough concentrations.  
The  exposure  to  lomitapide  is  increased  by  approximately  40%  in  subjects  with  ESRD  on 
haemodialysis.  Although  the  SmPC  recommends  adjusting  the  lomitapide  dose  over  time,  the 
CHMP  considered  it  necessary  that  patients  with  ESRD  receiving  dialysis  should  not  exceed  40 
mg  daily.  An  adequate  advice  was  included  in  the  SmPC.  The  exposure  to  lomitapide  was 
increased by 40% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and a 3-fold increase was found in in 
subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  Irrespective  of  the  PK  data,  lomitapide  is 
Assessment report  
Page 38/107 
 
  
  
 
contraindicated  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment  due  to  safety  reasons; 
therefore no additional data are required in this sub-population. 
The influence of age, weight and race on the PK of lomitapide were evaluated in a population PK 
analysis using the PK results of three phase 1 studies. The population PK database was small (66 
subjects)  and  homogenous  due  to  the  in-  and  exclusion  criteria  of  the  studies.  A  full  set  of 
demographic data in the population PK study was not provided and the covariate model building 
steps  were  not  justified.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  recommended  a  conduct  of  a  more  extensive 
population  PK  analysis,  which  takes  other  variables  into  account.  This  will  be  provided  post-
authorisation.  
In the in vitro tests lomitapide slightly inhibited CYP 3A4 and several other CYP enzymes. Based 
on  these  results,  no  direct  consequences  would  be  expected  after  the  first pass  effect,  since  all 
IC50  values  were  much  higher  than  the  clinical  steady-state.  The  interaction  of  lomitapide  and 
statins was evaluated and a significant interaction with simvastatine (a CYP3A4 substrate) during 
concomitant  use.  Considerable  increase  of  atorvastatin  and  a  modest  increase  of  rosuvastatin 
exposure  were  observed  after  concomitant  administration  with  lomitapide.  Although  the 
mechanism  of  interaction  with  statins  is  not  entirely  clear  at  the  time,  it  can  be  adequately 
managed by taking into account the CHMP recommendations in the SmPC, i.e. contraindication of 
the  80mg  dose of  simvastatin,  and  warning  that  lomitapide  can increase  plasma  concentrations 
of  statins  and  patients  receiving  this  combination  should  be  monitored  for  adverse  events 
(including the muscular and liver adverse events). The PK of other cholesterol-lowering drugs not 
metabolised by CYP3A4 was generally unaffected by co-administration of lomitapide.  
The results of in vitro tests also showed that lomitapide is an inhibitor of the P-gp function and 
thus,  may  potentially  cause  a  drug  interaction  with P-gp  substrates.  An in  vivo  drug interaction 
study  was  not  conducted.  Since  the  most  relevant  P-gp  substrates  will  rarely  be  used  in  the 
relatively  young  HoFH  population,  the  CHMP  considered  it  sufficient  to  inform  the  treating 
physician  of  this  potential  interaction  via  the  SmPC.  The  interaction  with  Pgp-substrates  is  also 
addressed in the risk management plan. Lomitapide had no effect on the PK of the components 
of  an  oestrogen-containing  oral  contraceptive.  Lomitapide  increased  warfarin  INRmax  and  the 
exposure  to  warfarin.  This  interaction  is  sufficiently  reflected  in  the  SmPC,  since  a 
recommendation to monitor the INR before starting lomitapide and regularly after the treatment 
start is included in the SmPC. As per the CHMP request, this was extended to all coumarin based 
anticoagulants.  
Regarding the PD investigations, reduction in LDL-C concentrations was clearly demonstrated in 
hypercholesterolemic  patients  after  single  and  multiple  dose.  Although  data  of  the  proof-of-
concept study in HoFH (n=6) are not easy to interpret due to the very low number of patients, 
open-label  nature  and  non-placebo  controlled  data,  they  can  be  further  supported  by  the  dose 
finding and main pivotal studies. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Lomitapide is a new compound with a novel mechanism of action. It is well absorbed but with 
low  bioavailability  due  to  extensive  first  pass  metabolism,  highly  bound  to  human  plasma 
proteins,  eliminated  mainly  by  metabolism,  and  potential  for  significant  drug  interactions. 
Although  the  available  data  allow 
for  understanding  of  the  main  pharmacokinetic 
Assessment report

characteristics, there are a number of issues that require further investigations. Therefore, the 
CHMP  considered  the  following  measures  necessary  to  address  the  clinical  pharmacology  of 
lomitapide: 
-  Conduct of clinical studies to further investigate the drug-drug interactions between 
lomitapide and the two weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, atorvastatin and oral contraceptives.  
The studies should evaluate the effect when co-administered (worst case) and when 
dosing is spaced in time. 
-  Validation of the mechanistic (PBPK) model to predict lomitapide interactions with 
CYP3A4 inhibitors using the data from the above studies and the interaction with 
ketoconazole. 
-  Depending  on  the  results  of  the  clinical  studies  and  the  reliability  of  the  mechanistic 
(PBPK) model of lomitapide, further clinical drug-drug interaction studies for commonly 
co-administered  drugs  (potentially  including  co-administration  of  two  weak  CYP3A4 
inhibitors) or further modelling work may be needed. 
-  Conduct of in vitro studies to determine whether lomitapide and its active metabolite M3 
are  transported  into  the  liver  and  if  so,  to  identify  the  hepatic  uptake  transporters 
involved  using  clinically  relevant  concentrations  of  lomitapide  and  M3  (also  taking  into 
account protein binding). 
-  A more extensive population PK analysis to study the other potentially relevant 
covariates, such as gender is needed. 
The applicant committed to conduct the above investigations in the post-authorisation phase. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The  clinical  trials  of  lomitapide  were  initiated  with  early  clinical  development  focusing  on 
treatment  of  hypercholesterolaemia  with  lomitapide  monotherapy  administered  at  fixed  daily 
doses.  Study  UP1001,  a  phase  2  single-arm  study  in  HoFH  patients  was  the  first  study  using 
dose  escalation,  i.e.  initiating  lomitapide  at  a  low  dose  (0.03  mg/kg)  with  escalation  to  higher 
doses  every  4  weeks  (0.1  mg/kg,  0.3  mg/kg  and  1.0  mg/kg,  respectively).  This  study  also 
introduced  a  rigorous  low-fat  diet  (containing  <10%  energy  from  fat),  which  resulted  in  a 
substantially  improved  tolerability  profile.  Based  on  the  results  observed  in  study  UP1001,  a 
Phase  3  study  UP1002  was  initiated  aiming  to  confirm  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  lomitapide  in 
HoFH. Additional sites of this study  were opened outside the US under protocol AEGR-733-005. 
Thus, UP1002/AEGR-733-005 is the pivotal study for the proposed indication in HoFH. 
The  clinical  development  programme  also  includes  four  randomised,  double  blind, placebo- 
and/or  active-controlled  (AEGR-733-001,  AEGR-733- 003b,  AEGR-733-004  and  AEGR- 733-006) 
studies  with  lomitapide  at  doses  ranging  from  2.5 to 10  mg  daily  administered  as  monotherapy 
and/or  co-administered  with  other  lipid-lowering therapies  in  subjects  with  elevated  LDL-C. 
Phase  2  study  BMS-CV145-009  evaluating  the  safety  and  pharmacodynamics  of lomitapide 
administered at a dose of 25 mg once daily for 4 weeks in subjects with elevated LDL-C was also 
conducted. The on-going study AEGR-733-012 is an extension of the pivotal UP1002/AEGR-733-
005 trial and evaluates the long-term efficacy and safety of lomitapide at the maximum tolerated

dose established during study UP1002/AEGR-733-005 in HoFH patients. The below table provides 
an  overview  of  these  clinical  trials  as  submitted  for  the  originally  applied  indication  for 
lomitapide: 
Lomitapide  is  indicated  as  an  adjunct  to  a  low-fat  diet  and  other  lipid-lowering  drugs  with  or 
without  LDL  apheresis  to  reduce  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (LDL-C),  total  cholesterol 
(TC),  apolipoprotein  B  (apo B)  and  triglycerides  (TG)  in  patients  with  homozygous  familial 
hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). The effect of lomitapide on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
has not been determined.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No  specific  dose  response  study  was  conducted.  In  phase  2  studies,  the  dose  response  of 
lomitapide  as  a  mono-component  or  combined  with  other  lipid  lowering  therapy  (placebo 
controlled) was evaluated as shown in the table below after 8 weeks of treatment. The following 
phase  2  studies  were  randomised,  double-blind,  active-controlled,  parallel-group  studies  in 
patients  with  moderate  hypercholesterolemia,  excluding  HoFH  patients:  Study  AEGR-733-001 
(lomitapide+ezetimibe  vs  lomitapide),  study  AEGR-733-003  (lomitapide+atorvastatin  20  mg  vs 
monotherapy), and study AEGR-733-006 (lomitapide+atorvastatin 20 mg vs atorvastatin). 
Adding  atorvastatin  or  ezetimibe  to  lomitapide  resulted  in  further  reduction  of  LDL-C  with,  no 
difference between adding atorvastatin to the lower and higher lomitapide dose, as shown in the 
table below.  
In Phase 2 study UP1001 in HoFH patients, escalating dose titration was used based primarily on 
the observed poor GI tolerability in the hypercholesterolemic patient population. The mean doses 
administered every 4 weeks were 2.0, 6.7, 20.1, and 67.0 mg/day. The lipid-lowering effect was 
minimal after the first 4 weeks at a mean dose of 2 mg and the dose was well tolerated. Thus, 
the  starting  dose  for  the  subsequent  Phase  3  trial  UP1002/AEGR-733-005  was  decided  to  be  5 
mg for the first two weeks and this was expected to lead to reduced GI side effects.

2.5.2.  Main study 
Title of Study 
Study UP1002/AEGR-733-005: A Phase III Study of Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein 
(MTP) Inhibitor AEGR-733 in Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia on Current 
Lipid-lowering Therapy. 
The  clinical  trial  UP1002/AEGR-733-005  is  considered  the  main  pivotal  study  supporting  the 
claimed indication for lomitapide. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
In the study UP1002/AEGR-733-005, men and women 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis 
of functional HoFH by at least one of the following genetic or clinical criteria were eligible: 
-  Documented functional mutation(s) in both LDL-R alleles or alleles known to affect LDL-R 
functionality, or 
- 
Skin fibroblast LDL-R activity <20% normal, or 
-  Untreated  TC  >500  mg/dL  and  triglycerides  <300  mg/dL  and  both  parents  with 
documented untreated TC >250 mg/dL. 
Genetic information was available for all 29 subjects in the trial. Twenty-eight of 29 patients had 
defects  in  the  LDLR  gene  and  1  patient  had  ARH,  which  is  attributed  to  defects  in  the  LDLR 
adaptor  protein.  Seven  subjects  also  had  skin  fibroblast  LDL-R  activity  <20% of  normal  and 11 
had  evidence  of  untreated  TC  >500  mg/dL  and  triglycerides  <300  mg/dL  with  both  parents 
having documented untreated TC >250 mg/dL. Twenty five patients had documented mutations 
in each of 2 alleles, consistent with the diagnosis of HoFH. Among the 25 patients with 2 mutant 
LDLR  alleles  listed, 7  were  “true”  homozygotes,  i.e. exhibiting the  same  mutation  in  each  LDLR 
allele, and 18 were “compound” heterozygotes, i.e. exhibiting 2 different mutations at the LDLR 
locus. 
Main exclusion criteria included: 
- 
Several types of liver diseases 
-  History  of  biopsy-proven  cirrhosis  or  abnormal  liver  function  tests  (LFTs)  at  screening 
(AST  or  ALT  >2  x  upper  limit  of  normal  and/or  total  bilirubin  of  >1.5  mg/dL  (25.7 
μmol/L) unless patient has unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to Gilbert’s syndrome). 
-  Male  subjects  reporting  more  than  2  drinks  per  day  or  females  reporting  more  than  1 
drink per day (1 drink = 12 oz beer, 1 oz hard liquor, 5 oz wine). 
-  Chronic hepatitis B or C 
- 
Known significant GI bowel disease or malabsorption such as inflammatory bowel disease 
or chronic pancreatitis requiring use of daily pancreatic enzymes. 
-  Uncontrolled hypertension 
-  History of chronic renal insufficiency 
The CHMP considered the inclusion and exclusion criteria acceptable.

In study UP1002/AEGR-733-005, a dose escalating scheme with 4 weeks intervals was used for 
optimal  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  lomitapide,  especially  with  respect  to  the  GI  events.  Dose 
definition  in  the  study  was  based  on  the  efficacy  and  tolerability  experience  obtained  from  the 
small  phase  2  study  in  HoFH  patients.  Background  therapy  should  have  been  stable  during  6 
weeks prior to start of therapy and during the remainder of the 26 weeks until primary endpoint. 
Furthermore, patients should be on optimal background therapy. This is considered appropriate. 
Subjects  were  also  counselled  to  follow  a  diet  supplying  <20%  energy  from  fat  and  were 
instructed  to  take  dietary  supplements  of  vitamin  E  and  fatty  acids  throughout  the  study.  A 
schematic of the dosing regimen is provided in the figure below.

Objectives 
The  main  objective  of  the  study  UP1002/AEGR-733-005  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of 
lomitapide co-administered with other LLTs as defined by percent change from baseline in LDL-C 
after  26  weeks  of  treatment.  Furthermore,  percent  changes  from  baseline  of  other  lipid 
parameters,  such  as  TC,  non-HDL-C,  HDL-C,  triglycerides,  VLDL-C,  Lp(a),  HDL-C,  apo  AI,  and 
hsCRP  were  also  determined  in  order  to  assess  the  lipid-lowering  activity  of  lomitapide.  The 
efficacy  objectives  are  considered  appropriate  by  the  CHMP,  since  after  26  weeks,  the  effect  of 
lomitapide would have been established. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  percent  change  from  baseline  in  directly  measured  LDL-C  at  26 
weeks.  This  was  calculated  for  each  individual  patient  as  [100  x  (week  26  LDLC-  baseline  LDL-
C)/baseline  LDL-C].  For  patients  receiving  aphaeresis,  only  pre-aphaeresis  LDL-C  levels  were 
used in the analyses. For the baseline value LDL-C levels from visits 2 and 3 (Week -2 and Week 
0), obtained before initiation of the therapy, were averaged.   
Secondary  endpoints  was  the  mean  percent  change  of  TC,  non-HDL,  ApoB,  TG,  VLDL-C,  and 
Lp(a)  at  26  weeks.  Exploratory  efficacy  variables  included  the  mean  percent  change  of  the 
calculated LDL-C values at each visit, HSL-C, TC/HDL-C ratio, hs-CRP and ApoAI.  
Sample size 
Assessment report  
Page 44/107 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The assumptions of 25% change in LDL-C with a 30% standard deviation and 15% dropout rate 
were used to calculate the sample size in study UP1002/AEGR-733-005. Applying an alpha value 
of 0.05 with intended 90% study power, 20 subjects were needed. In order to adequately assess 
safety, up to 25 subjects were to be enrolled. Eventually 29 patients were included in the pivotal 
study. 
Randomisation 
There  was  no  randomisation  in  study  UP1002/AEGR-733-005  since  this  was  a  single  arm  study 
and all patients who met entry criteria were assigned to receive lomitapide. 
Blinding (masking) 
The pivotal study UP1002/AEGR-733-005 was an open-label study, no blinding was carried out.  
Statistical methods 
Efficacy was assessed primarily in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all subjects 
who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  lomitapide  and  had  at  least  1  post-baseline  lipid  profile. 
Secondary  populations  for  evaluation  of  efficacy  included  2  Completer  analysis  sets,  defined  as 
all  subjects  who  completed  the  study through week  26  and through  week  56,  respectively.  The 
primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline in LDL-C at the end 
of  the  efficacy  phase  (week  26)  for  the  ITT  population.  Missing  data  at  week  26  were  imputed 
using  the  last  observation  obtained  during  the  efficacy  phase.  The  key  secondary  efficacy 
parameters were TC, apo B, and triglycerides. These were statistically evaluated separately in a 
sequential  fashion  at  alfa=0.05,  where  significance  was  claimed  for  an  endpoint  only  when  the 
previous parameter was significant. The additional secondary parameters of non-HDL-C, VLDL-C 
and Lp(a) were analysed in a similar fashion, separately from the first 3 parameters. Assessment 
of  treatment  group  differences  in  continuous  demographic  variables  was  conducted  using  an 
ANOVA  model  with  a  term  for  treatment  group  using  the  F-test.  For  the  categorical  variables, 
comparisons  across  treatment  groups  were  performed  using  a  chi-square  test.  The  statistical 
methods  applied  are  considered  appropriate  for  an  uncontrolled  trial.  However,  it  must  be 
remembered  that  a  statistically  significant  change  from  baseline  in  an  uncontrolled  trial  is  not 
proof of benefit.

All  29  patients  who  completed  the  run-in  phase  entered  the  efficacy  phase  with  23  (79%)  of 
these  completing  the  efficacy  phase  through  week  26.  Six  patients  (21%)  discontinued  during 
the efficacy phase; 4 patients discontinued because of adverse events (3 patients with GI events.  
One  patient  discontinued  because  of  unstable  prothrombin  index,  however,  also  had  GI  events 
contributing to withdrawal. And one patient withdrew due to non-compliance. 
Recruitment 
Study UP1002/AEGR-733-005 was conducted between December 2007 and February 2010 at 11 
study sites in the US (2), Canada (2), South Africa (3), and Italy (4). 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol under which the first patients were enrolled in 2007 at US study sites was 
Protocol UP1002, Version 5. The protocol was amended on 8 January 2008 to Version 6 and on 
20 May 2008 to Version 7, which was the protocol that was also initiated as Version 2 for AEGR-
733-005  at  sites  in  South  Africa,  Canada,  and  Italy.  There  were  2  additional  protocol 
amendments  (Versions  8  and  9  to  UP1002  and  Versions  3  and  4  for  AEGR-733-005,  which 
remained identical protocols). In addition, there was 1 regional amendment for sites in Canada. 
These amendments did not significantly impact the overall study conduct. 
Overall,  27  (93%)  of  the  29  patients  were  taking  concomitant  HMG  CoA  reductase  inhibitors 
(statins),  primarily  rosuvastatin  and  atorvastatin,  and  22  (76%)  were  taking  ezetimibe,  all  in 
combination with a statin. Three patients (10%) were using niacin and one (3%) was using a bile 
acid  sequestrant.  The  majority  of  patients  was  receiving  maximal  approved  doses  of  HMG  CoA 
reductase inhibitors. Eighteen patients were on apheresis. The patients were instructed to adhere 
to  a  strict  low-fat  diet  (i.e.,  averaged  <20%  of  calories  from  fat)  and  approximately  400  IU 
vitamin E daily. Patients also had to take approximately 200 mg linoleic acid, 110 mg EPA, 220  
mg ALA and 80 mg DHA per day.  
Stopping rules for treatment were: ALT or AST ≥10.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or ≥200 U/L 
on  2  separate  occasions  at  least 7  days  apart;  ALT or  AST  >20.0  x  ULN  at  a single time  point; 
ALT  >5  x  ULN  AND  total  bilirubin  >2  x  ULN  on  2  separate  occasions  at  least  7  days  apart; 
Alkaline  phosphatase  >5  x  ULN  on  2  separate  occasions  at  least  7  days  apart;  Total  bilirubin 
≥3.0 mg/dL in the absence of Gilbert’s syndrome or hemolysis; or Grade 3 or 4 hepatobiliary AE. 
Dose reduction rules were: two occasions separated by at least 7 days with ALT or AST between 
5.0 and 9.9 x ULN or >100 U/L but < 200 U/L levels, or decrease by ≥20% at any repeat visit 
after drug dose had been reduced.

Baseline  data  are  reflecting  of  a  relative  young  population  (18  top  55  years  of  age)  with  high 
levels of LDL-C at baseline. Several patients were already suffering from CV disease at a young 
age.  Patients  had  appropriate  background  therapy  at  the  study  start  as  27  of  the  29  patients 
were optimally treated with statins, in 76% of the cases with additional ezetimibe, and some with 
niacin or bile sequestrant.  
Numbers analysed

All 29 patients who entered the efficacy phase of study UP1002/AEGR-733-005 received at least 
one  dose  of  lomitapide  and had  at  least  one  post-baseline  efficacy  assessment  and  therefore 
were  included  in  the  ITT and  safety  populations  for  analysis  of  efficacy  and  safety  data, 
respectively. The  per  protocol  population  included  19  (66%)  of  the  29  patients;  10  patients 
were excluded  from  this  population,  primarily  related  to  changes  in  their  aphaeresis 
schedule during the efficacy phase or <80% or >120% compliance with study drug. A total of 23

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Percent Change in LDL-C to Week 26 
Lomitapide, added to each subject’s maximum tolerated dose of concurrently administered other 
lipid-lowering therapies and a low-fat diet for 26 weeks, significantly reduced the LDL-C levels. In 
the  ITT  population,  mean LDL-C  decreased  from  8.7  mmol/L  at  baseline  to  4.9  mmol/L at  the 
end  of  the  efficacy  phase  (week  26/LOCF),  which  represented  a  mean  change  of  -3.8  mmol/L 
and  a  clinically  meaningful,  statistically  significant  mean percent  change  from  baseline  of  -40% 
(p< 0.001) as summarised in the table below.

1 p-value on the mean percent change from baseline based on paired t-test. 
Mean LDL-C levels decreased significantly after 2 weeks of treatment with lomitapide at a mean 
dose of 5 mg, with mean percent change of -9% from baseline. A dose response was evident, as 
the  dose  was  escalated  through  the  planned  doses  of  10,  20, and  40  mg,  with  LDL-C  levels 
showing decreases from baseline with mean percent changes of -17%, -27% and -41% at weeks 
6,  10  and  14  (p<  0.001),  respectively.  Changes  over  time  for  LDL-C  for  the  23  patients  who 
completed the 26-week efficacy phase were similar to those reported for the ITT population, see 
figure  below.  During  the  safety  phase  from  week  26  through  week  56  there,  was  a  slight 
increase toward  baseline  in  LDL-C  levels;  however,  the  mean  percent  change from  baseline  at 
week 56 was statistically significant at -44% (p< 0.001).

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Results  for  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  of  TC,  apo  B,  and  triglycerides,  non-HDL-C  and 
VLDL-C were generally consistent with the values obtained for the primary endpoint LDL-C. The 
percent  decrease  in  Lp(a)  was  smaller  than  for  the  other  apo  B  containing lipoproteins,  with  a 
median  percent  change  of  -13%  from  baseline  to  week 26;  this  difference  was  not  statistically 
significant, as depicted in the summary table below.

Tertiary endpoints 
Mean percent changes from baseline in apo AI were -6.1% and -6.5% at week 16 in the phase 2 
study and at week 26/LOCF in the phase 3 study, respectively.  By week 56, mean apo AI levels 
had  increased  to  baseline  levels  and  the  mean  percent  change  from  baseline  to  this  time  point 
was  1%.  A  small  mean  percent  change  from  baseline  in  HDL-C  to  the  primary  time  point  was 
observed in both studies, which was not statistically significant in either study.   
Overall,  the  pivotal  study  showed  that  patients  were  on  a  considerable  duration  of  time  on 
lomitapide  treatment  (mean  322  days)  and  this  treatment  indicated  a  significant  reduction  of 
LDL-C of almost 40% (39.6%) with 72% showing more than 50% reduction in LDL-C. Secondary 
response parameters of cholesterol lowering are consistent with the primary endpoint. TC, non-
HDL-C,  Apo-B,  and  TG  all  showed  a  significant  reduction.  However,  no  significant  change  was 
found  for  levels  of  ApoA1  and  HDL-C  at  26  weeks  of  treatment.  Results  of  the  small  UP1001 
sUP1002/AEGR-733-005  study,  with  patients  not  on  background  lipid  lowering  therapy,  showed 
consistent results with the pivotal study. 
Ancillary analyses 
Twenty  seven  of  29  (93%)  of  the    patients  had  a  CV  history  (35%  CABG,  10%  coronary 
angioplasty,  10%  aortic  valve  replacement,  10%  cerebrovascular  disease,  3%  carotid 
endarterectomy). Furthermore, 55% of patients were male, 86% Caucasian, and 86% had a BMI 
<30 kg/m2. Only six (20%) of the 29 subjects were compliant over their treatment course with 
the strict low-fat diet (averaged <20% of calories from fat).

Subgroup  analyses  were  only  performed  in  the  hypercholesterolemic  studies,  as  only  in  this 
population  sufficient  data  were  available.  In  general,  no  obvious  differences  in  efficacy  were 
observed across patient subgroups with respect to age, gender, race, BMI and whether patients 
were on apheresis or not. Some observed differences were noted, but due to the lack of power, 
no  meaningful  conclusions  can  be  drawn.  The  figure  below  demonstrates  the  treatment  effects 
for  the  subgroups  of  patients  on  apheresis,  currently  the  most  effective  treatment  for  HoFH, 
versus those who are not. 
Mean percent change from baseline over time in LDL-C levels for patients who did and did not 
receive apheresis, efficacy phase based on available data at each assessment and at week 
26/LOCF. 
In the ITT population (n=29), mean LDL-C decreased from 336 mg/dL (8.7 mmol/L) at baseline 
to 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) at the end of the efficacy phase (week 26/LOCF), a mean change of -
146.9 mg/dL (3.8 mmol/L), with a mean percent change from baseline of -40% [95%CI: -51.9, -
28.2;  p<  0.001].  In  the  PP  analysis  (n=19),  this  was  -52%  for  LDL-C.  At  week  56,  the  mean 
percent change from baseline in LDL-C in this study was -44% for the 23 subjects who were on 
treatment from study from week 26 to week 56 (no discontinuations during this period). 
Ten  patients  did  not  meet  the  PP  protocol  analysis  due  to  an  adjustment  in  their  apheresis 
schedule or because they were non-compliant to study drug. Eight patients missed an apheresis 
treatment  or  modified  the  time  between  treatments  more  than  two  days  (deviated  from  the 
protocol-specified requirement of maintaining the interval within ±1 day). Four (31%) were able 
to  completely  stop  (three  patients)  or  permanently  increase  (one  patient)  the  interval  between 
apheresis treatments and maintain low LDL-C levels through Week 56.

In  a  responder  analysis  21  (72%)  of  patients  had  a  50%  or  greater  reduction  in  LDL-C  from 
baseline. Treatment goals of LDL<2.6mmol/L and <1.8 mmol/L were achieved in 55% and 31% 
of HoFH patients respectively.

The  dose  escalation  demonstrated  that  higher  lomitapide  doses  were  associated  with  greater 
reductions  in  LDL-C  up  to  60  mg.  Data  from  patients  treated  with  80  mg  of  lomitapide  are 
inconclusive as only one patient achieved to attain this dose. The overall evidence suggests that 
generally a dose proportional response is likely across the recommended range.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Two  sets  of  pooled  analyses  were  carried  out.  The  first  focused  on  the  primary  indication  i.e. 
patients  with  HoFH,  including  data  from  the  phase  3  pivotal  study  UP1002/AEGR-733- 005  and 
the  phase  2  supportive  study,  UP1001.  Four  subjects  who  were  treated  in  Study  UP1001  were 
also  treated  in  Study UP1002/AEGR-733-005.  These  subjects  were  included  in  both  UP1001 
and UP1002/AEGR-733-005  since  there  was  a  long  duration  of  “washout”  between  studies and 
the  study  design  was  different. The  second  pooled  analysis  includes  5  studies  conducted  in 
subjects  with  elevated  LDL-C  or  other  risk factors  (AEGR-733-001,  AEGR-733-003b,  AEGR-733-
004, AEGR-733-006 and CV145-009) used to support the lipid-lowering effect of lomitapide. With 
regard  to  the  lipid  endpoints,  these  analyses,  especially  in  HoFH  patients,  provide  only  limited 
additional  information  on  efficacy  over  what  was  shown  for  the  individual  studies  due  to  the 
limited  size  of  the  population.  Overall,  there  were  no  clear  clinically  relevant  or  consistent 
differences  in  mean  percent  changes from  baseline  to  weeks  4  or  8  for  subjects  by  age,  race, 
BMI  or smoking  status.  Subjects  with  higher  baseline  LDL-C  tended  to  have  a  greater 
mean decrease from baseline following active treatment than subjects with lower baseline LDL-C. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No special populations were examined in the efficacy studies.  
Supportive studies 
Results  of  the  following  randomized,  double-blind,  active-controlled,  parallel-group  phase  2 
studies  concerning  patients  with  moderate  hypercholesterolemia  were  discussed  in  the  dose-
response section:

Study  AEGR-733-001:  A  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Active-Controlled,  Parallel-Group  Study  to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of the Combination AEGR-733 and Ezetimibe vs. Monotherapy in 
Subjects with Moderate Hypercholesterolemia. 
This study assessed the efficacy and safety of the co-administration of lomitapide plus ezetimibe 
versus  monotherapy  with  either  compound.  The  study  consisted  of  2 periods,  a  1-  to  2-week 
screening  period  where  baseline  lipids  and  other  characteristics  were  evaluated  to  determine 
study  eligibility  and  a  12-week  treatment period  with  interim  visits  at  weeks 4  and  8.  A low-fat 
diet  (<20%  energy  from  fat)  throughout  the  study  was  recommended. Subjects  who  received 
lomitapide  +  ezetimibe  achieved  a  mean LDL-C  percent  change  of  -46.2%  after  12  weeks  of 
therapy;  the  lomitapide  monotherapy group  had  a  mean  percent  change  of  -29.9%;  and  the 
ezetimibe monotherapy group had a mean percent change of -19.6%. Similar results were noted 
for the secondary efficacy parameters of TC, apo B and non- HDL-C. 
Study AEGR-733-003: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to 
Evaluate  the  Safety  and  Efficacy  of  the  Combination  of  AEGR-733  (Formerly  BMS-201038)  and 
Atorvastatin 20 mg vs Monotherapy in Subjects with Moderate Hypercholesterolemia. 
This  Phase  2  was  a  continuation  of  the  terminated  study  AEGR-733-003a  and  restarted  with  a 
new drug product as a 6-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, randomised clinical trial 
to  assess  the  efficacy  of  5  mg  and  10  mg  of  lomitapide  alone  and  in  combination  with 
atorvastatin  20  mg  on LDL-C  and  other lipid parameters.  Comparisons  were made  to  a placebo 
arm  and  to  atorvastatin  20  mg  monotherapy.  A  total  of  157  subjects  were  randomized.  A  low-
fat/low cholesterol diet supplying <30% kcal as fat, <7% kcal as saturated fatty acid and <200 
mg  dietary  cholesterol  was  recommended.  Overall,  53  (34%)  of  the  157  subjects  withdrew 
prematurely  from  the  study,  including  4%,  4%,  35%,  62%,  31%,  and  69%  of  subjects  in  the 
placebo, atorvastatin 20 mg, lomitapide 5 mg, lomitapide 10 mg, lomitapide 5 mg + atorvastatin 
20  mg  and  lomitapide  10  mg  +  atorvastatin  20  mg  groups,  respectively.  The  most  common 
reason  for  premature  withdrawal  from  the  study  was  adverse  event.  Mean  percent  changes  in 
LDL-C  from  baseline  to  week  8  were  2%  in  the  placebo  group;  -42%  in  the  atorvastatin 
monotherapy  group;  -16%  and  -37%  in  the  lomitapide  5  and  10  mg  monotherapy  groups, 
respectively; and -47% and -50% in the lomitapide 5 mg + atorvastatin and lomitapide 10 mg + 
atorvastatin  groups,  respectively.  All  5  active  treatments  had  a  statistically  significant  decrease 
in  LDL-C  from  baseline  to  week  8  as  compared  to  placebo  (p  <0.0019).  LDL-C  reductions  with 
the  lomitapide  atorvastatin  +  combinations  were  statistically  significant  also  when  compared  to 
lomitapide 5 mg but not against the other treatments.

Evaluate Low Doses of the MTP-Inhibitor AEGR-733 [lomitapide] on Hepatic Fat Accumulation as 
Measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.  
This  was  primarily  a  safety  study  but  lipid  parameters  were  also  measured.  It  was  designed  as 
an  8  arm,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  phase  2  study  in  order  to 
assess  the  effect  of  lomitapide  2.5,  5,  7.5  and  10  mg  alone  and  lomitapide  5  mg  with 
atorvastatin  20  mg,  micronized  fenofibrate  145  mg  or  ezetimibe  10  mg  on  hepatic  fat 
accumulation  as  measured  by  magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy  (MRS)/MRI.  The  results  were 
generally consistent with the findings of the previous studies.

to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of the Combination of AEGR-733 and Atorvastatin 20 mg vs 
Atorvastatin Monotherapy in Subjects with Moderate Hypercholesterolemia. 
This  was  a  2  arm,  randomised,  double-blind,  active-comparator,  phase  2  study  designed  to 
assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  lomitapide  dose  escalated  from  2.5  to  5  mg  with  atorvastatin 
compared  with  atorvastatin  alone.  Subjects  who  met  entry  criteria  were  to  discontinue  any 
current  lipid-lowering  medications  and  to  follow  a  low-fat,  low  cholesterol  diet  supplying  <30% 
kcal  as  fat  for  a  35-day  period.  A  total  of  44  subjects  were  randomised  into  this  study.  The 
addition  of  lomitapide  to  atorvastatin  20  mg  resulted  in  statistically  significant  reductions  in 
serum LDL-C compared with atorvastatin 20 mg monotherapy over an 8-week treatment period. 
Results  for  the  majority  of  secondary  lipid  efficacy  endpoints  were  consistent  with  results 
observed in LDL-C. 
The  high  discontinuation  rate  in  some  studies,  reaching  more  than  the  third  of  the  study 
population in AEGR-733-003 was noted by the CHMP. This issue is further discussed in the safety 
section. Overall, the findings of the supportive studies are consistent with the pivotal trial.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In terms of the dose finding studies, the doses below 10mg/day, including the proposed starting 
dose  of  5  mg,  would  be  expected  to  have  a  minimal  effect  on  lipids  but  they  appear  to  be 
necessary  as  a  first  step  in  a  dose  escalation  regimen  aiming  at  attenuating  the  GI  adverse 
effects. Doses 10 mg and higher appear to have a significant and proportionally increasing effect. 
However, there is some uncertainty, especially about the upper bound of the proposed range, as 
it is not possible to properly evaluate a dose response in a clinical trial with a single arm forced 
titration  design,  as  opposed  to  a  trial  where  patients  are  randomised  to  the  different  doses. 
Nevertheless,  clinical  evidence  supports  the  theory  that  patients  reaching  the  highest  dose 
experience the greatest benefits.  
The main clinical programme for lomitapide consisted of two studies performed in 29 and 6 HoFH 
patients, respectively, and five studies performed in hypercholesterolemic (elevated LDL-C pool) 
patients.  The  elevated  LDL-C  pool  patients  supplies  additional  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  a 
different,  but  related  population.  Both,  the  HoFH  studies  and  the  supportive  studies,  provide 
efficacy  and  safety  data  for  use  of  lomitapide  monotherapy,  as  well  as  on  top  of  existing  lipid 
lowering therapy. However, the clinical programme is very limited, especially with regards to the 
target population included in the proposed indication. This is due to the very low prevalence (and 
availability)  of  these  types  of  patients.  The  duration  of  the  supportive  studies  is  8  to  12  weeks 
only and therefore limits evaluation of maintenance of effect, tolerability and long-term safety. 
There was a single pivotal study to demonstrate the efficacy of lomitapide in patients with HoFH.  
A  dose  escalating  scheme  was  used  to  minimise  the  significant  gastrointestinal  and  hepatic 
events  based  on  the  efficacy  and  tolerability  experience  in  the  limited  phase  2  study  in  HoFH 
patients.  
In  this  pivotal  study,  on  top  of lipid lowering  background  therapy,  a  dose level  of  39.4  mg  was 
the  average  dose  reached  with  only  one  patient  achieving  80  mg.    Based  on  these  data,  the 
Assessment report  
Page 57/107 
 
  
  
 
recommended  dose  range  for  lomitapide  was  5  mg  to  60  mg  given  orally  once  daily.  The 
inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  of  the  HoFH  population  in  the  pivotal  study  were  thought  to  be 
appropriate  by  the  CHMP.  Background  therapy  would  have  been  stabilised  during  the  6  week 
period prior to start of lomitapide administration and during the remainder of the 26 weeks until 
the  primary  endpoint.  Almost  all  patients  were  on  an  optimal  dose  of  statin  therapy.  This  was 
considered appropriate. 
The pivotal study is limited, mainly due to the single arm open-label design, where both, patients 
and  investigators  were  clearly  not  blinded  to  study  treatment  allocation.  However,  the  very 
prominent gastrointestinal adverse events, warranting a dose titration based on gastrointestinal 
tolerability  and  the  rarity  of  the  condition,  provide  sufficient  rationale  for  the  chosen  study 
design.  The  CHMP  considere  re-assuring  that  a  Data  Safety  Monitoring  Board  assessed  the 
validity  and  integrity  of  the  safety  data,  including  clinical  laboratory  testing.  Objective 
assessment  of  the  primary  outcome  measure,  the  LDL-C  level,  was  further  secured  by 
measurement  of  lipid  levels  at  a  central  laboratory.  In  addition,  the  supportive  studies  provide 
additional placebo and active controlled information.  
The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  objectives  were  considered  adequate  by  the  CHMP.  Lipid 
levels  were  regularly  assessed  throughout  the  study.  This  was  necessary  in  order  to  achieve  a 
good  understanding  on  how  lipid  levels  develop  during  the  study.  The  primary  evaluation  of 
efficacy was at 26 weeks. Nevertheless, the extension of the pivotal study until up to 78 weeks 
of  follow-up  for  safety  results  allows  for  further  evaluation  of  maintenance  of  the  lomitapide’s 
effect  on  LDL-C  levels.  The  statistics  applied  involve  the  standard  methods  and  are  considered 
appropriate.  Similarly,  the  sample  size  calculation  appeared  to  be  adequate.  Stopping  rules 
regarding  the  liver  toxicity  were  applied  during  the  study  and  are  considered  adequate  by  the 
CHMP;  namely  the  SmPC  requires  the  treating  physicians  to  stop  lomitapide  treatment  if  the 
LDL-C levels do not drop by 15%.  
Overall, the CHMP agreed that the efficacy data from the pivotal clinical trials were supportive of 
the  claimed  indication  for  lomitapide.  However,  the  CHMP  also  noted  that  the  assumed  clinical 
benefit of lomitapide is based on a surrogate endpoint (lowering of LDL-C levels) and this would 
have  to  be  confirmed  in  clinical  practice  via  a  post-marketing  clinical  study  assessing  the  CVS 
benefits  of  the  treatment.  As  this  long-term  outcome  is  considered  key  to  the  benefit  risk,  the 
CHMP agreed with the applicant that this study would be imposed as a condition to the marketing 
authorisation.  
Furthermore,  given  the  safety  profile  of  this  product,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  it  is 
critical  to  ensure  that  only  HoFH  patients  will  receive  lomitapide.  Thus,  the  originally  proposed 
indication was requested to be further restricted (see Clinical Safety section). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All  supportive  studies  provide  evidence  of  a  dose  response  relationship  to  the  lomitapide 
treatment.  Doses  5  to  25  mg  were  investigated  in  the  hypercholesterolemic  patient  population 
either alone or on top of existing lipid lowering therapy (atorvastatin or ezetimibe). The obtained 
data showed that a maximum lipid lowering effect was achieved after 2 weeks of the fixed dosing 
and remained almost stable, with slight diminishing of the effect until week 8. These studies also 
demonstrated significant reduction in secondary endpoints of total cholesterol, apo B, non-HDL, 
and triglycerides levels.

Concerning  the  subsequent  pivotal  HoFH  study,  the  reasons  for  inclusion  and  exclusion  of 
patients in and from the study are justified. A substantial part of the HoFH patients (17%, n=6) 
discontinued  the  study.  This  percentage  was  higher 
in  the  phase  2  studies  with 
hypecholesterolemic  patients  (22%),  where  lower  maximal  but  fixed  doses  were  used.  The 
primary  reason  was  adverse  events;  5  of  6  patients  discontinuing  due  to  GI  adverse  events, 
indicating  a  low  tolerability  level  of  lomitapide.  Furthermore,  during  the  conduct  of  the  trial,  a 
poor  compliance  with  regard  to  diet  was  observed.  Although  the  data  are  limited  when 
subdividing  the  patient  population  according  to  their  fat  intake,  there  is  no  indication  of  a 
substantial  difference  in  lipid  lowering  efficacy  between  patients  with  a  high  or  low  fat 
consumption.  In  this  HoFH  pivotal  study,  baseline  data  were  reflective  of  a  relative  young 
population (18 to 55 years of age) with high levels of LDL-C at baseline. Twenty seven (93%) of 
the 29 patients had a cardiovascular disease history (e.g. 8 (27.6%) angina pectoris, 5 (17.2%) 
MI, 10 (34.5) coronary artery bypass) at the start of the study.  
Patients  had  appropriate  background  therapy  at  start  of  study;  27  of  the  29  patients  were 
optimally  treated  with  statins,  in  76%  of  the  cases  with  additional  ezetimibe,  and  some  with 
niacin or bile acid sequestrants. Eighteen patients were on apheresis. 
Ultimately,  in  the  pivotal  study  patients  were  able  to  continue  on  lomitapide  therapy  for  a 
considerable  duration  of  time  (mean  322  days)  with  23  out  of  29  patients  for  more  than  365 
days.  No  patients  discontinued  from  week  26  to  56.  Lomitapide  showed  a  clear  significant 
reduction  of  LDL-C  of  almost  40%  (39.6%),  with  72%  of  the  subjects  showing  more  than  50% 
reduction  in  LDL-C.  However,  after  18  weeks  of  treatment  the  effect  slightly  diminished. 
Secondary  lipid  outcome  parameters  were  consistent  with  the  effect  observed  on  the  primary 
endpoint.  TC,  non-HDL-C,  Apo-B,  and  TG  all  showed  a  significant  reduction.  However,  no 
significant change was found for ApoA1 and HDL-C  at 26 weeks of treatment. Although the Per 
Protocol  population  differs  substantially  from  the  ITT  population  (19  versus  29  patients),  the 
overall results of LDL-C lowering (50% instead of 40% LDL-C lowering) are approximately similar 
and  therefore  did  not  substantially  impact  the  results.  When  data  are  presented  according  to 
LDL-C lowering with regard to maximum tolerated dose, a dose from 20 mg to 60 mg showed a 
dose dependent reduction in LDL-C while this association could not be found for the other doses, 
mainly  because  of  discontinuations  due  to  safety.  Although  protocol  deviations  were  found 
because  of  apheresis,  this  did  not  substantially  impact  the  results.  For  patients  treated  until  56 
weeks  (n=23),  LDL-C  reduction  was  essentially  similar  with  the  ITT  population  with  a  50% 
reduction at 26 weeks and 44% reduction at 56 weeks. 
Results of the small UP1001 proof of concept study (n=6), with HoFH patients not on background 
lipid  lowering  therapy,  showed  consistent  results  with  the  pivotal  study.  The  baseline 
characteristics  of  the  hypercholesterolemic  patients  in  the  supportive  phase  2  studies  are,  as 
expected,  different  from  the  HoFH  patients,  mainly  in  the  sense  that  the  patients  are  older. 
However,  these  studies  are  meaningful  in  the  way  that  they  provide  substantially  more 
information on placebo-controlled and active-controlled treatment effect of lomitapide, albeit in a 
different patient population and for a short-term period of time (8 to 12 weeks). 
Subgroup  analyses  were  only  performed  in  the  hypercholesterolemic  studies,  as  only  in  this 
population sufficient data were available. Subgroup analyses were performed with respect to age, 
gender, BMI, region, race and baseline LDL-C level. In general,  no substantial differences could 
Assessment report  
Page 59/107 
 
  
  
 
be  observed,  but  no  definite  conclusions  on  subgroups  could  be  made  due  to  the  low  patient 
numbers. 
Additional expert consultation 
The CHMP requested the opinion of additional experts on the uncertainties identified during the 
assessment of lomitapide’s efficacy and safety profile in the HoFH patients. Due to the fact that 
majority of these concerns relate to safety and the adverse profile of this product, the details of 
the experts' consultation and its outcome are summarised in the Clinical Safety section. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The safety and efficacy of Lojuxta in children below 18 years of age have not been established 
and the use of this medicinal product in children is therefore not recommended. No paediatric 
data are available. The agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for lomitapide includes: 
-  Waiver in all subsets of the HoFH paediatric population from birth to less than 8 years of age 
and a deferral of the study in children from 8 to less than 18 years of age; 
-  Waiver in patients with HeFH of all age subsets of the paediatric population from birth to less 
than 18 years of age; 
The PDCO agreed a single-arm, open-label trial in paediatric patients with HoFH on stable lipid-
lowering  therapy.  However,  due  to  the  unknown  clinical  relevance  of  the  risk  for  tumour 
formation  (i.e.  hepatocellular  adenomas/carcinomas  and  dermal/epithelial  hyperplasia),  the 
PDCO  requested  that  this  study  must  not  be  initiated  before  the  CHMP  concludes  on  a  positive 
benefit/risk  balance  of  lomitapide  in  HoFH  adults,  and  before  the  PDCO  re-discusses  and 
evaluates  the  potential  significant  therapeutic  benefit  and  need  for  paediatric  studies  for 
lomitapide.  
The CHMP recommends that in the light of their positive benefit/risk balance conclusion in adult 
patients,  the  applicant  initiates  the  above  described  dialogue  with  the  PDCO  at  the  earliest 
possibility with a view to agree on the final PIP. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of an MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
The  applicant  did  not  provide  results  from  a  full  clinical  development  with  lomitapide  and  the 
CHMP  agreed  with  the  applicant’s  argument  that  the  patient  population  of  lomitapide  is 
encountered  so  rarely  that  the  applicant  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  provide 
comprehensive  clinical  data  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  this  medicinal  product.  As  a 
consequence,  the  applicant  will  be  obliged  to  provide  further  evidence  as  specific  obligations 
relating in particular to the safety and efficacy as follows: 
The applicant shall set up a long term prospective observational study to systematically collect 
information on the safety and effectiveness outcomes of patients treated with lomitapide.  
The objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the occurrence of the following in patients treated with lomitapide: 
o  Hepatic events 
o  Gastrointestinal events 
o  Small bowel, hepatic, colorectal and pancreatic tumours  
o  Events associated with coagulopathy  
o  Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) events  
Assessment report

o  Death, including cause of death 
• To evaluate the occurrence and outcomes of pregnancy in females of reproductive potential 
treated with lomitapide who decide to continue the pregnancy following advice from a 
teratologist.  
• To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of lomitapide in maintaining control of serum lipid 
levels in clinical practice. 
• To evaluate whether prescribers of lomitapide are following the screening and monitoring 
recommendations as specified in the product information and the educational materials. 
These specific obligations shall be annually reassessed.   
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  lomitapide  to  lower  LDL-C  in  a  HoFH  population  was  demonstrated  in  a  very 
limited dataset, mainly due to the rarity of the disease, and using a suboptimal study design. 
These were supported by short-term efficacy data in hypercholesterolemic patients. As per the 
CHMP  guideline  EMA/CPMP/3020/2003,  lowering  of  the  LDL-C  level  is  considered  an 
appropriate surrogate endpoint of lipid lowering agents aiming at lowering the cardiovascular 
risk in the affected patients. However, the absolute long term effect remains to be evaluated. 
Therefore, the CHMP was  of the opinion that the originally proposed indication for lomitapide 
would need to be restricted further, in order to guarantee that only those patients are treated, 
who  can  truly  benefit  from  this  medicinal  product.  The  revised  and  agreed  indication  for 
Lojuxta is: 
Lojuxta is indicated as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering medicinal products 
with or without low density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis in adult patients with homozygous 
familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH). 
Genetic confirmation of HoFH should be obtained whenever possible. Other forms of primary 
hyperlipoproteinemia and secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia (e.g. nephrotic syndrome, 
hypothyroidism) must be excluded. 
The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  applicant’s  argument  that  the  patient  population  of  lomitapide  is 
encountered  so  rarely  that  the  applicant  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  provide 
comprehensive  clinical  data  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  this  medicinal  product.  As  a 
consequence,  the  applicant  will  be  obliged  to  provide  further  evidence  as  specific  obligations

Overall summary of TEAEs for the pivotal study. 
Gastrointestinal  adverse  events:  The  following  were  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAE  among 
HoFH  patients:  diarrhoea  (80%),  nausea  (60%),  vomiting  (34%),  dyspepsia  (31%),  abdominal 
discomfort  (26%),  abdominal  pain  (23%),  upper  abdominal  pain,  and  constipation  (20%)  (see 
table below). The mean and median time to a first GI event in the 27 patients experiencing them 
was 9.1 days and 5.0 days, respectively, and ranged from 1 to 39 days. In the pivotal study, the 
incidence  of  diarrhoea  decreased  from  79%  to  35%  from  the  26  week  phase  to  the  56  week 
phase,  respectively.  Overall,  6  (20%)  of  29  HoFH  subjects  experienced  a  severe  GI  event,  of 
which all but one were considered to be drug-related, including diarrhoea (14%), vomiting (7%) 
and  single  cases  of  abdominal  discomfort,  abdominal  distension,  abdominal  pain,  constipation, 
dyspepsia,  food  poisoning,  and  gastric  dilatation  (3%).  Five  (17%)  subjects  discontinued  study 
treatment  because  of  GI  symptoms.  Around  41%  patients  had  dose  reductions  and/or  dose 
interruptions, duration of which were short with a median of 5 days and occurred during the first 
26 weeks. GI symptoms were the main cause for patients not reaching the highest dose.

In the supportive studies in hypercholesterolemic patients, the GI adverse events seemed dose-
dependent.  In  the  escalated  dose  group,  the  dose  was  up-titrated  based  on  tolerability.  The 
maximal  dose  level  reached  was  10  mg.  Gastrointestinal  disorders  of  severe  intensity,  most 
commonly  diarrhoea,  were  reported  in  9%,  12%,  28%  and  13%  of  subjects  in  the  escalated-, 
low-,  mid-,  and  high-dose  lomitapide  groups,  respectively.  Diarrhoea  was  the  most  commonly 
reported TEAE leading to discontinuation. Nausea was also among the most commonly reported 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation. 
Hepatic  adverse  events:  In  the  HoFH  population,  twelve  (34%)  of  35  subjects  experienced  at 
least one AE classified as a hepatic disorder; the most common were elevations in transaminase 
levels,  of  which  most  were  considered  to  be  related  to  treatment.  Six  subjects  experienced 
serious  hepatic  disorders  including  increased  ALT  (5  subjects),  increased  AST  (3  subjects),  and 
hepatic  steatosis,  hepatic  toxicity,  and  prothrombin  time  prolonged  (1  subject  each),  as 
summarised  in  the  table  below.  For  two  of  the  three  patients  with  ALT  elevation  >5x  ULN  and 
hepatic  fat  levels  >20%  during  lomitapide  treatment,  hepatic  steatosis  was  reported  and  this 
required a dose modification. None of the reported hepatic disorders were severe or resulted in 
study drug discontinuation in the HoFH population.

disorder  (13%,  <1%,  5%,  and  5%  in  the  escalated-,  low-,  mid-,  and  high-dose  groups, 
respectively).

Accumulation  of  fat  in  the  liver:  Analyses  of  hepatic  fat  by  imaging  procedures  NMRS  and  MRI 
were  performed  in  the  HoFH  studies.  Consistent  with  the  mechanism  of  action  of  lomitapide, 
increases  in  hepatic  triglyceride  content  were  observed.  The  levels  decreased  spontaneously 
during  continued  treatment  in  some  subjects,  but  remained  elevated  in  most  during  the 
treatment  period.  Reversal  of  the  hepatic  fat  accumulation  was  observed  when  subjects 
discontinued  lomitapide.  A  mean  absolute  change  in  hepatic  fat  percent  of  8%  at  the  week  26 
and 6% at week 56 was observed in the pivotal study. The majority of patients (13 of 23, 57%) 
with  hepatic  fat  assessments  had  maximal  hepatic  fat  percentages  <10%  during  the  78-week 
phase 3 study. The hepatic fat percentage was >20% in three patients and all three subjects also 
had  ALT  levels  >5x  ULN  during  lomitapide  treatment.  In  two  of  these,  fat  levels  decreased  to 
<20%  at  the  next  assessment  during  continued  treatment  with  lomitapide.  In  one  case,    on-
treatment hepatic fat levels continued to increase to a maximum level of 44% reported at week 
61. This patient completed the study through Week 78. At the post-treatment assessment (week 
84;  six  weeks  off  treatment),  a  computed  tomography  scan  revealed  significantly  decreased 
hepatic fat content to 7-15%. 
In the supportive HoFH study UP1001 (n=6), a mean absolute increase in hepatic fat percent of 
19%  was  observed  from  a  baseline  value  of  3%.    At  4  weeks  after  completion  of  dosing,  the 
mean  absolute  change  in  hepatic  fat  percent  from  baseline  was  5%  indicating  reversibility  of 
hepatic fat content in the liver. 
Maximum categorical change in hepatic fat percent: HoFH indication (study UP1001 and 
UP1002/AEGR-733-005). 
Hepatic  fat  content  in  the  liver  was  also  measured  by  MRI  in  studies  AEGR-733-002  (2  weeks, 
healthy volunteers), AEGR-733-004 (measured at week 12) and CV145-009 (measured at week 
4,  and  again  6  weeks  after  withdrawing  treatment).  In  Study  CV145-009,  the  extent  of 
reversibility  of  hepatic  fat  increases  was  assessed  in  76  (63  completed)  subjects  with  LDL-C 
≥160  mg/dL  and  TG  <500  mg/dL.  Liver  MRI/NMRS  imaging  was  performed  at  baseline,  end  of 
treatment  (25  mg 
lomitapide  or  matched 
for  4  weeks)  and 6  weeks  after  drug 
discontinuation. Lomitapide  treatment  resulted  in  hepatic  fat  accumulation (11.03%  hepatic  fat 
content  at  baseline  increased  to  31.65%  by  the  end  of  treatment)  and  this  effect  was  almost 
fully  reversed  after  6  weeks  off  treatment.  The  mean  absolute  increase  in percent  hepatic  fat 
content  of  20.88%  at  the  end  of  4  weeks  of  treatment  decreased  to  4.02%  by  the  end  of 6 
weeks  off  treatment.  Subjects  in  the  placebo  group  showed  essentially  no  change  in  mean 
percent hepatic  fat  content.  The  difference  in change  in  percent  hepatic  fat  between  lomitapide

and  placebo  was  statistically  significant  between  baseline and  the  end  of  4  weeks  of  treatment 
(p<.0001) but not after 6 weeks off the drug (p=0.13).    
Cardiovascular  adverse  events:  Five  (14%)  of  35  subjects  with  HoFH  experienced  at  least  one 
cardiovascular  event  (2  serious)  unrelated  to  study  drug:  angina  pectoris  in  3  subjects,  and  1 
subject each with acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery arteriosclerosis, and blood creatine 
phosphokinase  increased;  1  subject  with  angina  pectoris  also  had  acute  coronary  syndrome 
reported.  Three  subjects  experienced  at  least  1  CV  event  (one  fatal  MI,  unrelated)  in  the 
hypercholesterolemic population. 
Musculoskeletal  adverse  events:  There  were  no  reports  of  rhabdomyolysis  in  the  lomitapide 
programme.    Four  (11%)  of  35  HoFH  subjects  experienced  musculoskeletal  system  events  or 
events potentially associated with rhabdomyolysis (myalgia; musculoskeletal pain, blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased, and transient acute renal failure). These were considered unrelated to 
study  drug.  As  described  in  the  individual  study  report,  nine  (31%)  of  the  29  patients  had  a 
musculoskeletal disorder reported during the study. The incidence was highest during dosing with 
60 mg lomitapide with incidences of 7%, 7%, 8%, 5%, 23% and 0% during dosing with 5, 10, 
20, 40, 60 and 80 mg, respectively. None led to study drug discontinuation.  A mean maximum 
increase of 163 IU/L was observed for CPK, from a baseline value of 135 IU/L; this was related 
to  one  subject  who  had  a  maximum  increase  of  1540  U/L  receiving  rosuvastatin  40  mg  and 
ezetimibe  10  mg  during  lomitapide  treatment,  and  continued  treatment.  No  musculoskeletal 
symptoms were reported in this subject.  
In  the  hypercholesterolemic  population,  the  incidence  of  musculoskeletal  events  was  3%,  5%, 
0%, and 0% in the escalated, low-, mid-, and high-dose groups and 1% and 3% in the placebo 
and active control groups, respectively. Severe myalgia was reported for 1 (<1%) subject in the 
lomitapide low-dose group and 1 (1%) subject in the active control group (discontinued). There 
was no difference in maximum mean change in CPK for the placebo group versus lomitapide with 
one subject each with Grade 3 or 4 increased CPK.  
Pulmonary  function:  One  (3%)  of  35  subjects  with  HoFH  experienced  wheezing.  Respiratory 
disorders  were  reported  in  six  (21%)  of  the  29  patients;  of  nasal  congestion  and 
pharyngolaryngeal  pain,  each  reported  in  three  patients  (10%)  assessed  as  unrelated  to  study 
treatment.  Three  subjects  in  the  hypercholesterolemic  population  experienced  one  (unrelated) 
event of asthma or bronchospasm (escalated, low-dose and mid-dose group).  
Weight loss: Six (21%) of 29 subjects with HoFH experienced at least one weight loss event and 
this event was considered drug-related for four of six subjects. At Weeks 26 and 56, weight had 
decreased a mean of 3.4 (-4.7%) and 2.4 kg (-3.5%) from baseline. All weight loss events were 
assessed  as  mild  to  moderate  in  severity,  non-serious  and  none  led  to  study  drug 
discontinuation. There were no significant correlations between change in weight and number of 
diarrhoea  events  at  any  time  point.  In  the  hypercholesterolemic  population  two  subjects  (high-
dose) experienced weight loss (one discontinued). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
One (17%) of six subjects in the 16-week HoFH supportive study and three (10%) of 29 subjects 
in  the  56  weeks  pivotal  study  experienced  a  serious  adverse  event.  According  to  the  applicant, 
no  events  were  related  to  study  treatment,  but  most  to  the  subject’s  underlying  CV  disease

(acute coronary syndrome and angina pectoris, or coronary artery arteriosclerosis), or the event 
was  related to prior  cardiac  surgery  (post-operative  seroma,  breast  mass).    One  subject  with a 
history  of  menorrhagia  required  a  hysterectomy.  Lower  respiratory  tract  infection  was  also 
reported as an SAE in the subject with acute coronary syndrome and angina pectoris. There were 
six  subjects  in  the  hypercholesterolemic  population,  who  experienced  a  serious  AE,  including  1 
(1%), 2 (1%) and 3 (3%) in the escalated, low- and mid-dose groups, respectively. One subject 
each  in  the  escalated  low-,  and  mid-dose  groups  experienced  a  myocardial  infarction.  One 
subject in the escalated-dose group (AEGR-733-001) died as a result of this MI.  All other SAEs 
were  reported  in  1  subject  each  and  included  chest  pain  in  the  lomitapide  low-dose  group  and 
ankle fracture and inflammatory bowel disease in the lomitapide mid-dose group. 
There were no deaths reported during either HoFH studies. As stated above, 1 death (unrelated) 
occurred in the hypercholesterolemic population.  The subject was a 54-year-old Caucasian male 
with  medical  history  significant  for  deep  vein  thrombosis,  peptic  ulcer,  Factor  V  Leiden,  and 
hypertension,  who  received  lomitapide  for  12  weeks.    The  subject  developed  nausea  and 
diaphoresis  and  ventricular  fibrillation,  and  received  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation.    He  was 
cyanotic without cardiac activity and died. 
There  have  been  no  reports  of  malignancies  across  the  lomitapide  clinical  programme,  which  is 
reassuring. However, in non-clinical studies, long-term fat accumulation as well as an increased 
number of tumours was observed in liver, small intestine and pancreas. Fatty liver in itself might 
be a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. 
In the pivotal study with HoFH patients, infections were reported in 17 (59%) of the 29 patients, 
with  the  highest  incidence  observed  with  60  mg  lomitapide  (seven  of  13  patients,  54%).  The 
incidence at the other dose levels were 10%, 4%, 27%, 19% and 0% at doses of 5, 10, 20, 40 
and 80 mg, respectively. The types of infections reported in 10% or more of the 29 patients were 
nasopharyngitis  (17%),  gastroenteritis  (14%),  and  influenza  (14%).  Two  patients  experienced 
gastroenteritis  that  was  assessed  as  treatment-related;  all  other  infections  were  reported  as 
unrelated  to  lomitapide  treatment.  With  the  exception  of  1  report  of  lower  respiratory  tract 
infection, which was assessed as severe in intensity, all other infections were reported as mild to 
moderate in intensity. 
Laboratory findings 
Liver function tests: Elevations of ALT >3 to ≤5×ULN were observed in five (14%) of 35 subjects 
in  the  HoFH  pool  and  elevations  >5  to  ≤10×ULN  were  observed  for  five  (14%)  subjects.  One 
subject  in  study  UP1001  had  a  transient  elevation  in  ALT  >10  to  ≤20×ULN.  This  subject  was 
subsequently  enrolled  in  the  pivotal  study,  and  again  experienced  a  transient  elevation  in  ALT 
>10 to ≤20×ULN. Furthermore, one patient experienced an ALT > 20x ULN. Median time to ALT 
or AST >3×ULN was 55 days in study UP1001 and 112 days in the pivotal study. Median duration 
of  the  abnormal  transaminase  elevation  (time  from  onset  of  abnormality  >3×ULN  to  return  to 
within the normal range) was 36 days in study UP1001 and 29 days in the pivotal study. 
Statistically  significant  (p≤0.0212)  correlations  were  noted  for  changes  in  ALT  and  in  AST  with 
changes  in  LDL-C  at  week  26  (r=-0.6194  and  r=-0.6457,  respectively)  and  at  week  56  (r=-
0.5012 and r=-0.4740, respectively). Changes in ALT and AST were also significantly (p≤0.0158) 
correlated  with  changes  in  hepatic  fat  at  weeks  26  and  56  (ALT:  r=0.6203  and  r=0.5145, 
respectively; AST p<0.0001, r=0.7202; but not at week 56 time point: p=0.0634, r = 0.4117).

None of the subjects in the HoFH study pool developed acute hepatotoxicity. No subject had an 
ALT elevation to >3xULN with a corresponding total bilirubin elevation that was >2xULN, i.e., no 
subject met Hy’s Law (ALT>3ULN and Bili>2 ULN). Similar results were observed for AST.

In the hypercholesterolemic population elevations in ALT >3 to ≤5×ULN were observed in 14%, 
2%,  7%  and  15%  of  subjects  in  the  escalated-,  low-,  mid-,  and  high-dose  groups,  respectively 
and  elevations  >5  to  ≤10×ULN  were  observed  in  10%,  1%,  2%  and  3%,  respectively.  Eight 
lomitapide-treated  subjects  had  ALT  elevations  >10  to  ≤20×ULN  (0%,  1%,  5%  and  2%, 
respectively).  Elevations  in  AST  >3  to  ≤5×ULN  were  observed  in  10%,  2%,  7%  and  3%  of 
subjects in the escalated-, low-, mid-, and high-dose groups, respectively, and elevations >5 to 
≤10×ULN  were  observed  in  1%,  1%,  2%  and  2%,  respectively.  Elevations  >10  to  ≤20×ULN 
were observed in 2 subjects, including 1%, 0%, 1% and 0% of subjects in the escalated-, low-, 
mid-,  and  high-dose  groups,  respectively.  The  median  times  to  onset  for  subjects  with  ALT  or 
AST  >3×ULN  were  58,  53,  30  and  22  days  in  escalated-,  low-,  mid-,  and  high-dose  groups, 
respectively.  Median  durations  of  the  abnormal  transaminase  elevation  (time  from  onset  of 
abnormality >3×ULN to return to the normal range) were estimated at 27, 15, 24.5 and 49 days 
in lomitapide escalated-, low-, mid- and high-dose groups respectively.  
None  of  the  subjects  developed  acute  hepatoxicity  or  had  an  ALT  or  AST  elevation  to  >3×ULN 
with a corresponding total bilirubin value that was >2×ULN, thus, no subject met Hy’s Law.

Five  subjects  received  warfarin  concomitant  with  lomitapide  in  HoFH  patients.    All  five  subjects 
were carefully monitored and had warfarin doses adjusted as required.  Three of the five subjects 
completed the study through week 56, but two discontinued during the efficacy phase (unrelated 
to INR levels).  No serious bleeding events were reported. One subject developed ecchymosis at 
the  time  of  elevated  INR;  the  event  was  assessed  as  mild  in  intensity  and  possibly  treatment 
related. Increases in INR were reported in three (9%) of the 35 HoFH subjects. All three subjects 
were receiving concomitant warfarin. 
Vitamins levels: In the pivotal study, the majority of subjects did not have shifts from baseline to 
weeks 26 or 56 in the levels of vitamins A, D or E, beta carotene, or un-carboxylated osteocalcin 
(as a measure of vitamin K) mainly because they received vitamin supplements. Since vitamin E 
is transported to the peripheral tissues via the LDL particle, and due to the LDL-C lowering effect 
of  lomitapide,  it  is  not  unexpected  to  observe  the  mean  levels  of  vitamin  E  decreasing  from 
baseline to weeks 26 and 56. However, this decreased did not occur in any patient below normal 
levels. In study UP1001, one (17%) subject had a shift in the level of vitamin D from normal at 
baseline  to  below  normal  at  week  16.  Vitamin  E  levels  were  also  evaluated  in  the 
hypercholesterolemic population of study CV145-009. Mean vitamin E values decreased during 4 
weeks  of  treatment  but  returned  to  near  baseline  levels  after  6  weeks  off  the  drug,  however, 
without a ratio below 1 for vitamin E to total lipid (vitamine E is transported by lipid particles). In 
study  AEGR-733-004,  dose-related  decreases  in  vitamin  E  were  observed  in  the  lomitapide 
monotherapy groups, however, without a ratio below 1 for vitamin E to total lipid. 
Fatty  acid  levels:  In  HoFH  patients,  mean  decreases  from  Baseline  to  Week  56  also  were 
observed across all fatty acid parameters, with mean percent changes of -25% for alpha linolenic 
acid, -42% for arachidonic acid, -35% for docosahexaenoic acid, -41% for eicosatrienoic acid, -
51% for eicosapentaenoic acid, and -6% for linoleic acid. 
Safety in special populations 
Due  to  the  small  number  of  patients  in  the  HoFH  studies,  a  specific  analysis  of  safety  in  sub-
populations was note feasible. 
Nevertheless,  the  majority  (88%)  of  subjects  in  the  hypercholesterolemic  population  were  <65 
years  of  age,  with  only  55  subjects  being  ≥65  years  of  age.  In  the  lomitapide  escalated-dose 
group, dyspepsia was reported by 12% of subjects <65 years of age vs 0% of subjects who were 
Assessment report  
Page 70/107 
 
  
  
 
 
≥65  years.  In  the  lomitapide  low-dose  group,  nausea  was  reported  for  21%  of  subjects  <65 
years  of  age  vs  7%  of  subjects  who  were  ≥65  years.  In  the  lomitapide  mid-dose  group, 
diarrhoea  was  reported  by  66% of  subjects  <65  years  of  age  vs  53%  of  subjects  ≥65  years  of 
age and back pain was reported by 12% vs 0%.  
There was no notable increase in the incidence of any adverse event for subjects who had a renal 
impairment  (32%)  compared  with  subjects  with  normal  renal  function.  In  the  phase  1  parallel-
group  studies  it  was  shown  that  a  single  oral  60  mg  dose  was  well  tolerated  by  subjects  with 
ESRD  on  haemodialysis  and  matched  healthy  subjects.  Three  healthy  subjects  (43%)  reported 
TEAEs of headache, nausea, and rash and 1 subject (14%) with ESRD on haemodialysis reported 
a TEAE of orthostatic hypertension. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The  relevant  discussion  on  drug-drug  investigations  between  lomitapide  and  other  medicinal 
products  are  presented  in  the  Clinical  Pharmacology  section,  where  the  agreed  post-marketing 
investigations needed for established of lomitapide’s interaction profile are described. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Diarrhoea was identified as the main dose limiting adverse event in phase 2 studies and lead to 
treatment discontinuation in more than 20% of subjects on lomitapide doses 10 mg or higher.  
Four  of  the  HoFH  subjects  experienced  TEAEs  (three  GI  disorders)  that  resulted  in  treatment 
discontinuation.  One  subject  discontinued  because  of  abdominal  pain,  nausea,  and  diarrhoea, 
and  1  subject  each  discontinued  because  of  diarrhoea,  gastroenteritis,  and  headache.    In  the 
hypercholesterolemic  population,  diarrhoea  was  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAE  leading  to 
discontinuation  in  14%,  26%,  and  21% of  subjects in  the low-,  mid-,  and  high-dose  lomitapide 
groups, respectively. The incidence of discontinuation due to diarrhoea was low in the lomitapide 
escalated-dose group (4%). Nausea was also among the most commonly reported TEAEs leading 
to  discontinuation  in  the  lomitapide  mid-dose  group  (15%)  and  high-dose  group  (10%);  but 
none  in  the  escalated-dose.  In  the  escalated-dose  group,  liver  function  test  abnormalities  were 
the most common TEAEs leading to discontinuation (13%); specifically ALT increased (8%), AST 
increased (3%), hepatic enzymes increased (3%), and liver function test abnormal (3%). 
Post marketing experience 
There  is  currently  no  post-marketing  experience  with  lomitapide  since  the  product  was  not 
marketed at the time of CHMP evaluation. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinical safety data for lomitapide were provided for both, the HoFH and the hypercholesterolemic 
population  subsets.  The  first  group  are  patients  targeted  by  the  proposed  indication  and  the 
second subset provides further safety data due to the additional number of patients exposed to 
lomitapide.  For  the  proposed  target  group  of  HoFH  patients,  only  a  limited  number  of  patients 
were  treated  up  to  78  weeks.  In  hypercholesterolemic  patients,  exposure  was  limited  to 
maximum  8  weeks  of  treatment.  Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  this  a  rather  limited  safety 
package, which is, however, justified mainly due to the rarity of the HoFH condition.

Gastrointestinal  adverse  events  were  the  most  frequently  occurring  adverse  events  in  patients 
treated  with  lomitapide.  These  include  diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting,  dyspepsia,  abdominal 
discomfort,  abdominal  pain,  upper  abdominal  pain  or  constipation.  Almost  all  patients 
experienced  a  GI  AE,  which  generally  started  within  a  month  after  first  dosing.  Nearly  all  were 
considered treatment related. In 20% (n=6) of the HoFH patients these events were classified as 
severe.  Severe  GI  adverse  events  were  also  common  in  the  hypercholesterolemic  patients  (9-
28%).  Although  the  clinical  study  investigators  were  aware  of  the  GI  adverse  effects  of 
lomitapide,  due  to  which  a  dose  escalation  approach  in  the  study  design  had  been  used,  still  5 
out  of  6  patients  discontinued  treatment  with  lomitapide  in  the  HoFH  studies  because  of  GI  AE 
experience.  Furthermore,  dose  reductions  and/or  dose  interruptions  because  of  GI  events  were 
applied  in  case  of  twelve  out  of  29  patients  (41%),  which  is  indicative  of  the  severity  of  these 
symptoms  that  interfered  with  optimal  dosing.  However,  six  out  of  ten  patients  with  dose 
reductions  could  be  successfully  re-challenged  to  their  previous  dose  before  the  GI  adverse 
events occurred and five out of six patients with dose interruptions could reinstate the therapy. 
In  general,  the  GI  events  therefore  did  not  diminish  the  overall  efficacy  on  LDL-C  levels  to  an 
important extent, since most patients maintained a similar effective dose as before the GI event 
occurred.  Dose  escalation  is  favourable  over  a  fixed  dose  design.  Fewer  hypercholesterolemic 
patients discontinued treatment (4%) in the dose escalation study than in the other studies (14-
21%) due to GI disorders; especially diarrhoea. Still, the CHMP considered the GI side effects an 
important  limitation  of  lomitapide  treatment;  in  particular  for  clinical  practice  where  less 
intensive  monitoring  can  be  expected.  It  is  also  recognised  that  not  all  patients  could  be  up-
titrated  to  the  maximum  60  mg  dose,  after  dose  limiting  adverse  events  have  subsided,  which 
was related to the occurrence of GI events.  
Therefore, in view of the missing data, the CHMP agreed a specific obligation that the applicant 
will conduct of a long term prospective observational study to systematically collect information 
on  the  demographics,  safety  and  effectiveness  outcomes  of  patients  treated  with  lomitapide, 
including gastrointestinal events. 
Hepatic  adverse  events:  Lomitapide  has  a  considerable  impact  on  liver  function  tests  as 
determined in both, the HoFH and the hypercholesterolemic patient studies. Increases of ALT >3 
to  ≤5×ULN  were  observed  for  5  (14%)  of  35  subjects  in  the  HoFH  pool  and  elevations  >5  to 
≤10×ULN were observed for 5 (14%) HoFH subjects. One patient had an ALT >20X ULN. In the 
hypercholesterolemic study pool, ALT >3 to ≤5×ULN were observed in 14%, 2%, 7% and 15% 
of subjects in the escalated-, low-, mid-, and high-dose groups, respectively, and elevations >5 
to ≤10×ULN were observed in 10%, 1%, 2% and 3%, respectively.  It is important to note that 
eight lomitapide-treated subjects in this study pool had ALT elevations >10 to ≤20×ULN. Results 
on  AST  were  approximately  similar.  These  observations  were  associated  with  the  LDL-C  level 
reduction  and  therefore  suggest  a  response-driven  effect.  This  is  strengthened  by  the 
reversibility  of  the  effect  upon  treatment  cessation.  Although  no  patients  discontinued  due  to 
liver  adverse  events  in  the  HoFH  population,  13%  of  the  hypercholesterolemic  patients 
discontinued treatment because of liver test elevations.  
The CHMP also noted that the observed persistent elevation in hepatic transaminases across the 
studied  populations  and  lomitapide  doses  is  associated  with  hepatic  fat  accumulation  in  a 
considerable  number  of  patients  (8-19%  in  the  HoFH  population  and  5-21%  in  the 
hypercholesterolemic  population)  without  any  sign  of  diminishing  effect  on  liver  fat  over

treatment  time  (e.g.  one  HoFH  patient  showed  increases  up  to  44%),  except  that  fat  fraction 
seems  to  decrease  on  treatment  discontinuation.  Furthermore,  the  elevations  seem  to  be  more 
prominent  in  the  higher  dose  groups.  Still,  no  patient  exposed  met  the  criterion  of  Hy’s  law  of 
ALT>3ULN  and  bilirubin>  2ULN,  which  is  considered  reassuring  in  terms  of  toxic  effects. 
Although  until  now  only  sporadic  signs  of  hepatotoxicity  have  been  observed  (one  case),  the 
CHMP also acknowledged that this could be due to the limited safety database in terms of patient 
numbers,  and  the  limited  duration  of  exposure  for  most  of  the  treated  patients.  Therefore,  the 
impact of these hepatic safety findings for the development and occurrence of steatohepatitis or 
a possible further development of hepatic fibrosis remains unclear. One  case  of hepatosteatosis 
was observed in the HoFH patient population; the liver biopsy, although obtained approximately 
2  months  after  drug  discontinuation,  demonstrated  the  presence  of  mild  steatosis  without 
inflammatory  activity  or  fibrosis.  The  patient  was  re-entered  into  the  study:  ALT  remained  ≤2x 
ULN  and  AST  and  bilirubin  were  in  the  normal  range.  Another  patient  with  severe 
hypertriglyceridemia  was  placed  on  lomitapide  over  13  years  ago  after  a  near  fatal  bout  of 
pancreatitis.  After  several  biopsies  during  these  years,  only  the  most  recent  biopsy  was 
consistent with the development of NASH. However, even in this case of NASH and elevated liver 
enzyme levels, the investigator considered the benefit risk to be positive as the patient was still 
treated with lomitapide at the time of MAA submission. 
In conclusion, the CHMP agrees that the effects of lomitapide on liver, including increase in liver 
enzymes  and  in  particular  steatosis,  are  related  to  the  mechanism  of  action  of  the  drug  and 
generally  show  reversible  characteristics  after  discontinuation  of  the  drug.  The  pattern  of  the 
adverse 
liver  effects 
resembles 
that  of  benign 
steatosis  as 
seen 
in 
familial 
hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL), a genetic condition with alterations in apoB coding that results 
in  low  apo  B/LDL-C  associated  with  moderate  to  severe  steatosis,  but  not  cirrhosis  or  altered 
morbidity/ mortality. However, on the basis of the current data it cannot be ruled out completely, 
whether an individual patient might still develop non alcoholic steatohepatitis, which could in the 
long term result in fibrosis and cirrhosis. The interpretation of the findings remains limited since 
only  few  biopsies  were  performed.  Liver  biopsies  are  considered  the  single  decisive  diagnostic 
tool for detection of liver toxicity. The clinical laboratory parameters and imaging data can only 
suggest  the  presence  of  potential  hepatotoxicity  but  lack  both,  sensitivity  and  specificity. 
Furthermore,  the  lack  of  elevated  liver  enzymes  cannot  guarantee  the  absence  of  liver 
inflammatory disease. Therefore, when lomitapide is used in clinical practice, the CHMP strongly 
recommends  a  close  collaboration  and  involvement  of  hepatologists.  New  exploring  ways  to 
possible detect any progression of liver disease such as non-invasive elastography are supported 
in  order  to  further  aid  the  hepatology  specialist  in  hepatic  risk  assessment.  Further  detailing  of 
liver  safety  monitoring  based  on  biomarkers  suggestive  of  inflammatory  liver  disease  (γGT, 
albumin,  and  validated  marker  combinations  such  as  Enhanced  Liver  Fibrosis  test,  ELF)  in 
addition  to  non-specific  markers  such  as  CRP  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC.  The  CHMP  also 
recommended clear criteria for monitoring of liver enzymes elevations and these are detailed in 
the  SmPC.  Patients  who  do  not  achieve  the  needed  benefit  with  lomitapide  (15%  decrease  of 
LDL-C)  should  stop  taking  the  medicinal  product.  As  described  above,  the  CHMP  a  specific 
obligation  to  conduct  a  long  term  prospective  observational  study  that  would  collect  safety  and 
efficacy data from patients on lomitapide and this will include monitoring of the hepatic events as 
well.

Cardiovascular adverse events: In the clinical trials with lomitapide several patients experienced 
a CV event (5 of 35 patients in HoFH and 3 patients in the hypercholesterolemic patient group). 
However,  association  with  the  drug  is  difficult  to  assume,  mainly  due  to  the  low  numbers  of 
events  occurring,  short  follow-up  and  the  single  arm  design.  Nevertheless,  the  typical  HoFH 
patient’s characteristics with a high risk for CV mortality are likely responsible for the occurrence 
of  CV  events.  It  is  somewhat  reassuring  that  the  rate  of  the  events  seen  with  lomitapide  is 
generally within the expected range for this population. Nevertheless, any conclusion towards a 
either  a  beneficial  or  a  detrimental  effect  on  CV  outcome  would  not  be  appropriate  given  the 
uncontrolled and very limited data available.  
The CHMP agreed a specific obligation to conduct a post-approval an observational cohort study 
with  independent  adjudication  of  CV  (MACE)  events,  amongst  others,  and  compare  this  to 
historical data. This is considered an acceptable approach as long as this information is obtained 
in a structured and predefined manner. The study is expected to increase the knowledge on the 
CV effect of lomitapide. 
Musculoskeletal events occurred in a considerable proportion of patients (31%; n=7) in the HoFH 
group.  Although  a  dose  related  incidence  of  adverse  events  in  the  Musculoskeletal  and 
Connective  Tissue  Disorders  category  was  observed,  only  4  adverse  events  were  specifically 
related  to  muscle  pain.  This  number  is  far  too  low  to  conclude  on  any  dose  related  trend. 
Moreover,  the  description  of  these  events  did  not  really  confirm  a  relation  with  lomitapide,  as 
background  therapy  could  also  have  been  the  cause  of  muscle  pain  as  these  patients  were  on 
maximum background statin therapy. Nevertheless, a warning statement in the SmPC has been 
included  as  lomitapide  increases  exposure  of  statins.  Reassuringly,  CPK  levels  were  not 
systematically increased. 
Pulmonary  adverse  events:  Asthma  and  bronchospasm  occurred  infrequent  in  both,  the  HoFH 
and hypercholesterolemic population. However, respiratory disorders were reported for six (21%) 
of  the  29  HoFH  patients;  nasal  congestion  and  pharyngolaryngeal  pain  were  also  noted,  but 
these were assessed as unrelated to study drug. Negative effect on accumulation of neutral lipids 
in lung tissue was not demonstrated in rat studies based on macrophage function. Phagocytosis 
in  lung-tissue  was  not  observed.  Clinical  data  on  long  term  lung  function  tests  do  not  indicate 
any  substantial  changes  either.  Therefore,  it  is  not  expected  that  lomitapide  has  an  impact  on 
pulmonary function. 
Weight  loss  was  not  uncommon  in  the  HoFH  patients,  with  6  patients  experiencing  such  effect. 
Weight loss was considered drug-related in 4 of these 6 patients and was in order of 2.5-3.5 kg. 
It is thought to be only of limited clinical importance, as there was no substantial change in BMI 
and no patient reached a BMI < 18.5 kg/m2.  
Infections  were  seen  in  a  large  proportion  of  the  HoFH  patients  (59%),  e.g.  nasopharyngitis 
(17%),  gastroenteritis  (14%),  and  influenza  (14%).  The  adverse  effects  in  this  system  organ 
class  seem  to  be  dose-related,  as  most  infections  were  observed  with  the  60  mg  dose.  A  large 
proportion  of  the  infections  showed  an  expected  seasonal  pattern.  Data  are  limited  and  it  is 
unlikely  that  the  infections  would  be  directly  linked  to  lomitapide  treatment.  Of  note,  non-
infectious  gastro-enteritis  could  be  linked  to  lomitapide  treatment.  Serious  adverse  events 
occurred between 10-17% in HoFH patients and 1-3% in the hypercholesterolemic patients and 
can be considered infrequent. These were mostly cardiovascular events probably associated with 
Assessment report  
Page 74/107 
 
  
  
 
the underlying disease state of the patients and   not likely to be associated with study drug. One 
patient died, but this death was not considered to be related to study drug.  
Levels of fat soluble vitamins were evaluated during studies with HoFH and some studies with the 
hypercholesterolemic  patients.  Patients  treated  with  lomitapide  took  vitamin  supplements  and 
due to this intake, no significant shifts in vitamin levels could be observed in the HoFH studies. In 
the  hypercholesterolemic  studies  some  shifts  in  vitamin  E  were  seen  despite  extra  intake.  With 
vitamin  supplements,  vitamin  deficiencies  may  be  prevented  during  the  lomitapide  treatment. 
The need for monitoring of vitamin levels is adequately addressed in the SmPC. A large reduction 
of  up  to  51%  in  several  fatty  acids  was  observed.  The  drop  in  these  levels  occurs  during  the 
initial  titration  phase,  reaches  the  minimum  at  week  26  and  thereafter  levels  off.  However  the 
data  do  not  indicate  that  the  levels  drop  to  unacceptable  levels.  The  recommendation  for 
additional  intake  of  vitamin  E  and  essential  fatty  acids  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  is  therefore 
supported.  Subgroup analyses did not reveal noticeable differences in safety profiles. However, 
the safety database was limited to observe any but very large differences, and therefore caution 
with  use  of  lomitapide  in certain  sub-groups  is  warranted.  The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  adequate 
contraindications and warnings in the SmPC. 
In  view  of  the  above  discussed  safety  issues  identified  for  lomitapide,  the  limited  safety 
database, especially for the HoFH patients, while also considering the high unmet medical need 
in  this  subgroup  of  patients,  the  CHMP  agreed  a  specific  obligation  to  observe  patients  treated 
with  lomitapide  via  a  registry  with  a  special  focus  on:  hepatic  events,  gastrointestinal  events, 
MACE,  occurrence  and  outcomes  of  pregnancy,  long  term  maintenance  of  serum  lipid  levels. 
Treating  physicians  and  patients  will  also  be  issued  with  educational  material  advising  how  to 
manage the safety risks associated with the use of lomitapide.  
In addition, the CHMP was of the opinion that the originally proposed indication is to be amended 
to ensure that only HoFH patients will receive lomitapide. Genetic confirmation of HoFH should be 
obtained whenever possible. Other forms of primary hyperlipoproteinemia and secondary causes 
of hypercholesterolaemia (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism) must be excluded.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included 
in the SmPC. 
Additional expert consultations 
Due to CHMP’s concerns mainly with respect to the safety profile of lomitapide and the expected 
cardiovascular benefit based on the surrogate endpoint of lowering the LDL-C level, the opinion 
of  additional  clinical  experts  with  experience  in  treatment  of  cardiovascular,  lipid  and  hepatic 
diseases  was  requested.  Thus,  an  ad-hoc  expert  group  convened  in  order  to  address  the 
following questions: 
1.  What  are  the  clinical  implications  of  hepatotoxicity,  due  to  fat  accumulation  in  the  liver 
associated  with  the  decrease  in  ApoB?  Only  limited  evidence  is  available  and  long  term 
safety remains to be established, in particular:  
a.  whether  there  might  be  a  risk  to  develop  progressive  and  non-reversible  liver 
damage as a consequence of persistent liver steatosis and whether its consequences 
would still outweigh the benefits of lomitapide if liver damage would occur.  
Assessment report  
Page 75/107 
 
  
  
 
 
b.  appropriate  measures  to  minimise  this  risk,  including  e.g.  close  monitoring  of  liver 
parameters,  serial  scanning,  biopsies,  among  others,  and  whether  patients  at  risk 
could  be  identified  by  these  methods  at  a  stage  where  reversibility  might  still  be 
expected.  
The experts agreed that fat accumulation is a natural consequence of the mechanism of action of 
lomitapide,  and  is  of  concern  since  the  product  is  to  be  used  long-term.  The  clinical  data  show 
increase of fat liver content and several fold increase in the AST and ALT levels in many patients 
shortly after initiation of lomitapide therapy. Moreover, there is no guarantee that apart from its 
mechanism of action (inhibition of MTP) there are no other effects of lomitapide on liver resulting 
in  toxicity.  Furthermore,  a  strong  concern  was  expressed  with  respect  to  the  link  between  fat 
accumulation  in  liver  and  the  progression  of  the  inflammatory  disease,  and  whether  the  fat 
accumulation  in  liver  seen  with  lomitapide  can  lead  to  inflammation  which  can  result  in  fibrosis 
and  eventually  cirrhosis.  Some  experts  believed  that  the  treatment  with  lomitapide  would  need 
to be stopped after fat accumulation is detected and restarted post liver recovery.  
The  usefulness  of  monitoring  markers  of  inflammation  in  addition  to  liver  function  biomarkers 
was also discussed. The experts noted that the applicant monitored some inflammatory markers 
as part of a standard set, e.g. hsCRP, but the direct link between the changes in their levels and 
liver  toxicity  is  still  unclear.  All  experts  agreed  that  the  only  suitable  and  reliable  method  for 
detection  of  inflammatory  steatosis  and  fibrosis  (and  differentiation  from  plain  steatosis)  is  a 
biopsy, but currently, data from only one patient is available. Thus, the experts advocate a lower 
threshold for performing biopsies, and that these are to be conducted in all patients suspected of 
liver inflammation.  
Conclusion:  Considering  the  high  unmet  medical  need  in  the  HoFH  population,  the  experts 
agreed by consensus that even if there might be a probability that liver steatosis would develop 
into  fibrosis  and  long-term  liver  damage  cannot  be  completely  ruled  out  based  on  the  data 
available  to  date,  there  could  be  a  benefit  for  use  of  lomitapide.    In  order  to  achieve  this 
assumed clinical benefit, the applicant must implement the following risk minimisation measures 
to monitor the hepatic effects of lomitapide, in order to minimise the risk of progression of liver 
steatosis into fibrosis: 
−  Patient monitoring shall be conducted in specialised centres and all patients shall be 
included in a registry.  
−  The applicant should identify the most sensitive liver biomarkers suggestive of 
inflammatory liver disease (e.g. γGT, albumin, and validated marker combinations such 
as the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis test, ELF), in addition to non-specific inflammatory 
markers (e.g. CRP, TNFα, IL-6), and their regular monitoring is mandatory.  
− 
In addition, monitoring using at least one imaging technique (e.g., elastography with 
validated software such as CAP) is essential.  
−  The threshold for referring patients to a hepatologist and the conduct of biopsy must be 
lowered in order to ensure earlier identification of potential signs of liver inflammation.  
These measures can be revisited at a later stage when more data become available.  
Furthermore, the current SmPC wording on alcohol consumption shall be strengthened in order 
to limit this even further.

2. 
Is  there  scope  to  use  specific  genetic  and/or  clinical  diagnostic  criteria  (such  as 
documented  functional  mutation  in  LDL  receptor  alleles  and  alleles  known  to  affect  LDL 
receptor  functionality,  levels  of  untreated  or  treated  total  or  LDL  cholesterol,  presence  of 
xanthomas, or family history of familial hypercholesterolaemia for both parents) to better 
define  the  HoFH  population  in  order  to  ensure  that  only  these  patients  will  receive 
lomitapide?  
In general, the experts believed that a combination of genetic confirmation of the HoFH and a 
clinical proof of the increased LDL-C level should be recommended for identification of the most 
appropriate patient population for the treatment with lomitapide. 
Based on the above, the criteria as proposed by the applicant should be strengthened to avoid 
that broader population (e.g. patients with HeFH) would be incorrectly treated with lomitapide. 
The following changes are recommended: 
− 
the quantification as proposed by the applicant based on untreated total cholesterol ≥ 13 
mmol/L (500 mg/dL) should be deleted, since blood cholesterol levels can be higher in 
type 1, 3, 4 or5 hyperlipoproteinemia patients not suffering from FH, and therefore, this 
parameter is not reflective of the adequate medical need. 
the criterion of untreated total cholesterol should be replaced by untreated LDL-C ≥ 10.4 
− 
mmol/L (400 mg/dL). 
the proposed limit of treated LDL-C ≥ 7.8 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) should be maintained. 
− 
−  DNA confirmation of 2 mutant alleles in FH genes is obligatory, if untreated or treated 
LDL-C fall below10.4 mmol/L (400 mg/dL) or 7.8 mmol/L (300 mg/dL), respectively. 
−  Where diagnosis is based on xanthoma in childhood, this must be confirmed by positive 
family history, i.e. at least heterozygous FH and/or genetic testing. 
Causes of secondary LDL-C elevations (e.g. nephrotic syndrome, hypothyreodism) should be 
excluded by appropriate clinical tests.  
Primary forms of hyperlipoproteinemias which may concomitantly increase total cholesterol or 
LDL-C (e.g. lipoprotein lipase deficiency, familial type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia) should be 
excluded by appropriate clinical tests. 
In addition, the experts agreed by consensus that the SmPC of lomitapide should state that the 
treatment must be stopped if no effect on LDL-C is shown (i.e. at least a 15% reduction of LDL-C 
level). 
3. 
Does  the  available  evidence  of  efficacy  and  safety  provide  sufficient  confidence  for  the 
medicine to be used in clinical practice? If so, what additional data on efficacy and safety 
do  the  experts  suggest  that  would  need  to  be  collected  post-authorisation,  taking  into 
account the limitations associated with the very small target population? 
The  experts  were  aware  that  there  are  no large  randomised  controlled  clinical  outcome  trials  in 
patients  with  HoFH,  and  data  for  HoFH  are  extrapolated  from  studies  in  different  (combined) 
populations.  Despite  the  limited  data,  the  experts  stated  their  confidence  that  currently,  the 
Assessment report  
Page 77/107 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
expectance  of  a  clinical  effect  in  terms  of  possible  cardiovascular  benefit  is  reasonable  with  the 
observed LDL-C lowering effect of lomitapide, and the benefit/risk profile of lomitapide could be 
positive,  provided  adequate  risk  minimization  measures  for  hepatotoxicity  and  drug-drug 
interactions  are  agreed.  Nevertheless,  further  clinical  evidence  on  cardiovascular  surrogate 
endpoints should be collected post-authorisation during long-term use. 
In  the  HoFH  population,  there  is  a  high  burden  of  atherosclerosis  and  cardiovascular 
complications  in  patients  already  before  even  starting  treatment  with  lomitapide,  and  thus,  the 
clinical benefit of lomitapide on the longer-term must be proven. While the experts acknowledged 
that  performance  of  a  controlled,  randomized  study  with  hard  clinical  endpoints  in  order  to 
confirm cardiovascular benefit of lomitapide in HoFH patients would be difficult or even unethical, 
collection  of  long  term  cardiovascular  outcome  data  can  be  achieved  indirectly  by  long-term 
monitoring  (~  5  years)  of  the  vascular  outcomes  using  appropriate  and  scientifically  validated 
imaging  techniques  or  other  acknowledged  vascular  surrogate  endpoints  such  as  endothelial 
function.  
The  experts  concluded  that  the  post-approval  registry  suggested  for  all  patients  treated  with 
lomitapide  should  be  accompanied  by  a  clinical  study  with  active  long-term  monitoring  of 
cardiovascular benefits. The experts strongly advise that the applicant should design a study with 
adequate surrogate endpoints on vascular outcomes using imaging techniques of atherosclerosis 
burden  (such  as  MRI,  intravascular  ultrasound,  etc.)  or  vascular  function.  The  study  should  be 
adequately  powered  and  standardized  collection  of  cardiovascular  events  is  to  be  ensured.  The 
applicant  could  also  consider  investigations  of  disease  stabilization  or  demonstration  of 
regression. The protocol of the study should be agreed with the CHMP. 
4. 
Do  the  experts  have  any  comments  on  the  potential  clinical  impact  of  the  'drug-drug 
interaction'  with  CYP3A4  inhibitors,  including  weak  inhibitors,  and  any  suggestions  as  to 
how the risks of increased exposure should be handled in clinical practice? 
Given the HoFH condition and the likelihood of the patients being treated with several medicinal 
products  concomitantly,  the  potential  impact  of  interactions  with  lomitapide  (metabolised 
primarily  via  CYP3A4)  are  not  negligible.  The  experts  noted  that  use  of  lomitapide  is 
contraindicated  with  strong  and  moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitors,  however,  reliable  data  on  weak 
CYP3A4  inhibitors  are  lacking  (only  simulations  from  an  insufficiently  validated  PK  model  were 
submitted.) 
It  should  also  be  considered  that  treatment  with  lomitapide  foresees  gradual  dose  titration  and 
the effect of adding a CYP3A4 inhibitor can be different at each stage of titrating. The interaction 
is  expected  to  lead  to  a  two-fold  increase  in  exposure  of  lomitapide  (estimated  from  a  cross-
study  comparison  to  be  the  maximum  increase  following  co-administration  with  a  single  weak 
CYP3A4  inhibitor  and  consequent  increases  of  AST  and  ALT  levels  as  well  as  increased 
gastrointestinal toxicity. It is of note that the applicant proposed to half the lomitapide (~30 mg) 
during  the  concomitant  use  of  lomitapide  and  such  inhibitors,  but  no  supportive  clinical  data 
exist. Some experts suggested interrupting the treatment of lomitapide during administration of 
a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor(s). 
Assessment report  
Page 78/107 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
In conclusion: 
− 
It is agreed to contraindicate the concomitant use of moderate and strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors and lomitapide. 
−  An adequately designed PK study in an appropriate patient population must be 
committed to conduct with a concomitant administration of two weak CYP3A4 inhibitors 
on top of lomitapide.  The two weak CYP3A4 inhibitors should be selected among those 
most likely to be co-administered with lomitapide (e.g. atorvastatin, oral contraception, 
and platelet inhibitors like clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor). 
−  The wording in the SmPC of lomitapide should be strengthened: all patients with 
concomitant use of weak CYP3A4 inhibitor(s) should be closely monitored. Special 
attention should be given to patients optimally titrated on lomitapide, but who are 
subsequently administered a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
−  The applicant’s proposals for educational material for physicians and patients (Wallet 
card) to warn on risks of interactions are strongly supported. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of an MA under exceptional circumstances 
The  applicant  did  not  provide  results  from  a  full  clinical  development  with  lomitapide  and  the 
CHMP  agreed  with  the  applicant’s  argument  that  the  patient  population  of  lomitapide  is 
encountered  so  rarely  that  the  applicant  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  provide 
comprehensive  clinical  data  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  this  medicinal product.  The  true  long-
term impact of the above discussed effects is not known yet and thus, warrant collection of such 
information  during  the  post-authorisation  phase.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considers  the  following 
measures  necessary  to  address  the  missing  safety  data  in  the  context  of  an  MA  under 
exceptional circumstances: 
The applicant shall set up a long term prospective observational study to systematically collect 
information on the safety and effectiveness outcomes of patients treated with lomitapide.  
The objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the occurrence of the following in patients treated with lomitapide: 
o  Hepatic events 
o  Gastrointestinal events 
o  Small bowel, hepatic, colorectal and pancreatic tumours  
o  Events associated with coagulopathy  
o  Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) events  
o  Death, including cause of death 
• To evaluate the occurrence and outcomes of pregnancy in females of reproductive potential 
treated with lomitapide who decide to continue the pregnancy following advice from a 
teratologist.  
• To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of lomitapide in maintaining control of serum lipid 
levels in clinical practice. 
• To evaluate whether prescribers of lomitapide are following the screening and monitoring 
recommendations as specified in the product information and the educational materials. 
These specific obligations shall be annually reassessed.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Although  the  safety  data  from  clinical  studies  conducted  with  lomitapide  are  limited,  the 
observed safety profile does to some extent limit the continued and long term use of lomitapide. 
In  terms  of  tolerability,  the  GI  symptoms  often  result  in  periods  of  dose  interruption  and  dose 
reduction  and  in  some  cases  to  treatment  discontinuation.  However,  it  is  noted  that  a  serious 
impact on  the  observed  efficacy  should  not  be  evident  as  most  patients  can  be  successfully  re-
challenged  and  the  overall  effect  on  the  LDL-C  levels  appears  to  be  minor.  The  GI  symptoms 
were also an important reason why not all patients were treated with the maximum dose.  
Liver  safety  remains  undetermined  because  data  on  long  term  effects  of  the  observed 
considerable  impact  on  transaminase  levels  and  durable  increase  in  hepatic  fat  content  are 
unknown.  The  CHMP  recommended  a  close  collaboration  between  the  treating  physician 
monitoring the patient’s liver enzymes levels (as per the SmPC) and the specialised hepatologist 
to  whom  the  patient  might  be  referred,  as  stated  in  the  SmPC.  New,  exploring  ways  to  detect 
any  progression  of  liver  disease,  such  as  non-invasive  elastography,  are  also  foreseen  and  can 
further aid the hepatologist in hepatic risk assessment. The SmPC details the need for monitoring 
of  hepatic  biomarkers  suggestive  of  inflammatory  liver  disease  (γGT,  albumin,  and  validated 
marker  combinations  such  as  Enhanced  Liver  Fibrosis  test,  ELF)  in  addition  to  the  non-specific 
markers  such  as  CRP  and  TNFα.  Although  these  and  other  safety  issues,  such  as  potential 
vitamin and essential fatty acids depletion or weight loss, seem to be manageable, the true long 
term impact of these effects warrant intense monitoring and will be reviewed by the CHMP during 
annual reassessments.  
Furthermore, the dose escalation approach for patients starting lomitapide treatment appears to 
be  an  additional  reasonable  method  for  managing  the  above  described  adverse  reactions.  All 
physicians  and  patients  will  also  receive  educational  material  explaining  the  risk  minimisation 
activities needed for ensuring safe treatment with lomitapide.  
The revised, restricted indication of lomitapide directing the use of this medicinal product to the 
most  appropriate  patient  population,  along  with  the  thorough  liver  function  monitoring  are 
considered by the CHMP fully appropriate in terms of managing the identified risks. In addition, 
the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of an MA under exceptional circumstances: 
The applicant shall set up a long term prospective observational study to systematically collect 
information on the safety and effectiveness outcomes of patients treated with lomitapide.  
The objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the occurrence of the following in patients treated with lomitapide: 
o  Hepatic events 
o  Gastrointestinal events 
o  Small bowel, hepatic, colorectal and pancreatic tumours  
o  Events associated with coagulopathy  
o  Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) events  
o  Death, including cause of death 
• To evaluate the occurrence and outcomes of pregnancy in females of reproductive potential 
treated with lomitapide who decide to continue the pregnancy following advice from a 
teratologist.  
• To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of lomitapide in maintaining control of serum lipid 
levels in clinical practice. 
• To evaluate whether prescribers of lomitapide are following the screening and monitoring

recommendations as specified in the product information and the educational materials. 
These specific obligations shall be annually reassessed.   
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils 
the legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
PRAC Advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan 
(version 3.4): 
1. 
Based on the outcome of the CHMP discussion regarding the SmPC wording on hepatic 
safety monitoring, the study protocol of the registry and the key elements of the 
educational material should be updated.  
2. 
The summary of the RMP in section 5.1 should be updated with the DDI program as 
additional pharmacovigilance activity for the safety concern “interaction with weak 
CYP3A4 inhibitors”. 
3. 
The term “wallet card” should be changed into “patient alert card” throughout the entire 
RMP.  
4. 
The Applicant should include the following safety concerns in the educational material for 
prescribers (and patients): hepatic fibrosis, pre-existing hepatic disease, concomitant use 
with potential hepatotoxic agents. 
5. 
The key elements to be included in the educational material for the patients should be 
complemented with two additional recommendations  
•  Following a low-fat diet (i.e. patients should follow a diet supplying less than 20% 
of energy from fat), 
•  Timing of medicine intake (Lojuxta should be taken at bedtime with a glass of 
water without food) 
Furthermore,  a  key  element  that  addresses  the  existence  and  importance  of  the  lomitapide 
registry should be added to the key elements to be included in the material for the patients. 
The  CHMP  endorsed  this  advice  with  changes  and  emphasized  the  need  to  align  the  hepatic 
information  to  be  collected  in  the  long  term  prospective  observational  study  with  the  hepatic 
safety  monitoring  recommendations  that  are  included  in  the  updated  SmPC.  Furthermore,  the 
CHMP requested the inclusion of the non-clinical studies investigating drug-drug interaction and

Description and Justification 
Although  this  risk  is  thoroughly  addressed  in  the 
proposed  SPC,  lomitapide  effects  following  long-term 
treatment  are  unknown.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  will 
distribute educational material to prescribers and patients 
to  foster  understanding  of  the  hepatic  risks  associated 
with lomitapide. 
Proposed SPC 
This  risk  is  thoroughly  addressed  in  Section  4.3  and 
Section 4.4 of the proposed SPC.  
•  Section 4.3  
Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and 
those with unexplained persistent abnormal liver function 
tests. 
•  Section 4.4 
Liver enzyme abnormalities and liver monitoring 
Lomitapide can cause elevations in alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase 
[AST] and hepatic steatosis. The extent to which 
lomitapide-associated hepatic steatosis promotes the 
elevations in aminotransferase is unknown. Although 
cases of hepatic dysfunction (elevated aminotransferase 
with increase in bilirubin or International Normalized 
Ratio [INR]) or hepatic failure have not been reported, 
there is concern that lomitapide could induce 
steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis over 
several years. The clinical studies supporting the safety 
and efficacy of lomitapide in HoFH would have been 
unlikely to detect this adverse outcome given their size 
and duration. 
Elevations in aminotransferases (ALT and/or AST) are 
associated with lomitapide (see Section 5.1). There were 
no concomitant or subsequent clinically meaningful 
elevations in serum bilirubin, INR, or alkaline 
phosphatase.  Liver enzyme changes occur most often 
during dose escalation, but may occur at any time during 
therapy.  
Monitoring of liver function tests  
Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, 
gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT) and serum 
albumin before initiation of treatment with Lojuxta. The

medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment and those with 
unexplained persistent abnormal liver function tests. If 
the baseline liver-related tests are abnormal, consider 
initiating the medicinal product after appropriate 
investigation by a hepatologist and the baseline 
abnormalities are explained or resolved.  
During the first year, measure liver-related tests (ALT 
and AST, at a minimum) prior to each increase in dose or 
monthly, whichever occurs first. After the first year, do 
these tests at least every 3 months and before any 
increase in dose. Decrease the dose of Lojuxta if 
elevations of aminotransferase are observed and 
discontinue treatment for persistent or clinically 
significant elevations (see Table 1 below for specific 
recommendations).   
Dose modification based on elevated hepatic 
aminotransferases 
Table 1 below summarizes recommendations for dose 
adjustment and monitoring for patients who develop 
elevated aminotransferase during therapy with Lojuxta.

If confirmed, reduce the dose and 
obtain additional liver-related tests 
if not already measured (such as 
alkaline phosphatase, total 
bilirubin, and INR).   
•  Repeat tests weekly and withhold 
dosing if there are signs of 
abnormal liver function (increase in 
bilirubin or INR), if 
aminotransferase levels rise above 
5x ULN, or if aminotransferase 
levels do not fall below 3x ULN

• 
If resuming Lojuxta after

dose and monitor liver-related tests 
more frequently.  
≥5x ULN 
•  Withhold dosing and obtain 
additional liver-related tests if not 
already measured (such as alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin, and 
INR).  If aminotransferase levels do 
not fall below 3x ULN within 
approximately 4 weeks refer the 
patient to a hepatologist for further 
investigation. 
• 
If resuming Lojuxta after 
aminotransferase levels resolve to 
<3x ULN, reduce the dose and 
monitor liver-related tests more 
frequently. 
*Recommendations based on an ULN of approximately 
30-40 international units/L. 
If aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by 
clinical symptoms of liver injury (such as nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, lethargy, flu-
like symptoms), increases in bilirubin ≥2x ULN, or 
active liver disease, discontinue treatment with Lojuxta 
and refer the patient to a hepatologist for further 
investigation. 
Reintroduction of treatment may be considered if the 
benefits are considered to outweigh the risks associated 
with potential liver disease.  
Hepatic steatosis and risk of progressive liver disease 
Consistent with the mechanism of action of lomitapide, 
most treated patients exhibited increases in hepatic fat 
content. In an open-label Phase 3 study, 18 of 23 patients 
with HoFH developed hepatic steatosis (hepatic fat 
>5.56%) as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (MRS) (see Section 5.1). The median 
absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 
weeks and 78 weeks of treatment, from 1% at baseline, 
measured by MRS. Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for 
progressive liver disease including steatohepatitis and 
cirrhosis. The long term consequences of hepatic

The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily. After 
2 weeks the dose may be increased, based on acceptable 
safety and tolerability, to 10 mg and then at a  minimum

•  Section 4.4: 
Monitoring for evidence of progressive liver disease.  
Regular screening for steatohepatitis/fibrosis should be 
performed at baseline and on an annual basis using the 
following imaging and biomarker evaluations: 
•  Imaging for tissue elasticity, e.g. Fibroscan, 
acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), or 
magnetic resonance (MR) elastography 
•  Gamma-GT and serum albumin to detect possible 
liver injury 
•  At least one marker from each of the following 
categories:

(ESR), CK-18 Fragment, NashTest (liver 
inflammation) 
•  Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) panel, 
Fibrometer, AST/ALT ratio, Fib-4 score, 
Fibrotest (liver fibrosis) 
The performance of these tests and their interpretation 
should involve collaboration between the treating 
physician and the hepatologist. Patients with results 
suggesting the presence of steatohepatitis or fibrosis 
should be considered for liver biopsy.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Lomitapide is an inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), inhibiting transfer of 
triglycerides  and  cholesterol  into  apoB  in  both  intestine  and  liver.  One  main,  pivotal  open-label 
single arm study was conducted to demonstrate efficacy of lomitapide on top of existing optimal 
lipid lowering treatment in the target HoFH population. 
Consistent  lipid  lowering efficacy  was  demonstrated in  both,  the pivotal  study  and  in  the  short-
term  supportive  studies.  Reduction  of  40%  of  LDL-C  levels  was  seen  in  HoFH  patients  after  26 
Assessment report  
Page 96/107 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
weeks  of  treatment  with  lomitapide  on  top  of  lipid  lowering  therapy  in  both,  ITT  and  PP 
population, with a sustained effect through 56 weeks of treatment. This corresponds to a mean 
LDL-C decrease from 336 mg/dL (8.7 mmol/L) to 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L), a mean change of -
146.9 mg/dL (3.8 mmol/L).  
The  primary  data  of  LDL-C  reduction  are  supported  by  significant  beneficial  changes  for 
secondary  endpoints  of  TC,  TG,  non-HDL-C,  apoB  but  not  for  HDL-C  and  ApoA1.  A  dose 
dependent reduction in LDL-C has also seen in other patients with elevated cholesterol levels in 
short-term statin and ezetimibe controlled studies.  
Beneficial  effects  were  observed  across  several  subgroups  of  age,  gender,  race,  BMI,  and 
apheresis. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
It is acknowledged that only twenty-three (of 29) HoFH patients have been treated for up to 78 
weeks  in  a  single  arm  open  label  fashion.  Data  on  long-term  efficacy  of  lomitapide  are  limited 
and  long-term  effect  of  lipid  reduction  of  lomitapide  on  cardiovascular  events  has  not  been 
demonstrated  to  date.  However,  clear  signs  of  higher  incidence  of  cardiovascular  events  in  the 
lomitapide  patient  group were  not  observed.  At  the  present  time,  any  conclusion  on  this  would 
be pre-mature, given the uncontrolled and limited data available. A small proportion of patients 
(n=19)  was  included  in  the  PP  population  analysis  due  to  changes  in  apheresis  schedule  and 
treatment non-compliance. 
In addition to the pronounced dose-dependent GI adverse events of lomitapide, the rarity of the 
HoFH  condition  and  subsequent  difficulty  to  recruit  these  patients,  the  suboptimal  design  of  an 
unblended, single arm trial was necessary, and this could be subject to a potential bias. A poor 
compliance to diet was observed in the clinical trial; however, this did not seem to have an effect 
on the efficacy results. Subgroup analyses were underpowered but did not show any substantial 
differences. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Based  on  the  submitted  data,  845  patients  were  treated  with  lomitapide  of  whom  29  HoFH 
patients were enrolled in the pivotal study. 
Lomitapide  treatment  was  associated  with  a  high  frequency  of  gastrointestinal  adverse  events 
(93%  patients  in  the  pivotal  study).  These  were  severe  in  17%  of  the  HoFH  population  and  9-
28%  in  the  other  hypercholesterolemic  populations.  Five  patients  in  the  HoFH  study  population 
and  4%  in  the  other  hypercholesterolemic  population  discontinued  treatment  during  a  dose 
escalation  scheme  because  of  GI  events,  in  contrast  to  14-21%  discontinuing  due  to  diarrhoea 
during  fixed  dose  supportive  studies.  Dose  reductions  for  GI  events  occurred  for  seven  HoFH 
patients  (24%)  and  equally,  dose  interruptions  related  to  GI  events  were  needed  in  seven 
patients  (24%).  However,  these  were  short-term,  with  a  mean  duration  of  5  days,  and  most 
patients were successfully rechallenged. 
Liver  adverse  events  were  likely  to  occur  (9-34%)  with  lomitapide  treatment,  with  13%  of  the 
patients discontinuing  in  the  other  hypercholesterolemic  population.  Elevations  in  liver  enzymes 
were  frequent  and  seem  to  be  reversible  and  inversely  associated  with  the  effect  on  LDL-C

reduction,  and  positively  associated  with  the  hepatic  fat  accumulation.  Liver  enzymes  and 
biomarkers monitoring is recommended in the SmPC.  Six patients experienced weight loss in the 
HoFH patient population, which was considered drug-related for 4 patients, but without long term 
impact on BMI and no patient’s BMI dropping below of 18.  
Serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  10%  in  the  HoFH  population  and  1-3%  in  the  other 
hypercholesterolemic  population,  and  were  almost  all  probably  related  to  the  CV  underlying 
disease  of  the  patients  and  not  to  study  treatment.  A  notable  proportion  of  the  HoFH  patients 
(59%) had infections, but it is unlikely that they are linked to lomitapide treatment. 
An  association  of  lomitapide  with  musculoskeletal  events  is  unlikely.  The  patients  in  the  pivotal 
study  were  already  on  maximum  background  statin  therapy.  Thus,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the 
SmPC  statement  recommending  that  all  patients  receiving  lomitapide  in  addition  to  a  statin 
should  be  advised  of  the  potential  increased  risk  of  myopathy  and  report  promptly  any 
unexplained  muscle  pain,  tenderness,  or  weakness,  is  adequate.  Doses  of  simvastatin  >40 mg 
should not be used, as per the SmPC.  
The  long-term  effects  of  possible  signs  of  malabsorption  do  not  appear  to  have  clinical 
consequences.  Considerable  reductions  in  fatty  acid  levels  (51%),  mainly  at  start  of  treatment, 
were  observed.  However,  these  stayed  within  the  normal  range  with  vitamin  supplementation. 
The BMI remained within the normal range without the patient’s BMI dropping below 18. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A limited size safety database is available with uncontrolled data of 29 HoFH patients treated for 
a  maximum  of  78  weeks  in  the  pivotal  study.  Data  from  446  patients  with  other  types  of 
hypercholesterolemia treated in controlled studies up to 12 weeks provide additional information. 
Adverse events on liver in the small HoFH population, and/or a limited follow-up time, lead to an 
uncertainty  in  a  reliable  assessment  on the  development  and  occurrence  of  hepatosteatitis  with 
possible  further  development  of  hepatic  fibrosis.  Although  liver  toxicity  is  related  to  the 
mechanism  of  action  of  lomitapide,  generally  shows  reversible  characteristics  after  drug 
discontinuation, and its pattern resembles that of benign steatosis, it cannot be ruled out that an 
individual  patient  might  still  develop  a  non-alcoholic  steatohepatitis  (NASH),  which  could  in  the 
long-term  result  in  fibrosis  and  cirrhosis.  One  patient  had  a  biopsy  2  months  after  drug 
discontinuation, was presented with hepatosteatosis and elevated ALT/AST levels, but no NASH. 
Liver  biopsy  of  another  patient  with  hypertriglyceridemia  treated  with  lomitapide  for  13  years 
showed  signs  of  NASH,  but  the  treatment  continues.  Thus,  identifying  patients  at  risk  of 
developing  hepatotoxicity  based  only  on  elevations  in  liver  enzyme  levels  is  uncertain. 
Association of lomitapide treatment with liver fat accumulation was observed, however, data are 
limited.  Only  few  biopsies  were  taken.  Although  clinical  laboratory  measurements  may  aid  in 
identifying  the  patients  that  need  to  be  referred  to  a  hepatologist,  imaging  techniques  should 
also  be  part  of  routine  monitoring.  Close  collaboration  of  the  treating  physician  with  a 
hepatologist  is  warranted.  New  ways  to  monitor  possible  progression  of  liver  disease  such  as 
non-invasive  elastography  are  needed  to  aid  in  hepatic  risk  assessment.  Other  hepatic 
biomarkers  suggestive  of  inflammatory  liver  disease  (γGT,  albumin,  and  validated  marker 
combinations such as Enhanced Liver Fibrosis test, ELF) in addition to non-specific markers such 
as CRP and TNFα will be monitored. 
Assessment report  
Page 98/107 
 
  
  
 
A  limited  number  of  the  other  hypercholesterolemic  population  experienced  a  CV  event  (n=3) 
that was possibly related to the background risk of the patients.  
No  malignancies  have  been  observed  in  clinical  setting,  however,  in  non-clinical  studies,  long-
term  fat  accumulation  as  well  as  an  increased  number  of  tumours  was  observed  in  liver,  small 
intestine and pancreas. Fatty liver in itself might be a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Lomitapide  exposure  is  highly  sensitive  to  co-administration  with  CYP3A  inhibitors.    While  the 
effect  of  the  strong  CYP3A  inhibitor  on  lomitapide  exposure  (27-fold  increase)  is  quantified,  no 
appropriately controlled studies of moderate or weak inhibitors were undertaken.  Based on the 
magnitude  of  the  interaction  with  the  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor  ketoconazole,  other  strong  and 
moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitors  are  expected  to  have  a  substantial  impact  on  lomitapide’s  PK  and 
the use of moderate and strong Cyp 3A4 inhibitors is therefore contraindicated.    
Weak  CYP3A4  inhibitors  are  predicted  to  have  a  substantial  impact  on  lomitapide’s  PK.  A  4-10 
fold increase of lomitapide exposure can be expected based on the results of the study with the 
strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor  ketoconazole  and  on  historical  data  for  the  model  CYP  3A4  probe 
midazolam.  As  lomitapide  is  likely  to  be  co-administered  with  weak  CYP3A  inhibitors,  such  as 
simvastatin, atorvastatin and oral contraceptives, a 5 mg starting dose and careful up-titration of 
lomitapide is recommended when lomitapide is added to a weak CYP 3A4 inhibitor. When a weak 
CYP 3A4 inhibitor is added to lomitapide, dose reduction of lomitapide is recommended, followed 
by careful uptitration. In addition, post-approval two drug-drug interaction studies with the weak 
CYP3A4 inhibitors will be conducted in post-authorisation phase to further investigate this issue.  
In  animal  studies,  lomitapide  was  shown  to  be  highly  concentrated  (200-fold)  in  the  liver  and 
since this is the main site of action, the CHMP considered it important to understand if the drug is 
also  concentrated  in  the  liver  of  humans.  Thus,  evaluations  whether  lomitapide  is  actively  or 
passively transported into the liver at clinically relevant concentrations will be conducted in post-
authorisation phase. 
Furthermore, defining the target population based on genetic and/or clinical diagnostic criteria is 
needed to ensure that only the relevant HoFH patients receive lomitapide. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Lomitapide  demonstrated  clinically  significant  reductions  in  LDL-C  levels  in  HoFH  patients 
(n=29),  a  population  at  high  risk  for  CV  events.  Efficacy  was  shown  in  other  types  of 
hypercholesterolemic  patients  as  well.  Although  the  long-term  effect  of  lipid  reduction  of 
lomitapide  on  CV  events  was  not  investigated,  reduction  in  LDL-cholesterol  is  considered  an 
important  surrogate  endpoint  with  potential  benefits  in  terms  of  CV  outcome.  However,  this 
remains  to  be  investigated  in  the  post-authorisation  setting  since  at  present,  the  uncontrolled 
studies  and  the  small  number  of  patients  studied  do  not  allow  to  conclude  on  the  long  term 
effect. 
The  long-term  beneficial  CV  effects  were  thus  not  fully  demonstrated,  although  in  terms  of 
safety,  the  rate  of  events  seen  with  lomitapide  is  generally  within  the  expected  range  for  this 
population. However, at present, only uncontrolled and limited data available. The applicant will 
thus  conduct  a  post-approval  observational  cohort  study  (as  the  specific  obligation)  with 
Assessment report  
Page 99/107 
 
  
  
 
independent  adjudication  of  CV  (MACE)  events,  amongst  others,  and  compare  this  to  historical 
data.  In  addition,  a  clinical  study  using  imaging  techniques  to  visualize  atherosclerosis  will  also 
be performed, and is expected to provide early data of potential CV benefit of lomitapide. 
Occurrence  of  GI  side  effects  is  a  drawback  of  lomitapide  treatment,  but  this  may  be  partly 
ameliorated  by  using  a  dose  escalation  scheme  as  recommended  in  the  SmPC.  Severe  GI 
adverse  events  that  occur  mostly  at  start  of  treatment,  are  considered  manageable  for  most 
patients by temporary treatment discontinuation or temporary down titration of the dose.  
A further important safety issue is the adverse effect of lomitapide on the liver and although this 
is  related  to the  pharmacodynamic  effect of  lomitapide, the  potential  long-term  development  of 
hepatotoxic  effects,  such  as  fibrosis  cannot  be  currently  assessed,  due  to  limited  data.  Liver 
enzyme  levels,  fat  fraction  or  other  imaging  markers  are  not  a  reliable  predictor  of  such 
hepatotoxic  effects  either.  As  stated  in  the  SmPC,  other  hepatic  biomarkers  suggestive  of 
inflammatory  liver  disease  (γGT,  albumin,  and  validated  marker  combinations  such  as  ELF)  in 
addition  to  non-specific  markers  such  as  CRP  and  TNFα,  and  the  use  of  at  least  one  imaging 
technique,  e.g.  elastography,  is  considered  essential.  The  observed  hepatosteatosis  resembles 
that  of  benign  steatosis  as  seen  in  familial  hypobetalipoproteinemia  (FHBL),  a  genetic  condition 
with  alterations  in  apoB  coding  that  results  in  low  apo  B/LDL-C  associated  with  moderate  to 
severe steatosis, but not cirrhosis or altered morbidity/mortality. However, it cannot be ruled out 
that  the  long-term  treatment  with  lomitapide  could  lead  to  NASH  and  ultimately  fibrosis.  Thus, 
the  CHMP  considered  necessary  to  monitor  the  hepatic  markers  during  lomitapide  treatment  as 
described above, in order to detect early signs and symptoms of serious hepatotoxicity. Referral 
to a hepatologist is recommended, and a liver biopsy should be considered at an early stage of 
liver  damage  suspicion.  If  the  first  biopsy  shows  inflammatory  liver  disease,  the  benefit/risk 
should be re-assessed and treatment be stopped if necessary.  
Further safety information (gastrointestinal, liver cardiovascular effects) will continuously become 
available through the planned registry, as described under the specific obligation.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considered the beneficial effect of lomitapide on LDL-cholesterol clinically relevant, but 
a  benefit  in  terms  of  CV  outcome  remains  to  be  confirmed  and  may  be  partly  offset  by  safety 
issues, in particular hepatic effects. Tolerability issues, specifically the gastrointestinal complaints 
associated  with  lomitapide-treatment  can  lead  in  some  cases  to  suboptimal  dose  titration  and 
drop-outs  during  the  long-term  treatment.  As  the  drug  is  a  sensitive  CYP3A4  substrate, 
interactions  with  weak  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  may  result  in  clinically  important  increases  in 
lomitapide  exposure,  with  a  potential  impact  on  tolerability  and  safety.  Therefore,  routine  risk 
minimisation measures were implemented.  
Given  these  important  safety  issues  with lomitapide,  the  definition of  the target  population  was 
considered  essential  to  ensure  that  only  HoFH  patients  that  are  most  likely  to  benefit  from  the 
treatment will receive the drug.  
Given  the  unmet  medical  need  in  this  rare  condition  (HoFH)  and  the  fact  that  the  applicant 
cannot  be  reasonably expected  to  provide  a  full  set  of safety and efficacy data, the benefit/risk 
balance of lomitapide in the restricted indication is positive, providing the appropriate monitoring 
for  and  management  of  hepatotoxicity  and  gastrointestinal  adverse  events  is  followed.  In 
Assessment report  
Page 100/107 
 
  
  
 
addition, further reassurance of the beneficial effects or at least absence of harm in terms of CV 
outcome  will  be  examined  post-approval,  via  observational  registry  and  an  agreed  clinical  trial 
measuring vascular outcomes. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
HoFH  patients  are  from  an  early  age  at  a  greatly  increased  cardiovascular  risk  due  to  highly 
elevated  LDL-C  levels,  which  usually  remain  elevated  throughout  their  lifetime,  even  if  treated 
with  aggressive  lipid  lowering  therapy.  Treatment  of  these  patients  is  complicated  and  current 
treatment  options  are  limited.  Apheresis  is  available  in  some  specialised  clinics  only,  is  time 
consuming  and  burdensome  to  the  patient.  Therefore,  there  is  an  unmet  medical  need  in  the 
HoFH population and additional long-term therapeutic options are needed.  
Gastrointestinal adverse effects observed with lomitapide can decrease its tolerability, but with a 
dose escalation approach and temporary dose interruptions, could be considered acceptable and 
under these conditions would not significantly affect the B/R balance of lomitapide.  However, a 
potential hepatotoxic effect does affect the B/R balance. Long-term liver effects are unknown and 
monitoring of standard liver enzymes (ALT, AST) alone cannot be considered a reliable indication 
of liver disease. Thorough and regular monitoring of appropriate liver biomarkers, employment of 
imaging  techniques,  possible  liver  biopsy,  and  management  of  long-term  hepatotoxicity  is 
essential since lifelong treatment is foreseen.  
An  approval  under  exceptional  circumstances  is  recommended  by  the  CHMP,  who  took  into 
account  that  a  full,  comprehensive  clinical  data  package  cannot  be  expected in  order  to  assess 
the effects on cardiovascular outcome. This is due to the rarity of the target HoFH population and 
the  fact  that  data  from  adequately  controlled  and  designed  clinical  studies  are  not  feasible.  An 
observational  cohort  study  with  independent  adjudication  of  CV  (MACE)  events  and  additional 
data  on  liver toxicity  will be  conducted,  together  with  a  study  using  vascular  imaging  to  assess 
effect  on  progression  of  atherosclerosis.  In  addition,  patients  and  treating  physicians  will  be 
presented  with  educational  material  aimed  to  minimise  and  manage  the  risks  associated  with 
lomitapide’s treatment.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Lojuxta in the following indication: 
“Lojuxta is indicated as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering medicinal products 
with or without low density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis in adult patients with homozygous 
familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH). 
Genetic confirmation of HoFH should be obtained whenever possible. Other forms of primary 
hyperlipoproteinemia and secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia (e.g. nephrotic syndrome, 
hypothyroidism) must be excluded”

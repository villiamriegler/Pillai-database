Summary of risk management plan for Pregabalin 
This is a summary of the RMP for pregabalin.  The RMP details important risks of pregabalin, 
how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about pregabalin's 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Pregabalin's SmPC and its PL give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients 
on how pregabalin should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for pregabalin should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
pregabalin's RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
In the EU, pregabalin is authorised for the treatment of Neuropathic Pain, Epilepsy, and 
Generalised Anxiety Disorder and (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains pregabalin as 
the active substance and it is given by orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of pregabalin’s benefits can be found in pregabalin’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage link to product’s EPAR summary landing page on the EMA webpage 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-
_Scientific_Discussion/human/000546/WC500046600.pdf. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise 
the Risks 
Important risks of pregabalin, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about pregabalin's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of pregabalin is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of pregabalin are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of pregabalin. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Accidental Injury

risk to the medicine 
Clinical trials, literature articles, and post-marketing data. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Pregabalin treatment has been associated with dizziness and somnolence, which 
could increase the occurrence of accidental injury (fall), especially in the elderly 
population.

Post-marketing data. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Since pregabalin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes 
negligible metabolism in humans (<2% of a dose recovered in urine as 
metabolites), does not inhibit drug metabolism in vitro, and is not bound to plasma 
proteins, it is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, PK interactions. 
Accordingly, in in-vivo studies, no clinically relevant PK interactions were 
observed between pregabalin and phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, 
lamotrigine, gabapentin, lorazepam, oxycodone, or ethanol.  Population PK 
analysis indicated that oral antidiabetics, diuretics, insulin, phenobarbital, 
tiagabine, and topiramate had no clinically significant effect on pregabalin 
clearance. 
Drug interactions with CNS depressants are identified safety concerns with 
pregabalin that emerged in clinical development and in the postmarketing 
experience.  These AEs are monitored and reviewed in the PSUR under the 
heading “Drug interactions (lorazepam, ethanol, and CNS depressants)”.

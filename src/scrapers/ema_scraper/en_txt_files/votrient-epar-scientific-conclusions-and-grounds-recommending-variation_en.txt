Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for pazopanib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Pazopanib has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in preclinical studies. According to the 
harmacokinetic data in humans, pazopanib is eliminated slowly with a mean half-life (T1/2) of 30.9 
hours after administration. Therefore, due to the relative high mean half-life, the PRAC considered 
necessary that patients used adequate contraception during the treatment and at least 2 weeks 
after-treatment. The SmPC and package leaflet have been updated accordingly. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding pazopanib, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pazopanib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pazopanib is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

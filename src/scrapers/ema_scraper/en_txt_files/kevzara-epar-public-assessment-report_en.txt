1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant sanofi-aventis groupe submitted on 24 June 2016 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Kevzara, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 
3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Kevzara is indicated in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or as monotherapy 
for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who responded 
inadequately or were intolerant to DMARDs or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. 
Kevzara has been shown to inhibit progression of joint damage and to improve physical function. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
sarilumab was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0067/2013 on 
the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0067/2013 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance sarilumab contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product 
previously authorised within the European Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Kevzara in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or 
more  disease  modifying  anti  rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs).  Kevzara  can  be  given  as  monotherapy  in  case  of 
intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate (see section 5.1) . 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory autoimmune disease, characterized by progressive 
and irreversible destruction of cartilage and bone and persistent synovitis in multiple diarthrodial joints, with an 
estimated prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 1.1% of the adult population in Europe and North America and 
estimated annual incidence rates varying from 20 to 50 cases per 100,000 1 2. RA has a significant impact on 
numerous aspects of daily life and functioning3. Poor health-related quality-of-life is associated with reduced 
work productivity, absence from work, and loss of work4. The majority of patients with RA have fatigue, which 
has a significant impact on quality of life5, and is rated by patients as a more important outcome than stiffness, 
joint swelling and pain6. Mortality rates in patients with RA are 1.5 to 1.6 fold higher than in the general 
population7. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The pathophysiology of clinical RA is characterized by pannus, a marked cellular infiltrate containing synovial 
fibroblasts, macrophages, mast cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+T cells, natural killer cells, NKT cells, B cells, and 
plasma cells8,9. T- and B-cell activation result in increased production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to 
a feedback loop for additional T-cell, macrophage, and B-cell interactions. Among the many cytokines that are 
elaborated by the rheumatoid pannus, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6 are known to play important roles 
in the joint destruction, symptoms, and disability of RA.

IL-6 promotes osteoporosis and joint destruction in RA by recruitment of leukocytes to involved joints, 
differentiation of osteoclasts, and induction of matrix metalloproteinase production by synoviocytes in pannus. 
IL-6 has been shown to play a role in the antibody production and been implicated in mediating the 
predominance of Th17 over Treg in effector CD4+ T cell subsets, which is thought to play a major role in the 
development of RA. Finally, IL-6 is the major regulator of the acute phase reactants and the anemia of chronic 
disease, both of which are hallmarks of RA8,9, 10. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by persistent synovitis and progressive destruction of cartilage and bone 
in multiple joints. The hallmark of the disease is a symmetric polyarthritis characteristically involving the small 
joints of the hands and feet. The inflammatory process can also target other organs, characteristically bone 
marrow (anemia), eye (scleritis, episcleritis), lung (interstitial pneumonitis, pleuritis), cardiac (pericarditis) and 
skin (nodules, leukocytoclastic vasculitis). Systemic inflammation is characterized by laboratory abnormalities, 
such as anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CRP) and by clinical 
symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, muscle atrophy in affected joint areas. The presence of polyclonal high titre 
rheumatoid factors and anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies provides evidence of immune 
dysregulation. 
It has been estimated that 65% – 70% of RA patients have progressive disease that leads to joint destruction, 
disability and premature death. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Progressive joint destruction is irreversible11 and correlated with long-term disability in RA 12,13,14; consequently, 
therapies that prevent progressive joint destruction and provide sustained benefit over long periods of time are 
of key importance in the management of RA. 
Conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (hereafter referred to as DMARDs), such as methotrexate, 
leflunomide, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine, are the first line of therapy for RA15, methotrexate (MTX) 
being  the  preferred  option  in  either  DMARD-naïve  early  RA  (<6  months  duration)  or  established  RA5.  Until 
recently, treatment with a TNF antagonist in combination with a DMARD was the recommended second line of 
treatment6. The 2013 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guideline broadened recommendations 
such  that  patients  responding  insufficiently  to  MTX  and/or  other  DMARDs,  with  or  without  glucocorticoids, 
should receive a biologic DMARD in combination with MTX or other DMARDs 16.

Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab) were the first biologic DMARDs to be 
approved as therapy for patients with RA. However, not all patients achieve the desired therapeutic response 
with a TNF inhibitor. During the first year after starting treatment with a TNF antagonist, 26% to 36% of patients 
discontinue treatment and after 5 years, 38% to 55% of patients discontinue treatment17. For the patients who 
have an inadequate response or are unable to tolerate a first TNF antagonist, there is some evidence that 
suggests these patients may ultimately derive clinical benefit when they switch to a mechanistically different 
class of biologic therapy (eg, antagonists or inhibitors of IL-1, IL-6, CD20, or T-cell activation), used either in 
combination with DMARDs 18,19 or as monotherapy20,21. 
About the product 
Sarilumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG)1 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to both 
soluble and membrane-bound interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptors (sIL-6Rα and mIL-6Rα) and inhibits IL-6-mediated 
signaling.  IL6 receptor is a known target with respect to the indication rheumatoid arthritis. 
By binding to IL-6Rα, sarilumab prevents the formation of the high-affinity complex of IL-6 with IL-6Rα and thus 
blocks IL-6 signaling. Because sarilumab blocks both mIL-6Rα and sIL-6Rα, it has the potential to inhibit both 
intra-articular and systemic IL-6 signaling. 
The claimed indication was: 
Kevzara is indicated in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or as monotherapy 
for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who responded 
inadequately or were intolerant to DMARDs or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. 
Kevzara has been shown to inhibit progression of joint damage and to improve physical function. 
The approved indication is: 
Kevzara in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or 
more  disease  modifying  anti  rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs).  Kevzara  can  be  given  as  monotherapy  in  case  of 
intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate (see section 5.1). 
The recommended dose of Kevzara is 200 mg once every 2 weeks administered as a subcutaneous injection. 
Reduction  of  dose  from  200  mg  once  every  2  weeks  to  150  mg  once  every  2  weeks  is  recommended  for 
management of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and liver enzyme elevations.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
Legal basis: Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended - complete and independent application. 
During the Clinical development program seven scientific advices were received from CHMP between 2008 and 
2015. Advice was also obtained from national competent authorities MHRA, and AEMPS.  
The design of the studies was almost compliant with CHMP guideline. However, changes in the guidance are 
reflected in the new version not in force yet.  
The Applicant was almost fully compliant with the CHMP SAs, with the exception of conducting two separate (one 
phase II and one phase III) studies instead of the operationally seamless EFC11072 study.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Sarilumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1 isotype) directed against IL6Ra and produced by 
recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Sarilumab is a covalent heterotetramer 
consisting of two disulfide-linked human heavy chains, each covalently linked through a disulfide bond to a 
human kappa light chain. There is a single N-linked glycosylation site (Asn296) on each heavy chain, located 
within the CH2 domain of the Fc constant region in the molecule. The relative molecular mass is 143.9 kDa (in 
the absence of N-linked glycosylation). 
The complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) within the sarilumab heavy chain and light chain variable 
domains combine to form the binding site for its target, IL-6Rα (interleukin-6 receptor α subunit). Sarilumab 
binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 11/189 
  
  
Sarilumab drug substance (DS) is manufactured by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NY, USA). The 
manufacture of sarilumab drug substance is achieved in three main parts, the upstream process, which 
produces the antibody, the downstream process, which purifies the antibody and the formulation of the drug 
substance. Sarilumab is produced by batch suspension culture of recombinant CHO cells.  
Sarilumab protein is expressed and is secreted into the culture medium. The recombinant protein is harvested 
by centrifugation followed by filtration steps and is purified using a series of chromatographic and filtration 
steps.  
Sarilumab formulated drug substance (FDS) is produced at final concentrations of 131.6 mg/mL or 175 mg/mL. 
The DS batches are thawed, pooled and mixed. Following the mixing with dilution buffer and excipient buffer, 
sterile filtration, mixing dispensing and storage of the FDS is performed.  
Control of materials 
All raw materials used in upstream and downstream operations are animal-component free except for the CHO 
cells. All chemical raw materials and the concerned quality are listed. All non-compendial grade raw materials 
and non-chemical raw material with their specifications are provided. The results of a risk assessment covering 
leachables  and  extractables  from  plastic  and  elastomeric  components  used  in  the  sarilumab  manufacturing 
process were provided as well. 
The generation of the sarilumab cell bank system, the characterization and testing is sufficiently described and 
conforms  to  ICH  Q5A/B.  Sarilumab  was  generated  by  immunization  of  Regeneron’s  VelocImmune  mice 
whereafter  specific  antibodies  to  human  IL6R  were  identified  and  cloned.  The  CHO  K1  host  cell  line  was 
developed by transfection and stable integration of sarilumab expression plasmids into the host cell genome. 
The cell line was single cell derived using the Beckman-Coulter MoFlo flow cytometer, characterized for stability 
and  homogeneity,  and  banked  in  medium  lacking  animal-derived  products.  Information  concerning  cloning, 
construction of plasmid, primer expression system were provided. 
A  Master  Cell  Bank  (MCB)  was  generated  and  consequently  expanded  to  a  Working  Cell  Bank  (WCB).  The 
sarilumab  production  cell  line  stability  and  homogeneity  was  evaluated  also  at  the  limit  of  in  vitro  cell  age 
(LIVCA) and the stability of the genetic construct was proven.  
New sarilumab WCBs will be manufactured from the MCB according to approved manufacturing records. The 
procedure to create new WCBs, as well as the storage and use, will be the same as that for the initial WCB. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
For the control of critical steps a cumulative assessment of risk and importance was performed. Critical quality 
attributes  (CQA),  critical  process  parameters  (CPP),  general  quality  attributes  (GQA)  or  general  process 
parameters  (GPP)  were  defined.  In  addition  to  action  limits  or  acceptance  criteria,  control  limits  have  been 
applied to all parameters and attributes (critical or general) that are trended by statistical process control. Hold 
times were validated and are reflected in the limits.  
Process validation 
The  validation  activities  confirm  that  the  sarilumab  manufacturing  process  reproducibly  produces  drug 
substance and formulated drug substance meeting predetermined specifications and quality attributes. Process 
consistency  and  robustness,  including  impurity  clearance  capabilities,  have  been  demonstrated.  Overall  the 
process has been demonstrated to be suitable for the manufacture of DS and FDS. 
Manufacturing process development 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 12/189 
  
  
Manufacturing  development  was  sufficiently  outlined.  Preclinical  process  development  focused  on  increased 
productivity,  process  robustness,  and  product  safety,  efficacy,  and  potency.  All  materials  used  for  phase  3 
clinical trials have been manufactured with the process intended for commercial production.  
Two process improvements following transfer to Clinical GMP Production were performed.  
Characterisation 
The  overall  characterization  approach  is  considered  acceptable.  Extensive  analytical  characterization  was 
performed  which  included  determination  of  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary  structure,  charge  variants, 
aggregation, purity and potency. 
Results indicate that sarilumab exhibits properties representative of a fully human monoclonal antibody 
containing heavy and light chains bound by disulfide linkages.  
The process-related impurities were identified. The purification during the process was assessed. Toxicology and 
clinical profile risk assessment were provided and acceptable daily exposure (ADE) evaluated. 
Specification 
Specifications  were  set  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q6B.  The  testing  includes  identity  by  peptide  map  and 
immunoassay, purity under reducing and non-reducing conditions by Capillary Electrophoresis Sodium Dodecyl 
Sulfate  (CE-SDS),  low  and  high  molecular  impurities  by  size  Exclusion-High  Performance  Liquid 
Chromatography (SE-HPLC), charge variants by capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) analysis, oligosaccharide 
profiling  by  glycan  analysis,  residual  host  proteins  and  DNA,  bioburden,  endotoxin,  general  characteristics 
colour,  clarity,  pH,  total  protein  content  by  spectrophotometry,  osmolality  and  potency  by  bioassay.  The 
selection of tests covers the CQAs that have been defined to be relevant for sarilumab. The proposed release 
specification is based on data obtained from relevant lots of DS and FDS representing commercial lots, clinical 
experience and stability. Impurities have been studied in nonclinical and clinical studies as relevant. Potency is 
determined using a cell-based assay.  
Analytical methods 
Brief  descriptions  of  all  the  analytical  methods  were  provided.  The  provided  details  and  information  are 
considered sufficient. Analytical validation has been conducted in accordance with guideline ICH Q2(R1). The 
validation reports were provided. The analytical methods are considered validated with respect to accuracy, 
precision, specificity, linearity and robustness. The presented method validation results are acceptable.  
The sarilumab potency assay measures the ability of sarilumab to bind human IL-6Rα and inhibit IL-6 mediated 
signaling in a biological system.  
Batch analysis 
The batch analyses of the sarilumab DS process PPQ lots met the proposed commercial specifications. Batch 
analysis results from 175 mg/ml and 131.6 mg/ml formulated drug substance (FDS) were provided as well. All 
batch data confirm compliance to the specification at time of release and thus demonstrate the consistency of 
the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
The establishment and history of the in-house reference standard has been outlined.  
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017

The same reference material is used both for drug substance and drug product in analytical testing and is 
sufficiently described. 
Stability 
The long-term storage condition of drug substance and formulated drug substance are supported with real time 
data.  
Based upon stability data presented a shelf-life of 36 month frozen storage is permitted for sarilumab DS and a 
shelf-life of 36 months frozen storage is permitted for sarilumab FDS. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Sarilumab  solution  for  injection  is  a  clear,  colourless  to  pale  yellow,  sterile  solution  with  pH  6.0.  Kevzara  is 
supplied in two single-use pharmaceutical forms, pre-filled syringes (PFS) and pre-filled pens (PFP), containing 
150 mg or 200 mg sarilumab in 1.14 ml solution (131.6 mg/ml and 175 mg/ml respectively). PFS and PFP use 
the  same  bulk.  Composition  and  concentrations  of  the  excipients  are  identical  for  PFS  and  PFP  and  the  two 
strengths:  histidine/L-histidine  monohydrochloride  monohydrate,  L-arginine  hydrochloride,  sucrose, 
polysorbate 20 and water for injection.  
The excipients are of compendial grade and controlled by the manufacturers using analytical procedures to full 
compendia monograph requirements.  
The primary packaging material for both PFS and PFP is the bulk PFS. Bulk PFS consists of a borosilicate type I 
glass  syringe  barrel  (with  inner  lubrication  with  silicone  oil)  equipped  with  a  stainless  steel  staked  needle, 
protected by a soft elastomeric needle shield (SNS), and an elastomeric plunger stopper (polystyrene). The SNS 
is made of a styrene-butadiene elastomeric formulation and does not contain dry natural rubber, natural latex 
rubber or any of its derivatives. The choice of the container closure system is considered acceptable for the type 
of product and adequate to provide protection from microbial contamination. 
The PFS presentation is composed of the bulk PFS with SNS, a plunger rod (white polystyrene) and finger flange. 
The PFP does not need to have a CE marking in agreement with Council Directive 93/42/EEC Art. 1(3) since it is 
intended for single-use only and the device and the medicinal product form a single integral product which is 
intended exclusively for use in the given combination.  
Extractable and leachable study results do not raise concerns with regard to the container closure system.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturing of PFS is performed at Sanofi Winthrop Industrie, Le Trait, France and manufacturing of PFP is 
performed at Sanofi Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.  The manufacturing process for 
production of Bulk PFS consists of thawing and pooling of FDS, followed by filtration and filling. 
Critical process parameters were defined and adequate in-process-controls were set. The Bulk PFS is defined as 
intermediate  and  adequate  specifications  and  acceptance  criteria  are  set.  The  manufacture  of  the  final 
presentations PFS and PFP consist of assembling, labelling and secondary packaging. In-process control results 
of commercial scale batches demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of consistently generate 
sarilumab 131.6 mg/mL and 175 mg/mL in Bulk PFS in line with the defined specifications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 14/189 
  
  
Manufacturing process validation on sarilumab solution for injection has been performed on three batches of 
Bulk PFS for each dosage strength 131.6 and 175 mg/mL. Overall the data demonstrated that for all validation 
batches the predefined parameters and holding times were met. The process was shown capable of producing 
bulk drug product in prefilled syringes in a robust manner. Media fill testing has been adequately described.  
The impact of transport on product quality, integrity and performance was assessed.  
A Post approval change management protocol was provided to introduce changes to the assembly and labelling 
process for the PFP. The Validation and Comparability Plan provided were considered acceptable.  
Product specification 
Specifications were set in accordance with ICH Q6B. The method of manufacture and route of administration 
were considered when setting release and shelf life specifications. Release tests performed on PFP comprise 
Appearance, Identity by Dot blot or ELISA, and Total protein content and the PFP-specific parameters Activation 
force, Dose accuracy, Injection depth and Injection time. It is accepted that the tests Appearance of solution, 
colour  of  solution,  pH,  Potency,  Purity  by  CE-SDS  (reduced  and  non-reduced),  Purity  by  SE-HPLC,  Charge 
variant analysis, Bacterial endotoxin content, Sterility, Particulate matter, Expellable volume, Break loose and 
glide force are performed on Bulk PFS and these results are reported at PFS level and – except for the last two 
tests – at PFP level.  
The  DP  release  specifications  and  numerical  acceptance  criteria  are  reasonably  set  and  supported  by  batch 
analysis  results.  The  batch  analysis  data  are  acceptable.  Analytical  procedures  and  their  validations  are 
acceptable. It can be concluded that DP specifications have been adequately justified and are fully compliant 
with Ph.Eur. 2031 Monoclonal antibodies for human use and Ph.Eur. 0520 Parenteral preparations.  
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life is 24 months for the Bulk PFS, 24 months for the PFS calculated from the date of fill of 
the bulk PFS and 24 months for the PFP calculated from the date of fill of the bulk PFS. The long-term storage 
condition for the DP is 2-8°C. This is supported by real-time data and is acceptable.  
The distribution and patient time out of refrigeration (TOR), of which the end user may use up to 14 days, is 
acceptable.  
Results from a photostability study, carried out in accordance with ICH  Q1B Stability Testing: Photostability 
Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products  indicate  that  exposure  to  light  should  be  limited.  The  SmPC 
consequently  includes  a  statement  that  the  pre-filled  syringe/pre-filled  pen  should  be  stored  in  the  original 
carton in order to protect from light. 
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
Compliance  with  the  TSE  Guideline  (EMEA/410/01  –  rev.  3)  has  been  sufficiently  demonstrated.  The  drug 
substance  is  produced  in  a  culture  medium.  No  material  of  bovine  origin  is  added  during  fermentation  of 
Sarilumab. The MCB is free from TSE-risk substances.

Virus safety 
The cells used for production of sarilumab have been extensively screened for viruses. These tests did not reveal 
presence of any viral contaminant in the MCB with the exception of intracellular A-type retroviral particles which 
are well known to be present in in rodent cells. This is acceptable since there is sufficient capacity within the 
manufacturing procedure of sarilumab for reduction of this type of viral particles.  
The purification process includes several steps for virus inactivation/removal. The effectiveness of these steps 
(low pH, chromatography and filtration steps) has been sufficiently demonstrated. The virus safety of sarilumab 
is sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  has  been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
A Post approval change management protocol was provided to introduce changes to the assembly and labelling 
process for the PFP. The Validation and Comparability Plan provided were considered acceptable.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  toxicology  studies  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  GLP,  except  for  the  exploratory  studies.  Some 
exceptions to GLP were noted, however these exceptions are not considered to affect the interpretation of study 
data or the scientific validity of the study. 
The nonclinical testing strategy for sarilumab followed a development pathway typical of a biopharmaceutical 
product and is consistent with applicable existing regulatory guidance, specifically ICH S6 (R1) Preclinical Safety 
Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (2011). 
During the development of sarilumab, several scientific advices have been obtained by CHMP and European 
regulatory agencies. The non-clinical programme for sarilumab presented in this MAA is in line with the given 
advice.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacology in vitro 
Sarilumab (REGN88) is a human mAb specific for human IL-6Rα. Sarilumab binds with high affinity to human 
IL-6Rα  and  inhibits  the  binding  of  IL-6  to  its  receptor.  In  in  vitro  functional  assays,  sarilumab  blocked 
IL-6-induced  effects  in  cells  expressing  membrane  IL-6Rα  and  gp130;  i.e.  sarilumab  inhibited  IL-6-induced 
STAT3 signalling in hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells and prevented IL-6-dependent proliferation of human DS-1 B 
cells. Sarilumab also inhibited trans-signalling mediated by the complex of IL-6/sIL-6Rα in cells which express 
only gp130. Importantly, sarilumab demonstrated no agonist activity in the absence of IL-6. 
Given  that  sarilumab  is  a  human  IgG1  molecule,  it  may  mediate  Fc-effector  function  upon  binding  to  cell 
surface-expressed  IL-6Rα.  In  BiaCore  analyses,  sarilumab  bound  to  FcγRI,  FcγRIIa  (R131,  H131),  FCγRIIb, 
FcγRIIIa (V176, F176) and FcγRIIIB with affinities similar to those reported for human IgG1. Binding to sIL-6Rα 
or  clustering  of  sarilumab  with  anti-(Fab’) 2  antibodies  modestly  increased  the  affinities  to  Fcγ  receptors. 
However, sarilumab did not induce ADCC or CDC against target cells expressing membrane IL-6Rα.  
Cross-reactivity of sarilumab with IL-6Rα from non-clinical species was tested in vitro. As shown by BiaCore 
analysis, sarilumab bound to cynomolgus IL-6Rα with slightly lower affinity (approx. 2.3x) than to human 
IL-6Rα. An additional flow cytometry study with PBMC confirmed reactivity of a chimeric version of sarilumab 
with macaque IL-6Rα and demonstrated the lack of reactivity with other non-clinical species. 
Primary pharmacology in vivo 
The in vivo activity of sarilumab was evaluated in humanized mice, expressing both human IL-6 and human 
IL-6Rα. By injection of turpentine an IL-6-dependent inflammatory response is induced. When given prior to 
turpentine, sarilumab blocked the inflammatory response at doses ≥ 1.5 mg/kg, as indicated by a decrease in 
the  acute  phase  protein  SAA  and  an  increase  in  IL-6.  The  latter  finding  is  consistent  with  the  inhibition  of 
receptor-mediated clearance of IL-6.  
Additional in vivo studies in wild-type mice were conducted with REGN844, a surrogate mAb specific for murine 
IL-6Rα. This mAb blocked the interaction of IL-6 with muIL-6Rα and inhibited the IL6-dependent proliferation of 
a murine B cell line. In the model of turpentine-induced inflammation, REGN844 achieved the expected 
pharmacologic effect. Preventive treatment was associated with a reduction in SAA and an increase in circulating 
IL-6. Pertinent to the proposed indication of rheumatoid arthritis, the effect of blocking IL-6Rα was evaluated in 
a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis. In a prophylactic setting, REGN844 prevented development of 
joint inflammation and bone erosion. The study provides proof-of-concept for the inhibition of IL-6Rα 
rheumatoid arthritis. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Literature data indicate that IL-6 plays a role in initiation and propagation of tumour growth. This is attributed 
partly to a direct growth-promoting effect of IL-6 on tumour cells and partly to the creation of an IL-6-driven 
inflammatory milieu leading to the release of growth factors that stimulate tumour growth. Thus, the effect of 
blocking IL-6Rα on tumour cell growth was evaluated in mice transplanted with human tumour xenografts. 
Treatment with sarilumab after establishment of tumours led to a reduction in tumour volume. This correlated 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 17/189 
  
  
with an inhibition of IL-6Rα-mediated signalling and an increase of a marker for apoptosis, as demonstrated by 
ex vivo analysis of tumour xenografts. While the reduction of tumour volume in this study was moderate, the 
data indicate that blockade of IL-6 is associated with inhibition of tumour cells rather than promotion of 
carcinogenesis. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In line with ICH S6(R1) safety pharmacology endpoints were evaluated as part of the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys. This was considered acceptable by CHMP.  
No sarilumab-related effects were observed on cardiovascular, respiratory or CNS functions. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The approved indication for Kevzara is in combination with methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of moderately 
to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are 
intolerant  to  one  or  more  disease  modifying  anti  rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs).  Kevzara  can  be  given  as 
monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate. DMARDS act differently 
from sarilumab, IL-6Rα, thus PD interactions are not expected. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of sarilumab was evaluated in single-dose PK studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys 
after IV and SC administration. The latter reflects the proposed clinical route of administration. Additional PK 
studies were conducted in both species to evaluate PK comparability of sarilumab manufactured according to 
different processes or from different cell lines. Toxicokinetics after repeated administration were evaluated as 
part of the toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. TK of the surrogate mAb REGN844 was evaluated in mice. 
A qualified ELISA was used for detection of free sarilumab in rat serum. Validated ELISAs were used for detection 
of  total  sarilumab  in  cynomolgus  serum  and  for  detection  of  REGN844  in  mouse  serum.  For  detection  of 
anti-sarilumab  antibodies  in  cynomolgus,  initially  a  validated  ELISA  was  used.  Later  in  the  development 
programme a more sensitive bridging ECL assay was developed and validated.  
PK characteristics of sarilumab after single IV and SC administration were typical for a monoclonal antibody. In 
rats, the concentration-time profile of free sarilumab was characterized by an initial distribution or absorption 
phase following IV or SC administration, respectively, followed by a single elimination phase. The mean half-life 
of  free  sarilumab  ranged  from  5.58  to  8.29  days  and  was  similar  following  IV  or  SC  administration.  The 
bioavailability  in  rats  following  SC  dosing  was  high  (≥  77%).  In  rats,  free  sarilumab  displayed  linear  and 
dose-proportional kinetics, consistent with the lack of sarilumab binding to rat IL-6Rα.  
In cynomolgus monkeys, the concentration-time profile of total sarilumab in monkey serum is described by an 
initial distribution (after IV dosing) or absorption phase (after SC dosing) followed by a biphasic elimination 
consisting of a long β elimination phase and a more rapid terminal target elimination phase. The mean t1/2 of 
total sarilumab in monkeys was 113 to 233 hours (4.71 to 9.71 days) at serum concentrations above IL-6Rα 
target saturation binding (7 to 39 μg/mL). At concentrations where target-mediated elimination was a primary 
clearance  process,  a  more  rapid  mean  t1/2  of  35.6  to  69.9  hours  (1.48  to  2.91  days)  was  observed.  The 
bioavailability in monkeys following SC dosing was high (>77%). Total sarilumab in serum of monkeys displayed 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 18/189 
  
  
nonlinear  PK  at  doses  <  5  mg/kg,  where  saturable  target-mediated  disposition  is  a  primary  clearance 
mechanism  at  lower  concentrations;  this  nonlinear  PK  is  expected  in  a  species  with  a  high-affinity  target 
(monkey IL-6Rα) for binding sarilumab. After repeated, once weekly administration at doses of up to 50 mg/kg 
there was limited accumulation (up to 2.8x after 6 months).  
Additional PK studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys were conducted to compare the PK characteristics of 
sarilumab  manufactured  from  different  cell lines,  processes  and  formulated  in  different  formulations.  In  the 
different  studies,  treatment  with  sarilumab  manufactured  according  to  the  commercial  process  (C2P1F3) 
resulted in  a  lower exposure  than  treatment  with  sarilumab  from  the initial  process  (C1P1F1).  However,  no 
differences were observed in the toxicity profile of the different sarilumab versions.  
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1), studies on distribution, metabolism and excretion were not conducted.  
Systemic  exposure  during  pregnancy,  as  well  as  transport  of  sarilumab  across  the  placental  barrier,  was 
evaluated in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, including maternal function (see section on Reproductive Toxicity 
below). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies have been conducted as findings of acute toxicity are rare for monoclonal 
antibodies. This is consistent with current ICH and CHMP guidelines. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicity of sarilumab was evaluated in an extensive non-clinical in vivo programme. Repeated dose studies 
of up to 26 weeks duration were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys which were shown to be a relevant species 
based on binding of sarilumab to cynomolgus IL-6Rα. Reproductive and developmental toxicity of sarilumab was 
evaluated in an ePPND study in cynomolgus monkeys. In addition, the effect of IL-6Ra blockade on fertility and 
juvenile toxicity was evaluated in mice using a murine surrogate mAb directed against mouse IL-6Rα.

In the repeated-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys, treatment with sarilumab alone was generally well 
tolerated. Consistent findings throughout the studies were related to the pharmacology of the mAb, i.e. 
decrease in neutrophil counts, decrease in serum fibrinogen concentration, decrease in CRP concentration and 
increase in IL-6 concentration. In general, these findings were variable, not dose-related and not always 
statistically different from control group values or pre-dose values. At the end of the treatment-free period, 
these findings were reversible or partially reversible.

A total of 4 deaths occurred throughout the study programme. Two of these were accidental and not related to 
sarilumab (gavage error, choking). Cause of death in 1 animal in the 13-wk IV study was gastrointestinal 
amoebiasis. Cause of 1 death in the 26 wk study was determined as typholocolitis, a spontaneous 
gastro-intestinal inflammation as occasionally observed in cynomolgus. 
In studies were sarilumab was given SC, there were microscopic findings (i.e. inflammatory infiltrates) at the SC 
injection sites. In addition, severe diffuse subacute inflammation in the heart was detected in 1 female and 
minimal focal subacute inflammation was observed in the brain of 1 male.  
In the 13 week SC comparability study, a cortical adenoma in the adrenal gland was detected in 1 M in the 100 
mg/kg/wk C1F1P1 group.  
The NOAEL was the highest dose administered and was associated with an AUC0-168h of 381,040 µg*h/ml at 50 
mg/kg/week IV in the chronic toxicity study.  
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted, in accordance with ICH S6 (R1). This is considered acceptable by 
CHMP. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted which is in line with ICH S6 (R1). However, an assessment of the 
carcinogenic potential of sarilumab was made based on literature data on the role of the IL-6 pathway in tumour 
development and on non-clinical data for sarilumab. 
The majority of literature data indicate that IL-6 is an autocrine growth factor in the pathogenesis of cancers. 
Consistently, studies which inhibit IL-6 have been shown to inhibit different tumour types in vitro and in vivo. 
Also studies with sarilumab in human xenograft models show a reduction of tumour growth in vivo possibly 
through induction of apoptosis.  
Results from the repeated-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus do not contain findings which indicate a 
carcinogenic risk, including the presence of a cortical adenoma in the adrenal gland of a single high-dose male 
in the 13-week SC comparability study, given that this type of cancers occurs spontaneously in macaques.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The effect of IL-6Rα inhibition on fertility and early embryonic development was evaluated in mice treated with 
the  surrogate  anti-mouse  IL-6Rα  mAb  REGN844  at  doses  up  to  200  mg/kg/week.  There  were  no  test 
article-related microscopic findings in male and female reproductive organs, except for an increased incidence of 
implantation-site degeneration in the high-dose group. However, REGN844 treatment had no effect on male and 
female reproductive and fertility parameters.  
No  sarilumab-related  microscopic  findings  were  observed  in  the  male  and  females  reproductive  organs  of 
cynomolgus monkeys included in the repeated-dose toxicity studies; however, it should be noted that only a 
minority of these animals was sexually mature. No compound-related effects were observed on the placentae. 
Samples for TK analysis were collected at the necropsy, for males (10/group) at 2-3hrs post-dose; for F (all 
animals) on GD14 (i.e. 7 days after the last dose). Mean REGN844 serum concentrations are tabulated below 
Assessment report

(Table 6). Due to the differences in times in blood collection (which are related to the logistics of the fertility 
study), comparison of male and female REGN844 serum concentrations is not meaningful.

The  evaluations  of  embryo-fetal  toxicity  and  pre-/post-natal  developmental  toxicity  were  conducted  in  a 
combined study design of the enhanced pre- /postnatal developmental toxicology study in monkeys. 
In the cynomolgus enhanced pre-/post-natal development study, there were no sarilumab-related effects on 
pregnancy out-come. The length of gestation was slightly shorter in the high-dose group (50 mg/kg) but still 
within  the  control  range  for  gestation  length  from  the  testing  facility.  The  incidence  of  embryo-fetal  losses 
(abortion, in-utero embryo-fetal death) and neonatal deaths was comparable among the groups. The incidence 
of stillbirths was slightly higher in the high-dose group but still within the range of historical control data of 
facility.  
Toxicokinetic parameters for this study are summarized in the tables below.

No TK determination on breast milk was performed. This is appropriately reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
"Use in pregnant and lactating patients" is listed as missing information in the RMP safety specifications. 
According to the agreed PIP, juvenile animal toxicity studies have not been requested to support the future use 
of sarilumab in paediatric patients. Nevertheless, the applicant has conducted a juvenile toxicology study with 
the murine surrogate mAb REGN844 in juvenile mice, dosed from post-natal day 14 to 70. In addition to general 
toxicity  endpoints,  immunotoxicity  was  a  focus  of  the  study.  REGN844  treatment  had  no  major  effect  on 
lymphocyte populations in peripheral blood, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, also serum IgM and IgG levels 
in peripheral blood were not reduced. In response to immunization with KLH the T cell-dependent IgG response 
was slightly reduced in REGN844-treated males. However, this finding was reversible at the end of the recovery 
period. The study does not raise concern for the use of sarilumab in young children. 
In addition to the juvenile study, the immunotoxic potential of sarilumab was evaluated as part of the 26-week 
chronic toxicity study. In this study, sarilumab had no effect on peripheral lymphocyte populations as 
determined by immunophenotyping. Upon immunization with KLH, sarilumab had no effect on the development 
of an IgM response. However, primary and secondary IgG titers were lower in sarilumab-treated animals than in 
controls, although it should be noted, that antibody responses were not completely blocked.

In all monkey repeated-dose toxicology studies, animals were exposed to sarilumab. The highest dose used in 
IV (50 mg/kg/week) and SC (100 mg/kg/2xweek) studies was adequate to obtained multiple exposure levels 
compared to the ones used during clinical development. The dose of 50 mg/kg/week IV provided exposures that 
were approximately 80-fold higher than those achieved in humans administered 200 mg SC sarilumab Q2W (see 
interspecies comparison section).  
Exposure in term of AUC0-168h after IV administration is consistent across the various studies at the same dose 
(see table below).

Formation of anti-sarilumab antibodies was measured in each of the monkey toxicology studies. ADAs were 
present in monkeys at doses of ≤ 15 mg/kg/week. The lack of an ADA response at the doses >15 g/kg/week 
may reflect the potential for the high circulating sarilumab concentrations causing immune tolerance because 
ADA was not observed in recovery animals even after sarilumab concentrations reached low levels at the end of 
the recovery period. Alternately, the lack of an ADA response may reflect the potential for the high circulating 
drug concentrations to interfere in the ADA assay. The presence of ADAs was associated with lower exposure to 
sarilumab, but was not associated with any adverse effects. 
Local Tolerance  
No classical local tolerance studies were performed. Local tolerance was assessed in repeat-dose toxicology 
studies by evaluating IV infusion and SC injection sites from treated animals (visual, macro- and microscopic 
observations).  
Following SC administration, there were minimal to moderate mixed inflammatory infiltrates at the SC injection 
sites in all sarilumab-treated groups. The incidence and/or severity of the SC microscopic findings were not dose 
dependent, and were fully or partially reversible following the recovery period. 
Other toxicity studies 
The immunotoxic potential of sarilumab was evaluated as part of the 26-week chronic toxicity study. In this 
study, sarilumab had no effect on peripheral lymphocyte populations as determined by immunophenotyping. 
Upon immunization with KLH, sarilumab had no effect on the development of an IgM response. However,

primary and secondary IgG titers were lower in sarilumab-treated animals than in controls, although it should be 
noted, that antibody responses were not completely blocked. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Sarilumab is a monoclonal antibody consisting of natural amino acids, and is therefore not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment. As such, no ERA was performed. 
This is in line with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (ERA Guideline). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical in vitro data submitted demonstrates the pharmacological mode of action for sarilumab as an 
inhibitor of IL-6Rα. The studies provide adequate information on the binding affinity of sarilumab and its potency 
to inhibit IL-6-induced signal transduction and cellular responses. Importantly, the studies demonstrate a lack 
of Fc effector function such as ADCC and CDC.  
In vivo, the ability of sarilumab and its murine surrogate in preventing the increase of circulating Serum Amyloid 
A (SAA) in the Tg and WT turpentine-induced acute inflammation model has been demonstrated. Sarilumab 
murine  surrogate  was  able  to  mitigate  disease  signs  and  severity  (swelling  of  the  joints,  bone  erosion)  of 
induced autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis in CIA model. These data provide a proof-of-concept for the blockade 
of IL-6Rα in arthritis.  
The pharmacokinetic studies performed for this application are considered sufficient for the proposed indication. 
No specific non-clinical PK drug interaction studies were conducted. This is acceptable, since sarilumab as a 
monoclonal antibody is not metabolized via CYP450 enzymes. However, according to literature, the expression 
of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by cytokines such as IL-6. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed 
when IL-6 signalling is inhibited by sarilumab. This issue is adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
To support the safety of sarilumab, an extensive toxicology programme was presented, which is in accordance 
with  current  guidance  and  considered  adequate.  Selection  of  species  for  the  toxicity  studies  is  scientifically 
justified  and  accepted.  Sarilumab-related  findings  in  the  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  were  related  to 
pharmacology  and  consisted  of  decreases  in  neutrophil  counts,  serum  fibrinogen  and  CRP  and  increases  in 
serum IL-6 (when measured). A total of 4 deaths occurred throughout the study programme. Cause of death in 
1  animal  was  gastrointestinal  amoebiasis.  While  the  data  from  this  animal  indicate  that  the  infection  was 
pre-existing,  sarilumab  may  have  impaired  the  immune  response  against  this  intestinal  pathogen.  “Serious 
infection” is considered as an identified risk for sarilumab. In studies were sarilumab was given SC, there were 
microscopic findings (i.e. inflammatory infiltrates) at the SC injection sites. These are considered a reaction to 
injection of high concentration of human protein. In addition, severe diffuse subacute inflammation in the heart 
was detected in 1 female and minimal focal subacute inflammation was observed in the brain of 1 male. It is 
agreed, that these findings can be considered as not related to sarilumab, since they were identified only in 
individual animals and are known as background findings in cynomolgus. In the 13 week SC comparability study, 
a cortical adenoma in the adrenal gland was detected in 1 M in the 100 mg/kg/wk C1F1P1 group. Adrenal cortical 
adenomas  are  known  as  spontaneous  neoplasms  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  The  finding  was  considered  as 
incidental and not related to sarilumab. In summary, in these studies, no adverse effects were observed. The 
NOAEL was the highest dose administered and was associated with an AUC0-168h of 381,040 µg*h/ml at 50 
Assessment report

mg/kg/week IV in the chronic toxicity study. This exposure provides an adequate margin to the exposure at the 
proposed clinical dose of sarilumab (200 mg; Q2W). 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted which is in line with ICH S6 (R1). However, an assessment of the 
carcinogenic potential of sarilumab was made based on literature data on the role of the IL-6 pathway in tumour 
development and on non-clinical data for sarilumab.The applied weight of evidence approach is in accordance 
with ICH S6(R1). Based on the evidence as discussed by the applicant, it can be agreed that chronic treatment 
with sarilumab is not associated with an increased risk of cancer. In contrast, blockade of IL-6Rα signalling may 
contribute to inhibition of tumour growth.  
The effect of IL-6Rα blockade on reproductive and developmental toxicity was evaluated in a fertility study in 
mice using the surrogate mAb and in an ePPND study with sarilumab in cynomolgus. These studies have not 
revealed adverse effects on fertility and pregnancy outcome. In surviving neonates, no developmental defects 
were noted.  
To support the use of sarilumab in paediatric patients, toxicity was evaluated with the surrogate mAb in juvenile 
mice, although such study was not considered necessary in the agreed PIP. The study, with a focus on the effect 
of IL-6Rα blockade on the immune system, did not raise concerns for use of sarilumab in young children. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted is considered adequate. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Kevzara in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or 
more disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Kevzara can be given as monotherapy in case of 
intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate 
The sarilumab clinical program was designed to demonstrate its efficacy in combination with conventional 
DMARDs or as monotherapy for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA in adult patients who 
responded inadequately to or were intolerant of DMARDs (DMARD-IR) or TNF-α antagonists (hereafter referred 
to as [TNFIR]).  
The main studies include two placebo-controlled studies and one active-comparator controlled study.  
Long-term efficacy and safety is investigated in one uncontrolled long-term extension study. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Assays 
Two PK assay formats have been developed in order to distinguish between functional and bound sarilumab 
forms. Both the revised and the original assay were used in several studies including large Phase 3 studies.  
Immunogenicity  assessment  was  supported  by  ELISA  assays,  i.e.,  ADA  determination  and  NAb  detection 
methods. ADA determination method validation (REGN88-AV-10017-VA-O1V2) was based on an ECL bridging 
assay accounting for screening (5% false positive error rate), confirmation (0.1% false positive error rate) and 
titer steps. NAb detection method validation (REGN88-AV-12055-VA-01V3) was a competitive ligand binding 
assay, supporting NAb activity assessment on samples from phase 3 studies that tested positive in ADA assay.

Absorption  
Sarilumab was absorbed well in patients with RA after a single SC administration, with the maximum serum 
concentration of functional sarilumab achieved at a median tmax of 2 to 4 days, with no apparent dose effect 
(Table 7).

Comparability Studies 
Three formulations for sarilumab drug product were used for clinical studies during the clinical development 
program.    The  C2P1F3  drug  product  formulation  that  was  used  in  the  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  is  the 
planned-to-be-marketed drug product. No formal bioequivalence studies between different drug formulations 
and  application  forms  were  conducted.  However,  in  three  clinical  studies  PK  profiles  were  compared  after 
administration of different drug formulations and application forms (prefilled syringe vs autoinjector).  After 
intensive  revision,  the  functional  sarilumab  exposure  for  the  planned-to-be  marketed  C2P1F3  drug  product, 
used  in  the  Phase  3  studies,  can  be  considered  comparable  to  the  exposure  observed  for  the  C1P2F2  drug 
product used in the Phase 2 dose-ranging study although bioequivalence was not proven statistically.  
A higher exposure (up to >20%) after using the autoinjector (AI) compared to the prefilled syringe (PFS) is 
indicated by results from a Phase 3 usability study (MSC12665). After careful evaluation of the supplementary 
information that was requested, it was concluded that the AI-linked higher bioavailability may not impair the 
safety profile of sarilumab. 
Distribution 
Sarilumab volume of distribution at steady state after IV administration (Vss) was 0.0300 and 0.0359 L/kg 
(approximately 2.1 to 2.5 L in a 70 kg individual) at 0.6 and 2.0 mg/kg, respectively, based on observed data in 
6 patients with RA after a single administration. Population PK analysis results (Study POH0490) were consistent 
with an estimated apparent central volume of distribution (Vc/F) of 2.09 L and an apparent peripheral volume of 
distribution (Vp/F) of 6.19 L, resulting in a total volume of distribution (the sum of Vc/F and Vp/F) of 8.28 L. This 
low value suggests that the distribution of sarilumab is primarily limited to the circulatory system. 
Elimination 
Because sarilumab is an antibody, its metabolism is expected to be limited to proteolytic catabolism to small 
peptides and individual amino acids; hence no metabolism or excretion studies were conducted. 
Fast and slow elimination pathways result in an initial half-life of 8 to 10 days and a terminal concentration 
dependent half-life of 2 to 4 days. After the last steady state doses of 150 and 200 mg q2w sarilumab, the 
median times to non-detectable concentration are 30 and 49 days, respectively. 
The  metabolic  pathway  of  sarilumab  has  not  been  characterized.  As  a  monoclonal  antibody,  sarilumab  is 
expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as 
endogenous IgG, and not eliminated via renal or hepatic pathways. 
Sarilumab is a protein which is degraded to small peptides and amino acids, and is not expected to be 
metabolized via CYP isozymes. Therapeutic proteins are metabolized by the same catabolic pathways as 
endogenous proteins, and are typically broken down into small peptides and amino acids via proteolysis. As 
sarilumab is an antibody which is thus expected to be metabolized by proteolytic catabolism, no specific in vitro 
or in vivo metabolism or excretion studies were conducted for sarilumab.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Sarilumab  PK  data  and  non-compartmental  analysis  (NCA)  of  functional  serum  sarilumab  after  a  single 
subcutaneous dose (50 mg – 200 mg) of sarilumab to healthy subjects or patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
indicate a nonlinear PK with target-mediated drug disposition. 
Single and multiple-dose administration resulted in an increase in exposure in a greater than dose proportional 
manner. For single dose SC application, observed mean AUClast increased by 38.1- to 72.3-fold over a 4-fold 
increase in dose over the range of 50 to 200 mg and by about 1.6 -fold over the therapeutic dose range of 150 
to 200 mg. In case of multiple-dose administration, exposure over the dosing interval measured by area under 
the serum concentration versus time curve at steady state (AUC0-14 days) increased 2-fold for an increase in 
SC sarilumab dose from 150 to 200 mg q2w (corresponding to 1.33-fold increase in dose). 
Steady state was reached in 12 to 16 weeks following repeated q2w SC administration, with a 2- to 3-fold 
accumulation compared to single dose exposure for AUC0-14 days and 2.87 – 3.49 for Ctrough values in 
patients receiving 150 mg or 200 mg q2w with DMARDs therapy or by monotherapy.  This is in the range of what 
is theoretically expected from a monoclonal antibody administered q2w with a common t1/2 of 21 days 
(theoretical accumulation factor: 2.7). 
Special populations 
Two population PK analyses were performed to assess the variability of sarilumab PK, and to identify covariates 
as potential sources of variability in sarilumab exposure. 
Sarilumab  exhibited  moderate  to  high  PK  variability  in  patients  with  RA.  Functional  sarilumab  steady  state 
exposure (AUC0-14 days) stratified by covariates indicates that there is a huge variability in AUC within each 
covariate and covariate subgroups. 
The main source of PK variability is body weight with a trend for lower exposure in patients with higher body 
weight which partly resulted from fixed dosing compared to body weight scaled dosing. This is indicated by an 
estimated body weight exponent on CL0/F of about 0.8 (>0.5).  
Body  weight,  ADA-status,  drug  product,  albumin,  gender,  creatinine  clearance  and  baseline  CRP  were 
statistically significant covariates influencing sarilumab PK. 
Sarilumab  exposure  increased  with  a  decrease  in  body  weight,  creatinine  clearance,  or  baseline  CRP  level. 
Sarilumab exposure decreased with a decrease in serum albumin concentration. Exposure looked lower in ADA 
positive patients than in ADA negative patients, in NAb positive patients than in NAb negative patients (based on 
graphical exploration of the post hoc predicted exposure data), for the C1P2F2 drug product when compared to 
other drug products (C1P1F1 and C2P1F3), or in male patients when compared to female patients. 
The  main  source  of  intrinsic  PK  variability  identified  in  the  population  PK  analysis  was  body  weight  (range: 
32-183 kg), with decreasing body weight resulting in an increase in sarilumab exposure. Information concerning 
the efficacy in patients with body weight >100kg is appropriately reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Other  demographic  characteristics  such  as  age  and  race  did  not  have  a  significant  influence  on  the  PK  of 
sarilumab based on population PK analysis. Accordingly, no dose adjustments are recommended for any of these 
demographics. Only 14% of patients were older than 65 years. In total, age ranged from 18 – 88 years.  
Assessment report

Page 32/189 
  
  
Table 8: Functional sarilumab steady state exposure by age category in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis in Phase 3 studies (Study POH0490) 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Administration of concomitant MTX, the most commonly prescribed DMARD for patients with RA, did not impact 
sarilumab clearance irrespective of MTX dose, as assessed by population PK analyses. Graphic exploration of 
post-hoc predicted exposure data showed no appreciable impact on sarilumab PK by prior use of biologics (for 
RA  treatment)  or  in  patients  receiving  sarilumab  in  combination  with  DMARDs  versus  monotherapy.  Among 
patients receiving sarilumab + DMARD, there was no appreciable impact on sarilumab PK for patients who were 
inadequate responders to TNF antagonists, MTX, and/or DMARDs.  
Sarilumab is not anticipated to interact directly with or modulate the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
enzymes, because it is an antibody. However, CYP enzymes are downregulated by infection and stimuli of 
inflammation, including cytokines such as IL-6. Hence, IL-6Rα inhibitors may restore CYP activity to that of the 
non-inflammatory state, leading to restored metabolism of CYP substrates. Elevated IL-6 concentrations may 
down-regulate CYP activity in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions such as RA. Interleukin-6 reduces 
mRNA expression of several CYP450 isoenzymes, including CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. 
Indeed, CYP3A4 expression has been shown to be normalised by another anti-IL-6Rα mAb (tocilizumab) at 
clinically relevant concentrations both in vitro and in vivo. Blockade of IL-6 signaling by IL-6Rα antagonists such 
as sarilumab might reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 and restore CYP activity, leading to restored medicinal 
products concentrations. 
The modulation of IL-6 effect on CYP enzymes by sarilumab may be clinically relevant for CYP substrates with a 
narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. In particular, caution should be exercised in 
patients  who  start  sarilumab 
treatment  while  on 
therapy  with  CYP3A  substrates. 
Indeed, 
inflammation-dependent  reduction  of  CYP3A4  activity,  which  reduces  CYP3A4  substrate  exposure,  may 
normalize  upon  sarilumab  administration.  Detailed  information,  i.e.,  percentage  of  simvastatin  exposure 
decrease, about results obtained from PK single dose interaction study between sarilumab (200mg SC) and 
simvastatin  (40  mg  PO),  are  included  in  the  SmPC  in  section  5.2.  Although  specific  clinical  drug  interaction 
studies  to  assess  the  influence  of  sarilumab  on  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19  and  CYP2D6  substrates  have  not  been 
Assessment report

conducted, it is expected that sarilumab would have a similar effect as that observed for IL-6 antagonists such 
as sirukumab and tocilizumab. This information is appropriately reflected in the SmPC in section 4.5. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis 
of  immune  cells  (both  B  cells  and  T  cells)  and  can  activate  hepatocytes  to  release  acute-phase  proteins, 
including C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), and  fibrinogen, biological markers which reflect 
disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Elevated levels of IL-6 are found in the synovial fluid 
of patients with RA and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and joint destruction that are 
hallmarks of RA.  
Sarilumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG)1 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to both 
soluble and membrane-bound interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptors (sIL-6Rα and mIL-6Rα) and inhibits IL-6-mediated 
signaling.  IL6 receptor is a known target with respect to the indication rheumatoid arthritis. By inhibiting both 
intra-articular and systemic IL-6 signaling sarilumab has the potential to alleviate many of the signs and 
symptoms of RA. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
According  to  the  mode  of  action,  several  PD  biomarkers  were  assessed  in  clinical  studies,  including  IL-6, 
sIL-6Rα, and several inflammatory markers (acute phase proteins CRP, SAA, and fibrinogen, and an indirect 
index of these proteins, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]). 
Immunogenicity 
Persistent ADA response was found to be 4.0% (200 mg q2w group), 5.6% (150 mg q2w group), and 2.0% 
(placebo group). Neutralizing antibody responses were calculated to 1.0% in the 200 mg q2w group,  1.6% in 
the 150 mg q2w 0.2% in the placebo group. AUC0-14 day was lower in ADA positive patients compared to ADA 
negative patients by 20% and 24% at 150 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w, respectively. No correlation was observed 
between ADA being developed and either loss of efficacy or adverse events.  
Secondary pharmacology 
No data on secondary pharmacology were provided. No meaningful effects are expected from the monoclonal 
antibody sarilumab.  
PK/PD relationships 
Semi-mechanistic  population  PK/PD  models  were  submitted  in  order  to  describe  the  relationship  between 
sarilumab  concentrations  (derive  from  PopPK  in  study  POH0428)  and  DAS28-CRP  (Disease  Activity  Score 
28-CRP) and ANC (absolute neutrophil count). These two PK/PD models are POH0446 and POH0429.  
The empirical exposure-response evaluation for efficacy and safety was submitted through the population PK 
POH0455 that was an exposure/response analysis report in which the endpoints considered were both efficacy 
and safety. 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 34/189 
  
  
Globally, a trend for lower efficacy response rates for patients with higher body weight treated with 150 mg q2w 
could be detected. Body weight was a covariate on the PD parameters in the semi-mechanistic population PK/PD 
modelling of DAS28-CRP (efficacy) and the ANC (safety). No statistically significant interaction of ADA status 
(positive or negative) was identified by trough serum concentration on either the efficacy or safety endpoints. 
The power of the interaction test was low due to the relatively low percentage of sarilumab treated patients with 
positive ADA status. 
The efficacy endpoints considered in the POH0455 were American College of Rheumatology improvement scores 
(ACR20,  ACR50,  ACR70),  the  Disease  Activity  Score  28-CRP  (DAS28-CRP),  the  Health  Assessment 
Questionnaire Disability Index for Rheumatoid Arthritis (HAQ-DI), the van der Heijde modified total Sharp score 
(mTSS), and the clinical disease activity index (CDAI). Overall, for all key efficacy endpoints, except for the 
HAQ-DI,  exposure-response  relationships  indicated  that  higher  exposure  resulted  in  better  efficacy  and 
suggested a consistent trend toward a greater therapeutic benefit of 200 mg q2w dose as compared to 150 mg 
q2w; for the HAQ-DI, there was a smaller difference in effect with the increase in exposure from 150 mg q2w to 
200 mg q2w. An evaluation of the impact of exposure on ACR response rates stratified by body weight was 
requested, including the estimation of AUC50 and AUC90 values as well as Ctrough50 and Ctrough 90 values, 
respectively,  which  are  needed  to  achieve  50%  (90%)  of  the  maximum  effect  for  both  envisaged  dosing 
regimens. 
Empirical exposure-safety analyses (Study POH0455) investigated the safety endpoints absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC), alanine transaminase (ALT) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. For percent change in LDL 
concentration and change in ALT (x ULN) and ALT >3 x ULN, there was only a marginally increased risk at 200 
mg q2w when compared to150 mg q2w. Both the empirical and semi-mechanistic PK/PD models showed that 
the decrease in the ANC reached a plateau over the observed sarilumab serum concentration range in the Phase 
3 studies. There was an increase in risk of ANC <1.0 Giga/L in patients at the median concentration for 200 mg 
q2w as compared to 150 mg q2w, especially for patients at low body weight.  
However, the long-term benefit of inhibition of irreversible joint damage demonstrated by sarilumab 200 mg 
q2w outweighs the short-term risk for decreased neutrophil counts, which is transient and probably manageable 
with dose reduction to 150 mg q2w. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Assays 
Choice of screening assay format, acid dissociation step and addition of anti-sIL-6Ra-Ab (capture of dissociated 
ligand:drug) and exogenous IgG (capture of RF) are considered reasonable.  
Concerning  the  immunogenicity  assays,  the  Applicant  was  asked  to  consider  a  more  appropriate  error  rate 
associated to the confirmatory cut points, i.e., 1% instead of 0.1% error rate, and to present immunogenicity 
data according to the calculated 1% false positive rate for the confirmatory assays. The data requested were 
provided, showing a slight increase in ADA rate as compared to the original submission (0.1% error rate) within 
the all analysis sets (Study EFC10832, EFC13752 and EFC14092, Pool 1, 2 and 3). The impact on the incidence 
of persistent ADA, which  are considered the clinically relevant ones, was limited. Importantly, no significant 
effect on sarilumab efficacy and safety profile was observed when a different cut point (1% error rate) was used 
(see safety section). Consequently, confirmatory cut point and immunogenicity data analysis according to either 
0.1% or 1% error rate can be considered overall comparable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017

The Applicant was asked to re-discuss the adequateness of the NAb assay. Despite the overall additional data 
submitted and the Applicant’s justifications, the NAb assay remains unsuitable in terms of DTL for its intended 
use  since  the  drug  levels  exceed  the  documented  NAb  assay  DTL.  Considering  that  immunogenicity 
characterization is a regulatory requirement for biological drug MA, an appropriate NAb test shall be developed 
as a post-authorization measure (recommendation, REC). 
Pharmacokinetics and population PK 
Functional sarilumab serum concentrations in healthy subjects were higher than in patients with RA at the same 
dose of 100 mg by approximately 1.8-fold. This is likely due to an elevated abundance of the target in patients 
with  RA,  as  evidenced  by  about  a  1000-fold  higher  sIL-6Rα  serum  concentration  in  patients  with  RA  when 
compared to healthy subjects.  
Subcutaneous bioavailability (F) of sarilumab was estimated by population PK analysis using IV PK data from 
n=7  patients.  The  Applicant  confirmed  that  the  limited  number  of  subjects  with  IV  data  results  in  model 
instability and the failure to estimate the parameter F. Also, variability of F between patients may contribute to 
interindividual  variability  of  PK  profiles.  Although  it  is  not  ideal  to  describe  sarilumab  PK  following  SC 
administration by the apparent parameters CL/F and V/F, the lack of IV data is accepted. 
A higher bioavailability after using the autoinjector (AI) compared to the prefilled syringe (PFS) is indicated by 
results from a Phase 3 usability study (MSC12665). The Applicant presented further information to support the 
AI vs PFS comparability and it is further noted that study MSC12665 was not powered to demonstrate PK 
bioequivalence. A sensitivity analysis after outlier removal from PK data, showed that the overall difference 
between AI and PFS was only 6-7% for AUC0-τ at the 200 mg q2w dose (ratio: 1.07, IC: 0.87,1.31).  ANC 
change from baseline was slightly worse upon sarilumab AI 200mg q2w compared to PFS 200 mg q2w 
administration (mean percent change from baseline was -35% and -31%, respectively). However, these 
differences could be most likely chance findings caused by limited sample size (n=45 for AI 200mg q2w vs n=53 
for PFS 200mg q2w) and/or variability in exposure parameters. Additionally, the PK/PD simulations of ANC 
time-course profiles that were conducted taking into account up to 20% higher PK exposure for AI 200 mg q2w 
vs PFS 200 mg q2w, showed comparability between the two presentations. Of note, the incidence of patients 
with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in MSC12665 was similar between AI and PFS at 200 mg q2w (7.7% - 7.1%). 
Regarding elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a greater change from baseline in ALT was reported in 
sarilumab 200 mg q2w/AI group than in the other groups. Moreover, in MSC12665 study, ALT elevation >3 x 
ULN was reported with a higher rate in the AI 200 mg group [4 patients (7.7%)] compared to the PFS 200 mg 
group [1 patient (1.1%)]. According to the Applicant, the observed differences could be driven by variability in 
mean values and small sample sizes. Importantly, the higher incidence of patients with an ALT elevation >3 x 
ULN in the AI 200 mg group compared to the PFS 200 mg group (7.7% vs 1.1%, respectively) lies within the 
variability range of the overall safety data in clinical studies. A slightly higher percentage of subjects experienced 
an increase of ALT levels >3 x ULN in the AI 200 mg q2w compared to the  PFS 200 mg q2w, although the small 
sample size and associated variability cannot allow to draw firm conclusions. However, adequate management 
in case of liver enzyme abnormalities laboratory values is reported in the SmPC. In conclusion, the data 
submitted provides adequate support to the AI vs PFS comparability. 
As  exposure  simulations  have  been  simulated  based  on  the  prior  population  PK  model,  the  Applicant  was 
requested to conduct posthoc simulations based on the population PK model that has been built on the most 
comprehensive PK data base and compare results with the actual PK/PD analyses. The simulations indicate that 
no major deviations are expected.

There  is  an  impact  of  covariates  on  PK  parameter,  especially  regarding  the  impact  of  body  weight  on  PK 
parameters for the 5th and 95th percentiles. A descriptive statistic analysis of body weight distribution within 
each level of renal impairment category, to better understand difference in sarilumab exposure among renal 
impairment  groups  has  been  provided.  This  analysis  shows  that  patients  with  mild  and  moderate  renal 
impairment had lower median body weight than patients with normal renal function. Considering the known 
effect of weight on exposure, it is reasonable that the effect of renal impairment on exposure is an indirect effect 
of weight. 
Pharmacodynamics 
PK/PD analyses of biomarkers show a dose-dependent effect, with sarilumab 200 mg q2w being superior in 
evoking PD responses as compared to sarilumab 150 mg q2w, which in turn shows effects greater than placebo. 
Thus, in general, dose recommendations are endorsed. However, the level of effective sarilumab concentrations 
may not be reached in about one quarter of patients with very low sarilumab exposure (e.g. Ctrough levels) 
following both dosing regimens. 
Following report POH0455, it is of note that some covariates were not included in the final models of some 
efficacy/safety endpoints considered. In the description of model development, it is stated that a main effect and 
an interaction effect were considered for inclusion in the PK/PD model if they were highly significant (main effect 
p-value ~0.05 or less and interaction effect p value ~ 0.01 or less). However, in the tables reported in the 
appendixes and related to the estimation and p-value for testing the baseline covariate effect, it is of note that 
some covariates with a significant p-value were not included in the final model. An example is the case of RA 
duration that has been not included as a significant main effect for ACR20 in the final PK/PD model using data 
from EFC10832 (p-value 0.0354; see Appendix A1.6). Other similar cases were observed for the ACR70, CDAI, 
DAS28-CRP, HAQ-DI and ANC. The Applicant clarified this discrepancy sufficiently. There is a strong influence of 
body weight on exposure. In addition, there is a clear exposure-response relationship for efficacy endpoints ACR 
response  rate  and  DAS28-CRP.  Patients  with  higher  bodyweight  are  expected  to  gain  a  less  beneficial 
therapeutic effect. A statement regarding possibly impaired efficacy of sarilumab in overweight patients has 
been included in the SmPC. 
In PK/PD analysis on POH0429, the Applicant was asked to justify the cut-off of maximal 60% maximal decrease 
in ANC. According to the data provided in this study, it seems that the ANC decrease with 150 mg q2w and 200 
mg q2w dosing is essentially similar. As such, a recommendation to reduce sarilumab dose from 200 mg q2w to 
150 mg q2w for management of laboratory abnormalities including decreased ANC has been included in section 
5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, bioanalytical methods were adequately described and validated. The choice and performance of ADA 
assays  are  in  general  endorsed.  While  pending  issues  on  the  adequateness  of  the  confirmatory  cut  point 
associated-error rates have been discussed and considered resolved, the NAb assay remains unsuitable for its 
intended use since the drug levels exceed the documented NAb assay DTL. The CHMP recommended that an 
appropriate NAb test is developed post-authorization (recommendation, REC). 
Sarilumab exhibited moderate to high PK variability in patients with RA. The main source of PK variability is body 
weight with a trend for lower exposure in patients with higher body weight which partly resulted from fixed 
dosing compared to body weight scaled dosing. A statement regarding possibly impaired efficacy of sarilumab in 
overweight patients was included in the SmPC.

Body weight, ADA-status, drug product, albumin, gender, creatinine clearance and baseline CRP were 
statistically significant covariates influencing sarilumab PK. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, two-part, dose ranging and 
confirmatory study with an operationally seamless design, evaluating efficacy and safety of 
SAR153191 (sarilumab) on top of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis 
who are inadequate responders to MTX therapy (EFC11072 - Part A) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Patients with moderately to severely active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX were included in the 
study. 
Inclusion criteria: 
1. Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) as defined by the 1987 revised American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR) criteria with disease duration of no less than 3 months and ACRclass I-III  
2. Patients must be on a stable dose of MTX (10 to 25 mg/week) for a minimum of 6 weeks prior to the Screening 
Visit and intend to continue for the duration of the study. 
3. Patients must have been treated with, and tolerated, a minimum of 12 weeks treatment with methotrexate 
(MTX) prior to the inclusion visit. 
4. Patient with moderate to severe active disease defined as: 
- At least 8 out of 68 joints assessed as painful or tender on motion at both screening and baseline visits, and, 
- At least 6 out of 66 joints assessed as swollen at both screening and baseline visits, and, 
- hs C-Reactive Protein >10mg/L at screening visit 
Treatments 
Patients were randomly allocated to placebo or sarilumab 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg q2w, or 100 mg or 150 mg 
once weekly (qw). 
Objectives 
The primary objective in Part A was to demonstrate that sarilumab on top of MTX is effective on reduction of 
signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at 12 weeks (ACR20 at week 12) and to define the best 
dose/dosage regimen for further development. 
The main secondary objectives were to: 
• assess the safety of sarilumab on top of MTX; 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 38/189 
  
  
 
• document the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of sarilumab on top of MTX in patients with active RA who were 
inadequate responders to MTX therapy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 12 and was 
assessed in the ITT patient population consisting of all patients who had been randomized.  
In the primary approach to analysis of ACR20, patients who discontinued treatment for lack of efficacy were 
considered non-responders; response status for patients who were rescued or discontinued study due to other 
reasons were determined using their last observations prior to the rescue or discontinuation. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed for ACR20 using other missing data imputation approaches. Multiplicity for comparing 
5 doses of sarilumab with placebo was controlled by the Hommel procedure. However, Phase 3 dose selection 
was based on the totality of the data, not merely on the analysis of ACR20 response rates. 
Secondary endpoints: 
•  ACR50, ACR70 at Week 12 
•  Change from baseline in each of the seven ACR components at Week 12 
•  Change from baseline in DAS28 at Week 12 
•  DAS28 remission at Week 12 
•  EULAR response (nonresponders versus responders) at Week 12 
•  ACRn at Week 12 
Statistical methods 
Sample size determination: Anticipating response rates of 40% for placebo and 75% in at least 1 active 
sarilumab group, with 50 patients per group, the study had approximately 80% power to detect a difference of 
35% between any dose of sarilumab and placebo using a 2-sided test with alpha = 0.01 (0.01 chosen to adjust 
for multiplicity) 
Efficacy analysis: Efficacy analyses were based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) patient population consisting of all 
patients who were randomized. ACR20 response at week 12 was the primary efficacy parameter. The primary 
hypothesis was whether there was at least one dose in the dose range of sarilumab tested that was different 
from placebo in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint. 
ACR20 at week 12 was analyzed using the two-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by prior biologic 
use and geographic region. Pairwise comparisons of the response rates between each dose of sarilumab and 
placebo were performed. Treatment effects were described by the odds ratio including the corresponding 95%. 
To account for multiplicity resulting from testing multiple doses of sarilumab against placebo the Hommel 
procedure was applied. 
Categorical secondary efficacy variables were analyzed by the same method as ACR20 at week 12. For the 
continuous efficacy variables e.g. individual components of the ACR20, changes from baseline were analyzed 
using an ANCOVA model which included terms for baseline, treatment, region, and prior biologic use. The 95% 
confidence intervals for comparisons of each dose of sarilumab against placebo were derived from this model. 
ACRn was analyzed using an ANOVA model that included terms for treatment, region, and prior biologic use.

Safety data were analyzed descriptively on the basis of the safety population, i.e. all patients receiving at least 
one dose of study treatment.

Outcomes and estimation 
The highest ACR20 response rate occurred in the 150 mg qw treatment group, and was statistically significant 
compared with placebo (Hommel-adjusted p-value = 0.0203). Hommel-adjusted statistically significant ACR20 
responses were not demonstrated in the other sarilumab dose regimen groups although a trend for treatment 
effect and nominal statistical significance was evident in the 150 mg q2w, 100 mg qw, and 200 mg q2w 
sarilumab treatment arms. The sarilumab 100 mg q2w dose regimen did not show a statistical difference versus 
the placebo for the primary endpoint and was assessed as the no effect dose. With respect to the other 
endpoints, the 150 mg once weekly dose was not more effective than some of the lower doses evaluated. The 
ACR50 response rates were highest for the 100 mg qw (nominal p = 0.0062) and 200 mg q2w (nominal p = 
0.0038) groups. The response rate of patients achieving ACR70 at Week 12 was also highest in the 200 mg q2w 
group with nominal p = 0.0078 compared with placebo.

Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 47/189 
  
  
Secondary objectives: To demonstrate that sarilumab added to MTX is effective in induction of a major clinical 
response at 52 weeks, to assess the safety of sarilumab added to MTX, and to document the pharmacological 
profile of sarilumab added to MTX in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who are inadequate responders to 
MTX therapy. 
Exploratory objectives: 
The objective was to collect DNA, RNA, and other biomarkers for future use for the purpose of discovery of 
predictive biomarkers. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary endpoints: 
• ACR20 response at Week 24 
•  Change  in  physical  function  as  measured  by  the  change  from  baseline  in  the  Health  Assessment 
Question-Disability (HAQ-DI) at Week 16 
• Change in van der Heijde modified total Sharp score at Week 52 
Main secondary endpoint: Major clinical response defined as the event of achieving and maintaining an ACR 70 
response for at least 24 consecutive weeks during the 52week treatment period. 
Other secondary endpoints: ACR 20 at Weeks 36 and 52; ACR50 and ACR70 responses at Weeks 24, 36, and 52; 
ACR20/50/70 at each visit; change from baseline in each of the 7 ACR components at each visit, ACRn at each 
visit, standardized AUC for change from baseline in HAQ-DI up to Week 52; HAQ-DI response over 52 weeks; 
change from baseline in disease activity score 28 C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) at each visit; DAS28-CRP 
remission at Weeks 24 and 52; European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response at Weeks 24 and 52; 
clinical  disease  activity  index  (CDAI)  remission  at  Weeks  24  and  52;  SDAI  remission  at  Weeks  24  and  52; 
change from baseline in CDAI and SDAI at Weeks 24 and 52; Boolean-based ACR/EULAR remission at Weeks 24 
and 52; change from baseline in erosion score and joint space narrowing (JSN) score at Week 52; change from 
baseline  in  modified  total  Sharp  score  (mTSS),  ES,  and  JSN  at  Week  24;  radiographic  progression  of  the 
mTSS/erosion score/JSN at Week 52. 
• Quality of life and health economics observations: short form-36 survey (SF-36) at Weeks 24 and 52, 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue scale (FACIT-Fatigue) at Weeks 24 and 52, Sleep 
visual analog scale (VAS) at Weeks 24 and 52, and work productivity activity impairment (WPAI) at Weeks 12 
and 52 
Sample size 
Sample size calculation was based on the change in mTSS.  A 2-sided Wilcoxon test for alpha = 0.025 (to 
address the multiplicity across the 2 active dose regimens), 90% power, a week 52 mean change of 1.10 and 
0.35 in the placebo and active groups, a standard deviation (SD) of 2.6 (Lithe study) and a missing data rate of 
15% resulted in a requirement of 372 patients per group.   
It was calculated that with 372 subjects per group the power for testing week ACR20 (anticipating ARC20 
response rates of 27% for placebo and 51% for each of the active treatment groups) and change in HAQ-DI at 
week 16 (anticipating 0.3 week 16 treatment difference and common SD of 0.79) would exceed 90%.  
Randomisation 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 48/189 
  
  
Patients in part B of the study were initially randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1:1 (5 dose regimens of sarilumab: 
placebo) (cohort 1). Following dose selection in part A of the study subjects were randomized at a randomization 
ratio of 1:1:1 (placebo: sarilumab 150 mg q2w: sarilumab 200 mg q2w) (cohort 2). Randomisation was done via 
an IVR system. Randomization was stratified for to prior biologic use and region. Permuted block randomisation 
(block length: 6) was applied 
Blinding (masking) 
Double-blind.  
Statistical methods 
In general data were summarized by statistical characteristics (continuous data: n, mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum; qualitative data: absolute and relative frequencies) stratified by treatment and visit 
(if applicable).   
The primary efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population of all patients randomised in part B of the trial 
after the dose selection based on part A was done (cohort 2).  
The study had 3 co-primary endpoints: ACR20 response at week 24, change from baseline in HAQ-DI at week 16 
and change from baseline in the van der Heijde mTSS at week 52.  
ACR20 response rate at week 24 was analysed by means of a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by 
prior biologic use and region. For the primary analysis patients with missing ACR20 at week 24 for any reason 
including patients who dropped out or required rescue medication were considered non-responders.  In a 
sensitivity analysis responder status following treatment discontinuation or rescue was determined using LOCF 
to impute missing data (patients with still insufficient information were considered non-responders). 
Change from baseline in HAQ-DI at week 16, was analysed by means of a MMRM approach assuming an 
unstructured covariance structure to model the within-subject errors. The model included treatment, region, 
prior biologic use, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.  For the 
primary analysis data collected after treatment discontinuation or rescue were set to missing. For a sensitivity 
analysis an LOCF approach was used to impute missing HAQ-DI values beyond the time of treatment 
discontinuation or initiation of rescue medication (rescue allowed from week 16 onwards).  A supportive analysis 
compared the proportion of HAQ-DI responder at week 16 for each active group vs. placebo using the same 
approach as for ACR20 applying non-responder imputation for missing data. Additionally the standardized AUC 
for change from baseline in HAQ-DI up to week 52 was compared between each active treatment group and 
placebo by means of an ANCOVA model with baseline as covariate and factors for treatment, region and prior 
biologic use.  
Change from baseline in the van der Heijde mTSS at week 52, was analysed by fitting a 2-sided rank-based 
analysis of covariance (rank ANCOVA) model adjusted for baseline with factors for treatment, prior biologic use 
and region. This was done separately for each dose versus placebo. Standardized ranks were computed by prior 
biologic use and region for the covariate baseline and the response change in van der Heijde mTSS. For the 
primary analysis missing or post-rescue week 52 mTSS score was imputed by means of linear extrapolation. To 
assess the robustness of the analysis several sensitivity analyses for imputing missing data were pre-planned 
(mean rank imputation, LOCF, linear extrapolation including post treatment discontinuation and rescue data, 
observed cases). 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 49/189 
  
  
Subgroup analyses for each of the co-primary efficacy endpoints were conducted with respect to the following 
subgroups in the ITT population: gender, Race, Region, Age, baseline weight, BMI, prior biologic use, 
rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP antibody, baseline CRP, duration of RA, number of prior DMARDs, smoking history. 
Binary secondary variables, including the key secondary efficacy endpoint, major clinical response during 52 
weeks (with non-responder imputation for missing endpoint data), were analysed in the same way as ACR20.  
Change from baseline for continuous secondary efficacy variables was analysed via a MMRM approach.  
For each sarilumab group treatment effects (vs. placebo) were described by point estimates from the respective 
analysis model including the corresponding 95%-CIs. 
To control the type I error for the 3 co-primary endpoints and the 1 key secondary endpoint across part B for 
each dose (at alpha = 0.025) separately a hierarchical testing procedure was defined: 
1.  ACR20 response at week 24 
2.  Change from baseline in HAQ-DI at week 16 
3.  Change from baseline in mTSS at week 52 
4.  Incidence of achieving major clinical response during the 52-week period. 
The study was considered positive if ACR20 response achieved statistical significance at least 1 dose. 
For other secondary endpoints each selected dose regimen of sarilumab was tested versus placebo at the 0.025 
level according to a hierarchical testing order pre-specified in the SAP. 
For the co-primary efficacy parameter the same analyses as mentioned above were performed on the ITT 
population of all randomized patients in part B (i.e. patients randomized to either sarilumab 150 mg q2w, 
sarilumab 200 mg q2w or placebo prior and after dose selection in part A). For this population no sensitivity or 
subgroup analyses were performed.

Outcomes and estimation 
ACR20 
The proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response at Week 24 was higher in patients treated with 
sarilumab (58.0% for the 150 mg q2w and 66.4% for the 200 mg q2w groups) than in patients treated with 
placebo (33.4%), with p-values <0.0001 demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in signs and 
symptoms of RA in favor of both sarilumab doses compared with placebo.

Similar results were obtained in the primary analysis of Cohort 2 and Cohort 1 selected doses. 
The ACR20 response rate increased at each visit from Week 2 through Week 16 for all treatment groups. The 
response rate was maintained up to Week 52, with a slight decrease in response rates due to patients 
discontinuing study treatment and being assigned as non-responders (Figure 2).

HAQ-DI 
The mean change from baseline in the HAQ-DI score at Week 16 was greater in patients treated with sarilumab 
(-0.54 for the150 mg q2w and -0.58 for the 200 mg q2w groups) than in patients treated with placebo (-0.30). 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017

The results demonstrated a statistically significant difference (p-values <0.0001) in improvement of physical 
function in favor of both sarilumab doses compared with placebo. 
Similar results were obtained in the primary analysis of Cohort 2 and Cohort 1 selected doses. 
Supportive analyses 
For the analysis of clinically meaningful HAQ-DI response, 2 different definitions were used: >0.3 and >0.22 
units of improvement in the change from baseline. For both definitions, the proportion of patients who were 
HAQ-DI responders at Week 16 was higher in the sarilumab 150 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w treatment groups 
than in the placebo group: 
• HAQ-DI response >0.3 units of improvement: 42.5% for placebo, 53.8% for 150 mg q2w and 57.4% for 200 
mg q2w 
• HAQ-DI response >0.22 units of improvement: 51.3% for placebo, 63.3% for 150 mg q2w and 64.9% for 200 
mg q2w 
The proportion of patients who were HAQ-DI responders at Weeks 24 and 52 was higher in the sarilumab 150 
mg q2w and 200 mg q2w treatment groups than in the placebo group: 
• HAQ-DI response >0.3 units of improvement: 33.4% for placebo, 51.0% for 150 mg q2w and 51.4% for 200 
mg q2w at Week 24; 26.1% for placebo, 47.0% for 150 mg q2w and 47.6% for 200 mg q2w at Week 52; 
• HAQ-DI response >0.22 units of improvement: 39.2% for placebo, 57.5% for 150 mg q2w and 57.9% for 200 
mg q2w at Week 24; 32.9% for placebo, 53.3% for 150 mg q2w and 53.1% for 200 mg q2w at Week 52. 
For both definitions of clinically meaningful HAQ-DI response, sarilumab doses had nominal p-values <0.0001 at 
Weeks 16, 24, and 52, indicating a clinically meaningful effect on improvement of physical function. 
HAQ-DI response over 52 weeks is defined as the standardized AUC for change from baseline in HAQ-DI up to 
Week 52 with >0.22 or >0.3 units of improvement. For both definitions, the proportion of patients who were 
HAQ-DI responders was higher in the sarilumab 150 mg q2w and sarilumab 200 mg q2w groups than in the 
placebo group (nominal p-values <0.0001 for both comparisons): 
• HAQ-DI response >0.3 units of improvement: 43.7% for placebo, 59.0% for sarilumab 150 mg q2w and 
59.9% for sarilumab 200 mg q2w 
• HAQ-DI response >0.22 units of improvement: 49.7 % for placebo, 65% for sarilumab 150 mg q2w and 67.7% 
for sarilumab 200 mg q2w 
The effect was maintained up to Week 52. 
Standardized AUC for the change from baseline in HAQ-DI up to Week 52 
The change in LS mean in the standardized AUC for change from baseline in HAQ-DI score up to Week 52 was 
numerically greater in patients treated with sarilumab (-0.48 for the 150 mg q2w and -0.50 for the 200 mg q2w 
groups) than in patients treated with placebo (-0.26). The difference in LS means between each of the sarilumab 
groups and the placebo group was statistically significant (p-value <0.0001) 
HAQ-DI response at each visit 
Improvement in physical function was maintained up to Week 52 (Figure 4). The improvement in physical 
function was greater for both sarilumab groups compared with the placebo group (nominal p-values <0.0001) 
at Weeks 24 and 52.

for the150 mg q2w and 0.25 for the 200 mg q2w groups) than in patients treated with placebo (2.78), indicating 
inhibition of progression of structural damage by sarilumab. 
Differences compared with placebo were statistically significant (p-value <0.0001) in favor of both sarilumab 
doses. 
Similar results were obtained in the primary analysis of Cohort 2 and Cohort 1 selected doses. 
Supportive analyses 
At Week 52, treatment with sarilumab was associated with significantly less radiographic progression of 
structural damage as compared with placebo (Table 20).

Page 70/189 
  
  
The incidence of patients with any positive ADA assay result during the TEAE period (ie, having at least 1 sample 
positive in the ADA assay during the study) was 5.9% in placebo, 22.6% in 150 mg q2w, and 16.0% in 200 mg 
q2w. 
The incidence of positive ADA assay results during the treatment period (ie, ADA negative at baseline and 
became ADA positive on treatment or ADA positive at baseline with at least a 4-fold increase in ADA titer on 
treatment) was 4.2% in the placebo group, 19.8% in the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group, and 14.6% in the 
sarilumab 200 mg q2w group. 
The incidence of neutralizing antibodies was 0.2% in the placebo group, 3.5% in the sarilumab 150 mg q2w 
group, and 2.4% in the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group. 
A persistent positive ADA assay result (ie, at least 2 consecutive post-baseline samples were positive or the last 
post-baseline sample collected was positive) was observed in 2.3% of patients in the placebo group, 7.9% of 
patients in the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group, and 6.1% of patients in the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group. A 
transient result (ie, any treatment-emergent positive ADA assay result that was not considered persistent) was 
observed in 1.9% of placebo patients, 11.9% of patients in the sarilumab 150mg q2w group, and 8.5% of 
patients in the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group. 
Patients were grouped by ADA status (positive or negative), regardless of sarilumab treatment group, for 
assessment of lack or loss of efficacy and treatment-emergent hypersensitivity. Lack of efficacy was defined as 
permanent discontinuation of IMP due to lack of efficacy or switching to open-label rescue treatment. Loss of 
efficacy was defined as permanent discontinuation of IMP or switching to open-label rescue treatment after 
achieving an ACR50 or good EULAR response. 
The incidence of lack of efficacy was 14.8% and 16.3% and loss of efficacy was 3.8% and 6.8% in ADA negative 
and ADA positive patients, respectively. The incidence of hypersensitivity, both local and systemic reactions, 
was 7.5% in ADA negative patients and 6.1% in ADA positive patients. The incidences in the placebo group were 
40.7% for lack of efficacy, 4.0% for loss of efficacy, and 4.7% for hypersensitivity.

Route(s) of administration: subcutaneous (SC) in the abdomen, or thigh, or upper arm. 
All patients continued to receive regular treatment with one or a combination of the non-biologic DMARDs, MTX, 
SSZ, LEF, and HCQ which should have been started at least 12 weeks prior to baseline and patients should have 
been on a stable dose(s) for at least 6 weeks prior to screening and during the study treatment period.However, 
at any time, the DMARD dose could be reduced for a safety or tolerability reason, and the dose was not to be 
increased any time during the study. 
Non-investigational medicinal products (eg, DMARDs) were dispensed according to the local practice. All 
patients taking MTX received folic/folinic acid according to local recommendation in the country where the study 
was conducted. 
Background medication as monotherapy or in combination, oral or parenteral, included: 
• Methotrexate (MTX) – 10 to 25 mg/wk (or per local labeling requirements if the dose range differs) 
• Folic/folinic acid per country guidelines 
• Leflunomide (LEF) – 10 to 20 mg daily 
• Sulfasalazine (SSZ) – 1000 to 3000 mg daily 
• Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) - 200 to 400 mg daily 
Objectives 
Primary objectives 
To demonstrate that sarilumab added to non-biologic DMARDs is effective in reducing the signs and symptoms 
at Week 24 and improving physical function at Week 12 in patients with active RA who are inadequate 
responders to or intolerant of TNF-α antagonists. 
Secondary objectives 
To demonstrate that sarilumab added to non-biologic DMARD therapy in patients with active RA who are 
inadequate responders or intolerant to TNF-α antagonists, is effective in the: 
• reduction of signs and symptoms at Week 12 
• improvement in physical function at Week 24 
• improvement of disease activity score at Weeks 12 and 24, and 
• improvement of quality of life as measured by patient reported outcomes (PROs) at intermediate visits and at 
Week 24 
To assess the exposure to sarilumab added to non-biologic DMARD therapy in this population. 
To assess the safety of sarilumab in this population. 
Exploratory objectives 
To collect DNA, RNA, and other biomarkers for future use for the purpose of discovery of predictive biomarker. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints in the study were the ACR20 response rate at Week 24 and the change from baseline 
in HAQ-DI at Week 12. 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 73/189 
  
  
Secondary efficacy variables 
• ACR20/50/70 at Week 12 and ACR50/70 at Week 24 
• ACR-N at Week 12 and Week 24 
• Change from baseline in the ACR components at Weeks 12 and 24 
• Disease activity score (DAS28)/EULAR Response at Week 12 and Week 24 
• DAS28 -CRP <2.6 (“remission”) at Week 12 and Week 24 
• EULAR Response at Week 12 and Week 24 
• ACR/EULAR Remission (Boolean-based) at Week 12 and Week 24 
• Simplified disease activity index/clinical disease activity index 
Patient reported outcomes (PRO) were also recorded (Short-Form-36, EQ-5D-3L, functional assessment of 
chronic illness therapy fatigue scale, morning stiffness visual analogue scale, rheumatoid arthritis-work 
productivity survey, and rheumatoid arthritis impact of disease). 
Sample size 
From the tocilizumab program changes of -0.05 and -0.35 in the placebo and sarilumab groups, respectively as 
well as a common standard deviation (SD) of 0.79 were anticipated for the initial primary endpoint change from 
baseline in HAQ-DI at week 24. Applying a 2 group t-test, alpha = 0.025 (2-sided, to account for comparing 2 
active groups to placebo) 174 patients per treatment group (i.e. 522 patients in total) were to be randomized in 
order to achieve 90% power.  
With amendment 3 the timing of the HAQ primary endpoint was changed from 24 weeks to 12 weeks. Under the 
following assumptions for HAQ-DI at week 12 (as seen in study EFC11072 part B) SD = 0.52 and treatment 
difference to placebo equals 0.2 (low dose) and 0.28 (high dose) respectively, with 174 subjects per group, the 
power for HAQ-DI at week 12 was calculated to 90% for the low dose group and >90% for the high dose group. 
With 174 patients per group, ACR20 week 24 response rates of 20% (placebo) and 50% (active treatment) 
respectively and a type I error of 0.025 (2-sided), a χ2 test comparing each active treatment to placebo has 
about 99% power. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1 (sarilumab 150 mg q2w: sarilumab 200 mg q2w: placebo q2w). 
Randomization was stratified by region and number of previous anti-TNFs (1 versus >1). Permuted block 
randomisation (block length: 6) was applied.  
Blinding (masking) 
Double blind. 
Statistical methods 
In general data were summarized by statistical characteristics (continuous data: n, mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum; qualitative data: absolute and relative frequencies) stratified by treatment and visit 
(if applicable).

EMA/292840/2017 
Page 74/189 
  
  
The primary efficacy analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisting of all randomized 
patients. 
ACR20 response rate at week 24 was analyzed by means of a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by 
number of previous anti-TNFs (1 versus >1) and region. Each dose group of sarilumab was compared to placebo 
separately.  In the primary analysis patients with missing ACR20 at week 24 information for any reason 
including patients who dropped out or required rescue medication (rescue medication permitted from week 12 
on) were considered non-responders.  In a sensitivity analysis responder status following treatment 
discontinuation or rescue was determined using LOCF to impute missing data (patients with insufficient 
information were considered non-responders). 
Change from baseline in HAQ-DI at week 12, was analyzed using a MMRM approach assuming an unstructured 
covariance structure to model the within-subject errors. The model included treatment, region, number of 
previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate. The 
difference between each active treatment group versus placebo in the change from baseline in HAQ-DI at week 
12 was tested. For the primary analysis data collected after treatment discontinuation or rescue were set to 
missing. Two sensitivity analyses were performed. The first sensitivity analysis applied an LOCF procedure to 
impute missing HAQ-DI values beyond the time of treatment discontinuation or initiation of rescue medication. 
The second sensitivity analysis of the HAQ-DI at Week 12 used multiple imputations for handling missing data.   
Subgroup analyses were conducted for ACR20 as well as change from baseline in HAQ-DI with respect to 
subgroups defined by gender, race, region, age, baseline weight, BMI, number of previous anti-TNF-α, 
rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP antibody, baseline CRP, duration of RA, number of prior DMARDs, background 
DMARDs use, and smoking history. For each subgroup and each active dose group the MH estimate of the odds 
ratio vs. placebo and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated. 
Treatment effects were described by point estimates and the corresponding 95%-CI derived from the analyses 
models mentioned above. 
Binary secondary efficacy variables were analyzed using the same approach as for ACR20 at week 24.  
Continuous secondary endpoints were analysed using the same method used to analyse HAQ-DI. 
The study was declared successful if any dose regimen achieved statistical significance in ACR20. A hierarchical 
testing procedure was used for the multiple endpoints at α=0.025 for each dose regimen separately. The 
hierarchy was: 
• 
Incidence of ACR20 response at Week 24 
•  Change from baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 12. 
For secondary efficacy endpoints, each selected dose regimen was tested versus placebo at the 0.025 level in a 
pre-specified hierarchical order. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 1224 patients that were screened, 678 patients were screen failures (55.4%) and 1 patient was not 
randomized but treated (this patient was treated mistakenly with one dose of sarilumab 200 mg by the study 
staff during the screening period and no associated adverse event was reported). 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 75/189 
  
  
Screen failures were mainly due to failure to meet the inclusion criterion for the severity of the disease (53%) or 
not having high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) above or equal to 8 mg/L, or were excluded due to 
tuberculosis (21%). 
A total of 546 patients were randomized and treated. These patients represent the ITT/efficacy population and 
the safety population.

Table 27 provides details of overall patient disposition, with details of all patients who withdrew from the study 
after enrollment, together with the specific reasons for discontinuation, and the duration of treatment before 
discontinuation. All “other” reasons for withdrawals were reviewed and were mostly due to withdrawal of

Table 32: Change from baseline in HAQ-DI at week 12 – ITT population 
Proportion of HAQ-DI responder 
For the analysis of clinically meaningful HAQ-DI response, 2 different definitions were used: 
≥ 0.3 and ≥ 0.22 units of improvement in the change from baseline. At Week 12, there was no difference 
between the 2 sarilumab dose groups and placebo for the definition using an improvement of ≥ 0.22 units, which 
may be explained by the regional differences. 
Using an improvement of ≥ 0.3 units as the definition, however both sarilumab doses were numerically higher 
compared to placebo (51.1% for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group, 47.0% for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group 
and 35.9% for the placebo group). The nominal p-values were 0.0025 and 0.0297, respectively. 
At Week 24, and for an improvement of ≥ 0.22 units, the proportion of patients who were HAQ-D responders 
was higher in both of the sarilumab treated groups (150 mg q2w group [47.5%] and 200 mg q2w group 
[56.0%]) than in the placebo group (35.4%) (nominal p-values=0.0137 for 150 mg q2w and p<0.0001 for 200 
mg q2w group). 
At Week 24, and for an improvement of ≥ 0.3 units, the proportion of patients who were HAQ-DI responders was 
higher in both of the sarilumab treated groups (150 mg q2w group [43.1%] and 200 mg q2w group [47.3%]) 
than in the placebo group (31.5%) (nominal p-values=0.0165 for 150 mg q2w and p=0.0014 for 200 mg q2w 
group). 
Secondary analyses of ACR20 and HAQ-DI 
Sensitivity analysis 
Sensitivity analysis of the incidence of ACR20 response at Week 24 used the LOCF method for handling missing 
data are presented in table 37. These results were similar to those of the primary analysis and the proportion of 
patients achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 24 was significantly higher in patients treated with sarilumab 
than in patients treated with placebo.

Response over time  
The ACR20 response rate increased at each visit from Week 2 through Week 12 for the sarilumab treatment 
groups. The response rate was maintained up to Week 24. The placebo effect increased for the first 8 weeks and 
reached a plateau until Week 24.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Each selected dose regimen was tested versus placebo at 0.025 level (simple Bonferroni adjustment) on the 
hierarchical order for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints shown in Table 38. The results that are in 
bold font are statistically significant according to the procedure of analysis. The last statistically significant 
endpoint in the testing hierarchy was the PCS of SF-36 at Week 24 for both sarilumab dose groups. Significance 
is not claimed for those parameters lower in the testing hierarchy; ie, for the MCS of SF-36, FACIT-Fatigue, 
Morning Stiffness, WPS-RA, RAID, and EQ-5D-3L. 
Week 24 is presented prior to Week 12 for these endpoints as it was the week included in the hierarchy.

Clinical disease activity index 
Baseline CDAI values were similar across the treatment groups, ranging from 41.59 to 44.10. At Week 24, the 
mean change from baseline was -27.14 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and -30.43 for the sarilumab 200 
mg q2w group compared to -23.90 for the placebo group (p <0.0001 for both treatment groups compared to 
placebo). Results at Week 12 were consistent with Week 24 (nominal p <0.0001 for both treatment groups 
compared to placebo). The proportion of patients achieving CDAI remission (ie, CDAI ≤ 2.8) was numerically 
higher in the sarilumab groups (9.4% for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group [nominal p-value=0.0971] and 8.2% 
for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group [nominal p-value=0.2134]) at Week 24 and (3.3% for the sarilumab 150 
mg q2w group [nominal p-value=0.0551] and 4.9% for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group[nominal 
p-value=0.0106]) at Week 12. 
Simplified disease activity index 
Baseline SDAI values were similar across the treatment groups, ranging from 44.89 to 47.20. All treatment 
groups showed a decrease from baseline in the SDAI. 
At Week 24, the mean change from baseline was -28.45 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and –33.36 for the 
sarilumab 200 mg q2w group compared to -24.48 for the placebo group (nominal p-values <0.0001 for both 
treatment groups compared to placebo). 
The results at Week 12, were consistent with the results at Week 24 (nominal p-value <0.0001 for both 
treatment groups compared to placebo). The proportion of patients achieving SDAI remission (ie, SDAI ≤ 3.3) 
was higher in patients in the sarilumab groups (9.9% for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and 8.7% for the 
sarilumab 200 mg q2w group) at Week 24 when compared with placebo (2.8%). The nominal p-values at Week 
24 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group were 0.0044 and 0.0146, 
respectively. The results at Week 12 were consistent with the results at Week 24 (nominal p-value=0.0007 and 
0.0014 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group, respectively).

EULAR Response at Week 12 and Week 24 
A larger proportion of patients in the sarilumab treatment groups achieved a good or moderate EULAR response 
compared to the placebo group at Week 24 (44.2% for placebo, 62.4% for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and 
71.7% for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group). The nominal p-value for testing the difference in the EULAR 
response between each of the sarilumab groups and the placebo group was p=0.0004 and p <0.0001 at Week 
24 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group, respectively. The results at Week 
12 were consistent with the results at Week 24. 
Boolean-based (ACR/EULAR Remission) at Week 12 and Week 24 
The proportion of patients achieving Boolean-based ACR/EULAR remission at Weeks 12 (3.3% for the sarilumab 
150 mg q2w group and 2.7% for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group) and at Week 24 (5.5% for the sarilumab 150 
mg q2w group and 6.0% for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group) was numerically higher in patients treated with 
sarilumab than in patients treated with placebo (0 at Week 12 and 2.8% at Week 24). At Week 24, nominal 
p-values for testing the difference in increase in Boolean-based ACR/EULAR response between each of the 
sarilumab groups and the placebo group were p >0.025. At Week 12, nominal p-values for testing the difference 
in increase in Boolean-based ACR/EULAR response between each of the sarilumab groups and the placebo group 
were 0.0129 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and 0.0252 for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group. 
Quality of life and health economics observations 
SF-36 at Weeks 12 and 24 
The PCS and MCS scores evaluated at Weeks 24 were part of the hierarchical testing procedure. The 8 health 
domain scores were tested but were not part of the hierarchical testing procedure. 
The SF-36 can be scored on a 0-100 scale or as a norm-based t-score. 
Scores were considered clinically meaningful if the within group change from baseline met or exceeded values 
for the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). The MCID was a change of 2.5 points for PCS and MCS, 
and a change of 5 points for the 8 health domains (29). 
Change from baseline in SF-36 at Weeks 12 and 24 – Physical component summary and Physical Health 
Domains 
The differences in SF-36 PCS scores at Weeks 12 and 24 were statistically significant for both sarilumab 
treatment groups compared with placebo (Week 12: p<0.0001 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and 
p<0.0001 for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group; Week 24: p<0.0004 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and 
p<0.0001 for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group) ( ~xr124i and ~xr125i ). The within-group mean changes from 
baseline for both active treatment groups exceeded MCID. 
At Week 12 and 24, both sarilumab treatment groups had clinically meaningful changes from baseline in all 4 
SF-36 physical health domains and these changes were significantly different from placebo (p<0.05) with the 
exception of the General Health domain for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group. 
Change from baseline in SF-36 at Weeks 12 and 24 – Mental component summary and Mental Health Domains 
The differences in SF-36 MCS scores at Week 12 were statistically significant for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w 
group compared with placebo (p=0.0028). The difference in SF-36 MCS scores at Week 12 was not statistically 
significant for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group compared with placebo (p=0.1005).

At Week 12, the sarilumab 200 mg group had clinically meaningful changes from baseline on all 4 SF-36 mental 
health domains (nominal p-values of p=0.0007 for Vitality, p=0.0018 for Social Functioning, p=0.0338 for Role 
Emotional, and p=0.0001 for Mental Health). The sarilumab 150 mg q2w group had clinically meaningful 
changes in all 4 domains; however, these changes were only different from placebo for Vitality (p=0.0163) and 
Social Functioning (p=0.0004). 
The differences in SF-36 MCS scores at Week 24 for both sarilumab treatment groups compared with placebo did 
not reach statistical significance (p=0.2026 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and p=0.0854 for the 
sarilumab 200 mg q2w group). 
At Week 24, both sarilumab treatment groups had clinically meaningful changes from baseline on all 4 SF-36 
mental health domains; however, these changes were only different from placebo for the Vitality domain 
(nominal p-values of p=0.0167 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and p=0.0008 for the sarilumab 200 mg 
q2w group) and the Social Functioning domain (nominal p values of p=0.0203 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w 
group and p=0.0138 for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group). Changes were also different from placebo in the 
Mental Health domain for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group. 
FACIT-Fatigue at Week 24 
The FACIT-Fatigue scores evaluated at Weeks 24 were part of the hierarchical testing procedure. Statistical 
significance of this endpoint is not claimed since the testing hierarchy was broken prior to this parameter. Scores 
were considered to be clinically meaningful if the within group mean change from baseline met or exceeded the 
minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 4.0. 
Clinically meaningful changes from baseline in FACIT-Fatigue scores were reported at Week 24 for both 
sarilumab treatment groups compared to placebo (nominal p-values of p=0.0078 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w 
group and p=0.0040 for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group). 
Morning Stiffness VAS at Week 24 
Statistical significance of this endpoint is not claimed since the testing hierarchy was broken prior to this 
parameter. Scores were considered to be clinically meaningful if the within-group mean change from baseline 
met or exceeded the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 10.0. 
Clinically meaningful changes from baseline in morning stiffness VAS scores were reported at Week 24 for both 
sarilumab treatment groups compared to placebo (nominal p-values of p=0.0008 for the sarilumab 150 mg q2w 
group and p=0.0001 for the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group).  
WPS-RA at Week 24. 
Statistical significance of this endpoint is not claimed since the testing hierarchy was broken prior to this

Table 51: Summary of ADA assay response - Immunogenicity population 
There were 7 patients (5 in the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and 2 in the sarilumab 200 mg q2w group) who had 
neutralizing antibodies. One patient (010832-840-106-407) had discontinued due to lack of efficacy with the 
last dose on Day 72. He had neutralizing antibodies on Day 30 and Day 86 with ADA titer on Day 30 of 120 and 
on Day 86 of 240. No subsequent ADA sampling was done. This patient’s sarilumab concentrations were all 
below the LLOQ (312.5 ng/mL) from pre-dose to Day 86, ie, the sarilumab concentration were not detectable 
before and after he had neutralizing antibodies. None of the patients with neutralizing antibodies experienced a 
hypersensitivity reaction. 
Two patients who were ADA positive had an AE identified by the hypersensitivity SMQ. Both patients had 
systemic hypersensitivity reactions. Neither patient had neutralizing antibodies. Patient 010832-724-001-401 
had a generalized rash. The other patient (010832-840-055-412) had a rash on the inner thighs that began on 
Day 121; it was treated with topical antifungal and resolved on Day 149. The patient had an isolated ADA sample 
that was positive with a titer of 30 on Day 31. The patient completed study and enrolled into LTS11210. 
No ADA positive patient had evidence of loss of efficacy (ie, defined as permanent treatment discontinuation due 
to lack of efficacy after achieving an ACR50 or EULAR Good response).

One injection of sarilumab 200 mg or matching placebo (for patients in the adalimumab group) was 
administered q2w during the 24-week randomized period (an IMP administration window of ± 3 days). In the 
open label period, the sarilumab dose may have been reduced to 150 mg q2w in case of pre-defined levels of 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or an increase in liver enzymes (ALT) or alternately resumed at the prior dose 
of 200 mg q2w based on investigator judgment, provided other conditions for resumption of the IMP were met. 
Adalimumab 
One injection of adalimumab 40 mg or matching placebo (for patients in the sarilumab group) was administered 
q2w (an IMP administration window of ± 3 days was permitted).  
For patients who required dose escalation to weekly adalimumab 40 mg (or matching placebo) dosing in the 
randomized treatment period, the IMP was to be administered every 7 days; in this case, an IMP administration 
window of ±1 day was permitted per protocol to accommodate exceptional circumstances. 
Prior and concomitant therapy 
Prior medications were those the patient used prior to first IMP intake (Day-28 to Day-1). Prior medications 
could be discontinued before first dosing or could be ongoing during the treatment phase. All medications taken 
within a certain period of time before randomization and until the end of the study, including vaccines taken 
within 10 years before screening, DMARDs and immunosuppressive agents taken since diagnosis of RA 
(especially MTX, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, etc.) were reported.  
A concomitant medication was any treatment received by the patient concomitantly to any IMP(s).  
Objectives 
Primary Objectives 
To demonstrate that sarilumab monotherapy is superior to adalimumab monotherapy with respect to signs and 
symptoms as assessed by disease activity score 28 based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) at 
Week 24 in patients with active RA who are either intolerant of, or considered inappropriate candidates for 
continued treatment with MTX, or after at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment with MTX, are determined to 
be inadequate responders. 
Secondary Objectives 
To demonstrate that sarilumab monotherapy is superior to adalimumab monotherapy in patients with active RA 
who are either intolerant of or considered inappropriate candidates for continued treatment with MTX, or after 
at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment with MTX, are determined to be inadequate responders, with respect 
to: 
• Reduction of signs and symptoms of RA at Week 24 (DAS28-ESR remission, American College of 
Rheumatology [ACR] 20/50/70 response, etc) 
• Improvement in quality of life assessed by patient reported outcome questionnaires at Week 24 Assessment 
of the safety and tolerability of sarilumab monotherapy (including immunogenicity) throughout the study. 
Exploratory Objectives 
In patients with active RA who are either intolerant of, or considered inappropriate candidates for continued 
treatment with MTX, or after at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment with MTX, are determined to be 
inadequate responders: 
Assessment report

• To describe maintenance of response over time of sarilumab monotherapy 
• To describe pharmacokinetics of sarilumab monotherapy 
To collect DNA, RNA, and other biomarkers for future use for the purpose of discovery of predictive biomarkers. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy variable: 
DAS28-ESR score change from baseline at Week 24 
The DAS28-ESR score was assessed with a composite score that included 4 variables: 
• Tender Joints Count (TJC) (based on 28 joints) 
• Swollen Joints Count (SJC) (based on 28 joints) 
• General health assessment by the patient assessed from the ACR RA core set questionnaire (patient global 
assessment) in 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) 
• Marker of inflammation assessed by the ESR in mm/hr. 
It was a continuous measure allowing for measurement of absolute change in disease activity and percentage 
improvement. 
Secondary efficacy variables:  
DAS28-ESR remission (<2.6) at Week 24, low disease activity (DAS28-ESR <3.2) at Week 24, change from 
baseline in disease activity score for 28 Joints based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) at Week 24, 
DAS28-CRP remission (<2.6) at Week 24, ACR20/50/70 response (including Health Assessment 
Question-Disability Index [HAQ-DI]) at Week 24, change from baseline in each individual ACR component at 
Week 24, remission based on clinical disease activity index (CDAI) (≤2.8) at Week 24 and change from baseline 
in CDAI at Week 24. 
Patient-reported outcomes: Short-Form 36 (SF-36), EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L), Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of 
Disease (RAID), RAspecific Work Productivity Survey (WPS-RA), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness 
Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACITFatigue), and morning stiffness VAS at Week 24. 
Sample size 
A difference of 0.6 in DAS28-ESR between 2 active treatments was considered to be clinically relevant. From 
prior trial data (ADACTA) the SD of the change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at week 24 was expected to be 1.7. 
In order for a 2-sample t-test to have 90% power to detect a 0.6 difference at the 5% significance level (2-sided 
test), 170 patients per group were required. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized at a ratio of 1:1 (sarilumab 200 mg q2w: adalimumab 40 mg q2w). Randomization 
was stratified by region. Permuted block randomisation (block length: 4) was applied. 
Blinding (masking) 
Double-dummy blinding. 
Statistical methods 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 102/189 
  
  
In general data were summarized by statistical characteristics (continuous data: n, mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum; qualitative data: absolute and relative frequencies) stratified by treatment and visit 
(if applicable).  
The primary efficacy analysis population was the ITT population of all randomized patients.  
The primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in DAS28-ESR was analysed with a MMRM approach 
assuming an unstructured covariance structure to model the within-subject errors. The model, including terms 
for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction and region as fixed effects and baseline DAS28-ESR as a 
continuous covariate, was used to assess the difference between treatment groups in the change from baseline 
in DAS28-ESR at week 24. Data collected after permanent treatment discontinuation was excluded from the 
primary analysis.   
Two sensitivity analyses of DAS28-ESR at Week 24 were performed:  
• 
• 
including assessments made after permanent treatment discontinuation,  
using multiple imputation for all data after treatment discontinuation or adalimumab (or matching 
placebo) dose increase.  
Subgroup analyses were pre-specified for the primary endpoint with respect to subgroups defined by gender, 
race, region, age, baseline weight, BMI, RF, anti-CCP antibody, baseline CRP, baseline ESR, duration of RA, 
number of prior DMARDs, MTX history, and smoking history.   
The same approach as for the primary endpoint was used to analyse continuous secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Binary secondary efficacy variables were analysed using a 2-sided CMH test stratified by region. In these 
analyses, patients who discontinued treatment prior to week 24 were considered as non-responders.  
Treatment effects were described by point estimates and the corresponding 95%-CI derived from the analyses 
models mentioned above. 
To control the type I error, if the primary endpoint was declared significant, a hierarchical testing procedure was 
pre-specified for the analysis of the secondary endpoints. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 540 patients that were screened, 171 patients were screen failures (31.7%) and 369 were randomized. 
Screen failures were mainly due to meeting the exclusion criteria related to tuberculosis (12.0%), and due to 
failure to meet the inclusion criterion for the severity of the disease (8.1%). 
The ITT population consisted of the 369 randomized patients. For the primary safety analysis the safety 
population consisted of 368 patients. One patient was randomized but not treated in the adalimumab group 
because she did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and the randomization was done in error.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary analysis 
The change from baseline in the DAS28-ESR score at Week 24 showed a significantly greater improvement in 
the sarilumab group compared to adalimumab group. A greater difference was also observed at Week 12 when 
the first post-baseline assessment was done (nominal p<0.0001). The primary analysis included data regardless 
of dose escalation. 
Table 57: Change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at Week 24 - ITT population 
Sensitivity analyses 
Two sensitivity analyses of the change from baseline in the DAS28-ESR score at Week 24 were performed. 
In the first sensitivity analysis, all data including assessments made after permanent treatment discontinuation 
were included. Consistent with the primary analysis, a statistically significant difference in favor of sarilumab 
compared to adalimumab was observed. 
In the second sensitivity analysis, all data after treatment discontinuation or adalimumab (or matching placebo) 
dose increase were set to missing and a multiple imputation approach was used. A statistically significant 
difference in favor of sarilumab compared to adalimumab was also observed, which was similar with that in the 
primary analysis.

Subgroup analyses 
As illustrated in Figure 13 and Table 61, the superior efficacy (change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at Week 24) 
of sarilumab relative to adalimumab was consistent among subgroups for age, gender, race, region, or body 
weight. There was no evidence that duration of RA, number of prior DMARDS, MTX intolerance/inadequate 
response, or smoking history had an impact on comparative efficacy between the treatment groups. Baseline 
ESR, RF, anti-CCP did not emerge as relevant factors in the subgroup analyses for change in DAS28-ESR. 
There was a statistically significant interaction between treatment group and baseline CRP (p=0.0055, Table 
65); a larger treatment effect was seen in patients with baseline CRP > 15 mg/L compared with patients with an 
average baseline CRP ≤ 15 mg/mL (Figure 13). Nevertheless, the change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at Week 
24 was greater in the sarilumab group than in the adalimumab group across all categories of CRP.

Subgroup Analyses: DAS28-ESR remission at Week 24 
While there was a statistically significant interaction between baseline BMI and treatment group in DAS28-ESR 
remission (DAS28-ESR <2.6) at Week 24 (p=0.0094), where the smallest treatment effect was seen in patients 
with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, the overall number of patients achieving DAS28-ESR remission in each of the BMI 
categories was numerically greater in the sarilumab group than the adalimumab group (<25 kg/m2: 33.8% vs 
6.8%; ≥ 25 - <30 kg/m2: 25.7% vs 1.6%; ≥ 30 kg/m2: 16.3% vs 14.0%). A similar significant interaction 
between baseline BMI and treatment group for change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at Week 24 was also 
identified. 
In contrast to the change from baseline in DAS-ESR at Week 24, where a statistically significant interaction 
between treatment group and baseline CRP was identified, there was no significant interaction between baseline 
CRP and treatment group in DAS28-ESR remission. No other significant interaction was identified for the other 
factors, including baseline weight, and treatment group in the subgroup analyses for DAS28-ESR remission.

testing hierarchy, were consistent with the results at Week 24 (65.2% in the sarilumab group versus 54.6% in 
the adalimumab group, nominal p=0.0380. 
The ACR20 response generally increased over time for the sarilumab group, and was greater than the increases 
over time in the adalimumab group.

ACR50 response at Week 24 
The incidence of ACR50 response at Week 24 was statistically significantly greater in patients treated with 
sarilumab compared with patients treated with adalimumab. The results at Week 12, which were not part of the 
testing hierarchy, were consistent with the results at Week 24 (35.3% in the sarilumab group versus 20.5% in 
the adalimumab group, nominal p=0.0015. 
The ACR50 response generally increased over time for the sarilumab group and was greater than the increases

ACR70 Response at Week 24 
The incidence of ACR70 response at Week 24 was statistically significant in patients treated with sarilumab 
compared with patients treated with adalimumab. The results at Week 12, which were not part of the testing 
hierarchy, were consistent with the results at Week 24 (14.1% in the sarilumab group versus 6.5% in the

adalimumab group, nominal p=0.0154. The ACR70 response generally increased over time for the sarilumab 
group and was greater than the increases over time in the adalimumab group. 
Table 69: Incidence of ACR70 response at Week 24 - ITT population 
HAQ-DI at Week 24 
Table 70 shows that the improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline in the sarilumab group versus adalimumab group 
was statistically significant at Week 24. This improvement in HAQ-DI score was observed as early as Week 8 
(nominal p=0.0453), and generally increased over time. 
Superiority of sarilumab relative to adalimumab was demonstrated as measured by the proportion of patients 
with a clinically meaningful improvement in HAQ-DI (cutpoint 0.22) at Week 24 (67.4% versus 54.1% 
respectively; nominal p=0.0090). 
Superiority of sarilumab relative to adalimumab was also demonstrated in HAQ-DI using a higher cutpoint of 0.3 
at Week 24 (62.0% versus 47.6% respectively; nominal p=0.0057).

CDAI remission (CDAI <= 2.8) at Week 24 
The proportion of patients achieving CDAI remission (≤ 2.8) at Week 24 was more than twice that in the 
sarilumab group compared to the adalimumab group. The proportion of patients achieving CDAI remission at 
Week 12 was also higher in the sarilumab group compared to the adalimumab group (6.0% versus 3.2%; 
nominal p=0.2007). 
Ancillary analyses 
Quality of life / health related outcomes 
Change from baseline in SF-36 at Week 24 (physical and mental health components summary scores) 
At Week 24, the mean change from baseline in the PCS score in the sarilumab group was significantly greater 
than that in the adalimumab group. At Week 24, the mean change from baseline in the MCS score in the 
sarilumab group was numerically, but not significantly greater than that in the adalimumab group. 
Change from baseline in FACIT-Fatigue at Week 24 
The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire assessing fatigue and ranging from 0 to 52. A higher score 
corresponds to a lower level of fatigue. The FACIT-Fatigue scores evaluated at Week 24 were part of the 
hierarchical testing procedure, although it fell below the break for statistical significance. 
The change from baseline in the sarilumab group at Week 24 was numerically, but not significantly, superior to 
the adalimumab group. 
Change from baseline in EQ-5D at Week 24 
At Week 24, the mean change from baseline in the EQ-5D-3L index score in the sarilumab group was greater 
than that in the adalimumab group (nominal p=0.0382, Table 67). At Week 24, the mean change from baseline 
in the EQ-5D-3L VAS score in the sarilumab group was greater than that in the adalimumab group (nominal 
p=0.0699). 
Change from baseline in morning stiffness VAS 
Statistical significance of this endpoint is not claimed since it was not in the testing hierarchy.

At Week 24, the mean change from baseline in morning stiffness VAS score in the sarilumab group was greater 
than that in the adalimumab group (nominal p=0.0322). 
Change from baseline in RAID at Week 24 
Statistical significance of this endpoint is not claimed since it was not in the testing hierarchy. 
At Week 24, the mean change from baseline in the RAID score in the sarilumab group was greater than that in 
the adalimumab group (LS mean difference: 0.779; nominal p=0.0008). 
Change from baseline in WPS-RA at Week 24 
Statistical significance of this endpoint is not claimed since it was not in the testing hierarchy. One hundred and 
forty-seven (147) patients (40.1% of the sample) were employed at baseline. Since the WPS-RA consists of 
independent items, the O’Brien global test was first used to determine overall significance prior to further 
evaluation. The results of the test demonstrated an overall effect at Week 24 for the sarilumab group compared 
to adalimumab (nominal p=0.0039). At Week 24, the mean change from baseline in the sarilumab group was 
greater in all 8 components (absenteeism, presenteeism [productivity interference, productivity reduction], rate 
of RA interference in household work [days missed, productivity interference, productivity reduction], days 
missed in family, leisure and social activities, and hiring of outside help). Three components had a difference in 
favor of sarilumab with a nominal p value <0.05: household work days missed due to arthritis (nominal 
p=0.0211), days with household work productivity reduced by ≥  50% due to arthritis (nominal p=0.0032), and 
rate of arthritis interference with household work productivity (nominal p=0.0212). 
Immunogenicity 
A total of 184 patients had ADA results available; 98.9% of patients were ADA negative at baseline. 
The incidence of persistent positive ADA was 2.7%, as defined by a positive ADA response at the last sample in 
all 5 patients. The overall incidence of treatment emergent ADA positive patients was 7.1%. The majority of 
these patients had a transient positive response (8 of 13 patients). There was no neutralizing ADA among all 
patients who had positive ADA response. 
No patients who were positive in the ADA assay discontinued due to lack of efficacy or loss of efficacy. Although 
a higher incidence of ADA positive patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions compared with ADA negative 
patients, the overall number of patients was small (7/171 [4.1%] ADA negative patients versus 3/13 [23.1%] 
ADA positive patients with hypersensitivity reactions). The hypersensitivity reactions in the 3 ADA positive 
patients were mild, localized rashes. The ADA response was transient and the patients recovered for the 
hypersensitivity reactions without treatment interruption or discontinuation. There was no evidence of a direct 
relationship of the ADA formation and occurrence of these hypersensitivity reactions. There were no reported 
cases of anaphylaxis.

ACR20  is  defined  as  achieving  at  least  20% 
improvement in both TJC and SJC, and at least 
20%  improvement  in  at  least  3  of  the  5  other 
assessments (CRP level, patient’s assessment of 
pain,  patient’s  global  assessment  of  disease 
activity,  physician’s  global  assessment  of 
disease activity, HAQ-DI). 
Health Assessment Question-Disability Index. 
The  HAQ-DI  is  a  standardized  questionnaire 
developed for use in RA with a scoring range 
between 0 and 3. A high HAQ-DI score has been 
found to be a strong predictor of morbidity and 
mortality  in  RA.  A  0.22  unit  difference  is 
considered clinically meaningful. 
Disease  Activity  Score  (DAS)  28-  C  reactive 
protein (CRP). 
The  DAS28-CRP  is  a  composite  score  that 
includes 4 variables: 
• TJC (based on 28 joints) 
• SJC (based on 28 joints) 
•  general  health  assessment:  defined  as  the 
patient’s global assessment of disease activity 
• marker of inflammation: assessed by CRP 
(mg/L). 
ACR50 is defined similarly to ACR20 with at least 
a 50% improvement. 
ACR70 is defined similarly to ACR20 with at least 
a 70% improvement. 
DAS28-CRP remission is defined as a 
DAS28-CRP score <2.6.

CDAI 
HAQ-DI  
(week 24) 
SF-36 
Physical 
The  clinical  disease  activity  index  (CDAI)  is  a 
composite index constructed to measure clinical 
remission  in  RA  that  does  not  include  a 
laboratory test, and is a numerical summation of 
4 of the 
components of the SDAI (tender and SJC [based 
on 28 joints] as well as patient’s and physician’s 
global disease activity). Scores range from 0 to 
76. 
See above. 
The  SF-36  is  a  36  item  questionnaire  that 
measures  eight  multi-item  dimensions  of 
health:  physical  functioning  (10  items)  social 
functioning  (2  items)  role  limitations  due  to 
physical problems (4 items), role limitations due 
to emotional problems (3 items), mental health 
(5  items),  energy/vitality  (4  items),  pain  (2 
items), and general health perception (5 items). 
For  each  dimension,  item  scores  are  coded, 
summed, and transformed on to a scale from 0 
(worst  possible  health  state  measured  by  the 
questionnaire)  to  100  (best  possible  health 
state).  Two  standardised  summary  scores  can 
also be calculated from the SF-36; the physical 
component  summary  (PCS)  and  the  mental 
health component summary (MCS). 
SF-36 Mental 
See SF-36 Physical. 
FACIT fatigue 
Morning 
stiffness  
 WPS-RA 
The  FACIT-Fatigue  is  a  13-item  questionnaire 
rated 0 to 4 developed to measure fatigue. The 
patient will be asked to answer to 13 questions 
rated 0 to 4 (0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = 
somewhat, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much) (see 
Appendix J). The total score ranges from 0 to 52. 
Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with stiffness 
of  joints,  especially  in  the  morning  after 
prolonged  stationery  state.  The  degree  of 
stiffness can be an indicator of disease severity. 
The  effect  of  sarilumab  on  the  severity  of 
morning  stiffness  was  assessed  on  a  visual 
analog  scale  (VAS)  scale  from  0  mm  (no 
problem) to 100 mm (major problem). 
Rheumatoid  arthritis-work  productivity  survey 
(WPS-RA) 
The  WPS-RA  is  a  validated  questionnaire  that 
evaluates  productivity  limitations  within  work 
and  within  home  associated  with  RA  over  the 
previous  month.  The  questionnaire  was 
interviewer  administered  and  is  based  on 
patient  self-report.  It  contains  9  questions 
addressing  employment  status

RAID 
EQ-5D-3L 
RA impact of disease (RAID) 
(RAID)  score  is  a  composite  measure  of  the 
impact of RA on patients that takes into account 
7  domains:  pain,  functional  disability,  fatigue, 
physical  and  emotional  wellbeing,  quality  of 
sleep, and coping. The RAID is calculated based 
on  7  numerical  rating  scales  (NRS)  questions. 
Each  NRS  is  assessed  as  a  number  between  0 
and  10,  which  correspond  to  the  domains 
mentioned above. The values for each of these 
domains were weighted by patient assessment 
of relative importance and combined in a single 
score. 
It is a standardized, generic measure of health 
outcome. 
The EQ-5D was specifically included to address 
concerns regarding the health 
economic  impact  of  RA,  which  have  been 
considered  in  cost  effectiveness  arguments 
(~xr38i).  
The  EQ-5D-3L  comprises  5  questions  on 
mobility,  self-care,  pain,  usual  activities,  and 
psychological status with 3 possible answers for 
each 
(1=no  problem,  2=moderate 
problems,  3=severe  problems)  and  a  vertical 
visual  analog  scale  that  allows  the  patients  to 
indicate their health state today that can range 
imaginable)  to  100  (best 
from  0  (worst 
imaginable) (22).

HAQ-DI 
DAS28  is  a  composite  score  that  includes  4 
variables: TJC (based on 28 joints); SJC (based 
on 28 joints); general health assessment (GH) 
by the patient assessed from the ACR RA core 
set questionnaire (patient global assessment) in 
100 mm VAS; marker of inflammation assessed 
by the CRP in mg/L or ESR in mm/hr. 
DAS28-ESR remission is defined as a 
DAS28-ESR score <2.6 at Week 24. 
ACR50  is  defined  as  achieving  at  least  50% 
improvement in both TJC and SJC, and at least 
50%  improvement  in  at  least  3  of  the  5  other 
assessments (CRP level, patient’s assessment of 
pain,  patient’s  global  assessment  of  disease 
activity,  physician’s  global  assessment  of 
disease activity, HAQ-DI). 
ACR70 is defined similarly to ACR50 with at least 
a 70% improvement. 
ACR20 is defined similarly to ACR50 with at least 
a 20% improvement. 
Health Assessment Question-Disability Index. 
The  HAQ-DI  is  a  standardized  questionnaire 
developed for use in RA with a scoring range 
between 0 and 3. A high HAQ-DI score has been 
found to be a strong predictor of morbidity and 
mortality  in  RA.  A  0.22  unit  difference  is 
considered clinically meaningful.

SF-36 
Physical 
FACIT fatigue 
The  SF-36  is  a  36  item  questionnaire  that 
measures  eight  multi-item  dimensions  of 
health:  physical  functioning  (10  items)  social 
functioning  (2  items)  role  limitations  due  to 
physical problems (4 items), role limitations due 
to emotional problems (3 items), mental health 
(5  items),  energy/vitality  (4  items),  pain  (2 
items), and general health perception (5 items). 
For  each  dimension,  item  scores  are  coded, 
summed, and transformed on to a scale from 0 
(worst  possible  health  state  measured  by  the 
questionnaire)  to  100  (best  possible  health 
state).  Two  standardised  summary  scores  can 
also be calculated from the SF-36; the physical 
component  summary  (PCS)  and  the  mental 
health component summary (MCS). 
The  FACIT-Fatigue  is  a  13-item  questionnaire 
rated 0 to 4 developed to measure fatigue. The 
patient will be asked to answer to 13 questions 
rated 0 to 4 (0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = 
somewhat, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much) (see 
Appendix J). The total score ranges from 0 to 52.

Comparison of results in subpopulations 
Sarilumab + DMARDs - placebo-controlled studies 
Data from the 2 placebo-controlled studies were pooled to evaluate potential influence of demographic factors 
(gender,  race,  ethnicity,  region,  age,  weight,  BMI,  and  smoking  history),  baseline  disease  characteristics 
(duration  of  RA,  baseline  CRP,  DAS28-CRP,  serological  status),  prior  medication  history  (number  of  prior 
DMARDs, number of prior TNF antagonists [only collected in EFC10832], type of concomitant DMARD treatment 
[MTX,  non-MTX,  only  in  EFC10832])    on  the  key  efficacy  outcomes:  ACR20  response  rates  and  changes  in 
HAQ-DI, as well as changes in DAS28-CRP. Subgroup analyses for radiographic endpoints were only available 
from patients treated in EFC11072 Part B, Cohort 2. 
The efficacy results were consistent across subgroups based on age, gender, race, ethnicity, region, duration of 
RA, number of prior DMARDs, baseline DMARD treatment (specific to EFC10832), number of prior anti-TNFs 
(specific to EFC10832), baseline CRP or baseline DAS28-CRP.   
Monotherapy 
The subgroup analyses for EFC14092 were based on the subgroups defined for the pooled analysis of the 2 
placebo-controlled  studies  as  well  as  on  the  additional  subgroups  of  patients  who  had  either  an  inadequate 
response to or an intolerance of MTX and baseline ESR. In all of these subgroup analyses, sarilumab 200 mg q2w 
was consistently superior to adalimumab 40 mg q2w when administered as monotherapy. Potential interactions 
with  baseline  BMI  and  CRP  were  identified.    However,  these  interactions  were  not  observed  in  the  related 
subgroups of weight and ESR, respectively, and the efficacy results in these subgroups were consistent with the 
main results. 
Persistence of efficacy 
For long-term analyses, data from 901 patients initially randomized into EFC11072 Part B, Cohort 2 and from 
456 patients initially randomized into EFC10832 were pooled longitudinally with data from the open-label 
long-term extension study, LTS11210.  Patients initially randomized into EFC11072 Part B, Cohort 2 had up to 
approximately 196 weeks of continuous treatment with sarilumab, and patients initially randomized into 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017

EFC10832 had up to approximately 108 weeks of continuous treatment with sarilumab.  From the time of entry 
into LTS11210, patients were treated with sarilumab 200 mg q2w with dose reductions to 150 mg q2w for 
laboratory abnormalities (decreases in ANC, platelets or increases in transaminases). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in paediatric patients, renal and hepatic impaired patients were conducted. 
A summary of the number of elderly patients from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in different age group (age ≥ 65) 
is presented in Table 78.

Supportive study 
The OL long term study LTS11210 
LTS11210 is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, uncontrolled long-term study with the primary objective 
to evaluate sarilumab long-term safety and the secondary objective to assess sarilumab efficacy in patients with 
RA. 
The  figure  below  summarizes  the  patient  population,  and  number  of  patients  from  the  initial  studies  that 
enrolled into LTS11210 and represented the overall safety population, N=2023 [(sarilumab + DMARD safety

Figure 15: Schematic of patient population with RA who entered from the initial studies 
Upon entry into LTS11210, the patients all received sarilumab 200 mg q2w, with reductions to 150 mg q2w for 
certain  laboratory  abnormalities  (with  a  stable  dose  of  one  or  a  combination  of  the  conventional  synthetic 
DMARDs  they  were  receiving,  except  for  patients  from  EFC13752  who  were  only  receiving  sarilumab 
monotherapy). 
Study duration: the study is ongoing. The treatment duration for a patient in the study is at least 264 weeks 
from the first IMP administration in LTS11210. In addition, patients may continue to be treated beyond 264 
weeks until sarilumab is commercially available or until 2020, at the latest, when the study will be closed. 
Number of patients 
Planned: Approximately 2000 patients 
Enrolled: 1912 (sarilumab + DMARD); 111 (sarilumab monotherapy) 
Treated: 1910 (sarilumab + DMARD); 111 (sarilumab monotherapy). All treated subjects were evaluated for the 
efficacy and safety endpoints.  
Data extraction date: 25 January 2016. 
Evaluation of the efficacy data will be focused on the subjects from the placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (i.e.,

SFY13370 
This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 24-week study assessing the safety and tolerability of 
sarilumab and tocilizumab with the primary objective to assess the safety of sarilumab and tocilizumab in the 
same study.  
SFY13370 was conducted in patients with RA based on the 2010 ACR/EULAR diagnostic criteria and defined as 
moderately to severely active based on joint counts and baseline CRP levels. These patients had to have an 
inadequate  response  to  or  an  intolerance  of  at  least  1  TNF  antagonist  and  continued  their  treatment  with 
conventional DMARDs (MTX, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, hydroxycholorquine) at baseline and continued these 
DMARDs during the study. 
Sarilumab was administered subcutaneously (SC) 150 mg q2w or 200 mg q2w. Tocilizumab was administered 
intravenously with an initial dose regimen of 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks (q4w) with the option to increase the dose 
to 8 mg/kg q4w at the Investigator’s discretion. 
A total of 202 patients were randomized and treated (49, 51, and 102 in the sarilumab 150 mg q2w, sarilumab 
200 mg q2w, and tocilizumab 4 mg/kg groups, respectively). 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced among the treatment groups. 
A total of 60.8% of tocilizumab patients had a dose increase from 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg during the treatment 
period; 42.4% of patients increased their dose at Week 4. Among the tocilizumab patients who up-titrated to 8 
mg/kg; there were 4 patients who later reduced their dose to 4 mg/kg primarily due to adverse safety findings.

Within the limitations of this study, which was not designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of sarilumab 
and tocilizumab, efficacy responses were similar between the treatment groups. 
EFC13752 
This was an open-label, parallel-group, 24-week study assessing the immunogenicity and safety of sarilumab as 
monotherapy in patients with RA. Patients were randomized to receive sarilumab 150 or 200 mg q2w. 
A total of 132 patients were randomized and treated (65 in the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and 67 in sarilumab 
200 mg q2w group). 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced among the treatment groups. 
Within the limitations of this study, which was not designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of the 2 dose 
regimens of sarilumab, efficacy responses were similar between the treatment groups. 
MSC12665 
MSC12665 was a multicenter study to evaluate the usability of a sarilumab AI device conducted in patients with 
RA based on the 2010 ACR/EULAR diagnostic criteria and defined as moderately to severely active based on joint 
counts  and  baseline  CRP  levels.  Patients  were  on  conventional  DMARDs  (MTX,  leflunomide,  sulfasalazine, 
hydroxycholorquine) at baseline and continued these DMARDs during the study. This study was divided into 2 
parts: a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 12-week study in which patients were randomized 
to 1 of 4 arms to receive sarilumab 150 mg or 200 mg q2w delivered using the AI or prefilled syringe (PFS), and 
a 12-month extension part in which all patients received sarilumab 150 mg q2w delivered using the PFS. Only 
the 12-week data are presented in the CSR; the extension phase of this study is ongoing. 
A total of 217 patients were randomized and treated (53 in the sarilumab 150 mg q2w PFS group, 56 in the 
sarilumab  150 mg  q2w  AI  group,  56  in  sarilumab  200  mg  q2w  PFS  group,  52  in  sarilumab  200  mg  q2w  AI 
group). Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced among the treatment groups. 
The primary endpoint was the number of AI-associated product technical failures reported during that 12-week 
part. None occurred among the 600 injections performed in 108 patients, which confirmed the usability of this

Within the limitations of this study, which was not designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of the 2 dose 
regimens of sarilumab, efficacy responses were similar between the treatment groups. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Four  Phase  3  efficacy  studies,  designed  to  assess  the  treatment  responses  of  sarilumab  in  moderately  to 
severely active RA, were conducted: EFC11072 (2-part study, Phase II/III), EFC10832, EFC14092, LTS11210. 
The effect of sarilumab in add on to MTX/cDMARDs in c-DMARD-IR and b-DMARD-IR subjects, was assessed in 
studies EFC11072 and EFC10832.  
EFC11072  was  a  2-part,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  conducted  in  patients  with  an  inadequate 
response to MTX. In this study, sarilumab or placebo was administered in combination with MTX. This study is

completed. Part A was the 12-week Phase 2, dose-ranging part of the study; Part B was the 52-week, Phase 3 
part of the study. 
In the dose-ranging study EFC11072 Part A 306 patients with moderately to severely active RA who had an 
inadequate response to MTX were included. With regard to the in- and exclusion criteria the population defined 
was  relevant  for  dose  finding.  Five  dose  regimens  of  sarilumab  were  tested,  the  study  design  was 
comprehensible. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were well balanced among the treatment 
groups.  
The primary endpoint ACR 20 at week 12 as well as the secondary endpoints (ACR50/70, change from baseline 
in each of the seven  ACR  components, change from baseline in DAS28, DAS28 remission, EULAR response, 
ACRn  at  week  12)  are  in  line  with  the  recommendations  made  in  the  “Points  to  Consider  on  the  Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products other than NSAIDs in Rheumatoid Arthritis”. 
EFC11072 Part B  
After Part A of EFC11072 was fully enrolled, Part B was initiated and patients were randomly assigned using the 
same strategy as in Part A.  
The inclusion criteria were identical to part A but comprised one bone erosion or anti-CCP positive status or RF 
positive status in addition. The 3 co-primary endpoints (ACR20, change of HAQ-DI, change in van der Heijde 
modified tSS) and the main secondary endpoint (Major clinical response defined as the event of achieving and 
maintaining  an  ACR  70  response  for  at  least  24  consecutive  weeks)  reflect  the  objectives,  namely  to 
demonstrate that sarilumab added to MTX is effective in reduction of signs and symptoms, in the inhibition of 
progression of structural damage and in the improvement in physical function,  adequately and are in line with  
the recommendations made in the “Points to Consider on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products other 
than NSAIDs in Rheumatoid Arthritis”. 
EFC10832  was  a  24-week,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  in  patients  with  a  history  of 
TNF-IR.  In  this  study,  sarilumab  or  placebo  was  administered  in  combination  with  MTX,  sulfasalazine, 
hydroxychloroquine, or leflunomide. This study is completed. 
In contrast to study EFC11072 and EFC10832 the duration of RA of the included patients had to be at least 6 
months (instead of 3 months), the definition of moderate to severely active RA was comparable to that in these 
previous studies. Besides MTX other DMARDs such as Leflunomide, Sulfasalazine and Hydroxychloroquine were 
allowed. The objectives (reduction of signs and symptoms, improvement in physical function, improvement of 
disease  activity  score  and  of  quality  of  life)  were  reflected  by  the  primary  (ACR20,  HAQ-DI)  and  secondary 
endpoints. 
Both studies, EFC11072 and EFC10832, in line with current guidelines for the management of moderately to 
severely  active  RA  subjects,  allowed  rescue  treatment  in  inadequate  responders.  However,  the  definition  of 
non-responder  is  not  based  on  disease  sign  and  symptoms,  and  thus  does  not  allow  to  fully  characterize 
treatment  efficacy.  In  addition,  different  treatment  periods  (16  and  12  weeks  for  the  MTX-IR  and  TNF-IR 
subjects,  respectively)  were  used  to  check  for  treatment  response,  further  challenging  the  possibility  to 
extrapolate clear information for potential recommendation in the SmPC. 
The effect of sarilumab monotherapy in subjects who responded inadequately or were intolerant to MTX was 
assessed in study  EFC14092. This study was designed to provide the evidence of sarilumab administered as 
monotherapy and to provide the context for the efficacy of sarilumab relative to that of an approved biologic 
DMARD. Adalimumab, a TNF-a-inhibitor, was chosen as a comparator. This was considered acceptable.

EMA/292840/2017

EFC14092  was  a  Phase  3,  2-part,  study:  Part  1  was  a  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind, 
double-dummy 24-week treatment period that enrolled patients who were either intolerant of, or considered 
inappropriate  candidates  for  continued  treatment  with  MTX,  or  who,  after  at  least  12  weeks  of  continued 
treatment with MTX, were determined to be inadequate responders. In this study, sarilumab or adalimumab 
were administered as monotherapy. In Part 2, the open-label extension, all patients were to receive sarilumab 
as monotherapy. Part 1 is completed; Part 2 is ongoing. The final report for this study is expected no later than 
the end of 2021. 
The  duration  of  RA  had  to  be  at  least  3  months;  this  inclusion  criterion  was  the  same  as  the  one  in  study 
EFC11072.  The  choice  of  DAS28-ESR  as  a  primary  endpoint  to  demonstrate  that  sarilumab  is  superior  to 
adalimumab monotherapy with respect to signs and symptoms is acceptable. Regarding the baseline data the 
population  in  the  sarilumab  group  was  a  bit  younger  (-2.7  years)  and  regarding  the  baseline  disease 
characteristics  patients  on  sarilumab  had  a  longer  duration  of  RA  and  lower  baseline  CRP  compared  to 
adalimumab.  However,  DAS28-CRP  and  DAS28-ESR  values,  as  well  as  HAQ-DI  and  CDAI  scores  were 
comparable between treatment groups.  
Overall, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar in all three phase 3 trials, and are considered overall 
adequate to identify the patient population covered by the indication. 
Co-primary efficacy endpoints of all Phase 3 studies are in compliance with the requirements of the relevant EMA 
guideline on medicinal products for the treatment of RA, as they aimed at evaluating treatment effect on signs 
and symptoms (ACR20 response), physical function (change from baseline in HAQ-DI), and for EFC11072 Part 
B only, progression in structural damage (mTSS). The endpoints were analysed in a step-down hierarchy to 
avoid multiplicity issues. 
LTS11210 is an ongoing long-term, open-label, Phase 3, uncontrolled extension study. Patients from EFC11072 
and EFC10832 were allowed to enter this study. Data from LTS11210 are provided up through the CTD cut-off 
date of 25 January 2016.  
With regard to efficacy the study results have to be interpreted with caution as this is an open label trial without 
internal control. Furthermore, the efficacy analyses do not account for dropouts. Thus the efficacy results are 
likely to be biased. 
Of note, the route of administration slightly differed between the different studies: 
EFC14092: SC in abdomen or front of thigh, EFC10832: SC in abdomen, thigh or upper arm, EFC11072: SC in 
abdomen. However, this seems to be a minor difference that does not affect the outcomes of the studies. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Sarilumab in add on to MTX/cDMARDs in c-DMARD-IR and b-DMARD-IR subjects 
The  enrolled  patient  population  in  both  EFC11072  part  B  and  EFC10832  studies  is  considered  sufficiently 
representative of the target population of moderately to severely active RA subjects. However, the proportion of 
EU patients enrolled in the EFC11072 trial is very low (less than 20%), and could put into question the external 
validity of the study. 
Further  data  was  provided  in  order  to  support  the  broad  comparability  among  the  EU  population  and  non 
EU-population of the the EFC11072, Part B, Cohort 2 study and the subjects (EU and not EU) enrolled in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 149/189 
  
  
other pivotal studies (EFC10832 and EFC14092) in terms of baseline and disease characteristics as well in terms 
of efficacy outcomes. Therefore, the external validity of the study results for the EU population is confirmed.  
Of note, roughly 30% of subjects in Study EFC11072 had previously received b-DMARD, without experiencing 
inadequate  response  leading  to  treatment  interruption  in  the  previous  3  months.  The  distribution  of  these 
patients in the 3 arms of the trial was provided during the evaluation procedure. 
Similar proportion of patients completed the 2 studies. Rescued subjects were 3 fold higher in the PLB+MTX arm 
as compared to sarilumab+MTX arms (slightly higher in the sarilumab lower dose). Discontinuation ranged from 
9% to 12% in PLB+MTX and from 14% to 20% in sarilumab+MTX arms, with the lower rates being observed in 
the TNF-ir patients; safety issues were the most common reason for discontinuation in all arms of both studies. 
Patients considered as non-responders (rescued or discontinued) were about 43% -50% in the PLB+MTX arms 
and  30%  in  sarilumab+MTX  arms.  The  percentage  of  patients  with  insufficient  data  considered  as 
non-responders was very low and therefore a potential impact on the estimation of treatment effect is excluded.  
In the dose-ranging study EFC11072 Part A the highest ACR20 response rate occurred in the 150 mg qw 
treatment group, but with respect to the other endpoints, the 150 mg once weekly dose was not more effective 
than some of the lower doses evaluated. Only a trend was seen in the 150 mg q2w, 100 mg qw, and 200 mg q2w 
sarilumab treatment arms regarding the ACR20 response. 
The ACR50 response rates were highest for the 100 mg qw (nominal p = 0.0062) and 200 mg q2w (nominal p 
= 0.0038) groups. The response rate of patients achieving ACR70 at Week 12 was also highest in the 200 mg 
q2w group with nominal p = 0.0078 compared with placebo. 
In Part B of the study the dose of 200 mg q2w respectively 150 mg q2w was administered. With regard to the 
abovementioned findings in the dose-ranging Part A of the study the dose of 150 qw would have been suitable 
to use as this dose was the maximally effective dose based on the results of the ACR20 response. As a 
q2w-regimen compared to a qw-regimen allows fewer applications for the patients the choice of 200 mg q2w - 
which was the effective dose regarding the more clinically meaningful parameters ACR50 and ACR70 - is 
acceptable. The choice of 150 mg q2w as a second possible dose for a biweekly regimen is acceptable as well 
because there has been seen a trend for efficacy concerning ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70. 
The ACR20 response rates of sarilumab 150 mg q2w and of 200 mg q2w were similar, but the response rates for 
ACR50 and ACR70 were numerically superior regarding the 200 mg q2w dose. In addition, results for certain 
components of the ACR score, specifically Pain and physician global assessment, were better for the 200 mg q2w 
dose. Therefore, the choice of the 200 mg q2w dose as the standard dose and 150 mg q2w as the other possible 
dose is acceptable 
Both doses of sarilumab (150/200mg q2w) were statistically significant superior to placebo regarding all 3 
co-primary endpoints (ACR20, HAQ-DI, mTSS) in study EFC11072 Part B.  
A gain over placebo of 33% was observed in the first co-primary endpoint, ACR20 response, at week 24, in 
EFC11072 and EFC10832 studies respectively, with 66.4% of patients obtaining ACR20 response. The 
amelioration of signs and symptoms appeared early than 24 weeks and was maintained up to 52 weeks.  
The data collected after treatment discontinuation or rescue were set to missing and the patients were 
considered as non-responders after that time. Since treatment discontinuation and rescue were, overall, more 
frequent in the control group, this approach tends to overestimate the treatment effect. The proposed 
sensitivity analysis using the LOCF method to impute missing data is not reassuring about the robustness of the 
estimation of treatment effect, given that the LOCF analysis, in such scenario, is likely to be anti-conservative, 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 150/189 
  
  
especially if treatment discontinuation is observed earlier in the control group. A more conservative approach 
was considered to be required.  
Sensitivity analysis based on a conservative approach was not provided. However, according to the Applicant 
explanation, as the majority of missing data was due to rescue therapy and lack of efficacy, it is agreed that such 
a conservative approach could be applied only to a small percentage of patients (discontinued due to adverse 
events). Therefore, a potential impact on the estimation of treatment effect should be negligible. 
The sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary results. Linear extrapolation was used to impute 
missing information or post rescue week 52 data, based on the assumption of linearity on bone damage over 
time. Different sensitivity analyses were performed, all supportive of the primary analysis. In addition to the 
sensitivity analyses performed in the CSR the Applicant conducted two additional sensitivity analyses of mTSS 
using pattern mixture models (PMM). In both analyses, all observed X-ray assessments after one year were 
analyzed including those after rescue. In the first of these analyses the data for patients who did not have a 
X-ray at one year, was imputed based on a ‘switch to control’ assumption in which the missing data was based 
on the observed one year results in the placebo group. In the second analysis, the multiple imputation procedure 
was based on a ‘copy increment from reference’ approach in which missing data due to efficacy and safety (ie 
discontinuations due to lack of efficacy, AE, or rescue) was imputed based on the placebo group, but the placebo 
progression was assumed to apply only from the point in time at which the last X-ray was observed, and not for 
the full one year. Missing data for other reasons (such as unreadable X-rays) was assumed missing at random.  
These analyses confirmed the results of the primary analysis at week 52 and the secondary analysis at week 24. 
However, none of the applied sensitivity analyses may completely overcome the potential for overestimation of 
treatment effect.  Because of the high number of patients who discontinued or were rescued, the Applicant was 
asked to provide analyses of the time to rescue and time to withdrawal. The Applicant provided time-to-event 
analysis, were the initialization of rescue medication is considered as censoring in the time-to-discontinuation 
analysis.  
Rescue medication is given for a much higher number of patients in the placebo group and a slightly higher 
number in the sarilumab 150mg q2w group. Especially in the placebo group, rescue medication is initiated in a 
substantial number of patients at each visit (after week 16) and only a few patients who initialize rescue 
medication in between scheduled visits. Overall, the frequency of rescue medication cumulates to over 40% in 
the placebo group and stays approximately at approximately 13% to 15% in the sarilumab groups. These 
estimates are slightly higher than raw frequencies and are considered more accurate as they appropriately take 
censoring into account. 
Time dependent discontinuation rates and AE related discontinuation rates are higher (or at least not less) in 
sarilumab patients throughout the whole study period than in placebo patients. Discontinuation rates seem 
more or less constant over time. Overall discontinuation rates are over 20% for all study groups, and around 
10% (placebo) to 17% (sarilumab) for AE related discontinuation. These estimates are slightly higher than raw 
frequencies and are considered more accurate as they appropriately take censoring into account. 
Overall, the pattern is as expected. These findings concerning the probability of discontinuation seem to be 
reasonable due to the AEs that are connected with the sarilumab treatment compared to placebo. The findings 
regarding the probability of rescue seem to favour the efficacy of sarilumab, especially used in the higher dose.  
Supportive evidence of a positive sarilumab effect on bone damage is provided by the greater (p <0.0001) 
proportion of sarilumab-treated patients with no progression of structural damage compared to placebo, as 
shown by the conservative analysis evaluating treatment effect on the binary endpoint progression/no 
Assessment report

Page 151/189 
  
  
progression. The effect on progressive structural damage was sustained upon continued treatment for up to 3 
years.  Of note, the evaluation of RX scans indicated a larger reduction of radiographic progression in bone 
structural damage in subjects initially randomized to sarilumab 200 mg q2w as compared to those who started 
treatment with sarilumab 150 mg q2w. 
As it its mentioned in the” Points to Consider on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products other than 
NSAIDs in Rheumatoid Arthritis” for agents which are claimed to prevent structural joint damage it is 
recommended to demonstrate radiological differences of hands and forefeet on the basis of before/after 
comparisons taken not less than one year apart, ideally for two years. Therefore the 1-year-data provided 
regarding mTSS could be regarded as sufficient but not as convincing as it could be. The main secondary 
endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving major clinical response, was met: The 200 mg q2w group was 
slightly better than the 150 mg q2w group of sarilumab (14,8%, 12,8%, placebo 3,0%). Sarilumab was in both 
doses superior to placebo (p<0.0001) regarding the other secondary endpoints in the hierarchy concerning the 
improvement of signs and symptoms (ACR50/70, DAS28-CRP, CDAI-scores).  
No evidence of interaction was found for most subgroup analyses. However, the following interactions were 
found: 
• The incidence of ACR20 interaction for the anti-CCP antibody subgroup (nominal p-value=0.001), indicating a 
lower ACR20 response in anti-CCP antibody negative patients 
•  The  change  from  baseline  in  HAQ-DI,  for  the  anti-CCP  antibody  subgroup  (nominal  p-value=0.0028), 
indicating a lower HAQ-DI change in anti-CCP antibody negative patients 
•  The  change  from  baseline  in  HAQ-DI,  for  the  rheumatoid  factor  subgroup  (nominal  p-value=0.0417), 
indicating a lower HAQ-DI change in rheumatoid factor negative patients 
• The change from baseline in mTSS, for the smoking history subgroup (self-reported positive smoking history, 
current or former, versus negative smoking history) (nominal p-value=0.0412), indicating a greater change in 
mTSS in patients with a history of smoking 
Study EFC10832 showed that both doses of sarilumab were superior to placebo when added to background 
DMARDs for the treatment of moderate to severe RA patients who had inadequate response to or were intolerant 
of anti-TNF-a therapies. Both primary endpoints (ACR20 response at week 24, change from baseline in HAQ-DI 
score at week 12) were met. Patients who were negative for autoantibodies (RF or anti-CCP)  had a smaller 
treatment  effect  with  regard  to  ACR20  and  HAQ-DI.  The  secondary  endpoints  in  the  hierarchy  (ACR50/70, 
decrease in DAS28-CRP, DAS28-CRP <2.6 (remission) were met, too. Results of all ACR core set components 
and quality of life analyses (PCS of SF-36) support the superiority of both doses of sarilumab to placebo. 
This  study  was  not  powered  to  evaluate  potential  differences  between  doses,  only  a  trend  was  observed 
regarding different efficacy parameters that 200 mg q2w are superior to the sarilumab dose of 150 mg q2w. 
Subgroups  analyses  showed  that  in  study  EFC11072  autoantibody  (i.e. RF  and  anti-CCP)  positivity  was  a 
co-variate impacting on improvement in signs and symptoms (ACR20 for anti-CCP) and functional activity (for 
RF and anti-CCP). However, this was not confirmed in study EFC10832. Moreover, the lower ACR response in 
negative RF or anti-CCP subjects was not seen in radiologic outcomes for bone structural progression.  
From a clinical perspective, it is remarkable the superiority of the combination sarilumab+MTX over PBL+MTX in 
achieving and maintaining ACR70 for at least 24 consecutive weeks during the 52-week period.  
It is of note that, some secondary endpoints related to the evaluation of QoL were only met by the 150mg q2w 
sarilumab dose in both EFC11072 and EFC10832 studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017

Ancillary  analyses  taking  into  account  other  endpoints  e.g.  Boolean-based  ACR/EULAR  remission,  SDAI  and 
CDAI indexes, were in line with the results of the primary analysis. 
In study EFC14092 the primary endpoint of change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at week 24 was met, therefore 
sarilumab 200 mg q2w administered as monotherapy was superior to adalimumab 40 mg q2w monotherapy. 
The results of the sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint were consistent with those from the primary 
analyses. Treatment effect was seen already at 3 months post treatment. It is of note that although the total 
proportion  of  responders  was  higher  in  the  sarilumab  arm  (49  subjects  versus  13)  a  higher  proportion  of 
Adalimumab-treated subjects obtained 0 active joints (tender or swollen or both), likely meaning that in those 
few Adalimumab responders the anti-inflammatory effect exerted by the drug is more profound. 
The secondary endpoint, incidence of DAS28-ESR remission (DAS28-ESR <2.6), was also met. That means that 
significantly more patients treated with sarilumab than adalimumab achieved DAS28-ESR remission (26.6% vs. 
7%,  p<0.0001).  With  regard  to  the  other  secondary  endpoints  ACR/2050/70  sarilumab  demonstrated 
superiority to adalimumab. Sarilumab showed better improvement of physical function, measured by HAQ-DI, 
than adalimumab. 
Partial  improvements  were  seen  in  QoL  measures  (few  endpoints  were  statistically  superior  others  only 
numerically higher). 
In  all  subgroups  including  those  defined  by  autoantibody  status,  sarilumab  monotherapy  was  superior  to 
adalimumab monotherapy  
The  subgroup  analyses  revealed  a  possible  interaction  between  baseline  BMI  and  treatment  group  for  both 
change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at Week 24; with the smallest between group differences appearing in the 
subgroup with a baseline body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2. However, this category of patients was poorly 
represented, and no interaction with BMI or body weight was detected in the two add-on studies. No significant 
interaction  was  identified  between  baseline  weight  and  treatment  group  for  change  from  baseline  in 
DAS28-ESR. In addition, regarding DAS28-ESR remission (DAS28-ESR <2.6) there was a statistically significant 
interaction between baseline BMI and treatment group at Week 24 (p=0.0094), where the smallest treatment 
effect was seen in patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. 
In the analysis of ACR20 and DAS28 CRP responses using pooled data from EFC11072 and EFC10832 studies, 
the magnitude of treatment effect with sarilumab 150 mg dose was the lowest in the categories of both BMI≥30 
kg/m2  and  body  weight  >100  kg.  Furthermore  PK  data  showed  that  exposure  to  sarilumab  varied  across 
different groups of body weight, and population PK analyses indicated lower exposure to sarilumab at weights 
≥100 kg. An exposure-response analysis was thus requested to substantiate or negate the clinical relevance of 
the observation (see PK section). 
Exposure-response (E - R) analyses of ACR20 and DAS28-CRP change from baseline at Week 24 were conducted 
by pooling data from Study EFC11072, Part B, Cohort 2 and Study EFC10832. 
Modeling approaches were similar to those used in the previous empirical E-R modeling of efficacy endpoints for 
each study (Study POH0455. The Pharmacokinetics (PK)/Pharmacodynamics (PD) model was used to provide 
model predictions with 95% CI for each dose (150 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w) difference from placebo in each 
bodyweight subgroup.  The body weight and BMI were evaluated as covariates in the E-R analyses of ACR20 and 
DAS-CRP response using pooled data from EFC11072, Part B and EFC10832 studies. With the body weight effect 
in PK/PD accounted for in the PK model, the secondary effect of body weight on effect was not included in the E-R 
model or only had marginal effects, which is consistent with the previously submitted E-R analyses for these end 
points in Study POH0455 
Assessment report

A larger between-group difference in change in DAS28-ESR from baseline at Week 24 appeared among patients 
with an average baseline CRP >15 mg/mL compared with patients with an average baseline CRP ≤ 15 mg/mL. 
No  significant  interaction  between  the  subgroups  of  baseline  CRP  or  ESR  was  identified  for  the  incidence  of 
DAS28-ESR remission. In all these subgroups, sarilumab was superior to adalimumab. 
As study LTS11210 is an open label study, which is ongoing, the results must be evaluated with caution and are 
only preliminary. Data collected over 3 years (1 year in EFC11072 and 2 years in LTS11210) were evaluated.  
In  the  group  of  patients  who  received  sarilumab  and  DMARDs  the  proportion  of  patients  with  ACR20/50/70 
responses  and  DAS28  remission  was  maintained  (i.e.,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  ACR20  response  kept 
increasing over time, reaching up to ~90% after 264 weeks of treatment in the safety population.). Throughout 
the treatment period and the effect of sarilumab on the ACR core set components was maintained over time.  
However, the results of this LTE study have to be evaluated with caution as the placebo effect in the data has to 
be taken into consideration. 
Of note, patients originally randomized to receive sarilumab 150 mg q2w (study EFC11072, study EFC10832), 
upon switching to 200 mg q2w, achieved nearly comparable responses to those originally randomized to 200 mg 
q2w  (LTS11210),  although  differences  in  radiographic  progression  of  bone  damage  were  still  apparent  both 
after 2 years (mTSS: 0.23, 200 mg q2w vs. 1.05, 150 mg q2w) and 3 years of treatment (mTSS: 0.79, 200 mg 
q2w vs. 1.87, 150 mg q2w).  
In  the  3  year  analysis  of  mTSS  the  score  increased  by  2.14  units  from  baseline  to  year  3  and  the  rate  of 
nonprogression from baseline was 44.2%. 
Consistent results were obtained for the two populations of patients rolling over from the two studies EFC11072 
and  EFC10832,  with  a  predictable  trend  of  a  lower percentage of  responses  in  TNF-IR  subjects  (from  study 
EFC10832) as compared to MTX-IR ones (from study EFC11072). However, study LTS11210 data interpretation 
is confounded by the use of both C1P2F2 DP in vials and C2P1F3 DP in PFS. Clarification on DPs comparability 
and on the potential impact of differences between the two DPs on LTS11210 study results was given by the 
Applicant supporting that the contribution of patients treated with C1P2F2 drug product in vials was limited 
(roughly 7.6% of cumulative exposure to sarilumab in LTS11210 derived from patients enrolled in EFC11072, 
Part A who received C1P2F2 drug product in vials; beyond 96 weeks, <0.001% of data can be attributed to 
patients who received C1P2F2 drug product in vials). Therefore, the potential impact on LTS11210 study could 
be reasonably excluded. Efficacy data for patients with sarilumab monotherapy were limited. The proportion of 
patients  with  ACR20/50/70  repsonses  and  DAS28  remission  was  improved  or  maintained  and  the  effect  of 
sarilumab on the ACR core set components was maintained. 
The  pooled  analyses  of  EFC11072  Part  B  and  EFC10832  showed  that  the  response  to  sarilumab  150  mg  is 
influenced by weight and BMI but not by other demographic characteristics. 
Patients with weights ≥ 100 kg had the lowest ACR20 response rates with sarilumab 150 mg q2w and smallest 
change from baseline in DAS28-CRP while they generally responded to sarilumab 200 mg q2w. There was no 
significant association of weight with radiographic outcomes. 
In analyses based on relatively small numbers of patients, patients who received sarilumab 150 mg q2w and 
who were negative regarding  both autoantibodies were less likely to have had an improvement ACR20 and 
change from baseline in DAS28-CRP compared with patients randomized to sarilumab 200 mg q2w. 
The starting dose of sarilumab 200 mg q2w seems to be acceptable from a point of view concerning the efficacy. 
The Applicant appropriately discussed the higher rate of fatal infections and sepsis cases at the high dose level 
of  sarilumab  with  the  longer  duration  of  exposure  to  sarilumab  treatment.  Furthermore,  the  inhibition  of

structural damage is better for the 200 mg q2w dose compared to the lower dose, especially a starting dose of 
200 mg q2w leads to a better outcome regarding structural damage compared to the effects gained by a switch 
from the lower to the high dose. The post-hoc analysis of the data of study MSC12655 indicates that, for some 
patients,  a  switch  from  the  high  to  the  low  dose  of  sarilumab  did  not  result  in  maintenance  of  the  disease 
remission (DAS28-CRP <2.6). 
The  possibility  to  decrease  the  dose  of  sarilumab  in  case  of  laboratory  abnormalities  (decreases  in  ANC  or 
platelets or increased transaminases) is given (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
The data derived from patients who decreased their sarilumab dose from 200 mg q2w to 150 mg q2w, although 
with some limitations, indicate maintenance of treatment effect up to 24 weeks. Unfortunately, no long-term 
data on bone damage is available following sarilumab dose reduction, and as such no conclusion on this aspect 
is at present possible.  However, the observation that the rate of remissions is maintained and even numerically 
increased after 24 weeks from dose decrease is considered sufficiently reassuring to recommend dose decrease 
to 150 mg q2w in case of laboratory abnormalities.  
The available evidence on sarilumab efficacy after dose increase from 150 mg q2w to 200 mg q2w, together with 
the overall efficacy data from the pivotal trials showing a trend towards a better performance of the 200 mg q2w 
dose  vs  150  mg  q2w  dose,  is  considered  sufficiently  supportive  to  recommend,  in  the  proposed  SmPC,  the 
increase in sarilumab dose after reduction to 150 mg q2w in case of laboratory abnormalities. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data of the two phase 3 placebo-controlled studies in patients who received background DMARDs 
showed that both dose regimens of sarilumab (150 mg q2w, 200 mg q2w) were superior to placebo regarding 
improvement of signs and symptoms (ACR20 responses), of physical function (change from baseline in HAQ-DI) 
and of progression in structural damage (mTSS, only study EFC11072). 
The active-comparator study demonstrated the efficacy of sarilumab as monotherapy and relative to the biologic 
DMARD adalimumab. 
Overall, data of the submitted studies are considered overall adequate to identify the patient population of the 
indication.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety assessment of sarilumab is mainly based on the integrated safety analysis of nine Phase 2 and 3 
studies. The integrated safety database for sarilumab in RA includes patients enrolled in the global RA studies 
who received at least 1 dose of sarilumab with or without DMARDS.  
A total of 3354 patients having received at least 1 dose of sarilumab±DMARD in the global Phase 2 and 3 RA 
clinical  development  program,  providing  5981.0  patient-years  of  cumulative  exposure,  are  included  in  the 
integrated  safety  analysis.  Of  these,  2887  patients  were  on  background  DMARD  therapy;  and  467  patients 
received sarilumab as monotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 155/189 
  
  
For the purpose of the analysis the patients were dived in 3 different pools: placebo-controlled population (Pool 
1), sarilumab+DMARD long-term safety population (Pool 2), and sarilumab monotherapy population (Pool 3). 
The  patients  from  the  placebo-controlled  population  who  were  on  sarilumab  are  also  included  in  the 
sarilumab+DMARD  long-term  safety  population  (Pool  2).  Pool  1  includes  safety  data  collected  during  the 
double-blind  treatment  period.  Once  a  patient  entered  the  rescue  period,  defined  as  the  day  when  the  first 
open-label dose of sarilumab was administered, data were no longer included. Duration of treatment for Pool 1 
is up to 52 weeks. Pool 2 consists of all patients who received any dose of sarilumab + DMARD; the maximum 
duration of treatment observed is 5.4 years. Pool 3 consists of patients who received sarilumab as monotherapy. 
The  review  of  safety  data  in  this  population  allows  for  an  assessment  of  the  safety  of  sarilumab  when 
administered without concomitant DMARDs. The majority of the data are derived from patients treated with 
sarilumab 200 mg q2w. 
In all Phase 2/3 studies (except monotherapy studies) patients received background therapy for RA. The 
background therapy varied among the combination studies and included MTX, a combination of MTX with other 
DMADRs e.g. leflunomide, sulfasalazine and hydrochloroquine or non-MTX DMADRs. The majority of patients in 
the combination therapy studies received MTX with or without other DMARDs as background therapy, only a 
small proportion of patients received concomitant “non-MTX DMARDS”.  
The patients demographic and baseline characteristics were summarised in the efficacy section. Briefly, in all 
populations (placebo-controlled, sarilumab+DMARD long-term safety, and monotherapy) the majority of 
patients were female and Caucasian with a mean age of ~52 years. Prior biologic DMARD use was reported in 
8.4% of patients in the monotherapy population, compared to 43% and 39% of patients in the 
placebo-controlled and sarilumab+DMARD long term safety populations, respectively.

Those events with overall frequency ≥2% in any treatment group and for which there was a numerically higher 
incidence in both sarilumab groups compared to placebo were considered ADRs.  Adverse events which met 
these criteria were infections (ie, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection and nasopharyngitis), 
the IL-6 associated laboratory changes (neutropenia, hypertriglyceridemia, ALT increased), and injection site

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The most frequent SAEs in the sarilumab + DMARD treatment groups were those associated with IL-6 blockade, 
specifically infections and laboratory abnormalities (changes in ANC and ALT). The exposure-adjusted SAE rate 
did not increase over time in the sarilumab+DMARD long-term safety population (Pool 2). Infections remained 
the most frequent SAEs. 
As of the data extraction dates (25 January 2016 for the sarilumab+DMARD population and 17 February 2016 
for the sarilumab monotherapy population), a total of 27 deaths were reported in the patients receiving 
sarilumab in the Phase 2/3 RA clinical studies, including 3 deaths in the sarilumab monotherapy population.  The 
most common causes of death were CV, infections, and malignancies.  The exposure-adjusted rate of death did 
not increase over time in the sarilumab+DMARD long-term safety population. 
Adverse events of special interest  
Specific adverse events, referred to as adverse events of special interest (AESIs), are analysed. These AESIs 
were selected based on the biologic activity of IL-6 and the associated effects of IL-6 inhibition, as well as the 
safety profile of other biologics used in the treatment of RA. The AESIs consistent with IL-6 blockade and 
potential clinical outcomes were: infections particularly serious and opportunistic infections), neutropenia with 
or without infection, thrombocytopenia with or without bleeding, elevations in hepatic transaminases with or 
without hepatic impairment, elevations in lipids, and cardiovascular outcomes or pancreatitis. The AESIs based 
on the safety profiles of other biologic treatments for RA were: events of GI perforation (observed in clinical 
trials of tocilizumab, primarily as complications of diverticulitis in RA patients), malignancy, autoimmunity and 
lupus-like syndrome (observed with TNF antagonists), demyelinating disorders (observed with TNF 
antagonists). The AESIs based on safety findings observed with other subcutaneously administered protein

based therapeutics were: injection site reactions, hypersensitivity (particularly anaphylaxis) and 
immunogenicity.  
Infections were the most common AEs across treatment groups, and occurred more frequently with 
sarilumab+DMARD compared to placebo+DMARD. During the entire treatment period in the placebo-controlled 
population, the rate of infections in the 200 mg q2w and 150 mg q2w sarilumab groups was 84.5 and 81.0 
events/100 patient-years, resp., compared to 75.1 events/100 patient-years in the placebo group. The most 
commonly reported infections (5% to 7% of patients) were upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract 
infections, and nasopharyngitis. The rate of serious infections in the entire placebo controlled population in the 
200 mg q2w and 150 mg q2w sarilumab groups was 4.3 events (95% CI: 2.59, 6.72) and 3.0 events/100 
patient-years (95% CI: 1.57, 5.04), resp. compared to 3.1 events/100 patient-years (95% CI: 1.62, 5.48) in 
the placebo group. The rate of infections (57.3 events/100 patient-years) and serious infections (3.4 events/100 
patient-years) with sarilumab+DMARD in the long-term safety population was consistent with rates in the 
controlled periods of the studies. The rates of any infection and discontinuation due to infection were similar 
between both doses of sarilumab. There was a numeric difference in the incidence of serious infections between 
the 200 mg q2w and 150 mg q2w sarilumab treatment groups (1.1%) but the 95% CI for the rate difference 
included zero (95% CI: -0.6, 2.7). While a statistical difference between doses was not detected, based on the 
95% CI, if a difference does exist it is likely to be small (<3%). Exposure-adjusted rate of serious infection (95% 
CI) by 6-month intervals during the entire TEAE period was provided for sarilumab+DMARD long-term safety 
population, the rate was constant over time.  
There were 6 patients who had a fatal infection in sarilumab+DMARD long-term safety population, with 5 
patients on 200 mg q2w and 1 patient on 150 mg q2w at the time of the fatal event. In addition, there were 4 
reports of non-fatal sepsis or septic shock, of which 1 occurred in EFC11072 and the remaining occurred in 
LTS11210. All of these patients were on 200 mg q2w.  
Absolute neutrophil and leukocyte counts over time ranged widely and were fluctuating. Neutrophil count was in 
general above the threshold 1.5 G/L for Grade 1 neutropenia (one patient at a single timepoint a marked 
reduced leucite and neutrophil count). The last neutrophil counts prior to onset of events were all above 1.5 G/L. 
In most case (7/10) the event occurred less than 12 days after the last sarilumab dose. Evaluation of 
exposure-adjusted rate of all infections shows that the event rate was highest in the first 6 months followed by 
a continued decrease stabilising on a low level until Month 60, after which there fewer data available are limiting 
the assessment.  
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of infections in the monotherapy population (59.0/100 patient-years) was 
generally similar to the concomitant DMARD populations with the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of serious 
infections slightly lower in the monotherapy population (1.3/100 patient-years). The most frequent infections, 
occurring in at least 2% of patients receiving sarilumab monotherapy, were nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infections. Six patients developed herpes zoster that required 
hospitalization and herpes zoster was the AE by PT that more frequently led to permanent treatment 
discontinuation (0.5%). Moreover, herpes zoster was the only OI reported also in the monotherapy population, 
although only in two patients. 
Opportunistic infections (OIs) were reported both in pool 1 and pool 2 populations with Herpes zoster being the 
most represented event (0.7 events/100 PYs in long-term population).  Data on OIs by subgroups of use of 
corticosteroids at baseline, previous biologic DMARD use and lowest absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at any time 
in the study have been provided. 
Assessment report

Page 163/189 
  
  
Data provided from pool 1 do not allow drawing firm conclusion due to the very small number of patients 
developing OIs in this safety population. 
In the long-term safety population (pool 2), 54 patients experienced OIs and the incidence of OIs was 
numerically higher in patients with prior baseline steroid use in the sarilumab any dose group (2.1% in patients 
with baseline steroid use vs.1.6% in patients with no baseline steroid use). However, data coming from an 
additional analysis by calculating exposure adjusted event rates of OI in pool 2, showed that the 
exposure-adjusted event rate of OIs in patients with baseline corticosteroid use in sarilumab+DMARD group 
[1.0/100 patient-year (PY)s] appears to be quite similar to the exposure-adjusted event rate of OIs in the group 
of patients with no baseline corticosteroid use (0.9/100 PYs). A less clear pattern was observed in patients with 
prior biologic DMARD use both in pool 1 and pool 2. Regarding the incidence of OIs by lowest ANC, a clear 
association between Grade 3-4 neutropenia and an increased risk of OIs was not possible to identify. In the 
placebo-controlled population, no patients with an ANC <1.0 Giga/L experienced an opportunistic infection. In 
the long-term safety population, of the 340 patients with an ANC <1.0, only 3 patients had an opportunistic 
infection and 1 of these had an opportunistic infection that was concurrent with ANC <1.0.  
Mean baseline ANC in the 52-week placebo-controlled population (Pool 1) was at the upper end of the normal 
range. Mean decreases in ANC were observed in the sarilumab + DMARD groups (Pool 2), although the mean 
values remained within the normal range; ANC values remained at the upper end of the normal range in the 
placebo + DMARD group. The decrease in ANC reached a plateau at Week 4 and was stable thereafter. In the 
monotherapy population (Pool 3) a decrease in ANC was observed, which was transient for most patients. 
Baseline platelet counts in the placebo-controlled population (Pool 1) were at the upper end of the normal range. 
A mean decrease from baseline in platelet count was observed in the sarilumab + DMARD groups (Pool 2), 
although mean values remained in the normal range. Platelet counts in the placebo group remained at the upper 
end of the normal range. The decrease in platelet count reached a plateau at Week 4 and was stable thereafter. 
Mean increases in ALT and AST were observed in the sarilumab treatment groups (Pool 1 and Pool 2) compared 
to the placebo group. On average, an increase was observed at 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Changes in 
liver enzymes reached a plateau at Week 4 and were stable thereafter.  
Lipid parameters (LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) were first assessed at 4 weeks following initiation of sarilumab in 
the placebo-controlled population (Pool 1). In the sarilumab + DMARD groups at Week 4, the mean LDL 
increased by ~14 mg/dL; mean triglycerides increased by ~23 mg/dL; and mean HDL increased by ~3 mg/dL. 
After Week 4, no additional increase was observed. In the long-term safety population, the differences from 
baseline in lipid parameters were consistent with what was observed in the placebo-controlled clinical trials. 
There were no reports of pancreatitis secondary to increase in triglycerides. The observed rate of confirmed 
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was low.  
In the placebo-controlled population (Pool 1), at baseline, the mean creatinine (Cr) was 65.18-66.14 umol/L 
(0.74-0.75 mg/dL) [normal range: 35.36 -97.24 umol/L (0.40-1.10 mg/dL)]. In the patients on sarilumab, an 
initial increase in serum Cr was observed which plateaued after Week 24 with a mean Cr of ~70 umol/L (~0.79 
mg/dL) [normal range: 35.36-97.24 umol/L (0.40-1.10 mg/dL)]. 
A total of 8 patients on sarilumab+DMARD had either complicated diverticulitis or GI perforation not secondary 
to surgical complication. All but 1 patient were on concomitant NSAIDs (including low dose aspirin) or steroids. 
No events occurred in a patient on placebo. 
In the placebo-controlled population, the exposure adjusted rate of malignancies was similar in both sarilumab 
+ DMARD q2w groups (0.9 and 1.1 events/100 patient years, respectively) and placebo + DMARD groups (1.0

event/100 patient years). The rates were similar in the long-term safety population (0.8 events/100 patient 
years [95% CI: 0.55, 1.01]). Based on standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) using the SEER database (1.16 
events/100 patient-years) (Howlader N et al: SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2013, National Cancer 
Institute. Bethesda, MD, http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2013/, based on November 2015 SEER data 
submission, posted to the SEER web site, April 2016), an increased rate of malignancy was not observed in 
patients receiving sarilumab compared to the general population or patients with RA. 
The incidence of ANA positivity was similar between sarilumab groups and placebo groups and only few patients 
developed positivity to anti-ds DNA antibodies. 4 adverse events of cutaneous lupus were reported in the 
long-term safety population, but there were no events suggestive of Lupus-like disorders. There was no 
evidence that sarilumab treatment was associated with lupus-like syndrome. 
Two cases suggestive of demyelinating disorders were identified in patients receiving sarilumab with 
concomitant DMARDs: one case of transverse myelitis occurred 7 months post-study in which the assessment of 
a causal relationship with the study drug was confounded by prior and concomitant use of anti-TNFs, and one 
case reported as Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) for which a definitive diagnosis of MMN and/or a causal 
relation with sarilumab, have not been confirmed by the Applicant. 
A higher incidence of injection site reactions were observed in sarilumab treatment groups compared to placebo, 
the reactions were mild in severity for the majority (90.6%) of patients. 
No cases of severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis were observed in the placebo-controlled 
population or in the long-term safety population before the cut-off date for the CTD.  
Comparison of sarilumab and tocilizumab 
The sarilumab clinical development program included 2 studies with sarilumab SC and the marketed IL-6 
inhibitor tocilizumab IV, both in patients receiving concomitant MTX. One study (6R88-RA-1309) was a 
single-dose study with the primary objective of assessing PD parameters (including ANC) and the other study 
(SFY13370) was a 24-week safety calibrator study.  
Among the PD parameters in Study 6R88-RA-1309, ANC was also considered a safety parameter. The mean 
change and mean percent change from baseline in ANC values were similar across treatment groups for the first 
week of the study. The return of ANC values to baseline values was the main difference observed between the 
sarilumab and tocilizumab treatment groups. The timing of the trend for return to baseline was consistent with 
the dosing interval for both sarilumab (q2w) and tocilizumab (q4w). 
With regard to other safety parameters no clinically meaningful differences were observed between sarilumab 
and tocilizumab in either of these studies. 
Comparison of sarilumab and adalimumab  
The  EFC14092  study  compared  sarilumab  200  mg  q2w  to  adalimumab  40  mg  q2w  administered  as 
monotherapy. Safety data for patients who received sarilumab in the study were included in the monotherapy 
population described previously. 
Infections were the most frequent TEAE by SOC and occurred in at a similar frequency in the adalimumab and 
sarilumab groups (27.7% and 28.8%, respectively). The incidence of neutropenia was higher in the sarilumab 
group than in the adalimumab group (13.6% compared to 0.5%, respectively), although the rate of infections, 
including  serious  and  opportunistic  infections  was  similar  in  the  2  groups.  Injection  site  erythema  was  also 
observed more frequently in the sarilumab group (7.6% compared to 3.3% in the adalimumab group). TEAEs of 
headache and rheumatoid arthritis were among the AEs reported more frequently in the adalimumab group

(6.5%  and  3.8%,  respectively,  in  the  adalimumab  group  compared  to  3.9%  and  0.5%,  respectively,  in  the 
sarilumab group). 
Mean decreases in ANC and platelet count and mean increases in ALT, and LDL were observed in the sarilumab 
group compared to the adalimumab group, with all mean values remaining in the normal range. No increased 
incidence of infection overall, serious infection or opportunistic infection was observed. 
Immunological events 
Pool 1 
In placebo-controlled population ADA were positive in 14% of patients in sarilumab 200 mg q2w group, 19.3% 
in sarilumab 150 mg q2w group and 3.5% in placebo group. 1.8%, 3.3% and 0.2% of patients respectively, 
were positive for neutralizing antibodies. The majority of positive responses in the ADA assay were transient and 
the median titer was ≤60; the lowest titer is 30. 
Pool 2 
The  percentage  of  patients  positive  in  the  ADA  assay  in  the  long-term  safety  population  was  17.1%  with  a 
median titer of 30.

Laboratory findings 
In the sarilumab+DMARD long-term safety population (Pool 2), a total of 14 patients reported an adverse event 
in the HLT Renal failure and Impairment with reported PTs of acute kidney injury (4 patients), renal failure (4 
patients), renal impairment (3 patients), chronic kidney disease (2 patients), and pre-renal failure (1 patient). 
In the monotherapy pool (Pool 3) 2 patients reported an adverse event in the HLT Renal failure and impairment.  
In 14 patients with reported PT of acute kidney injury, pre-renal failure, renal impairment, or renal failure, there 
were concurrent illnesses (e.g., infection, dehydration due to hyperglycemia) which could have attribute to the 
renal failure. Two additional cases were reported during the evaluation procedure. These patients did not have 
a concurrent illness. In one of these patients concomitant medications included those with potential renal side 
effects (MTX, NSAID, diuretic and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor). In the other patient without a 
concurrent illness, laboratory values were in the normal range (Cr, CrCl, and BUN) with urinalysis showing trace 
protein. Concurrent disease and concomitant medications provide alternative explanation for the events. 
A low incidence of lymphopenia was reported. No adverse events related to other specific white cell types were 
observed.See also adverse events of special interest.  
Data  about  Immunoglobulins  titers  were  not  collected  during  the  clinical  development  program.  In  order  to 
identify  the  occurrence  of  those  infections  more  commonly  associated  to  humoral  immunodeficiency  in 
sarilumab  treated  subjects,  a  table  reporting  events  of  bacterial  upper  respiratory  tract  and  pulmonary 
infections in placebo-controlled safety population (pool 1) has been provided (see table below).

Studies  have  not  been  conducted  in  pregnant  and  lactating  women  on  sarilumab.  The  clinical  development 
program excluded enrolment of pregnant or breast feeding women and sexually active women of childbearing 
potential  were  required  to  practice  adequate  contraception  during  the  study.  Per  protocol,  IMP  was  to  be 
discontinued in female participants who became pregnant.  
In the sarilumab+DMARD long-term safety population, there were 13 patients who became pregnant and 2 male 
patients  whose  partner  became  pregnant.  Of  these  13  patients  who  became  pregnant  seven  women  had 
miscarriage (i.e., spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, imminent abortion, blighted ovum); 1 occurred early 
in the second trimester and the rest occurred during the first trimester. 
Both pregnant partners of male sarilumab patients delivered a healthy child.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
A specific clinical pharmacology study to assess the effect of sarilumab on simvastatin, a sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate, was conducted in patients with RA.  Exposure of simvastatin decreased by 45% when administered to 
patients with RA as a single 40 mg oral dose, 1 week after a single 200 mg SC dose of sarilumab. These 
reductions in the exposure of simvastatin suggest that sarilumab may reverse IL-6 mediated suppression of 
CYP3A4 activity in patients with active RA. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the placebo-controlled population (Pool 1), during the entire treatment period, a higher incidence of TEAEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation was reported in the sarilumab treatment groups compared to placebo. In 
the  placebo-controlled  population  (Pool  1),  during  the  entire  treatment  period,  a  higher  incidence  of  TEAEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation was reported in the sarilumab treatment groups compared to placebo. The 
SOCs in which TEAEs were most frequently reported as leading to treatment discontinuation for sarilumab (both 
doses) were Infections and infestations; Blood and lymphatic system disorders; and Investigations. The most 
frequently reported PTs were neutropenia, ALT increased and herpes zoster. 
The  exposure-adjusted  discontinuation  rate  did  not  increase  in  the  sarilumab+DMARD  long-term  safety 
population (Pool 2). Neutropenia, increased ALT, and herpes zoster remained the most frequent TEAEs leading 
to  discontinuation.  Prior  to  the  implementation  of  the  above-mentioned  protocol  amendment  in  LTS11210, 
herpes zoster was specified as an opportunistic infection that should lead to treatment discontinuation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 169/189 
  
  
 
 
In the monotherapy pool (Pool 3) highest incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events occurred during the 
first 12 weeks of sarilumab monotherapy. The SOCs in which TEAEs were most frequently reported as leading to 
treatment discontinuation, in decreasing frequency, were Blood and lymphatic system disorders; Infections and 
infestations; and General disorders and administrative conditions. The most frequently reported PTs (for the 
monotherapy population defined as occurring in 2 or more patients) were neutropenia, herpes zoster, and ALT 
increased, although ALT increased leading to treatment discontinuation occurred less frequently in the 
monotherapy population. Rheumatoid arthritis and injection site erythema leading to treatment discontinuation 
also occurred in 2 or more patients in the monotherapy population. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 3354 patients have received at least 1 dose of sarilumab±DMARD in the global Phase 2 and 3 RA 
clinical development program are included in the integrated safety analysis.  
In all Phase 2/3 studies (except monotherapy studies) patients received background therapy for RA. In several 
studies the patients received MTX while in other studies permitted background therapy also includes one or a 
combination of e.g. MTX, leflunomide, sulfasalazine and hydrochloroquine). The Applicant submitted an analysis 
for any TEAE, any infection, serious TEAE, and discontinuation due to any adverse event (AE) in the placebo 
controlled safety population (Pool 1) and for the population that received MTX concomitantly either alone or in 
combination  with  other  non-biologic  DMARDs  and  those  that  were  non-MTX-treated  in  the  long-term  safety 
population (Pool 2). The majority of the patients received an MTX based background therapy. No differences 
between the MTX and non-MTX based background regimen were observed. The new analyses provided by the 
Applicant  do  not  fully  address  the  concern;  it  would  have  been  of  interest  to  analyse  at  least  MTX  vs. 
MTX+DMARDs background therapy. However given the benign safety profile of the treatment further analysis of 
the data deems not of added value. 
Demographic  and  baseline  patient  characteristics  in  the  placebo-controlled  population  were  well-balanced 
among the three treatment groups. Baseline RA characteristics were generally similar between all populations 
studied and between treatment groups. 
An overview of the incidence and exposure –adjusted incidence rate for was provided of TEAEs, serious TEAES, 
TEAEs  leading  to  death  and  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  were  provided  for  the  different 
population pools.  
Based  on  exposure-adjusted 
incidence  rates,  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  between 
the 
sarilumab+DMARD  long-term  safety  population  (Pool  2)  and  the  placebo-controlled  population  (Pool  1)  was 
observed. In the Pool 2 population the exposure adjusted incidence rates of TEAEs, SAEs, and discontinuations 
due  to  TEAE  were  generally  similar  or  slightly  lower  than  the  rates  observed  in  the  placebo-controlled 
population.  The  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  for  death  was  similar  to  the  rate  observed  in  the 
placebo-controlled population. 
The majority of patients in the sarilumab monotherapy population any dose group reported at least 1 TEAE 
during  the  treatment-emergent  period.  The  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  of  TEAEs  in  the  sarilumab 
monotherapy group was consistent with what was observed in the sarilumab+DMARD placebo-controlled and 
long-term safety populations. The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of SAEs and discontinuations due to TEAEs 
were slightly numerically lower in the monotherapy population than in the sarilumab+DMARD populations and 
were generally consistent with the rates observed in the placebo+DMARD group. This is not unexpected since 
the safety profile of sarilumab might be biased to some extent by the concomitant medication i.e. DMARDs. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 170/189 
  
  
exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  of  TEAEs  leading  to  death  in  the  sarilumab  monotherapy  population  was 
consistent with what was observed in the concomitant DMARD populations. 
However, the events were not reported broken down to the dose e.g. the data are reported for the entire Pool 
2  but  not  according  the  two  different  dose  groups  Analyses  for  the  sarilumab  +  DMARD  long-term  safety 
population (Pool 2) were performed on the sarilumab 150 mg and 200 mg q2w initial dose groups and the “any 
dose group”. To supplement these data the Applicant reviewed the data for the non-selected dose groups. There 
were 364 patients exposed to at least 1 dose of a sarilumab non-selected dose regimen (i.e., 100 mg once in 2 
weeks [q2w], 100 mg every week [qw], or 150 mg qw). The contribution of the 100 mg q2w and 100 mg qw 
doses is limited in both the number of patients and the follow-up time. The 150 mg qw dose group contributed 
the most data to the data among the non-selected dose. Although the data on the 150 mg qw dose group is 
limited relative to the data available on the selected doses, the type of events observed were consistent with 
effects of IL-6 inhibition and subcutaneous route of administration and with the overall safety database. 
An analysis of the exposure adjusted-rate of TEAEs by 6-month intervals during the entire TEAE period and an 
exposure-adjusted rate of TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation by 6-month intervals during the entire 
TEAE period was submitted. The analysis of the exposure adjusted TEAE rate showed that the event rate was 
highest in the first 6 month with a continuous decline thereafter.  Similar the exposure-adjusted rate of TEAEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation showed that the event rate was highest in the first 6 months followed by 
a continued decrease stabilising on a low level. 
In the placebo controlled population (Pool 1) the most frequent TEAEs were infection and infestation, a higher 
incidence was observed in sarilumab + DMARD group compared to the placebo +DMARD group. In general those 
TEAEs associated with IL-6 blockade, specifically infection, and laboratory abnormalities occurred at a higher 
incidence in either sarilumab + DMARD group compared to the placebo + DMARD group. A numerically higher 
incidence of TEAEs was observed in the 200 mg q2w group compared to the 150 mg q2w group, primarily due 
to a higher incidence of neutropenia and leukopenia.  
In  the  monotherapy  population  (Pool  3)  the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  were  infections  and 
infestations,  followed  by  neutropenia,  injection  site  erythema,  and  nasopharyngitis.  Consistent  with 
administration  in  the  absence  of  MTX  or  other  DMARDs,  which  have  the  potential  for  hepatotoxicity,  the 
monotherapy  population  had  a  lower  occurrence  of  ALT  increased  compared  to  the  sarilumab+DMARD 
population; the exposure-adjusted event rate for ALT increased was comparable to the placebo+DMARD group 
in the placebo-controlled population. 
Safety data in bDMARDs-Inadequate Responders (IR) subjects from sarilumab monotherapy population (pool 3) 
have been provided. There were very few subjects in pool 3 (7 and 5 patients in the 150 mg and 200 mg q2w 
initial dose groups, respectively) who discontinued prior biologic DMARD. The majority of patients in any dose 
treatment experienced TEAEs [9 subjects (75%)]. Infections were reported in 33.3% of patients and only 1 
patient had a serious TEAE. Among AEs of special interest (AESIs), infections and injection site reactions were 
the most represented (33.3% and 25%, respectively). 
The applicant selected placebo-controlled population as most appropriate population for identification of 
common AEs. However this population provides only data up to 52 weeks of treatment. An analysis of Pool 2 
should allow analysis of the long-term profile up to 5 years. The applicant was requested to provide the AE 
profile for Pool 2, including an evaluation over time.  The Applicant supplement the data submitted with the MAA 
i.e. AESIs, and time course of discontinuations for AEs for Pool 2 by an analysis of the exposure adjusted-rate of 
TEAEs by 6-month intervals during the entire TEAE period and an exposure-adjusted rate of TEAEs leading to 
permanent discontinuation by 6-month intervals during the entire TEAE period. 
Assessment report

The analysis of the exposure adjusted TEAE rate showed that the event rate was highest in the first 6 month with 
a continuous decline thereafter.  
Similar the exposure-adjusted rate of TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation showed that the event rate 
was highest in the first 6 months followed by a continued decrease stabilising on a low level.  
In the sarilumab+DMARD long-term safety population (Pool 2), a total of 14 patients reported an adverse event 
in the HLT Renal failure and Impairment with reported PTs of acute kidney injury (4 patients), renal failure (4 
patients), renal impairment (3 patients), chronic kidney disease (2 patients), and pre-renal failure (1 patient). 
In the monotherapy pool (Pool 3) 2 patients reported an adverse event in the HLT Renal failure and impairment. 
In 14 patients with reported PT of acute kidney injury, pre-renal failure, renal impairment, or renal failure, there 
were concurrent illnesses (e.g., infection, dehydration due to hyperglycemia) which could have attribute to the 
renal failure. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) based on the biologic activity of IL-6 were reported separately. 
Infections  were  the  most  common  AESIs  across  treatment  groups,  and  occurred  more  frequently  with 
sarilumab+DMARD compared to placebo+DMARD.  
Absolute neutrophil and leukocyte counts over time ranged widely and were fluctuating. Neutrophil count was in 
general  above  the  threshold  1.5  G/L  for  Grade  1  neutropenia  (one  patient  at  a  single  timepoint  a  marked 
reduced leucite and neutrophil count). The last neutrophil counts prior to onset of events were all above 1.5 G/L. 
However  the  neutrophil  count  was  in  all  cases  either  prior  to  the  sarilumab  dose  or  at  the  timepoint  of  the 
dosage. In most case (7/10) the event occurred less than 12 days after the last sarilumab dose. Both events i.e. 
neutropenia and serious infections are known risk of treatment with IL-6 inhibitors and adequately described in 
the SPC. Evaluation of exposure-adjusted rate of all infections shows that the event rate was highest in the first 
6 months followed by a continued decrease stabilising on a low level until Month 60, after which there fewer data 
available are limiting the assessment. Thus the data do not suggest an increased incidence of infection over 
time.  
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of infections in the monotherapy population was generally similar to the 
concomitant DMARD populations with the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of serious infections slightly lower in 
the monotherapy population. The observed rates are consistent with the general RA population (Tran TN et al: 
Incidence  density  of  serious  infection,  opportunistic  infection,  and  tuberculosis  associated  with  biologic 
treatment  in  patients  with  rheumatoid  arthritis  –  a  systematic  evaluation  of  the  literature.  Open  Access 
Rheumatology: Research and Reviews. 2013;5:21-32).  
Exposure-adjusted rate of serious infection by 6-month intervals during the entire TEAE period was provided for 
sarilumab+DMARD long-term safety population, however not for all infections. The applicant provided such 
analysis all infections. Evaluation of exposure-adjusted rate of all infections shows that the event rate was 
highest in the first 6 months followed by a continued decrease stabilising on a low level until Month 60, after 
which there fewer data available are limiting the assessment. Thus the data do not suggest an increased 
incidence of infection over time.  
Consistent with the presence of a chronic inflammatory condition, mean baseline ANC and platelet counts were 
at  the  upper  end  of  the  normal  range  at  baseline.  A  decrease  of  the  values  was  observed  in  all  sarilumab 
treatment groups. However the mean values remained within the normal range. The decrease in ANC reached 
a  plateau  at  Week  4  and  was  stable  thereafter.  No  meaningful  differences  were  observed  between  the  two 
sarilumab dose groups. Due to previous experience with tocilizumab, patients with platelet counts <150 Giga/L 
were  not  included  in  the  sarilumab  clinical  trials,  therefore  similarly  to  what  required  for  ANC  decrease,  a

warning recommending to not initiate sarilumab in patients with platelet counts <150 X103/µl has been added 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Data about Immunoglobulins titers were not collected during the clinical development program. Clinical data 
provided seem to not identify a clear difference in the incidence of bacterial infections between sarilumab and 
placebo arms. Moreover, taking into account the role of IL-6 in inducing B cells differentiation and data coming 
from  non-clinical  animal  studies  reporting  reversible  changes  in  IgG  responses  and  concentrations,  
“Immunoglobulins levels following sarilumab treatment” has been added to the RMP as missing information. 
Mean increases in ALT and AST  were observed in the sarilumab treatment groups compared to the placebo 
group, with no clinically meaningful differences between doses. Changes in liver enzymes reached a plateau at 
Week 4 and were stable thereafter. No cases of liver enzyme elevations met Hy’s Law criteria. Lower incidence 
of ALT in the sarilumab monotherapy population than in the sarilumab + DMARD population was observed. This 
is not unexpected and can be attributed to the absence of DMARDs. As expected, a better safety profile in terms 
of  transaminases  elevation  was  observed  when  sarilumab  was  administered  as  monotherapy,  due  to  of  the 
absence of the combined effects of MTX or other c-DMARDs on liver functionality. 
Increase in lipid parameters (LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) were observed in the sarilumab + DMARD groups at 
Week  4,  while  the  values  for  placebo  group  patients  remain  largely  constant.  After  Week  4,  no  additional 
increase was observed. In the long-term safety population, the differences from baseline in lipid parameters 
were  consistent  with  what  was  observed  in  the  placebo-controlled  clinical  trials.  There  were  no  reports  of 
pancreatitis secondary to increase in triglycerides. The observed rate of confirmed major adverse cardiovascular 
events  (MACE)  was  low.  Consistent  with  the  data  of  the  sarilumab  +  DMARDs  population,  a  increase  from 
baseline in LDL, HDL, and triglycerides was observed at 4 weeks after initiation of sarilumab in the monotherapy 
population (Pool 3). However mean values remained in the normal range. None of these patients experienced 
pancreatitis. 
The exposure adjusted rate of malignancies was similar in Pool 1 for both sarilumab + DMARD q2w groups and 
placebo + DMARD groups. The rates in the long-term safety population were consistent with this finding. An 
increased  rate  of  malignancy  was  not  observed  in  patients  receiving  sarilumab  compared  to  the  general 
population or patients with RA (Howlader N et al: SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2013, National Cancer 
Institute.  Bethesda,  MD,  http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2013/,  based  on  November  2015  SEER  data 
submission, posted to the SEER web site, April 2016.). 
From available data, there was no evidence that sarilumab treatment was associated with lupus-like syndrome 
or demyelinating disorder. 
The safety profile of sarilumab in monotherapy was generally consistent with the safety profile of sarilumab with 
concomitant  DMARDs.  The  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  of  SAEs  and  of  TEAEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuations were slightly lower in the monotherapy population than in the sarilumab concomitant DMARD 
populations  and  similar  to  the  placebo+DMARD  group.  Also  consistent  with  what  was  observed  in  the 
concomitant DMARD populations, few fatal events were reported. 
Overall, regarding the sarilumab safety profile of monotherapy population in bDMARDs-Inadequate Responders 
(IR) subjects, no firm conclusion can be drawn due to the very limited number of subjects (12 subjects in total). 
However, safety profile is not expected to be worse when sarilumab is used as monotherapy compared to MTX 
combination therapy in this subpopulation. 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed with regard to safety between sarilumab and tocilizumab in 
either of these studies performed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 173/189 
  
  
Comparable safety profiles of sarilumab and adalimumab were observed with differences primarily due to the 
anticipated laboratory changes associated with IL-6 inhibition, i.e. a higher incidence of patients with decreased 
ANC and neutropenia which was not associated with infection. 
The Applicant was required to provide data on immunogenicity, including the impact on efficacy and safety, 
according to 1% error rate confirmatory cut point. Overall, data provided did not show important differences in 
lack and loss of efficacy between all patients who were ADA positive (3.8% and 1.7%, respectively) and those 
who were ADA negative (3.4% and 1.5%). With regard to safety, the incidence rate of hypersensitivity reactions 
analyzed with the 1% error rate were similar in ADA positive (6.5%) or negative (9.4%) patients, as previously 
observed with the 0.1% error rate. 
In the sarilumab+DMARD long-term safety population, there were 13 patients who became pregnant. Of these 
women 7 patients had a miscarriage. The Applicant provided data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. 
Data on women with RA were collected with regard to the risk of pregnancy loss, including early miscarriages 
(before gestational Week 12), late miscarriages (Weeks 12–22), and stillbirths (Wallenius et al 2015). Further 
data from Roche database on women who  were exposed to tocilizumab shortly before or during pregnancy, 
pregnancy  outcomes  (Hoeltzenbein  2016)  were  discussed.  The  data  suggest  a  relative  high  incidence  of 
miscarriage in the RA population compared to the general population.  
The Applicant will participate in the North America pregnancy registry (OTIS) to evaluate the risk of birth defects 
and other pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to sarilumab during pregnancy in real-world clinical setting 
(see below section RMP) to address this missing information. 
No studies in paediatric patients, elderly patients, renal impaired patients or hepatic impaired patients were 
conducted. Only 14% of patients were older than 65 years. In total, age ranged from 18 – 88 years. This has 
been adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
Patients with known HIV infection as well as patients infected with Hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C were excluded 
from the study. This has been adequately reflected reflected in the SmPC and the RMP. 
The effect of sarilumab on CYP enzymes may be clinically relevant for a CYP substrate with narrow therapeutic 
index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of sarilumab in patients being 
treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of effects (e.g., for warfarin) or drug 
concentration (e.g., for theophylline) should be performed, and the individual dose of the medicinal product 
should be adjusted as needed. Caution should be exercised when sarilumab is co-administered with CYP3A4 
substrates (e.g. oral contraceptives or statins) as there may be a reduction in exposure which may reduce the 
effectiveness of the CYP3A4 substrate.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety observation is based on a total of 3354 patients exposed to at least 1 dose of sarilumab for a total of 
5981.0  patient-years  of  exposure.  Sarilumab  is  associated  with  infections  (including  serious  infections), 
decrease in ANC and platelet count, and increase in ALT and lipids, all of which are events consistent with the 
known effect of IL-6 inhibition, and with injection site reactions, consistent with a SC route of administration. No 
new safety concerns were identified during the development program in the clinical trial population.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.2 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that sarilumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European 
Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers sarilumab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet does not entirely meet the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.  
The applicant’s response package has not addressed all aspects adequately as requested, in particular related to 
the mock-ups.  
However, the readability test is be considered acceptable with the applicant’s commitment to perform a new 
reduced testing with the adopted version of the package leaflet within the next upcoming variation impacting the 
content of the PL/IFU. The abridged testing should be carried out with ten participants and should cover all QRD 
aspects as previously mentioned.

2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kevzara (sarilumab) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially claimed indication was: “Kevzara is indicated in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs) or as monotherapy for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
in adult patients who responded inadequately or were intolerant to DMARDs or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) 
antagonists. Kevzara has been shown to inhibit progression of joint damage and to improve physical function”. 
The final approved indication is: 
“Kevzara in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active 
rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more 
disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs. Kevzara can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or 
when treatment with MTX is inappropriate (see section 5.1)”. 
Treatment of the disease is aimed at: the amelioration of signs and symptoms and disease activity (including 
remission), improvement in physical function and prevention of the progression of structural damage.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Available therapies consist of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (c-DMARDs). Among these, 
methotrexate,  leflunomide,  sulfasalazine,  and  hydroxychloroquine,  are  the  first  line  of  therapy  for  RA, 
methotrexate  (MTX)  being  the  preferred  option  in  either  DMARD-naïve  early  RA  (<6  months  duration)  or 
established RA.  
Biologic  DMARDs  (b-DMARDs)  including  tumour  necrosis  factor  inhibitors  (etanercept,  infliximab,  and 
adalimumab)  and  other  classes  of  biologics  (eg,  antagonists  or  inhibitors  of  IL-1,  IL-6,  CD20,  or  T-cell 
activation), are used either in combination with c-DMARDs or as monotherapy.  
A substantial number of patients fail to achieve RA treatment goals with current therapies, and there remains a 
continuing unmet medical need for an alternative and effective therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 178/189 
  
  
 
Indeed,  ~66%  of  DMARD-naïve  patients  with  RA  have  been  reported  to  discontinue  MTX  after  2  years  of 
treatment  due  to  insufficient  response  or  toxicity  (van  der  Kooij  SM  et  al,    Ann  Rheum  Dis.  2007  Oct; 
66(10):1356-62). A substantial proportion of patients (between 30% and 40%) fail to respond to or become 
intolerant of anti-TNF-α therapies (Smolen & Aletaha, Nat Rev Rheumatol. 2015 May;11(5):276-89).  
There is some evidence that suggests these patients may ultimately derive clinical benefit when they switch to 
a mechanistically different drug. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Sarilumab in add on to MTX/cDMARDs in c-DMARD-IR and b-DMARD-IR subjetcs 
-EFC11072 was an operationally seamless Phase 2/3 study aimed to demonstrate that sarilumab on top of MTX 
is effective on reduction of signs and symptoms RA at 12 weeks and to define the best dose/dosage regimen for 
further  development  (part  A)  and  to  demonstrate  sarilumab  efficacy  in  MTX-IR  patients  (superiority  over 
PLB+MTX of sarilumab 200mgq2w or 150mgq2w).  
Part B is considered a pivotal study for demonstrating efficacy in MTX-IR patients. It is a PLB controlled study 
of 52 weeks, consisting of two cohorts.  Cohort 2 included patients after doses were selected from part A and 
thus having the following arms: sarilumab 150mg q2w+MTX, sarilumab 200mg q2w+MTX and PLB+MTX, which 
is considered the primary population. 
-EFC10832 was a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with a history of TNF-IR. In this 
study, sarilumab or placebo was administered in combination with MTX or other c-DMARDs i.e. sulfasalazine, 
hydroxychloroquine, or leflunomide.   
Sarilumab monotherapy in subjects who responded inadequately or were intolerant to MTX 
EFC14092 was a 2-part study: Part 1 (completed) was a randomized, active-controlled (adalimumab), double 
blind, double-dummy (due to different formulations) 24-week treatment period that enrolled patients who were 
either intolerant of, or considered inappropriate candidates for continued treatment with MTX, or who, after at 
least 12 weeks of continued treatment with MTX, were determined to be inadequate responders.  In Part 2, the 
open-label extension, all patients were to receive sarilumab as monotherapy (ongoing).  
Long-term study. Among others, patients from from EFC11072 and EFC10832 were allowed to enter the 
long-term OL LTS11210 study, an ongoing (cut-off date of 25 January 2016), open-label, uncontrolled 
extension study. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  overall  benefit  is  demonstrated  by  ACR20,  ACR50  and  ACR70  responses.  Favourable  results  were  also 
demonstrated  for  the  secondary  endpoints,  e.g.  individual  ACR  components,  DAS28  and  patient  reported 
outcomes.  
The key favourable effects are: 
• 
Improvement of signs and symptoms: ACR20 response rates in EFC11072 and EFC10832 were better 
for sarilumab compared to placebo 
•  A gain over placebo of 33% and 27% was observed in the first co-primary endpoint, ACR20 response, 
at  week  24,  in  EFC11072  and  EFC10832  studies  respectively,  with  66.4%  and  60.9%  of  patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 179/189 
  
  
obtaining ACR20 response. The amelioration of disease signs and symptoms appeared early than 24 
weeks and, in the EFC11072 study, was maintained up to 52 weeks. 
•  Major clinical response (i.e. achieving and maintaining ACR70 for at least 24 consecutive weeks) shown 
in EFC11072 Part B 
• 
Improvement in physical function: Change from baseline in HAQ-DI in EFC11072 Part B and EFC10832 
was statistically significant for sarilumab compared to placebo 
•  Results  showed  statistically  superiority  of  both  sarilumab  doses,  with  a  slight  larger  gain  in  the 
sarilumab  higher  dose  (-0.58  and  -0.49  for  sarilumab  200 mg  q2w;  -0.54  and  -0.50  for  sarilumab 
150 mg q2w;  and  of  -0.30  and  -0.29  for  placebo).  The  magnitude  of  improvement  in  HAQ-DI  was 
clinically meaningful according to both definitions (>0.22 and >0.3) used in the supportive analyses. 
Maintenance  of  treatment  effect  was  observed  up  to  52  and  24  weeks,  in  EFC11072  and  EFC10832 
studies, respectively 
• 
Improvement  regarding  progression  in  structural  damage  (reduction  of  progression):  change  from 
baseline  in  mTSS  in  EFC11072  Part  B  was  statistically  significant  better  for  sarilumab  compared  to 
placebo. Study results showed superiority of sarilumab+c-DMARD compared to PBL-c-DMARD, with the 
largest  effect  seen  with  the  sarilumab  200mg  q2w  dose  (0.25  for  sarilumab  200  mg  q2w;  0.90  for 
sarilumab 150 q2w, and 2.78 for placebo). Supportive evidence of a positive  sarilumab effect on bone 
damage  is  provided  by  the  greater  (p  <0.0001)  proportion  of  sarilumab-treated  patients  with  no 
progression  of  structural  damage  compared  to  placebo,  as  shown  by  the  conservative  analysis 
evaluating  treatment  effect  on  the  binary  endpoint  progression/no  progression.    The  effect  on 
progressive structural damage was sustained upon continued treatment for up to 3 years.  Of note, the 
evaluation  of  RX  scans  indicated  a  larger  reduction  of  radiographic  progression  in  bone  structural 
damage in subjects initially randomized to sarilumab 200 mg q2w as compared to those who started 
treatment with sarilumab 150 mg q2w. 
• 
In both studies evaluating sarilumab efficacy in combination with c-DMARDs, there was a consistent 
trend favouring the 200mg dose over the 150mg for all explored outcomes, and in particularly for the 
reduction of the rate of bone damage progression. 
•  Superiority  of  sarilumab  to  placebo  (in  EFC11072  and  EFC10832)  regarding  secondary  endpoints 
(ACR50,  ACR70),  all  components  of  ACR  response,  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  a  remission 
(DAS28 remission <2.6), improvement in health status (SF-36 PCS, FACIT-Fatigue) 
•  Maintenance of treatment effect: Improvement of RA-associated signs and symptoms (ACR 20/50/70) 
responses upon prolonged sarilumab administration was observed in the OL Long term LTS11210 study. 
The ACR20 response incidence kept increasing over the time, reaching up to ~90% after 264 weeks of 
treatment in the safety population. Moreover, disease activity as well as physical function supported the 
persistency  of  sarilumab  effect  in  MTX-  and  TNF-IR  patients  (slightly  lower).  Consistent  results  are 
obtained when the two EFC11072 study EFC10832 studies are seen separately, with a predictable trend 
of a lower incidence of response in TNF-IR subjects as compared to MTX-IR ones. 
•  Superiority of sarilumab (200 mg q2w) to adalimumab (40 mg q2w) regarding DAS28-ESR, DAS28-ESR

Posology: There was a consistent trend favouring the 200mg dose over the 150mg for all explored outcomes and 
in particularly for the reduction of the rate of bone damage progression. Of note, in the OL LTS11210 study, 
patients originally randomized to receive sarilumab 150 mg q2w, upon switching to 200 mg q2w, achieved 
nearly comparable responses to those originally randomized to 200 mg q2w, with the exception of treatment 
effect on radiographic progression of bone damage that remained larger in patients originally randomised to 
sarilumab 200 mg q2w both after 2 years (mTSS: 0.23, 200 mg q2w vs. 1.05, 150 mg q2w) and 3 years of 
treatment (mTSS: 0.79, 200 mg q2w vs. 1.87, 150 mg q2w). Maintenance of the treatment effect up to 24 
weeks was seen in subjects who decreased their sarilumab dose from 200 mg q2w to 150 mg qw2. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Sarilumab in add on to MTX/cDMARDs in c-DMARD-IR and b-DMARD-IR subjects 
Given that no active control arm with a b-DMARD was included in the 2 pivotal studies, it is not possible at 
present to contextualise the benefit of sarilumab treatment in the present therapeutic armamentarium available 
for  the  treatment  of  c-DMARD-IR  patients.  Although  superiority  of  sarilumab  doses  was  shown  for  HAQ-DI 
endpoint, some secondary endpoints related to QoL measure were only met by the 150mg q2w sarilumab dose 
in both second line and third line settings. 
Sarilumab monotherapy in bDMARDs-IR subjects 
No efficacy data were available for sarilumab monotherapy in b-DAMRDs-IR patients 
Inconsistency among add-on and monotherapy studies. 
Exposure to sarilumab varies across different groups of body weight (<60 kg, 60 to >100 kg and >100 Kg), 
however,  inconsistent  results  from  add-on  and  monotherapy  efficacy  studies,  probably  due  to  the  limited 
number  of  observations,  do  not  allow  to  clinically  characterize  the  impact  of  BMI≥30  kg/m2  on  sarilumab 
efficacy. 
Posology 
No long-term data on bone damage is available following sarilumab dose reduction. 
Regarding long term study LTS11210: With regard to efficacy the study results have to be interpreted with 
caution as this is an open label trial without internal control. Furthermore, the efficacy analyses do not account 
for dropouts. Thus the efficacy results are likely to be biased 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, a larger number of patients treated with sarilumab (17%-18%) compared to the placebo group (10%) 
discontinued  treatment.  The  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  mostly  adverse  events,  of  which  the  most 
common were neutropenia, elevation of ALT levels and herpes zoster infections.   
Roughly 70% of patients treated with sarilumab in combination with cDMARDs experienced TEAEs compared to 
57% of the placebo+c-DMARD group. The differences between sarilumab in combination with c-DMARDs and 
placebo+c-DMARDs  were  primarily  due  to  differences  in  infections  (about  35%  in  sarilumab+c-DMARDs 
patients,  and  29%  in  placebo+c-DMARDs),  with  a  greater  involvement  of  the upper  respiratory  and  urinary 
tract,  injection  site  erythema  and  pruritus  as  well  as  laboratory  changes  (in  particular  neutropenia, 
hypertriglyceridemia, ALT, or transaminase increased).  
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 181/189 
  
  
Infections and transaminase increase were more specifically related to c-DMARD (mainly MTX) administration, 
whereas neutropenia seems to be more sarilumab-related. However, 6 patients developed herpes zoster that 
required hospitalization. 
Most frequently observed TEAEs and AESI were infections with a higher incidence in the sarilumab group 
Elevations  in  lipids were reported for LDL, HDL and triglycerides during sarilumab treatment. The increase 
occurred in the first 4 weeks and remained stable thereafter. However, the majority of patients did not have a 
shift in NCEP ATPIII and of those patients who did, the majority shifted up 1 level. 
Two  cases  suggestive  of  demyelinating  disorders  were  identified  in  patients  receiving  sarilumab  with 
concomitant DMARDs. 
There was a higher dose dependent (200mg q2w) incidence of neutropenia in the sarilumab group (40.6%) 
compared  to  placebo  (4.9%).  Neutropenia  occurred  generally  early  during  treatment  (first  4  weeks)  with 
sarilumab and then plateaued.  
Higher  dose  dependent  (200mg  q2w)  incidence  of  serious  infections  in  the  sarilumab  group  compared  to 
placebo. 
Gastrointestinal perforations occurred only in the sarilumab group. 
There was a higher incidence of injection site reactions in sarilumab treatment groups compared to placebo 
Hypersensitivity  reactions,  following  sarilumab  sc  injection,  were  principally  of  mild  or  moderate  grade. 
However, serious hypersensitivity events were also observed, although rarely.  
Subgroups analysis showed that elderly patients (≥65 years old) seem to be at higher risk for infections and that 
subjects with a low weight (< 60 Kg) are at higher risk of developing ANC <1.0 Giga/L.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There is uncertainty regarding long-term safety profile of Pool 2. Placebo population only provides AE data up to 
52 weeks of treatment. Although available data do not seem to indicate an increased risk of malignancies and 
MACE  with  sarilumab  long-term  exposure,  only  523  out  of  2887  patients  were  exposed  for  >192  weeks  to 
sarilumab treatment, making difficult to conclusively evaluate the long-term risk of malignancies and MACEs. 
Regarding infections, although a correlation between ANC decrease and infections have not been reported 
during clinical studies, it is difficult to exclude a potential increased risk of infections and serious infections in 
patients with low neutrophil count due to sarilumab treatment. 
In  the  long-term  safety  population  (pool  2),  54  patients  experienced  Opportunistic  infections  and  the 
incidence of OIs was numerically higher in patients with prior baseline steroid use in the sarilumab any dose 
group (2.1% in patients with baseline steroid use vs. 1.6% in patients with no baseline steroid use). However, 
data coming from an additional analysis by calculating exposure adjusted event rates of OI in pool 2, showed 
that the exposure-adjusted event rate of OIs in patients with baseline corticosteroid use in sarilumab+DMARD 
group [1.0/100 patient-year (PY)s] appears to be quite similar to the exposure-adjusted event rate of OIs in the 
group of patients with no baseline corticosteroid use (0.9/100 PYs). A less clear pattern was observed in patients 
with prior biologic DMARD use both in pool 1 and pool 2.  
Taking into account the role of IL-6 in inducing B cells differentiation and data coming from non-clinical animal 
studies reporting reversible changes in IgG responses and concentrations, although the effect of these changes 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 182/189 
  
  
on responses to vaccination was not studied, concerns about patient’s ability to generate a sufficient humoral 
immune response remain.  
From  available  data,  there  was  no  evidence  that  sarilumab  treatment  was  associated  with  demyelinating 
disorder. Two cases suggestive of demyelinating disorders were identified: one case of transverse myelitis 
occurred  7  months  post-study  in  which  the  assessment  of  a  causal  relationship  with  the  study  drug  was 
confounded by prior and concomitant use of anti-TNFs, and one case reported as Multifocal Motor Neuropathy, 
for  which,  however,  a  definitive  diagnosis  of  MMN  and/or  a  causal  relation  with  sarilumab,  have  not  been 
confirmed by the Applicant.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, available evidence supports the benefit of sarilumab in the treatment in moderately to severely active 
RA adult patients who responded inadequately or were intolerant to one or more DMARDs. Treatment effect 
resulted in the amelioration of disease signs and symptoms, improvement of physical function, and reduced 
progression of bone structural damage, the latter effect being demonstrated only in c-DMARD-IR patients in 
combination with MTX. Importantly, treatment effect was maintained over time with a persistent improvement 
of RA-associated signs and symptoms upon prolonged sarilumab administration. The magnitude of the effect is 
overall considered clinically relevant in a patient population for which there still the need for further effective 
alternative treatments. This is particularly true for the c-DMARD-IR patients, where sarilumab monotherapy was 
clearly superior to the anti TNFa drug, adalimumab, on all measured endpoints. Conversely, no efficacy data 
were available for sarilumab monotherapy in RA patients inadequately responders or intolerant to b-DMARD, 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 184/189 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and as such the evidence of benefit of sarilumab treatment as monotherapy was limited to patients intolerant or 
irresponsive to c-DMARDs.  
Rheumatoid arthritis is a heterogenous disease, and even though demographic data may be comparable, 
patients that do not respond adequately to TNF-inhibitors are considered to have a disease that is more difficult 
to treat. 
The fact that the results for monotherapy in the MTX-IR population showed a better trend than combination 
therapy in the TNFi-IR population cannot support a claim that monotherapy would be effective in the latter 
group. Current data does not support RA indication for both monotherapy in bDMARDs-IR patients and 
combination therapy with cDMARDs. 
Unfortunately, no direct comparative data with b-DMARDs have been generated for the combination 
sarilumab+c-DMARD, which is expected to be the most common use of sarilumab in the clinical practice. The full 
appreciation of the relative benefit of sarilumab-cDMARD treatment in the context of the available therapeutic 
scenario was thus hampered. 
A limited number of subjects received other cDMARDs than MTX in the pivotal study where non-MTX DMARDs 
were allowed as background therapy (115 subjects in Study 10832).  CHMP considered that the data was 
therefore too limited to support for a broad indication of conventional DMARDS and that combination therapy 
should not include conventional DMARDs as a group. The different DMARDs are not to be regarded as equivalent, 
neither for mode of action nor in terms of safety. Therefore there is not enough data to support other 
combinations than with MTX. 
Therefore the wording of the indication was changed as recommended by the CHMP and it now read: 
“Kevzara in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active 
rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more 
disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs. Kevzara can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or 
when treatment with MTX is inappropriate (see section 5.1)”. 
Treatment effect appeared to be dose dependent, with a consistent trend favouring the 200mg dose over the 
150mg for all explored outcomes, and in particularly for the reduction of the rate of bone damage progression. 
The sarilumab posology recommended in the proposed SmPC is thus supported by sufficiently clear data. There 
is, however, at present incompletely understanding of the effect of BMI on sarilumab efficacy, as inconsistent 
evidence of a potential decrease of treatment efficacy in patients with BMI≥30 kg/m2 is derived by the pivotal 
studies. It is thus at present not known whether sarilumab dose adjustment is required in patients with BMI≥30 
kg/m2. Patients with a higher body weight (>100kg) are expected to gain a less beneficial therapeutic effect, 
especially when the dose of sarilumab is lowered from 200 mg q2w to 150 mg q2w due to safety reasons. A 
statement regarding possibly impaired efficacy of sarilumab in overweight patients was included in the SmPC. 
The safety profile of sarilumab is principally characterized by the occurrence of: i. hypersensitivity and injection 
site reactions, generally of mild to moderate grade, not requiring discontinuation in the majority of cases, ii. 
infections (including serious and opportunistic infections), and iii. laboratories abnormalities, in particular ANC 
decrease  and  ALT  increase,  without  any  apparent  correlation  between  neutropenia  and  infections.  Both 
neutropenia and ALT elevations appear to be reversible and fairly manageable with dose decrease or treatment 
interruption. Although available data do not seem to indicate an increased risk of malignancies and MACE with 
sarilumab over time, the limited number of patients with long-term exposure prevents any sound conclusion on 
these risks. There is a potential risk of demyelinating disorders that is at present incompletely characterized, 
and also occurrence of gastrointestinal perforations, reported as complications of diverticulitis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 185/189 
  
  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The evidence of sarilumab efficacy in combination with MTX in moderately to severely active RA adult patients 
who responded inadequately or were intolerant to DMARDs is considered statistically convincing and supported 
by a good concordance among efficacy endpoints. The uncertainties that at present affect the estimation of the 
magnitude of treatment benefit, although need further investigations, are not considered to substantially revert 
the overall sarilumab benefit that has been consistently shown across the two pivotal studies and supported by 
a number of  secondary analyses in this patient population.  
Similarly, the efficacy of sarilumab monotherapy in patients intolerant or irresponsive to MTX is considered 
soundly demonstrated, as well.  
Conversely no direct evidence of efficacy is at present available for sarilumab monotherapy in moderately to 
severely active RA adult patients who responded inadequately or were intolerant to b-DMARs. The Applicant 
extrapolated the use of monotherapy in TNF-IR subjects. Although an extrapolation approach might be 
favourable and comprehensible in some cases this approach seemed not to be acceptable in the current 
situation.  
Rheumatoid arthritis is a heterogenous disease, and even though demographic data may be comparable, 
patients that do not respond adequately to TNF-inhibitors are considered to have a disease that is more difficult 
to treat. 
The fact that the results for monotherapy in the MTX-IR population showed a better trend than combination 
therapy in the TNFi-IR population cannot support a claim that monotherapy would be effective in the latter 
group. Current data does not support RA indication for both monotherapy in bDMARDs-IR patients and 
combination therapy with cDMARDs. 
A limited number of subjects received other cDMARDs than MTX in the pivotal study where non-MTX DMARDs 
were allowed as background therapy (115 subjects in Study 10832).  CHMP considers that the data is therefore 
too limited to support for a broad indication of conventional DMARDS and that combination therapy should not 
include conventional DMARDs as a group. The different DMARDs are not to be regarded as equivalent, neither for 
mode of action nor in terms of safety. Therefore there is not enough data to support other combinations than 
with MTX. 
In addition, considering the large number of treatment options that have become available for RA, and as the 
choice and the order of treatments may differ between prescribers/centers, it may not be feasible anymore to 
exactly define the second line indication in the labelling. As such the indication should be further modified to 
rephrase the specific indication of RA patients irresponsive/intolerant to c-DMARDs or biologic DMARDs into a 
more general second line indication: one or more DMARDs. 
The applicant amended the wording of the indication accordingly into: 
“Kevzara in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active 
rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more 
disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs. Kevzara can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or 
when treatment with MTX is inappropriate”. 
The most important favourable effects are the improvements in signs and symptoms (ACR20/50/70), 
improvement in physical function measured as the change from baseline in HAQ-DI and the reduction of 
progression in structural damage measured until week 52(mTSS) and the efficacy of sarilumab monotherapy 
(measured regarding DAS28-ESR) in comparison with adalimumab monotherapy. The evidence of efficacy was 
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 186/189 
  
  
statistically convincing. Improvement in signs and symptoms and concerning physical function is clinically 
important for patients. A reduction of progression is important as RA is an ongoing disease, slowing down the 
progression of the disease is important for the quality of life of the patients who suffer from this life-long, not 
curable disease. 
Overall the safety profile of sarilumab both as monotherapy and in combination with cDMARDs appears 
sufficiently characterised in the population of the claimed indication, with the notable exception of sarilumab 
monotherapy in patients b-DMARD-IR, for which the few available data have not been presented and discussed. 
Most of the more frequently reported AEs appear of mild, moderate grade, manageable in the clinical setting, 
and reversible upon dose decrease or treatment interruption. In general, adequate information on serious AEs, 
dose reduction and treatment interruption is already included in the SmPC. Hypersensitivity reactions are a 
known unfavourable effect for all biologicals.  
However, serious hypersensitivity reactions were also reported, albeit rarely, following sarilumab sc injection, as 
such appropriate information has been added in the SmPC The most important risks of the treatment with 
sarilumab are serious infections and neutropenia, both dose-dependent, and gastrointestinal perforations as 
well as serious hypersensitivity reactions. Serious infections and neutropenia were dose dependent effect. As a 
lower dose of sarilumab is available these effects could be managed by dose reductions. The occurrence of 
infections, and serious infections, including opportunistic infections, observed in sarilumab-treated patients, is 
considered an important safety issue, particularly because, patients with treatment-induced low neutrophil 
count could be at higher risk of severe infections. Although the available evidence does not suggest a direct 
correlation between neutropenia and infections, the risk needs to be taken into account. A warning has been 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Gastrointestinal disorders only occurred in the patients treated with sarilumab. The occurrence could be due to 
the effect of the IL6-antagonist in the gastrointestinal tract.  
Taking into account the role of IL-6 in inducing B cells differentiation and data coming from non-clinical animal 
studies reporting reversible changes in IgG responses and concentrations, although the effect of these changes 
on responses to vaccination was not studied, concerns about patient’s ability to generate a sufficient humoral 
immune response remain. In this regard, “use of vaccination in patients receiving sarilumab” and 
“Immunoglobulins levels following sarilumab treatment” have been added as missing information in the RMP.  
The uncertainties that characterise the long-term safety, namely the risk of malignancy and MACEs, derive from 
the mechanism of action of the drug, as no direct indication of an increased risk of CV risk or malignancy is 
retrieved from the available clinical data, and the indirect comparison with literature and patient database. 
However, due to the known higher risk of RA patients to develop malignancies compared to the general 
population and the status of immunosuppression in these patients, malignancies are considered a potential risk. 
It is although acknowledged that all biological drugs already marketed for the treatment of RA have faced this 
long-term risk,that has been managed with its inclusion in the RMP and appropriate information reflected in the 
SmPC. Similarly, a relationship between lipid increase and CV risk during sarilumab treatment cannot be ruled 
out at present, considering that the RA population is at higher risk of CV diseases compared to the general 
population. Although not resolvable at present, this risk may be taken into account by including a warning on the 
increased risk of cardiovascular disorders in patients with RA in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The potential risk of demyelinating disorders has been already highlighted at the time the first IL-6 drug was 
approved for the treatment of RA, albeit central and peripheral inflammatory demyelinating diseases were rarely 
reported.  
Assessment report  
EMA/292840/2017 
Page 187/189 
  
  
However, from available data, there was no evidence that sarilumab treatment was associated with 
demyelinating disorder. Two cases suggestive of demyelinating disorders were identified: one case of 
transverse myelitis occurred 7 months post-study in which the assessment of a causal relationship with the 
study drug was confounded by prior and concomitant use of anti-TNFs, and one case reported as Multifocal 
Motor Neuropathy, for which, however, a definitive diagnosis of MMN and/or a causal relation with sarilumab, 
have not been confirmed by the Applicant. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall Benefit/Risk of Kevzara is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Kevzara is favourable in the following indication: 
Kevzara in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or 
more disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Kevzara can be given as monotherapy in case of 
intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate (see section 5.1).

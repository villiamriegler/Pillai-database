RECOMMENDATION 
The  CHMP  noted  the  submission  of  two  paediatric  studies  in  accordance  with 
Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  hereafter  referred  to  as  Paediatric 
Regulation,  and  confirmeds  that  there  was  no  impact  on  either  the  Product 
Information  or  on  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  the  EU  authorised  formulations  of 
Keppra. 
II. 
INTRODUCTION 
This assessment report concerns two study reports submitted under Article 46 of 
the  Paediatric  Regulation.  Both  studies  are  open-label,  single-arm,  multi-centre 
studies  which  investigated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  adjunctive  treatment  with 
levetiracetam in Japanese paediatric patients ≥4 to <16 years) with uncontrolled 
generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures despite treatment with 1 or 2 antiepileptic 
drug(s). 
Levetiracetam (LEV) dry syrup, a formulation (approved for use in Japan in June 
2013) developed for use in Japan for children and in patients who have difficulty 
swallowing  tablets,  is  not  a  registered  formulation  in  the  EU,  so  no  changes  to 
the  approved  EU  Product  Information  for  Keppra  are  proposed  following  the 
completion  of  this  study.  At  this  time,  the  MAH  considers  that  the  standard 
immediate  release  formulations  of  Keppra  allow  for  appropriate  use  of  LEV  in 
paediatric patients in the EU.

STUDIES 
III.1  Study N01223 
III.1.1  Introduction 
investigating 
Study  N01223  was  an  open  label  multicentre  trial,  using  but  a  single  arm,  with 
the  goal  of 
the  efficacy,  safety,  and  pharmacokinetics  of 
levetiracetam  used  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  Japanese  paediatric  patients  equal 
to  or  older  than  4  and  younger  than  16  years  of  age  whom  have  uncontrolled 
partial seizures despite treatment with 1 or 2 anti-epileptic drug(s). 
A total 30 investigators in 30 centres participated, all located in Japan. 
The  study  consisted  of  two  periods,  the  first  one  taking  28  weeks  to  complete, 
including  an  8  week  baseline  period,  and  4  week  up-titration  period,  a  10  week 
evaluation  period  and  a  6  week  withdrawal  period.  Patients  whom  had  finished 
the  first  period  were  eligible  to  participate  in  the  second  in  order  to  continue 
receiving Keppra until market approval. 
III.1.2  Objectives 
First Period 
Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of Levetiracetam (LEV) dry syrup at doses up 
to a maximum of 60mg/kg/day (or 3000mg/day if ≥ 50 kilograms) if used 
as  an  adjunctive  therapy  in  Japanese  paediatric  subjects  ≥4  to  <16 
Page 4/31 
 
years old with uncontrolled partial seizures despitetreatment with 1 or 2 
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 
Secondary: To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of LEV dry syrup (up to 
60mg/kg/day or 3000mg/day if ≥ 50 kgs). 
Second Period 
Primary:  Provide  LEV  to  willing  subjects  deemed  to  benefit  from  long-term 
treatment. 
Continuous evaluation of the safety of long-term LEV administration at 
doses  from  20mg/kg/day  (1000mg/day  if  ≥  50  kgs)  to  60mg/kg/day 
(3000mg/day if ≥ 50 kgs). 
Secondary: Continuous evaluation of the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of long-
term  administration  of  LEV  at  doses  ranging  from  20mg/kg/day  to 
60mg/kg/day or 1000mg/day to 3000mg/day if ≥ 50 kgs. 
III.1.3  Study Methodology 
The  study  was  an  open-label,  single-arm,  multi-center  study  consisting  of  2 
periods  in  Japanese  children  ≥ 4  to  <16  years  old  with  uncontrolled  partial 
seizures despite treatment with 1 or 2 concomitant AED(s). The study consisted 
of  two  periods,  the  first  one  of  which  took  28  weeks  and  had  4  sub-periods: 
Baseline,  Up-Titration,  Evaluation  and  Withdrawal.  This  was  then  followed  by  a 
second  period  in  which  participants  of  the  first  period  could  enter  in  order  to 
continue receiving Keppra until market approval in Japan. 
The  first  period  consisted  of  obtaining  the  patient’s  informed  consent,  checking 
her/his  eligibility,  starting  the  patient  on  a  dose  of  20  mg  LEV/KG/day 
(1000mg/day), followed by a four week up-titration (20mg/kg/day or 1000mg/day 
for  2  weeks  and  40mg/kg/day  or  2000mg/day  for  2  weeks).  They  then  entered 
the  Evaluation  Period,  during  which  the  subjects  received  LEV  60mg/kg/day  or 
3000mg/day for 10 weeks, and the investigators were permitted to decrease the 
dose  to  40mg/kg/day  or  2000mg/day  once  if  any  issues  in  tolerability  were 
confirmed  When  the subject  or  investigator  decided  to  stop treatment, the dose 
was gradually decreased at rate of 20mg/kg/day (1000mg/day if over 50kg) every 
two weeks. Two weeks after the last dose a final visit was to take place, where it 
would also be decided if continuing treatment in period 2 would be beneficial of 
not. 
After patients were admitted to the second period they began individualized LEV 
treatment based on the dose they had received at the end of the evaluation sub-
period  of  the  first  treatment  period.  Those  subjects  with  a  body  weight  over  20 
kilograms  were  allowed  to  change  their  received  formulation  to  tablets  or  back 
again  at  any  time  during  this  period.  As  long  as  concomitant  AED  had  been 
stable  for  at  least  4  weeks,  the  investigators  were  allowed  to  change  dose  and 
mode of administration of LEV and AED administered to patients. Introduction of 
Page 5/31 
 
 
AEDs  other  than  those  taken  already  during  the  first  period  was  forbidden. 
Discontinuation  during  this  period  was  done  at  a  rate  of  10mg/kg/day  to 
20mg/kg/day or 500mg/day to 1000mg/day (if bodyweight ≥ 50kg) every 2 weeks. 
In the protocol a total of 70 subjects was planned to be randomized (As this study 
was aimed to confirm the clinical efficacy of LEV in Japanese paediatric patients 
and seeing that study N159 demonstrated the superiority of LEV against placebo 
treatment,  the  latter’s  estimate  methodology  was  used  to  establish  the  needed 
sample size for this study), with a total of 73 patients being entered into the first 
period and receiving at least one dose of LEV in practice. Of these 73 subjects 
62  completed  the  first  period  and  eventually  55  of  these  entered  the  second 
period. 
III.1.4  Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria 
Only subjects between 4 and 16 years of age, with a bodyweight of 11 kilograms 
or above, but below 82 kilograms, with uncontrolled partial seizures, whether or 
not secondarily generalized which had been diagnosed and confirmed at least 6 
months  before  the  first  visit  could  participate.  In  addition,  subjects  had  to  have 
been experiencing at least 4 partial seizures during the 4 weeks prior to visit 1, 
and  have  at  least  4  partial  seizures  during  the  first  and  last  4  weeks  of  the 
baseline period. The subject had to be on a stable AED treatment consisting of 
no  more  than  2  AEDs  during  the  4  weeks  prior  to  visit  1  and  AED  treatments 
could  not  be  changed  during  baseline,  up-titration  and  evaluation  sub-periods, 
while outright deletion or addition of AEDs were forbidden during the entire study. 
In order to be eligible for the second study period, the subject in question had to 
have completed the first period and deemed needing to be continuously treated 
with LEV by the investigators. 
A history of status epilepticus in the 3 months preceding visit 1, having treatable 
seizure etiology, having epilepsy secondary to a progressive cerebral disease or 
any other progressively neurodegenerative disease, uncountable seizures due to 
clustering, pseudo seizures, having Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, progressive CNS 
or  psychiatric  disorders,  clinically  significant  acute/chronic/terminal  illnesses, 
conditions  that  might  interfere  with  study  protocol  adherence  or  medicine 
metabolisation,  being  on  a  ketogenic  diet  and  having  a  known  allergy  to 
pyrrolidone derivatives or a history of multiple drug allergies were all reasons to 
be denied entry into the study population. 
III.1.5  Endpoints 
First period 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  percentage  reduction  from  baseline  in 
partial seizure frequencies per week during the treatment period (up-titration and 
evaluation). 
The most important secondary efficacy variables were: 
• 
The  percentage  reduction  in  partial  seizure  frequency  per  week  from 
Baseline over the Evaluation Period 
Page 6/31 
 
•  Partial seizure frequency per week over the Treatment Period 
•  Partial seizure frequency per week over the Evaluation Period 
•  Partial seizures 50% responder rate (the proportion of subjects with 50% or 
more  reduction  from  Baseline  in  the  frequency  of  partial  epileptic  seizures) 
over the Treatment Period 
•  Partial seizures 50% responder rate (the proportion of subjects with 50% or 
more  reduction  from  Baseline  in  the  frequency  of  partial  epileptic  seizures) 
over the Evaluation Period 
•  Seizure freedom over the Treatment Period 
•  Seizure freedom over the Evaluation Period 
• 
Levetiracetam plasma concentrations throughout the study 
•  Adverse events (AEs) 
• 
Laboratory  assessments, 
urinalysis 
•  Electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
including  blood  chemistry,  hematology,  and 
•  Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature) 
•  Body weight and height 
Second period 
The primary variable was the incidence of AEs over the Second Period. 
The most important secondary variables collected were: 
• 
• 
The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) over the Second Period 
The  percentage  reduction  from  Baseline  in  partial  seizure  frequency  per 
week  by  3-month  windows  over  the  evaluation  period  in  the  second  period 
(excluding the withdrawal period)

III.1.6  Subject Disposition 
The subject disposition for this study is summarized in flowchart 1. 
Flowchart 1 : Subject disposition 
Efficacy  deviations  which  had  an  impact  on  the  efficacy,  were  reported  by  3 
subjects (4.1%) in period 1. Of these 3 subjects, 1 subject was partially excluded 
from the PPS and 2 subjects were totally excluded. 
Page 8/31 
 
 
Demographic  profiles  concerning  a  number  of  important  characteristics  during 
both periods are detailed below:

Table 3: Epilepsy etiology 
Table 4: Partial seizure frequency 
Table 5: Concomitant AEDs 
Page 10/31 
 
 
 
 
 
Important deviations, which led to exclusion from the efficacy analysis, were 
reported by 3 subjects (4.1%). Of the 3 subjects, 1 subject was partially excluded 
from the PPS and 2 subjects were totally excluded. The former reported a 
deviation for the use for restricted concomitant medication and rescue 
medications at Visit 7, which led to the data for this subject after Visit 7 to be 
excluded from the efficacy analysis in the PPS. One subject used restricted 
concomitant medications Prior to the first dose of LEV treatment at Visit 3, and 
another used the rescue medications at Visit 3. Therefore, the data for these 2 
subjects were totally excluded from the PPS. No subjects reported protocol 
deviations for subject eligibility in efficacy. 
III.1.7  Efficacy Results 
The primary efficacy endpoint, the median percentage reduction from baseline in 
partial  seizures  per  week  during  the  14-week  treatment  period  attained  43.21% 
(26.19  <  95%CI  <  52.14%),  which  meant  that  the  predefined  criterion  for  a 
positive efficacy result (the lower limit of the 95% CI at greater than 16.3%, the 
median percentage reduction of the seizure frequency per week of the subjects 
in  the  placebo  group  of  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study 
(N159)) was met. 
Table 6: Percentage reduction over the Treatment Period for the First Period (FAS) 
Subgroup  analysis  on  age,  gender,  body  weight,  epileptic  syndrome,  baseline 
seizure frequency per week and number and types of concomitant AEDs did not 
reveal  any  demographic  characteristic  that  may  influence  the  above  result,  with 
subgroup median percentage reductions lying between 20.35% and 63.26%.

the  Up-Titration  Period, 
During 
the  subjects  received  LEV  20mg/kg/day 
(1000mg/day  if  over  50  kgs)  for  2  weeks,  40mg/kg/day  (2000mg/day  if  over  50 
kgs) for 2 weeks, and then started 60mg/kg/day (3000mg/day) if tolerability was 
confirmed.  The  median  percentage  reduction  in  seizure  frequency  during  this 
sub-period was 32.87%. The median percentage reduction at each visit from visit 
4  until  visit  8  ranged  between  37.05  and  44.39%,  with  the  reduction  in  seizure 
frequency appearing to be sustained over time. 
The  seizure  frequency  per  week  was  3.50  at  Visit  4  when  LEV  treatment  had 
started,  compared  to  6.25  at  Visit  3  prior  to  LEV  treatment.  The  reduction  in 
seizure  frequency  was  seen  at  the  time  of  the  initial  LEV  dose  of  20mg/kg/day 
and the percentage reduction appeared to be sustained over time. 
Page 15/31 
 
 
The median percentage reduction in seizure frequency during the second period 
was  41.32%,  closely  mirroring  the  percentage  seen  in  the  first  period.  The 
efficacy of LEV treatment was shown to be sustained over time as an adjunctive 
therapy in a long term use. 
The  percentage  reduction  in  seizure  frequency  per  week  and  actual  seizure 
frequency  seen  in  period  2  is  summarized  in  table  14.  There  were  no  subjects 
who were seizure free during the Second Period 
Page 16/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III.1.8  Pharmacokinetics/-dynamics - Results 
The  fact  that  all  subjects  received  the  protocol-defined  LEV  dosage  during  the 
first  period  and  second  period  was  reflected  in  the  observed  LEV  plasma 
concentrations. During the second period, the doses administered to the subjects 
were higher than those during the first period, leading to very limited number of 
concentrations  for  the  10  mg/kg/bid  target  dose  group.  Although  23  subjects 
(41.8%)  switched  from  the  dry  syrup  to  the  tablets  and  the  number  of 
concentrations  is  lower  during  the  second  period,  the  concentrations  vs  time 
points  profile  observed  during  the  second  period  was  overall  similar  to  that 
observed during the first period. 
Overall,  the  concentrations  for  both  the  first  period  and  second  period  were 
below 30μg/mL for the target dose of 10mg/kg/bid, below 50μg/mL for the target 
dose of 20mg/kg/bid, and below 80μg/mL for the target dose of 30mg/kg/bid. The 
increase of concentrations seemed to be in proportion to the dose with maximal 
concentrations  reached  between  1  and  4  hours  post  dose.  The  concentrations 
subsequently decreased and remained quantifiable for at least 16 hours for each 
dose.  The  resulting  concentrations  were  within  the  levels  seen  in  previous 
studies. 
III.1.9  Safety Results 
Safety evaluations for periods of +3 years in this study indicated that LEV at the 
doses provided throughout (20 to 60 mg/kg/day or 1000 to 3000 mg/day if over 
50 kilos) was well-tolerated in the subject group studied. 
During the whole of the study the mean duration of exposure to LEV was 714.25 
(SD = 448.93) days with a mean dose of 47.37mg/kg (SD = 11.42) in 73 subjects. 
The  total  exposure  to  LEV  throughout  the  study  (expressed  in  days)  and  the 
mean LEV daily doses are summarised in tables 6 and 7. 
Table 15: Days of exposure to LEV (FAS) during All Periods 
Page 17/31 
 
 
 
 
Table 16: Mean LEV daily dose (mg/kg) (FAS) during All Periods 
There  were  802  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  reported  in  70 
subjects  (95.9%  of  study  population),  91  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  in  43 
subjects (58.9%) and 14 SAEs in 8 subjects (11%). Discontinuations and dosage 
adaptions due to TEAEs were reported in 7 and 16 subjects respectively. Of all 
the reported TEAEs 3 were severe, with a case of status epilepticus, somnolence 
and a near-drowning with fatal consequences. 
Before treatment start (visit 3), 72 pretreatment adverse events (AEs) were noted 
in  40  subjects  (54,8%  of  participants)  with  the  most  frequently  reported  ones 
being nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (respectively 23.3 and 
6.8 percent of subjects), while all other pretreatment AEs had an incidence lower 
than  2.7%.  Three  pretreatment  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  were  noted, 
pneumonia, tibia fracture, and convulsion, all which resolved without sequelae. 
The most frequently reported ADR was somnolence in 31 subjects (42.5%), that 
is to say 30 subjects (41.1%) in the first and 2 subjects (3.6%) during the second 
period. The majority of the ADRs were mild or moderate in intensity. There was 
only  1  severe  ADR  of  somnolence  during  the  first  period.  The  event  did  not 
resolve;  however,  it  did  not  lead  to  study  discontinuation.  There  was  1  serious 
ADR  of  acetonaemic  vomiting  during  the  second  period.  The  event  was  judged 
Page 18/31 
 
 
 
 
 
by the investigator as unlikely related to LEV and resolved 3 days after the event 
onset. 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  nasopharyngitis  in  54  subjects 
(74.0%),  followed  by  somnolence  in  34  subjects (46.6%).  The former  showed  a 
consistent occurrence pattern across periods with 39.7% and 76.4% of subjects 
developing this AE during the first and second periods respectively. Somnolence 
showed  a  marked  drop  off  going  from  the  first  to  second  period,  with  the 
incidence dropping from 43.8% to 12.7%. 
As  stated  earlier,  3  severe  TEAEs  occurred  during  the  study,  a  case  of 
somnolence during the first period (considered related to LEV, unresolved but the 
subject  continued  study  participation),  and  one  case  of  status  epilepticus 
(considered  not  related  to  LEV  treatment  and  resolved)  and  another  of  (fatal) 
near drowning in the second (considered not related to study treatment). 
In regards to the fatal near drowning, the cause was considered to be the onset 
of  a  seizure  while  taking  a  bath,  which  led  to  a  cardiopulmonary  arrest.  On  the 
day following the event onset the subject’s symptom did not improve despite the 
treatment and he died. 
Over  both  periods  there  were  14  SEAs  in  8  subjects  (11.0%).  Of  these  1,  the 
near  drowning,  was  fatal,  as  expounded  upon  earlier,  but  all  other  resolved 
during the study.  
Overall,  age  and  body  weight  did  not  appear  to  influence  the  incidence  of  AEs 
and  no  trends  were  noted.  All  SAEs,  other  than  the  status  epilepticus  and  near 
drowning  (TE)AEs,  were  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity.  Only  one  event,  namely 
conversion  disorder,  led  to  study  discontinuation  while  all  other  SAEs  did  not 
require changes in LEV doses. 
A total of 7 subjects (9.6%) discontinued LEV treatment due to 8 TEAEs, with 4 
subjects  (5.5%)  leaving  the  study  during  the  first  period  and  3  subjects  (5.5%) 
doing so during the second. 
The  clinical  laboratory  evaluations  did  not  indicate  any  clinically  significant 
changes,  though  there  were  parameters  in  hematology,  blood  chemistry,  and 
vital signs that indicated possibly clinically significant (PCS) values. Nevertheless, 
the incidence of each parameter was relatively low and no trends to increase or 
decrease from the baseline values were noted. 
The high incidences of treatment-emergent PCS values in body weight (too low) 
were reported as 24.7% in the first and 34.5% in the second period. Nevertheless, 
the  mean  change  from  the  baseline  in  the  actual  value  at  Visit  8  and  Last  Visit 
was  an  increase  of  0.7kg  and  6.0kg    respectively,  with  there  being  no  clinically 
meaningful  decreases  in  mean  body  weight.  Weight  decrease  is  recognized  as 
an  ADR  for  LEV  in  the  approved  product  labeling,  and  the  observed  changes 
from  the  Baseline  weight  in  this  study  did  not  constitute  an  additional  safety 
concern. 
III.1.10  Conclusions by the MAH 
Page 19/31 
 
The  efficacy  results  showed  a  reduction  in  the  median  percentage  of  partial 
seizures from Baseline across all time intervals and subsequent maintenance of 
efficacy throughout the study periods. The results on the PPS were positive and 
very similar to the results of the FAS analyses. This confirmed the robustness of 
the FAS analyses. 
The  efficacy  of  LEV  treatment  was  verified  and  deemed  clinically  relevant 
because  the  median  percentage  reduction  from  baseline  in  partial  seizure 
frequency per week over the 14-week Treatment Period in the FAS was 43.21% 
and the 95% CI was between 26.19% and 52.14%. The lower limit of the 95% CI, 
26.19%, was greater than the predefined value of 16.3%, which was the median 
percentage  reduction  of  the  seizure  frequency  per  week  of  the  subjects  in  the 
placebo  group  of  a  28-week,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study 
(N159). 
Similar  to  the  First  Period,  there  was  a  reduction  in  the  median  percentage  of 
seizures during the Second Period. The median percentage reduction in seizure 
frequency  over  the  Evaluation  Period  during  the  Second  Period  was  41.32% 
compared to the First Period; 43.21% over the 14-week Treatment Period during 
the  First  Period.  The  efficacy  of  LEV  treatment  was  sustained  over  time  as  an 
adjunctive therapy in a long term use. 
The safety profile showed that long-term treatment with LEV was generally  well 
tolerated in the subjects in this study. Levetiracetam was safe and well tolerated, 
as  evaluated  by  the  safety  data,  which  covered  longer  than  3  years  for  the 
subjects with exposure to LEV. 
Nasopharyngitis and somnolence were reported as distinctive TEAEs throughout 
the  study.  Nasopharyngitis  was  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  with  the 
incidence of 74.0% during the All Periods, and consistently occurred across the 
study  periods.  An  increase  in  the  incidence  of  nasopharyngitis  was  observed 
during the Second Period. This was considered due to the influence of the study 
duration that was longer in the second period. 
Somnolence appeared to be related to LEV treatment. After the first dose of LEV 
20mg/kg/day, 32.9% of the subjects reported somnolence during the Up-Titration 
Period.  The  onset  of  this  event  was  increased  to  43.8%  during  the  First  Period 
and was markedly decreased to 1.9% at the first 6 months of the Second Period. 
The  subjects  who  experienced  somnolence  appeared  to  adapt  the  LEV  dose, 
which led to the decrease in the number of the subjects who reported the event 
later in the course of study. Somnolence assessed as an ADR was reported by 
42.5%  of  subjects  during  the  All  Periods  with  an  exception  of  1  event  that  was 
severe,  while  all  events  were  mild  in  intensity.  The  severe  somnolence  was  a 
result  of  aggravation  of  a  mild  somnolence  that  occurred  2  days  after  the 
initiation  of  LEV  treatment.  Worsening  of  the  intensity  was  associated  with  an 
increase of LEV dose during the Evaluation Period. Although the somnolence did 
not  resolve, the  subject  who  experienced  the  severe  somnolence  continued  the 
study participation with a decreased LEV dose, which was also indicative that the 
subject could adapt the LEV dose and continue LEV treatment. 
Page 20/31 
 
The only ADR assessed as serious was an event of acetonaemic vomiting, which 
was  judged  by  the  investigator  as  unlikely  related  to  LEV  and  resolved  3  days 
after  the  event  onset.  With  an  exception  of  a  fatal  SAE  of  near  drowning 
(considered  not  related  to  the  treatment),  all  other  SAEs  resolved  during  the 
study. 
There  were  parameters  in  hematology,  blood  chemistry,  and  vital  signs  that 
indicated  PCS  values;  however,  the  incidence  of  each  parameter  was  relatively 
low and no trends in shifts from Baseline were noted.  
The high incidences of treatment-emergent PCS values (too low) in body weight 
were reported as 24.7% in the First Period and 34.5% in the Second Period. In 
spite of this, the incidences of treatment-emergent PCS values in body weight did 
not  suggest  that  the  body  weight  became  notably  low  after  LEV  treatment.  The 
mean change in weight at Visit 8 from the Baseline was an increase of 0.7kg and 
there were no clinically meaningful decreases in mean body weight. 
In  conclusion,  long-term  adjunctive  treatment  with  LEV  at  the  doses  of 
20mg/kg/day  or  1000mg/day  to  60mg/kg/day  or  3000mg/day  was  effective  in 
Japanese  children  aged  ≥4 
to  <16  years  with  partial  onset  seizures. 
Levetiracetam  plasma  concentrations  were  within  the  ranges  seen  in  previous 
studies.  The  results  of  efficacy  measures  demonstrated  a  reduction  in  seizures 
from  Baseline  and  maintenance  of  efficacy.  Levetiracetam  was  safe  and  well 
tolerated, as evaluated by the safety data which covered longer than 3 years for 
the subjects with exposure to LEV.

III.2  Study N01363 
III.2.1  Introduction 
Study N01363 was an n open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  adjunctive  treatment  with  levetiracetam  in  Japanese 
paediatric  patients  (≥4  to  <16  years)  with  uncontrolled  generalized  tonic-clonic 
(GTC) seizures despite treatment with 1 or 2 antiepileptic drug(s). 
III.2.2  Objectives 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEV dry syrup at doses up to 60mg/kg/day 
or 3000mg/day used as adjunctive therapy in Japanese paediatric subjects aged 
≥4  to  <16  years  with  uncontrolled  GTC  seizures,  despite  treatment  with  1  or
antiepileptic drugs (AED[s]).

No other objectives, secondary or primary were planned. 
III.2.3  Study Methodology 
This  study  was  designed  as  an  open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter  study  taking 
34 weeks, excluding a 4-week Retrospective Baseline, divided in 4 periods: 
-  Combined  Baseline  Period  (8  weeks:  4-week  Retrospective  Baseline  +  4-
week  Prospective  Baseline):  During  this  period,  informed  consent  was 
obtained  and  eligibility  assessed.  A  daily  record  card  was  dispensed  and 
samples for laboratory assessments were collected for the blood chemistry, 
hematology,  urinalysis,  and  pregnancy  test  (if  applicable).  For  subjects 
without  Retrospective  Baseline  documentation,  an  8-week  Prospective 
Baseline Period was scheduled. 
Page 22/31 
 
 
-  Up-Titration  Period  (4  weeks):  During  this  period,  subjects  started  the  LEV 
treatment  at  20mg/kg/day  (subject  weighing  ≥50kg  started  at  1000mg/day) 
that was up-titrated to 60mg/kg/day (subject weighing ≥50kg was up-titrated 
to  3000mg/day).  The  LEV  dose  was  increased  by  20mg/kg/day  every  2 
weeks (subject weighing ≥50kg was increased by 1000mg/day).  
- 
Evaluation  Period 
administered LEV at 60mg/kg/day or 3000mg/day.  
(20  weeks):  During 
this  period,  subjects  were 
-  Withdrawal Period (6 weeks including the 2-week follow up after the last LEV 
intake):  During  this  period,  the  LEV  dose  was  reduced  as  gradually  as 
possible  to  protect  subjects  from  aggravation  of  seizures,  considering  the 
subject’s  safety.  All  of  the  subjects  in  this  period  were  required  to  attend  a 
Follow-Up Visit 2 weeks after the last dosing of the treatment with LEV. 
At  the  end  of  the  evaluation  period,  if  the  Investigator  decided  to  continue  LEV 
treatment  and  the  subject  agreed,  the  latter  continued  the  treatment  with  open-
label LEV in the long-term follow-up study, N01361. If the Investigator decided to 
discontinue LEV treatment, the subject entered the Withdrawal Period. 
It was planned for least 15 subjects to enroll in this study, but even if this number 
was reached, further subject recruitment was to be continued until the time when 
the last subject first visit was completed in N01159, a different study to evaluate 
the  efficacy  and  safety  of  adjunctive  treatment  with  LEV  in  subjects  aged  ≥16 
years  with  GTC  seizures.  In  reality,  enrollment  ended  after  13  subjects  were 
enrolled  in  the  study  due  to  difficulties  in  enrolling  eligible  subjects  (with 
permission of the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency).

III.2.6  Subject Disposition 
In  total  13  subjects  were  screened  and  enrolled;  there  were  no  screen  failures. 
Eleven  subjects  (84.6%)  completed  the  study  and  entered  the  follow-up  study, 
N01361. Two subjects (15.4%) discontinued the study. 
Note: N01361 was an open-label, long-term, follow-up study for subjects ≥4 years of age. 
Note: Subject 306-01807 discontinued the study for reason of other; the subject was administered an additional antiepileptic drug. 
Page 25/31 
 
 
One subject (7.7%) discontinued the study due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
of headache and somnolence. The ADRs were moderate in intensity, not serious, 
and were resolved upon follow up.  
The other discontinuation was due to reasons classified as ‘other’. 
One subject (7.7%) had 1 important protocol deviation whereby the Up-Titration 
Period  was  not  started  with  administration  of  LEV  20mg/kg/day  as  described  in 
the Protocol, but instead with LEV 40mg/kg/day. No action was taken in regards 
to this deviation. 
III.2.7  Efficacy Results 
The  primary  efficacy  variable,  the  median  percentage  reduction  in  GTC  seizure 
frequency  per  week  from  the  Combined  Baseline  Period  over  the  Treatment 
Period, was 56.52% with a CI as shown in table 1.  
Table 1: Descriptive statistics of GTC seizure frequency during the Combined Baseline Period and over the 
Treatment Period 
The  percentage  of  GTC  seizures  per  week  was  reduced  from  the  Combined 
Baseline Period over the Treatment Period across all subgroups by age, gender, 
epileptic  syndrome,  Baseline  seizure  frequency,  and  concomitant  AEDs  at 
Baseline.  Although  some  differences  in  percentage  reduction  of  GTC  seizures 
were  observed  between  subgroups,  there  were  too  few  subjects  to  permit 
meaningful comparisons. 
Page 26/31 
 
 
 
 
Table 2: Percentage reduction of GTC seizure frequency per week from the Combined Baseline Period over the 
Treatment Period by subgroup (FAS) 
Generalized  tonic-clonic  seizure  frequency  also  showed  improvement  from  the 
Combined  Baseline  Period  over  the  Evaluation  Period;  the  median  percent 
reduction in GTC seizure frequency per week was 64.70% as seen in table 3. 
Table 3: Generalized tonic-clonic seizure frequency per week and reduction from the Combined Baseline Period 
over the Evaluation Period (FAS) 
The  GTC  50%  responder  rates  for  the  Treatment  Period  and  Evaluation  Period 
were  53.8%  (7  of  13  subjects) and  58.3%  (7  of  12  subjects), respectively.  Four 
Page 27/31 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects were 75% responders for the Treatment Period (30.8%) and Evaluation 
Period (33.3%).  
Generalized  tonic-clonic  seizure  freedom  in  subjects  was  also  similar  between 
the  Treatment  Period  and  Evaluation  Period.  Two  subjects  were  seizure  free 
during the former and 2 were likewise during the latter. 
The time to the first GTC seizure during the Treatment Period ranged from Day 1 
(the  first  day  of  LEV  treatment)  for  1  subject,  to  Day  169  and  Day  173  of  the 
Treatment Period for the 2 subjects who remained seizure free.  
There was no worsening of GTC seizure frequency during the Up-Titration Period 
and overall improvement in GTC seizure frequency was seen at each visit after 
starting treatment with LEV.  
III.2.8  Safety Results 
In  total  41  treatment-emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  that  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
severity were reported and no treatment-emergent serious AEs (SAEs) or deaths 
occurred.  
As  mentioned  earlier,  one  subject  discontinued  the  study  due  to  adverse  drug 
reactions (ADRs).  
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  nasopharyngitis,  convulsion,  and 
somnolence,  each  reported  by  3  subjects  (23.1%)  overall.  Adverse  drug 
reactions  were  reported  by  5  subjects  (38.5%)  overall.  The  most  frequently 
reported ADR was somnolence, reported by 3 subjects (23.1%) overall. 
In  general,  ≤2  subjects  reported  post-baseline  values  that  were  considered 
possibly  clinically  significant  (PCS)  for  any  hematology  or  blood  chemistry 
variable; no urinalysis results were PCS. Shifts from not PCS at Baseline to PCS 
post  Baseline  were  reported  for  hematocrit  (too  high),  leukocytes  (too  high), 
neutrophils (too low), triglycerides (too high), and urate (too high).  
The  most  frequently  reported  vital  sign  measurement  with  a  PCS  shift  from 
Baseline was diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Six subjects (46.2%) reported DBP 
measurement  shifts  from  not  PCS  at  Baseline  to  too  low  or  too  high  post 
Baseline.  Systolic  blood  pressure  measurements  also  showed  PCS  shifts  from 
Baseline  for  2  subjects  and  pulse  rate  measurements  shifted  for  1  subject 
(7.7%).  These  changes  were  not  considered  clinically  significant  by  the 
Investigator.  
One subject (9.1%) reported an abnormal ECG finding of prolonged QT interval 
at  Visit  9.  The  event  was  considered  a  clinically  significant  ADR  that  was  not 
serious, mild in intensity, and was resolved after entering the long-term follow-up 
study. 
None  of  the  observed  laboratory  values  or  physical  examination  presented 
findings that were of concern.

III.2.9  Conclusions by the MAH 
improvement 
the  efficacy  results  demonstrated 
Overall, 
in  GTC  seizure 
frequency  with  adjunctive  LEV  treatment  across  all  population  subgroups  and 
over all study periods and visits. The primary efficacy variable was the reduction 
in  GTC  seizure  frequency  from  the  Combined  Baseline  Period  over  the 
Treatment  Period.  There  were  some  differences  in  the  median  reduction  when 
analyzed  by  subgroup,  but  given  the  small  sample  size,  any  interpretation  of 
these  results  is  difficult.  Nonetheless,  improvement  in  GTC  seizure  frequency 
was observed in all subgroups. 
The  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  the  reduction  in  GTC  seizure  frequency 
from  the  Combined  Baseline  Period  over  the  Evaluation  Period  and  the  GTC 
seizure  50%  responder  rates  and  seizure  freedom  over  the  Treatment  Period 
and  Evaluation  Period,  whereby  the  median  percentage  reduction  over  the 
Evaluation  Period  was  64.70%.  The  majority  of  subjects  were  50%  responders 
for  the  Treatment  Period  (53.8%)  and  the  Evaluation  Period  (58.3%)  and  2 
subjects remained seizure free during these study periods. 
From the Combined Baseline Period over the Treatment Period, there was also a 
25% reduction in the number of any type of seizure per week. Levetiracetam is a 
treatment  for  other  seizure  types;  thus,  these  results,  while  limited,  are  not 
unexpected. 
Page 30/31 
 
 
 
The safety profile suggests LEV was generally well tolerated at this exposure in 
the  paediatric  subjects  in  this  study  and  the  AEs  reported  were  consistent  with 
the known safety profile for LEV. 
Overall, there were no clinically relevant trends in TEAE incidence across study 
periods, gender, or age categories. 
The evaluation of clinical laboratories and vital signs did not indicate any clinically 
significant trends in changes from Baseline across study periods. 
The following overall conclusions for N01363 were drawn: 
Levetiracetam  at  doses  up  to  60mg/kg/day  or  3000mg/day  was  effective  in 
reducing  GTC  seizure  frequency  when  used  as  adjunctive  therapy  with  1  or  2 
other AEDs in Japanese paediatric subjects aged ≥4 to <16 years. Furthermore, 
Levetiracetam  was  safe  and  well  tolerated  as  evaluated  by  the  safety  data  and 
there were no new safety concerns for LEV identified in this study. 
However,  due  to  the  small  size  of  N01363,  drawing  conclusions  based  on  the 
limited results presented should obviously be cautioned. 
IV. 
CHMP OVERALL CONCLUSIONS 
these  studies, 
the  efficacy  and  safety  of  adjunctive 
In 
treatment  with 
levetiracetam in Japanese paediatric patients (≥4 to <16 years) with uncontrolled 
generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures despite treatment with 1 or 2 antiepileptic 
drug(s) was confirmed. Keppra was shown to be effective and safe in long-term 
treatment of these subjects. 
As  Keppra  dry  syrup,  the  formulation  mainly  used  throughout  these  studies,  is 
not  a  registered  formulation  in  the  EU,  no  changes  to  the  approved  Product 
Information  for  Keppra  in  the  EU  were  proposed  following  completion  of  these 
studies.  The  MAH  considered  that  the  standard  immediate  release  formulations 
of Keppra allow for appropriate use of levetiracetam in paediatric patients in the 
EU. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
These  studies  were  solely  submitted  to  comply  with  Article  46  of  the  Paediatric 
Regulations.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for vismodegib, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
Seven cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) have been reported in association with 
vismodegib cumulatively. At least one case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(SJS/TEN), 2 cases of Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and one case of 
acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) are causally related to the treatment, based on 
clinical and pathological features, and the compatible temporal relationship. Although the number of 
identified cases is limited, the reactions are serious and the association with vismodegib is plausible. The 
PRAC therefore recommends that the Product Information should be updated accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for vismodegib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing vismodegib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

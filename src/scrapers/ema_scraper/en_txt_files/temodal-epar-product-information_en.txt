CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
Temodal is indicated for the treatment of:
- 
- 
adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy
(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment.
children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such
as glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after
standard therapy.
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Temodal should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment of brain
tumours.
Anti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4).
Posology
Adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
Temodal is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) followed by up
to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase).
3
Concomitant phase 
TMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal
radiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or
discontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and
non-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day
concomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: 
- 
- 
- 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/l
thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l
common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia,
nausea and vomiting). 
During treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be
temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the
haematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.

nausea, vomiting).
Monotherapy phase
Four weeks after completing the TMZ + RT concomitant phase, TMZ is administered for up to
6 cycles of monotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days
followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if
the CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade ≤ 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and
vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is
≥ 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent
cycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent
cycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase
should be applied according to Tables 2 and 3.
During treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of
TMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.

• 
• 
dose level -1 (100 mg/m2) still results in unacceptable toxicity
the same Grade 3 non-haematological toxicity (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting) recurs after dose reduction.
Adult and paediatric patients 3 years of age or older with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma:
A treatment cycle comprises 28 days. In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is
administered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day
treatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial
dose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days
if there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) 
Special populations
Paediatric population
In patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant
glioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy
of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.
Patients with hepatic or renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child’s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the
pharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with
severe hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised
when TMZ is administered in these patients. 
Elderly patients
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is
not affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).
Method of administration
Temodal hard capsules should be administered in the fasting state.
The capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. 
If vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day.
5
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Hypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC).
Severe myelosuppression (see section 4.4).
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Opportunistic infections and reactivation of infections
Opportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections
(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8).
Meningoencephalitis herpetic
In post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in
patients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids
administration.
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia
Patients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule
were shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus,
prophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42-day
regimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they
are to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade ≤ 1.
There may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen.
However, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed
closely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have
been reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other
steroids.
HBV
Hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been
reported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with
positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be
monitored and managed appropriately.
Hepatotoxicity
Hepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see
section 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If
abnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the
potential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should
be repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after
each treatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should
assess the benefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after
the last treatment with temozolomide.
Malignancies
Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have
also been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).
6
Anti-emetic therapy
Nausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.
Anti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.
Adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme 
Anti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is
strongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.
Patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma
Patients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may
require anti-emetic therapy.
Laboratory parameters
Patients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia,
which may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some
cases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including
carbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to
dosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC  1.5 x 109/l and platelet count
 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or
within 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If
ANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should
be reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and
200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2.
Paediatric population 
There is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in
older children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).
Elderly patients (> 70 years of age)
Elderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with
younger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly
patients.
Female patients
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy while they
are receiving TMZ, and for at least 6 months following completion of treatment.
Male patients
Men being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child for at least 3 months after
receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see
section 4.6).
Lactose
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
7
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the
extent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl
triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). 
Administration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under
the curve (AUC). 
As it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temodal should be
administered without food.
Based on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of
dexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or
phenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated
with a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.
No studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of
other medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low
protein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
(see section 5.2).
Use of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of
myelosuppression. 
Paediatric population
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy
There are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2
TMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temodal should not be
administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should be
apprised of the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued
while receiving treatment with TMZ. 
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy while they
are receiving TMZ, and for at least 6 months following completion of treatment.
8
Male fertility
TMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should use effective
contraceptive measures and be advised not to father a child for at least 3 months after receiving the
last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment, because of the possibility
of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
TMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see
section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical trial experience
In patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea,
vomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic adverse
reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is presented after
Table 4.
For patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually
Grade 1 or 2 (0 – 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily
controlled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed
in Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency
groupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); Common
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare
(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency
grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
Laboratory results
Myelosuppression (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), which is known dose-limiting toxicity for
most cytotoxic agents, including TMZ, was observed. When laboratory abnormalities and adverse
events were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4
neutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3
or Grade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of
the patients who received TMZ. 
Recurrent or progressive malignant glioma
Laboratory results
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients
treated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and
4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the
nadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of
cumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk
of bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.
Gender
In a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and
169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male
subjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4
neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9 % vs 3 %, in
women vs men in the first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4
neutropenia occurred in 8 % of female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 %
of female vs 3 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-
diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male
subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of
therapy.
Paediatric population
Oral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or
recurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although
the data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in
children under the age of 3 years has not been established.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
Doses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated
clinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is
expected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle,
over 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia,
multi-organ failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for
more than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow
suppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In
12
the event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be
provided as necessary.
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03
Mechanism of action
Temozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the
active monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to
be due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at
the N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of
the methyl adduct.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
A total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286).
Patients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day
of RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by
monotherapy TMZ (150 - 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting
4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.
TMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in
the RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm.
The hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank
p < 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % vs
10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ
monotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated
a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1).

Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)
The results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance
status (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms.
However, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.
Recurrent or progressive malignant glioma
Data on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status
[KPS]  70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral
TMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the
other was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 %
received prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint
was progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-
comparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was
2.1 months, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on
MRI scans was 8 %.
In the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than
for procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively – chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and
1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for
TMZ and procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving
patients was significantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %)
(chi-square p = 0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a
KPS  80.
Data on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time
to worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The
median times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for
procarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03). 
Recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma
In a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the
treatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The
median PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the
central reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT)
n=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT
14
population was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results
for the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were
similar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was
strongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life.
Paediatric population
Oral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or
recurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance
to TMZ is similar to adults.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
TMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-
1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-
carboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to
methylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is
thought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine.
Relative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In
vivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.
Absorption
After oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached
as early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral
administration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 %
indicating complete absorption.
Distribution
TMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with
highly protein-bound substances.
PET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly
and is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on
AUC of TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.
Elimination
The half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal.
Following oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the
urine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-
carboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.
Plasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and
half-life are independent of dose. 
Special populations
Analysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was
independent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma
pharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those
observed in patients with normal hepatic function.
Paediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults.
15
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Single-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in
rats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system,
testes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and
dogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility,
except for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because
the doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect
has been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.
TMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and
dog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs.
Dose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A
variety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell
adenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were
evident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the
occurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even
for an alkylating agent.
Results of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome
aberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
Temodal is indicated for the treatment of:
- 
- 
adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy
(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment.
children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such
as glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after
standard therapy.
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Temodal should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment of brain
tumours.
Anti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4).
Posology
Adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
Temodal is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) followed by up
to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase).
Concomitant phase
TMZ is administered at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy
(60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or
discontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and
non-haematological toxicity criteria. 
TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day concomitant period (up to 49 days) if all
of the following conditions are met: 
- 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/l 
21
- 
- 
thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l 
common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia,
nausea and vomiting).
During treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be
temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the
haematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.

nausea, vomiting).
Monotherapy phase
Four weeks after completing the TMZ + RT concomitant phase, TMZ is administered for up to
6 cycles of monotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days
followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if
the CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade ≤ 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and
vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is
≥ 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent
cycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent
cycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase
should be applied according to Tables 2 and 3.
During treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of
TMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.

22
Adult and paediatric patients 3 years of age or older with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma:
A treatment cycle comprises 28 days. In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is
administered at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day treatment
interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial dose is
150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days if there
is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) 
Special populations
Paediatric population
In patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant
glioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy
of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.
Patients with hepatic or renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child’s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the
pharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with
severe hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised
when TMZ is administered in these patients. 
Elderly patients
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is
not affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).
Method of administration
Temodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for solution for infusion must be administered only by intravenous
infusion. It must not be given by other routes of administration, such as the intrathecal, intramuscular,
or subcutaneous route. Temodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for solution for infusion may be administered in
the same IV line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection. It is incompatible with dextrose solutions.
The appropriate dose of TMZ should be infused intravenously using a pump over a period of
90 minutes. 
As with other similar chemotherapeutic agents, caution is recommended to avoid extravasation. Local
injection site adverse reactions, which were mostly mild and short-lived were reported in patients
receiving Temodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for solution for infusion. Preclinical studies did not show
permanent tissue damage (see sections 4.8 and 5.3).
Temodal is also available as a hard capsule formulation (oral use). Temodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for
solution for infusion, given as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes, is bioequivalent to the hard
capsule formulation (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Hypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC).
Severe myelosuppression (see section 4.4).
23
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Opportunistic infections and reactivation of infections
Opportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections
(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8).
Meningoencephalitis herpetic
In post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in
patients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids
administration.
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia
Patients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule
were shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus,
prophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42-day
regimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they
are to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade ≤ 1.
There may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen.
However, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed
closely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have
been reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other
steroids.
HBV
Hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been
reported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with
positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be
monitored and managed appropriately.
Hepatotoxicity
Hepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see
section 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If
abnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the
potential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should
be repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after
each treatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should
assess the benefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after
the last treatment with temozolomide.
Malignancies
Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have
also been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).
Anti-emetic therapy 
Nausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ. 
Anti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.
24
Adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
Anti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is
strongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.
Patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma
Patients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may
require anti-emetic therapy.
Laboratory parameters
Patients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia,
which may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some
cases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including
carbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to
dosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC  1.5 x 109/l and platelet count
 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or
within 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If
ANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should
be reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and
200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2.
Paediatric population 
There is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in
older children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).
Elderly patients (> 70 years of age)
Elderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with
younger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly
patients.
Female patients
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy while they
are receiving TMZ, and for at least 6 months following completion of treatment.
Male patients
Men being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child for at least 3 months after
receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see
section 4.6).
Sodium
This medicinal product contains 55.2 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 2.8 % of the WHO
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. This should be taken into
consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the
extent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl
triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). 
25
Based on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of
dexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or
phenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated
with a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.
No studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of
other medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low
protein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
(see section 5.2).
Use of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of
myelosuppression. 
Paediatric population
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy
There are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2
TMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). 
Temodal should not be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered,
the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued
while receiving treatment with TMZ. 
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy while they
are receiving TMZ, and for at least 6 months following completion of treatment.
Male fertility
TMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should use effective
contraceptive measures and be advised not to father a child for at least 3 months after receiving the
last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment, because of the possibility
of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
TMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see
section 4.8).
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical trial experience with hard capsules
In patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea,
vomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic adverse
26
reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is presented after
Table 4.
For patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually
Grade 1 or 2 (0 – 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily
controlled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed
in Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency
groupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); Common
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare
(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency
grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

† Including cases with fatal outcome
Newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
Laboratory results 
Myelosuppression (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), which is known dose-limiting toxicity for
most cytotoxic agents, including TMZ, was observed. When laboratory abnormalities and adverse
events were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4
neutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3
or Grade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of
the patients who received TMZ. 
Recurrent or progressive malignant glioma
Laboratory results
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients
treated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and
4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the
nadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of
cumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk
of bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.
29
Gender
In a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and
169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male
subjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4
neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9 % vs 3 %, in
women vs men in the first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4
neutropenia occurred in 8 % of female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 %
of female vs 3 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly–
diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male
subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of
therapy.
Paediatric population
Oral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or
recurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although
the data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in
children under the age of 3 years has not been established.
Clinical trial experience with IV
Temodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for solution for infusion delivers equivalent TMZ dose and exposure to
both TMZ and its active metabolite MTIC as the corresponding Temodal hard capsules (see
section 5.2). Adverse reactions reported during the two studies with the intravenous formulation
(n=35) but not in studies using hard capsules, were infusion site reactions: pain, irritation, pruritus,
warmth, swelling, and erythema, as well as haematoma.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
Doses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated
clinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is
expected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle,
over 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia,
multi-organ failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for
more than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow
suppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In
the event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be
provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03
Mechanism of action
Temozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the
active monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to
30
be due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at
the N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of
the methyl adduct.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
A total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286).
Patients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day
of RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by
monotherapy TMZ (150 - 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting
4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.
TMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in
the RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm.
The hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank
p < 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % vs
10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ
monotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated
a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1).

Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (Intent to treat population)
The results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance
status (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms.
However, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.
Recurrent or progressive malignant glioma
Data on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status
[KPS]  70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral
TMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the
other was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 %
received prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint
31
was progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the
non-comparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was
2.1 months, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on
MRI scans was 8 %.
In the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than
for procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively – chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and
1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for
TMZ and procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving
patients was significantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %)
(chi-square p = 0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a
KPS ≥ 80.
Data on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time
to worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The
median times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for
procarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03). 
Recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma
In a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the
treatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The
median PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the
central reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT)
n=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT
population was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results
for the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were
similar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was
strongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life.
Paediatric population
Oral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or
recurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance
to TMZ is similar to adults.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
TMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species,
3- methyl(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to
5amino-imidazole4carboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis,
and to methylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of
MTIC is thought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of
guanine. Relative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %,
respectively. In vivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.
In an open-label, two-way crossover bioequivalence study of the pharmacokinetics of oral and
intravenous TMZ in patients with primary CNS malignancies, Temodal 2.5 mg/ml powder for solution
for infusion administered over 90 minutes was found to be bioequivalent for Cmax and AUC of TMZ
and MTIC as compared to Temodal hard capsules, following administration of 150 mg/m2 dose. Mean
Cmax values for TMZ and MTIC were 7.4 µg/ml and 320 ng/ml, respectively, following 90 minute
intravenous infusion. Mean AUC (0 →  ) values for TMZ and MTIC were 25 µg•h/ml and
1,004 ng•h/ml, respectively.
32
Absorption
After oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached
as early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral
administration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 %
indicating complete absorption.
Distribution
TMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with
highly protein-bound substances.
PET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly
and is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on
AUC of TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data. 
Elimination
The half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal.
Following oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the
urine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid,
5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.
Plasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and
half-life are independent of dose. 
Special populations
Analysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was
independent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma
pharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those
observed in patients with normal hepatic function.
Paediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Single-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in
rats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system,
testes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and
dogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility,
except for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because
the doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect
has been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.
TMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and
dog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs.
Dose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A
variety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell
adenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were
evident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the
occurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even
for an alkylating agent.
Results of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome
aberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response.
33
The intravenous formulation produced local irritation at the site of injection in both rabbits and rats.
The irritation was transient and not associated with lasting tissue damage.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What Temodal is and what it is used for
Temodal contains a medicine called temozolomide. This medicine is an antitumour agent.
Temodal is used for the treatment of specific forms of brain tumours:
- 
in adults with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Temodal is first used together with
radiotherapy (concomitant phase of treatment) and after that alone (monotherapy phase of
treatment).
in children 3 years and older and adult patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma
multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. Temodal is used in these tumours if they return or get
worse after standard treatment.
2.  What you need to know before you take Temodal
Do not take Temodal
- 
if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in
section 6).
if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called
DTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include feeling itchy, breathlessness or wheezing, swelling of
the face, lips, tongue or throat.
if certain kinds of blood cells are severely reduced (myelosuppression), such as your white
blood cell count and platelet count. These blood cells are important for fighting infection and
for proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you have enough of
these cells before you begin treatment.
- 
- 
- 
63
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temodal,
- 
as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection
called Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you are a newly-diagnosed patient
(glioblastoma multiforme) you may be receiving Temodal for 42 days in combination with
radiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this type
of pneumonia (PCP).
if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temodal could
cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be
carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started.
if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood
clotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your
doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change your treatment. You may also
need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop treatment with Temodal. Your
blood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temodal on your
blood cells.
as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia.
if you have nausea (feeling sick in your stomach) and/or vomiting which are very common side
effects of Temodal (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) to
help prevent vomiting. 
If you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take
Temodal until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do not take a
second dose on the same day. 
if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection, contact your doctor immediately.
if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infections, bruising or
bleeding.
if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temodal may need to be adjusted.

Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is
limited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temodal. 
Other medicines and Temodal
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with
Temodal during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor.
Effective contraceptive precautions must be taken by female patients who are able to become pregnant
during treatment with Temodal, and for at least 6 months following completion of treatment.
You should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temodal.
Male fertility
Temodal may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception and not
father a child for at least 3 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on
conservation of sperm prior to treatment.
Driving and using machines
Temodal may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or machines or
cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4).
64
Temodal contains lactose
This medicine contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Temodal contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
3.  How to take Temodal
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Dosage and duration of treatment
Your doctor will work out your dose of Temodal. This is based on your size (height and weight) and if
you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. 
You may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking Temodal to
prevent or control nausea and vomiting.
Patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme:
If you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: 
- 
treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first
- 
followed by treatment with only Temodal (monotherapy phase).
During the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temodal at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual dose). You
will take this dose every day for 42 days (up to 49 days) in combination with radiotherapy. The
Temodal dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your
medicine during the concomitant phase.
Once the radiotherapy is completed, you will interrupt treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your body
a chance to recover.
Then, you will start the monotherapy phase.
During the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temodal will be different. Your doctor will
work out your exact dose. There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts 28 days.
You will take your new dose of Temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days (“dosing days”) of each
cycle. The first dose will be 150 mg/m2. Then you will have 23 days without Temodal. This adds up to
a 28-day treatment cycle. 
After Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again take Temodal once daily for 5 days followed
by 23 days without Temodal. The Temodal dose may be adjusted, delayed or stopped depending on
your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each treatment cycle.
Patients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma
multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking Temodal only:
A treatment cycle with Temodal lasts 28 days. 
You will take Temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on whether or not
you have received chemotherapy before.
If you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temodal will be
200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with chemotherapy,
your first dose of Temodal will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days.
Then, you will have 23 days without Temodal. This adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle.
After Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temodal once daily for 5 days,
followed by 23 days without Temodal.
65
Before each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temodal dose needs to be
adjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the next cycle.
How to take Temodal
Take your prescribed dose of Temodal once a day, preferably at the same time each day.
Take the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat
breakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew the
capsules. If a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. If you
accidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water. 
Depending on the prescribed dose, you may have to take more than one capsule together, eventually
with different strengths (content of active substance, in mg). The colour of the capsule cap is different
for each strength (see in the table below). 
Strength
Colour of the cap

You should make sure you fully understand and remember the following:
• 
how many capsules you need to take every dosing day. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to write it
down (including the colour). 
which days are your dosing days.
• 
Review the dose with your doctor each time you start a new cycle, since it may be different from the
last cycle.
Always take Temodal exactly as your doctor has told you. It is very important to check with your
doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Errors in how you take this medicine may have serious health
consequences. 
If you take more Temodal than you should
If you accidentally take more Temodal capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, pharmacist
or nurse immediately.
If you forget to take Temodal
Take the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. If a full day has gone by, check with
your doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you to
do so.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

4. 
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following:
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
a severe allergic (hypersensitive) reaction (hives, wheezing or other breathing difficulty),
uncontrolled bleeding, 
seizures (convulsions),
fever, 
chills,
severe headache that does not go away.
Temodal treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause you to have
increased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced resistance
to infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may be
prolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will monitor
your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In some
cases, your Temodal dose will be reduced or treatment stopped.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What Temodal is and what it is used for
Temodal contains a medicine called temozolomide. This medicine is an antitumour agent.
Temodal is used for the treatment of specific forms of brain tumours:
- 
in adults with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Temodal is first used together with
radiotherapy (concomitant phase of treatment) and after that alone (monotherapy phase of
treatment).
in children 3 years and older and adult patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma
multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. Temodal is used in these tumours if they return or get
worse after standard treatment.
2.  What you need to know before you use Temodal
Do not use Temodal
- 
if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in
section 6).
if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called
DTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include feeling itchy, breathlessness or wheezing, swelling of
the face, lips, tongue or throat.
if certain kinds of blood cells are severely reduced (myelosuppression), such as your white
blood cell count and platelet count. These blood cells are important for fighting infection and
for proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you have enough of
these cells before you begin treatment.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Temodal,
- 
as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection
called Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you are a newly-diagnosed patient
(glioblastoma multiforme) you may be receiving Temodal for 42 days in combination with
radiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this type
of pneumonia (PCP).
if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temodal could
cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be
carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started.
72
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood
clotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your
doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change your treatment. You may also
need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop treatment with Temodal. Your
blood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temodal on your
blood cells.
as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia.
if you have nausea (feeling sick in your stomach) and/or vomiting which are very common side
effects of Temodal (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) to
help prevent vomiting. 
if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection, contact your doctor immediately.
if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infections, bruising or
bleeding.
if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temodal may need to be adjusted.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is
limited information in patients over 3 years of age who have used Temodal.
Other medicines and Temodal
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or
pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with
Temodal during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor.
Effective contraceptive precautions must be taken by female patients who are able to become pregnant
during treatment with Temodal, and for at least 6 months following completion of treatment.
You should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temodal.
Male fertility
Temodal may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception and not
father a child for at least 3 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on
conservation of sperm prior to treatment.
Driving and using machines
Temodal may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or machines or
cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4).
Temodal contains sodium
This medicine contains 55.2 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is
equivalent to 2.8 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.  
3.  How to use Temodal
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Your doctor will work out your dose of Temodal. This is based on your size (height and weight) and if
you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. 
You may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after receiving Temodal to
prevent or control nausea and vomiting.
73
Patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme:
If you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: 
- 
treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first
- 
followed by treatment with only Temodal (monotherapy phase).
During the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temodal at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual dose). You
will receive this dose every day for 42 days (up to 49 days) in combination with radiotherapy. The
Temodal dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your
medicine during the concomitant phase.
Once the radiotherapy is completed, you will interrupt treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your body
a chance to recover.
Then, you will start the monotherapy phase.
During the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you receive Temodal in this phase will be different.
Your doctor will work out your exact dose.
There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts 28 days.
You will receive your new dose of Temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days of each cycle. The
first dose will be 150 mg/m2. Then you will have 23 days without Temodal. This adds up to a 28-day
treatment cycle. 
After Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temodal once daily for 5 days
followed by 23 days without Temodal. 
The Temodal dose may be adjusted, delayed or stopped depending on your blood counts and how you
tolerate your medicine during each treatment cycle.
Patients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma
multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) receiving Temodal only:
A treatment cycle with Temodal lasts 28 days. 
You will receive Temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on whether or
not you have received chemotherapy before.
If you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temodal will be
200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with chemotherapy,
your first dose of Temodal will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days.
Then, you will have 23 days without Temodal. This adds up to a 28 day treatment cycle.
After Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temodal once daily for 5 days,
followed by 23 days without Temodal.
Before each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temodal dose needs to be
adjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the next cycle.
How Temodal is given
Temodal will be given to you by your doctor in a drip into a vein (intravenous infusion), only over
approximately 90 minutes. No infusion site other than a vein is acceptable.
If you use more Temodal than you should
Your medicine is given to you by health care professionals. It is therefore unlikely that you will
receive more Temodal than you should. However, if you do, the doctor or nurse will treat you
accordingly.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

4. 
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following:
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
a severe allergic (hypersensitive) reaction (hives, wheezing or other breathing difficulty), 
uncontrolled bleeding, 
seizures (convulsions), 
fever, 
chills,
severe headache that does not go away.
Temodal treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause you to have
increased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced resistance
to infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may be
prolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will monitor
your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In some
cases, your Temodal dose will be reduced or treatment stopped.

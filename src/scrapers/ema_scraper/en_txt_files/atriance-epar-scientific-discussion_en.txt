SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1. 
Introduction 
T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) 
ALL  and  LBL  are  aggressive  diseases  that  progress  rapidly  to  a  fatal  outcome  in  the  absence  of 
effective  therapy.  LBL  is  commonly  considered  the  lymphomatous  variant  of  ALL  in  which 
extramedullary disease predominates in the presence of lesser involvement (< 25% marrow blasts) of 
the  bone  marrow  compared  with  ALL.  LBL  represents  approximately  30%  of  childhood  and  3%  of 
adult  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL).  An  important  subset  of  ALL  and  LBL  is  the  T-cell  lineage 
form  of  the  disease  (T-ALL  and  T-LBL,  respectively)  which  is  less  frequent  than  B-cell  lineage 
disease.  The  T-cell  phenotype  occurs  in  approximately  15-20%  of  children  and  25%  of  adults  with 
ALL and in approximately 10-20% of patients with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Current treatment for 
patients with T-LBL follows the same treatment strategy for T-ALL, with comparable results. 
Newly  diagnosed  ALL  and  LBL  patients  are  typically  treated  with  induction  therapy  consisting 
minimally of vincristine, prednisone, and anthracycline with or without asparaginase. Utilising modern 
risk adapted treatment plans in these patients; the  complete response  (CR) rate is > 95% in children 
and 60-80% in adults. Induction therapy is followed by additional cycles of multi-agent chemotherapy 
incorporating substances of different drug classes with the aim of long term disease control. The T-cell 
lineage  forms  of  the  disease  (T-ALL  and  T-LBL)  are  considered  high  risk  diseases  requiring  more 
aggressive  therapy.  Approximately  25-30%  of  children  experience  relapse  or  is  refractory  to  initial 
induction  therapy  with  a  resultant  poor  prognosis.  Children  who  relapse  within  6  months  of 
completion of initial therapy exhibit a 10% to 20% likelihood of long-term survival when treated with 
chemotherapy alone while those who relapse at over one year from completion of therapy have a 30% 
to 40% probability of long-term survival. The cure rate of T-ALL and T-LBL in adults is lower than in 
children. After first CR the majority of adult patients will eventually experience relapse.   
Treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL and T-LBL 
Therapy of patients with relapsed or refractory disease is largely individualised based on the nature of 
response to prior therapy (e.g., achieve CR or not, timing of relapse following CR, total anthracycline 
dose received, any agent specific toxicity). No consensus for therapy has emerged. Clofarabine is the 
only currently approved agent in Europe for single-agent therapy in relapsed or refractory paediatric 
ALL  (Commission  decision  dated  29  May  2006).  However,  most  patients  with  first  relapse  will 
receive  multi-agent  combination  re-induction  therapy,  which  has  demonstrated  complete  remission 
rates above 80% and ranging from 30-76% in clinical trials in children and adults, respectively. Even 
if  achieving  a  second  remission,  patients  have  a  poor  prognosis  when  treated  with  chemotherapy 
alone.  Thus,  these  patients  are  recommended  for  reinduction  chemotherapy  followed  by  allogeneic 
bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or stem cell transplantation for those who have an HLA-matched 
donor or autologous transplantation for those who do not. Long-term event free survival rates as high 
as 70% have been reported in children after BMT, whereas the probability for long-term survival in 
adult  patients  with  relapsed  ALL  is  lower,  even  with  BMT.  Therefore,  the  benefit  of  any  new 
antileukaemic  agent  must  be  assessed  in  the  context  that  only  CR  or  at  least  a  very  substantial 
reduction in leukaemic blasts would be of therapeutic interest and that achievement of CR should be 
followed by additional chemotherapy and/or BMT when feasible. 
There  are  only  limited  available  data  on  patients  who  have  relapsed  or  refractory  disease  following 
two or more prior induction attempts. No randomized trials have been performed in either paediatric or 
adult  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  T-ALL/T-LBL.  Patients  in  second  relapse  would  normally 
have received at least two multi agent chemotherapy regimens without having reached a sufficiently 
stable  remission  of  their  disease.  In  many  cases,  all  established  treatment  options  would  have  been 
exhausted. 
About the product 
Atriance contains nelarabine, an antineoplastic agent that acts as DNA synthesis inhibitor (ATC code: 
then 
L01BB07).  Nelarabine 
the  deoxyguanosine  analogue  ara-G  and 
is  demethylated 
to

© EMEA 2007 
 
phosphorylated  intracellularly  to  the  active  triphosphate  ara-GTP.  Accumulation  of  ara-GTP  in 
leukaemic blasts and incorporation into DNA leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death.  
The acronyms used during the development of the medicinal product were nelarabine, coded 506U78 
and GI262250. 
2.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Atriance is presented as a solution for infusion containing 5 mg of nelarabine (active substance) per 
ml. The excipients used in the preparation of Atriance are all well known excipients used in 
intravenous preparations such as sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and water for 
injections. 
Atriance is a clear, colourless solution containing 5 mg/ml of nelarabine filled into clear glass vials. 
Each vial contains 250 mg of nelarabine. 
Active Substance 
The active substance is a pro-drug of the deoxyguanosine derivative 9-β-D-arabinofuranosylguanine 
(ara-G), which converts initially to ara-G in vivo and subsequently converts to the active 5’-
triphosphate (ara-GTP). 
Nelarabine is chemically designated as 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyl-6-methoxy-9H-purin-2-amine (CAS) 
or 2-amino-9-β-D-arabinofuranosyl-6-methoxy-9H-purine (IUPAC). The structure of nelarabine is 
shown in figure 1.

Nelarabine is an ampholyte with an aqueous solubility of 8-9 mg/ml at 25°C over the pH range of 4 to 
10.  Its pKa is 2.5 and 12.1. It is a white to slightly colored, non-hygroscopic solid. There is only one 
known crystalline form of nelarabine, a crystalline anhydrate (non-solvate). Although it contains four 
adjacent chiral atoms in the sugar moiety, the route of synthesis is stereo-selective and therefore only 
one stereoisomer is synthesized. The median particle size volume diameter is in the range of 10-100 
micrometers. 
Since the drug product is a solution, solid-state and bulk properties of the drug substance have no 
impact on the drug product performance. 
•  Manufacture 
Nelarabine is synthesised in one step from two starting materials followed by a purification step. 
Confirmation of the chemical structure of nelarabine was provided by elemental analysis and 
spectroscopic analysis of a large-scale batch from the proposed commercial route of nelarabine. The 
results from infrared spectroscopy, proton and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrum, and 
single crystal x-ray crystallography confirmed the proposed chemical structure.

•  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, identification (IR spectroscopy), 
assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), water content (Karl Fisher), residue on ignition, specific optical 
rotation, residual protein (UV spectroscopy) and bacterial endotoxins. 
The method for identification of nelarabine by IR was validated for specificity, the HPLC method for 
assay of nelarabine and impurities was validated for specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, 
robustness, stability and detection limit. No validation was performed for the methods described in the 
PhEur. 
Data was provided on one pilot scale batch and three production scale batches manufactured according 
to the proposed manufacturing process. In addition, data were also provided on 20 batches 
manufactured according to the previous routes of synthesis, used in the non-clinical and clinical 
studies.  All the batches complied with the requirements in the active substance specification. 
•  Stability 
Three production scale batches were stored at 30oC/65% RH for 24 months (long term storage 
conditions) and at 40oC/75% for 6 months (accelerated conditions). Additionally, photostability was 
presented for one batch of active substance manufactured at pilot. No significant changes were 
observed on storage. 
The stability studies showed that the active substance is stable and confirm the proposed re-test period.  
Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
Initially the product was developed as lyophilized solid nelarabine. Each vial contained 200 mg of 
active substance in the form of sterile powder to be reconstituted with water for injections. The 
formulation was then further developed into a ready-to-use liquid injectable dosage form. The 
solubility of nelarabine in water and in sodium chloride was investigated. The effects of pH, light, 
temperature and terminal sterilization on the aqueous solution of nelarabine were also evaluated. 
Based on the results a 5 mg/ml solution of nelarabine in sodium chloride was prepared and the 
stability of this formulation was monitored. Sodium chloride was used to adjust the tonicity of the 
formulation and sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid were used to adjust the pH. 
•  Adventitious Agents 
None of the excipients used in the formulation of nelarabine solution for infusion are of animal origin. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process for nelarabine solution for infusion comprises (1) mixing of nelarabine, 
sodium chloride and water for injections (2) Filtration (3) pH adjustment (4) second filtration (5) 
filling of the solution into sterile vials (6) terminal sterilisation by a cycle which is F0 controlled. 
There are several in-process controls such as the determination of the bioburden prior to filtration, 
determination of the pH prior to filling, testing of the integrity of the sterilising filter pre- and post-
filtration and the check of the fill weight at regular intervals throughout the filling operation. 
The manufacturing process validation has been performed using three production scale batches. The 
nelarabine content and pH at key stages in the manufacturing process was evaluated. The results 
showed that the manufacturing process delivers the appropriate concentration and that no losses in 
content are seen at any point during the transfer, filtration or filling of the solution into vials. The 
steam sterilisation process was validated by performing heat penetration temperature monitoring in 
association with a bacterial spore challenge.   
The manufacturing process was adequately validated. Batch analysis data on three production scale 
batches confirmed that the defined process reliably produces product which meets the proposed 
release specification.

•  Product Specification 
The specification for nelarabine solution for infusion include tests for appearance (visual 
examination), identification of nelarabine (UV and HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
extractable volume, particulate contamination, pH, bacterial endotoxin and sterility.  
All methods have been satisfactorily validated. The HPLC method was validated for specificity, 
linearity, accuracy, range, precision, robustness, stability and detection limits. The method for 
determination of the endotoxin in nelarabine was validated as well as the sterility test. All other 
methods are described in the PhEur and therefore validation was deemed to be unnecessary.  
•  Stability of the Product 
Stability data were provided on four batches of drug product manufactured at the commercial site 
using the commercial process at production scale. The batches were stored at 30oC/65% RH for 24 
months (long term storage conditions) and at 40oC/75% for 6 months (accelerated conditions) in the 
proposed packaging. The parameters assessed were the appearance, pH, bacterial endotoxins, sterility, 
extractable volume, assay, impurities and particulate contamination. Additionally, stability data for 
one batch exposed to light and freeze/thaw conditions was also provided. The results of all studies 
complied with the product specification in all batches and no changes were observed under 
photostability stress or freeze/thaw conditions. 
In summary, the stability results support the shelflife and storage conditions as defined in the SPC. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance and finished product have been adequately described. The excipients used in the 
preparation of the finished product and the manufacturing process selected are typical of an 
intravenous preparation. The results of the tests indicate that the active substance and the finished 
product can be reproducibility manufactured and therefore the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance.   
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve 
this as a Follow Up Measure after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe. 
3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The pharmacology of nelarabine was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Except for a single-dose toxicity 
study  in  monkey,  all  pivotal  non-clinical  safety  studies  were  carried  out  in  compliance  with  GLP 
standards, as claimed by the applicant. 
Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
The  pharmacodynamics of nelarabine has  been characterized in  vitro, in human leukaemic cell lines 
and in vivo, in a mouse tumour model. 
The in-vitro potency and selectivity of cytotoxicity of nelarabine and ara-G have been investigated in a 
range  of  human  haematopoietic  cell  lines.  In  these  assays,  the  IC50  for  cytotoxicity  in  human  T-cell 
lines  ranged  from  0.31  to  4.4 μM  for  nelarabine  and  from  0.31  to  5.0 μM  for  ara-G  (see  Table  1). 
Generally, the IC50 values for cytotoxicity in B-cells with nelarabine and ara-G were at least 20-fold 
higher  (>200 μM and >100 μM, respectively, with the  exception of one study where the IC50 values 
were >10 μM, the maximum tested concentration), and for monocyte (THP-1) cells were >50 μM. In 
malignant  haematopoietic  cell  lines  of  T-cell  lineage,  (CEM,  HSB,  and  dCK  deficient  cell  line, 
ACO611a),  a  B-cell  line  (WIL-2),  and  a  stem  cell  line  (DU528)  exposed  to  varying  concentrations 
(50,  100,  200  or  500 μM)  of  either  agent  for  4  or  24 hours  and  incubated  at  37°C  for  2  to  3 weeks, 
treatment with nelarabine or ara-G resulted in comparable, concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and

inhibition  of  subsequent  outgrowth  of  malignant  T-cells  (see  Table  2).  T-cells  deficient  in  dCK 
(AC0611a) and haematopoietic cell lines of stem cell or B-cell lineage did not show any substantial 
sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of nelarabine or ara-G.

The  role  of  ADA  in  the  conversion  of  nelarabine  to  ara-G  was  investigated  in  similar  assays  using 
human leukaemic cell lines (CEM, MOLT-4, CEM-CD4+, U937 and IM-9) treated with nelarabine or 
ara-G (up to 200 μM). In the absence of ADA inhibitors, growth inhibition of human T-cell lines was 
observed  with  IC50  values  of  0.31  to  3.4 μM  for  nelarabine  and  0.31  to  5.0 μM  for  ara-G.  In  the 
presence  of  ADA  inhibitors,  there  was  a  concentration-dependent  increase  in  the  IC50  values  of 
nelarabine for growth inhibition of T-cell lines. At the highest ADA inhibitor concentration of 10 μM, 
there  was  a  >7-fold  increase  in  IC50  values  of  nelarabine.  The  increased  IC50  values  were  noted  for 
growth  inhibition  of  both  T-cell  lines  and  macrophage/monocyte  cell  line  (U937)  sensitive  to 
nelarabine,  but  not  for  the  IM-9  B-cell  line.  In  contrast,  ara-G,  in  the  presence  of  ADA  inhibitors, 
retained its inhibitory activity with almost no change in IC50 values (0.31 to 5.0 μM), thus confirming 
the conversion of nelarabine to ara-G. 
Further in vitro studies of the role of ADA and the interaction of nelarabine and ara-G with adenosine 
kinase (AK), dGK, and dCK were conducted using purified mammalian enzymes. Ara-G was a good 
substrate for phosphorylation by dCK and dGK. In contrast, phosphorylation of nelarabine by dCK 
was not detected. Nelarabine was phosphorylated by mitochondrial dGK, but only at a low rate (4% of 
ara-G). Neither nelarabine nor ara-G was phosphorylated by AK.

The  effects  of  nelarabine  on  intracellular  ara-GTP  formation  was  investigated  in  malignant  CEM 
CD4+  T-cells  incubated  with  3H-nelarabine  or  3H-ara-G  in  the  presence  or  absence  of  the  ADA 
inhibitor dCF. Nelarabine and ara-G caused comparable intracellular accumulation of ara-GTP (54.7 
and  55.9  pmol/106  cells,  respectively)  whereas  the  ADA  inhibitor  blocked  ara-GTP  accumulation 
induced  by  nelarabine  (6.9  pmol/106  cells),  but  not  by  ara-G  (65.1  pmol/106  cells),  suggesting  that 
nelarabine  is  converted  to  ara-G  at  the  nucleoside  or  the  nucleoside  monophosphate  level.  No 
phosphates  of  nelarabine  were  detected  in  these  assays  at  the  limit  of  quantification  of  1  pmol/106 
cells. Analysis of the media showed that 13% of nelarabine was converted to ara-G in the absence of 
dCF.  Additionally,  nelarabine  was  stable  in  media  only  in  the  presence  of  dCF,  whereas  ara-G  was 
stable  in  the  media  in  the  presence  or  absence  of  dCF.  The  ability  of  ara-G  to  cause  ara-GTP 
accumulation was also studied in normal bone marrow precursor cells and in malignant B- and T-cell 
lines, including the dCK-deficient derivative ACO611a cell line. In these studies, ara-G was found to 
cause ara-GTP accumulation in both T-cells and B-cells. However, intracellular ara-GTP levels were 
20- to 40- fold higher in T-cells than in B-cells and ara-GTP was degraded much more rapidly in B-
cells, resulting in sustained high concentrations of ara-GTP in T-cells. Ara-GTP accumulation in the -
dCK  ACO611a  cell  line  was  low,  suggesting  that  in  addition  to  dGK,  dCK  is  involved  in  the 
phosphorylation  of  ara-G  to  ara-GTP.  Ara-GTP  accumulation  was  also  low  in  normal  marrow 
precursor bone cells and significant toxicity to these cells occurred only at very high concentrations of 
ara-G (1000 μM). 
The  effects  of  ara-G  on  DNA  polymerase  activity  have  been  studied.  Ara-GTP  caused  inhibition  of 
DNA polymerase α, β, δ, ε, and γ, in that order of sensitivity, relative to Km for dGTP (Ratio Ki:Km), 
indicating that although ara-G can be phosphorylated by mitochondrial dGK, it is not likely to inhibit 
mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.  
In  vivo,  duplicate  studies  determined  the  effect  of  nelarabine  and  ara-G  on  growth  inhibition  of 
implanted  tumour  cells  in  nude  SCID  mice  injected  SC  with  107  CEM  (malignant  T-cell  line) 
cells/mouse. The day after tumour implant, the mice (n=3 to 8/group), were administered either PO or 
IP, daily doses of nelarabine at 150 or 300 mg/m2 (50 or 100 mg/kg) for 25 consecutive days, or ara-G 
at 300 mg/m2 (100 mg/kg) PO for 25 consecutive days or ara-G, PO, twice daily doses of 300 mg/m2 
(100 mg/kg) for a total dose of 600 mg/m2/day (200 mg/kg/day) for 10 days. Euthanasia and tumour 
removal  were  carried  out  64  to  68  days  after  tumour  transplant.  Solid  tumours  were  visible  30 days 
after implantation in the control group. Tumour growth inhibition by nelarabine was dose-dependent 
with  approximately  72%  to  94%  inhibition  of  implanted  tumour  cell  growth  following  PO  or  IP 
administration  at  doses  ≥150  mg/m2/day  for  25  days.  PO  administration  of  ara-G  once  daily  for  25 
days  was  equally  effective  in  inhibition  of  implanted  tumour  cell  growth  in  mice  compared  to  the 
twice daily PO administration of ara-G for 600 mg/m2/day for 10 days, with tumour weights of 11.3 
and 7.1 % of control, respectively. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Limited in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that nelarabine and ara-G have antiviral properties against 
certain DNA viruses such as varicella zoster, cowpox and herpes simplex viruses.  
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
No pharmacodynamic safety studies were performed. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed. 
Pharmacokinetics 
•  Absorption-Bioavailability  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  nelarabine  and  ara-G  were  studied  in  vivo  in  the  mouse  and  cynomolgus 
monkey  using  IV  administration.  Human  in  vitro  systems  were  employed  to  determine  the  potential 
for interactions with plasma proteins, P-glycoprotein-mediated transport and cytochrome P450.

In all species, elimination of nelarabine from plasma occurred more rapidly than that of ara-G. Also, 
exposure  to  ara-G  was  greater  than  exposure  to  nelarabine  in  all  species  except  in  the  rat.  The  PK 
parameters  observed  in  the  monkey  showed  the  greatest  similarity  to  those  observed  in  humans.  No 
difference  was  observed  in  plasma  exposure  to  nelarabine  or  ara-G  between  day  1  and  day  3  when 
nelarabine was administered IV to monkeys twice daily at a dose of 300 mg/m2/dose. For both day 1 
and day 3, systemic exposure to ara-G was approximately 6.5-fold higher than exposure to nelarabine 
(see table 3). In the 5- and 30-day toxicity studies, exposure was comparable between days 1 and 5 in 
the  5-day  study  and  between  days  3  and  28  of  the  30-day  study.  There  was  no  evidence  for 
accumulation of nelarabine or ara-G. No substantial gender-related differences were observed.

•  Distribution 
The  tissue  distribution  of  14C-nelarabine-related  radioactivity  was  assessed  in  male  and  female 
pigmented  mice  following  a  single  IV  infusion  of  14C-nelarabine  (300 mg/m2),  using  whole  body 
autoradiography. The 14C-related material was rapidly and widely distributed into the tissues. In most 
tissues,  the  concentrations  of  radioactivity  were  highest  immediately  after  the  end  of  the  infusion 
period  (10  minutes).  Tissues  with  high  levels  of  radioactivity  were  kidney,  gall  bladder,  liver  and 
spleen. Low levels of radioactivity were measured in the central nervous system and were generally at 
the  limit  of  quantification  (0.28 µg eq  of  nelarabine/g)  by  14  days  after  dosing.  No  selective 
association  of  14C-nelarabine-related  radioactivity  with  melanin-containing  tissues  was  observed. 
Radioactivity declined relatively slowly (quantifiable levels at 35 days after dosing).

•  Metabolism 
The  in  vitro  metabolism  of  nelarabine  and  ara-G  was  investigated  by  incubating  the  14C-labelled 
molecules with mouse, rabbit, monkey and human hepatocytes. In incubations of human hepatocytes 
with  nelarabine,  the  metabolites  observed  were  ara-G,  uric  acid,  xanthine  and  allantoin.  Similarly, 
following  incubations  with  ara-G,  uric  acid,  xanthine  and  allantoin  were  observed.  In  general, 
metabolites  observed  in  human  hepatocytes  were  also  observed  in  the  mouse,  rabbit  or  monkey 
hepatocytes. 
The  in  vivo  metabolism  of  nelarabine  was  investigated  in  male  and  female  mice  (300 mg/m2)  and 
cynomolgus monkeys (1200 mg/m2) after an IV administration of 14C-nelarabine. Selected samples of 
plasma,  urine, bile (male  mouse and  monkey only) and faeces  obtained from excretion studies  were 
analysed  using  radio-HPLC  and  LC/MS/MS  to  quantify  and  identify  the  major  metabolites  of 
nelarabine.  In  the  plasma  of  mice,  ara-G  and  allantoin  were  the  major  radioactive  components 
circulating  with  smaller  amounts  of  nelarabine  and  uric  acid.  In  the  monkey,  ara-G  was  the  major 
radioactive component circulating in plasma; nelarabine was a minor component. In mice, unchanged 
nelarabine  represented  approximately  22%  to  28%  of  the  administered  dose  in  urine,  ara-G 
approximately 19% to 22% and allantoin represented approximately 20% to 24% of the dose. Three 
other minor urinary metabolites, uric acid, guanine and xanthine, collectively accounted for less than 
3%  of  the  dose.  In  monkeys,  unchanged  nelarabine  represented  approximately  4  to  12%  of  the 
administered  dose  in  urine.  Ara-G  was  the  most  prominent  metabolite  in  urine,  accounting  for 
approximately  45  to  60%  of  the  administered  dose.  Two  minor  metabolites  observed  were  allantoin 
and xanthine. The metabolites detected in the faeces and bile were similar to those detected in urine 
but the amounts were very low and accounted for <6% of the total administered dose. In general, there 
were no notable differences in metabolic profile between males and females. 
•  Excretion 
Following IV administration of 14C-nelarabine to male and female mice (300 mg/m2) and cynomolgus 
monkeys  (1200 mg/m2);  the  predominant  route  of  excretion  was  via  the  urine  in  both  species  (62  to 
75% and 63 to 69% of the dose excreted by this route in mice and in monkey, respectively). Less than 
6% of the dose was excreted in the faeces and bile.  The majority of the recovered radioactivity was 
excreted  within  48  hours  in  mice  and  96  hours  in  monkeys.  For  the  mouse,  approximately  4%  of 
radioactivity remained in the carcasses at the end of the study (96 hours) indicating some retention of 
radioactivity in the body. Studies conducted in male bile duct cannulated animals revealed that biliary 
secretion  was  a  minor  route  of  elimination,  accounting  for  <2%  of  the  IV  dose  in  both  mice  and 
monkeys.  
•  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The protein binding of nelarabine and ara-G (6, 60 and 600 µM) was investigated in human plasma by 
ultrafiltration.  Low  binding  to  human  plasma  proteins  was  observed  for  both  nelarabine  (7.02  to 
19.6%)  and  ara-G  (9.78  to  24.4%).  When  incubated  with  pooled  human  liver  microsomes  in  vitro, 
nelarabine  and  ara-G  (up  to  100 μM)  did  not  inhibit  the  activities  of  the  major  human  hepatic 
cytochrome  P450  enzymes  (CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6 
and CYP3A4). Likewise, neither nelarabine nor ara-G (up to 300 μM) caused any apparent increase in 
mean  mRNA  expression  or  catalytic  activities  for  CYP1A2,  2B6  or  3A4 in  human  hepatocytes. 
In vitro,  no  inhibition  of  human  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp)-mediated  transport  was  observed  with  either 
nelarabine  or  ara-G  (up  to  100 µM).  Nelarabine  and  ara-G  were  not  substrates  for  human  P-gp  and 
both compounds showed low passive membrane permeability.

•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
The  potential  toxicity  of  nelarabine  was  investigated  in  repeat-dose  IV  studies  of  5  or  30  days 
duration. The 5-day studies were conducted in mice (600 to 1800 mg/m2/day) and in ketamine-sedated 
cynomolgus monkeys (720 to 3600 mg/m2/day). The 30-day study was carried out in the non-sedated 
monkey  (120  to  480 mg/m2/day).  The  dose  of  300  mg/kg/day  (3600  mg/m2/day)  was  chosen  as  the 
maximum dose in the final 5-day study (death of ketamine-sedated female monkeys observed in three 
non-GLP studies at 500 and 400 mg/kg, i.e. 6000 and 4800 mg/m2). The design of the final mouse and 
monkey studies is summarised in Table 5.

In  the  mouse  study,  decreased  activity  was  noted  in  a  majority  of  males  and  females  given 
600 mg/kg/day.  Shallow  breathing  and  ptosis  were  noted,  but  decreased  over  time.  The  onset  of  the 
clinical signs was approximately 2 to 26 minutes following dosing, with animals recovering by 1 to 5 
hours  after  dosing.  A  single  incidence  of  hypothermia  and  tremors  was  noted  in  one  male  given 
600 mg/kg/day.  One  female  given  500 mg/kg/day  died  on  post  dose  day  8  and  two  females  given 
600 mg/kg/day died by post dose  days 7. Dehydration, high carriage, and partially closed eyes were 
noted  prior  to  death.  Macroscopic  findings  of  red  lungs  and  tarry  material  in  stomach,  duodenum, 
jejunum, ileum, coecum and colon were noted in one female given 600 mg/kg/day and found dead on 
post  dose  day  5.  The  LD10,  LD50  and  LD90  values  calculated  from  this  study  for  males  and  females 
combined were 1638, 2170 and 2702 mg/m2/day, respectively. 
In the  monkey,  administration of  300 mg/kg/day of nelarabine for  5  consecutive  days caused  severe 
neurotoxicity that was lethal in 3 of 4 monkeys. An identical regimen of 150 mg/kg/day resulted in no 
mortality, but 2 of 4 monkeys showed reversible neurotoxicity. Reversible neurotoxicity was also seen 
in 3 of 4 monkeys given 60 mg/kg/day. Clinical signs in this group were moderate, but persisted 21, 
36 and 57 days into the post dose observation period. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity included seizures, 
convulsions,  muscle  tremor  and  weakness,  in-coordination,  ataxia,  depth  perception  deficits,  and 
unresponsiveness.  No  microscopic  lesions  were  observed  in  central  or  peripheral  nervous  system 
tissues to correlate with this observed neurotoxicity. Clear decreases in total white blood cell values, 
body weight, and food consumption were noted in all treated groups. Histopathological changes were 
seen in the high dose group, and were characterized by maturation arrest of intestinal epithelial cells 
and  depletion  of  lymphoid  organs,  reversible  in  surviving  animals.  Neurotoxicity  was  dose-limiting. 
Onset of clinical neurotoxicity was dose-dependant, beginning immediately after the dosing period in 
individual animals at the highest dose and as late as post dose day 10 and 13, in animals from the low 
9/44

and mid-dose groups, respectively. All signs of neurotoxicity were reversible at all dose levels tested. 
A no-effect level was not determined. 
In  the  30-day  study  in  non-sedated  monkeys,  neurotoxicity  manifested  clinically  after  19  doses  as 
coarse muscle tremors and seizures lasting about 30 seconds in 2 monkeys given 480 mg/m2/day and 
one monkey given 240 mg/m2/day. After 23 doses, 6 monkeys given 480 mg/m2/day and 2 monkeys 
given  240 mg/m2/day  had  tremors  and/or  seizures  and  dosing  was  stopped  for  the  480 mg/m2/day 
monkeys. During the recovery period, clinical signs were  completely reversible in the 20 mg/kg/day 
group,  but  only  partially  reversible  in  the  480 mg/m2/day  group.  Within  3  weeks  after  the  dosing 
period,  surviving  clinically  affected  monkeys  showed  improvement  as  muscle  tremors  lessened  and 
the general body condition improved. However, no further clinical improvement occurred during the 
rest of the recovery period. Laboratory findings comprised decreased RBC parameters, platelet counts, 
neutropenia  and  monocytopenia  and  reduced  cholesterol,  glucose  and  creatinine  levels  in  high-dose 
animals.  There  were  no  treatment-related  macroscopic  changes.  Neurotoxicity  that  was  evident 
clinically as tremors and seizures at 480 mg/m2/day was accompanied by histopathologic changes of 
white  matter  degeneration  and  vacuolation  in  brain  and  spinal  cord  in  3  of  the  10  monkeys.  These 
lesions occurred only at 480 mg/m2/day and persisted through the recovery period.  
In monkey, systemic exposure (AUC values) to nelarabine and ara-G were dose-proportional and did 
not  show  any  gender  differences;  neither  nelarabine  nor  ara-G  accumulated  over  the  dosing  period. 
Neurotoxicity was unrelated to nelarabine exposure, but generally correlated with greater exposure to 
ara-G.  
•  Genotoxicity 
The mutagenic potential of nelarabine at concentrations from 100 to 5000 μg/ml was investigated in 3 
hour  incubations  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  rat  liver  S9-mix  in  mouse  lymphoma  L5178Y/TK 
cells.  The  relative  total  growth  at  the  highest  concentration  of  5000  μg/mL  during  the  3-hour 
treatments was 14% (in the absence of S9-mix) and 11% (in the presence of S9-mix). Both small and 
large colony mutants were observed in cultures treated with nelarabine in the presence and absence of 
S9-mix, as well as in the positive controls. With nelarabine an increase in the frequency of both small 
and  large  colonies  was  observed.  The  increase  in  frequency  of  small  colonies  is  consistent  with 
damage to multiple loci on chromosome 11, in addition to loss of the TK locus.  
•  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with nelarabine. 
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies  assessing  effects  on  fertility  were  not  conducted  as  adverse  effects  on  fertility  would  be 
expected from the class of cytotoxic nucleoside analogue drugs. No undesirable effects were seen in 
the testes or ovaries of monkeys given nelarabine intravenously at doses up to approximately 32% of 
the adult human dose on an mg/m 2 basis for 30 consecutive days. 
A conventional embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study was conducted in the rabbit. As expected 
from its mechanism of action, nelarabine caused maternal and foetal toxicity when given to pregnant 
rabbits  as  an  8-hour  daily intravenous  infusion  at  doses  of  354,  1180  or  3540 mg/m2/day  during  the 
period  of  major  organogenesis.  Maternal  toxicity  was  seen  at  3540 mg/m2/day  as  evidenced  by 
mortality,  abortion,  adverse  clinical  signs,  decreased  body  weight  gains  and  corrected  body  weight 
gains  and  lower  food  consumption.  There  was  no  evidence  of  treatment-related  embryolethality. 
Foetotoxicity was evidenced at 3540 mg/m2/day by low foetal weights and at all levels by indications 
of  delayed  skeletal  ossification.  Increased  incidences  of  foetal  abnormalities  were  seen  in  all 
nelarabine-treated  groups,  including  cleft  palates  at  3540 mg/m2/day,  absent  pollices  at  doses 
≥1180 mg/m2/day  and  absent  gall  bladders,  accessory  lung  lobes  and  fused/extra  sternebrae  at  all 
doses.  Effects  at  354 mg/m2/day  were  thus  limited  to  increased  incidences  of  minor  anomalies  and 
common  skeletal  variants.  Toxicokinetic  data  were  obtained  in  the  course  of  this  study.  On  the  last 
day, the AUC in the low-dose group averaged 90.8 μM.h, corresponding to a safety margin of 0.2 in 
adult humans.

A segment III study and studies in juvenile animals were not conducted.  
•  Local tolerance  
Studies of local tolerance are limited to a haemolysis and protein flocculation study and a conventional 
eye irritation test (both negative). 
•  Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity: Nelarabine tested negative in a conventional guinea pig test for delayed hypersensitivity. 
No Immunotoxicity or dependence studies were conducted with nelarabine. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An evaluation of the potential risk to the environment from the storage, use and disposal of nelarabine 
has not been performed. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology  
is 
of 
the 
pro-drug 
analogue 
deoxyguanosine 
a  water-soluble 
Nelarabine 
9-β-D-
arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G). The IC50 for cytotoxicity in human T-cell lines ranged from 0.31 to 
4.4 μM for nelarabine and from 0.31 to 5.0 μM for ara-G. Generally, the IC50 values for cytotoxicity in 
B-cells  with  nelarabine  and  ara-G  were  at  least  20-fold  higher.  In  vivo,  proof  of  concept  was 
established in studies determining the effect of nelarabine and ara-G on growth inhibition of implanted 
malignant  T-cell  line  in  mice.  Tumour  growth  inhibition  by  nelarabine  was  dose-dependent  with 
approximately  72%  to  94%  inhibition  of  implanted  tumour  cell  growth  following  PO  or  IP 
administration of nelarabine at doses ≥150 mg/m2/day for 25 days. PO administration of ara-G once 
daily  for  25  days  was  equally  effective  in  inhibition  of  implanted  tumour  cell  growth  in  mice 
compared to the twice daily PO administration of ara-G for 600 mg/m2/day for 10 days, with tumour 
inhibition values of 89% and 93%, respectively. The mechanism of action was investigated in human 
leukaemic  cell  lines  treated  with  nelarabine  or  ara-G  in  the  absence  or  presence  of  adenosine 
deaminase  inhibitors,  or  using  purified  enzymes.  Taken  together,  these  studies  indicated  that 
nelarabine is demethylated by adenosine deaminase to form ara-G. Ara-G is then phosphorylated by 
cellular  dCK  or  dGK  to  ara-GMP,  which  on  subsequent  phosphorylation  is  converted  to  active  ara-
GTP.  Ara-GTP  accumulates  to  significantly  higher  levels  and  for  longer  duration  in  T-cells  than  in 
other  cell  types  including  B-cells  and  inhibits  DNA  synthesis  by  chain  termination  of  DNA 
polymerase  α,  β,  δ,  ε,  and  γ,  in  that  order,  leading  to  T-cell  death.  Limited  studies  of  secondary 
pharmacodynamics  revealed  no  clinically  relevant  findings.  Safety  pharmacology  studies  were  not 
conducted, as these are not required for cytotoxic anticancer drugs unless they have a novel mode of 
action  (ICH  S7A  Note  for  Guidance  on  safety  pharmacology  studies  for  human  pharmaceuticals 
CPMP/ICH/539/00,  16  November  2000).  No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were 
conducted, which was considered acceptable.  
Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of nelarabine and ara-G was studied in vivo in mice and cynomolgus monkeys 
using IV administration, which is the proposed clinical route. Human in vitro systems were employed 
to determine the potential for interactions with plasma proteins, P-glycoprotein-mediated transport and 
cytochrome P450. Validated methods of adequate sensitivity were used to quantify the concentrations 
of  nelarabine,  ara-G  and  14C-labelled  material  in  biological  samples.  Following  a  single  IV 
administration, the plasma half-life of nelarabine was shorter (30 minutes in the monkey) than that of 
ara-G  (about  4  hours  in  the  monkey)  and  systemic  exposure  to  ara-G  was  greater  than  exposure  to 
nelarabine  in  all  species,  except  in  rats.  In  monkeys  and  adult  humans,  the  plasma  half-life  of 
nelarabine was 30 and 17 minutes, respectively, and that of ara-G, 228 and 181 minutes, respectively. 
Following repeated IV administration of nelarabine, systemic exposures to both nelarabine and ara-G 
in  monkeys  were  generally  dose-proportional.  There  were  no  substantial  changes  in  exposures  over 
11/44

time, no evidence for accumulation of nelarabine or ara-G, and no apparent gender-related differences 
in  exposure  on  repeat  dosing  for  up  to  28  days  in  the  monkey.  Nelarabine  is  rapidly  and  widely 
distributed, followed by a slow elimination attributable to the incorporation of nucleotide metabolites 
into  nucleic  acids.  The  principal  metabolic  pathway  involves  the  O-demethylation  of  nelarabine  by 
adenosine deaminase to form ara-G. Hydrolysis of nelarabine and ara-G results in the formation of the 
naturally  occurring  purine  nucleotides  methylguanine  and  guanine,  respectively.  These  are  then  de-
methylated  and/or  de-aminated  to  xanthine  and  further  oxidized  to  uric  acid  and  allantoin.  Urinary 
excretion was the  major route of elimination of nelarabine, accounting for approximately 62 to 75% 
(mice)  and  63  to  69%  (monkey)  of  the  administered  dose.  Faecal  and  biliary  elimination  were  very 
minor routes of excretion in mice and monkeys (<6% of the administered dose). Excretion in milk was 
not  investigated.  At  concentrations  representative  of  those  in  human  plasma,  less  than  25%  protein 
binding of nelarabine or ara-G was observed, indicating that neither is substantially bound to human 
plasma proteins. Neither nelarabine nor ara-G was inhibitors or substrates for human P-gp. Nelarabine 
and ara-G showed little potential for inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes. Taken together, these studies suggest 
that nelarabine and ara-G are unlikely to interact with other drugs. 
Toxicology 
In  conventional  single-dose  toxicity  studies  using  IV  administration,  the  maximum  non-lethal  dose 
was 1800 mg/m2 in mice and 6000 mg/m2 in cynomolgus monkeys. The noteworthy clinical findings 
were reduced body weight gain in female mice and sedation in either species. 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies included 5-day studies in mice at doses of 600 to 1800 mg/m2/day and in 
ketamine-sedated cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 720 to 3600 mg/m2/day and a 30-day study in non-
sedated  monkeys  at  doses  of  120  to  480 mg/m2/day.  In  mice,  clinical  findings  comprised  tremors, 
decreased  activity  and  death.  Macroscopic  findings  were  either  negative  or  unspecific,  and 
histopathology  was  not  performed.  The  LD10,  LD50  and  LD90  values  calculated  from  this  study  for 
males  and  females  combined  were  1638,  2170  and  2702  mg/m2/day,  respectively.  In  monkeys,  the 
critical  effect  was  neurotoxicity  characterized  by  seizures,  muscle  tremor  and  weakness,  in-
coordination,  ataxia,  depth  perception  deficits  and  unresponsiveness,  which  occurred  in  males  and 
females given ≥720 mg/m2/day for 5 days or at ≥240 mg/m2/day for up to 30 days, but not in monkeys 
given 120 mg/m2/day for 30 days. Clinical neurotoxicity occurred earlier the higher the dose and was 
only  partially  reversible  at  480 mg/m2/day  given  for  23 days.  No  histopathologic  lesions  were 
observed in central or peripheral nervous system tissues of monkeys given nelarabine for 5 days, but 
white  matter  degeneration  and  vacuolation  in  brain  and  spinal  cord  were  noted  in  3  of  10  monkeys 
dosed  at  480 mg/m2/day  for  23  days.  These  CNS  lesions  occurred  only  at  480 mg/m2/day  and  were 
still present 2 months after dosing was stopped. Other main findings in the 5- and 30-day repeat-dose 
studies  in  monkeys  indicate  that  nelarabine  also  targets  the  mitotically  active  cells  in  bone  marrow, 
lymphoid  organs  and  intestinal  tract,  resulting  in  secondary  effects  whose  incidence  and  severity 
increased with time and dose. All of these reversed during recovery. One high dose female (out of 4 
animals  given  3600  mg/m2/day)  in  the  5-day  study  had  minimal  epicardial  fibrosis  and  minimal 
myocarditis. Mild multifocal degeneration of the myocardium was observed in 1 low dose male (out of 
6 animals) and in 1 mid dose female (out of 6 animals) and 1 high dose female (out of 10 animals) in 
the  30-day  study.  Similar  effects  were  not  observed  in  the  controls.  However,  since  neither  the 
frequency nor the severity of these effects correlated with exposure, they are unlikely to be treatment-
related (see SPC section 5.3). The repeat-dose mice study did not include toxicokinetics. In monkeys, 
AUC  values  for  both  nelarabine  and  ara-G  were  dose-proportional  and  showed  no  sex  difference  or 
signals  of  accumulation.  A  no-effect  level  was  not  determined  for  effects  attributable  to  toxicity  to 
mitotically  active  cells  in  bone  marrow,  lymphoid  organs  and  intestinal  tract.  The  NTEL  for 
neurotoxicity in the monkey was 120 mg/m2/day. Neurotoxicity was unrelated to nelarabine exposure 
but generally correlated with greater exposure to ara-G. The safety margin for neurotoxicity was well 
below 1, whether based on ara-G exposure (AUC values) or nelarabine dose expressed in mg/m2. As 
such, treatment with  nelarabine is expected to result  in potentially serious  adverse events relating to 
haematological,  gastrointestinal  and/or  nervous  system  disorders.  Like  other  nucleoside  analogue 
antimetabolites, nelarabine was genotoxic in a mouse lymphoma assay. Carcinogenicity studies were 
not conducted and are not required for anticancer drugs.

Although  non-clinical  studies  of  toxicity  to  reproduction  are  not  required  for  anticancer  drugs, 
nelarabine  was  tested  for  embryo-foetal  developmental  toxicity  in  a  conventional  segment  II  test  in 
rabbits.  There  was  an  increased  incidence  of  malformations  at  exposures  ≥354  mg/m2/day, 
corresponding  to  a  safety  margin  well  below  1  in  adult  humans.  As  such,  nelarabine  is  a  potential 
teratogen.  Nelarabine  should  not  be  used  during  pregnancy  unless  clearly  necessary.  If  a  patient 
becomes pregnant during treatment with nelarabine, they should be informed of the possible risk to the 
foetus.  Both  sexually  active  men  and  women  should  use  effective  methods  of  contraception  during 
treatment and for at least three months following cessation of treatment. The effect of nelarabine on 
fertility  in  humans  is  unknown.  Based  on  the  pharmacological  action  of  the  compound,  undesirable 
effects on fertility are possible. Family planning should be discussed with patients as appropriate. It is 
unknown  whether  nelarabine  or  its  metabolites  are  excreted  in  human  breast  milk.  The  excretion  of 
nelarabine  in  milk  has  not  been  studied  in  animals.  However,  because  of  the  potential  for  serious 
adverse reactions in infants, breastfeeding should be discontinued (see SPC sections 4.6 and 5.3). No 
studies  were  performed  in  juvenile  animals  and  there  are  no  data  on  pharmacokinetics  in  juvenile 
animals.  
Gross and  microscopic examination  of  the  site  of IV  administration was included in the repeat-dose 
monkey studies and indicated that nelarabine is well tolerated. A haemolysis and protein flocculation 
study  and  a  conventional  eye  irritation  test  were  both  negative.  There  are  no  studies  of 
immunotoxicity. This is considered justified as reversible immunotoxicity is a well-known class effect 
of  cytotoxic  nucleoside  analogues.  The  drug  substance  contains  six  compound-related  impurities 
whose specification level is above the applicable qualification threshold (0.05%). No details have been 
provided on the structure of these impurities, or on their levels in the batches used in pivotal animal 
safety studies. Given the serious nature of the proposed indication and the fact that nelarabine itself is 
highly  toxic,  it  was  nevertheless  considered  unwarranted  to  request  that  these  be  qualified.  An 
environmental  risk  assessment  was  not  conducted  since  at  the  time  of  submission  the  current  draft 
CHMP guideline exempted orphan drugs from this requirement. Meanwhile, this exemption has been 
eliminated from the final guideline. The latter, however, was not planned to come into effect until 1st 
December  2006.  It  was  therefore  deemed  acceptable  that  no  environmental  risk  assessment  is 
submitted.  At  all  events,  the  small  size  of  the  target  patient  population  precludes  any  significant 
environmental exposure to the drug. 
4.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The  clinical  programme  of  nelarabine  comprised  four  phase  I  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  studies, 
involving patients with various relapsed or refractory haematological malignancies, including non-T-
cell disease (PGAA1001, PGAA1002, PGAA1003, PGAA1005). Three pivotal phase II studies were 
submitted.  Studies  PGAA2001  and  PGAA2002  were  two  independent  pivotal  studies,  conducted  in 
collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI),  aimed to  assess the efficacy of nelarabine in 
paediatric  and  adult  patients  with  refractory  acute  T-cell  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  or  lymphoblastic 
lymphoma.  Study  PGAA2003  was  a  multi-centre  study  to  assess  the  safety  and  the  efficacy  of 
nelarabine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who failed previous Fludarabine therapy. 
Seven small phase II open label studies (CALGB69803, MDACC 86, CALGB59901, SWOG S0010, 
COG AALL00P2, MDACC 430, TRC9701) and compassionate use phase II protocols were submitted 
as  non-pivotal  safety  studies  and  involved  patients  with  haematological  malignancies.  The  Clinical 
trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has provided 
a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were  carried  out  in 
accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Nelarabine  treatment  is  for  intravenous  use  only  and  is  administered  undiluted.  It  must  only  be 
administered  under  the  supervision  of  a  physician  experienced  in  the  use  of  cytotoxic  agents. 
Nelarabine. The recommended dose in adults and adolescents (aged 16 years and older) of nelarabine 
is  1,500 mg/m  2  administered  intravenously  over  two  hours  on  days  1,  3  and  5  and  repeated  every 
21 days.  In  children  and  adolescents  (aged  21  years  and  younger),  the  recommended  dose  of 
nelarabine  is  650 mg/m2  administered  intravenously  over  one  hour  daily  for  5  consecutive  days, 
repeated every 21 days. Both regimens have been studied in the age range 16 to 21 years in clinical 
13/44

trials and the safety and efficacy were similar.  Therefore, for these patients, the prescribing physician 
should  consider  which  regimen  is  appropriate.  Nelarabine  must  be  discontinued  at  the  first  sign  of 
neurological events of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Event (NCI 
CTCAE)  grade  2  or  greater.  Delaying  subsequent  dosing  is  an  option  for  other  toxicities,  including 
haematological toxicity (see SPC section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Pharmacokinetics 
Methods for the determination of nelarabine and ara-G in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid have 
been validated using reverse-phase HPLC analysis and UV detection. An LC/MS/MS method for the 
determination  of  nelarabine  and  ara-G  in  plasma  was  validated.  A  method  for  the  determination  of 
arabinosylguanine  triphosphate  (ara-GTP)  and  fludarabine  triphosphate  (F-ara-ATP)  in  human  cells 
has been validated using an HPLC assay. Ara-GTP and F-ara-ATP were extracted from human cells 
by  protein  precipitation  using  perchloric  acid.  Extracts  were  analyzed  using  HPLC  with  UV 
absorbance  detection  at  256  nm.  Full  validation  reports  documenting  acceptable  levels  of  detection, 
quantification, accuracy and precision have been submitted. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed 
using  standard  non-compartmental  analysis.  Standard  pharmacokinetic  statistical  analyses  have  been 
applied. 
•  Absorption 
Nelarabine is administered as an i.v. solution. Therefore, this section is not applicable.  
•  Distribution 
After i.v. administration, nelarabine is rapidly converted to ara-G. Based on cross study analysis, using 
dose-corrected  data  from  107  adults  and  30  paediatric  patients,  the  mean  volume  of  distribution  at 
steady  state  (Vss)  for  nelarabine  was  115  l/m2  in  adults  and  89.4  l/m2  in  paediatric  patients.  Mean 
Vss/F for ara-G was 44.8 l/m2 in adults and 32.1 l/m2 in paediatric patients. The mean in vitro protein 
binding of nelarabine and ara-G in human plasma was < 25% that was independent of concentration 
over a concentration range of 6 and 600 µM. 
•  Elimination 
After IV administration of  14C-nelarabine in animals, urinary excretion accounted for the majority of 
elimination (62-75% of dose in mice, 63-69% in monkey).  Less than 6% of the dose was excreted in 
faeces  and  bile.    These  data  suggest  that  the  primary  clearance  of  nelarabine  is  by  metabolism 
followed  by  excretion  in  urine.    Renal  excretion  accounted  for  approximately  5%  and  23%  of  the 
administered dose for nelarabine and Ara-G, respectively.  
With  human  hepatocytes, ara-G,  uric  acid,  xanthine  and  allantoin  were  the  metabolites  observed  for 
nelarabine; uric acid, xanthine and allantoin were the metabolites observed for ara-G. The results from 
metabolism studies indicate that the principal route of metabolism for nelarabine in preclinical studies 
was  O-demethylation  by  adenosine  deaminase  to  form  ara-G,  which  underwent  hydrolysis  to  form 
guanine.  In  addition,  some  nelarabine  was  hydrolyzed  to  form  methylguanine,  which  was  O-
demethylated  to  form  guanine.  Guanine  was  N-deaminated  to  form  xanthine,  which  was  further 
oxidized to yield uric acid.  
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In  cross-study  analysis,  nelarabine  and  ara-G  AUC0-t  and  AUCinf  values  were  examined  for  dose 
proportionality for adult and pediatric patients separately, with dose expressed either in total mg and in 
mg/m2.  In  adult  patients,  AUC0-t  and  AUCinf  data  were  available  from  53  to  98  patients,  having 
received nelarabine doses ranging from 200 to 2900 mg/m2. In pediatric patients, AUC0-t and AUCinf 
data were available from 16 to 24 patients, having received nelarabine doses ranging from 100 to 2350 
mg/m2.  In  adult  patients,  the  results  of  the  power  model  were  reasonably  consistent  with  dose 
proportionality for both nelarabine and ara-G with dose expressed in either mg or mg/m2. In pediatric 
patients,  the  results  for  ara-G  were  consistent  with  dose  proportionality.  However,  the  results  for 
nelarabine were less than dose proportional. Based on these results, data obtained with various doses 
14/44

were  combined,  correcting  the  relevant  PK  parameters  for  a  dose  of  1500  mg/m2,  for  evaluation  of 
potential predictors of pharmacokinetics. 
Single  dose  pharmacokinetic  data  for  nelarabine,  ara-G  and  ara-GTP  obtained  from  cross-study 
analysis of study PGAA1001, 1002, 1003 and 1005 were analyzed in 124 patients for nelarabine, 100 
patients for ara-G, and 51 patients for intracellular ara-GTP, for which data were dose-normalized to 
1500  mg/m2. Pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients, receiving the nelarabine 650 mg/m2 infused 
over  1  hour  were  obtained  from  a  preliminary  analysis  of  the  ongoing  clinical  study  AALL00P2. 
Pharmacokinetics  obtained  from  this  study  was  compared  to  those  of  the  cross-study  analysis.  The 
data obtained in 6 pediatric patients in study AALL00P2 were in line with results obtained in the other 
PK studies, applying a different dosage (data not shown). 
In study PGAA1003, full nelarabine  and  ara-G  pharmacokinetics were obtained at  day 1 and  day 5. 
Analysis  of  time-dependence  comparing  day  1  and  day  5,  based  on  dose-corrected  parameters  in 
adults  indicated  that  no  clinically  relevant  accumulation  occurred  for  nelarabine  and  ara-G  upon 
repeated infusion of nelarabine at day 1, 3 and 5.  
•  Special populations 
No specific  clinical trials  were conducted to investigate the PK of  nelarabine, ara-G, or intracellular 
ara-GTP in special populations. The relationship between PK parameters and covariates was explored 
by  stepwise  regression  analysis.  Covariates  of  interest  (study,  age,  gender,  race,  BSA,  disease 
category, baseline calculated CrCl) were included in the full model of regression analysis. Study was 
included to account for differences between the studies such as number of days of dosing (3 days vs. 5 
days), schedule of dosing (daily x5, daily x3, alternate day dosing), duration of infusion (1 hour vs. 2 
hours), study population. 
Impaired  renal  function:  Baseline  creatinine  clearance  (CrCl)  was  not  a  significant  covariate  for 
nelarabine PK. Ara-G clearance was related to baseline CrCl, being 7% lower in subjects with baseline 
calculated CrCl of 50 to 80 ml/min compared to subjects with CrCl >80ml/min (p=0.036).  
Gender:  Gender  was  not  a  significant  covariate  for  nelarabine  and  ara-G  PK.  However,  dose-
normalized  intracellular  ara-GTP  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  were  4.2  and  2.1  times  higher  (p=0.020  and 
p=0.074),  respectively,  in  adult  females  than  in  adult  males  (AUC0-t  3752  vs.  896  µmol.h/l, 
respectively and Cmax 158 and 74.2 µmol/l, respectively). 
Ethnic  groups:  Ethnic  groups  were  not  found  to  be  a  significant  covariate  on  nelarabine,  ara-G  and 
ara-GTP pharmacokinetics. 
Weight: Nelarabine and ara-G Vss were influenced by BSA, with reduced Vss at lower BSA (p= 0.009 
and  <0.001,  respectively).  Ara-G  Cl/F  was  significantly  correlated  with  BSA  (p<0.001).  Similar 
correlations were observed for weight. 
Elderly: Nelarabine, ara-G and ara-GTP PK in elderly subjects (>65 years of age) were not statistically 
different from PK in the adult population.  
Children:  PK  data  were  compared  between  patients  of  less  than  18  years  of  age,  patients  of  18-65 
years  old  and  patients  more  than  65  years  old.  Age  was  not  found  to  be  a  significant  variable  for 
nelarabine, and ara-G PK. 
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro, nelarabine and ara-G did not inhibit the activities of the major hepatic cytochrome enzymes 
(CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  and  CYP3A4)  up  to  the 
highest  concentration  tested,  i.e.  100  µM.  Nelarabine  and  ara-G  showed  no  inhibition  of  human  P-
glycoprotein  (P-gp)-mediated  efflux  of  [3H]-digoxin  at  concentrations  of  0.3  to  100  µM.  
Additionally, nelarabine and ara-G were not found to be substrates for human P-gp. Both compounds 
showed low passive membrane permeability in these assays.   
In  vivo  data  were  assessed  from  an  open-label  Phase  I  PK/PD  study  (PGAA1005)  to  determine  the 
effect  of  fludarabine  on  intracellular  concentrations  of  9-β-D-arabinofuranosylguanine  triphosphate 
15/44

(ara-GTP)  in  13  patients  with  refractory  leukemia.  Patients  received  nelarabine  at  a  dose  of  1200 
mg/m2 administered as a 2-hour infusion on Days 1, 3, and 5. Fludarabine was administered 4 hours 
before  the  nelarabine  infusion  at  a  dose  of  30  mg/m2  infused  over  30  minutes  on  days  3  and  5  in 
course  1  and  on  days  1,  3,  and  5  on  second  and  subsequent  courses.  The  effect  of  fludarabine 
administration on intracellular ara-GTP exposure was assessed by comparing AUC0-48 values on days 1 
and 3 of the study.  Because of the observed accumulation of ara-GTP with this dosing schedule, day 3 
AUC0-48 values were corrected for carryover from the day 1 dose assuming linear PK behavior. There 
was  no significant difference between the day 1 AUC0-48 and the corrected day 3 AUC0-48 values for 
intracellular  ara-GTP  (geometric  mean  values  of  3957  and  4062  µM.h,  respectively),  demonstrating 
that fludarabine administration before nelarabine on day 3 did not affect the intracellular accumulation 
of ara-GTP. 
•  Discussion on clinical pharmacokinetics  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  nelarabine,  ara-G  and  intracellular  ara-GTP  has  been  well  studied  in  the 
target  population  including  40  patients  below  the  age  of  18.  The  results  presented  were  consistent 
across  the  studied  populations.  Maximum  concentrations  of  ara-G  were  achieved  at  the  end  of 
intravenous infusion of nelarabine, and tended to be higher than nelarabine Cmax. This is consistent 
with a rapid conversion from nelarabine to ara-G as indicated by the short t½ of nelarabine. In adult 
patients,  after  infusion  of  1500 mg/m2  nelarabine  over  two  hours,  mean  plasma  nelarabine  Cmax  and 
AUCinf values were 13.9 µM (81%) and 13.5 µM.h (56%) respectively. Mean plasma ara-G C max and 
AUCinf values were 115 µM (16%) and 571 µM.h (30%), respectively. Intracellular Cmax for ara-GTP 
appeared  within  3  to  25  hours  on  day  1.  Mean  (%CV)  intracellular  ara-GTP  Cmax  and  AUC  values 
were  95.6 µM  (139%)  and  2214  µM.h  (263%)  at  this  dose  (see  SPC  section  5.2).    In  paediatric 
patients, after infusion of  400  or 650 mg/m2  nelarabine  over  one  hour  in 6  paediatric  patients,  mean 
(%CV) plasma nelarabine Cmax and AUCinf values, adjusted to a 650 mg/m2 dose, were 45.0 µM (40%) 
and 38.0 µM.h (39%), respectively. Mean plasma ara-G Cmax and AUCinf values were 60.1 µM (17%) 
and 212 µM.h (18%), respectively. Nelarabine and ara-G were extensively distributed throughout the 
body based on combined Phase I pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 104 to 2900 mg/m2. For 
nelarabine,  mean  (%CV)  V  SS  values  were  115 l/m  2  (159%)  and  89.4 l/m2  (278%)  in  adult  and 
paediatric patients, respectively. For ara-G, mean V  SS/F values were 44.8 l/m2 (32%) and 32.1 l/m  2 
(25%)  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients,  respectively.  In  vitro  protein  binding  of  nelarabine  was  less 
than 25%. Upon repeated administration (either a daily or a day 1, 3, 5 schedule), nelarabine did not 
accumulate.  Dose  proportionality with respect  to AUC exposure was  apparent with the exception of 
nelarabine  in  the  paediatric  population  for  which  less  than  expected  increases  were  observed. 
Nelarabine and ara-G appeared dose-proportional with respect to Cmax in adults while less than dose-
proportional  in  paediatric  patient.  Intracellular  ara-GTP  concentrations  in  leukaemic  blasts  were 
quantifiable for a prolonged period after nelarabine administration. Intracellular ara-GTP accumulated 
with repeated administration of nelarabine. On the day 1, 3, and 5 schedule, Cmax and AUC(0-t) values 
on day 3 were approximately 50% and 30%, respectively, greater than Cmax and AUC(0-t) values on day 
1.  The  PK  of  nelarabine,  ara-G  and  intracellular  ara-GTP  was  characterized  by  a  moderate  between 
subject  variability for the primary active metabolite Ara-G and a  large variability for nelarabine and 
intracellular ara-GTP. Nelarabine Cl and Vss values showed greater between-day variability (53% and 
73%, respectively) than ara-G Cl/F and Vss/F values (15% for both). The population pharmacokinetic 
model  provided  intra-individual  variability  estimates  of  23%  for  nelarabine  clearance  and  13%  for 
intracellular ara-GTP apparent clearance. 
The results from metabolism studies indicate that the principal route of metabolism for nelarabine in 
preclinical  studies  was  O-demethylation  by  adenosine  deaminase  to  form  ara-G,  which  underwent 
hydrolysis to form guanine. In addition, some nelarabine is hydrolysed to form methylguanine, which 
is  O-demethylated  to  form  guanine.  Guanine  is  N-deaminated  to  form  xanthine,  which  is  further 
oxidized to yield uric acid. Nelarabine and ara-G are rapidly eliminated from plasma with a half-life of 
approximately  30  minutes  and  3  hours,  respectively.  The  excretion  of  nelarabine  is  mainly  through 
urine,  primarily  as  metabolites.  Urinary  excretion  of  nelarabine  and  ara-G  accounted  for  5.3%  and 
23.2% of the dose, respectively.  Because the timecourse of intracellular ara-GTP was prolonged, its 
elimination half-life could not be accurately estimated.

No  specific  studies  were  performed  in  special  populations.  Stratified  analysis  identified  BSA  as  a 
major  predictor  of  PK.  Gender  has  no  effect  on  nelarabine  or  ara-G  pharmacokinetics.  Intracellular 
ara-GTP C max and AUC (0–t) values at the same dose level was 2 to 3 fold greater on average in adult 
female  than  in  adult  male  patients.  Ethnic  groups  had  no  apparent  effect  on  nelarabine,  ara-G,  or 
intracellular ara-GTP pharmacokinetics (see SPC section 5.2). Clinical pharmacology data in children 
below the age of 4 was limited. Combined phase I PK data at nelarabine doses of 104 to 2900 mg/m 2 
indicated that Cl and Vss values for nelarabine and ara-G are comparable between the two groups (see 
SPC  section  4.2  and  5.2).  No  data  were  available  in  hepatically  impaired  patients.  These  patients 
should  be  treated  with  caution  (see  SPC  section  4.2).  The  PK  of  nelarabine  and  ara-G  has  not  been 
studied in renally impaired or haemodialysed patients. Nelarabine is excreted by the kidney to a small 
extent (5 to 10% of the administered dose) whereas ara-G is excreted by the kidney to a greater extent 
(20  to  30%  of  the  administered  nelarabine  dose).  The  mean  apparent  clearance  (Cl/F)  of  ara-G  was 
about 7% lower in patients with mild renal impairment (Clcr = 50 to 80 ml/min) than in patients with 
normal  renal  function  (Clcr  >  80 ml/min),  see  SPC  section  5.2.  No  data  were  available  to  provide  a 
dose advice for patients with Cl cr less than 50 ml/min. Patients with renal impairment must be closely 
monitored  for  toxicities  when  treated  with  nelarabine  (see  SPC  sections  4.2  and  5.2).  In  elderly 
patients, decreased renal function, which is more common in the elderly, may reduce ara-G clearance 
(see section 4.2). 
Nelarabine  and  ara-G  did  not  inhibit  the  activities  of  the  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  (CYP1A2, 
CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  and  CYP3A4).  Nelarabine  and  ara-G 
showed no inhibition of human P-glycoprotein and were not found to be substrates for human P-gp in 
vitro. Concomitant treatment with fludarabine does not appear to influence the intracellular ara-GTP 
exposure.  From  a  theoretical  point  of  view,  concomitant  treatment  with  potent  adenosine  deaminase 
inhibitors such as pentostatin is not recommended as the efficacy of nelarabine may be reduced and/or 
the adverse event profile of either active substance may be change (see SPC section 4.5).  
Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action 
Nelarabine,  a  water-soluble  prodrug  of  ara-G,  is  a  deoxyguanosine  analogue.  Nelarabine  is  rapidly 
demethylated  by  adenosine  deaminase  in  the  peripheral  blood  to  ara-G.  In  vitro  studies  and 
biochemical  studies  have  demonstrated  that  intracellular  ara-G  is  phosphorylated  via  deoxycytidine 
kinase  (dCK)  and  deoxyguanosine  kinase  (dGK)  to  the  5’-monophosphate,  which  undergoes  further 
phosphorylation to the active 5’-triphosphate, 9-β-D-arabinofuranosylguanine triphosphate (ara-GTP). 
Ara-GTP  is  incorporated  into  deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA)  and  acts  as  a  chain  terminator  stopping 
further DNA synthesis, which results in cell death.  In vitro, T-cells are more sensitive than B-cells to 
the cytotoxic effects of nelarabine.  
•  Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No human pharmacodynamic studies were performed.  
A  cross-study  pharmacodynamic  analysis  was  performed  to  investigate  the  relationships  between 
intracellular  ara-GTP  exposure  and  neurotoxicity.  A 
plasma  nelarabine,  plasma  ara-G,  or 
concentration-effect  relationship  was  identified  between  intracellular  ara-GTP  Cmax  and  AUC(0-t)  
and neurotoxicity.  
Intracellular  ara-GTP  concentrations  were  quantified  in  51  patients  with  leukaemic  blast  counts  of 
>10,000/µl.  Dose-normalized  intracellular  ara-GTP  AUC(0-t)  and  Cmax  values  were  influenced  by 
gender (2- to 3-fold higher in adult female patients than in adult male patients). Other potential factors 
(age, race, body surface area, baseline calculated creatinine clearance, disease category, study) did not 
appear  to  influence  intracellular  ara-GTP  exposure.  In  study  PGAA1001,  median  intracellular  ara-
GTP  Cmax  values  were  139  µM  in  patients  who  responded  and  46  µM  in  patients  who  did  not 
respond.  In  study  PGAA1003,  median  intracellular  ara-GTP  Cmax  values  were  292  µM  in  patients 
who  responded  and  100  µM  in  patients  who  did  not  respond.  In  study  PGAA1005,  median 
intracellular  ara-GTP  Cmax  values  were  835  µM  in  patients  who  responded  and  40  µM  in  patients 
who did not respond (see PK interaction studies and clinical efficacy/dose response studies regarding 
17/44

the  design  of  these  studies).  A  cross-study  PD  analysis  was  performed  to  look  for  relationships 
between plasma nelarabine or ara-G pharmacokinetics or intracellular ara-GTP exposure and clinical 
response.  Intracellular  ara-GTP  exposure  in  leukaemic  blasts  was  higher  in  patients  who  responded 
than  in patients who  did  not respond.  No relationship was seen  between nelarabine or  ara-G  plasma 
exposure and response.  
One  combination  study  was  performed  to  examine  interactions  with  other  medicinal  products  or 
substances, i.e., of nelarabine and fludarabine (study PGAA1005). No effect on nelarabine, ara-G, or 
intracellular ara-GTP pharmacokinetics was observed after fludarabine administration on Day 3.  
In  vitro  cytotoxicity  studies  have  demonstrated  concentration-dependent  increases  in  the  growth 
inhibitory  IC50  values  for  nelarabine  in  the  presence  of  adenosine  deaminase  ADA  inhibitors.  The 
ADA inhibitors studied had no effect on the IC50 values for ara-G. Pentostatin (deoxycoformycin), an 
anti leukemic drug, is also a potent inhibitor of ADA (see discussion on clinical pharmacokinetics).  
•  Discussion on clinical pharmacodynamics  
Cross-study analyses were performed combining the data from study PGAA1001, study PGAA1002, 
and  study  PGAA1003  to  evaluate  potential  relationships  between  plasma  exposure  of  nelarabine  or 
ara-G or intracellular exposure of ara-GTP and response using logistic regression models. Intracellular 
ara-GTP exposure in leukemic blasts was higher in patients who responded than in patients who did 
not  respond.    No  relationship  was  seen  between  nelarabine  or  ara-G  plasma  exposure  and  response.  
This result is consistent with the suggestion that the intracellular generation of ara-GTP is responsible 
for the cytotoxic effects seen with nelarabine. 
The dose-limiting toxicity of nelarabine observed across the Phase I program was grade 3 and grade 4 
neurotoxicity  affecting  both  the  central  and  peripheral  nervous  systems.  Central  nervous  system 
toxicities included somnolence, seizures, dizziness, confusion, and ataxia. Peripheral nervous system 
toxicities  included  hypoesthesia,  paresthesia  and  pain  in  extremities,  peripheral  neuropathy,  and 
Guillain-Barré like syndrome. 
The Guillain-Barré like syndrome was observed in study PGAA1001 (dosing for 5 consecutive days). 
The  Guillain-Barré  like  syndrome  was  observed  in  5  of  93  patients.  It  was  not  reversible.  The 
polyradiculopathy  behaved  like  a  chronic  demyelinating  neuropathy.  Each  of  the  cases  of  Guillian-
Barré-like syndrome was considered possibly related to the administration of nelarabine. Three cases 
occurred within 22 days (range: 7 to 22 days) of the initial dose of nelarabine. One of the five cases 
occurred  at  the  recommended  Phase  II  dose  of  1200  mg/m2  (adult  patient).  All  other  cases  were  at 
doses  greater  than  1200  mg/m2.  Besides  nelarabine,  factors  that  influence  CNS  function,  like 
medication,  exposure  to  neurotoxic  chemotherapeutic  agents,  prior  CNS  radiation  as  well  as 
electrolyte imbalances, may have contributed also to the neurotoxicity as observed. 
Clinical efficacy  
•  Dose response studies 
A  total  of  181  patients  (142  adults  of  more  than  17 years  old,  39  paediatric  patients  of  less  than  17 
years  old)  received  at  least  one  dose  of  nelarabine  across  4  phase  I  studies  (studies  PGAA1001, 
PGAA1002,  PGAA1003,  PGAA1005).  The  median  dose  was  1360  mg/m2  (range:  104  -  2900 
mg/m2).  The  total  number  of  cycles  administered  was  361,  with  a  median  number  of  cycles  of  one 
(range: 1 - 16) and a mean of 2 cycles. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined based on 
observed dose-limiting toxicities using three different dosing schedules: daily dosing for 5 consecutive 
days (study PGAA1001), daily  dosing for 3 consecutive  days (study  PGAA1002), and alternate  day 
dosing on Days 1, 3, and 5 (study PGAA1003).  
Study  PGAA1001  was  a  stratified,  dose  escalation,  open-label,  phase  I  PK  study  to  determine  the 
MTD of nelarabine when administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on a once-daily schedule for 5 
consecutive days. Patients were enrolled into one of four groups: adult leukemia (stratum 1), paediatric 
leukemia (stratum 2), adult lymphoma (stratum 3), and paediatric lymphoma (stratum 4). Ninety-three 
patients, including 65 adults (i.e. ≥18 years of age at the time of first dose) and 28 paediatric patients 
(i.e.  <18  years  of  age  at  the  time  of  first  dose)  were  enrolled  and  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
nelarabine.    Doses  (5,  10,  20,  40,  60,  and  75  mg/kg)  were  increased  (increments  from  25  to  100%) 
18/44

until the MTD (the dose at which 2/6 or 3/6 patients experienced grade 3/4 toxicity) was reached. The 
schedule  was  amended  because  of  grade  3  and  4  neurotoxicity  in  adult  (40  mg/kg)  and  paediatric 
patients  (≥60  mg/kg).  All  patients  who  had  received  doses  ≥40  mg/kg  had  their  subsequent  doses 
lowered  to  1200  mg/m2  once  daily  for  5  days.  Patients  who  had  no  evidence  of  intolerable 
myelosuppression or other grade 3/4 toxicity during the 21-day period after initiation of therapy, was 
eligible  to  receive  a  subsequent  course  of  therapy  of  1200  mg/m2  once  daily  for  5  days.  Clinical 
activity  of  nelarabine  was  observed  in  35%  (33/93)  of  patients.    Complete  responses  occurred  in  7 
adult  patients  with  T-cell  ALL/LBL,  T-cell  chronic 
leukemia  (CLL),  T-cell 
lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and CML in blast crisis 
and 6 paediatric patients with T-cell ALL/LBL.  Partial responses occurred in 18 adult patients with T-
cell ALL/LBL, T-cell CLL, T-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), other T-cell diseases, and B-cell 
ALL, B-cell CLL/B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), and B-cell NHL. Partial responses occurred 
in 2 paediatric patients with T-cell ALL/LBL and T-cell NHL.   
lymphocytic 
Study  PGAA1002  was  a  dose  escalation  (1200,  1500,  1800,  2200,  and  2500  mg/m²),  open-label, 
safety  and  PK  study  initially  planned  to  evaluate  the  MTD  of  nelarabine  administered  as  an 
intravenous infusion over 2 hours daily for 3 consecutive days in adult (≥18 years) and paediatric (<18 
years)  patients  with  refractory  haematologic  malignancies;  27  patients  (17  adult;  10  paediatric 
patients) were enrolled and received at least one dose of nelarabine.  
Based on clinical results in study PGAA1001 (grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicity), the protocol was 
amended  to  change  the  administration  of  nelarabine  to  900,  1200,  or  1500  mg/m2  by  intravenous 
infusion over a 2-hour period once daily for either 3 or 5 consecutive days in paediatric patients and 
for 3 consecutive days in adult patients. Dose escalations in the adult patients receiving 1200 mg/m2 
and  1500  mg/m2  were  terminated  because  of  possibly  drug-related  grade  3/4  non-hematological 
toxicity. The 900  mg/m2 dose  was recommended for phase II studies. Clinical activity of nelarabine 
was  observed  in  14.8%  (4/27)  of  patients.  A  complete  response  occurred  in  2  patients  (1200  mg/m2 
and  1500  mg/m2)  with  T-cell  ALL/LBL  and  1  patient  (900  mg/m2)  with  T-cell  non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL). A partial response occurred in one patient (900 mg/m2) with T-cell ALL/LBL.   
Study  PGAA1003  was  an  open-label,  dose  escalation  (1200,  1500,  1800,  2200,  and  2500  mg/m²), 
safety and PK study to determine the MTD of nelarabine when administered as a 2-hour intravenous 
infusion  on  a  day  1,  3,  and  5  schedule,  repeated  every  21  to  28  days,  in  adult  (≥18  years)  and 
paediatric  (<18  years)  patients  with  refractory  hematologic  malignancies;  48  patients  (46  adults;  2 
paediatric  patients)  were  enrolled  and  received  at  least  one  dose  of  nelarabine.  An  amendment  was 
made  to  the  protocol  to  include  higher  nelarabine  dose  levels  (2900,  3300,  3800,  4400,  and  5000 
mg/m²) at the same dosing schedule, as MTD was not observed with the previous doses. Dose-limiting 
toxicities  were  observed  at  the  2900  mg/m²  dose  level  in  adult  patients  (2/2  patients  with  grade  3 
ataxia).  Unresolved  grade  1  and  2  clinically  significant  peripheral  neuropathy  was  observed  in  2/11 
adult patients at the 2500 mg/m² dose level. The MTD of nelarabine administered on a Day 1, 3, and 5 
schedules  every  21-28  days  in  adult  patients  was  2200  mg/m²/dose.  The  2200  mg/m²  dose  was 
recommended for further studies. Dose escalations in paediatric patients were incomplete because of a 
lack  of  available  patients.  Clinical  activity  of  nelarabine  was  observed  in  18.7%  (9/48)  of  patients. 
Nelarabine demonstrated clinical activity in adult and paediatric patients with refractory T-cell (T-cell 
ALL/LBL, T-cell PLL, T-cell NHL) and B-cell (B-cell CLL, B-cell NHL) hematologic malignancies. 
•  Main studies 
Two study reports of open-label non-comparative phase II studies pertinent to the claimed indication 
were submitted. Study PGAA2001 was a Phase II study to evaluate nelarabine in paediatric patients 
(≤21  years  of  age  at  diagnosis)  with  refractory  or  relapsed  T-lineage  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia 
(ALL)  or  lymphoblastic  lymphoma  (LBL).  Study  PGAA2002  was  a  Phase  II  study  to  evaluate 
nelarabine  in  adult  patients  (≥16  years  of  age  at  diagnosis)  refractory  or  relapsed  T-lineage  acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL).  
These two studies were sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and conducted by the Cancer 
and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), and the Children’s Oncology Group (COG).

Study PGAA2001 (paediatric) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
This was a phase II, two-stage, open label, multicentre clinical trial. The main inclusion criteria were 
patients ≤ 21 years of age at diagnosis with refractory or recurrent T-ALL or T-NHL, a predicted life 
expectancy  of  ≥ 8  weeks,  Karnofsky  Performance  Status  (KPS)  ≥ 50,  no  severe  infection,  adequate 
hepatic  (bilirubine  ≤  1.5mg/dL;  SGPT  <  5xN)  and  renal  function  (creatinine  normal  for  age  or 
creatinine  clearance  or  GFR  ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m2).  Exclusion  criteria  were  pregnant  or  lactating 
females and baseline ≥ grade 2 neurotoxicity.  
Treatments 
Nelarabine  was  administered  at  a  dose  of  400  mg/m2,  650  mg/m2,  900  mg/m2,  or  1200  mg/m2 
(depending  on  strata  assignment  and  date  of  enrollment)  as  a  1hour  infusion  daily  for  5  days  (see 
protocol amendments in section “conduct of the study”).  Cycles were to be repeated every 21 days or 
until  the  occurrence  of  one  or  more  of  the  following:  disease  progression,  unmanageable  toxicity, 
continued treatment with nelarabine was no longer deemed beneficial, or treatment had continued for 
two years. Patients in Strata 02, 03 and 04 could also receive triple intrathecal therapy consisting of 
cytarabine, methotrexate and hydrocortisone. 
All patients were to be pre-treated with allopurinol beginning a minimum of one day prior to the first 
cycle of treatment with nelarabine. In the presence of a high initial WBC (>50,000/µl), organomegaly, 
or initial hyperuricemia, hydration was to be initiated with 2400-3000 ml/m2/day IV fluids containing 
sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), to maintain urine pH ≥ 6.5. Potassium containing solutions were to be 
avoided during tumor lysis. Antiemetics, antibiotics, blood and platelet transfusions or other necessary 
medical  and  supportive  care  was  to  be  used  as  indicated.  Prophylactic  TMP/SMZ  was  to  be 
administered in two divided doses on 3 consecutive days each week, if hepatic toxicity >grade2 was 
noted.  Alternative  pneumocystic  carinii  pneumonia  prophylaxis  was  to  be  substituted  for  patients 
discontinuing TMP/SMZ therapy. 
Follow up information was to be collected at completion of protocol therapy, every six months until 
four  years  from  registration,  and  annually  thereafter  unless  the  patient  subsequently  entered  another 
study  or  died.  Off  protocol  therapy  follow-up  included  information  on  survival,  relapse,  late  effects 
events, and additional anti-cancer therapy. 
Objectives 
The  primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy (response rate: CR and PR, complete and  partial 
response) of nelarabine administered as a one-hour infusion daily for 5 days in pediatric patients with 
relapsed or refractory T-ALL or T-NHL.  Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety, duration of 
response and time to response in paediatric patients and to correlate the pharmacology of nelarabine, 
and ara-G nucleotides with clinical response 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  response  rate  i.e.,  complete  response  (CR)  defined  as  no  evidence  of 
remaining tumour and haematological recovery within one month after remission induction treatment, 
and partial response (PR). The study population includes all patients that received at least one dose of 
study drug. 
CR  was  defined  as  bone  marrow  blast  counts  ≤5%,  no  evidence  of  disease,  and  full  recovery  of 
peripheral blood counts (i.e., ANC >1500/μl, platelets >100 000/μl, Hgb ≥10 g/dl for patients less than 
2 years of age, Hgb ≥11 for patients ≥2 years of age).  
CR* was defined as bone marrow blast counts ≤5% and no other evidence of disease but incomplete 
haematologic  recovery.  These  patients  may  have  had  hypocellular  bone  marrow  or  peripheral 
haematology parameters not normalised. 
20/44

A partial bone marrow response was defined as bone marrow blast percents less than or equal to 25% 
occurring at any time on the study.  
CRh*  was  defined  as  bone  marrow  blast  counts  ≤5%,  no  other  evidence  of  disease,  and  partial 
recovery of peripheral blood counts (i.e., ANC >500/μl, platelets >50 000/μl, Hgb ≥ 7 g/dl). 
Independent  review  of  bone  marrow  aspirates  or  biopsies  took  place  in  patients  who  achieved  a 
haematological response. Marrow specimens appeared not available from all responding patients. The 
available specimens were scored as M1 (bone marrow with blast counts ≤5%), M2 (marrow required 
blast counts ≤25%) or M3 (blast counts >25%).  
The secondary outcome measures included duration of response, measured from the date of response 
assessment to relapse, death, or last date of contact. Treatment with additional anti-cancer therapy was 
not a criterium for termination of response. Relapse was determined by occurrence or reoccurrence of 
disease in bone marrow, peripheral blood blasts, CSF or extramedullary disease. If the patient either 
did not have disease in one of these sites or had achieved response at one of these sites, then relapse 
was  appearance  or  reappearance  of  disease  at  that  site.  For  bone  marrow  this  was  >  5%  blasts,  for 
peripheral blood blasts or CSF this was blasts > 0%. Extramedullary relapse was signs of disease in 
the spleen, liver, lymph nodes, mediastinal mass, testes or other site. If the patient showed disease at 
one of these sites but was stable or improved, relapse was defined as progressive or increasing disease 
at that site. 
From  patients  that  proceeded  to  SCT  after  a  nelarabine  induced  remission,  the  time  in  remission 
afterwards was included in the calculation of duration of response. 
Time to Response was defined as the elapsed time from treatment start to response date. 
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the elapsed time from treatment start date to death. Patients who 
were alive at the end of the study reporting period were censored at date of last contact. 
Sample size  
Stage 1 required > 4/20 evaluable patients with early marrow response, in order to enrol an additional 
17  evaluable  patients  in  stage  2  (see  statistical  methods),  with  a  type  1  error  rate  of  0.094  and 
statistical  power  of  0.903.  After  a  protocol  amendment  to  update  the  assumptions  of  the  null  and 
alternative hypotheses, the sample size calculations were amended. The alternative hypothesis for the 
early marrow response rate was reduced from 40% to 35% and corresponding changes were made to 
patient  accrual  needed  for  stage  1  and  stage  2.  Stage  1  required  >3/19  evaluable  patients  with  early 
marrow response, to enrol an additional 14 evaluable patients in stage 2 with type 1 error rate of 0.096 
and statistical power of 0.904.

Randomisation and blinding 
Study PGAA2001 was an open label study with no randomisation process. Seventy-eight Children’s 
Oncology  Group  (COG)  institutions  in  the  US,  Canada,  and  Australia  participated  in  this  study, 
enrolling between 1 and 6 patients per institution.  
Statistical methods 
A  two-stage  design  was  used  to  determine  if  there  was  sufficient  activity  to  warrant  complete 
enrolment  in  a  given  stratum.  An  interim  futility  analysis  was  planned  after  the  first  19  evaluable 
patients.  If  less  than  4  of  the  first  19  evaluable  patients  experienced  response,  enrolment  was  to  be 
terminated. If there were 3 or fewer responders from the first 19 evaluable patients enrolled in either 
stratum 01 or 02 (see participant flow), that data would have supported the null hypothesis. If four or 
more patients experienced a response rate enrolment was to continue. 
The  null  hypothesis  of  a  response  rate  of  ≤  15%  was  tested  against  the  alternative  hypothesis  of  a 
response  rate  of  ≥  35%.  Following  an  amendment  to  the  protocol  the  alternative  hypothesis  for  the 
early marrow response rate was increased from 30% to 40%, the null hypothesis for the early marrow 
response rate was increased from 10% to 20%; the alpha level was reduced from 0.55 to 0.09.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Patients were entered into one of the following four strata based on presentation of disease: 
Stratum 01: T-ALL or T-NHL in first relapse (>25% bone marrow blasts, with or without concomitant 
extramedullary relapse - other than central nervous system [CNS]). 
Stratum 02: T-ALL or T-NHL in second or later relapse (>25% bone marrow blasts, with or without 
concomitant extramedullary relapse - other than CNS). 
Stratum  03:  T-ALL  or  T-NHL  with  positive  bone  marrow  and  CSF  (>5%  bone  marrow  blasts  and 
CNS 2 or 3 involvement); CNS 2: subjects with <5 WBC/mm3 and positive cytology; CNS 3: subjects 
with ≥ 5 WBC/mm3 and positive cytology. 
Stratum  04:  Extramedullary  relapse  and  <25%  bone  marrow  blasts  in  the  bone  marrow  (excluding 
isolated CNS relapse). Strata 03 and 04 were introduced as an amendment to the protocol. Stratum 03 
was opened with the goal of accruing data from patients with neurological complications. Stratum 04 
was  added  to  gain  insight  in  treatment  of  extramedullary  disease  without  bone  marrow  or  CNS 
involvement. 
A  total  of  70  paediatric  patients  were  treated  with  nelarabine  in  strata  1  and  2.  In  Stratum  01, 
29% (9/31) of patients were withdrawn to receive bone marrow transplants. In Stratum 02, 13% (5/39) 
of  patients  were  withdrawn  in  order  to  receive  SCT.  The  study  population  includes  all  patients  that 
received at least one dose of study drug.

Conduct of the study 
Six  amendments  to  the  protocol  were  made  during  the  study.  The  first  amendment  included  a  dose 
reduction from 1200mg/m2 to 900 mg/m2 due to grade 4 neurotoxicity. The protocol was also revised 
to  update  the  assumptions  of  the  null  and  alternative  hypotheses  and  to  provide  more  stringent 
criterion for testing the hypotheses. Amendment 2 included a dose of 30mg/kg for infants of less than 
one  year  of  age.  Amendment  3  dealt  with  updates  on  the  toxicity  section.  The  fourth  amendment 
included a dose reduction from 900 mg/m2/day to 650 mg/m2/day x 5 days for all patients over 1 year 
of  age  and  20  mg/kg  for  infant  up  to  one year,  due  to  reports  of  Guillain-Barre-like  syndrome.  The 
protocol also amended the assumptions of the null and alternative hypotheses, and hence the sample 
size  calculations.  Amendment  5  involved  a  dose  reduction  for  Strata  03  and  04  to  400  mg/m2.  This 
dose  was  planned  for  use  in  future  study.  Amendment  6  was  introduced  to  collect  post  stem  cell 
transplant  engraftment  data  on  patients  who  received  nelarabine  and  then  subsequently  received  a 
bone  marrow  transplant.  The  "completed"  status  of  the  study  was  withdrawn  and  the  status  was 
redefined as "Treatment Completed".  
Baseline data 
Patients were allocated to stratum based on the number of prior inductions reported by investigators. 
All patients in stratum 01 had received one prior induction and all patients in stratum 02 had received 
more than 1 prior induction (see table 7):

Outcomes and estimation 
Response rate 
In stratum 01, 42% of patients (13/31) achieved a CR and 48% of patients (15/31) of patients achieved 
a CR*. In stratum 02, 13% (5/39) of patients achieved CR and 23% (9/39) reached CR* (table 11). The 
5 patients who achieved a CR are also included in the 9 patients who achieved a CR*.

Among the 70 patients in strata 01 and 02, 31 were not in remission from the disease (<CR) after their 
most recent prior induction regimen. Of these 31, 26% (8/31) of patients achieved CR. 35% (11/31) of 
patients whose previous induction failed (<CR) reached CR*.

In stratum 01, the median duration of response was 273.3 weeks. For the 13 patients who achieved a 
CR, the duration ranged from 0.9 to >260 weeks; 13/15 patients reached a CR or CR* and received 
SCT. In stratum 02 the median duration of response was 12.3 weeks. For the 5 patients who achieved 
a  CR,  the  duration  ranged from  4.7 to 36.4 weeks;  4/9  patients reached  at least a CR* and  received 
SCT.

Survival 
The median overall survival was 33.3 weeks (95% CI: 24.1, 93.6) in stratum 01 and 13.1 weeks (95% 
CI: 8.7, 17.4) in stratum 02. The one year survival rate was 33% in stratum 1 and 14% in stratum 02 
(see table 13). Among the five patients alive at one year, three responded to nelarabine (one each of 
CR,  CRh*,  and  mCR),  and  two  of  these  three  received  a  subsequent  allogeneic  bone  marrow 
transplant. The third patient had received a transplant prior to receiving nelarabine. Two patients alive 
at  one  year  had  a  marginal  marrow  PR  while  on  nelarabine.  One  of  these  patients  did  go  on  to 
transplant.  Among  patients  who  achieved  a  CR  on  nelarabine,  survival  ranged  from  16.6  to  57.4 
weeks.

Study PGAA2002 (Adults) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
This was a phase II, open label, multicentre clinical trial. The main inclusion criteria were patients ≥ 
16  years  of  age  with  a  diagnosis  of  relapsed  or  refractory  T-lineage  ALL  or  LBL.  Leukemia  or 
lymphoma cells must have expressed at least two of the following cell surface antigens: CD1a, CD2, 
CD3  (surface  or  cytoplasmic),  CD4,  CD5,  CD7,  and  CD8.  Leukemia  cells  must  also  have  been 
negative  for  myeloperoxidase  or  Sudan  Black  B.  If  the  only  T  cell  markers  present  were  CD4  and 
CD7, the leukemic cells were to lack myeloid markers, CD33 and /or CD13 (results of TdT assay were 
to be included if performed).  
Treatments 
Nelarabine was administered as an undiluted IV infusion over 2 hours at a dosage of 1500 mg/m2 on 
days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21 day cycle. Three subjects received a starting dose of 2200 mg/m2/day. 
The  adult  dose  was  decreased  from  2200  mg/m2  to  1500  mg/m2  on  the  day  1,  3,  5  schedule  due  to 
neurological events observed in subjects on another trial (study PGAA2003).  Three subjects received 
a  total  of  four  cycles  of  the  higher  dose.  Patients  were  permitted  to  receive  full  supportive  care 
including  transfusions  of  blood  products,  antibiotics  and  anti-emetics.  Hormones  (including 
dexamethasone  and  other  steroidal  anti-emetic  agents,  other  chemotherapeutic  agents,  filgrastim, 
sargramostim, and erythropoietin were prohibited. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine the efficacy (response rate) of nelarabine given at a dose of 
1500 mg/m2/day on an alternate day schedule (days 1, 3, 5) in adult patients with refractory or relapsed 
T-ALL or LBL. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety of nelarabine administered on this 
schedule, the impact of nelarabine therapy on survival. Time to response was also evaluated. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was response rate (CR, CR* and PR). Response was measured using established 
clinical and hematologic (blood and bone marrow) response criteria. 
CR for ALL was defined as: ANC >1500/μl, no circulating blasts, platelets >100,000/μl, bone marrow 
blast  counts  ≤5%,  no  evidence  of  disease.  CR  for  LBL  was  defined  as:  disappearance  of  all 
26/44

measurable disease, signs, symptoms, and biochemical changes related to the tumor and appearance of 
no new lesions. 
PR for ALL was defined as: bone marrow blast percents less than or equal to 25% occurring at any 
time on the study. PR for LBL a reduction of ≥50% in the sum of the products of the perpendicular 
diameters of all measurable lesions. No new lesions could appear and no existing lesion could enlarge. 
Independent  review of  bone  marrow  aspirates  or  biopsies took  place  in patients at different stage of 
therapy. 
Regarding  the  definitions  of  CR*  and  of  the  secondary  endpoints  (i.e.  duration  of  response,  time  to 
response and overall survival), see section “Outcomes/endpoints” of study PGAA2001. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 35 patients was based on the primary endpoint of complete response rate. Criteria for 
response  rate  were  described  in  the  protocol  as  a  null  hypothesis  consisting  of  a  CR  probability  of 
≤10% versus an  alternative hypothesis  consisting of  a CR  probability of ≥30%, with a  type I  and II 
errors of 5% and 10%. Although the planned sample size was 35 patients, a total of 39 patients were 
treated (α = 7%; 1-β = 93%). 
Randomisation and blinding 
Study PGAA2002 was an open label study with no randomisation process.  
Statistical methods 
Per protocol, should the data indicate that the true response is at least 30% the drug will be considered 
active. If the data indicate that the true response rate is no better than 10% the drug will be considered 
inactive.  95%  CIs  for  response  rates  were  calculated  using  the  exact  binomial  method.  Because  of 
small  sample  sizes,  analysis  using  Kaplan-Meier  methods  were  not  done.  Overall  survival  for  all 
treated patients and by number of prior induction was summarised using Kaplan-Meier product limit 
methods. Survival at one year was summarised by number of prior inductions and by response to most 
recent prior therapy. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Forty adults were enrolled in study PGAA2002 and all but one received at least one dose of the study 
drug.  Thus  39  patients  were  included  in  this  analysis  population.  Reasons  for  discontinuation  were 
progressive  disease  or  relapse  (n=14, 36%)  and  no  response  to  therapy  (n=14,  36%).  Three  patients 
(8%)  withdrew  due  to  adverse  events.  Two  (5%)  patients  completed  the  6  cycles  of  nelarabine 
treatment.

Conduct of the study 
The  protocol  was  amended  once,  to  reduce  the  dose  from  2200  mg/m2/day  to  1500  mg/m2/day,  to 
reduce the risk of neurotoxicity. In addition, patients with pre-existing grade 2 or greater neuropathy 
were deemed ineligible for enrolment. 
Baseline data 
Patients were assigned to two strata, based on the number of prior inductions (1 prior induction vs. ≥2 
prior inductions). Twenty-eight patients (72%)  had  undergone ≥2  prior attempts  at induction and 11 
(28%)  had  received  1  prior  induction  (see  table  14).  Most  patients  were  male  (82%)  and  most  were 
white (69%). Median and mean age at the time of the study entry were 34 and 35 years, respectively. 
The age range was 16 to 66 years for all treated patients and 16 to 65 years for patients with ≥2 prior 
inductions. Thirty-three patients (85%) were >21 years of age at the time of enrolment.

Outcomes and estimation 
Response rate 
A total of 5/28 (18%) patients with ≥2 prior inductions achieved a CR (confirmed one month later).  
One additional patient had no evidence of disease and achieved full hematologic recovery.  However, 
this  response  was  of  short  duration  and,  therefore,  did  not  meet  the  definition  of  CR.  This  patient’s 
best response was a CR*. Thus, 6 (21%) patients with ≥2 prior inductions achieved at least a CR*. 
A total of 2/11 (18%) patients with 1 prior induction achieved a CR (confirmed one month later).  One 
additional  patient  withdrew  without  demonstrating  platelet  and  absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC) 
recovery in order to receive a cord blood transplant. Thus, the CR* rate was 27% for patients with 1 
prior induction (see table 16).

Eleven of 26 patients (42%) with ALL and 5/13 patients (38%) with LBL experienced responses (CR 
+  PR).  Of  the  28  patients  with  ≥2  prior  inductions,  17  failed  to  respond  (<CR)  to  their  most  recent 
induction  regimen.  Of  those,  3  (18%)  patients  experienced  a  complete  response  with  nelarabine 
(confirmed 1 month later). Of the 2/11 patients who failed to respond to their single prior induction, 
none did respond to nelarabine. 
Duration of response 
The  duration  of CR  of six patients with ≥ 2 prior remission inductions ranged from 15.1 to > 195.4 
weeks. One additional patient achieved CR* lasting for 4 weeks. Two patients were still in remission 
at the date of last contact. One of these patients proceeded to a pre-SCT conditioning regimen while 
still  in  a  nelarabine-induced  CR  and  remained  in  a  CR  for  at  least  156.3  weeks.  Another  patient 
remained  in  a  prolonged  CR  (195.4+  weeks)  without  subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy  following 
treatment  with  3  cycles  of  nelarabine.  Prior  to  enrolment,  this  patient  had  relapsed  after  two 
multi-agent induction regimens, surgical resection and autologous stem cell transplantation.  
Three  patients  who  had  1  prior  induction  achieved  a  CR  but  did  not  receive  a  transplant.  Their 
durations of response lasted 212, 29.4, and 18.9 weeks.

Survival 
Eighteen  percent  of  patients  who  received  1  prior  induction,  and  11%  of  patients  who  received  ≥2 
prior inductions were censored. The survival curves for the two prior induction groups are shown in 
Figure 3. The one year survival rate for all treated patients was 31% with a 95% CI of 16% to 45%. Of 
the 28 subjects with ≥2 prior inductions, 8 (29%) were alive at one year (see table 18).

Post nelarabine transplants and engraftment 
Upon  request  from  FDA,  engraftment  data  were  retrospectively  collected  from  participating 
institutions that performed transplants on patients enrolled in study PGAA2002. Seven patients went 
on to transplant. Engraftment data for 6/7 patients were collected and entered into the database. Two 
patients who did not respond to nelarabine subsequently received BMTs. 
Myeloid engraftment occurred in 3/7 transplanted patients on days 10, 11 and 18 post-transplant. One 
patient died shortly after transplant before engrafting. Engraftment data for one patient were unknown. 
Myeloid engraftment was not reported in the remaining two transplanted patients. Both were alive < 3 
years after transplant, indicating engraftment had occurred at some unknown time. 
•  Supportive study 
Treatment  Referral  Center  Protocol  (TRC  9701),  was  a  phase  II,  open-label  multi-centre  study  to 
investigate the safety and efficacy of nelarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell ALL or 
T-cell  LBL.  The  study  was  conducted  by  NCI,  CTEP.  It  was  ongoing  at  the  time  of  the  marketing 
authorisation application. On 28 January 2005, 26 patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL/T-LBL 
had been treated, 24 of whom were evaluable for response: 3/24 CRs had been reported (CR rate of 
12.5%).

An expert report on the results of an interim analysis of an ongoing collaborative research trial with 
nelarabine (GMALL study 06/99 and study 07/03) was provided during the assessment. A total of 68 
patients  received  nelarabine  650mg/m2  on  days  1-5  (adolescents  15-17  years)  or  nelarabine 
1500mg/m2 on days 1, 3 and 5 (adults). Patients suffered from T-ALL or T-LBL which was primary 
refractory,  refractory  to  at  least  two  induction  regimens,  or  had  relapsed  following  stem  cell 
transplantation.  Complete  responses  were  achieved  in  30  patients  (44%),  with  an  unconfirmed 
complete response in an additional patient; 77% (24/31) of these patients were transferred to stem cell 
transplantation with 29% survival at 3 years. 
•  Analysis performed across trials and studies in special populations 
No Analysis across trials or studies in special populations was provided in this application. 
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In  paediatric  patients,  since  the  maximal  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  could  not  be  determined  (lack  of 
available patients) for the daily dosing for 3 consecutive days schedule and the alternate-day schedule 
(phase  I  studies  PGAA1002,  PGAA1003),  the  5  consecutive  day  schedule  was  selected  and  further 
investigated in the paediatric phase II pivotal study. During this study, the initial dose of 1200 mg/m2 
was later reduced to 650 mg/m2 due to grade 4 neurotoxicity. In adult patients, the day 1, 3, 5 schedule 
was preferred, based on the benefit-risk ratio observed in phase I studies. 
Both  dosing  schedules  were  studied  in  patients  16  to  21  years  of  age,  as  patients  in  this  age  range 
could  enrol  in  either  the  adult  (study  PGAA2002)  or  paediatric  (study  PGAA2001)  pivotal  phase  II 
studies.  In  study  PGAA2002,  6/39  patients  who  were  treated  with  1500  mg/m2  on  the  day  1,  3,  5 
schedule were 16 to 21 years of age (range: 16-66 years; mean: 35 years). In study PGAA2001, 10/84 
patients who received a dose of 650 mg/m2 given daily x5 were 16 to 21 years of age (range: 2.5 to 
21.7 years; mean: 11.9 years). Dose recommendations are reflected in section 4.2 of the SPC. 
The  application  was  based  on  two  phase  II  open-label  studies  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of 
nelarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL/T-LBL.  
Study  PGAA2002  was  performed  in  patients  ≥  16  years  of  age  with  refractory  or  recurrent  T-ALL 
(67%  of  patients)  or  T-LBL  (33%  of  patients),  and  received  1500  mg/m2  of  nelarabine  as  an  IV 
infusion over 2 hours, on days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21 day cycle. The primary endpoint was response rate 
i.e., complete response (CR defined as no evidence of remaining tumour, and haematological recovery 
within one month after remission induction treatment), and partial response (PR). Of the 39  patients 
who  received  nelarabine,  19  patients  (49%)  were  refractory  to  their  most  recent  prior  induction 
therapy, 31% had isolated bone marrow disease at baseline, 11% had a history of CNS leukaemia.  
Among the 28 patients with ≥2 prior inductions, 5 (18%) achieved a CR and 6 (21%) achieved at least 
a CR*. Among the 11 patients with 1 prior induction, 2 (18%) achieved a CR and 3 (27%) achieved a 
CR*. Response (CR + PR) was observed in 11/26 (42%) patients with ALL and 5/13 (38%) patients 
with LBL. The duration of CR and CR* ranged from 15.1 to 212.0 weeks, and from 4 to 215 weeks, 
respectively. The median survival was 20.1 weeks (95% CI: 12.0 to 220 weeks) for patients with one 
prior induction, 20.6 weeks (95% CI: 10.4 to 36.4 weeks) for patients with ≥2 prior inductions, 20.4 
weeks (95% CI: 12.9 to 36.4 weeks) for all treated patients. 
CR rate was considered as a relevant endpoint for approval. The CHMP considers that only CR, or at 
least a very substantial reduction in leukaemic blasts, is of therapeutic interest for new antileukaemic 
agent  used  in  second-  or  third  line  therapy,  and  that  achievement  of  CR  should  be  followed  by 
additional  chemotherapy  and/or  SCT  when  feasible.  However,  only  one  patient  received  a  stem  cell 
transplantation and had a CR of 156+ weeks at the latest follow-up. One patient received a SCT during 
early  relapse  after  nelarabine  and  later  died  of  graft-versus-host  disease.  Without  observing  the 
outcome of transplantation, the question of unpredicted post-transplantation toxicities caused by prior 
exposure  to  nelarabine  was  raised.  The  results  of  an  interim  analysis  of  an  ongoing  collaborative 
research trial conducted in 68 patients (expert report provided) showed that 24 patients with CR went 
on to stem cell transplantation and 29% of these patients were alive after 3 years. These data support 
that stem cell transplantation is feasible after nelarabine treatment and there are no indications that the 
substance adversely affects the outcome of the transplantation.

The duration of CR observed in study PGAA2002 was considered clinically relevant as it would give 
patients a good chance to find an unrelated donor for stem cell transplantation. 
Patients  with  active  CNS  disease  (evidence  of  CNS  leukaemia  and/or  lymphoma  that  would  require 
intrathecal or craniospinal radiation therapy) and patients with pre-existing neuropathy of grade 2 or 
greater at the time of registration regardless of case were not eligible for study PGA2002. A warning 
was included in section 4.4 of the SPC for patients treated previously or concurrently with intrathecal 
chemotherapy or previously with craniospinal irradiation, as these patients are potentially at increased 
risk  for  neurological  adverse  events  (see  also  safety  assessment).  In  addition,  dose  modification 
recommendations are included in section 4.2 of the SPC in case of neurological events.  
Study PGAA2001 was conducted in patients ≤21 years of age with refractory or recurrent T-ALL or 
T-LBL, and a predicted life expectancy of ≥ 8weeks. The starting dose of 1200 mg/m2 was reduced to 
900 mg/m2 due to grade 4 neurotoxicity, and then to 650 mg/m due to reports of Guillain-Barre-like 
syndrome.  The  primary  endpoint  was  response  rate  i.e.,  complete  response  (CR)  defined  as  no 
evidence  of  remaining,  and  partial  response  (PR).  Partial  response  was  observed  in  24/70  (34%) 
paediatric  patients,  and  18  (26%)  reached  CR.  Within  the  population  that  responded,  the  number  of 
prior remission induction therapies did not show an impact on the efficacy of nelarabine. In the group 
of patients with ≥2 prior inductions, 4/9 patients who reached CR* received SCT.  
The  supportive  data  provided  (expert report from  an external investigator),  although  only applicable 
for an adult patient population (19-81 years), indicated the option for successful treatment with stem 
cell transplantation following treatment with nelarabine. 
Clinical safety 
•  Patient exposure 
Safety data for nelarabine have been derived from four phase I studies (181 patients) and three pivotal 
phase II studies (227 patients). Altogether 459 patients, including 329 men and 130 women, from 0.6 
to  83  years,  with  ALL  (41%),  CLL  (26%),  and  LBL  (15%),  were  included  in  the  safety  analysis. 
Supportive data from 522 patients from NCI studies, which were ongoing or just completed at the time 
of the assessment, were also were also included in this analysis (see summary table 19).  
Separate analyses were provided from the phase II pivotal studies PGAA2001 (84 paediatric patients 
receiving 650 mg/m2 on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle) and PGAA2002, and pivotal safety phase II study 
PGAA2003 study (103 adult patients with refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia receiving 1500 
mg/m2  on  days  1,  3,  and  5  of  a  21-day  cycle).  Study  PGAA2002  included  39  adult  patients.  In  the 
safety  analysis  3  patients  were  withdrawn.  These  patients  received  the  2200  mg/m2  dose  regimen, 
which was later reduced to the recommended 1500 mg/m2 dose regimen due to neurotoxicity reported 
in study PGAA2003. Similarly, study PGAA2003 included 87 adult patients, of whom 67 received the 
recommended  1500  mg/m2  dose  regimen  and  were  included  in  the  safety  analysis.  In  study 
PGAA2003, the starting dose was reduced by protocol amendment from 2200 to 1500 mg/m2 after 2 
of the first  20  patients had SAEs  of ascending  sensory  neuropathies,  one grade  3  demyelisation  and 
one  grade  3  paresthesia.  Administration  of  doses  was  delayed  because  of  haematological  toxicity, 
infection, inter-current illness, and at the discretion of the investigator. 
In  the  adult  phase  II  studies,  the  mean  number  of  days  on  therapy  was  76.5.  Most  patients  (72%) 
received  treatment  with  nelarabine  for  at  least  2  cycles;  6%  of  patients  in  study  PGA2002  and 
PGAA2003 received a total of 6 cycles.  
In  the  paediatric  study,  the  mean  number  of  days  on  therapy  for  the  650  mg/m2  dose  group  was  60 
days in stratum 01 and 46 days in stratum 02. The maximum number of days on therapy was 301 in 
the 900 mg/m2 dose group in stratum 02.

•  Adverse events  
In the pivotal studies conducted in adults patients (PGAA2002 and PGAA2003) receiving nelarabine 
1500 mg/m2, most patients (90%) had at least 1 possibly drug-related adverse event (ADR) (see table 
20). The most common drug-related AEs were fatigue (39%), nausea (31%) and hematological 
disorders; i.e., decreased hemoglobin (25%), decreased platelet count (21%), and decreased neutrophil 
count (20%), and somnolence (20%). Notable differences between study PGAA2002 and study 
PGAA2003 included hematological disorders, such as decreased hemoglobin (72% vs. 0%), decreased 
neutrophil count (58% vs. 0%), and decreased platelet count (61% vs. 0%) and nervous disorders, such 
as somnolence (0% vs. 31%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (33% vs. 0%), asthenia (0% vs. 25%), 
hypo-aesthesia (0% vs. 24%), paresthesia (0% vs. 16%), and somnolence (0% vs. 31%). Those 
differences between studies in the incidences of these events could be explained by the differences in 
reporting procedures.

In the paediatric studies, the majority of ADRs were hematological abnormalities (see table 21). Of the 
non-hematological AEs, the two most frequent ADRs reported at the 650 mg/m2 dose were increased 
transaminase (12%), decreased blood potassium (11%), vomiting (10%), and decreased blood albumin 
(10%).

Nervous system ADRs 
The  most common nervous system ADRs in the adult phase II studies for patients who received the 
1500 mg/m2 dose were somnolence (20%), dizziness (17%), hypo-aesthesia (16%), peripheral sensory 
neuropathy  (12%),  paresthesia  (11%),  and  ataxia  (8%).  With  the  exception  of  peripheral  motor 
neuropathy (0 in women, 8% in men), peripheral sensory neuropathy (4% in women, 15% in men) and 
headache (14% in women, 4% in men), the incidence of nervous system ADRs did not appear to vary 
according  to  gender.  Most  nervous  system  ADRs  were  evaluated  as  grade  1  or  2.  Grade  3  events 
(ataxia  (N=2),  convulsion  (N=1),  hemiparesis  (N=1),  hypoesthesia  (N=2),  loss  of  consciousness 
(N=1),  peripheral  neuropathy  (N=1)  were  reported  for  7%  in  patients  and  grade  4  events  (cerebral 
haemorrhage  (N=1),  coma  (N=1),  depressed  level  of  consciousness  (N=1),  intracranial  haemorrhage 
(N=1), leukencephalopathy (N=1) were reported for 2% in patients.  
In  the  pivotal  paediatric  study  PGAA2001,  at  least  one  nervous  system  AER  was  reported  in  48 
patients (32%); 80% of nervous system disorders were resolved and 19% did not resolved. Because of 
the  rather  short  survival  time,  the  long-term  consequences  could  not  be  given.  The  most  frequent 
nervous  system  ADR  in  the  650  mg/m2  dose  group  were  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (6%), 
headache (5%), somnolence (5%), hypoesthesia (5%), and peripheral neuropathy (5%).

Additional exploratory neurotoxicity analysis 
Exploratory  analyses  were  undertaken  using  the  integrated  database  for  the  four  phases  I  and  three 
phase  II  trials  to  identify predisposing  factors  associated  with  neurological  events.  The  results  show 
that  neurological  AEs  were  reported  for  267  of  the  459  subjects  evaluated.  Most  were  grade  2  or 
lower.  The  most  prevalent  grade  ≥3  neurological  events  were  ataxia  (3%)  and  somnolence  (3%), 
followed by peripheral neuropathy (2%), hypoesthesia (2%), confusional state (2%), convulsion (2%), 
and abnormal gait (2%).

Possible risk factors were found to be related to the occurrence of neurological events. These included 
increase  in  prescribed  cycle  dose  in  mg/m2  and  any  event  (any  grade  and  grade  ≥3),  mental  status 
change (MSC, any grade), and peripheral nervous system (PNS, any grade); increase in age and any 
event  (any  grade),  MSC  (any  grade),  CNS  (any  grade),  and  PNS  (any  grade);  and  CNS  disease  at 
baseline and any event (grade ≥3), CNS (grade ≥3), and PNS (grade ≥3). 
•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In  the  adult  pivotal  phase  II  studies  for  patients  who  received  1500  mg/m2  of  nelarabine,  serious 
ADRs  that  occurred  in  more  than  one  patient  included  pyrexia  (5%),  febrile  neutropenia  (3%), 
dehydration (3%), pneumonia (2%), pancytopenia (2%), and ataxia (2%).  
In the pivotal paediatric study, serious ADRs were reported in 16% (24/151) of patients across doses. 
Peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (n=5,  6%),  hypoesthesia  (n=3,  4%),  convulsion  (n=2,  2%),  and 
peripheral  motor neuropathy (n=2, 2%). were the  most frequently reported serious ADRs in the 650 
mg/m2 dose group.

Serious  nervous  system  events  were  reported  for  8%  of  the  adult  patients  who  received  the 
1500 mg/m2 dose in the pivotal Phase 2 studies. None of the serious nervous system events occurred in 
more  than  2  patients.  In  the  pivotal  study  in  paediatric  patients,  at  the  650 mg/m2  dose,  the  most 
common  serious  nervous  system  events  were  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (6%),  convulsion  (4%), 
and hypoesthesia (4%).  
Deaths 
Ten adult patients (10%) who received the 1500 mg/m2 dose died within 30 days of administration of 
the last dose in the pivotal phase II studies. Relapse or progression of CLL was the only cause of death 
in  more  than  1  patient.  All  deaths  due  to  relapse  or  progression  of  CLL  (n=3)  occurred  in  the 
PGAA2003 study. In study PGAA2002, deaths that were not related to the disease or treatment were 
to be recorded as “other” and then specified by the investigator, whereas in study PGAA2003, choices 
of cause of death on the death record were relapse/progression and “other.” 
Deaths of children in the pivotal study were reported for 28% of patients at the 900 mg/m2 dose, 10% 
of  patients  ects  at  the  650  mg/m2  dose,  and  16%  of  patients  at  the  400  mg/m2  dose  either  during 
treatment or within 30 days of administration of the last dose of nelarabine. The cause of death across 
doses is summarized in the table 24.

•  Laboratory findings 
Grade  3  and  4  clinical  chemistry  values  were  observed  in  8%  to  15%  of  adult  patients.  The  most 
common clinical chemistry abnormalities reported were hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, 
hyponatremia,  and  elevated  aspartate  transaminase  (AST).  A  similar  pattern  was  observed  for 
paediatric patients, with the exception of hypokalemia, which was reported in 18/40 (45%) subjects.  
These  adverse  events  were  generally  not  considered  dose-limiting  by  the  investigators.  Multiple 
factors such as concurrent drug therapy, underlying disease processes, and concurrent illness may have 
contributed  to  the  alterations  in  clinical  chemistry  values.  The  safety  of  nelarabine  in  the  paediatric 
population  was  characterized  by  expected  haematological  ADRs.  The  most  reported  non-
haematological AEs reported at the 650 mg/m2 dose were headache (17%) and increased transaminase 
levels (12%).  
Case findings 
Case reports containing grade 2 or higher neurological AEs were reviewed to gain additional insight 
from  patients  who  experienced  neurological  events.  Imaging  (MRI),  Computed  Tomography  (CT), 
lumbar  puncture,  electroencephalogram  (EEG),  electromyogram  (EMG)/Nerve  Conduction  Velocity 
(NCV).  A  total  of  70  subject  case  reports  that  contained  objective  neurological  test  results  were 
analysed.  
The reports demonstrated that multiple neurological events can be observed in an individual and span 
the peripheral nervous system, the central nervous system, and include mental status changes. These

events were not always reversible and could be fatal. Several cases, clinically reported as PNS events, 
were found to involve some central demyelisation. When the peripheral nervous system is  involved, 
there  can  be  both  axonal  and  demyelinative  features.  Some  reports  describe  a  severe  demyelinative 
picture  that  resembles  Guillain-Barré  Syndrome.  There  was  also  evidence  of  central  demyelisation, 
primarily  involving  the  cervical  and  thoracic  cord.  In  one  case,  this  demyelisation  pathologically 
involved the white matter tracts in a pattern like that seen in reports of vitamin B12 deficiency. The 
spinal  MRI  scan  descriptions  were  also  consistent  with  the  involvement  expected  with  vitamin  B12 
deficiency.  
•  Safety in special populations 
Subgroup  analyses  for  intrinsic  factors  did  not  show any  particular  safety  concerns  regarding  ethnic 
group  or  gender.  Subgroup  analyses  for  extrinsic  (environmental)  factors  were  not  performed. 
Nelarabine  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic  impaired  function.  Nelarabine  was 
administered  to  a  limited  number  of  patients  aged  ≥  65  years  old.  In  an  exploratory  analysis, 
increasing age, especially aged 65 years and older, appeared to be associated with increased rates of 
neurological adverse events. 
No cases of overdose with nelarabine were reported. There is no evidence of any potential for abuse or 
dependence.  In  clinical  trials,  nelarabine  was  administered  up  to  75  mg/kg  (approximately  2250 
mg/m2) daily for 5 days to 1 paediatric patient, up to 60 mg/kg (approximately 2400 mg/m2) daily for 
5 days to 5 adult patients and up to 2900 mg/m2 on days 1, 3, 5 to two adult patients. At a dose of 2200 
mg/m2  given  on  days  1,  3,  and  5  every  21  days,  2  patients  developed  a  grade  3  ascending  sensory 
neuropathy.  MRI  evaluations  of  the  two  patients  demonstrated  findings  consistent  with  a 
demyelisation process in the cervical spine. 
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The  results  of  a  combination  study  with  nelarabine  and  fludarabine  showed  that  fludarabine 
administration before nelarabine administration on day 3 did not affect the intracellular accumulation 
of ara-GTP. The safety profile of nelarabine combined with fludarabine (nelarabine on days 1, 3, and 5 
and fludarabine on days 3 and 5) was similar that of the two drugs administered individually. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study PGAA2002, three patients were  withdrawn from  the  study due to AEs, including nephrotic 
range  proteinuria  (n=1)  unrelated  to  nelarabine,  and  grade  2  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (n=2) 
considered  to  be  related  to  nelarabine  (study  PGAA2002).  In  study  PGAA2003,  28  patients  were 
withdrawn due to one or more AEs. Nervous system AEs were the most frequent class of AEs that led 
to  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  These  included  hypo-aesthesia  and  peripheral  neuropathy,  each 
reported for 6% of patients who received the 1500 mg/m2 starting dose. In the pivotal paediatric study 
PGAA2001,  14  patients  had  neurological  AEs  that  led  to  withdrawal  from  the  study.  Peripheral 
(sensory)  neuropathy  (n=5),  hypo-aesthesia  (n=3),  ataxia  (n=3),  and  asthenia  (n=3)  were  most 
commonly reported AEs as either the primary or secondary reasons for withdrawal from the study.  
•  Post marketing experience 
At the time of the assessment by the CHMP, nelarabine had been authorised in the United States, and 
no regulatory actions for safety reasons had had to been taken since its authorisation on the US market. 
No data was received that would indicate a different safety profile as the one stated in the SPC. 
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  evaluation  of  nelarabine  was  based  on  459  adult  and  paediatric  patients  who  received 
nelarabine  within  four  phases  I  studies  and  three  pivotal  phase  II  studies.  The  most  common  drug-
related adverse events were haematological and gastrointestinal adverse effects. The most concerning 
(dose-limiting) toxicity of nelarabine was neurologic adverse drug reactions. 
38/44  
© EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In adult patients receiving nelarabine 1500 mg/m2, the safety profile in terms of haematological and 
gastrointestinal effects was comparable to the other cytotoxic agents. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
anaemia,  and  neutropenia,  (including  febrile  neutropenia)  were  associated  with  nelarabine  therapy. 
The SPC recommends that complete blood counts including platelets are monitored regularly (see SPC 
sections  4.2,  4.4  and  4.8).  Neurological  adverse  events  were  reported  in  8%  of  the  adult  patients 
involved  in  the  two  pivotal  studies  PGAA2002  and  PGAA2003.  Grade  3  events  (ataxia:  N=2; 
convulsion:  N=1;  hemiparesis:  (N=1);  hypoesthesia:  N=2;  loss  of  consciousness:  N=1;  peripheral 
neuropathy: N=1) were reported in 7% of the patients and grade 4 events (cerebral haemorrhage: N=1; 
coma:  N=1),  depressed 
intracranial  haemorrhage:  N=1; 
level  of  consciousness:  N=1; 
leukencephalopathy: N=1) were reported in 2% of the patients.  
In  paediatric  patients  receiving  nelarbine  650  mg/m2  (n=84),  haematological  toxicities  (i.e.  adverse 
events and/or abnormal laboratory values) were observed in 99% of patients. Eight (6%) patients died 
within  30  days  after  initiation  of  nelarabine  treatment.  No  deaths  were  considered  due  to  nelarabine 
alone. However, 4/151 (3%) patients (including 1 patient in the 400 mg/m2 group, 1 in the 650 mg/m2 
group,  and  2  in  the  900  mg/m2  group)  had  an  outcome  of  death  considered  to  be  at  least  possibly 
related  to  nelarabine.  The  other  deaths  were  related  to  tumour.  More  neurological  events  were 
observed  in  paediatric  patients  (20%  of  patients  in  the  650  mg/m2  group)  than  in  adults.  The  most 
common severe neurological events were peripheral sensory neuropathy (6%), convulsion (4%), and 
hypo-aesthesia (4%). Ascending peripheral neuropathy could be severe, resulting in diminished motor 
control;  6%  of  patients  had  seizure  or  related  term  serious  adverse  events.  One  patient  experienced 
status epilepticus possibly related to treatment with nelarabine and died due to multiple causes.  
Overall,  nervous  system  serious  ADRs  were  reported  in  14%  of  patients  across  studies.  Among  the 
459 patients in the safety database, 13% experienced a grade 3 neurological adverse event and 7% a 
grade  4  neurological  adverse  event.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  nelarabine-induced  neurological 
toxicity could not be explained. The effect of nelarabine to neuronal cells is the clinical spectrum of 
chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity and could be characterised as central, peripheral or both. It may 
involve astrocyte dysfunction in maintaining a supportive environment for neuronal homeostasis. 
A Guillain-Barré like syndrome was observed in phase I study PGAA1001 (dosing for 5 consecutive 
days)  in  5  of  93  patients.  The  polyradiculopathy  behaved  as  a  chronic  demyelating  neuropathy  and 
was  not reversible.  One  of the five cases  occurred at the 1200  mg/m2  dose  (adult  patient).  All other 
cases occurred at doses greater than 1200 mg/m2. Full recovery from neurotoxic events did not always 
occurred with cessation of nelarabine. It is advised, in the SPC (see sections 4.2 and 4.4) that patients 
undergoing  therapy  with  nelarabine  be  closely  observed  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  neurological 
toxicity. Moreover, it is recommended that nelarabine is discontinued at the first sign of neurological 
events of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Event Grade 2 or greater. 
Patients  treated  previously  or  concurrently  with  intrathecal  chemotherapy  or  previously  with 
craniospinal  irradiation  is  potentially  at  increased  risk  for  neurological  adverse  events  (see  section 
4.2). 
Infection  (including  but  not  limited  to  sepsis,  bacteraemia,  pneumonia,  fungal  infection)  was  a  very 
common adverse drug reaction. There was a single additional report of biopsy confirmed progressive 
multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  in  the  adult  population.  There  have  been  reports  of  sometimes  fatal 
opportunistic infections in patients receiving nelarabine therapy (see SPC section 4.8). 
In  addition  to  the  adverse  reactions  seen  in  the  pivotal  clinical  trials,  there  are  also  data  from  875 
patients  from  NCI  studies/compassionate  use  programme  (694  patients)  and  Phase  I  (181  patients) 
studies of nelarabine. In these studies, neoplasms benign and malignant (including cysts and polyps) 
and  7  cases  of  tumour  lysis  syndrome  were  observed.  Intravenous  hydration  according  to  standard 
medical practice for the management of hyperuricemia is recommended in patients at risk for tumour 
lysis syndrome. For patients at risk of hyperuricemia, the use of allopurinol should be considered (see 
SPC section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Clinical  studies  of  nelarabine  did  not  include  sufficient  numbers  of  patients  aged  65  and  over  to 
determine whether they respond differently from younger patients (see SPC section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Nelarabine  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  These  patients  must  be  closely 
monitored  for  toxicities  when  treated  with  nelarabine  (see  SPC  section  4.2  and  5.2).  Nelarabine  has 
not  been  studied  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment.  These  patients  should  be  treated  with  caution 
(see SPC section 4.2).

No cases of overdose with nelarabine have been reported. It is likely that nelarabine overdose would 
result in severe neurotoxicity (possibly including paralysis, coma); myelosuppression and potentially 
death  (see  SPC  section  4.9).  There  is  no  known  antidote  for  nelarabine  overdose.  Supportive  care 
consistent with good clinical practice should be provided.  
No  studies  on  the  effects  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines  have  been  performed.  Patients 
treated with nelarabine are potentially at risk of suffering from somnolence during and for several days 
after  treatment.  A  statement  has  been  included  in  section  4.7  of  the  SPC  to  inform  patients  that 
somnolence can affect performance of skilled tasks, such as driving.

6.  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The  Quality  of  this  product  was  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance  of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way.  At  the 
time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  was  a  minor  unresolved  quality  issue  having  no  impact  on  the 
benefit/risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a letter of undertaking and committed to resolve 
this as follow-up measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe. 
There  were  no  issues  concerning  the  non-clinical  pharmacology  or  the  toxicology  of  nelarabine  that 
negatively affected the overall benefit-risk assessment.

Efficacy 
The application was based on two uncontrolled, open-label, phase II trials, in adult (PGAA2002) and 
paediatric  (PGAA2001)  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  T-cell  lineage  ALL/LBL,  receiving 
nelarabine as single agent.  
Among 39 adult patients treated with nelarabine 1500 mg/m2 (days 1, 3, 5, repeated every 21 days), 
five patients  having  received  more than  2 prior  inductions, and  two patients having received 1 prior 
induction, experienced a complete response (CR:18%, 95%CI [6% - 37%] and CR:18%, 95%CI [2%, 
52%], respectively). Nine patients (23%) had a complete response with no evidence of disease with or 
without  hematologic recovery (CR*). Among these 9 patients,  seven  went  on  to achieve a  complete 
response with full hematologic recovery (CR) and two had a best response of CR*.  
Duration of CR was 51 and 212 weeks in two patients having received one prior induction, and ranged 
from  15.1  to  at  least  195.4  weeks  in  five  patients  having  received  two  or  more  prior  inductions.  
Duration  of  CR*  ranged  from  4.7  to  215  weeks,  and  4  to  at  least  195.4  weeks  in  patients  having 
received  one  prior,  or  at  least  two  prior  inductions,  respectively.  These  durations  were  sufficiently 
long  for  a  patients  to  proceed  to  transplant  (4-8  weeks  according  to  most  guidelines).  The  median 
survival  was  20.1  weeks  for  patients  having  received  1  prior  induction  and  20.6 weeks  for  patients 
having received more than prior inductions. The one year survival rate for all treated patients was 31% 
(95% CI: 16% - 45%).  
Among the 22 paediatric patients with highly refractory disease that did not respond to the most recent 
induction  regimen,  and  who  received  the  recommended  dose  (650  mg/m2,  one  hour  daily  for  5 
consecutive days, repeated every 21 days), 18% (4/22) of patients achieved a CR with nelarabine and 
remained  in  continuous  complete  remission  for  4.7  to  36.4  weeks.  Three  of  these  patients  received 
allogeneic  bone  marrow  transplant  during  the  remission  period.  Survival  ranged  from  16.6  to  57.4 
weeks in the four highly refractory subjects who achieved CR. 
Safety 
The  safety  profile  of  nelarabine  was  based  on  the  data  from  the  pivotal  trials,  which  involved  103 
adults and 84 paediatric patients receiving nelarabine at the recommended doses of 1,500 mg/m 2 and 
650 mg/m  2,  respectively.  The  most  frequent  adverse  events  were  fatigue,  gastrointestinal  disorders, 
haematological disorders, respiratory disorders, nervous system disorders, and pyrexia.  
Neurological toxicity is the dose-limiting toxicity of nelarabine. Despite an extensive phase I program, 
the dose had to be further decreased in both adults and children early in the phase II program. Children 
were more sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of nelarabine and although dose-adjustments were made, 
more  than  one  third  of  the  pediatric  population  experienced  at  least  one  neurological  adverse  event. 
These  events  included  altered  mental  states  including  severe  somnolence,  central  nervous  system 
effects including convulsions, and peripheral neuropathy ranging from numbness and paresthesias to 
motor weakness and paralysis. There were also reports of events associated with demyelination, and 
ascending  peripheral  neuropathies  similar  in  appearance  to  Guillain-Barré  Syndrome.  Full  recovery 
from these events did not always occurred with cessation  of nelarabine. Therefore, close monitoring 
for neurological events is strongly recommended in the SPC, where dose modification and treatment 
discontinuation  guidance  are  provided.  An  explorative  analysis  was  performed  by  the  applicant  to 
identify risk factors of neurotoxicity, however, the very limited safety database and the retrospective 
nature  of  the  data  collection  necessitates  a  more  stringent  post-marketing  follow-up  than  what  is 
expected  in  routine  pharmacovigilance  safety  reports  (see  post-marketing  specific  obligations  in  the 
benefit risk section).  
In  addition  to  the  adverse  reactions  seen  in  the  pivotal  clinical  trials,  there  are  also  data  from  875 
patients  from  NCI  studies/compassionate  use  programme  (694  patients)  and  Phase  I  (181  patients) 
studies of nelarabine. In these studies, neoplasms benign and malignant (including cysts and polyps) 
and  7  cases  of  tumour  lysis  syndrome  were  observed.  Cases  of  rhabdomyolysis  and  increased  CPK 
values were noted, and these events are being monitored closely. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. 
•  User consultation 
The Applicant performed a user consultation testing on the package leaflet. The design of the test 
formed the basis of an adequate and competent testing of the PIL in regard to finding, diagnosing and 
amending possible weaknesses.  The present readability test was well designed to meet its main 
objectives. The results showed that the user test met the guideline benchmark with 18 out of 20 people 
being able to locate each question and 18 out of 20 able to correctly answer. The results of the user 
testing described in the user testing report support the changes made to the PIL. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
According  to  CHMP  guidelines,  this  full  application  should  have  been  based  on  data  generated  by 
randomised, controlled clinical trials rather than by open-label, non-comparator studies. However the 
lack of randomized trial in this very heavily treated population is justified in view of the small size of 
the population of patients in second relapse. Furthermore, even in the absence of adequately controlled 
trials, nelarabine treatment achieved meaningful response rate and duration of response in a significant 
proportion  of  adult  and  pediatric  patients,  whose  disease  has  not  responded  to  or  has  relapsed 
following  treatment  with  at  least  two  chemotherapy  regimens.  The  magnitude  of  the  response  was 
clinically relevant, allowing some patients to undergo a stem cell transplantation. 
The safety profile of nelarabine was not very different from other nucleoside analogues. As expected 
myelosuppression  with  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  was  the  most  common  toxicity,  which  is 
probably unavoidable in the setting of leukaemia treatment.  
An  important  identified  risk  was  the  dose-limiting  neurotoxicity  of  nelarabine.  Grade  3  and  4 
neurotoxicity  was  frequent  in  clinical  trials  (19%  of  paediatric  patients  and  13%  of  adult  patients). 
Adequate  information  has  been  provided  in  the  SPC  to  help  treating  physicians  to  minimise  the 
incidence  and  severity  of  haematological  and  neurological  toxicity.  However,  regarding  the  safety 
profile  of  nelarbine  there  are  still  uncertainties,  especially  in  terms  of  long  term  neurotoxicity  in 
paediatric patients, due to the limited size of the safety database. This is justified in view of the small 
size of the population of patients in second relapse, but requires for the applicant to introduce specific 
investigations  concerning  the  safety  of  the  product.  A  risk  management  plan  was  submitted.  The 
CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that pharmacovigilance activities in 
addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety 
concerns. The CHMP agreed that the following additional data to be provided as specific obligations 
were required:  
(cid:131)  The marketing authorisation holder was required to better define the safety profile of nelarabine 
incorporated into multiagent regimens including (prophylactic) treatment of CNS disease. To this 
end, the holder will provide post-marketing, data from an on-going phase III Children’s Oncology 
Group  study  AALL0434,  entitled  “intensified  methotrexate,  nelarabine  and  augmented  BFM 
therapy  for  children  and  young  adults  with  newly  diagnosed  T-cell  actute  lymphoblastic 
leukaemia”. 
(cid:131) 
In  order  to  expand  the  safety  database  of  nelarabine  in  children  regarding  neurological  adverse 
reactions, the marketing authorisation holder will provide data from a post-marketing surveillance 
study  for  Atriance  in  the  indicated  patient  population  under  21  years  of  age  receiving  the 
650mg/m2 dose of nelarabine. 
No  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information. 
In  conclusion,  there  is  sufficient  evidence  for  the  antileukaemic  activity  of  nelarabine  in  both 
paediatric  and  adult  patient.  The  effect  of  nelarabine,  in  terms  of  response  is  considered  clinically 
relevant  and  the  ultimate  goal  of  the  therapy,  stem  cell  transplantation,  seems  not  to  be  affected 
adversely by pre-treatment with nelarabine. There are still uncertainties due to the limited size of the 
safety  database  and  the  lack  of  a  randomised  controlled  efficacy  trial  to  demonstrate  the  effect  of 
nelarabine  on  overall  survival.  However,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  indication  for  which  the 
43/44  
© EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
medicinal  product  is  intended  is  encountered  so  rarely  that  the  applicant  cannot  reasonably  be 
expected to provide comprehensive data on the clinical efficacy and safety of the medicinal product. 
Therefore, the marketing authorisation should be granted under exceptional circumstances.  
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The  Applicant  has  provided  reports  discussing  the  issue  of  similarity  in  the  context  of  Art.  3  of 
Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  847/2000  as  regard  to  the  orphan  medicinal  products  Evoltra 
(clofarabine),  Sprycel  (dasatininb)  and  Glivec  (Imatinib)  which  have  been  granted  a  marketing 
authorisation  for  ALL  in  the  EU.    The  Applicant  claimed  that  Atriance  is  not  similar  to  any  of  the 
authorised Orphan medicinal products for a condition relating to the proposed therapeutic indication. 
The  CHMP  concluded  that,  having  considered  the  arguments  presented  by  the  applicant,  the 
Rapporteurs assessment, and the conclusions of the Quality working Party, there are differences in the 
mechanism of action of nelarabine and clofarabine. The two active substances are considered not to be 
similar  as  regards  mechanism  of  action  since  they  act  on  different  pharmacodynamic  targets  (DNA 
polymerases  α  and  β,  DNA  polymerases  α  and  ribonucleotide  reductase,  for  nelarabine  and 
clofarabine, respectively). However, the CHMP concluded that nelarabine and clofarabine are similar 
in  terms  of  molecular  structural  aspects  since  both  molecules  share  the  same  principal  molecular 
structural features and the changes in molecular structure are only minor. 
The  CHMP  also  concluded  that  there  are  substantial  differences  in  the  mechanism  of  action  of 
nelarabine and imatinib or dasatinib. Nelarabine and imatinib or dasatinib are not similar in terms of 
molecular structural aspects since both molecules do not share the same principal molecular structural 
features and the changes in molecular structure are not minor. 
Therefore,  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  Atriance  is  not  similar  to  any  authorised  orphan  medicinal 
products within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200 (See Appendix 
1). 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Atriance  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  T-cell  acute 
lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (T-ALL)  and  T-cell  lymphoblastic  lymphoma  (T-LBL)  whose  disease  has 
not  responded  to  or  has  relapsed  following  treatment  with  at  least  two  chemotherapy  regimens  was 
favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances. 
In addition, the CHMP, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation EC No 141/2000, considers Atriance 
not to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 847/2000) to authorised 
orphan medicinal products for the same therapeutic indication.

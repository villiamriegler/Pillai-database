CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Elonva is indicated for Controlled Ovarian Stimulation (COS) in combination with a Gonadotropin 
Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonist for the development of multiple follicles in women 
participating in an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) program. 
Elonva is indicated for the treatment of adolescent males (14 years and older) with hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism, in combination with human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Elonva for COS should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced 
in the treatment of fertility problems. 
Treatment with Elonva for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism should be initiated and supervised by a 
physician experienced in the treatment of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. 
Posology 
In the treatment of women of reproductive age, the dose of Elonva is based on weight and age.

The recommended doses of Elonva have only been established in a treatment cycle with a GnRH 
antagonist that was administered from stimulation day 5 or day 6 onwards (see sections 4.1, 4.4, and 
5.1). 
Stimulation day 1: 
Elonva should be administered as a single subcutaneous injection, preferably in the abdominal wall, 
during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. 
Stimulation day 5 or 6: 
Treatment with a GnRH antagonist should be started on stimulation day 5 or day 6 depending on the 
ovarian response, i.e. the number and size of growing follicles. The concurrent determination of serum 
oestradiol levels may also be useful. The GnRH antagonist is used to prevent premature Luteinising 
Hormone (LH) surges. 
Stimulation day 8: 
Seven days after the injection with Elonva on stimulation day 1, COS treatment may be continued 
with daily injections of (recombinant) Follicle Stimulating Hormone [(rec)FSH] until the criterion for 
triggering final oocyte maturation (3 follicles ≥ 17 mm) has been reached. The daily dose of (rec)FSH 
may depend on the ovarian response. In normal responders a daily dose of 150 IU (rec)FSH is advised. 
Administration of (rec)FSH on the day of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) administration can 
be omitted, depending on the ovarian response. In general, adequate follicular development is 
achieved on average by the ninth day of treatment (range 6 to 18 days). 
As soon as three follicles ≥ 17 mm are observed, a single injection of 5,000 up to 10,000 IU hCG is 
administered the same day or the day thereafter to induce final oocyte maturation. In case of an 
excessive ovarian response, see the recommendations given in section 4.4 in order to reduce the risk 
for developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No clinical studies have been performed in patients with renal insufficiency. Since the rate of 
elimination of corifollitropin alfa may be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency, the use of 
Elonva in these patients is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Although data in hepatically impaired patients are not available, hepatic impairment is unlikely to 
affect the elimination of corifollitropin alfa (see section 5.2).

Paediatric population 
In the treatment of adolescent males (14 years and older) with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the 
dose of Elonva is based on body weight. 
For adolescent males weighing less than or equal to 60 kg 
100 micrograms of Elonva once every two weeks for 12 weeks, followed by concomitant 
administration of Elonva (once every 2 weeks) with hCG. For patients initiating therapy with 
100 micrograms, consider increasing the dose if their body weight increases to greater than 60 kg 
during the course of treatment. 
For adolescent males weighing more than 60 kg 
150 micrograms of Elonva once every two weeks for 12 weeks, followed by concomitant 
administration of Elonva (once every 2 weeks) with hCG. 
Combination therapy with hCG twice weekly (500 – 5000 IU) may be necessary for 52 weeks or 
longer to achieve adult gonadal development. 
There are no data to support safety and efficacy when treatment is used for more than 52 weeks and/or 
after 17 years of age. 
Method of administration 
In females 
Subcutaneous injection of Elonva may be carried out by the woman herself or her partner, provided 
that proper instructions are given by the physician. Self administration of Elonva should only be 
performed by women who are well-motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice. 
Paediatric population 
In adolescent males (14 years and older) 
Subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall may be carried out by the patient or a caregiver, 
provided they have been appropriately trained. Elonva should be administered once every two weeks, 
in the morning on the same day of the week in combination with hCG twice weekly (500 – 5000 IU).

Infertility evaluation before starting treatment 
Before starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate. In particular, 
women should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical insufficiency, hyperprolactinemia and 
pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given. Medical conditions that 
contraindicate pregnancy should also be evaluated before starting treatment with Elonva. 
Dosing during the stimulation cycle 
Elonva is intended for single subcutaneous injection only. Additional injections of Elonva should not 
be given within the same treatment cycle. (See also section 4.2.) 
After administration of Elonva, no additional FSH-containing product should be administered prior to 
stimulation day 8 (see also section 4.2). 
Renal insufficiency 
In patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency the rate of elimination of corifollitropin 
alfa may be reduced (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Therefore, the use of Elonva in these patients is not 
recommended. 
Not recommended with a GnRH agonist protocol in women undergoing ART 
There are limited data on the use of Elonva in combination with a GnRH agonist. Results of a small 
uncontrolled study suggest a higher ovarian response than in combination with a GnRH antagonist. 
Therefore, the use of Elonva is not recommended in combination with a GnRH agonist (see also 
section 4.2). 
Not recommended in adolescent males previously treated with GnRH, gonadotropins, or testosterone 
treatment. 
There are no data available in patients previously treated with GnRH, gonadotropins (e.g., hCG, FSH) 
and androgens (e.g., testosterone, etc.) except for diagnostic testing purposes. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement. Clinical signs and 
symptoms of mild and moderate OHSS are abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, mild to moderate 
enlargement of ovaries and ovarian cysts. Severe OHSS may be life-threatening. Clinical signs and 
symptoms of severe OHSS are large ovarian cysts, acute abdominal pain, ascites, pleural effusion, 
hydrothorax, dyspnoea, oliguria, haematological abnormalities and weight gain. In rare instances, 
venous or arterial thromboembolism may occur in association with OHSS. Transient liver function test 
abnormalities suggestive of hepatic dysfunction with or without morphologic changes on liver biopsy 
have also been reported in association with OHSS. 
OHSS may be caused by administration of hCG and by pregnancy (endogenous hCG). Early OHSS 
usually occurs within 10 days after hCG administration and may be associated with an excessive 
ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation. Late OHSS occurs more than 10 days after hCG 
administration, as a consequence of the hormonal changes with pregnancy. Because of the risk of 
developing OHSS, patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after hCG administration. 
Women with known risk factors for a high ovarian response may be especially prone to the 
development of OHSS following treatment with Elonva. For women having their first cycle of ovarian 
stimulation, for whom risk factors are only partially known, close observation for early signs and 
symptoms of OHSS is recommended. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Follow current clinical practise for reducing the risk of OHSS during Assisted Reproductive 
Technology (ART). Adherence to the recommended Elonva dose and treatment regimen and careful 
monitoring of ovarian response is important to reduce the risk of OHSS. To monitor the risk of OHSS, 
ultrasonographic assessments of follicular development should be performed prior to treatment and at 
regular intervals during treatment; the concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may also be 
useful. In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with 18 or more follicles of 11 mm or more in 
diameter. If OHSS develops, standard and appropriate management of OHSS should be implemented 
and followed. 
Ovarian torsion 
Ovarian torsion has been reported after treatment with gonadotropins, including Elonva. Ovarian 
torsion may be related to other conditions, such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, 
past history of ovarian torsion, and previous or current ovarian cysts. Damage to the ovary due to 
reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion. 
Multiple pregnancy 
Multiple pregnancies and births have been reported for all gonadotropin treatments, including Elonva. 
The woman and her partner should be advised of the potential risks for the mother (pregnancy and 
delivery complications) and the neonate (low birth weight) before starting treatment. In women 
undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is mainly related to the number of 
embryos transferred. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Infertile women undergoing ART have an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancies. It is important 
to have early ultrasound confirmation that a pregnancy is intrauterine, and to exclude the possibility of 
extrauterine pregnancy. 
Congenital malformations 
The incidence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g., maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and the higher incidence of multiple pregnancies.  
Ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is 
not established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in 
infertile women. 
Vascular complications 
Thromboembolic events, both in association with and separate from OHSS, have been reported 
following treatment with gonadotropins, including Elonva. Intravascular thrombosis, which may 
originate in venous or arterial vessels, can result in reduced blood flow to vital organs or the 
extremities. In women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as a 
personal or family history, severe obesity or thrombophilia, treatment with gonadotropins may further 
increase this risk. In these women the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed 
against the risks. It should be noted, however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of 
thrombosis. 
Paediatric population 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are 
unresponsive to Elonva/hCG therapy. 
After completion of pubertal transition with combined Elonva and hCG treatment, long-term treatment 
with testosterone is required in HH patients to maintain secondary sexual characteristics. However, 
follow-up treatment protocols for hormonal support have not been evaluated. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies with Elonva and other medicines have been performed. Since corifollitropin alfa 
is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 enzymes, no metabolic interactions with other medicinal 
products are anticipated. 
Elonva may cause a false positive hCG pregnancy test if the test is administered during the ovarian 
stimulation portion of the ART cycle. This may be due to cross-reactivity of hCG pregnancy tests with 
the carboxy-terminal peptide of the beta subunit of Elonva. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
In case of inadvertent exposure to Elonva during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude 
an adverse outcome of pregnancy. In animal studies reproductive toxicity has been observed (see 
section 5.3). The use of Elonva during pregnancy is not indicated. 
Breast-feeding 
The use of Elonva during breast-feeding is not indicated. 
Fertility 
Elonva is indicated for use in infertility in women: 
In women Elonva is used in the treatment of Controlled Ovarian Stimulation in combination with 
GnRH in ART programs (see section 4.1).  
Elonva is indicated for treatment of HH in adolescent males: 
In adolescent males (14 years and older), Elonva is used in treatment of hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism in combination with hCG (see section 4.1). However, whether this treatment has effect 
on fertility is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
Elonva may cause dizziness. Patients should be advised that if they feel dizzy, they should not drive or 
use machines.

More than one injection of Elonva within one treatment cycle or too high a dose of Elonva and/or 
(rec)FSH may increase the risk of OHSS (see OHSS in section 4.4).  
Paediatric population 
The effects of an overdose of Elonva in the adolescent male population are unknown.  
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins, 
ATC code: G03GA09 
Mechanism of action 
Corifollitropin alfa is designed as a sustained follicle stimulant with the same pharmacodynamic 
profile as (rec)FSH, but with a markedly prolonged duration of FSH activity. The long duration of 
FSH activity was achieved by adding the carboxy-terminal peptide of the β-subunit of human 
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to the β-chain of human FSH. Corifollitropin alfa does not display any 
intrinsic LH/hCG activity.  
In females 
Due to corifollitropin alfa’s ability to initiate and sustain multiple follicular growth for an entire week, 
a single subcutaneous injection of the recommended dose of Elonva may replace the first seven 
injections of any daily (rec)FSH preparation in a COS treatment cycle.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric adolescent male population (14 years and older) 
Corifollitropin alfa’s sustained FSH activity stimulates the immature Sertoli cells in the testis to 
initiate gonadal development in support of future spermatogenesis. The combination of FSH with hCG 
is to initiate puberty with stimulation of Leydig cell function and increase testosterone production until 
testicular volumes attain adult size. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In three randomised, double-blind, clinical trials, treatment with a single subcutaneous injection of 
Elonva, 100 micrograms (ENSURE study) or 150 micrograms (ENGAGE and PURSUE study), for 
the first seven days of COS was compared to treatment with a daily dose of 150, 200, or 300 IU of 
recFSH, respectively. Pituitary suppression with a GnRH antagonist (ganirelix acetate injection at a 
daily dose of 0.25 mg) was used in each of the three clinical trials. 
In the ENSURE study, 396 healthy normal ovulatory women, aged 18 to 36 years with a body weight 
less than or equal to 60 kg, were treated for one cycle with 100 micrograms of Elonva and pituitary 
suppression with a GnRH antagonist as part of an ART program. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
number of oocytes retrieved. The median total duration of stimulation was 9 days for both groups, 
indicating that two days of recFSH were required to complete ovarian stimulation from stimulation 
day 8 onwards (recFSH was given on the day of hCG for this study). 
In the ENGAGE Study, 1,506 healthy normal ovulatory women, aged 18 to 36 years with a body 
weight greater than 60 kg and less than or equal to 90 kg, were treated for one cycle with 
150 micrograms of Elonva and pituitary suppression with a GnRH antagonist as part of an ART 
program. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were ongoing pregnancy rate and number of oocytes 
retrieved. The median total duration of stimulation was 9 days for both groups, indicating that two 
days of recFSH were required to complete ovarian stimulation from stimulation day 8 onwards 
(recFSH was given on the day of hCG for this study). 
In the PURSUE study, 1,390 healthy normal ovulatory women, aged 35 to 42 years with a body 
weight greater than or equal to 50 kg, were treated for one cycle with 150 micrograms of Elonva and 
pituitary suppression with a GnRH antagonist as part of an ART program. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was vital pregnancy rate. The number of oocytes retrieved was a key secondary efficacy 
endpoint. The median total duration of stimulation was 9 days for both groups, indicating that one day 
of recFSH was required to complete ovarian stimulation from stimulation day 8 onwards (no recFSH 
was given on the day of hCG for this study). 
Number of oocytes retrieved 
In all three studies, treatment with a single injection of Elonva, 100 or 150 micrograms, for the first 
seven days of COS, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved compared with a daily dose of 
recFSH. However, the differences were within the predefined equivalence (ENGAGE and ENSURE) 
or non-inferiority (PURSUE) margins. See Table 1 below.

Pregnancy from the fresh cycles of ENGAGE and PURSUE 
In the ENGAGE study, non-inferiority was demonstrated in ongoing pregnancy rates between Elonva 
and recFSH, with ongoing pregnancy rate defined as presence of at least one foetus with heart activity 
assessed at least 10 weeks after embryo transfer. 
In the PURSUE study, non-inferiority was demonstrated in vital pregnancy rate between Elonva and 
recFSH, with vital pregnancy rate defined as the percentage of subjects with at least one foetus with 
heart activity assessed 5 to 6 weeks after embryo transfer.

Pregnancy from the Frozen-Thawed Embryo Transfer (FTET) cycles of ENGAGE and PURSUE 
The follow-up FTET trial for ENGAGE included women who had at least one embryo thawed for use 
up to at least one year after cryopreservation. The mean number of embryos transferred in the FTET 
cycles of ENGAGE was 1.7 in both treatment groups. 
The follow-up FTET trial for PURSUE included women who had at least one embryo thawed for use 
within two years of the date of the last cryopreservation for this trial. The mean number of embryos 
transferred in the FTET cycles of PURSUE was 2.4 in both treatment groups. This trial also provided 
safety data on the infants born from cryopreserved embryos.  
The maximum number of FTET cycles was 5 and 4 for the follow-up FTET trial for ENGAGE and 
PURSUE, respectively. The pregnancy results from the first two FTET cycles of ENGAGE and 
PURSUE are summarised in Table 3 below.

Congenital malformations reported in infants born after a frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FTET) 
cycle 
Following use of Elonva, 61 infants were born after an FTET cycle in the PURSUE study follow-up, 
and 607 infants were born after fresh ART cycles in the ENSURE, ENGAGE and PURSUE studies 
combined. The rates for congenital malformations (major and minor combined) reported for infants 
born after an FTET cycle in the PURSUE study follow-up (16.4%) were similar to those reported for 
infants born after fresh ART cycles in the ENSURE, ENGAGE and PURSUE studies combined 
(16.8%). 
Immunogenicity 
Of the 2,511 women treated with Elonva who were evaluated for the formation of post-treatment 
antibodies, four (0.16%) had evidence of antibody formation, including three who had been exposed 
once to Elonva and one who had been exposed twice to Elonva. In each case, these antibodies were 
non-neutralizing and did not interfere with the response to stimulation or the normal physiologic 
responses of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian (HPO) axis. Two of these four women became 
pregnant during the same treatment cycle in which antibodies were detected, suggesting that the 
presence of non-neutralizing antibodies after stimulation with Elonva is not clinically relevant.

Paediatric population 
A single-group, open-label efficacy and safety study was conducted to evaluate the treatment with 
Elonva in combination with hCG to induce and/or restore puberty and to induce and/or restore 
spermatogenesis in 17 adolescent males aged 14 years and older for the treatment of hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism. A priming period with Elonva instead of hCG in adolescents with HH was included to 
mimic the gonadotropin pattern of normal puberty, stimulating FSH receptors on Sertoli cells with 
corifollitropin alfa prior to stimulation of LH receptors on Leydig cells with hCG. The study excluded 
males who had previously received GnRH, gonadotropins or testosterone treatment. Elonva was 
administered once every 2 weeks for 64 weeks, alone for the first 12 weeks (priming period), followed 
by 52 weeks in combination with twice weekly doses of hCG (500 to 5000 IU) (combined treatment 
period).  
The primary endpoint for efficacy was shown by increase in testicular volume, measured as the sum of 
volumes of left and right testes by ultrasound. During the overall treatment period, the increase noted 
in testicular volume at Week 64 changed from a geometric mean of 1.4 mL to 12.9 mL, mean fold 
increase of 9.43 (95% CI: 7.44, 11.97). The primary endpoint for safety showed that corifollitropin 
alfa was generally well tolerated with no cases of confirmed anti-corifollitropin alfa antibodies, no 
unexpected values or changes in clinical laboratory data or vitals sign assessments (see also section 
4.8). 
Additional findings at Week 64 included, increased testosterone levels, growth velocity and 
progression of puberty (Tanner III, IV and V) indicated appropriate responses to hCG. Decreasing 
anti-müllerian hormone levels and increases in Inhibin B levels were suggestive of initiation of 
spermatogenesis. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of corifollitropin alfa were evaluated after subcutaneous administration in 
women undergoing a COS treatment cycle. 
Due to the long elimination half-life, after administration of the recommended dose, serum 
concentrations of corifollitropin alfa are sufficient to sustain multiple follicular growth for an entire 
week. This justifies replacement of the first seven injections of daily (rec)FSH with a single 
subcutaneous injection of Elonva in COS for the development of multiple follicles and pregnancy in 
an ART program (see section 4.2). 
Body weight is a determinant of exposure to corifollitropin alfa. Corifollitropin alfa exposure after a 
single subcutaneous injection is 665 hours*ng/mL (AUC, 426-1,037 hours*ng/mL1) and is similar 
after administration of 100 micrograms corifollitropin alfa to women with a body weight less than or 
equal to 60 kilograms and of 150 micrograms corifollitropin alfa to women with a body weight greater 
than 60 kilograms. 
Absorption 
After a single subcutaneous injection of Elonva, the maximum serum concentration of corifollitropin 
alfa is 4.24 ng/mL (2.49-7.21 ng/mL1) and is reached 44 hours (35-57 hours1) postdose. The absolute 
bioavailability is 58% (48-70%1). 
Distribution 
Distribution, metabolism and elimination of corifollitropin alfa are very similar to other 
gonadotropins, such as FSH, hCG and LH. After absorption into the blood, corifollitropin alfa is 
distributed mainly to the ovaries and the kidneys. The steady state volume of distribution is 9.2 L 
1 Predicted range for 90% of subjects. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(6.5-13.1 L1). Exposure to corifollitropin alfa increases proportionally with dose within the range of 
60 micrograms to 240 micrograms. 
Elimination 
Corifollitropin alfa has an elimination half-life of 70 hours (59-82 hours1) and a clearance of 0.13 L/h 
(0.10-0.18 L/h1). Elimination of corifollitropin alfa predominantly occurs via the kidneys, and the rate 
of elimination may be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Hepatic 
metabolism contributes to a minor extent to the elimination of corifollitropin alfa. 
Other special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Although data in hepatically impaired patients are not available, hepatic impairment is unlikely to 
affect the pharmacokinetic profile of corifollitropin alfa. 
Paediatric population 
In a study of adolescent males 14 to less than 18 years of age with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 
(n=17) who were administered 100 micrograms (body weight less than or equal to 60 kg) or 
150 micrograms (body weight greater than 60 kg) of Elonva once every two weeks, mean serum 
trough Elonva concentrations (two weeks postdose) were 591 ng/mL when Elonva was administered 
alone and 600 ng/mL when Elonva was co-administered with hCG (given twice weekly). Elonva 
serum concentrations were comparable in participants receiving 100 micrograms and 150 micrograms 
doses of Elonva. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and 
repeated dose toxicity and safety pharmacology. 
Reproduction toxicology studies in rats and rabbits indicated that corifollitropin alfa does not 
adversely affect fertility. Administration of corifollitropin alfa to rats and rabbits, prior to and directly 
after mating, and during early pregnancy, resulted in embryotoxicity. In rabbits, when administered 
prior to mating, teratogenicity has been observed. Both embryotoxicity and teratogenicity are 
considered a consequence of the superovulatory state of the animal not able to support a number of 
embryos above a physiological ceiling. The relevance of these findings for the clinical use of Elonva is 
limited.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Elonva is and what it is used for 
Elonva contains the active ingredient corifollitropin alfa and belongs to the group of medicines called 
gonadotropic hormones. Gonadotropic hormones play an important role in human fertility and 
reproduction. One of these gonadotropic hormones is Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), which is 
needed in women for the growth and development of follicles (small round sacs in your ovaries that 
contain the eggs) and in adolescent males (14 years and older) for treatment of delayed puberty due to 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), in combination with a medicine called human Chorionic 
Gonadotropin (hCG).  
In women 
Elonva is used to help achieve pregnancy in women having infertility treatment, such as in vitro 
fertilisation (IVF). IVF involves collecting the eggs from the ovary, fertilising them in the laboratory, 
and transferring the embryos into the uterus a few days later. Elonva causes the growth and 
development of several follicles at the same time by a controlled stimulation of the ovaries. 
In adolescent males (14 years and older) 
Elonva is used to bring about the development and function of the testes and induce the development 
of male sexual characteristics in adolescent males with delayed puberty due to HH.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Elonva 
Do not use Elonva if you: 
- 
are allergic (hypersensitive) to corifollitropin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6) 
have cancer of the ovary, breast, uterus, or brain (pituitary gland or hypothalamus) 
have recently had unexpected vaginal bleeding, other than menstrual, without a diagnosed cause 
have ovaries that do not work because of a condition called primary ovarian failure 
have ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries 
have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible 
have fibroid tumours in the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
have risk factor of OHSS (OHSS is a serious medical problem that can happen when the ovaries 
are overly stimulated. See below for further explanation.): 
o 
have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) 
o 
have had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)  
o 
have previously had a treatment cycle of controlled stimulation of the ovaries that 
resulted in the growth of more than 30 follicles with a size of 11 mm or larger 
have a basal antral follicle count (the number of small follicles present in your ovaries at 
the beginning of a menstrual cycle) higher than 20 
o 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Elonva. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
Treatment with gonadotropic hormones like Elonva may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
(OHSS). This is a serious medical condition where the ovaries are overly stimulated and the growing 
follicles become larger than normal. In rare cases, severe OHSS may be life-threatening. Therefore, 
close supervision by your doctor is very important. To check the effects of treatment, your doctor will 
do ultrasound scans of your ovaries. Your doctor may also check blood hormone levels. (See also 
section 4.) 
OHSS causes fluid to build up suddenly in your stomach and chest areas and can cause blood clots to 
form. Call your doctor right away if you have: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
severe abdominal swelling and pain in the stomach area (abdomen) 
feeling sick (nausea) 
vomiting 
sudden weight gain due to fluid build up 
diarrhoea 
decreased urine output 
trouble breathing 
You may use Elonva only once during the same treatment cycle, otherwise, the chance of having 
OHSS may increase. 
Before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you have ever had ovarian hyperstimulation 
syndrome (OHSS). 
Ovarian torsion 
Ovarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary. Twisting of the ovary could cause the blood flow to the 
ovary to be cut off.  
Before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
have ever had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). 
are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant.  
have ever had stomach (abdominal) surgery. 
have ever had a twisting of an ovary. 
have past or current cysts in your ovary or ovaries. 
Blood clot (Thrombosis) 
Treatment with gonadotropic hormones like Elonva may (just as pregnancy) increase the risk of 
having a blood clot (thrombosis). Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel. 
Blood clots can cause serious medical conditions, such as: 
- 
blockage in your lungs (pulmonary embolus) 
- 
stroke 
- 
heart attack  
- 
blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis) 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
a lack of blood flow (deep venous thrombosis) that may result in a loss of your arm or leg. 
Please discuss this with your doctor, before starting treatment, especially if: 
- 
- 
- 
you know you already have an increased chance of having a thrombosis 
you, or anyone in your immediate family, have ever had a thrombosis 
you are severely overweight. 
Multiple births or birth defects 
There is an increased chance of having twins or even more than two babies, even when only one 
embryo is transferred into the uterus. Multiple pregnancies carry an increased health risk for both the 
mother and her babies. Multiple pregnancies and specific characteristics of couples with fertility 
problems (e.g., a woman’s age, certain sperm problems, genetic background of both parents) may also 
be associated with an increased chance of birth defects. 
Pregnancy complications 
If treatment with Elonva results in pregnancy, there is a higher chance of pregnancy outside the uterus 
(an ectopic pregnancy). Therefore, your doctor should perform an early ultrasound examination to 
exclude the possibility of pregnancy outside the uterus. 
Ovarian and other reproductive system tumours 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who have had 
infertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increases the risk of these 
tumours in infertile women. 
Other medical conditions 
In addition, before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
have kidney disease.

Other medicines and Elonva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
If you do a pregnancy test during your infertility treatment with Elonva, the test might wrongly 
suggest that you are pregnant. Your doctor will advise you at what time you can start performing 
pregnancy tests. In case of a positive pregnancy test, contact your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not use Elonva if you are already pregnant, or think that you might be pregnant, or if you 
are breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Elonva may cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy, you should not drive or use machines. 
Elonva contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3. 
How to use Elonva 
Always use Elonva exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you 
are not sure. 
In women 
Elonva is used in women having infertility treatment like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). During this 
treatment, Elonva is used in combination with a medicine (so called GnRH-antagonist) to prevent your 
ovary from releasing an egg too early. Treatment with the GnRH-antagonist usually starts 5 to 6 days 
after the injection of Elonva. 
The use of Elonva in combination with a GnRH agonist (another medicine to prevent your ovary from 
releasing an egg too early) is not recommended. 
In adolescent males (14 years and older) 
Elonva in combination with a medicine called hCG, is used for treatment of delayed puberty due to 
HH. Elonva should be administered once every two weeks, in the morning on the same day of the 
week. 
Dose 
Women 
In the treatment of women of reproductive age, the dose of Elonva is based on weight and age. 
- 
- 
A single 100-microgram dose is recommended in women who weigh less than or equal to 
60 kilograms and who are 36 years of age or younger. 
A single 150-microgram dose is recommended in women: 
- 
- 
who weigh more than 60 kilograms, regardless of age. 
who weigh 50 kilograms or more and who are older than 36 years of age. 
Women older than 36 years of age who weighed less than 50 kilograms were not studied.

During the first seven days after the injection with Elonva, you should not use (recombinant) Follicle 
Stimulating Hormone ((rec)FSH). Seven days after the injection of Elonva, your doctor may decide to 
continue your stimulation cycle with another gonadotropic hormone, like (rec)FSH. This may be 
continued for a few days until enough follicles of adequate size are present. This can be checked by 
ultrasound examination. Treatment with (rec)FSH is then stopped and the eggs are matured by giving 
hCG (human Chorionic Gonadotropin). The eggs are collected from the ovary 34-36 hours later. 
In adolescent males (14 years and older) 
The dose of Elonva is based on body weight: 
For adolescent males weighing less than or equal to 60 kg 
- 
100 micrograms of Elonva once every two weeks for 12 weeks, followed by administration of 
Elonva (once every 2 weeks) with hCG. If your body weight increases to greater than 60 kg 
during treatment, your doctor may increase your dose of Elonva to 150 micrograms. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For adolescent males weighing more than 60 kg 
- 
150 micrograms of Elonva once every two weeks for 12 weeks, followed by administration of 
Elonva (once every 2 weeks) with hCG. 
The combination therapy with hCG twice weekly (500 – 5000 IU) may be necessary for 52 weeks or 
longer to achieve adult gonadal development. 
How Elonva is given 
Treatment with Elonva should be supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility 
problems. Elonva must be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) into a skin fold (that you pinch 
between your thumb and index finger), preferably just below the navel. The injection may be given by 
a healthcare professional (for example a nurse), your partner or yourself, if carefully instructed by 
your doctor. Always use Elonva exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure. A step-by-step “instructions for use” is given at the end of this 
leaflet. 
Do not inject Elonva into a muscle.  
Elonva is supplied in pre-filled syringes that have an automatic safety system to help prevent needle 
stick injuries after use. 
If you use more Elonva or (rec)FSH than you should 
If you think you have used more Elonva or (rec)FSH than you should, contact your doctor 
immediately. 
If you forget to use Elonva 
If you forgot to inject Elonva on the day you should have, contact your doctor immediately. Do not 
inject Elonva without talking with your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects 
A possible complication of treatment with gonadotropic hormones like Elonva is unwanted 
overstimulation of the ovaries. The chance of having this complication can be reduced by carefully 
monitoring the number of maturing follicles. Your doctor will do ultrasound scans of your ovaries to 
carefully monitor the number of maturing follicles. Your doctor may also check blood hormone levels. 
The first symptoms of ovarian overstimulation may be noticed as pain in the stomach (abdomen), 
feeling sick or diarrhoea. Ovarian overstimulation may develop into a medical condition called ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can be a serious medical problem. In more severe cases 
this may lead to enlargement of the ovaries, collection of fluid in the abdomen and/or chest (which 
may cause sudden weight gain due to fluid buildup) or clots in the blood vessels. 
Contact your doctor without delay if you have pain in the stomach (abdomen) or any of the other 
symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation, even if they occur some days after the injection has been 
given. 
The chance of having a side effect is described by the following categories:

Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity reactions, both local and generalised, including rash).  
Pregnancy outside the uterus (an ectopic pregnancy) and multiple pregnancies have also been reported. 
These side effects are not considered to be related to the use of Elonva, but to Assisted Reproductive 
Technology (ART) or subsequent pregnancy. 
In rare instances, blood clots (thrombosis) that formed inside a blood vessel, broke off, and travelled 
inside the bloodstream to block another blood vessel (thromboembolism) have been associated with 
Elonva therapy as with other gonadotropins.

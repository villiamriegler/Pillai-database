enrollment into the study. 
1. Evidence of a personally signed and dated ICD indicating that the subject or the subject’s 
parent/legal guardian had been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study. If a subject or the 
subject’s parent/legal guardian was illiterate, he/she must have made his/her mark (eg, thumbprint) 
on the ICD and it must have been signed and dated by an impartial witness who was present 
throughout the entire informed consent process. If consent was provided by a subject’s parent/legal 
guardian, the subject’s assent may also have been required depending on local requirements. 
2. Male or female children 6 to 17 years of age at the time of enrollment. 
3. Healthy subjects, including subjects with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease 12 weeks before receipt of 
13vPnC, were eligible. 
4. Subjects or the subjects’ parent(s)/legal guardian(s) who were willing and able to comply with 
scheduled visits and other study procedures. 
5. Subjects or subjects’ parent(s)/legal guardian(s) were expected to be available for the duration of 
the study. 
6. Male and female subjects of childbearing potential and at risk for pregnancy must have agreed to 
use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study. 
Female subjects who were not of childbearing potential (ie, met at least 1 of the following criteria):

those site staff members or subjects who were Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the 
trial. 
2. History of severe adverse reaction, including hypersensitivity such as anaphylaxis, associated with a 
vaccine or vaccine component. 
3. Any severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may 
have increased the risk associated with study participation or 13vPnC administration or may have 
interfered with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would have 
made the subject inappropriate for entry into this study. 
4. Immunocompromised persons with known or suspected immunodeficiency or who received 
treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, including cytotoxic agents or systemic corticosteroids, eg, 
for cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or autoimmune disease. 
5. Severe chronic disorder, including metastatic malignancy, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease requiring supplemental oxygen, end-stage renal disease with or without dialysis, clinically 
unstable cardiac disease, or any other disorder which, in the investigator’s opinion, precluded the 
subject from participating in the study. 
6. Documented Streptococcus pneumoniae infection within the past 5 years before 13vPnC 
administration. 
7. Receipt of any plasma products or immunoglobulins within 60 days preceding 13vPnC administration 
or anticipated receipt before study completion. 
8. Vaccination with any licensed or investigational pneumococcal vaccine within the last year. 
9. Participation in other studies within 28 days before the current study began and/or during study 
participation. Participation in observational studies was permitted. 
10. Permanent residence in a nursing home, or other residential care facility. An ambulatory subject 
who was a resident of a retirement home or village was eligible for the study. 
11. Pregnant females; breastfeeding females; males and females of childbearing potential and at risk 
for pregnancy who were unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as 
outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study. 
Treatments 
All pediatric subjects received a single dose (0.5 mL) of 13vPnC intramuscularly into the thigh or the 
deltoid muscle as appropriate for the subject, at Visit 1. 13vPnC was provided as a 0.5-mL dose in a 
prefilled syringe. Commercial 13vPnC was provided by the sponsor to each study site. The vaccine was 
labeled in accordance with local regulations.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity Evaluations: One (1) blood sample of approximately 10 mL of blood was collected 
immediately before vaccination at Visit 1 and another blood sample (10 mL) was collected 1 month 
after vaccination at Visit 2 from 200 pediatric subjects for the assessment of immune responses.

The protocol-specified window for blood draw of 28 to 42 days after Visit 1 was expanded in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) by 1 extra day before and 14 days after (ie, the window for blood draw 
was 27 to 56 days after vaccination). 
Antibody-mediated opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes 
(1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) was measured using a serotype-specific 
microcolony opsonophagocytic activity (mcOPA) assay. Results were expressed as geometric mean 
titers (GMTs) for each serotype. An OPA titer was defined as the interpolated reciprocal serum dilution 
that would result in complement-mediated killing of 50% of the bacteria in each mcOPA assay. The 
lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) in titers for each serotype was set as follows: serotype 1, 18; 
serotype 3, 12; serotype 4, 21; serotype 5, 29; serotype 6A, 37; serotype 6B, 43; serotype 7F, 113; 
serotype 9V, 141 serotype 14, 35; serotype 18C, 31; serotype 19A, 18; serotype 19F, 48; and 
serotype 23F, 13. 
Recent communications with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research [CBER]) concerning the OPAs for pneumococcal serotypes 7F and 9V have 
included an adjusted analysis for assay linearity, and resulted in revision of the LLOQs for these 2 
assays. The revised LLOQ for serotype 7F was a titer equal to 113 (previously 210), and the revised 
LLOQ for serotype 9V was a titer equal to 141 (previously 345). OPA titers above the LLOQ were 
considered accurate and their quantitated values will be reported. Titers below the LLOQ or denoted 
below limit of quantitation (BLQ) were set to 0.5 × LLOQ for analysis. 
Safety Evaluations: A medical history was collected and a physical examination was performed on all 
pediatric subjects at Visit 1. Significant medical history and observations from the physical examination 
were to be documented in the case report form (CRF).  
AEs (serious and nonserious) were reported and recorded on the CRF from the signing of the ICD to 
Visit 2 (28 to 42 days after Visit 1). Acute reactions within the first 20 minutes after study vaccine 
administration were assessed and documented on the AE CRF. For serious adverse events (SAEs), the 
active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative began from the time that the subject 
provided informed consent, which was obtained prior to the subject’s participation in the study, ie, 
prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product and continued 
through 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product. SAEs that 
occurred to a subject after the active reporting period ended were reported to the sponsor if the 
investigator became aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believed had at least 
a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product were reported to the sponsor. 
Statistical Methods 
For the immunogenicity analyses, 2 analysis populations were defined for the pediatric cohort: the 
evaluable immunogenicity population and the all-available immunogenicity population. The evaluable 
immunogenicity population was considered the primary analysis population. 
The immunogenicity endpoints for the pediatric cohort were as follows: 
 Serotype-specific OPA antibody titers at both visits (immediately before and approximately 1 month 
after vaccination). 
 Serotype-specific fold rises in antibody titers from immediately before to approximately 1 month 
after vaccination.

 The proportion of subjects achieving serotype-specific OPA titers ≥LLOQ approximately 1 month 
after vaccination. 
 Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) presented graphically for each serotype. 
Immunogenicity analysis summaries were produced for the evaluable immunogenicity population and 
the all-available immunogenicity population. 
Serotype-specific OPA titers were logarithmically transformed for analysis. For each serotype, GMTs at 
both visits (prevaccination and 1 month postvaccination) were calculated. 
Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed by back transformation of the CIs for the 
mean of the logarithmically transformed assay results computed using the Student t distribution. The 
serotype-specific fold rises in antibody titers from prevaccination to 1 month postvaccination were 
summarized by geometric means and corresponding 95% CIs for each serotype. The proportion of 
subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥LLOQ 
1 month after vaccination along with 2-sided 95% CIs for each of the 13 serotypes contained in 
13vPnC was calculated.  
The safety endpoint for the pediatric cohort was the proportion of subjects reporting AEs and SAEs 
within approximately 1 month after 13vPnC administration. AEs were to be categorized according to 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 18.1). The relationship between AEs 
and study vaccine was to be characterized as related or not related as described in the protocol. The 
severity of AEs was to be characterized as mild, moderate, severe, and life threatening. 
The AEs were to be summarized by the total subjects in the safety population in the pediatric cohort. 
In addition, tables for related events, and events characterized as severe were to be tabulated for 
those events occurring during the study. The AEs collected from the signing of the ICD to the postdose 
follow-up were to be listed. 
SAEs were to be summarized for subjects in the safety population. In addition, a listing of SAEs was 
generated from the Global Clinical Database (GCD). 
All summaries were to display the number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1 event for 
each preferred term, arranged by system organ class, and the number of occurrences of the event. 
The proportion of subjects reporting AEs and SAEs within approximately 1 month after 13vPnC 
administration was to be calculated and summarized in the tables. 
There was no formal hypothesis testing for the AE data. 
CHMP comment: The methodology used in this study is in agreement with previous studies, and raise 
no questions.

Safety results 
In this population of 200 pediatric subjects aged 6 to 17 years, no subject had an abnormal physical 
examination or any relevant medical history before vaccine administration. In this study, there were no 
AEs, SAEs, or deaths reported; there were no other significant AEs reported and no subject was 
withdrawn from the study due to an AE. 
The MAH is requested to comment on the lack of AEs and to provide AE frequency in similar age 
populations in other trials with similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.  The AE definition is consistent with 
ICH-GCPs.  However, the definition and study procedures may not have been applied as it should. The 
MAH is requested to indicate how compliance with ICH-GCPs was ensured during the study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The immune responses in terms of OPA titres were significantly higher after vaccination compared to 
before vaccination. The results do not cause concern regarding immunogenicity. The safety results 
indicate that safety follow-up practices differ from previously conducted studies, as no adverse events 
were reported at all, which is unexpected, and raise concern regarding the conduct of the study.

Response 
In Study B1851140, the safety of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) was assessed 
in 200 healthy subjects 6 to 17 years of age in India.  Subjects received one dose of 13vPnC (Visit 1) 
and were followed up for adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) for approximately 
one month (until Visit 2).  As detailed in the clinical study report (CSR), no AEs were reported in the 6 
to 17 year-old cohort.  There were no deaths or SAEs reported in this cohort; and no subject in this 
cohort was withdrawn from the study due to an AE.   
Adverse events and serious adverse events were clearly defined in the protocol (Protocol Section 8, 
Adverse Event Reporting).  In accordance with EU Clinical Trial Directive EU ENTR/CT3 (June 2011) 
and US FDA IND Final Rule (September 2011), an AE was defined in the protocol in Section 8.3 as “any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a product or medical 
device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage.”  
Examples of AEs, as defined in the protocol, included but were not limited to clinically significant 
symptoms and signs; changes in physical examination findings; and abnormal test findings.  An SAE 
was defined as an untoward medical occurrence that was fatal or life-threatening, resulted in persistent 
or significant disability/incapacity, or required hospitalization.  Other important medical events could 
be reported as SAEs according to the judgment of the investigator. 
The protocol safety endpoint was “Incidence of AEs collected by the investigator after clinical 
evaluation and in response to nonspecific questions on the subject’s health.”  Safety reporting 
requirements to meet this endpoint were clearly defined in the protocol.  Medical history was collected 
and a physical examination was performed by the investigator on all subjects at Visit 1 to establish a 
baseline (Protocol Section: 7.5. Safety Parameters).  Subjects were to be observed for at least 20 
minutes after 13vPnC administration for any acute reaction and any observations were to be 
documented as AEs on the case report form (Protocol Section: 6.1, Visit 1).  Visit 2 follow-up was 
conducted 28 to 42 days after vaccination.  At this visit, each subject or parent/legal guardian was 
questioned about AEs in a nonspecific manner, and the investigators were to collect and record 
information on all AEs and SAEs occurring since vaccination, regardless of their suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product.  These were to include all AEs directly observed by the 
investigators and all AEs spontaneously reported by the subject or parent/legal guardian.   
Study B1851140 was conducted according to the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline of the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH).  The investigator training for this study included an 
investigators’ meeting and site initiation visits, with specific training on AE reporting that utilized 
standard approaches that have been used for all 13vPnC studies globally.  During the study, due 
diligence was conducted by the site monitors to confirm the investigators’ understanding of the 
protocol and AE reporting requirements.  From the outset, site monitors were actively engaged in 
routine clinical research monitoring activities.  Review of CRFs early on during site monitoring activities 
revealed no AE CRF pages were being completed; such was highlighted by the site monitors to the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/536289/2016

participating investigators and respective site coordinators to assure elicitation of AEs was being 
performed as stated in the B1851140 protocol.  The participating investigators responded that 
elicitation of AEs was occurring per protocol.  Re-training emphasizing AE reporting was performed.  
During the conduct of the study, the study team noted that no AEs were being documented among 
subjects in the pediatric cohort and took a number of actions to ensure full reporting of any AEs.  Site 
monitors performed 100% source data verification.  Their monitoring confirmed that there were no AEs 
documented in the source notes that were not reported in the case report forms.  Above and beyond 
these routine clinical research monitoring activities, the Pfizer Compliance Officer in India contacted the 
investigators by telephone to confirm their understanding of AE reporting requirements.  Some of the 
points of discussion from the telephone conversations with the investigators which helped to clarify the 
absence of AEs included comments by investigators that healthy subjects with no pre-existing diseases 
were being enrolled, and therefore, the lack of any AEs during the short duration of the study 
(approximately 1 month for each subject) was not unexpected.  From these conversations, the Pfizer 
Compliance Officer was reassured that the subjects’ parents/guardians were adequately counselled and 
questioned by the investigators about AEs. 
Study B1851140 also enrolled 1000 adult subjects 50 to 65 years of age; 999 of these subjects 
received 1 dose of 13vPnC at Visit 1.  Although the 12 sites that enrolled adult subjects were different 
from the 3 sites that enrolled pediatric subjects, the protocol, and the methods and procedures used to 
collect safety data, were the same for both of the cohorts and investigators received the same training 
at investigator meetings and site visits.  Using the same methods and procedures, while no AEs were 
reported for subjects in the pediatric cohort, AEs were reported for 7.0% of subjects in the adult 
cohort.   
The assessor has requested that the MAH provide AE frequency data for similar age populations in 
other trials that had similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Study 6096A1-3011, conducted in the United 
States, evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of 13vPnC administered to children and adolescents 
in 4 different age groups.  Data are presented here for 294 subjects aged ≥5 years to <10 years who 
had previously received at least 1 dose of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Group 3) and 298 
adolescents aged ≥10 years to <18 years who had not previously been vaccinated with any 
pneumococcal vaccine (Group 4).  Subjects in these age groups were administered a single dose of 
13vPnC at study entry.  Information regarding AEs was to be collected by the investigator from the 
signing of the informed consent form (ICF) through the visit that was to take place approximately 
1 month (28 to 42 days) after vaccination.  Complete details of the study methods are described in the 
clinical study report for Study 6096A1-3011, Group 3 and Group 4 (eCTD module 5.3.5.1), submitted 
on 30 March 2012 (EMEA/H/C/001104/II/0055) and approved on 17 November 2012. 
The method for collection of AE data in Study 6096A1-3011 was similar to that used in Study 
B1851140, with one important exception.  In Study 6096A1-3011, subjects/parents were to assess 
and record electronic diary (e-diary) symptoms each day for 7 days after vaccination.   
In the majority of studies in the 13vPnC program, subjects (or the subjects’ parents) were required to 
enter information into an e-diary daily in response to prompts asking about the occurrence of local 
reactions at the study vaccine injection site (tenderness, swelling, and redness) as well as systemic 
events (fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, decreased sleep) occurring within a 
specified number of days after vaccination.  By requiring such careful, daily attention to these 
symptoms, the use of an e-diary could potentially have influenced the way in which subjects/parents 
paid attention to other symptoms that might have manifested during the first month after vaccination, 
increasing their vigilance and awareness as to the occurrence of signs and symptoms that might 
otherwise have gone unnoticed.  Similarly, the detailed recording of this information might also have

influenced subjects/parents to report other minor symptoms that they otherwise would have 
considered too insignificant to mention to the investigator.   
At the time the protocol for Study B1851140 was developed and approved for conduct in India, local 
reactions and systemic events had been collected in all previous pediatric studies using these e-diary 
collection methods, and the reactogenicity profile of 13vPnC was well-established and satisfactory for 
all age groups.  Differences in the reactogenicity profile were not expected in this pediatric population 
in India.  Therefore, when the protocol for Study B1851140 was submitted to the Health Authority in 
India, it did not incorporate the use of e-diaries to collect information on local reactions and systemic 
events and differs in this respect from other studies.   
AEs reported within approximately 1 month after vaccination in Study 6096A1-3011 are summarized 
by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term for subjects in Group 3 and Group 4 in 
Table 4 and Table 5, respectively.  The types of AEs reported were largely the types of signs and 
symptoms that occur frequently in children and adolescents in these age groups.  In subjects ≥5 years 
to <10 years of age, the most frequently reported types of AEs were infections (SOC Infections and 
Infestations, 10.2% of subjects); Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (SOC = 4.8%) 
including cough (3.4%) and nasal congestion (1%); Gastrointestinal Disorders (SOC = 3.7%), 
including vomiting (2.7%) and diarrhoea (1.0%); and other common symptoms such as pyrexia 
(2.4%) and headache (1.0%).  Similar conditions were reported in this study for adolescents 
≥10 years to <18 years of age:  Infections and Infestations (10.4%); Respiratory, Thoracic and 
Mediastinal Disorders (SOC = 3.7%) including cough and oropharyngeal pain (1.7% each); and 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (SOC = 3.7%), including vomiting (1.3%) and nausea (1.0%); and other 
common symptoms such as headache (3.4%) and pyrexia (1.0%). 
AEs that were considered related to study vaccine by the investigator were reported for 3 subjects 
(1.0%) in each age group.  The related AE of headache was reported for 2 subjects in Group 3 and 2 
subjects in Group 4, and the related AE of nausea was reported for 1 subject in each age group.  All 
other related AEs were reported by 1 subject each (Table 6). 
Severe AEs were reported for 2 subjects in Group 3 (appendicitis and eye injury), while no severe AEs 
were reported for subjects in Group 4.  No subjects were withdrawn from the study because of AEs.  
One SAE was reported for a subject in Group 3; this was the case of appendicitis, which was reported 
on Day 1 and resolved after 2 days; this SAE was considered not related to study vaccine by the 
investigator.  No SAEs were reported for subjects in Group 4.

In conclusion, the methods used for collection of information regarding AEs occurring within 1 month 
after vaccination in Study B1851140 were very similar to methods used in both pediatric and adult 
studies in the 13vPnC program, globally.  Investigator training was conducted both at the study 
investigator meetings and at site initiation visits using standard global approaches, and during the 
study, site monitors held conversations with investigators and site coordinators to confirm that 
elicitation of AEs was being performed as stated in the B1851140 protocol.  Although the lack of AEs 
among subjects in the pediatric cohort was concerning to the study team, site monitoring and 
investigator interactions confirmed that the investigators were aware of the reporting requirements, 
but had no AEs to report.   
Assessment: The study has been adequately monitored which resulted in several activities. It appears 
that the sponsor has actively investigated the lack of AE reports in the study by contacting study 
investigators, but it is not clear if the safety/reactogencity during the study has been adequately 
recorded and reported. Thus, the lack of AEs does not seem to be due to investigator lack of training 
or compliance to the protocol, but this cannot be entirely excluded. The MAH claims that the same 
methods for collecting safety that was applied in the adult part of the study, was also applied in the 
adolescent part. However, then we would expect at least some AE reporting. The lack of AEs reporting 
could be due to investigator lack of training or reminder because some of the investigators that were 
contacted by the MAH indicated that they did not expect AE to occur, despite very common AE 
(frequency ≥1/10) being described in the SmPC in the adolescent population. 
In the comparison to the paediatric studies in the clinical development program the main difference in 
reporting was that e-diaries were used in previous studies, while e-diaries were not used in the current 
study. The MAH correctly pointed out that at the time of Study B1851140, the reactogenicity profile of 
13vPnC was well-established and satisfactory for all age groups.  It is considered legitimate that the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/536289/2016

MAH did not find it necessary to incorporate the use of e-diaries in this study because differences in 
the reactogenicity profile were not expected in this pediatric population in India. 
The lack of e-diaries in this study is considered a probable but partial explanation for the lack of AEs in 
the study. Indeed, not using e-dairies is not a reliable explanation for the total absence of AE in this 
study, which is not consistent with safety data obtained in US studies or reported in the SmPC.  
Differences in the AE frequency across studies are very large (around 20% in US studies vs. 0% in 
Indian studies and reactogenicity recorded through the diary represents only part of it). Protocol 
compliance issue (underreporting of AE) therefore remains a likely explanation for the findings.   
The previously reported data have already been assessed. 
It can be concluded that the reporting rate in this study is lower than expected, which is probably at 
least partly due to the method of collecting data, i.e. not using e-diaries. 
Adverse events as defined in the protocol (including but not limited to clinically significant symptoms 
and signs) which were to be reported over a very short period of one month, may have been 
underreported in this study in India compared with the US population aged 6 to 17 years. The MAH 
should take actions to make sure that study compliance is ensured for any further study.  Although no 
safety concern is expected due to this lack of compliance, it is considered as unacceptable to 
underreport AE as the overall validity of the data should be preserved (see  ICH HARMONISED 
TRIPARTITE GUIDELINE; THE COMMON TECHNICAL DOCUMENT FOR THE REGISTRATION OF 
PHARMACEUTICALS FOR HUMAN USE EFFICACY – M4E(R1)).  If non-compliance issues are suspected 
again this could trigger a GCP inspection.’

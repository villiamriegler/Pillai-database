1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant  to  Article  16  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  1234/2008,  Swedish  Orphan  Biovitrum  AB 
(publ) submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 18 December 2019 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

studies to the competent authority 
Submission of the final report from study (Sobi.ANAKIN-302) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. 
This is a non-interventional, post-authorisation safety study to evaluate long-term safety of anakinra 
(Kineret) in patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The RMP version 5.1 has also been 
submitted to reflect completion of the study. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Anakinra is a human IL-1 receptor antagonist that blocks the biological activity of cytokine IL-1 (IL-1α 
and IL-1β) by competitively inhibiting its binding to the IL-1 receptor type 1, thereby controlling active 
inflammation. 
Anakinra is approved in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes 
(CAPS) and Still’s disease (including systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SIJA) and adult-onset still’s 
disease (AOSD).  
Within this variation procedure, the MAH submitted the final study results of a non-interventional, 
post-authorisation safety study to evaluate long-term safety of anakinra (Kineret) in patients with 
SJIA. The study was agreed upon with EMA in a previous variation procedure and was listed as a 
category 3 study in the risk management plan (RMP). The submission of the final study report is also 
in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (Paediatric Regulation) which sets out 
the obligation for MAHs to submit any MAH-sponsored studies involving the use of an authorised 
medicinal products in the paediatric population to the competent authority. 
The non-interventional study used data from the Pharmachild JIA registry. Data were collected from 
2004 to 30 September 2018. Patients included in the study were male and female patients diagnosed 
with SJIA according to the Pharmachild JIA registry study criteria and treated with Kineret.  
A total of 306 patients from 15 different countries were included in the study, with the majority of 
patients from Europe (299 patients; 97.7%). Boys and girls were equally represented, which is in 
accordance with the disease characteristics. Median and mean age at time of Kineret treatment was 
8.0 and 8.2 years, respectively with min and max age being 0.8 and 20.3 years, respectively.  
The safety-related variables were as follows: (1) The occurrence of non-serious adverse events (AEs) 
of at least moderate severity and serious adverse events (SAEs), including macrophage activation 
syndrome (MAS) as an event of special interest (ESI), (2) the duration of Kineret treatment in a real-
world setting, (3) the reasons for Kineret treatment discontinuation.  
• 
The occurrence of non-serious AEs of at least moderate severity and SAEs, including MAS as an 
ESI. 
Assessment report  
EMA/297768/2020  
Page 6/55 
 
 
 
 
The most common AE was administration site reaction which is already included in the SmPC with a 
frequency very common. 
A total of 99 patients experienced a total of 201 AEs of at least moderate intensity thus, approximately 
two-thirds (209 patients, 68%) did not report any AEs of at least moderate in intensity. 
A total of 56 SAEs were reported during the study; IR(95% CI):11.0(7.9-15.2). The majority of SAEs 
were reported within the initial 6 months of treatment. Most SAEs were reported within the MeDRA 
term system organ class (SOC) ‘Injury, poisoning and procedural complications’ and were mainly 
reported to be injection and infusion related reactions. Based on the results of this study and study 
Sobi.ANAKIN-301 (reviewed under EMA/H/C/000363/P46/031), the MAH has committed to submit a 
variation to update the section 4.8 description of the ‘injection site reactions’ of the SmPC. The 
updated text will describe that in 12 patients with Still’s disease treated for 12 weeks in the placebo-
controlled study, ISRs occurred in both treatment groups, of which all were mild in severity. 
During the study period, 11 patients (3.6%) experienced 12 episodes (11 SAEs and 1 non-serious AE) 
of MAS on Kineret treatment. The IR of the first occurrence was 2.2 per 100 py. It is well-known that 
patients with Still’s disease have an increased risk of spontaneous development of MAS. It is also well-
known that MAS often develops due to certain triggers including infections and certain medication 
however, a causal relationship between Kineret and MAS has not (yet) been established. The present 
study is not designed to decide on a potential relationship between Kineret and MAS. There was no 
pattern in the timing of MAS in relation to duration of Kineret treatment. Based on the results of this 
study and study Sobi.ANAKIN-301, the MAH has committed to update the product information later 
this year to reflect the incidence rate of MAS.  
• 
The duration of Kineret treatment in a real-world setting. 
Almost half (46%) of the patients were at some point treated with Kineret for at least 12 months and 
approximately one-fourth (28%) were treated for at least 24 months. The majority (n=259; 85%) of 
patients were only treated with one course of Kineret and only very few (n=6; <2%) of the patients 
received ≥3 treatment courses. 
• 
The reasons for Kineret treatment discontinuation. 
The majority (3/4) of the patients discontinued Kineret treatment at some time during the study 
period. At all-time windows, the most common reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy (23.5-
50.0%) with the percentage of patients discontinuing for this reason despite variations, being fairly 
stable over time. The second most common reason for discontinuation of Kineret treatment was 
remission (reported in 18.3-55.9% of the discontinuations). The proportion increased over time (up to 
18 months) indicating that long-term treatment may result in remission of the disease. AEs of at least 
moderate severity was the third most common reason for discontinuations within the first 6 months 
(15.6%). Additionally, mild AEs and intolerance were reported in 3.7% and 7.3% of the 
discontinuations, respectively. Discontinuations due to AEs (any degree) and Intolerance decreased 
over time indicating that at least the most severe/bothersome AEs were most common in the 
beginning of the treatment. Numeric, slightly more patients with concomitant treatment discontinued 
due to AE and/or intolerance; this could be explained by the fact that concomitant treatment increases 
the risk of more adverse events, but the differences are small and neither statistically significant nor 
clinically relevant. 
Despite limitations due to the study design, the present study provides valuable information regarding 
Kineret-treatment of children and adolescents with Still’s disease. The reported safety profile is mostly 
in line with the observations from previous studies (e.g. the pivotal phase III study used for the MAA). 
The MAH has committed to submit a Type II variation application for relevant updates of the 
Assessment report

SmPC based on this study and also for completeness based on study Sobi.ANAKIN-301 (reviewed 
under EMA/H/C/000363/P46/031). 
Overall, no new safety concerns have been identified from the study and the safety profile of Kineret is 
in line with what is already known. The benefit-risk balance of Kineret (anakinra) remains unchanged.

5.  Introduction 
Anakinra (ATC code: L04AC03; trade name: Kineret) is a human IL-1 receptor antagonist that blocks 
the biological activity of cytokine IL-1 (IL-1α and IL-1β) by competitively inhibiting its binding to the 
IL-1 receptor type 1, thereby controlling active inflammation.  
Kineret was first approved in the US in 2001 for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 
subsequently in the EU/EEA for RA and all forms of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS). 
In 2018, Kineret was approved in the EU/EEA in adult and paediatric patients for the treatment of 
Still's disease, including SJIA and AOSD, with active systemic features of moderate to high disease 
activity, or in patients with continued disease activity after treatment with NSAIDs or glucocorticoids. 
Still's disease is an autoinflammatory disorder with few approved treatment options. The pathogenesis 
of Still's disease is not completely understood. Clinical and laboratory observations suggest an 
inappropriate activation of the innate immune system, with hypersecretion of proinflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 as an important mechanism of the disease. The typical clinical features 
of Still's disease include high spiking intermittent fever, maculopapular rash, lymphadenopathy, 
hepatosplenomegaly, serositis, and marked increase in acute-phase reactants. Still's disease is also 
associated with chronic arthritis or arthralgias, as well as complications such as joint damage, growth 
impairment, osteoporosis, amyloidosis, and the potentially fatal MAS 1,2,3,4,5. One of the most severe 
complications in Still's disease is MAS, a type of secondary HLH. In general, the literature suggests 
that 7-17% of all paediatric patients with Still's disease develop full-blown MAS, but the true frequency 
of MAS may be higher since subclinical and mild MAS have been reported to occur in another 30-40% 
of these patients5,6 .  
A non-interventional PASS, using the Pharmachild JIA register via the associated PRINTO network, has 
been performed in collaboration with PRINTO. The study was agreed upon with EMA in Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0056. The PASS was included in Section III.2-3 of the Kineret EU RMP version 
4.5, as a category 3 activity. The EU RMP version 4.5 was approved by EMA following the approval of 
Still's indication in April 2018. In the EU RMP version 4.9, also approved by EMA, the due date for the 
submission of the PASS report had been updated to December 31, 2019. The study has been 
registered in the public EU PAS register and on clinicaltrials.gov, and the collected safety data will be 
reported in PSUR and RMP updates as applicable. 
The primary objective of PASS Sobi.ANAKIN-302 was to evaluate the long-term safety of Kineret in 
paediatric patients with Still's disease in routine clinical care, including MAS. 
CHMP comments 
The MAH has correctly presented the background for anakinra (Kineret), the use of the product within 
the approved indications including Still’s disease. 
The MAH has also correctly identified the safety issues leading the study to be imposed.

6.  Clinical Safety aspects 
Not applicable as the PASS was a Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) (see section 7. ). 
7.  Non-interventional Post-Authorisation Safety Study 
(PASS)  
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
7.1.1.  Study design and setting 
This was an international, non-interventional, single-armed, pharmacovigilance registry study of long-
term safety utilizing already available data from the ENCePP certified Pharmachild JIA registry. 
This study was based on secondary use of data from the Pharmachild JIA registry. Data were extracted 
and analysed for all male and female patients classified as SJIA, as per the ILAR classification criteria7 
8, included in the Pharmachild JIA registry, who were ever treated with Kineret subsequently to SJIA 
diagnosis. 
No treatment assignment or randomization was applicable. 
The Pharmachild JIA registry was set up in December 2011. Both retrospective and prospective data 
has been collected within the registry. The first Kineret treatment, retrospectively collected in the 
registry, occurred in 2004. Data collected in the registry up until 30 September 2018 were used in this 
study. 
CHMP comments 
The  study  was  designed  as  a  non-interventional  pharmacovigilance  registry  study  utilizing  already 
available data from the Pharmachild JIA registry. As such, all methodological weaknesses known to 
be associated with register studies also apply to this study. The Pharmachild JIA registry is a registry 
collecting  data  from  patients  with  JIA  including  patients  with  SJIA.    It  is  endorsed  that  both 
retrospective and prospective data (defined as from December 2011) in included as this provides more 
data; total data-collection time has been 14 years (from 2004 till September 2018).  
7.1.2.  Subjects 
Male and female patients with a diagnosis of SJIA as per the ILAR classification criteria included in the 
Pharmachild JIA registry study and who were ever treated with Kineret subsequently to SJIA diagnosis 
were included in the study. 
CHMP comments 
Patients included in the present study were male and female patients diagnosed with SJIA according 
to the Pharmachild JIA registry study criteria and treated with Kineret. There were no restrictions with 
regard to disease duration or severity other than patients were treated with anakinra, which according 
to  the  labelled  indication  is  indicated  “for  the  treatment  of  Still’s  disease  […]  with  active  systemic 
features  of  moderate  to  high  disease  activity,  or  in  patients  with  continued  disease  activity  after

treatment  with  NSAIDs  or  glucocorticoids.”  This  indicates  that  the  included  patients  were  overall 
severely  affected  of  the  disease.  There  were  also  no  restrictions  with  regard  to  the  patients’ 
demographics or baseline characteristics. This is endorsed as this optimizes the possibility of including 
more patients into the study and also of obtaining ‘real world’ data. 
7.1.3.  Variables 
The endpoints to support the objective for the study were: 
• The occurrence of non-serious AEs of at least moderate severity and SAEs, including MAS as an ESI. 
• The duration of Kineret treatment in a real-world setting. 
• The reasons for Kineret treatment discontinuation. 
The MedDRA dictionary SOC Immune system disorders includes a specific PT called Haemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH, equivalent to macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)), which in the 
literature and in current clinical practice is referred to as Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) when 
occurring in patients with SJIA, as per the recent ACR/EULAR classification criteria5,6 . In this report 
these terms are used as synonymous interchangeably. 
The Pharmachild JIA registry CRF collected variables were used in the endpoint analysis of this study 
as follows: 
• Demographics (date of birth, sex, ethnicity, country). 
• Date of disease onset, i.e. ‘occurrence of the first clinical manifestation consistent with the disease’, 
and date of diagnosis. 
• Start and stop date of Kineret treatment. 
• Start and stop dates of all other SJIA related medications, i.e. sDMARDs or bDMARDs, and systemic 
glucocorticoids. 
• AE SOC/LLT term as per MedDRA dictionary. 
• Start date of non-serious AEs of at least moderate severity. 
• Start date of all SAEs. 
• Report type for AEs: initial or follow-up. 
• Date of death. 
• Specification of trigger event for incident MAS cases: disease flare, infection, changes of treatment 
and other. 
• Reasons for discontinuation of Kineret treatment: adverse event (moderate/severe/serious event or 
mild event), intolerance, dose change, inefficacy, remission, surgery, pregnancy or other reason. 
CHMP comments 
The safety-related variables are according to the data obtained from the Pharmachild JIA registry and 
are as follows: (1) The occurrence of non-serious AEs of at least moderate severity and SAEs, including 
MAS  as  an  ESI,  (2)  The  duration  of  Kineret  treatment  in  a  real-world  setting,  (3)  The  reasons  for 
Kineret treatment discontinuation.  
Overall,  the  safety-related  outcomes  are  considered  to  be  in  accordance  with the objectives  of  the 
study. Due to the study design, it is not possible to include information regarding mild AEs however,

information regarding discontinuation due to AEs (including mild AEs) is collected. Overall, as this is 
a PASS, it is considered acceptable that only data regarding moderate and severe AEs as well as SAEs 
are included. 
Collection of demographics and baseline (including disease baseline) characteristics is endorsed.  
7.1.4.  Data sources and measurement 
PRINTO (www.printo.it) is a non-profit, non-governmental, international research network founded in 
1996. PRINTO initially included 14 European countries (now 88 countries, 640 centers worldwide with 
1,348 members today), with the goal to foster, facilitate and co-ordinate the development, conduct, 
analysis, and reporting of international, multi-center, clinical trials and/or outcome standardization 
studies in children with paediatric rheumatic diseases. 
The Pharmachild JIA registry, which was set up in December 2011 with a 3-year grant from the EU, is 
maintained by PRINTO, and is a registry collecting data from patients with JIA including patients with 
SJIA.  
The data source contained both retrospectively and prospectively collected data. The retrospectively 
collected data were the data collected from the medical records prior to enrolment in the Pharmachild 
JIA registry. The prospectively collected data were data collected after enrolment in the registry. For 
this study retrospectively and prospectively collected data were treated equally. 
This study was based on secondary use of data already available in the Pharmachild registry. The 
source for all data in the registry was the patients’ medical records. In the registry both the 
retrospective and prospective part contained demographics, concomitant medications since onset of 
disease until last available follow up, AEs that were of at least moderate severity and events of special 
interest (e.g. MAS). AEs were coded in MedDRA version 21.1. A medical monitor evaluated all reported 
AEs. This person was able to raise queries to the centers and request further clarifications. 
CHMP comments 
The MAH has sufficiently described the data sources, PRINTO and the Pharmachild registry. Data was 
collected retrospective as well as prospectively and handled equally. This is acceptable. It is informed 
that “A medical monitor evaluated all reported AEs. This person was able to raise queries to the centers 
and  request  further  clarifications.”  The  MAH  has  clarified  that  the  data  remained  blinded  for  the 
medical  monitor.  The  focus  was  to  ensure  the  right  diagnoses  (ILAR)  and  adverse  events.  It  was 
informed that the medical monitor also was the principle investigator of one of the PRINTO sites thus 
theoretical, it cannot be excluded that the medical monitor recognized his/her ‘own’ patients. However, 
a total of 259 patients were included in the study. Overall, this is not expected to affect the study 
results.  
7.1.5.  Bias 
Pharmachild is an observational JIA registry with retrospectively collected and prospectively observed 
data involving potentially all countries and centers connected to PRINTO. 
From a time perspective the data collected in the retrospective components envisioned two steps9 : 
Step 1: A census (e.g. collection of patient identification number, age, JIA type and type of treatment) 
was required from each center before retrospective chart review of safety data initiated to avoid

insights from the juvenile counterpart. Immunol Res. 2015;61(1-2):53-62.

Page 13/55 
 
 
 
 
selection biases (e.g. to have the proper denominator against which evaluating the successful data 
collection). 
Step 2: Retrospective chart revision for the collection of moderate/severe non-serious AEs and SAEs 
until the time of the last available visit. This retrospective chart review was considered successful if at 
least 70% of the patients listed in the census would have been retrieved. 
The study design carries the general limitations inherent in an uncontrolled design regarding statistical 
analyses, interpretation, generalizability and conclusiveness. The IRs for AEs while exposed to Kineret 
may be under- or overestimated because of exposure-related misclassification of patient-time. The 
direction of the bias will depend on the direction of the difference in true incidence in the non-exposed 
(all other treatment options) group vs. Kineret exposed group (e.g. a higher incidence in non-exposed 
vs. exposed will over-estimate the IRs for the Kineret treatment). The non-exposed patient-time will 
likely be a mixture of other SJIA-related medications. Misclassification of exposure is likely during non-
registered short interruptions of Kineret treatment. Nevertheless, by using a validly conducted register 
study with the primary objective to research the adverse effects of JIA related medications and with 
granular recording of exposure time, will alleviate the magnitude of the potential exposure 
misclassification bias. 
The use of sub-populations with patients treated for a certain time may bias the comparisons since the 
studied patients may have been selected because of a relatively low incidence of adverse events before 
selection into the sub-population. The probability of experiencing an adverse event by chance may be 
increased following selection into the sub-population. A comparison with the IR for the respective time 
window in the total population (the complete set) and not only the sub-population specific IR will likely 
alleviate a more unbiased conclusion. 
All patients in the Pharmachild JIA registry with a diagnosis of SJIA (as per ILAR classification criteria) 
who were ever treated with Kineret following the SJIA diagnosis were included in this study. No other 
criteria were used to select patients. In the Pharmachild JIA study a census (e.g. collection of patient 
identification number, age, JIA type and type of treatment) is required from each center before 
retrospective chart review of safety data initiation to avoid selection biases (e.g. to have the proper 
denominator against which evaluating the successful data collection).  
CHMP comments 
The MAH has adequately discussed potential bias in this study. The general risks of bias related to the 
study deign (e.g. the study being non-controlled and depending on the information obtained in the 
registry including the risk of missing data) are relevant to consider. Furthermore, it is agreed that the 
IRs  for  AEs  while  exposed  to  Kineret  may  be  both/either  under-  or  overestimated  if  the  exposure-
related of patient-time is misclassified.  
7.1.6.  Study size 
The sample size was not based on any formal calculation. All 306 patients enrolled in the Pharmachild 
JIA registry study before 30 September 2018 meeting the criteria defined for the study population 
were included in the study. 
CHMP comments 
No formal sample size calculation was made for this study. The MAH informs that all (306) patients 
enrolled in the Pharmachild JIA registry and fulfilling all inclusion criteria were included in the study. 
This  is  endorsed.  Considered  an  annual  incidence  of  1-20  in  900,000  children  and  a  total  data-

collection  time  of  approximately  14  years;  it  seems  reasonable  that  a  total  of  306  patients  were 
included in the Pharmachild JIA registry as per 30 September 2018. 
With a total study population of 306 patients it is expected that very common (≥1/10) and common 
(≥1/100 to <1/10) AEs will be reported however, uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 
to  <1/1,000)  and  very  rare  (<1/10,000)  AEs  will  most  likely  not  be  reported.  This  is  considered  a 
weakness to the study.  
7.1.7.  Data transformation 
In the Pharmachild JIA registry data have been collected on-line via the secured PRINTO website. The 
web system is accessible only to authorized personnel through unique individual usernames and 
passwords. 
Data are cleaned and remotely monitored by designated PRINTO personnel on an ongoing basis to 
check the accuracy of data. If necessary, additional and more precise information can be requested by 
the PRINTO personnel. Technical management of the database is handled by PRINTO. No individual 
patient listings were obtained for this study, only summary outputs were reported. 
The following variables were derived for this study: 
• Time since disease onset was calculated as the difference between ‘start date’ of Kineret treatment 
and ‘Disease onset’. 
• Time from disease onset to first center visit was calculated as the difference between first date 
center visit and ‘Disease onset’. 
• Time since SJIA diagnosis was calculated as the difference between ‘start date’ of Kineret treatment 
and ‘JIA diagnosis date’. 
• Age at start of treatment with Kineret was calculated as the difference between ‘Birth date’ and start 
date of Kineret treatment. 
• Age categories at baseline as follows, Infant (<2 years), Child (2 years - <12 years), Adolescent (12 
years - <8 years), Adult (≥18 years), and Unknown. 
• Ethnicity classification with categories ‘Caucasian, ‘Other’. 
• History of MAS (Yes/No). Derived by identifying any known or recorded episodes of MAS prior to 
baseline. 
Each period of Kineret treatment exposure duration was derived as the duration from the start date of 
Kineret until (and including) the stop date of Kineret plus two (2) days. The two days addition was to 
account for approximately five (5) half-lives of anakinra. The stop date was substituted with the end of 
the time window, date of discontinuation of the Kineret treatment exposure, last visit or death where 
applicable. In case of death or of last visit, the 2 days were not to be added to the duration. 
CHMP comments 
The MAH has adequately and sufficiently described data transformation.

7.1.8.  Statistical methods 
7.1.8.1.  Main summary measures 
Results were presented descriptively with corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval, when 
relevant. Confidence intervals were presented to one more decimal place than the raw data. 
Continuous data were summarized using descriptive statistics: n, mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum and maximum, 1th and 3rd quartiles, unless otherwise indicated. Minimum and 
maximum were presented to the same number of decimal places as the raw data and mean, standard 
deviation and median were presented to one more decimal place than the raw data. 
Categorical data were summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages were suppressed when 
the count is zero, however the category was still displayed. The denominator for all percentages was 
the number of patients within the population of interest, unless otherwise indicated. Percentages were 
presented to one decimal place. 
IR of events (calculated as the number of the incident events and dividing by the sum of patient years 
under risk) was expressed as IR per 100 patient years. The IR was derived by a Poisson regression 
model (with only intercept) and the 95% CI was estimated using the Poisson estimator with a cluster-
robust estimate of variance to control for both overdispersion and intra-cluster correlation. 
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software Version 9.3 or later (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, 
North Carolina, United States). 
7.1.8.2.  Main statistical methods 
There were five main analysis sets: 
• The complete set, including all patients with SJIA in the registry who have received Kineret at least 
once following a diagnosis of SJIA as per investigator judgement and enrolled before the cut-off date 
for the current study (30 September 2018). 
• The long-term treatment set-12, including those patients from the complete set with 12 months or 
more of continuous Kineret treatment*. 
• The long-term treatment set-18, including those patients from the complete set with 18 months or 
more of continuous Kineret treatment*. 
• The long-term treatment set-24, including those patients from the complete set with 24 months or 
more of continuous Kineret treatment*. 
• The MAS-1 set, including patients with SJIA who have been diagnosed a first time with MAS following 
start of Kineret treatment. 
*Continuous treatment was defined as ongoing treatment with no more than 30 consecutive days of 
unexposed duration in between treatment periods. The definition of ‘continuous treatment’ affected the 
selection of patients into the long-term treatment set-12, the long-term treatment set-18 and the 
long-term treatment set-24 as well as the presentation of Kineret treatment exposure and Kineret 
discontinuation. 
For the long-term treatment set-12, 18 and 24 the longest continuous treatment period for each 
patient was considered for inclusion in the sub-population. For the complete set and the MAS-1 set, the 
baseline date for each patient was defined as the date of the first dose of Kineret registered following a 
diagnosis of SJIA as per investigator judgement. For the long-term treatment set-12, 18 and 24, the 
start date of the most extended treatment period with Kineret was considered as index date.

EMA/297768/2020

Calculation of unique IRs of each reported term of non-serious AE, SAE and MAS as an event of special 
interest (ESI) respectively, was performed. A patient was allowed to contribute with multiple events of 
the same AE term. Therefore, the patient-time did not cease with the occurrence of an event. In 
addition, mortality rates of all SAEs leading to death were calculated. 
Number of years with Kineret treatment, i.e. patient time under risk and the IR per 100 patient-years 
were calculated. 
The following rules were applied: 
• AEs occurring outside Kineret treatment exposure, i.e. before, and when Kineret treatment was 
paused or stopped were not counted. 
• The exposure to Kineret treatment was calculated from baseline until the end of the time window, 
date of discontinuation of the Kineret treatment exposure, last visit or death. 
• The periods outside Kineret treatment exposure were excluded from the patient-time. 
The IR was derived by a Poisson regression model (with only intercept) and the 95% CI was estimated 
using the Poisson estimator with a cluster-robust estimate of variance to control for both 
overdispersion and intra-cluster correlation. 
AE specific IRs was presented overall for the complete study period and also by 6-month calendar time 
windows defined with reference to the first dose of Kineret. 
In a sub-population constituting those with more than 12 months of continuous treatment with 
Kineret, IRs of non-serious AEs of at least moderate severity, SAEs and MAS were calculated for the 
time after 12 months and in addition IRs were retrospectively derived for each preceding time window 
(i.e. 1-6, 7-12 months). Similarly, the analysis was also performed for the subgroup of patients that 
had more than 18 months (preceding windows to present: 1-6, 7-12 and 13-18 months) and 24 
months (preceding windows to present: 1-6, 7-12, 13-18 and 19-24 months) of continuous treatment 
with Kineret, respectively. For patients who were included in the long-term treatment sets, only the 
patient’s longest treatment period was of interest for analysis. The analyses enabled descriptive 
comparisons of incidence early in the treatment cycle and incidence resulting from long-term 
treatment in the same patients. 
In the interpretation of the IRs calculated for the sub-populations, i.e. the long-term treatment set-12, 
the long-term treatment set-18 and the long-term treatment set-24, respective IR for the total study 
population (the complete set) has been taken into account. Interruptions of treatment, e.g. treatment 
holidays, were allowed for up to 30 days with respect to the definition of continuous treatment. Neither 
AEs nor patient-time was counted during the interruption. The following summaries of AEs were 
presented: 
• Number of AEs (non-serious AEs of at least moderate intensity and serious AEs) and IRs (95% CI) by 
SOC, PT and time window (the complete set). 
• Number of SAEs and IRs (95% CI) by SOC, PT and time window (the complete set). 
• Number of SAEs leading to death and mortality rates (95% CI), by SOC, PT and time window (the 
complete set). 
• Number of AEs (non-serious AEs of at least moderate intensity and serious AEs) and IRs (95% CI) by 
SOC, PT and time window (the long-term treatment set-12, the long-term treatment set-18 and the 
long-term treatment set-24). 
Assessment report  
EMA/297768/2020  
Page 17/55 
 
 
 
• Number of SAEs and IRs (95% CI) by SOC, PT and time window (the long-term treatment set-12, 
the long-term treatment set-18 and the long-term treatment set-24). 
The incidence proportion for each reported AE term was calculated overall and within time windows. 
The following summaries of incidence proportions of adverse events were presented: 
• Number of patients and incidence proportions of AEs (non-serious AEs of at least moderate intensity 
and all serious AEs) by SOC, PT and time window (the complete set). 
• Number of patients and incidence proportions of SAEs by SOC, PT and time window (the complete 
set). 
The IR of MAS was analysed with respect to 1st occurrence and recurrence respectively. The rationale 
for this was to account for a biological distinction in altered risk following a first event. 
For the analyses, the 1st occurrence of MAS was defined to occur at or after baseline regardless of 
whether the patient had a history of MAS or not. The cumulative probability of a first event of MAS 
over time was estimated for the complete set.  
The number of days from baseline until the first occurrence of MAS was presented for the MAS-1 set. 
The number of MAS events and percentages were presented grouped by simultaneous Kineret 
treatment (Yes/No) and days since first injection with Kineret treatment (1-30 days, 31-180 days, 
181-365 and >365 days). In addition, the time after Kineret was stopped until the first occurrence of 
MAS was summarized for the MAS-1 set. All MAS events occurring after baseline were counted 
regardless of whether patients are under simultaneous Kineret treatment exposure or not. 
Notwithstanding, in reporting it was indicated whether simultaneous Kineret treatment exposure was 
present at the occurrence of the event. 
The duration of Kineret treatment exposure was presented with summary statistics (n, mean, SD, 
median, 1th and 3rd quartiles) overall and by time windows. For this analysis, a patient contributed 
with multiple Kineret treatment exposure periods if had started a new treatment period after a 
“treatment holiday” of more than 30 days. Duration of Kineret treatment exposure was presented with 
total number of patients ever treated in respective time window and number of patients at start of 
interval (patients who were in treatment at the first day of each time window) and numbers of patients 
continuously treated at end of interval (patients who had contributed for 6 months to each time 
window). The total number of patients dosed with Kineret at least once in the study had constituted 
the denominator for the calculation of percentages. 
The reasons for Kineret treatment discontinuation for more than 30 days were summarized with 
number and percentage, for the complete set. A patient could contribute with multiple discontinuations 
if she/he had started a new treatment period after a treatment holiday of more than 30 days. 
Furthermore, multiple reasons could be recorded for one single discontinuation. 
7.1.8.3.  Missing values 
The analysis and presentation were based on available data, i.e. no imputation of missing data was 
performed. There was no incomplete information on dates (date of birth, date of SJIA onset, date of 
SJIA diagnosis, start and stop of Kineret, date of adverse event and date of visit).  
CHMP comments 
The MAH has adequately and sufficiently explained the statistical methods applied.  
The MAH informs that the analyses were based on available data thus, no imputations of missing 
data were made. Considered this is a PASS and the overall design of the study, this is acceptable.

7.1.9.  Quality control 
Collection of data has followed standard clinical practice in treatment of the patients. The source for all 
collected data was the patients’ medical records. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigators in the Pharmachild JIA registry study to ensure completion 
and to review all data entered on the PRINTO website. At all times, the Investigators have the final 
responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all patient data entered.  
The PRINTO web system is provided with validation control and it is not expected to have missing data 
related to mandatory questions. All data entered are reviewed by the PRINTO coordinating center for 
completeness and coherence. If necessary, PRINTO personnel contacts the Investigators to verify 
correctness and consistency of the data and to retrieve missing data if available. In case of 
discrepancies, specific queries are issued and resolved through a query ticket system. A medical 
monitor evaluates all reported AEs. Data can be updated or modified by the Investigator only upon 
request to the PRINTO helpdesk. 
Data are validated on an ongoing basis, and a specific validation process is applied. Pharmachild is a 
still ongoing JIA registry at the time of this report. 
CHMP comments 
The MAH has sufficiently explained the quality assurance. 
7.2.  Results 
7.2.1.  Participants 
As stated in the protocol, 307 patients were preliminary identified for inclusion in the analysis. On 30 
September 2018, the cut-off date for inclusion in the study, a total of 306 patients were identified as 
meeting all inclusion criteria. These were patients with SJIA as per ILAR classification criteria, who had 
received Kineret at least once subsequently to disease onset (complete set). 
Of the 40 countries participating in the Pharmachild JIA registry, 15 countries (37.5%) have reported 
data on Kineret treatment. In total 97.7% of the patients were from Europe, and only 2.3% from Asia. 
Caucasian ethnicity was prevalent (70.6%) (Table 1). 
Kineret has been given as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-inflammatory drugs, 
sDMARDs and bDMARDs as per the local standard of care.  
CHMP comments 
306 patients from 15 different countries are included in the study. The majority of the patients (299 
patients; 97.7%) were from Europe. A total of 13 European countries from all geographical parts of 
Europe (Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western parts) contributed with data. Thus, the results are 
considered to be representative for the European population. 
7.2.2.  Descriptive data 
As shown in Table 1, among the 306 patients from the complete set, female and male patients were 
equally represented, with a median age at baseline (first dose of Kineret) of 8.0 years. The patients 
had their first visit at the treating center after a median time of 0.2 years from onset of the first clinical 
manifestation consistent with the disease. The median time from SJIA diagnosis to start of Kineret 
treatment was 0.3 years. Ten (3.3%) patients had history of MAS at start of Kineret treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/297768/2020

Among the 306 patients, 141 (46.1%) patients were at some point continuously treated with Kineret 
for at least 12 months (set-12), 104 (34.0%) patients for at least 18 months (set-18) and 86 (28.1%) 
patients for at least 24 months (set-24). In the long-term treatment sets there was a numerically 
higher percentage of males than females (57.4%, 56.7%, and 57.0% in the -12, -18, and -24 months 
treatment sets, respectively).

years, respectively. Approximately 2/3 (69%) of the patients were <12 years old. Mean time from 
diagnosis till initiation of Kineret treatment was 2.0 years, thus, mean and median age at diagnosis 
was approximately 6 years, which is in accordance with the known disease characteristics. As only 5 
patients were ≥18 years, this is not considered to impact the results in any clinically relevant degree.  
Mean time since SJIA onset and mean time since SJIA diagnose was 2.0 and 1.7 years, respectively 
indicating a lap of approximately 0.3 years (approximately 3-4 months) between the initial symptoms 
and diagnosis; this is expectable. A mean time of approximately 1.7 years between SJIA diagnosis 
and initiation of treatment with Kineret indicate that a substantial proportion of patients may have 
been  treated  with  other  anti-inflammatory  treatment  prior  to  Kineret;  this  is  according  to  the 
treatment  guidelines  and  the  labelled  indication  for  Kineret  (which  is:  “for  the  treatment  of  Still’s 
disease  […]  with  active  systemic  features  of  moderate  to  high  disease  activity,  or  in  patients  with 
continued disease activity after treatment with NSAIDs or glucocorticoids.”). 
7.2.3.  Outcome data, Main results 
The duration of Kineret treatment is presented in section 7.2.3.1. . Reasons for Kineret discontinuation 
are summarized in section 7.2.3.2. . Concomitant medications are summarized in section 7.2.3.3. .  
7.2.3.1.  Duration of Kineret treatment 
Out of the 306 study patients, 141 (46.1%), 104 (34.0%) and 86 (28.1%) patients were at some point 
continuously treated with Kineret for at least 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively (Table 1). A 
continuous treatment was defined as ongoing treatment with no more than 30 consecutive days of 
unexposed duration in between treatment periods. 
Overall, the 306 patients had a total of 360 courses of Kineret treatment and the mean duration of a 
treatment course with Kineret was 17.0 (standard deviation 21.1) months and the median duration 
was 8.9 (first quartile of 3.1, third quartile of 23.5) months (Table 2). The shortest treatment course 
was 0.2 months, whereas the longest course was 109.9 months. 
Six months after first Kineret dose, a total of 184/306 patients (60.1%) were still continuously 
exposed. Similarly, after 12, 18 and 24 months, there were 134, 97 and 85 patients respectively still 
continuously on Kineret treatment (Table 2). 
In total 30.1% of the patients were censored at the last date of visit (i.e. Kineret treatment was 
ongoing at the last report in the registry).

CHMP comments 
It  is  reassuring  that  almost  half  (46%)  of  the  patients  were  at  some  point  treated  for  at  least  12 
months and approximately one-fourth (28%) were treated for at least 24 months. However, the most 
important is not treatment duration but reasons for discontinuations (see below).  
The majority (n=259; 85%) of patients were only treated with one course of Kineret and only very 
few (n=6; <2%) of the patients received ≥3 treatment courses. 
7.2.3.2.  Reasons for Kineret treatment discontinuation 
Out of the 306 patients, 233 patients (76.1%) discontinued Kineret at least once (Table 3), censored 
patients excluded). In total, there were 268 discontinuations with 281 reasons recorded. The most 
frequent reason for Kineret discontinuation were inefficacy with 121 occurrences out of 281 reasons in 
total (43.1%). Similarly, remission was recorded in 30.6% of all reasons. AEs were represented in 
10.0% of all reasons for discontinuations (AEs of at least moderate intensity 8.2% and AEs of mild 
intensity 1.8%). Intolerance was given as the reason for discontinuation in 5.0% of the cases. 
Discontinuations due to AEs and intolerance were more frequently reported during the first 6 months 
of therapy compared to later time periods. The proportion of discontinuations due to remission 
increased over time up to 18 months.

CHMP comments 
Overall, the majority (3/4) of the patients discontinued Kineret treatment at some time during the 
study period. At all time windows, the most common reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy 
(23.5-50.0%) with the percentage of patients discontinuing for this reason despite variations, being 
fairly stable over time. This indicates that patients who initially benefit from the treatment may not 
continue doing so. After 19 months treatment, approximately half of the patients had discontinued 
due to lack of efficacy. There were no clear differences in baseline characteristics between the group 
Assessment report  
EMA/297768/2020  
Page 23/55 
 
 
 
 
 
of patients discontinuing due to lack of efficacy and the remaining patients thus, no predictive baseline 
characteristics were identified.  
The second most common reason for discontinuation of Kineret treatment was remission (reported in 
18.3-55.9% of the discontinuations). The proportion increased over time (up to 18 months) indicating 
that long-term treatment may result in remission of the disease. This is reassuring. 
Adverse  events  (AEs)  of  at  least  moderate  severity  was  the  third  most  common  reason  for 
discontinuations  within  the  first  6  months  (15.6%).  Additionally,  mild  AEs  and  Intolerance  were 
reported in 3.7% and 7.3% of the discontinuations, respectively. Discontinuations due to AEs (any 
degree) and Intolerance decreased over time indicating that at least the most severe/bothersome AEs 
were  most  common  in  the  beginning  of  the  treatment.  Numeric,  slightly  more  patients  with 
concomitant treatment discontinued due to AE and/or intolerance; this could be explained by the fact 
that concomitant treatment increases the risk of more adverse events, but the differences are small 
and neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant. 
7.2.3.3.   Concomitant medications 
The latest treatment regimen of sDMARDs, bDMARDs and glucocorticoids received at any time from 
disease onset to the first dose of Kineret is presented in Table 4. Out of 306 patients, 94 (30.7%) had 
not been treated with either sDMARDs, bDMARDs or glucocorticoids before starting with Kineret  
(Table 4). The remaining 212 patients (69.3%, derived from Table 4 had received at least one of these 
treatments. Among the 212 patients, 78 (36.8%) were treated with various combinations of sDMARDs, 
bDMARDs and glucocorticoids before starting with Kineret and also continued with those concomitantly 
with Kineret treatment and 134 (63.2%, derived from Table 4) had stopped treatment before they 
started with Kineret. 
A total of 193 (63.1%) patients received at least 1 concomitant SJIA related medication, other than 
NSAIDs, at the start of Kineret treatment. 161/306 (52.6%, derived from table) patients received 
glucocorticoids concomitantly with Kineret at treatment start.

CHMP comments 
A total of 94 (30.7%) of the patients were not treated with any of the listed products prior to Kineret. 
Considered  the  labelled  indication  (“for  the  treatment  of  Still’s  disease  […]  with  active  systemic 
features  of  moderate  to  high  disease  activity,  or  in  patients  with  continued  disease  activity  after 
treatment with NSAIDs or glucocorticoids.”), it is expectable that a proportion of patients has not been 
treated with any other DMARDs prior to initiation of Kineret treatment. Thus, the proportion of patients 
not being treated with any of the listed products prior to Kineret is of an expected magnitude Of these 
94 patients, 49 (52%) patients were enrolled from the Netherlands, 15 (16%) patients were enrolled 
from Spain, 14 (15%) patients from France and 9 (10%) patients were enrolled from Italy. Half (n=51; 
53%) of the 94 patients were enrolled from two centres (one in the Netherlands and one in Spain). 
This may indicate that the choice of treatment is at least to a certain degree according to local (national 
and  centre-specific)  guidelines.  Overall,  the  pattern  is  in  accordance  with  the  development  of 
treatment recommendations of patients with Still’s disease; Historically, most patients were initially 
treated with NSAIDs and glucocorticoids but due to the adverse event profile of long-term treatment 
with glucocorticoids, biologic agents (especially the interleukin (IL) 1 and IL-6 inhibitors) are being 
used  more  often  as  single  therapy  at  disease  onset  because  they  are  effective  in  reducing  clinical 
symptoms in patients with disease and have a different AE profile. 
The most common treatment prior to initiation of Kineret was ‘Glucocorticoids only’, ‘bDMARDs only’ 
and a combination of these. This is in accordance with the treatment guidelines. Twenty (20; 65.4%) 
patients were treated with a triple- or quatro- combination of drugs. 
Totally 78 (36.8%) patients continued initial treatment after initiation of Kineret. The most common 
combination  was  Kineret  +  glucocorticoids.  It  is  well-known  that  treatment  with  high-dose 
glucocorticoids should be gradually reduced, and in accordance with this, the MAH informs that a total 
of  42  (54%)  were  treated  concomitantly  with  both  Kineret  and  glucocorticoid.  However,  of  these 
patients, 31 (74%) were treated with glucocorticoids for ≥2 months indication that for these patients 
the concomitant treatment may have been therapeutic rather than a short overlapping period when 
tapping down the glucocorticoid treatment. 
7.2.4.  Adverse events/adverse reactions 
7.2.4.1.  Adverse events by PT and SOC 
Table 2 in the clinical trial report reports the number of AEs (non-serious AEs of at least moderate 
intensity and serious AEs) with the related IRs and 95% CI by MedDRA SOC and PT, overall and 
according to 5 consecutive time windows for Kineret treatment: 1-6 months, 7-12 months, 13-18 
months, 19-24 months, and >24 months after first injection of Kineret. In Table 3 of the clinical trial 
report, the same data are reported by overall PT by decreasing frequency. 
A total of 201 AEs were identified with an overall IR of 39.5 (95% CI 30.8-50.6) per 100 py. The 
overall incidence of AEs decreased over time with the highest IRs during the first 6 months of Kineret 
treatment. This was confirmed also by the fact that the 95% CI of the IR (IR=98.9, 95% CI (75.8-
129)) during the time window of 1-6 months did not overlap with the 95% CI of any of the following 
time windows. The MedDRA SOC where AEs were most frequently reported was “Infections and 
Infestations” (a total of 52 AEs, IR=10.2 per 100 py), followed by “Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders” (a total of 25 AEs, IR=4.9 per100 py), “General disorders and administration site 
conditions” (a total of 23 AEs, IR=4.5 per 100 py), and “Gastrointestinal disorders” (a total of 18 AEs, 
IR=3.5 per 100 py). 
Assessment report  
EMA/297768/2020  
Page 26/55 
 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported PTs in SOC “Infections and Infestations” were respiratory tract infections, 
constituting 28 out of 52 events (53.8%) (1 ear infection, 2 influenza, 1 lower respiratory tract 
infection, 1 otitis media, 3 otitis media acute, 2 Pharyngitis, 1 Pharyngitis bacterial, 4 Pneumonia, 1 
Pneumonia viral, 4 Respiratory tract infection, 1 Rhinitis, 1 Sinusitis, 1 Tonsillitis, 2 Tonsillitis 
streptococcal, 3 Upper respiratory tract infection). There were also 3 varicella infections, and 1 case of 
herpes zoster. 
The most frequently reported PTs in SOC “Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders” were rash, with 8 
occurrences, and urticaria and eczema with 3 occurrences each.  
The most frequently reported PTs in SOC “General disorders and administration site conditions” were 
events related to the injection site, with 15 occurrences (8 classified as “Injection site reaction”, 2 each 
as “Injection site pain” and “Injection site rash”, and one each for “Injection site hypersensitivity”, 
“Injection site inflammation” and “Injection site urticarial”). Other PTs included fatigue with 3 
occurrences while all other reported PTs occurred only once. 
The most frequently reported PTs in SOC “Gastrointestinal disorders” were constipation with 6 
occurrences and abdominal pain with 4 occurrences. 
The SOC “Immune system disorders” included 12 events of MAS and 1 event of unspecified 
Autoimmune disorder. For further results concerning MAS (MedDRA PT HLH), see the dedicated 
paragraphs later in this section. Of the 9 AEs reported in the SOC “Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders”, there were 4 AEs of neutropenia and 2 AEs of lymphadenopathy.  
When analyzing the AEs by overall PT by decreasing frequency of occurrence, those which had at least 
5 occurrences (and IR greater than 1) included, MAS, n=12, was the most reported event with an IR of 
2.4 per 100 py. The most frequently reported PTs thereafter were injection-related reactions with an 
IR of 2.0 per 100 py, injection site reactions with an IR of 1.6 per 100 py, rash, 1.6 per 100 py, and 
constipation, 1.2 per 100 py. The remaining AEs showed an IR below 1 per 100 py. 
The majority of the “injection site reactions” (ISRs) occurred early after start of Kineret. The 3 infusion 
related reactions reported were related to a concomitantly administered drug (tocilizumab).  
CHMP comments 
Among the 306 patients included in the study, a total of 201 AEs were identified. The overall IR was 
39.5 (95% CI 30.8-50.6) per 100 py. For all SOCs, the majority of AEs were reported within the first 
6 months of treatment (confirmed by 95%CIs values). The most common AEs were within the SOC 
‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ with the most common AE being Administration 
site  reactions.  Also,  Injection  related  reactions  were  commonly  reported  under  the  SOC  ‘Injury, 
poisoning and procedural complications’ but only one patient reported both ‘Injection related reaction’ 
and  ‘administration  site  reaction’.  All  other  administration  site  reactions  were  reported  in  1  patient 
each. Of note, Reactions at administration site is a known very common (≥1/10) AE according to the 
SmPC.  
Other  commonly  reported  AEs  were  reported  within  the  SOCs  ‘Gastrointestinal  reactions’  and  ‘Skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders’. Among the ‘Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’, a total of 10 
cases of Urticaria, Rash and Pruitus were reported; this could represent allergic reactions to Kineret. 
Of note, in the present study, there are no reports on allergic reactions; which according to the SmPC 
is an Uncommon adverse reaction (frequency: (≥1/1.000 to <1/100)).  
According to the SmPC, the most serious AE besides of ‘Anaphylactic reactions’ is ‘Serious infections’. 
A total of 52 cases of Infections were reported during the study. Seriousness of the reported infections 
is not reported but of note, the Table presents “AEs (non-serious AEs of at least moderate intensity 
Assessment report

and serious AEs)”. Overall, there is no pattern in the reported infections and no infections are reported 
in more than 6 cases; this includes Pneumonia (totally 5 cases) and gastroenteritis (totally 6 cases). 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (equivalent to MAS) is reported in a total of 12 cases; this is 
discussed further in section ‘7.2.4.5.  MAS as an event of special interest’ below.  
Overall, except for ‘Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis’ (MAS, reported in 12 cases), ‘Constipation’ 
(reported in 6 cases) is the only AEs reported in more than 5 cases, not already included in the SmPC. 
7.2.4.2.  Incidence proportions of AEs (including SAEs) 
The number of patients and incidence proportions of AEs (including non-serious AEs of at least 
moderate intensity and SAEs) in the complete set are presented by MedDRA SOC, PT and time window. 
SAEs have also been presented. 
Among the 306 patients included in the study, 99 patients experienced at least one AE, for an 
incidence proportion of 32.4% across an average treatment duration of 1.66 years. 
Overall, the total number of AEs was 201, meaning an average of 0.66 AEs per patient. Among the 
patients who had at least one AE the average was 2 AEs per patient. 
Considering the SOC categories, 11.8% of patients experienced events in SOC “Infections and 
infestations”, 7.5% of patients experienced events in SOC “Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders”, 
6.9% in SOC “General disorders and administration site conditions”, 5.2% in the SOCs 
“Gastrointestinal disorders” and “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications”, and 3.9% in SOC 
“Immune system disorders”. 
Overall, a higher frequency of patients experiencing AEs was observed during the first 6 months 
(incidence proportion=23.2%) and after 24 months (incidence proportion=19.2%) compared to other 
time windows (9.8% for 7-12 months, 7.6% for 13-18 months, 4.7% for 19-24 months). However, the 
number of patient years was much higher in the >24 month’s time window compared to the other time 
windows. When taking number of patient years into account, there was no increased frequency of AEs 
in the >24 month’s time window. Among the 306 patients of the study, 44 patients experienced at 
least one SAE, for an incidence proportion of 14.4%. The total number of SAEs was 56, meaning an 
overall average of 0.18 SAEs per patient. Among patients who had at least one SAE the average was 
1.3 SAEs per patient. 
The risk of experiencing SAEs was highest during the first 6 months (9.2%). The overall incidence 
showed that the most frequently reported SAEs were serious infections in 13 patients (4.2%), followed 
by 10 patients with MAS (3.3%) and 9 patients with events in the SOC “Injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications” (2.9%). In the >24 months’ time window, 8 patients experienced a total of 9 
SAE (1 febrile neutropenia, 2 MAS, 1 Epstein-Barr virus infection, 1 gastroenteritis, 1 tonsillitis, 1 
humerus fracture, 1 interstitial lung disease and 1 hip arthroplasty). 
CHMP comments 
A total of 99 patients experienced a total of 201 AEs of at least moderate intensity thus, approximately 
two-thirds  (209  patients,  68%)  did  not  report  any  AEs  of  at  least  moderate  in  intensity.  This  is 
reassuring. Of the 99 patients, 42 (42.4%) patients discontinued due to AEs and Intolerance.  
Overall, there are only small differences between the number of AEs and the number of patients with 
AEs (see section 6.2.4.1 ‘Adverse events by PT and SOC’ above). The most pronounced difference is 
observed in the SOC ‘Infections and infestations’, where 36 patients reported a total of 52 AEs. No 
specific  pattern  is  observed.  Five  (5)  patients  reported  neutropenia/pancytopenia  as  an  SAE.  It  is 
Assessment report

reassuring that the MAH informs that “None of the 5 patients reporting neutropenia/pancytopenia had 
infections.”  However, only 5 patients were reported to have neutropenia/pancytopenia but despite no 
clinical  symptoms  were  reported  among  these  patients,  it  is  agreed  that  this  is  a  SAE  due  to  the 
increased risk of infections, anaemia and/or bleedings. 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (equivalent to MAS) is reported in a total of 12 patients; this is 
discussed further in section ‘7.2.4.5.  MAS as an event of special interest’ below.  
7.2.4.3.  Serious adverse events by PT and SOC 
Table 4 in the clinical trial report reports the number of SAEs with the related IRs and 95% CI by SOC, 
PT overall and according to 5 consecutive time windows for Kineret treatment: 1-6 months, 7-12 
months, 13-18 months, 19-24 months and >24 months after first injection of Kineret. In Table 5 of the 
clinical trial report the same data are reported by overall PT by decreasing frequency of occurrence. 
A total of 56 SAEs was observed. Overall the IR was of 11.0 per 100 py (95% CI 7.9-15.2), with 
events within the SOC “Infections and Infestations” being the most reported (a total of 13 SAEs, 
IR=2.6 per 100 py), followed by “Immune system disorders” (a total of 11 SAEs, IR=2.2 per 100 py, 
all describing MAS). “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” covered 9 events, with an IR of 
1.8 per 100 py. The remaining SAEs had an IR below 1.0 per 100 py. 
SAEs occurred primarily during the first 6 months of treatment (IR=28.1 per 100 py during the 1-6 
month’s time window). After 24 months of Kineret treatment, the IR (IR=4.3 per 100 py) was lower 
than during the first 6 months of treatment. A tendency towards an increase in the SAE IR (IR=13.8 
per 100 py) was observed in the 13-18 months’ time window. However, in this time window, 144 
patients contributed only to 58.1 py with 95% CI of IR overlapping with the prior and subsequent time 
window. Moreover only 8 SAEs in total occurred in 6 patients. Among these 6 patients, 5 had re-
started the treatment with Kineret. 
Analyzing the SAEs by decreasing frequency of PT occurrence, MAS was the most reported event 
(n=11, IR=2.2 per 100 py) followed by injection-related reactions (n=6, IR=1.2 per 100 py). All 
remaining PTs had an IR below 1 event per 100 py.  
MAS was the most frequently reported PT. In one patient MAS was considered non-serious by the 
reporting physician: the event consisted of an isolated increase in ferritin levels (67390 mg/ml), 
Kineret treatment was not stopped and the physician did not report any MAS specific treatment. 
Events of MAS occurred primarily during the first 6 months of treatment, IR=6.0 per 100 py; in the 
time window >24 months, the IR of MAS was of 1.5 events per 100 py. 
No malignancies or SAEs leading to death occurred during Kineret exposure.  
CHMP comments 
A  total  of  56  serious  AEs  (SAEs)  were  reported  during  the  study;  IR(95%  CI):11.0(7.9-15.2).  The 
majority of SAEs were reported in the first time window, i.e. within the initial 6 months of treatment. 
Most SAEs were reported within the SOC ‘Injury, poisoning and procedural complications’ and were 
mainly  reported  to  be  Injection-  and  infusion  related  reactions  (8  cases  in  total).  Of  note,  in  the 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC ‘Administration site reactions’ is reported 
as a very common (≥1/10) AE. According to the SmPC, the reactions are most commonly reported 
within  the  first 2  weeks’  treatment  and  disappear  within 4-6  weeks.  This  is  in  line  with the  results 
from the present study, where the majority of ‘Administration site reactions’ were reported within the 
initial  6  months.  The  SmPC  also  states  “In  43  CAPS  patients  followed  for  up  to  5  years  no  patient 
permanently or temporarily discontinued Kineret treatment due to injection site reactions.” The MAH 
Assessment report

has committed to submit a Type II variation application to include information regarding Injection site 
reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The application will be submitted during year 2020. 
With  the  exception  of  the  Injection  related  reactions  (IR[95%CI]  =  1.2[0.5-2.6])  and 
Haemophagocytic  lymphohistiocytosis  (equivalent  to  macrophage  activation  syndrome  (MAS)) 
(IR[95%CI] = 2.2[1.1-4.1]), no PT SAEs were reported with an IR[95%CI] >1.0 which is reassuring. 
Haemophagocytic  lymphohistiocytosis  (MAS)  is  discussed  in  section  ‘7.2.4.5.    MAS  as  an  event  of 
special interest’ below. 
7.2.4.4.  AEs (including SAEs) in patients with continuous Kineret treatment 
The number of AEs (including non-serious AEs of at least moderate intensity and SAEs) and the related 
incidence rates in the long-treatment sets -12, -18 and 24 are presented by SOC, PT and time window 
in Table 9, Table 11 and Table 13 of the clinical trial report, respectively. The number and incidence 
rates of SAEs in the long-treatment sets -12, -18 and 24 are presented by SOC, PT and time window in 
Table 10, Table 12 and Table 14 of the clinical trial report, respectively. 
An overall IR of 20.9 per 100 py for AEs and 5.1 per 100 py for SAEs were observed for the long-term 
treatment set-12. Among AEs, Infections and infestations was the most frequent SOC, with the highest 
incidence during the first 6 months (15.7 per 100 py). The remaining SOCs showed an overall IR 
ranging between 1.2 and 2.2 per 100 py. 
Among SAEs, the SOCs “Infections and infestations”, and “Injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications” were equally represented with an IR of 1.2 per 100 py. The SOC “Immune system 
disorders” (MAS) had an incidence of 1.0 per 100 py. 
Similar results were seen in the long-term treatment set-18 and -24, with an overall IR of AEs of 14.3 
per 100 py) and 13.5 per 100 py, respectively. SAEs were represented with an incidence of 3.8 per 
100 py and 2.9 per 100 py, respectively; also the distribution of AEs and SAEs involved the same 
categories as in the long-term treatment set-12. In the >24 months treatment window of the long-
term treatment set -24, covering 168.8 patient years in 86 patients, there were a total of 22 AEs 
reported spread over 13 different SOCs. Among the 22 AEs, 5 were serious (2 MAS, 1 Humerus 
fracture, 1 Interstitial lung disease and 1 Hip arthroplasty).  
CHMP comments 
These results are in line with the results presented in the previous section. The majority of AEs were 
reported in the first treatment period (i.e. within the first 6 months) and the SOCs with most AEs and 
SAEs were ‘Infections and infestations’ and ‘Injury, poisoning and procedural complications’. 
Please see previous sections for further assessment.  
7.2.4.5.  MAS as an event of special interest 
In total, 11 patients experienced 12 events (11 SAEs and 1 non-serious AE) of MAS on Kineret 
treatment. The IR of the first occurrence was 2.2 per 100 py Table 5. 
Ten patients had a previous history of MAS at baseline. Nine of these patients did not experience any 
new episodes while on Kineret. One patient with history of MAS at baseline had 2 additional episodes 
of MAS during Kineret treatment. 
The IR for first occurrence of MAS while on Kineret was lower in patients without a history of MAS (IR 
(95% CI) = 2.1 per 100 py (1.1-3.9). The IR for a second occurrence of MAS was higher (IR=16.1 per 
Assessment report  
EMA/297768/2020

100 py) compared to IR of the first occurrence. However, it should be noted that only 1 patient had a 
second occurrence. 
The average time since first injection with Kineret until the first occurrence of MAS during simultaneous 
Kineret treatment was 9 months (Table 6). During Kineret treatment, 36.4% of MAS events occurred 
during the first 30 days of treatment and 36.3% occurred 6 months or more after the first injection. 
The shortest time from baseline to a MAS event was 4 days. The frequency of MAS did not increase 
during continued treatment (Table 6). 
After stopping Kineret, MAS was reported in 8 patients (Table 7). The earliest recurrence occurred in 
the time window 90-180 days. There was no indication of a “rebound effect” after discontinuing 
Kineret, i.e. no indication of an increase in MAS incidence immediately after stopping Kineret. Different 
triggers have been identified as possible causes of MAS (Table 8), disease flares (4 events, 33.3%), 
changes of treatments (3 events, 25.0%), and infections (2 events, 16.7%) being the most frequent.

CHMP comments 
During the study period, 11 patients (3.6%) experienced 12 episodes of MAS (one patient experienced 
two  episodes;  this  patient  had  a  history  of  MAS  prior  to  Kineret  treatment).  It  is  well-known  that 
patients with Still’s disease have an increased risk of spontaneous development of MAS. It is also well-
known  that  MAS  often  develops  due  to  certain  triggers  including  infections  and  certain  medication 
however, a causal relationship between Kineret and MAS has not (yet) been established. The present 
study is not designed to decide on a potential relationship between Kineret and MAS (of note, it has 
been reported that MAS occurs in up to 25% of the patients with SJIA). In the present study, the IR 
for  first  episode  of  MAS  during  Kineret  treatment  was  2.1/100  py  (95%CI:  11-3.9).  There  was  no 
pattern in the timing of MAS in relation to duration of Kineret treatment. 
The MAH reports on trigger events. In 3 (25%) cases, change of treatment was considered to be the 
trigger event. The MAH should describe the changes in medication for these 3 patients in more details.  
Further, in the present SmPC, the only information concerning MAS in section 4.8 is as follows: “There 
are  no  indications  either  from  this  study  or  from  post-marketing  adverse  reaction  reports  that  the 
Assessment report

overall safety profile in patients with CAPS or Still’s disease is different from that in patients with RA, 
with  the  exception  of  the  risk  for  development  of  MAS  in  patients  with  Still’s  disease.  The  adverse 
reactions table below therefore applies to Kineret treatment of RA, CAPS and Still’s disease. Additional 
information on MAS is provided below.” However, the MAH has committed to submit a Type II variation 
application to include updated information regarding MAS in (section 4.4 and) section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The application will be submitted during year 2020.  
7.3.  PRAC’s Discussion and Conclusion 
7.3.1.  Discussion 
Kineret (anakinra, ATC code: L04AC03) is a human IL-1 receptor antagonist that blocks the biological 
activity of cytokine IL-1 (IL-1α and IL-1β) by competitively inhibiting its binding to the IL-1 receptor 
type 1. In 2018, Kineret was approved in the EU/EEA in adult and paediatric patients for the treatment 
of Still's disease, including SJIA and AOSD, with the following wording of the labelled indication: “for 
the treatment of Still’s disease […] with active systemic features of moderate to high disease activity, 
or in patients with continued disease activity after treatment with NSAIDs or glucocorticoids.” 
The present PAS study was agreed upon with EMA in Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0056. The 
PASS was included in Section III.2-3 of the Kineret EU RMP version 4.5, as a category 3 activity. The 
primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the long-term safety of Kineret in paediatric 
patients with Still's disease in routine clinical care, including the risk of MAS. 
The study was an international, non-interventional, single-armed, pharmacovigilance registry study of 
long-term safety utilizing available data from the Pharmachild JIA registry. Patients included were male 
and female patients diagnosed with SJIA according to the Pharmachild JIA registry study criteria and 
treated with Kineret. There were no restrictions with regard to disease duration or severity other than 
patients were treated with anakinra. There were also no restrictions with regard to the patients’ 
demographics or baseline characteristics. This is endorsed as this optimized the possibility of including 
more patients into the study and also to obtain ‘real world’ data.  
The safety-related variables were according to the data obtained from the Pharmachild JIA registry. 
Overall, the safety-related outcomes are considered to be in accordance with the objectives of the 
study. Due to the study design, it is not possible to include information regarding mild AEs however, 
information regarding discontinuation due to AEs (including mild AEs) was collected. As this is a PASS, 
it is considered acceptable that only data regarding moderate and severe AEs as well as SAEs are 
included. The MAH has adequately and sufficiently discussed the data sources, risks of bias, data 
management including handling of missing data and the statistical methods. Due to the study design, 
no sample size calculation was made, this is accepted. A medical monitor evaluated all reported AEs. 
The focus was to ensure the right diagnoses (ILAR) and adverse events and if necessary, the medical 
monitor was able to raise queries to the centers and request further clarifications. All information 
remained blinded. 
A total of 306 patients from 15 different countries were included in the study. The majority of the 
patients (299 patients; 97.7%) were from Europe. A total of 13 European countries from all 
geographical parts of Europe (Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western parts) contributed with data. 
Thus, the results are considered to be representative for the European population.

Boys and girls were equally represented, which is in accordance with the disease characteristics. 
Median and mean age at time of Kineret treatment was 8.0 and 8.2 years, respectively with min and 
max age being 0.8 and 20.3 years, respectively. Approximately 2/3 (69%) of the patients were <12 
years old. Mean time from diagnosis till initiation of Kineret treatment was 2.0 years. As only 5 
patients were ≥18 years, this is not considered to impact the results in any clinically relevant degree.  
It is reassuring that almost half (46%) of the patients were at some point treated for at least 12 
months and approximately one-fourth (28%) were treated for at least 24 months. The majority 
(n=259; 85%) of patients were only treated with one course of Kineret and only very few (n=6; <2%) 
of the patients received ≥3 treatment courses. 
Overall, the majority (3/4) of the patients discontinued Kineret treatment at some time during the 
study period. At all time windows, the most common reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy 
(23.5-50.0%) with the percentage of patients discontinuing for this reason despite variations, being 
fairly stable over time. This indicates that patients who initially benefit from the treatment may not 
continue doing so. After 19 months treatment, approximately half of the patients had discontinued due 
to lack of efficacy. When looking at baseline characteristics, there were no predictive factors for the 
group of patients discontinuing due to lack of efficacy (e.g. disease severity, age, etc.). 
The second most common reason for discontinuation of Kineret treatment was remission (reported in 
18.3-55.9% of the discontinuations). The proportion increased over time (up to 18 months) indicating 
that long-term treatment may result in remission of the disease. This is reassuring. When looking at 
baseline characteristics, there were no predictive factors for the group of patients who obtained 
remission of the disease (e.g. disease severity, prior treatments, etc.). 
A total of 30.7% of the patients were not treated with any of the listed products prior to Kineret. The 
most common treatment prior to initiation of Kineret was ‘Glucocorticoids only’, ‘bDMARDs only’ and a 
combination of these. This is in accordance with the treatment guidelines. Twenty (20; 65.4%) 
patients were treated with a triple- or quatro- combination of drugs. 
Totally 78 (36.8%) patients continued initial treatment after initiation of Kineret. The most common 
combination was Kineret + glucocorticoids. It is well-known that treatment with high-dose 
glucocorticoids should be gradually reduced. However, among the 42 patients, who were concomitantly 
treated with both Kineret and glucocorticoid, 31 (74%) patients were treated with glucocorticoids for 
≥2 months. This may indicate that for these patients the concomitant treatment was therapeutic 
rather than a short overlapping period when tapping down the glucocorticoid treatment. 
Adverse events (AEs) of at least moderate severity was the third most common reason for 
discontinuations within the first 6 months (15.6%). Additionally, mild AEs and Intolerance were 
reported in 3.7% and 7.3% of the discontinuations, respectively. Discontinuations due to AEs (any 
degree) and Intolerance decreased over time indicating that at least the most severe/bothersome AEs 
were most common in the beginning of the treatment. 
Among the 306 patients included in the study, a total of 201 AEs were identified. The overall IR was 
39.5 (95% CI 30.8-50.6) per 100 py. For all SOCs, the majority of AEs were reported within the first 6 
months of treatment (confirmed by non-overlapping 95%CIs values). The most common AEs were 
within the SOC ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ with the most common AE being 
Administration site reactions. Also Injection related reactions were commonly reported under the SOC 
‘Injury, poisoning and procedural complications’. Of note, Reactions at administration site is a known 
very common (≥1/10) AE according to the SmPC. 
Other commonly reported AEs were reported within the SOCs ‘Gastrointestinal reactions’ and ‘Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders’. Among the ‘Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’, a total of 10 
Assessment report  
EMA/297768/2020  
Page 35/55 
 
 
 
cases of Urticaria, Rash and Pruritus were reported; this could represent allergic reactions to Kineret. 
Of note, in the present study, there are no reports on allergic reactions; which according to the SmPC 
is an Uncommon adverse reaction (frequency: (≥1/1.000 to <1/100)).  
According to the SmPC, the most serious AE besides of ‘Anaphylactic reactions’ is ‘Serious infections’. A 
total of 52 cases of Infections were reported during the study. Seriousness of the reported infections is 
not reported but of note, the Table presents “AEs (non-serious AEs of at least moderate intensity and 
serious AEs)”. Overall, there is no pattern in the reported infections and no infections are reported in 
more than 6 cases; this includes Pneumonia (totally 5 cases) and gastroenteritis (totally 6 cases). 
Overall, except for ‘Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis’ (MAS, reported in 12 cases), ‘Constipation’ 
(reported in 6 cases) is the only AEs reported in more than 5 cases, not already included in the SmPC. 
However, constipation is a common disorder among children in general, and no update of the SmPC is 
needed. 
A total of 99 patients experienced a total of 201 AEs of at least moderate intensity thus, approximately 
two-thirds (209 patients, 68%) did not report any AEs of at least moderate in intensity. This is 
reassuring. Of the 99 patients, 42 (42.4%) patients discontinued due to AEs and Intolerance.  
Overall, there are only small differences between the number of AEs and the number of patients with 
AEs. The most pronounced difference is observed in the SOC ‘Infections and infestations’, where 36 
patients reported a total of 52 AEs. No specific pattern is observed. Five (5) patients reported 
neutropenia/pancytopenia; which is a (potential) serious AE. It is reassuring that in the present study, 
none of the patients developed symptoms (e.g. infections). 
A total of 56 serious AEs (SAEs) were reported during the study; IR(95% CI):11.0(7.9-15.2). The 
majority of SAEs were reported in the first time window, i.e. within the initial 6 months of treatment. 
Most SAEs were reported within the SOC ‘Injury, poisoning and procedural complications’ and were 
mainly reported to be Injection- and infusion related reactions (8 cases in total). Of note, in the 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC ‘Administration site reactions’ is reported 
as a very common (≥1/10) AE. According to the SmPC, the reactions are most commonly reported 
within the first 2 weeks’ treatment and disappear within 4-6 weeks. This is in line with the results from 
the present study, where the majority of ‘Administration site reactions’ were reported within the initial 
6 months. The SmPC also states “In 43 CAPS patients followed for up to 5 years no patient 
permanently or temporarily discontinued Kineret treatment due to injection site reactions.” Considered 
that this study reports a total of 10 cases of Infusion-/injection-related reactions, and Injection site 
pain/reaction graduated as serious AEs, it is endorsed that the MAH plans to submit a Type II variation 
application later in Year 2020 including an update of the information regarding Injection related 
reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
With the exception of the Injection related reactions (IR[95%CI] = 1.2[0.5-2.6]) and 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (equivalent to macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)) 
(IR[95%CI] = 2.2[1.1-4.1]), no PT SAEs were reported with an IR[95%CI] >1.0 which is reassuring.  
During the study period, 11 patients (3.6%) experienced 12 episodes of MAS (one patient experienced 
two episodes; this patient had a history of MAS prior to Kineret treatment). It is well-known that 
patients with Still’s disease have an increased risk of spontaneous development of MAS. It is also well-
known that MAS often develops due to certain triggers including infections and certain medication 
however, a causal relationship between Kineret and MAS has not (yet) been established. The present 
study is not designed to decide on a potential relationship between Kineret and MAS (of note, it has 
been reported that MAS occurs in up to 25% of the patients with SJIA). In the present study, the IR 
Assessment report  
EMA/297768/2020  
Page 36/55 
 
 
 
for first episode of MAS during Kineret treatment was 2.1/100 py (95%CI: 11-3.9). There was no 
pattern in the timing of MAS in relation to duration of Kineret treatment. 
The MAH reports on trigger events. In 3 (25%) cases, change of treatment was considered to be the 
trigger event. The MAH should describe the changes in medication for these 3 patients in more details.  
Further, in the present SmPC, the only information concerning MAS in section 4.8 is as follows: “There 
are no indications either from this study or from post-marketing adverse reaction reports that the 
overall safety profile in patients with CAPS or Still’s disease is different from that in patients with RA, 
with the exception of the risk for development of MAS in patients with Still’s disease. The adverse 
reactions table below therefore applies to Kineret treatment of RA, CAPS and Still’s disease. Additional 
information on MAS is provided below.” Therefore, it is endorsed that the MAH plans to submit a Type 
II variation application later in Year 2020 including an update of the information regarding MAS in the 
Kineret SmPC. 
7.3.2.  Conclusion 
Despite limitations due to the study design, the present study provides valuable information regarding 
Kineret-treatment of children and adolescents with Still’s disease. The reported safety profile is mostly 
in line with the observations from previous studies (e.g. the pivotal phase III study used for the MAA). 
The MAH has committed to submit a Type II variation application for relevant updates of the SmPC; this 
application will be submitted within year 2020.  
The benefit-risk balance of Kineret (anakinra) remains positive. 
8.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 5.1, signed 16th December 2019 with data lock point of 1st 
May 2018, with this application. The (main) proposed RMP changes were the following: 
•  Update of the RMP to reflect completion of the PASS study in patients with Still’s disease 
(Sobi.ANAKIN-302). 
The currently approved RMP version is 4.9, approved 14th March 2019 under procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0064/G. 
Version 5.0 is under evaluation in procedure EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0070 covering a proposed new 
indication, Familial Mediterranean fever. 
Version 5.1, subject of this procedure, builds further on version 5.0 rather than from approved version 
4.9.

The summary table in annex 8 accurately reflects the changes from RMP version 4.9 to version 5.1. 
Following completion of the variation EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0070, the MAH submitted a compiled RMP 
(RMP version 5.3) taking into account the RMP changes approved in the variation 
EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0070 (RMP version 5.2) and the changes proposed in the current variation (RMP 
version 5.1). 
8.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP version 5.3 are acceptable.  
9.  Request for supplementary information 
9.1.  Major objections 
No major objections have been identified.  
9.2.  Other concerns 
9.2.1.  Clinical aspects 
Question 1 (Methods):  
It is informed that “A medical monitor evaluated all reported AEs. This person was able to raise queries 
to the centers and request further clarifications.” However, it is unclear, what exactly was evaluated by 
the medical monitor, whether any changes/corrections made by the medical monitor were recorded and 
whether the medical monitor was independent from the study. This should be clarified by the MAH.  
Question 2 (Duration of Kineret treatment):  
The majority of patients were only treated with one course of Kineret however, it is informed that the 
306  patients  had  a  total  of  360  treatment  courses.  The  MAH  should  inform  how  many  patients  were 
treated with 1, 2, 3 etc. courses of Kineret during the observation period. 
Question 3 (Reasons for Kineret treatment discontinuation):  
The MAH is asked to discuss if there are any predictive factors for the group of patients discontinuing 
due to lack of efficacy (e.g. disease severity, age, etc.). 
Question 4 (Reasons for Kineret treatment discontinuation):  
The MAH is asked to discuss if there are any predictive factors for the group of patients who obtained 
remission of the disease (e.g. disease severity, prior treatments, etc.).  
Assessment report  
EMA/297768/2020  
Page 39/55 
 
 
 
Question 5 (Reasons for Kineret treatment discontinuation):  
The MAH should inform if discontinuation due to AEs or Intolerance was more pronounced among patients 
concomitantly being treated with other medication compared to patients in mono-therapy with Kineret. 
Question 6 (Concomitant medications):  
A total of 30.7% of the patients were not treated with any of the listed products prior to Kineret. The 
MAH  should  discuss  this  proportion  and  inform  if  these  patients  were  clustered  from  single 
centers/countries or characterized with e.g. mild disease. 
Question 7 (Concomitant medications):  
The  MAH  is  asked  to  present  data  for  the  number  of  patients  with  concomitant  treatment  with 
glucocorticoids 1 and 2 months after initiation with Kineret as this may provide an indication of whether 
the  concomitant  treatment  was  (therapeutic)  intended  or  represented  a  temporary  overlap  of 
treatments. 
Question 8 (Adverse events by PT and SOC):  
The most common AEs were within the SOC ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ with 
the most common AE being Administration site reactions. Also Injection related reactions were commonly 
reported  under  the  SOC  ‘Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications’  It  is  unclear  whether  the 
majority of these AEs are reported by the same patients; please clarify.  
Question 9 (Adverse events by PT and SOC):  
The MAH should inform if the 5 patients reporting neutropenia and pancytopenia also reported infections- 
or infestation-related AEs. 
Question 10 (Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)): 
The MAH reports on trigger events. In 3 (25%) cases, change of treatment was considered to be the 
trigger event. The MAH should describe the changes in medication for these 3 patients in more details.   
9.2.2.  Aspects related to Product information  
Question 11 (Incidence proportions of (S)AEs): 
The MAH is asked to discuss if GI AEs including ‘Constipation’ should be included in the Tabulated list of 
adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC for Kineret. 
Question 12 (Serious adverse events by PT and SOC): 
The SmPC for Kineret states “In 43 CAPS patients followed for up to 5 years no patient permanently or 
temporarily discontinued Kineret treatment due to injection site reactions.” Considered that this study 
reports  a  total  of  10  cases  of  Infusion-/injection-related  reactions,  and  Injection  site  pain/reaction 
graduated as serious AEs, the MAH is asked to inform if any of these SAEs led to discontinuation of the 
treatment and to discuss if the new data requires an update of the information provided in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. 
Question 13 (Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)): 
The MAH should consider updating section 4.8 of the SmPC with more information regarding MAS (cross-
reference to section 4.4 would be relevant).

supplementary information 
10.1.  Clinical aspects 
10.1.1.  Major objections  
 No major objections were identified.  
10.1.2.  Other concerns  
Question 1 (Methods):  
It is informed that “A medical monitor evaluated all reported AEs. This person was able to raise queries 
to the centers and request further clarifications.” However, it is unclear, what exactly was evaluated by 
the medical monitor, whether any changes/corrections made by the medical monitor were recorded and 
whether the medical monitor was independent from the study. This should be clarified by the MAH.  
MAH’s  response:  The  medical  monitor  of  the  Pharmachild  registry  is  a  pediatric  immunologist  and 
pediatric  rheumatologist  from  Utrecht  (the  Netherlands).  The  medical  monitor  is  also  the  principle 
investigator of one of the PRINTO sites collecting data in Pharmachild, however all data remained blinded 
and therefore the medical monitor was unable to identify patients from their own site. During the safety 
review, the medical monitor was able to check that all appropriate patient data had been entered in the 
electronic database and raise queries in case of missing data. 
The medical monitor had access to all entered data but the safety review was focused on safety reports, 
drug history and ILAR diagnosis. The medical monitor did not “correct” or update any of the data entered 
by the sites. If further clarifications were needed the medical monitor raised a query to the sites. The 
medical review performed by the medical monitor was documented in a dedicated field within the eCRF, 
existing for all safety events. 
The Pharmachild medical monitor is MedDRA certified and was able to code the safety events separately 
to the local site coding and PRINTO coordinating centre. Specific AEs (e.g. infections) were also coded 
by  an  adjudication  committee.  Any  discrepancy  between  the  centre  coding,  PRINTO  coding,  medical 
monitor and, if available adjudication committee are solved by consensus (more details in Giancane et 
al. 2020). 
CHMP comments  
The MAH has clarified that the data remained blinded for the medical monitor. The focus was to ensure 
the right diagnoses (ILAR) and adverse events. It was informed that the medical monitor also was the 
principle  investigator  of  one  of  the  PRINTO  sites  thus  theoretical,  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  the 
medical monitor recognized his/her ‘own’ patients. However, a total of 259 patients were included in 
the study. Overall, this is not expected to affect the study results, and the issue will not be pursued.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved.

Question 2 (Duration of Kineret treatment):  
The majority of patients were only treated with one course of Kineret however, it is informed that the 
306  patients  had  a  total  of  360  treatment  courses.  The  MAH  should  inform  how  many  patients  were 
treated with 1, 2, 3 etc. courses of Kineret during the observation period. 
MAH’s response: In CSR section 10.4.1 second paragraph and in the CSR Table 19 it is stated that 306 
patients had a total of 360 courses of Kineret treatment. The number of patients treated with 1, 2, 3 or 
4  courses  is  presented  in Table  1.  The  majority  of the  patients  (n=259, 84.64 %)  had  one  course of 
treatment. 
CHMP comments  
The MAH has presented the requested data. As observed in Table 1 above, the majority (85%) of the 
patients  received  one  course  of  Kineret  treatment  and  only  very  few  (n=6;  <2%)  of  the  patients 
received ≥3 treatment courses.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved.  
Question 3 (Reasons for Kineret treatment discontinuation):  
The MAH is asked to discuss if there are any predictive factors for the group of patients discontinuing 
due to lack of efficacy (e.g. disease severity, age, etc.). 
MAH’s response: The study sample size was not based on any formal calculation. All patients enrolled 
in the Pharmachild JIA registry study before September 30, 2018 meeting the criteria defined for the 
study population were included in the study. The purpose of the study was to describe long-term safety 
of Kineret, utilizing all Kineret treated SJIA patients in an already available registry and therefore no a 
priori statistical power estimation was performed. Evaluation of predictive factors 
for discontinuation of Kineret due to inefficacy were not part of the study objectives, therefore the MAH 
did not prespecify any predictive analyses in the analysis plan and refrains from performing, interpreting 
and drawing any conclusions regarding potential predictive factors in this post-hoc setting. 
In response to Question 3, the MAH provides Table 2, that shows baseline characteristics grouped by 
those  patients  who  at  least  once  discontinued  due  to  inefficacy  vs  all  remaining  patients  (including 
patients who discontinued due to other reasons and patients who did not discontinue treatment). In this 
study, data on disease severity was not available.

As  requested,  the  MAH  has  presented baseline  characteristics  for  the patients  discontinuing  due to 
inefficacy (n=103; 34%) and likewise also for all remaining patients (n=203; 66%). It is agreed with 
the MAH that there are no clear differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. There 
was a numeric tendency towards patients discontinuing due to inefficacy were more often previously

treated  with  monotherapy.  This  most  likely  mirror  that  in  these  patients,  monotherapy  was  not 
sufficient.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved.  
Question 4 (Reasons for Kineret treatment discontinuation):  
The MAH is asked to discuss if there are any predictive factors for the group of patients who obtained 
remission of the disease (e.g. disease severity, prior treatments, etc.).  
MAH’s response: The study sample size was not based on any formal calculation. All patients enrolled 
in the Pharmachild JIA registry study before September 30, 2018 meeting the criteria defined for the 
study population were included in the study. The purpose of the study was to describe long-term safety 
of Kineret, utilizing all Kineret treated SJIA patients in an already available registry and therefore no a 
priori statistical power estimation was performed. Evaluation of predictive factors 
for discontinuation of Kineret due to remission were not part of the study objectives, therefore the MAH 
did not prespecify any predictive analyses in the analysis plan and refrains from performing, interpreting 
and drawing any conclusions regarding potential predictive factors in this post-hoc setting. 
In response to Question 4, the MAH provides Table 3, that shows baseline characteristics grouped by 
those  patients  who  at  least  once  discontinued  due  to  remission  vs  all  remaining  patients  (including 
patients who discontinued due to other reasons and patients who did not discontinue treatment). 
There are differences in standards of care between different countries which might influence the rate of 
discontinuation when in remission.

CHMP comments  
As  requested,  the  MAH  has  presented baseline  characteristics  for  the patients  discontinuing  due to 
remission (n=85; 28%) and for all remaining patients (n=221; 72%). The MAH informs that “There 
are  differences  in  standards  of  care  between  different  countries  which  might  influence  the  rate  of 
discontinuation when in remission”. This is acknowledged.   
Conclusion: Issue resolved.  
Question 5 (Reasons for Kineret treatment discontinuation):  
The MAH should inform if discontinuation due to AEs or Intolerance was more pronounced among patients 
concomitantly being treated with other medication compared to patients in monotherapy with Kineret. 
MAH’s response: There was no marked difference in the frequency of discontinuation due to AEs or 
intolerance among patients concomitantly being treated with other medication compared to patients in 
monotherapy with Kineret (Table 4).

CHMP comments  
As requested, the MAH has presented data for reasons for discontinuations for the group of patients 
treated  with  monotherapy  with  Kineret  and  for  patients  treated  with  Kineret  +  another  treatment. 
Numeric,  slightly  more  patients  with  concomitant  treatment  discontinued  due  to  AE  and/or 
intolerance; this could be explained by the fact that concomitant treatment increases the risk of more 
adverse events, but the differences are small and neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved.  
Question 6 (Concomitant medications):  
A total of 30.7% of the patients were not treated with any of the listed products prior to Kineret. The 
MAH  should  discuss  this  proportion  and  inform  if  these  patients  were  clustered  from  single 
centers/countries or characterized with e.g. mild disease. 
MAH’s response: Among the 306 patients included in the present study, 94 patients (30.7%) were not 
previously  treated  because  Kineret  was  started  at  disease  diagnosis  (date  of  diagnosis  was  almost 
identical to Kineret start date). Regarding the geographic distribution of patients: among the 94 patients, 
49 (52.1%) were enrolled in the Netherlands (2 centers), 15 (16.0%) from Spain (4 centers), 14 (14.9%) 
from  France  (1  center)  and  9  (9.6%)  from  Italy  (3  centers)  (Table  5).  The  majority  of  the  patients 
without  prior  therapy  before  starting  Kineret  were  enrolled  from  only  two  centers.  One  center  in  the 
Netherlands enrolled 41 out of 94 (43.6%), and one center in Spain enrolled 10 out of 94 (9.4%) patients 
in this category respectively (Table 6). 
In this study, data on disease severity was not available.

CHMP comments  
The MAH informs that the 94 patients initiating Kineret at time of diagnosis (thus without previous 
treatment with e.g. glucocorticoids) were enrolled from the Netherlands (49 patients; 52%), Spain 
(15 patients; 16%), France (14 patients;15%) and Italy (9 patients; 10%). Half (n=51; 53%) of the 
94  patients  were  enrolled  from  two  centres  (one  in  the  Netherlands  and  one  in  Spain).  This  may 
indicate that the choice of treatment is at least to a certain degree according to local (national and 
centre-specific) guidelines. Overall, the pattern is in accordance with the development of treatment 
recommendations of patients with Still’s disease: Historically, most patients were initially treated with 
NSAIDs  and  glucocorticoids  but  due  to  the  adverse  event  profile  of  long-term  treatment  with 
glucocorticoids, biologic agents, especially the interleukin (IL) 1 and IL-6 inhibitors, are being used 
more  and  more  as  single  therapy  at  disease  onset  because  they  are  effective  in  reducing  clinical 
symptoms in patients with disease refractory to NSAID and glucocorticoid therapy.   
Conclusion: Issue resolved.  
Question 7 (Concomitant medications):  
The  MAH  is  asked  to  present  data  for  the  number  of  patients  with  concomitant  treatment  with 
glucocorticoids 1 and 2 months after initiation with Kineret as this may provide an indication of whether 
the  concomitant  treatment  was  (therapeutic)  intended  or  represented  a  temporary  overlap  of 
treatments. 
MAH’s  response:  Out  of  306  patients,  94  (30.7  %)  had  not  been  treated  with  either  sDMARDs, 
bDMARDs or glucocorticoids before starting with Kineret (see CSR Table 21). The remaining 212 patients

(69.3 %, derived from CSR Table 21) had received at least one of these treatments. Among the 212 
patients, 78 (36.8 %) were treated with various combinations of sDMARDs, bDMARDs and glucocorticoids 
before starting with Kineret and also continued with those concomitantly with Kineret treatment. Among 
the  78  patients,  42  (53.8 %)  continued  glucocorticoids  after  initiation  of  Kineret  (Table  21).  In  more 
detail, 11 (26.2 %) patients had concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids up to 1 month after start of 
Kineret, 5 (11.9 %) patients up to 2 months and for 26 (61.9 %) patients for more 2 months (median 
duration was 264 days, min=64, max=1217, 1q=118, 3q=642, mean=407, sdv=376). 
CHMP comments  
Approximately  one-third  of  the  patients  had  not  been  treated  with  any  DMARDs  or  glucocorticoids 
prior  to  initiation  of  Kineret.  Of  the  212  (69%)  patients  who  had  been treated  with  glucocorticoids 
and/or DMARD(s), approximately two-third (n=134; 63%) of the patients discontinued the DMARD/ 
glucocorticoid  treatment  when  initiating  treatment  with  Kineret.  A  total  of  42  (54%)  were  treated 
concomitantly with both Kineret and glucocorticoid, and of these patients, 31 (74%) were treated with 
glucocorticoids for ≥2 months. This indicates that for these patients the concomitant treatment was 
therapeutic rather than a short overlapping period when tapping down the glucocorticoid treatment.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved.  
Question 8 (Adverse events by PT and SOC):  
The most common AEs were within the SOC ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ with 
the most common AE being Administration site reactions. Also Injection related reactions were commonly 
reported  under  the  SOC  ‘Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications’  It  is  unclear  whether  the 
majority of these AEs are reported by the same patients; please clarify.  
MAH’s response: The CSR Table 7 shows the number of patients who had at least one AE per PT/SOC, 
while  the  CSR  Table  2  and  3  show  the  number  of  AEs.  For  example,  for  SOC  ‘General  disorders  and 
administration site conditions’ there was a total of 23 AEs (CSR Table 2) for 21 patients (CSR Table 7). 
Similarly, for the PT ‘Injection related reaction’ belonging to the SOC ‘Injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications’, there was a total of 10 AEs (CSR Table 2) for 10 patients (CSR Table 7).  
1  patient  who  reported  an  ‘Injection  related  reaction’  (belonging  to  the  SOC  ‘Injury,  poisoning  and 
procedural complications’) also reported an administration site reaction in the SOC ‘General disorders 
and administration site conditions’ (‘Injection site reaction’). All other administration site reactions were 
reported in 1 patient each. 
CHMP comments  
The  MAH  has  clarified  that  only  one  patient  reported  both  ‘Injection  related  reaction’  and 
‘administration site reaction’. All other administration site reactions were reported in 1 patient each. 
Conclusion: Issue resolved.  
Question 9 (Adverse events by PT and SOC):  
The MAH should inform if the 5 patients reporting neutropenia and pancytopenia also reported infections- 
or infestation-related AEs. 
MAH’s response: None of the 5 patients reporting neutropenia/pancytopenia had infections.

CHMP comments  
The MAH has clarified that “None of the 5 patients reporting neutropenia/pancytopenia had infections.” 
–  This  indicate  that  neutropenia/pancytopenia  was  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  clinical 
symptoms (e.g. infections) however, only 5 patients were reported to have neutropenia/pancytopenia 
thus no conclusions or generalisations (to all patients with cytopenia/neutropenia) can be made. 
Conclusion: Issue resolved.  
Question 10 (Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)): 
The MAH reports on trigger events. In 3 (25%) cases, change of treatment was considered to be the 
trigger event. The MAH should describe the changes in medication for these 3 patients in more details.   
MAH’s response: The EC approval for the Pharmachild study, as well as the ICF signed by the patients, 
allows PRINTO to share summary data with pharmaceutical companies. Additional approval is however 
needed for sharing of raw data. No specific/additional EC approval has been sought for this PAS study 
as  PRINTO  has  not  shared  any  raw  data  with  the  MAH  and  the  study  only  reports  summary  outputs. 
Therefore,  the  study  report  and  this  response  cannot  include  any  patient  listings  and/or  patient 
narratives. Due to this the MAH cannot provide the details requested for the 3 patients mentioned in the 
question. 
CHMP comments  
The MAH has informed that “the study report and this response cannot include any patient listings 
and/or patient narratives.” This is accepted and the issue will not be pursued.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved.  
10.1.3.  Aspects related to Product information 
Question 11 (Incidence proportions of (S)AEs): 
The MAH is asked to discuss if GI AEs including ‘Constipation’ should be included in the Tabulated list of 
adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC for Kineret. 
MAH’s response: There were 18 AEs of at least moderate intensity in the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders 
reported in 16 patients out of 306 patients in this study (CSR Table 2 and CSR Table 7). The study does 
not include a control arm and therefore no conclusions on causal relationship could be drawn. However, 
gastrointestinal symptoms are common in the general pediatric population. 
The most frequently reported event in the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders was constipation, with 6 events 
reported in 6 patients. Constipation is a common symptom in the general population with up to 29.6% 
children  globally  developing  symptoms  (Rajindrajith  and  Devanarayana  2011).  The  MAH  therefore 
considers that there is no reason to add GI events including Constipation to 4.8 in the SmPC. 
CHMP comments  
The MAH has sufficiently justified that GI AEs (including ‘Constipation’) should not be included in the 
tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The MAH argues that Constipation is a 
common condition among children which is acknowledged.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved.

Question 12 (Serious adverse events by PT and SOC): 
The SmPC for Kineret states “In 43 CAPS patients followed for up to 5 years no patient permanently or 
temporarily discontinued Kineret treatment due to injection site reactions.” Considered that this study 
reports  a  total  of  10  cases  of  Infusion-/injection-related  reactions,  and  Injection  site  pain/reaction 
graduated as serious AEs, the MAH is asked to inform if any of these SAEs led to discontinuation of the 
treatment and to discuss if the new data requires an update of the information provided in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. 
MAH’s response: Out of the 10 SAEs in CSR Table 5 describing ‘Injection related reaction’, ‘Infusion 
related reaction’, ‘Injection site pain’ and ‘Injection site reaction’, 3 were related to a different drug, 1 
led to temporary discontinuation and 6 led to permanent discontinuation of Kineret. 
In parallel with this procedure for the PAS study, the results of the anaSTILLs study (Sobi.ANAKIN-301) 
are  discussed  in  another  ongoing  procedure  EMA/H/C/000363/P46/031).  The  anaSTILLs  study  was  a 
placebo-controlled  study  in  12  patients  with  Still’s  disease  and  the  CSR  was  submitted  to  EMA  in 
November 2019 to meet the obligation of Article 46 since the study included pediatric patients. Based 
on the results from both this PAS study and the anaSTILLs study, the MAH plans to propose an updated 
text  for  the  SmPC  section  4.8  description  of  the  ‘Injection  site  reactions’.  The  updated  text  will  be 
submitted in a future variation later this year and will describe that in 12 patients with Still’s disease 
treated for 12 weeks in the placebo-controlled study, ISRs occurred in both treatment groups, of which 
all were mild in severity. No patients discontinued treatment due to ISRs. It will also describe that in the 
PAS  study,  a  non-interventional  long-term  safety  study  in  306  pediatric  patients  with  Still´s  disease 
followed for up to more than 9 years, ISRs of moderate or severe intensity had an incidence rate of 1.6 
per 100 patient years. 
CHMP comments  
The  MAH  informs  that  no information  regarding  Injection  site  reactions  will  be  added  to  the  SmPC 
during  this  present  procedure.  The  MAH  plans  to  submit  a  Type  II  variation  later  in  2020.  This 
application will include an update of section 4.8 in the SmPC with information regarding Injection site 
reactions. This should be accepted as a commitment from the MAH.  
Conclusion: Issue mostly resolved.  
The MAH should commit to submit a Type II variation application including an update of the 
SmPC with information regarding Injection site reactions (should be included in section 4.4 
of the SmPC).  
Question 13 (Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)): 
The MAH should consider updating section 4.8 of the SmPC with more information regarding MAS (cross-
reference to section 4.4 would be relevant). 
MAH’s response: relationship with Kineret has been established for MAS. The texts about MAS (and 
Malignancies) were moved from section 4.8 to section 4.4 in procedure EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0064/G 
and a Positive Opinion was received in March 2019. 
In the SmPC section 4.4 the MAH plans to add results from both this PAS study and from the anaSTILLs 
study  (Sobi.ANAKIN-301)  regarding  MAS,  to  be  submitted  in  a  future  variation  later  this  year.  The 
proposed  text  will  describe  that  no  events  of  MAS  were  reported  in  the  company-sponsored  clinical 
studies in Still’s disease, and that in the PAS study, a noninterventional long-term safety study in 306 
pediatric patients with Still's disease, there was no indication that the frequency of MAS increased during, 
or directly after, Kineret treatment. The proposed text will also state that the incidence rate of MAS in 
Assessment report

the PAS study was 2.4 events per 100 patient years, which is in line with what is expected for pediatric 
patients with Still's disease. 
CHMP comments  
The MAH informs that no information regarding MAS will be added to the SmPC during this present 
procedure. The MAH plans to submit a Type II variation later in 2020. This application will include an 
update of the SmPC with information regarding MAS. This should be accepted as a commitment from 
the MAH.  
Conclusion: Issue mostly resolved.  
The MAH should commit to submit a Type II variation application including an update of the 
SmPC with information regarding MAS (should be included in section 4.4 and/or section 4.8 
of the SmPC).

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Tresiba 
Insulin degludec 
On 20 March 2014, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Tresiba. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Novo Nordisk A/S. 
They may request a re-examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify the European 
Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication to include the combination of Tresiba with GLP-1 receptor 
agonists. This new indication is reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC as follows: 
"Use of Tresiba in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
When adding Tresiba to GLP-1 receptor agonists, the recommended daily starting dose is 10 units 
followed by individual dosage adjustments. 
When adding GLP-1 receptor agonists to Tresiba, it is recommended to reduce the dose of Tresiba by 
20% to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. Subsequently, dosage should be adjusted individually.” 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 
within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion.

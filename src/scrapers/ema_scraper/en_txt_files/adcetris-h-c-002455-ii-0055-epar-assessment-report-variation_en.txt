2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Disease or condition  
Hodgkins Lymphoma (HL) formerly known as Hodgkin’s disease accounts for approximately 10 percent 
of all lymphomas and is highly curable, with 80% of patients reaching complete remission. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The incidence in Europe is ~ 2.4 cases per 100.000 persons. Young adults aged 20–40 years are most 
often affected; a second incidence peak is seen in individuals aged 55 and older. HL is characterized 
histologically by malignant Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells that are surrounded by non-
malignant inflammatory cells. HL is divided in two major subtypes: classical (cHL) and nodular 
lymphocyte predominant (NLPHL), based on immunohistological features and microscopic appearance 
of the malignant cells. The cHL subtype expresses CD30, and accounts for 95% of all HL. There are 4 
histopathologic subtypes of cHL in the World Health Organization classification: nodular sclerosis, 
mixed cellularity, lymphocyte rich, and lymphocyte depleted.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis  
Clinical symptoms are present in 2/3 of patients, and could include the presence of B symptoms (fever, 
night sweats, unexplained weight loss >10% in 6 months), fatigue, pruritus and alcohol-induced pain. 
Staging is according to the Ann Arbor criteria, which are based on localisation, the extent of nodal and 
extranodal involvement and the presence of the classical B symptoms. For the purposes of treatment 
planning, cHL is frequently divided into early-stage (Stage I/II) and advanced-stage (Stage III/IV) 
disease. In the absence of unfavourable features, the prognosis for early-stage disease is excellent. 
Thus, the frontline treatment approach for these individuals is focused on minimizing toxicity of 
therapy while maintaining high cure rates.  
In addition to clinical staging, other clinical features can predict outcomes in these patients. The 
international prognostic score is a tool that assesses 7 potentially unfavourable clinical features in HL 
at diagnosis: serum albumin <4 g/dL, haemoglobin <10.5 g/dL, male gender, age >45 years, Stage IV 
disease, white blood cell count ≥15,000/μL, and absolute lymphocyte count <600/μL and/or <8% of 
the total white blood cell count. When applied retrospectively to patients who were treated with current 
standard-of-care combination chemotherapy regimens, the 5-year OS for patients with lower scores 
(0-3) was 93% ±1% and those with higher (≥4) scores was 78% ±4%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 7/121 
 
 
 
 
 
HL prognosis is worse in patients who present with advanced disease, and 30-40% relapse within 5 
years after initial treatment or have immediate treatment failure. Multiple large studies demonstrate 
that about half of patients undergoing ASCT can be cured. However, a significant percentage of 
patients with relapsed or refractory HL never make it to ASCT because their disease does not respond 
adequately to salvage therapies or their clinical status, including age, precludes them from undergoing 
the procedure. 
Management 
After diagnosis of HL, chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens are recommended, depending on the 
stage of the disease. According to the ESMO Clinical Practice guidelines (Eichenauer et al, 2018), the 
following therapeutic algorithm can be used.  
Figure 1 Therapeutic algorithm for newly diagnosed Hodgkin’s lymphoma. 
HL, Hodgkin’s lymphoma; RT, radiotherapy; ABVD, adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine; BEACOPPesc, bleomycin, 
etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone escalated dose regimen; ISRT, involved-site 
radiotherapy; PET, positron emission tomography; NLPHL, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin’s lymphoma; IFRT, involved-
field RT. 
Patients with early-stage disease are typically treated with 2 to 4 cycles of ABVD, with or without focal 
radiotherapy to sites of disease. This approach results in 3- to 5-year progression-free and OS rates 
exceeding 90% and 95%, respectively, in patients with favourable disease, and 85% and 90%, 
respectively, in patients with unfavourable disease.  
Patients diagnosed with Stage III/IV cHL are usually treated with 6 to 8 cycles of ABVD, with some 
physicians adding limited field consolidative radiotherapy for bulky mediastinal involvement. In 
multiple studies of Stage III/IV patients treated with ABVD, the 5-year failure free survival rates 
ranged from 61% to 67% and 5-year OS rates ranged from 73% to 85%. In patients ≤ 60 years who 
are eligible for a more intensive treatment, escalated-dose versions of BEACOPP (bleomycin, 
etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) could also be 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 8/121 
 
 
 
 
considered. Several trials randomly comparing ABVD and BEACOPP escalated have shown a superior 
tumour control with BEACOPP escalated, and a meta-analysis including 9993 patients also indicted a 
significantly better OS. However, given the relevant acute toxicity, appropriate surveillance and 
supportive care must be available. Moreover, the BEACOPP regimen should not be given in patients 
>60 years, as an increased treatment-related mortality has been observed in this age group. 
For most patients with refractory or relapsed HL after frontline therapy, the treatment of choice 
consists of high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT.
The use of brentuximab vedotin represents an 
option in patients relapsing after ASCT or at increased risk of relapse after ASCT. 
Furthermore, the patients who achieve durable remissions are still subject to late ASCT-related 
complications including secondary malignancies, cataracts, cardiac dysfunction, osteoporosis/avascular 
necrosis, hypothyroidism, and infertility. Therefore, to make substantial improvements to the 
outcomes in advanced cHL, more effective frontline treatments with manageable toxicity profiles need 
to be developed.  
About the product 
Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin; SGN35) is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), that 
consists of the chimeric anti-human CD30 monoclonal antibody (cAC10) conjugated to the small 
molecule cytotoxic anti-tubulin agent MMAE by a protease-cleavable linker. CD30 is a member of the 
tumour-necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Mechanistically, the antibody targeted chemotherapeutic 
brentuximab vedotin acts by binding to the cell surface marker CD30, expressed on cells of several 
types of malignancy, including HL. After binding to CD30 positive cells, brentuximab vedotin is 
internalized, and MMAE is released from the conjugate through proteolytic degradation of the drug 
linker. Released MMAE binds to the tubulin and leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest and cell death. CD30 
expression on normal cells is rare, i.e. less than 1% of lymphoid cells, being activated, but not resting 
lymphocytes (T, B and NK cells) and weakly on activated monocytes. CD30 is not present on cells from 
solid organs. 
Adcetris was granted a MA in the EU in October 2012 and is currently indicated for: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ HL at increased risk of relapse or progression 
following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) (see section 5.1). 
the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma (HL):  
1. 
following ASCT, or 
2. 
following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a 
treatment option. 
the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma (sALCL). 
the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after at least 1 
prior systemic therapy (see section 5.1). 
The additional HL indication initially proposed for Adcetris through this variation procedure was: “the 
frontline treatment of adult patients with CD30+ advanced HL in combination with chemotherapy”. 
The indication was finally revised to “Adcetris is indicated for adult patients with previously untreated 
CD30+ Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine 
(AVD).” 
Brentuximab vedotin is formulated for intravenous administration as a 50 mg powder for concentrate 
for solution for infusion. The recommended dose in combination with chemotherapy (doxorubicin [A], 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 9/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vinblastine [V] and dacarbazine [D] [AVD]) is 1.2 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 
30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. 
Primary prophylaxis with growth factor support (G-CSF) is recommended for all patients with 
previously untreated HL receiving combination therapy beginning with the first dose. 
Refer to the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) of chemotherapy agents given in combination 
with ADCETRIS for patients with previously untreated HL. (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1)  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
The most recent ERA included the current three indications in calculations for environmental exposure. 
As long as the extension of indication variation does not increase the potential population treated 
beyond these indications, there is no need for a revised ERA. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

This section only summarizes additional findings from the Phase 3 study C25003 (ECHELON-1). 
Unlike all previous studies for brentuximab vedotin, ECHELON-1 used the drug in combination, at a 
lower starting dose, and with a more frequent dosing schedule. This 1.2 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin 
combination starting dose given on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle was chosen to yield exposures 
similar to the 1.8 mg/kg monotherapy starting dose given once every 3 weeks. 
Relevant pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) secondary and exploratory objectives of 
the ECHELON-1 study included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To describe the PK of the brentuximab vedotin antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), its monomethyl 
auristatin E toxin (MMAE), and total antibody (TAb) in blood. 
To determine the immunogenicity of brentuximab vedotin. 
To assess any impact of brentuximab vedotin dosing on serum concentrations of doxorubicin, 
vinblastine, and/or dacarbazine (AVD). 
To assess changes in tumour biomarker expression before and after treatment. 
Additionally, population PK (popPK) analyses were conducted in adult patients to build predictive 
popPK models for the ADC and MMAE. 
Sparse PK sampling was performed for all Safety Population patients, with intensive PK sampling (iPK) 
to be performed for a total of 100 patients, 50 patients on each treatment arm, of whom at least 20 
patients on each treatment arm were to be Asian.  
Bioanalysis for ADC, its MMAE, TAb, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and/or dacarbazine was conducted using 
validated assays.  
PK Parameters for Brentuximab Vedotin ADC 
The PK of the brentuximab vedotin ADC was determined from serum collected from the blood samples 
of patients who met the study’s inclusion criteria, received brentuximab vedotin, and provided 
evaluable PK data. ADC PK data are presented for 661 patients (100%) in the A+AVD treatment arm, 
including a 59-patient intensive PK (iPK) sampling subset, and for 59 patients in the ABVD arm to 
permit comparisons (for AVD components). 
Among 59 the iPK patients in the A+AVD arm, 4 patients from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) and 7 patients 
from Cycle 3 Day 1 (C3D1) were excluded from the ADC PK analysis using the non-compartmental 
analysis (NCA) approach because of insufficient concentration data or missing end of infusion (EOI) 
concentrations. One additional implausible predose ADC concentration on C1D1 was excluded. 
Serum concentration-time profiles following IV infusion administration of 1.2 mg/kg brentuximab 
vedotin twice weekly (Q2W) are shown in Figure 2, and PK parameters are summarised in Table 2. 
Peak serum ADC concentrations occurred at the sampling time point close to the EOI (within 1 hour 
post EOI) for both C1D1 and C3D1. The geometric mean serum ADC maximum concentration (Cmax) 
was 22.9 μg/mL and 23.6 μg/mL for C1D1 and C3D1, respectively. The geometric mean concentration 
at the end of infusion (Ceoi) was comparable to Cmax. After attaining Cmax, serum ADC

concentrations declined in a multi-exponential manner with a geometric mean terminal disposition 
phase half-life (t 1/2z) of 3.70 days on C1D1 and 5.00 days on C3D1. Geometric mean area under the 
concentration-time curve from time 0 to 14 days (AUC14D) was 43.2 day*μg/mL on C1D1 and 56.1 
day*μg/mL on C3D1, with an accumulation ratio of 1.27.

Interpatient variability as assessed by % coefficient of variance (CV) of serum ADC exposure in Cmax 
and the AUC14D was approximately 28.1% and 28.9%, respectively, on C1D1 and 27.8% and 23.8%, 
respectively, on C3D1. The steady-state geometric mean trough concentration for the ADC was 1.18 
μg/mL, as observed on Cycle 6 Day 15 (Figure 3).

PK Parameters for Total Anti-CD30 Antibody 
The PK of the bound and free anti-CD30 antibody (total antibody, TAb) was determined from serum 
collected from the blood samples of patients who met the study’s inclusion criteria, received 
brentuximab vedotin, and provided evaluable PK data.  
Among 59 iPK patients in the A+AVD arm, 4 patients from C1D1 and 7 patients from C3D1 were 
excluded from the TAb PK analysis using the non-compartmental analysis (NCA) approach because of 
insufficient concentration data or missing end of infusion concentrations. Two additional implausible 
predose TAb concentrations on C1D1 were excluded. 
Serum concentration-time profiles following IV infusion administration of 1.2 mg/kg brentuximab 
vedotin Q2W are shown in Figure 4, and PK parameters are summarised in Table 4. Peak serum TAb 
concentrations occurred at the sampling time point close to the EOI (within 1 hour post EOI) for both 
C1D1 and C3D1. Geometric mean serum TAb Cmax was 22.6 μg/mL and 26.4 μg/mL for C1D1 and 
C3D1, respectively. Geometric mean Ceoi was comparable to Cmax. After attaining Cmax, serum Tab 
concentrations declined in a multi-exponential manner with a geometric mean t 1/2z of 4.30 days on 
C1D1 and 5.35 days for C3D1. Geometric mean AUC14D was 80.7 day*μg/mL on C1D1 and 112 
day*μg/mL on C3D1, with an accumulation ratio of 1.36.

PK Parameters for Monomethyl Auristatin E 
The PK of unconjugated drug (MMAE) was determined from plasma collected from the blood samples of 
patients who met the study’s inclusion criteria, received brentuximab vedotin, and provided evaluable 
PK data. 
Among 59 iPK patients in the A+AVD arm, 3 patients from C3D1 were excluded from the MMAE PK 
analysis using the NCA approach because of insufficient concentration data or missing end of infusion 
concentrations. One additional implausible predose MMAE concentration on C1D1 was excluded.  
Plasma concentration-time profiles following IV infusion administration of 1.2 mg/kg brentuximab 
vedotin Q2W are shown in Figure 6, and PK parameters are summarised in Table 5. Median peak 
plasma MMAE concentrations occurred approximately 2 days post EOI for both C1D1 and C3D1. 
Geometric mean plasma MMAE Cmax was 3.20 ng/mL and 1.36 ng/mL for C1D1 and C3D1, 
respectively. After attaining Cmax, plasma MMAE concentrations declined in a nearly log-linear manner 
with a geometric mean t 1/2z of 3.11 days on C1D1 and 3.92 days on C3D1. Geometric mean AUC14D 
was 18.8 day*ng/mL on C1D1 and 9.46 day*ng/mL on C3D1, with an approximately 50% decrease of 
MMAE exposure following Q2W dosing of brentuximab vedotin.

PK Results for Brentuximab Vedotin as Single Agent (Study C25005) Compared With 
Combination Therapy (Study C25003)  
Study C25005 (Single-Agent Brentuximab Vedotin) was a multicenter, open-label, 1:1, randomized, 2-
arm study of brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg, IV Q3W) with (Arm B) and without (Arm A) 
concomitant rifampicin. The study evaluated the PK of brentuximab vedotin, MMAE, and 5 MMAE 
metabolites with and without rifampicin, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 inducer that could potentially 
enhance metabolism of free (unconjugated) MMAE. For comparison of the brentuximab vedotin PK 
results when dosed in combination with AVD, only the PK results from the single-agent treatment (Arm 
A) from Study C25005 are presented herein. This study was previously submitted as part of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002455/II/0033. 
For comparison between studies, concentration data for C1D1 on Study C25005 were dose-normalized 
to an equivalent dose of 1.2 mg/kg for comparison with C1D1 data from Study C25003 in which 1.2 
mg/kg was administered.  
When administered as either a single agent (1.8 mg/kg 3QW) in Study C25005 or in combination 
therapy (1.2 mg/kg Q2W) in Study C25003, there were no readily apparent differences observed in the 
brentuximab vedotin PK profiles on C1D1 for ADC (Figure 8), TAb (Figure 9), and MMAE (Figure 10) 
when adjusted for differences in the dose administered between the 2 studies. The Cmax for ADC, 
TAb, and MMAE from Study C25005 were very similar to that reported in Study 25003 (when adjusted 
for dose differences).

PK Parameters for Doxorubicin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine 
The PK of doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine was determined from the blood samples of iPK 
patients (59 iPK patients per treatment arm) who met the study’s inclusion criteria, received A+AVD or 
ABVD, and provided evaluable PK data. Two to 16 patients had insufficient concentration data or 
missing end-of-infusion concentrations so were excluded from non-compartmental analyses of Cycle 1 
Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1, and 4 to 25 implausible concentrations from these time points were 
excluded. 
Doxorubicin 
Following IV infusion of 25 mg/m2 doxorubicin Q2W, peak plasma doxorubicin concentrations occurred 
at a median time point close to the EOI for both treatment arms on C1D1 and C3D1, followed by multi-
exponential decline. Doxorubicin AUC24h was similar between the 2 arms, with a geometric mean 
AUC24h ratio of 0.968 (90% CI, 0.832, 1.13) for C1D1 and 0.995 (90% CI, 0.799, 1.24) for C3D1. 
Similarly, doxorubicin Cmax was comparable between the 2 arms, with a geometric mean Cmax ratio 
(A+AVD vs ABVD) of 0.958 (90% CI, 0.704, 1.30) for C1D1 and 0.993 (90% CI, 0.677, 1.46) for 
C3D1.  
PK variability as assessed by % CV of plasma doxorubicin exposure ranged from 78.2% to 109% for 
Cmax and 50.1% to 123% for AUC24h on C1D1 and C3D1 in both the A+AVD and ABVD arms. 
Geometric mean doxorubicin Ceoi and AUC∞ were close to Cmax and AUC24h, respectively. 
Vinblastine 
Following IV infusion of 6 mg/m2 vinblastine Q2W, median peak plasma vinblastine concentrations 
occurred at a median time point close to the EOI for both treatment arms on C1D1 and C3D1, followed 
by multi-exponential decline. Vinblastine AUC24h was similar between the 2 arms, with a geometric 
mean AUC24h ratio of 1.12 (90% CI, 0.951, 1.32) for C1D1 and 1.03 (90% CI, 0.799, 1.34) for C3D1. 
Similarly, vinblastine Cmax was comparable between the 2 arms, with a geometric mean Cmax ratio 
(A+AVD vs ABVD) of 1.04 (90% CI, 0.726, 1.49) for C1D1 and 1.07 (90% CI, 0.617, 1.87) for C3D1. 
PK variability as assessed by % CV of plasma vinblastine exposure ranged from 113% to 193% for 
Cmax and 50.7% to 165% for AUC24h on C1D1 and C3D1 for both A+AVD and AVBD arms. Geometric 
mean vinblastine Ceoi and AUC∞ were comparable to Cmax and AUC24h, respectively.  
Dacarbazine 
Following IV infusion administration of 375 mg/m2 dacarbazine Q2W, median peak plasma dacarbazine 
concentrations occurred at a median time point close to the EOI for both treatment arms on C1D1 and 
C3D1, followed by nearly log-linear decline. Dacarbazine AUC24h was similar between the 2 arms, with 
a geometric mean AUC24h ratio of 1.10 (90% CI, 0.923, 1.30) for C1D1 and 0.993 (90% CI, 0.842, 
1.17) for C3D1. Similarly, dacarbazine Cmax was comparable between the 2 arms, with a geometric 
mean Cmax ratio (A+AVD vs ABVD) of 0.891 (90% CI, 0.694, 1.14) for C1D1 and 0.933 (90% CI, 
0.767, 1.13) for C3D1. PK variability as assessed by %CV of plasma dacarbazine exposure ranged 
from 36.4% to 102% for Cmax and 44.2% to 61.7% for AUC24h in C1D1 and C3D1 of both A+AVD 
and AVBD arms. Geometric mean dacarbazine Ceoi and AUC∞ were comparable with the Cmax and 
AUC24h, respectively.

Population Pharmacokinetics  
The overall objectives of the population PK analyses were: 
1. To build 2 predictive PK models that describe the concentration-time data of ADC and MMAE in 
patients with cHL in ECHELON-1. 
2. To identify and characterize the impact of various intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors (covariates) 
which influence the PK and PK variability of ADC and MMAE. 
3. To estimate the magnitude of unexplained variability in the PK in patients. 
4. To evaluate the model performance of the 2 population PK models. 
5. To use these models to summarize the systemic exposures of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE 
estimated in patients with cHL in ECHELON-1. 
Two popPK models were developed for this analysis, 1 each for ADC and MMAE. The models were 
based on a previously developed model for the ALCANZA study (Study C25001) and were built with 
data from 661 patients with HL from the ECHELON-1 (C25003) study. 
The POP PK models for ADC and MMAE were based on the previously reported models and were 
developed in steps; a base model which included structural components of the model was used to 
conduct a graphical evaluation of the covariates. Covariates that showed a graphical trend or required 
further evaluation based on physiological relevance or observation during previous clinical trials of BV 
were tested as single covariate models (p<0.01). A full model including all of the statistically relevant 
pre- specified covariate effects of interest was then developed. A final model was chosen by retaining 
only the statistically significant covariate effects (p<0.001). The magnitude of the impact of the 
covariates was also considered, if the magnitude of the impact was small (less than a 20% change 
over the range of covariate values in the database) or the covariate effect was poorly estimated [e.g., 
standard error (SE) > 45%] then the covariate may be re-parameterized or discarded. The parameters 
in the population models were estimated using the NONMEM software program (versions 7.3). The 
first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) method was used for estimation. A visual predictive check 
(VPC) was conducted. 
Baseline demographic and characteristics data of the patients from Study C25003 included in the 
PopPK model are summarised in Table 6 and Table 7.

Brentuximab Vedotin ADC Model Results 
PK samples were collected from all patients, including a subset of 59 patients who underwent iPK 
sampling. 
The model for ADC was a linear, 3-compartment model with zero-order input and first-order 
elimination. The final ADC model included effects of albumin and Body Surface Area (BSA) on 
clearance, BSA and sex on central volume of distribution, and BSA on peripheral volume 2. Other 
factors, including age, weight, race, antitherapeutic antibodies (ATA) response, ATA titer, nATA 
response and International Prognostic Factors Project (IPFP) risk factor were not retained as 
statistically significant covariates in the model.  
Table 8. ADC Final PK Model Parameters 
The final PK model for ADC was used to simulate the concentrations produced after a 1.2 mg/kg dose 
of brentuximab vedotin every 14 days for 5 doses (Cycle 3). All the patients in the dataset were 
included and their baseline covariate values were used. The doses were capped at 120 mg for patients 
weighing more than 100 kg, consistent with the dosing strategy used in ECHELON-1. A Monte Carlo 
simulation approach was used, whereby 150 replicate simulations were performed. Figure 14 is a plot 
of the ADC 90% prediction interval (black lines with shaded grey area) and median (red line) simulated 
concentrations. This plot shows some accumulation of ADC with this dosing regimen, in line with the 
accumulation observed with non-compartmental analysis (NCA).

With increasing BSA, parameters for ADC clearance (1.10), central volume of distribution (0.893), and 
volume of distribution 2 (1.47) are predicted to increase by Cycle 3, which results in an increase in 
AUC14D. The impact of the model estimate of the covariate effects of these parameters on exposure 
was evaluated by simulating the relationship between BSA/body weight and AUC14D. Consistent with 
the dosing strategy used in ECHELON-1, doses were capped at 120 mg for patients weighing more 
than 100 kg. The simulations for BSA/body weight and AUC14D included the 100 kg dose cap (Figure 
15). These simulations demonstrate an increase in AUC with higher BSA/body weight that is 
attenuated by the 100 kg dose cap. Based on the geometric mean AUC, there is an approximately 30% 
lower AUC for patients weighing less than 61 kg (48.8 μg*day/mL) compared with patients weighing 
between 88 kg and 100 kg (63.6 μg*day/mL).

The model estimate of the covariate effect of sex on the central volume was 0.934, which indicates an 
approximate 7% reduction in central volume in female patients relative to that of male patients. The 
individual model post-hoc clearance parameter estimates (at baseline) for females and males were 
plotted and indicate significant overlap between the sexes; although the central tendency indicates 
women had approximately 20% lower central volume than men. This is attributed to the tendency for 
women to have lower body weight than men, and the combined covariate impact of sex and BSA on 
central volume. This was further explored by a Monte Carlo simulation that included body weight or 
BSA stratification. These simulations show that, after accounting for body size differences, the central 
volume for females is predicted to be 10% to 14% lower than that of males 
MMAE Model Results 
The model structure for MMAE is characterized as a linear, 2-compartment model with formation from 
a lag compartment driven by parallel processes from the ADC central compartment and an internalized 
ADC compartment.  
The fraction of MMAE formed directly from ADC decreased after ADC administration, relative to time 
after dose, and was used to empirically describe the time-dependent PK of MMAE. This model was 
developed sequentially to the ADC model, whereby the ADC model individual post-hoc parameter 
estimates were used to drive the input to the MMAE model. The final MMAE model is depicted in Table 
9. 
Table 9. MMAE Final PK Model Parameters 
The final MMAE model included effects of BSA, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and albumin 
concentration on clearance. Other factors, including age, race, ATA response, ATA titer, nATA 
response, and IPFP risk factors, were not retained as statistically significant covariates in the model.  
The final PK model for MMAE was used to simulate the concentrations produced after a 1.2 mg/kg dose 
of brentuximab vedotin every 14 days for 5 doses (Cycle 3). Doses were capped at 120 mg for patients 
weighing more than 100 kg, consistent with the dosing strategy used in ECHELON-1. All the patients in 
the dataset were included and their baseline covariate values were used. A Monte Carlo simulation 
approach was used, whereby 150 replicate simulations were performed. Figure 16 is a plot of the

MMAE 90% prediction interval (black lines with shaded grey area) and median (red line) simulated 
concentrations. This simulation indicated that MMAE AUC and Cmax decreased by approximately 49% 
and 57%, respectively, between the first and fifth doses, which was consistent with the results 
observed by NCA. 
Figure 13. Simulated MMAE Concentration-Time Profile Following 1.2 mg/kg 
Brentuximab Vedotin Q2W 
The model estimates of the covariate effects on brentuximab vedotin predict a narrow range of MMAE 
clearance values across albumin concentrations (1.42 L/hr at the low range to 1.46 L/hr at the high 
range). The covariate effects of the model predict that, with increasing BSA, MMAE clearance increases 
approximately proportionally, and AUC increases slightly, although these increases were attenuated by 
inclusion of the 100-kg dose cap. Based on the geometric mean AUC, there is an approximate 13% 
lower AUC for patients weighing less than 61 kg (10.0 ng*day/mL) compared with patients that weigh 
between 88 kg and 100 kg (11.3 ng*day/mL).  
The model predicts that MMAE clearance increases with increasing GFR. Based on the geometric mean 
AUC, patients with a GFR <44 mL/min (13.9 ng*day/mL) had an increase in AUC that was 
approximately 23% higher than for patients with a GFR >90 mL/min (11.3 ng*day/mL). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
 Biomarker analysis 
Baseline CD30 expression (Study C25003) 
CD30 assessment was done by immunohistochemistry and the positivity was determined if CD30 
staining was ≥20% on evaluable total lymphocytes. Baseline CD30 expression status in each arm was 
summarized. 
CD30 positivity, when CD30 assessment was available, was comparable between the 2 treatment arms 
(n=527/528 in the A+AVD arm and n=493/497 in the ABVD arm). CD30 negativity was found in <1% 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019

of patients on both treatment arms. Most of the failures during CD30 assessment (20% in A+AVD arm 
and 26% in the ABVD arm) were due to poor specimen quality and/or specimen mishandling. Median 
% positive CD30 staining was comparable between the 2 treatment arms (98% in A+AVD arm and 
99% in ABVD arm). 
Soluble CD30 concentrations 
Soluble CD30 (sCD30) concentration was measured in the serum of patients in both treatment arms at 
baseline, before administration of study drug on Day 1 of Cycle 2 through Cycle 6, and at EOT.  
Mean levels of soluble CD30 at Baseline were highly variable among patients; median levels of soluble 
CD30 were comparable between the 2 treatment arms at Baseline (207 ng/mL in the A+AVD arm and 
209 ng/mL in the ABVD arm). 
After brentuximab vedotin treatment, median levels of sCD30 exhibited a trend to be increased at 
Cycles 2 through 6 in the A+AVD arm relative to the baseline median values (median increase from 
baseline ranged from 39.3 to 59.6 ng/mL). In the ABVD arm, sCD30 levels exhibited a trend to be 
decreased at Cycles 2 through 6 relative to the baseline values (median decrease from baseline ranged 
from 109 to 128 ng/mL).  
No consistent changes in mean or median absolute concentrations of sCD30 were observed over time.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The population PK model discussed in Section 2.3.2was used to derive an exposure metric for 
individual patients in ECHELON-1 for brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE to examine E-R 
relationships. Only data from ECHELON-1 were used in this evaluation. 
The objectives of this population E-R analysis were: 
• 
• 
To assess relationships between time-averaged ADC exposure (AUC/Time) and mPFS as evaluated 
by an independent review facility (IRF). 
To assess relationships between AUC/Time of ADC and MMAE and the following AEs: 
– Grade 4 or higher neutropenia (NEU4). 
– Febrile neutropenia (FN). 
– Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy (PN2). 
– Any Grade 3 or higher TEAE (TEAE3). 
Exposure-Efficacy Analysis Results 
Evaluation of mPFS as a Function of ADC AUC/Time 
An assessment of the covariates that could be potentially influential for mPFS was made to ensure 
these factors were balanced across quartiles of ADC exposure. The covariates factors (region, 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 25/121 
 
 
 
 
extranodal involvement, G-CSF primary prophylaxis, baseline ECOG performance status, and baseline 
CD30) appeared evenly balanced across all ADC AUC/Time quartiles, whereas International Prognostic 
Factors Project (IPFP) score suggested some imbalance in the data across ADC AUC/Time quartile. 
Figure 17 shows Kaplan-Meier curves for mPFS per IRF. The ADC AUC/Time values were grouped by 
quartiles and a separate curve for the ABVD arm is provided as reference. There was a large degree of 
overlap among the 4 AUC/Time bins (log-rank test p=0.86). Visually, on average, patients treated with 
brentuximab vedotin had longer mPFS times across all quartiles of exposure compared with patients in 
the ABVD arm. 
Figure 14. Kaplan-Meier Curves for mPFS by Quartiles of the ADC AUC/Time With 
ABVD Overlaid 
A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed on mPFS and AUC/Time as a continuous 
predictor. The proportional hazards regression model was stratified by region and IPFP score, with 
AUC/Time included as a continuous variable. The ABVD arm was not included. ADC AUC/Time as a 
continuous variable was not a significant predictor of mPFS (p=0.70105), suggesting that there was a 
consistent treatment benefit across the range of exposures achieved (HR=1.00; 95% CI=0.987, 1.02). 
The parameters for Cox regression are presented in Table 10.

Additional Subgroup Analyses for mPFS were performed for 2 subgroups (patients with extranodal 
involvement and categorized by disease stage). Kaplan-Meier curves for mPFS per IRF were plotted by 
ADC AUC/Time quartile. A separate curve for the ABVD arm was overlaid on the same plot as a 
reference. In addition, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was also performed for the same 
subgroups. Analyses for the results for the subgroup of patients with stage IV disease or with 
extranodal involvement indicated that also in these situations ADC AUC/Time was not a statistically 
significant predictor of mPFS as a continuous covariate for patients. 
Exposure-AE Analyses Results 
Peripheral Neuropathy Grade ≥2 as a Function of Time Averaged ADC AUC/Time 
A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess whether AUC/Time was predictive of a Grade ≥2 
peripheral neuropathy. The addition of a parameter to the model based on ADC AUC/Time resulted in a 
likelihood ratio of 8.337 with 1 additional parameter, an additional degree of freedom (DF), which 
corresponds to a p-value <0.01, which was statistically significant. The parameters for the final logistic 
regression function are provided in Table 11.

Neuropathy as a Function of ADC AUC/Time 
Figure 18 presents the model results. The observed values of ADC AUC/Time are shown by the dots for 
patients who did (P=1) and did not (P=0) experience Grade ≥2 PN. Increasing ADC AUC/Time resulted 
in greater probability of Grade ≥2 PN.

A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess whether MMAE AUC/Time at the worst event 
was predictive of a patient experiencing a Grade ≥2 PN event. The addition of a parameter to the 
model based on MMAE AUC/Time resulted in a 1.643 likelihood ratio with 1 additional parameter (1 
additional DF), which corresponds to p=0.1999, which was not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. 
This indicated that MMAE AUC/Time was not predictive of the probability of experiencing a Grade ≥2 
PN event. A summary of the coefficients in the model are shown in Table 12. MMAE AUC/Time was not 
identified as being predictive of Grade ≥2 PN.

Grade ≥4 Neutropenia as a Function of Time Average ADC AUC/Time 
A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess whether ADC AUC/Time was predictive of a 
patient experiencing Grade ≥4 neutropenia. G-CSF primary prophylaxis was also included in the

Grade ≥4 Neutropenia as a Function of Time-Averaged MMAE AUC/Time 
A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess whether MMAE AUC/Time was predictive of a 
patient experiencing Grade ≥4 neutropenia. Because administration of G-CSF can reduce the likelihood 
of neutropenia, G-CSF primary prophylaxis was also included in the model. The addition of a parameter 
to the model based on MMAE AUC/Time was considered statistically significant (p<0.05). The 
parameters for the final logistic regression function are provided in Table 14.

Febrile Neutropenia as a Function of Time Averaged ADC AUC/Time 
A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess whether AUC/Time was predictive of a patient 
experiencing febrile neutropenia. G-CSF primary prophylaxis was also included in the model. The 
addition of a parameter to the model based on ADC AUC/Time resulted in a likelihood ratio of 10.1 with 
1 additional parameter (1 additional DF), which corresponds to a p<0.01, which is considered 
statistically significant. The addition of G-CSF primary prophylaxis resulted in a likelihood ratio of 5.577 
(p<0.05), which is statistically significant. The parameters for the final logistic regression function are 
provided in Table 15.

Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Grade ≥3 as a Function of Time Averaged ADC AUC/Time 
A logistic regression analysis was performed on Grade ≥3 TEAEs and ADC AUC/Time at the time of 
TEAE of highest severity. For patients who did not experience a Grade ≥3 TEAE, AUC/Time was 
calculated over the treatment duration. Because TEAEs also captured neutropenia, G-CSF primary 
prophylaxis was included as a covariate. The addition of a parameter to the model based on ADC 
AUC/Time was not statistically significant (p>0.05). However, G-CSF primary prophylaxis had a 
likelihood ratio of 36.71 with an associated p<0.01. The parameters for this logistic regression 
evaluation are presented in Table 17.

A logistic regression analysis was performed on Grade ≥3 TEAE and MMAE AUC/Time at the time of the

reduce the likelihood of neutropenia, G-CSF primary prophylaxis was included as a covariate. The 
addition of a parameter to the model based on MMAE AUC/Time resulted in a likelihood of 5.829 with 1 
additional parameter (1 additional DF) (p<0.05.) The addition of G-CSF primary prophylaxis resulted in

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology characteristics of brentuximab vedotin as monotherapy was already 
assessed as part of the initial marketing authorisation application. In this variation, additional data 
were provided on the clinical pharmacology of brentuximab vedotin in combination with doxorubicin, 
vinblastine, and/or dacarbazine (AVD), in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). 
The pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin in combination with AVD were evaluated in a single 
phase 3 study in 661 patients. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the 
pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin in combination with AVD were consistent to that in 
monotherapy.  
After multiple-dose, IV infusion of 1.2 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin every two weeks, maximal serum 
concentrations of ADC were observed near the end of the infusion and elimination exhibited a 
multi-exponential decline with a t 1/2z of approximately 4 to 5 days. Maximal plasma concentrations of 
MMAE were observed approximately 2 days after the end of infusion, and exhibited a 
mono-exponential decline with a t 1/2z of approximately 3 to 4 days. 
After multiple-dose, IV infusion of 1.2 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin every two weeks, steady-state 
trough concentrations of ADC and MMAE were achieved by Cycle 3. Once steady-state was achieved, 
the PK of ADC did not appear to change with time. ADC accumulation (as assessed by AUC14D between 
Cycle 1 and Cycle 3) was 1.27-fold. The exposure of MMAE (as assessed by AUC14D between Cycle 1 
and Cycle 3) appeared to decrease with time by approximately 50% (see SmPC section 5.2). 
As measured by Cmax, AUC24h, Ceoi, and AUCinf, no apparent differences were observed in the PK of 
each component of AVD between the 2 treatment arms (A-AVD vs doxorubicin (Adriamycin), 
bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). Co-administration of brentuximab vedotin did not 
affect the plasma exposure of doxorubicin, vinblastine, or dacarbazine as compared to the situation 
when given in a ABVD regimen. Doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine were analysed using 
sufficiently validated assays.  
Two popPK models were developed for this analysis, 1 each for ADC and MMAE. The models were 
based on a previously developed model for the ALCANZA study (Study C25001) and were built with 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 34/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data from 661 patients with HL from the ECHELON-1 (C25003) study. Based on pop-PK simulations, 
ADC AUC increased with increasing body size, although this increase was attenuated with the 100-kg 
dose cap. Likewise, MMAE CL increased with increasing body size. With body weight-based dosing and 
the 100-kg dose cap, only small changes in MMAE AUC were observed across body sizes. The increases 
are unlikely to be clinically meaningful given the significant overlap in exposure between the body size 
ranges. 
Further, the pop-PK model predicts that, with increasing albumin concentration, ADC clearance 
decreases and AUC slightly increases. Based on the geometric mean AUC, the AUC for patients with 
albumin concentrations < 37 g/L (49.5 μg*day/mL) is approximately 20% lower than for patients with 
albumin concentrations ≥43 g/L (59.6 μg*day/mL). The covariate effects of the model predict that, 
with increasing BSA, MMAE clearance increases approximately proportionally, and AUC increases 
slightly, although these increases were attenuated by inclusion of the 100-kg dose cap. Based on the 
geometric mean AUC, there is an approximate 13% lower AUC for patients weighing less than 61 kg 
(10.0 ng*day/mL) compared with patients that weigh between 88 kg and 100 kg (11.3 ng*day/mL). 
These differences are unlikely to be clinically meaningful given the significant overlap in exposure 
across the albumin concentration ranges. 
Simulations for ADC show that, after accounting for body size differences, the central volume for 
females is predicted to be 10% to 14% lower than that of males. These differences are unlikely to be 
clinically meaningful given the overall variability in ADC PK. The influence of age, race (Asian and non-
Asian), ATA (nATA and ATA titer), and IPFP score were not identified as significant covariates 
impacting the PK of ADC or MMAE. No dosing adjustment based on these intrinsic or extrinsic patient 
factors evaluated is recommended for brentuximab vedotin in adult patients. The model predicts that 
MMAE clearance increases with increasing GFR. Based on the geometric mean AUC, patients with a 
GFR <44 mL/min (13.9 ng*day/mL) had an increase in AUC that was approximately 23% higher than 
for patients with a GFR >90 mL/min (11.3 ng*day/mL). However, given the substantial overlap in 
exposures across the range of GFRs, these differences are not expected to be clinically meaningful.  
Overall, the results of this analysis showed that the PK models for ADC and MMAE adequately describe 
their concentration-versus-time profiles. 
With regards to elderly, the population pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin in combination with 
AVD were examined including data from 661 patients up to 82 years old (42 patients ≥65-<75 and 17 
patients ≥75 years of age). The influence of age on pharmacokinetics was investigated in each analysis 
and it was not a significant covariate (see SmPC section 5.2). The dosing recommendations for 
patients aged 65 and older are the same as for adults (see section 4.2). 
There is no clinical trial experience using brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy in 
patients with renal impairment, where serum creatinine is ≥ 2.0 mg/dL and/or creatinine clearance or 
calculated creatinine clearance is ≤ 40 mL/minute. Use of brentuximab vedotin in combination with 
chemotherapy should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment. Patients with renal 
impairment should be closely monitored for adverse events. 
There is no clinical trial experience using brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy in 
patients with hepatic impairment, where total bilirubin is > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
(unless due to Gilbert syndrome), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) are > 3 times the ULN, or > 5 times the ULN if their elevation may be reasonably ascribed to the 
presence of HL in the liver. Use of brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy should be 
avoided in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The recommended starting dose in 
patients with mild hepatic impairment is 0.9 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 35/121 
 
 
 
30 minutes every 3 weeks. Patients with hepatic impairment should be closely monitored for adverse 
events. 
In terms of pharmacodynamics no statistically significant correlations between sCD30 or other 
biomarkers and disease pathway/drug mechanism have been described. 
For patients experiencing treatment-related toxicities upon treatment at the starting dose, protocol-
specified dose reductions for brentuximab vedotin are recommended as supported by exposure-safety 
analyses that revealed relationships between ADC and/or MMAE exposure and the incidence of all 
evaluated AE outcomes of clinical interest (Grade ≥2 PN, Grade ≥4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, 
and Grade ≥3 TEAE). G-CSF primary prophylaxis reduced the occurrence of neutropenia, febrile 
neutropenia, and Grade ≥3 TEAE (as these are mostly neutropenia-related). 
Collectively, these results support the findings that the safety profile of brentuximab vedotin can be 
adequately managed by the dose modification/dose reduction for neuropathy and G-CSF primary 
prophylaxis for neutropenia(-related) AEs, as established in ECHELON-1. 
Regarding neuropathy, in the case of grade 2 the dose should be reduced to 0.9 mg/kg up to a 
maximum of 90 mg every 2 weeks; if grade 3 neuropathy develops treatment with ADCETRIS should 
be withheld until toxicity is ≤ Grade 2, then treatment can be restarted at a reduced dose to 
0.9 mg/kg every 2 weeks; in case of a grade IV neuropathy treatment should be discontinued. 
In patients who develop Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia, G-CSF or GM-CSF should be considered in 
subsequent cycles. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall it is concluded that the clinical pharmacology has been adequately investigated. Relevant 
dosing recommendations and warnings have been included in the SmPC sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Dose escalation Study SGN35-009 
This Phase 1 dose escalation study investigated the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
brentuximab vedotin in combination with a standard of care multi-chemotherapy ABVD (n=25) or in 
combination with a modified standard of care therapy AVD (n=26). Adult (18-60 years) treatment–
naïve HL patients with histologically confirmed Stage IIa bulky disease or Stage IIb-IV disease were 
eligible for this study.  
The tested dose levels of brentuximab vedotin in combination with ABVD were 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 mg/kg 
and the planned dose level of brentuximab vedotin in combination with AVD was 1.2 mg/kg.  
No protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed with doses of brentuximab vedotin 
up to 1.2 mg/kg every 2 weeks (the maximum planned dose). However, unacceptable pulmonary 
toxicity (44%, including 2 fatal events) was noted in patients treated with brentuximab vedotin plus 
ABVD. In contrast, no pulmonary toxicity was observed in patients treated with brentuximab vedotin 
plus AVD. Furthermore, 24 of 25 (96%) response evaluable patients treated with brentuximab vedotin 
plus AVD achieved a complete response at the end of frontline therapy and the 5-year failure-free 
survival for this cohort was 92%.

Safety signal 
In the brentuximab vedotin with ABVD regimen, 11 of 25 patients (44%) experienced an AE associated 
with pulmonary toxicity; events resolved in 9 of 11 patient. One event of pulmonary toxicity was Grade 
5 (fatal) and another event was not recovered/resolved at the time of the patient’s death due to 
hospitalization-related complications and resultant cerebral haemorrhage. Six of the 11 patients who 
discontinued bleomycin prior to Cycle 5 Day 1 were able to complete frontline therapy with a 
combination of brentuximab vedotin and AVD. 
This pulmonary toxicity signal emerged after the DLT evaluation period (Cycle 2 Day 1) and events 
primarily occurred between Cycles 4 and 6. After the brentuximab vedotin with ABVD regimen had 
established the MTD at 1.2 mg/kg, and with pulmonary toxicity observed in later treatment cycles, the 
additional regimen combining brentuximab vedotin with AVD was added to the protocol study design to 
assess safety and efficacy in a regimen omitting bleomycin. No patients in the brentuximab vedotin 
with AVD regimen experienced pulmonary toxicity.  
Efficacy results 
Per investigator assessment, the complete remission (CR) rate for all 51 patients at EOT was 80%: 
68% in the brentuximab vedotin with ABVD regimen and 92% in the brentuximab vedotin with AVD 
regimen. Response assessments at EOT were missing for 7 patients (14%): 6 patients (24%) in the 
brentuximab vedotin with ABVD regimen and 1 patient (4%) in the brentuximab vedotin with AVD 
regimen. 
Progression-free survival rate was 85% for patients in the brentuximab vedotin with ABVD regimen at 
12 months, and 95% for patients in the brentuximab vedotin with AVD regimen. 
2.4.2.  Main study

The following medications and procedures were allowed during the study: 
-  Radiotherapy: Patients in PR upon completion of frontline chemotherapy with PET results 
indicative of PET-positive disease could have received radiotherapy. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The use of topical, inhalational and ophthalmic steroids was permitted.  
Patients were allowed to receive concomitant hormonal therapy provided they had been on a 
stable dosage for at least 1 month before enrolment.  
The use of platelet and/or red blood cell supportive growth factors or transfusions was allowed 
when applicable. 
The use of colony stimulating factors (CSFs) for neutropenia was permitted during therapy for 
patients in both treatment arms according to institutional practice. The use of prophylactic CSFs 
for neutropenia was recommended for patients in the A+AVD treatment arm starting with the 
first treatment cycle. 
A switch to a physician’s choice of alternative therapy for the remainder of frontline therapy was 
permitted at the investigator’s discretion after the Cycle 2 CT scan and PET assessment (including 
those with a Deauville score of 5). A switch to alternative frontline medication (AFM) for other reasons 
(such as adverse event) was also permitted at the investigator’s discretion.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the mPFS per IRF assessment obtained with 
A+AVD to that obtained with ABVD for the frontline treatment of advanced HL. 
The key secondary objective was to determine if A+AVD improved OS vs that obtained with ABVD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Modified (m)PFS per IRF assessment using the criteria defined in the Revised Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lymphoma. 
mPFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first of (1) 
documentation of PD; (2) death due to any cause; (3) for patients who failed to achieve a CR 
per IRF, receipt of subsequent anticancer therapy for HL after completion of frontline therapy. 
The mPFS event date for these patients was the date of the first PET scan post completion of 
frontline therapy demonstrating the absence of a CR, defined as a Deauville score of ≥3.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
-  Overall survival (OS) was the key secondary endpoint, defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the date of death. 
-  Rate of CR as best overall response achieved at the end of randomized regimen (A+AVD or 
ABVD) per IRF assessment using the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. 
- 
Event-free survival (EFS) defined as the time from randomization until any cause of treatment 
failure: disease progression, premature discontinuation of randomized treatment for any 
reason, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

Sample size 
The study is powered on the following assumption: a 2-year mPFS of 81% for patients in the A+AVD 
treatment group versus 73% for patients in the ABVD treatment group (HR = 0.67, assuming an 
emergent plateau in the PFS event rate after 2 years). A total of 260 mPFS events will provide 90% 
power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67 at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025 using a log-rank test. 
Approximately 1240 patients will be randomized to achieve (with 95% probability) 260 mPFS events in 
about 60 months assuming 36 months of accrual, a 5% annual dropout rate, and 24 months of mPFS 
follow-up after last patient in. 
The original sample size was lower (1040 patients), and increased to 1240 patients in protocol 
amendment 7 in March 2015. The 200 patient increase in sample size was accepted at follow up 
scientific advice in 2014. During the original design of ECHELON-1, assumptions regarding the 
expected number of progression events for the control arm were made on the basis of FFS estimates 
from an intergroup cooperative study comparing ABVD with Stanford V in 404 patients with locally 
extensive HL. However, aggregate data for 299 patients and a 167-patient dataset for patients with 
advanced HL from the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) provided the sponsor with an 
Assessment report

opportunity to revise projected estimates of the expected mPFS rate for the patient population in 
ECHELON-1. The statistical modelling with the aggregate data and the 167-patient dataset suggested 
that an increased sample size of 1240 randomized patients provided a higher than 90% projected 
probability of accruing 260 mPFS events by 2 years after randomization of the last patient. The revised 
statistical modelling for ECHELON-1 using the data from the BCCA suggested that approximately 90% 
of mPFS events occurred within 2 years of the initial diagnosis with an emergent plateau in the PFS 
event rate after approximately 2 years. A similar trend of few late progression events was noted in 
published results from other well controlled studies in patients with advanced HL. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either A+AVD or ABVD, with stratification by the number of 
International Prognostic Factor Project (IPFP) risk factors (0-1 vs 2-3 vs 4-7), and region (Americas vs 
Asia vs Europe). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study; investigators and patients were not blinded to the individual treatment 
assignments. However, the sponsor’s study team, investigators, and patients were blinded to 
aggregate efficacy data throughout the study according to a prespecified blinding procedure. The 
independent review facility (IRF) was blinded to study treatment assignments. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The primary population for efficacy analysis was the intent to treat (ITT) population, which included all 
randomized patients. The Per-Protocol (PP) population included all randomized patients who do not 
have a major protocol violation, and will be analysed according to the actual treatment received. The 
PP population was used as supportive analysis for the primary endpoint. 
The response-evaluable population was defined as the subset of the ITT population with diagnosis as 
confirmed by an independent pathology review facility, with measurable disease at baseline, who 
receive at least 1 dose of study drug, and have at least 1 post-baseline response assessment. The 
response-evaluable population was used for the analyses of CR rate, overall response rate, and 
duration of response. 
Analysis methods 
Primary hypothesis to be tested: 
The primary null hypothesis is that there is no difference in modified progression-free survival 
(mPFS) between the 2 treatments of A+AVD and ABVD. The alternative hypothesis is that 
A+AVD improves mPFS. 
Key secondary hypothesis to be tested: 
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in overall survival (OS) between the 2 
treatments of A+AVD and ABVD. The alternative hypothesis is that A+AVD improves OS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 42/121 
 
 
 
Modified PFS was to be tested at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025. The key secondary endpoint was 
to be tested at 1-sided, 0.025 level only when the test of the primary endpoint (mPFS) is statistically 
significant. 
Interim analysis 
Two interim analyses were planned:  
- 
The first formal interim analysis to be performed was a futility analysis. The CR rate at the end 
of frontline therapy will be analysed when the first approximately 348 patients have completed 
the regimen to which they were randomized or have discontinued treatment prior to 
completion.  
o  An independent data monitoring committee (IMDC) reviewed safety and efficacy data 
at the interim analysis. 
- 
The second formal interim analysis was for OS to be performed at the time of the final mPFS 
analysis. Overall type-I error for OS will be controlled using the O’Brien-Fleming method with a 
Lan-DeMets alpha spending function, with final OS analysis scheduled for when 112 deaths 
have occurred. 
Primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
Final analysis of mPFS was planned to be performed when 260 mPFS events have been observed, 
which was estimated to occur by 24 months after the last patient is randomized.  
Stratified log-rank testing was to be used to compare mPFS between the 2 treatment arms as the 
primary analysis. The stratification factors included region and number of IPFP risk factors at baseline. 
The hazard ratios along with the 95% confidence interval (CI; 2-sided) were estimated using the 
stratified Cox model with treatment as the explanatory variable. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival 
curves and survival probability at 2 and 3 years along with the 2-sided 95% CIs were provided for 
each treatment group. In addition, a stratified Cox regression model was used to further evaluate the 
treatment effects on mPFS after adjusting for some prognostic factors. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed for mPFS to evaluate the robustness of treatment effects.  
Key secondary endpoint analysis 
There were 2 formal analyses planned for OS, an OS interim analysis at the time of the final mPFS 
analysis, and the OS final analysis when 112 deaths have occurred. OS analysis was based on the ITT 
population. Overall type I error was controlled using the O’Brien-Fleming method with a Lan-DeMets 
alpha spending function. Stratified log-rank testing was used to compare OS between the 2 treatment 
arms. The stratification factors were similar to the primary endpoint analysis. 
The hazard ratios along with the 95% CIs (2-sided) were estimated using a stratified Cox regression 
model. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distribution of the OS endpoint for each 
treatment. 
Missing data handling 
In general, missing data will be treated as missing and no data imputation will be applied, unless 
otherwise specified. For Quality of Life Data, missing elements may be substituted with the average of 
non-missing items per published methods of analysis. 
Assessment report

Last observation carried forward method and multiple imputation method may be considered for some 
clinical outcomes as deemed appropriate. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The planned sample size was 1240 patients, and a total of 1334 patients were actually included in the 
ITT population and randomized to receive A+ AVD (n=664) or ABVD (n=670; Figure 25). The study 
was conducted in 218 investigative sites located in 21 countries across 4 regions: Asia Pacific, Europe, 
Latin America and North America. 
Figure 22 Study C25003: Subject Disposition as of 20 April 2017 Data Cut-off 
A total of 91 A+AVD patients (14%) and 123 ABVD patients (18%) are off study; for 28 A+AVD 
patients (4%) and 39 ABVD patients (6%), the off study reason was death. A small percentage of 
patients on the A+AVD arm and ABVD arm (14 patients [2%] and 9 patients [1%], respectively, Table 
24) completed frontline treatment with an AFM.

Conduct of the study 
Study protocol amendments 
The original protocol was dated 29 March 2012, and subsequently amended 7 times. Key changes are 
described below: 
Protocol amendment 1 (12 May 2012, no patients enrolled under this amendment) 
-  Changed the mPFS event date for patients who receive subsequent anticancer chemotherapy in 
absence of disease progression. The mPFS event will be recorded as occurring on the date of 
the first PET scan post completion of frontline therapy demonstrating the absence of a CR, 
defined as a Deauville score of ≥3. 
-  Specified that Deauville scoring must be performed for the EOT PET scan and any unscheduled 
PET scan to support objective determination of mPFS. 
Protocol amendment 3 (13 Jul 2012 , no patients enrolled) 
-  Changed the scheduled timing of the Cycle 2 PET/CT scan to Day 25 (± 1 day). 
Protocol amendment 4 (3 Aug 2012, 615 patients enrolled) 
-  Allow sites’ determination of PET positivity to guide additional radiotherapy for noncomplete 
responders at the conclusion of frontline therapy, and allow radiation to be given for patients 
with PET-positive residual masses of any size instead of only those with masses of 2.5 cm or 
larger. 
-  Clarify that, unless otherwise specified, only those SAEs that occur during long term follow-up 
that are considered related to study drug (instead of ‘frontline therapy’) will be reported. 
Protocol amendment 5 (6 Feb 2014, 1 patient enrolled) 
-  Add acute pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity to the discussion of potential risks associated with 
brentuximab vedotin. 
Protocol amendment 6 (27 May 2014, 536 patients enrolled) 
-  Remove the exclusion criterion pertaining to pulmonary diffusion capacity. 
Protocol amendment 7 (2 Mar 2015, 182 patients enrolled) 
- 
- 
Increase the sample size by 200 patients to a total of approximately 1240 patients, and 
increase the anticipated enrolment period. 
Increase enrolment to 620 patients per arm, and increase the estimated number of sites to 
250 globally. 
-  Align the timing of interim OS analysis with final mPFS analysis 
-  Revise timing of final OS analysis. 
Changes in the SAP 
A revised statistical analysis plan (SAP) was submitted in conjunction with protocol amendment 7. The 
revised SAP described the rationale for the increase in the planned number of randomized patients and 
the revised assumptions pertaining to the analysis of the primary endpoint, mPFS. 
Changes in analysis 
A number of additional subgroup analyses not described in the SAP were added to the prespecified 
analyses in June 2016, approximately 1 year before clinical database lock, without knowledge of the 
treatment effect in efficacy data. These included mPFS per IRF and mPFS per investigator by age

dichotomized around 45 and 65 years, ECOG performance status score 0 vs 1 vs 2, and gender (male 
vs female). 
Protocol compliance 
The major protocol deviations identified in the study fell into 2 categories: 
- 
Patients who were enrolled in the study even though they did not satisfy eligibility criteria (n=4 
in A+ AVD arm vs. n=12 in ABVD arm). 
- 
Patients who received incorrect treatment or dose of the study drug(s) n=9 in A+ AVD arm vs. 
n=2 in ABVD arm). 
No deviations were identified relating to patients receiving excluded medication or not being 
discontinued from the study despite study withdrawal criteria being met. 
Baseline data 
Patient demographics were generally balanced between the two treatment arms (Table 21). Most 
patients were male (~58% in both arms), white (~83%) and not Hispanic or Latino (86%). The 
median age was ~36 years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 46/121 
 
 
 
 
Table 20: Study 25003: Demographics (ITT population) 
The demographic characteristics of patients in the ITT population with Stage IV disease were 
comparable with that of the ITT population as a whole. The demographic characteristics of patients in 
the ITT population with extranodal involvement were also similar with that of the ITT population as a 
whole. 
Baseline disease characteristics were also generally balanced between the 2 treatment arms in the ITT 
population (Table 22). The initial time since diagnosis was <1 month in both arms, and the majority of 
patients had nodular sclerosis classical HL (~61%), with Ann Arbor Stage IV at diagnosis (~63%). The 
majority of patients had at least 2 IPFP risk factors (~78%), and an ECOG performance score of 0 
(57%) or 1 (39%).

The baseline disease characteristics for the subgroup of the ITT population with Stage IV disease were 
well balanced between treatment arms, and generally similar with the ITT population. Fewer patients 
with stage IV disease had 0-1 IPFP risk factors (13% and 10% in the A+AVD and ABVD arms, 
respectively, compared with 21% in both arms in the ITT population), and more patients with Stage IV 
disease had 4-7 IPFP risk factors (34% and 36%, compared with 25% and 27%). Patients with Stage 
IV disease also had more bone marrow involvement and more evidence of extranodal involvement.

Concomitant medication 
A higher use of myeloid growth factors was reported for the A+AVD patients possibly as concomitant 
medication or secondary prophylaxis for neutropenia. At least 1 myeloid growth factor 
(immunostimulant) was reported as a concomitant medication for 536 A+AVD patients (81%) and 373 
ABVD patients (57%). Filgrastim was the most commonly reported growth factor for patients in both 
treatment arms, and was reported for 405 A+AVD patients (61%) and 286 ABVD patients (43%). 
Numbers analysed 
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses were based on the ITT analysis set, defined as all 1334 
randomized patients. A summary of all study populations is provided below.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint – modified Progression-Free Survival per IRF 
As of the 20 April 2017 data cut-off date for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, median 
mPFS was not reached in either treatment arm. At this time, 117 mPFS events had been observed in 
the A+AVD arm and 146 mPFS events had been observed in the ABVD arm. A+AVD was associated 
with a 23.0% reduction in the risk of an mPFS event versus ABVD (HR=0.770; 95% CI, 0.603-0.983). 
This improvement was statistically significant (P=0.035). The proportion of patients free from an mPFS 
event at 2 years after randomization was 82.1% in the A+AVD arm versus 77.2% in the ABVD arm 
(95% CI, 78.8-85.0% versus 73.7-80.4%; Table 25).

The results for mPFS per investigator (INV, sensitivity analysis 2a: see also forest plot of sensitivity 
analysis) for the ITT population support the primary efficacy analysis. The stratified hazard ratio was 
0.724 (95% CI, 0.573-0.914) indicating a 27.6% reduction in the risk of mPFS with A+AVD compared 
with ABVD (p=0.006). The mPFS rate per INV was 81.0% for the A+AVD patients vs 74.4% for ABVD 
patients at 2 years.  
Figure 24 Study C25003: KM Plot of mPFS per INV Assessment (ITT) 
A concordance analysis between IRF and INV assessments of mPFS events showed that of 1334 cases 
assessed for mPFS events, 1214 (91%) were concordant. The concordance was the same in both 
arms. 
mPFS for PP population 
A supplementary analysis of mPFS per IRF using the PP population is consistent with those obtained for 
the primary endpoint using the ITT population. The stratified HR was 0.769 (95% CI 0.600, 0.986; 
p=0.037). 
Sensitivity analyses of mPFS  
A sensitivity analysis of mPFS per IRF was performed in which the following events each were 
considered mPFS events:  
1)  treatment discontinuation for undocumented disease progression after the last adequate 
assessment, and  
2)  an event after more than 1 missed visit. 
Results of this analysis were consistent with results of the primary analysis. The stratified hazard ratio 
was 0.765 (95% CI, 0.603-0.970, p=0.026). At 2 years, the rate of patients alive without progression 
or a modified progression event (modified progression-free) was 81% in the A+AVD arm vs 76% in the 
ABVD arm. 
Another analysis was performed for mPFS per INV, showing similar results. 
Additional sensitivity analyses of mPFS 
In the ITT population, sensitivity analyses were performed for mPFS to evaluate the robustness of 
treatment effects. Included among the analyses were alterations of the handling of missing

assessments and censoring, on the basis of 1 alteration per analysis (for exact definitions see section 
statistical methods above). The sensitivity analyses of mPFS were generally consistent with the 
primary analysis. For the ITT population, a forest plot of mPFS sensitivity analyses.

Subgroup analysis of mPFS 
A treatment benefit was observed with A+AVD in some baseline disease factor-defined subgroups 
(Figure 29 and additional subgroups in Table 26). Subgroups that did not show a treatment benefit 
with A+AVD were patients ≥65 years of age (N=122; HR=1.010; 95% CI: 0.525, 1.942) patients ≥60 
years of age (N=186; HR=1.002; 95% CI: 0.583, 1.722),   and patients with no extranodal disease at 
baseline (N=445; HR=1.042; 95% CI: 0.670, 1.619).  
A substantial number of subgroups demonstrated a HR <1 but confidence intervals crossing 1. These 
subgroups were: patients <45 years (n=874), patients ≥45 years (n=460), female patients (n=558), 
patients with a Cycle 2 PET Deauville Score of 5 (n=51), patients from Europe (n=669) or Asia 
(n=142), patients with baseline cancer stage III (n=483), patients with present (n=781) or absent 
(n=553) B symptoms, patients with Cycle 2 PET results positive (n=105) or negative (n=1165), 
patients that received alternative frontline therapy (n=24), and patients in all three categories of ECOG 
performance status/baseline extranodal sites(1,>1) / and number of IPFP sites.

Table 26 Study C25003: Subgroup Analysis of mPFS per IRF Assessment 
Subgroup: mPFS for patients in the ITT with Stage III and IV disease 
For these patients, the unstratified HR was 0.711 (95% CI: 0.529, 0.956), indicating a 28.9% 
reduction in the risk of an mPFS event for A+AVD patients with Stage IV disease compared with ABVD 
patients (p=0.023). At 2 years, the rate of patients with Stage IV disease without mPFS events was 
82.0% (95% CI: 77.8, 85.5) for A+AVD patients (No. of patients at risk=205) vs 75.3% (95% CI: 
70.6, 79.3) for ABVD patients (No. of patients at risk=186). 
For patients with less advanced disease (Stage III) the unstratified HR was 0.922 (95% CI: 0.599, 
1.419), indicating an 7.8% improvement in the risk of an mPFS event for A+AVD patients compared 
with ABVD patients (p=0.712). At 2 years, the rate of patients with Stage III disease without mPFS 
events was 82.1% (95% CI: 76.0, 86.8) for A+AVD patients (No. of patients at risk=104) vs 81.0% 
(95% CI: 75.1, 85.6) for ABVD patients (No. of patients at risk=106).

Survival model of mixed cure analysis on mPFS 
Based on a prespecified mixed cure analysis with a Weibull survival model on mPFS per IRF with 
treatment as a factor, the estimated cure rates were 79.1% and 75.0% for the A+AVD patients and 
the ABVD patients, respectively. The odds ratio of not cured was 0.791 (95% CI, 0.592; 1.056), 
indicating that patients in the A+AVD arm had a 20.9% reduction in the odds of not being cured 
(equivalently, a 26.4% increase in the odds of being cured) compared with patients in the ABVD arm, 
and the RR of 0.741 (95% CI, 0.538; 1.022) indicated that patients who were not cured had a 25.9% 
reduction in the risk of having an mPFS event for patients on the A+AVD arm compared with patients 
on the ABVD arm.

PFS 
This analysis of PFS included only death and progressive disease as events. After a median follow-up of 
approximately 25 months, a total of 238 PFS events and 241 PFS events were observed in the ITT 
population by IRF and investigator assessment, respectively. The median PFS was not estimable for 
either treatment arm by either IRF or investigator assessment, with censored PFS of 0 to 49 months. 
The stratified HR for PFS per IRF was 0.830 (95% CI: 0.642, 1.071; p=0.150). An estimated 83.1% 
(95% CI: 79.8%, 85.9%) of A+AVD patients vs 79.8% (95% CI: 76.3%, 82.8%) of ABVD patients 
were alive without progression at 2 years. The stratified HR for PFS per investigator was 0.701 (95% 
CI: 0.542, 0.905; p=0.006). An estimated 84.2% (95% CI: 81.1%, 86.9%) of A+AVD patients vs 
78.0% (95% CI: 74.4%, 81.1%) of ABVD patients were alive without progression at 2 years.

Key secondary endpoint  
Overall survival – interim analysis 
This interim analysis of OS was performed coincident with the final mPFS analysis at 20 April 2017 
data cutoff, at which time 67 deaths had occurred in the ITT population (5% of the ITT population). A 
final OS analysis is planned when 112 deaths have been reported in the study, to be approximately 4 
years after randomization of the last patient. 
The median OS was not reached (Figure 33). After a median follow-up of approximately 28 months, 28 
deaths (4%) were reported in the A+AVD treatment arm and 39 deaths (6%) in the ABVD treatment 
arm. The stratified HR was 0.728, (95% CI, 0.448; 1.184), with statistical significance not met 
(p=0.199). The estimated OS rate was 96.6% for the A+AVD patients vs 94.2% for ABVD patients at 2 
years; and 94.4% for A+AVD patients vs 92.9% for ABVD patients at 3 years.

Other secondary endpoints 
Complete Remission (CR) rate by IRF 
At the end of randomized treatment, the CR rate was 73% in the A+AVD arm vs. 70% in the ABVD 
arm. At the end of frontline treatment, the CR rate was 73% vs. 71%, respectively. At the end of cycle 
2, 69% and 67%, respectively, achieved CR.

Objective Response Rate (ORR) by IRF 
The ORR at the end of randomization regimen was also similar between treatment arms: 86% 
(A+AVD) vs. 83% (ABVD; Table 30). 
Concordance between IRF and INV assessments of CR and ORR 
The IRF and INV ORR assessments were concordant for 1215 of 1334 patients (91%) and the 
concordance rates were similar for each of the treatment arms. A lower overall concordance rate of 
75% was noted for the CR assessments at the end of the randomized regimen treatment period and at 
the end of frontline therapy. 
PET negativity at Cycle 2 and Deauville Scores 
At the end of Cycle 2, the PET negativity rate was 89% versus 86% (RR 1.028 [95% CI, 0.99; 1.07]; 
Table 30). 
At the end of frontline therapy, the rates of Deauville scores ≤3 were 86% vs 82% (RR 1.044 [95% 
CI, 1.00; 1.09]) and the rates of scores ≤2 were 85% vs 80% (RR 1.058 [95% CI, 1.01; 1.11]). 
Event-free survival (EFS) 
The median EFS by IRF assessment was not estimable for either treatment arm. The stratified HR 
indicated no significant difference between treatment arms: 0.900 (95% CI, 0.726; 1.117, p=0.339). 
An estimated 76.5% of A+AVD patients vs. an 73.7% of ABVD patients were event free at 2 years; at 
3 years, the frequencies were 73.9% and 71.5%, respectively. 
Disease-free survival (DFS) 
The median DFS by IRF assessment was not estimable (NE) for either treatment arm. The stratified 
hazard ratio was 0.701 (95% CI, 0.504-0.976; p=0.034), favouring the A+ AVD arm. An estimated 
88% of patients achieving CR on the A+AVD arm (95% CI, 84-90%) versus an estimated 82% of 
patients achieving CR on the ABVD arm (95% CI, 78-86%) were DFS-event free at 2 years. At 3 years 
86% vs. 81% of patients achieving CR were DFS-event free, respectively. 
Duration of response (DOR) by IRF 
The median DOR by IRF assessment was not estimable for either treatment arm. A total of 628 of 664 
A+AVD patients (95%) and 623 of 670 ABVD patients (93%) achieved a best overall response of PR or 
better. Among them, almost similar frequencies of patients had disease progression after objective 
response (86 patients [14%] versus 99 patients [16%], respectively).  
Duration of complete remission (DOCR) by IRF 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 64/121 
 
 
 
 
 
By IRF assessment, median DOCR was not estimable for either treatment arm of the ITT population 
who had a best response of CR. After a median follow-up of 22.7 months, the number of patients who 
progressed after achieving a best response of CR was 59 of 543 A+AVD patients (11%) and 72 of 528 
ABVD patients (14%). 
Subsequent anticancer therapy 
Slightly fewer A+AVD arm patients (121 patients, 18%) received at least 1 subsequent anticancer 
therapy compared with ABVD patients (144 patients, 22%).  
Subsequent chemotherapy was received by 10% in the A+AVD arm (n=66) vs. 15% in the ABVD arm 
(n=99), and high-dose chemotherapy + transplant in 5% (n=36) vs. 8% (n=54). Consolidative 
radiation was received by 8% of patients on each treatment arms. 
Time to subsequent systemic therapy was defined as the time from first dose to the date of the first 
documentation of subsequent therapy which excludes radiation only treatment or to the time of 
censoring. Patients without subsequent systemic therapy were censored at last contact date or date of 
death. The stratified HR was 0.690 (95% CI: 0.517, 0.921; p=0.011). 
In the ITT population, 33% fewer patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVD in the ITT population 
received subsequent salvage chemotherapy (n=66) and high-dose chemotherapy and transplant 
(n=36) compared with those treated with ABVD (n=99 and n=54, respectively). In the Stage IV 
population, 35% fewer patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVD received subsequent salvage 
chemotherapy (n=45) compared with those treated with ABVD (n=69) and 22% fewer patients treated 
with ADCETRIS + AVD received high-dose chemotherapy and transplant (n=29) compared with those 
treated with ABVD (n=37). 
Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) per European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC) QLQ C30. 
Compliance (ITT) 
Compliance was defined as the number of forms actually completed as a proportion of those 
anticipated. Over time, compliance was generally high in both the A+AVD and ABVD groups, ranging 
from 86% to 98% across the treatment arms.

Antitherapeutic antibodies (ATA) 
At the end of frontline therapy, immunogenicity status and response rates were examined in the 632 
immunogenicity-evaluable patients of the A+AVD-treated safety population. Of these, 109 patients 
(17.2%) were anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA) positive at any time post-baseline. 
Response per IRF was calculated for the subset of transiently ATA-positive patients (positive in 1 or 2 
post-baseline samples) and the subset of persistently ATA-positive patients (positive in >2 post-
baseline samples). 
The majority of transiently ATA-positive patients (87 patients, 83%) achieved CR at the end of 
frontline therapy, whereas 1 of 4 persistently ATA-positive patients achieved CR at the end of frontline 
therapy. All 4 persistently ATA positive patients achieved an objective response at the end of frontline 
therapy. 
Response rates by ATA titer status 
Of the 108 patients with a positive ATA status who had their titer assessed, 106 patients had a low 
ATA titer and 2 patients had a high ATA titer. Most of the patients with a low titer achieved a response 
Assessment report

of CR or PR (99 of 106) and both patients with a high titer achieved a response of CR at the end of 
frontline therapy. 
Response rates by ATA neutralizing antibody (nATA) response status (positive/negative) 
The proportion of patients who achieved a CR at the end of frontline therapy was similar for 
neutralizing antibody (nATA)- positive (83%) and nATA-negative (80%) patients; 2 of the 12 patients 
(17%) who were nATA positive achieved a PR at the end of frontline therapy compared with 11 of 95 
(12%) patients who were nATA negative.  
Exploratory endpoints 
PRO per FACIT-Dyspnea 10 (lung-specific PRO, ITT) 
Compliance ranged from 86% to 98% across treatment arms. 
PRO per Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/ Gynecologic Oncology Group- Neurotoxicity 
(FACT/GOG-Ntx) subscale questionnaire (ITT) 
Compliance ranged from 85% to 98% across treatment arms. 
Patient-reported health utility values per EuroQoL (EQ)-5D-3L 
Compliance ranged from 87% to 99% across treatment arms. 
Overall, mean scores over time were not different between the 2 treatment arms on the basis of the 
MID of 0.07 established for the UK TTO score. During PTFU, mean scores returned to Baseline levels or 
better. Trends observed for the US-based value set were consistent with those observed for the UK-
based value set.  
Utilization of medical resources 
Medical resource utilization was assessed from Screening through PTFU. At least 1 hospitalization was 
reported for a higher number of patients in the A+ AVD arm (n= 242, 36%) compared to the ABVD 
arm (n=186 ABVD, 28%). 
The median number of days of hospitalization among patients who were hospitalized at least once was 
similar across treatment arms (9 vs. 8 days, respectively).  
The hospitalization visit rate per patient-year was 0.3363 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.37) for A+AVD patients 
and 0.2277 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.25) for ABVD patients. An AE or toxicity was the most commonly 
reported reason for hospitalization. 
MRU among patients in the ITT population with Stage IV were similar that of the ITT population. 
Percent of patients alive without HL at 3 and 5 years 
As of the 20 April 2017 data cut-off date, approximately one quarter of patients have had the 
opportunity to be followed for 3 years and no patient has yet to have been followed for 5 years. 
There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.795) in the estimated proportion of patients in the 
ITT population alive without HL at 3 years between the A+AVD treatment arm (70%) and the ABVD 
treatment arm (71%). 
Percent of patients switching therapy after Cycle 2 and before EOT 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 67/121 
 
 
 
 
After the Cycle 2 PET assessment, patients could be switched to an AFM of the physician’s choice for 
the remainder of planned frontline therapy without the switch being considered an mPFS event. While 
this was permitted, in practice, very few patients were switched to an AFM. 
A total of 15 A+AVD patients (2%) and 9 ABVD patients (1%) received an AFM. All patients receiving 
AFM switched to another form of chemotherapy. The reason for switching was primarily an adverse 
event (54%) or Deauville score (21%). 
Ancillary analyses 
Post hoc subgroup analyses for patients with Stage IV: 
Post-hoc subgroup analyses of modified PFS per IRF for patients with Stage IV disease were performed 
including age, region, baseline extranodal sites, number of IPFP risk factors, baseline B symptoms, 
baseline ECOG status and gender. The analyses showed a consistent trend towards benefit for patients 
who received ADCETRIS + AVD compared with patients who received ABVD in most subgroups. 
Patients with Stage IV disease for whom extranodal disease was reported ([n=722] [HR=0.69, 95% CI 
(0.50, 0.94)]) showed an mPFS (per IRF) benefit. In patients with Stage IV disease for whom no 
extranodal disease was reported, no benefit has been shown at time of analysis ([n=85] [HR=1.49, 
95% CI (0.51, 4.31)]). The significance of this finding in stage IV HL patients with no extranodal 
disease is not established due to small patient numbers and low event rates (14 events). The efficacy 
in elderly patients with Stage IV disease in the A + AVD arm (patients ≥ 60 years of age [n=118] 
[HR=0.80, 95% CI (0.42, 1.53)] and ≥ 65 years of age [n=78] [HR=0.78, 95% CI (0.36, 1.67)]) 
showed better benefit compared with elderly patients in ITT population. 
Subgroup analysis on OS 
Subgroup: OS for Patients in the ITT with Baseline Stage IV Disease 
The median OS was not reached for the subgroup with Stage IV disease (Figure 34). The unstratified 
HR was 0.507 (95% CI, 0.265; 0.971, p=0.037), suggesting a larger benefit in this subgroup 
compared to the overall ITT population. At 2 years, the OS rate was 97.4% (95% CI: 95.3, 98.5) for 
A+AVD patients (No. of patients at risk=280) vs 93.4% (95% CI: 90.3, 95.6) for ABVD patients (No. 
of patients at risk=258); at 3 years it was 95.8% (95% CI: 91.8, 97.9) for A+AVD patients (No. of 
patients at risk=79) vs 93.1% (95% CI: 89.9, 95.3) for ABVD patients (No. of patients at risk=66).

Table 33 ECHELON-1: OS (ITT Population With Stage III HL) 
Subgroup: OS for Patients in the ITT with Extranodal Involvement 
The median OS was not reached in the subgroup of patients with extranodal involvement (≥1 
extranodal sites) either. The unstratified hazard ratio was 0.431 (95% CI, 0.218; 0.852, p=0.013), 
suggesting a greater OS benefit than the overall ITT population in this subgroup as well. At 2 years, 
the OS rate was 97.5% (95% CI: 95.4, 98.6) for A+AVD patients (No. of patients at risk=268) vs 
93.4% (95% CI: 90.3, 95.6) for ABVD patients (No. of patients at risk=257); at 3 years it was 97.1% 
(95% CI: 94.8, 98.4) for A+AVD patients (No. of patients at risk=72) vs 92.2% (95% CI: 88.3, 94.8) 
for ABVD patients (No. of patients at risk=69).

Clinical studies in special populations 
Elderly 
In the pivotal study, 84 patients (13%) in the A+AVD arm, and 102 patients (15%) in the ABVD arm 
were ≥60 years of age. Approximately 61 patients in both arms (9%) were ≥ 65 years of age.  
The percentage of patients age 60 years or older receiving subsequent anticancer therapy was similar 
across treatment arms (A+AVD 19% [n=16 of 83] versus ABVD 17% [n=17 of 98]). In the safety 
population slightly fewer A+AVD arm patients (121 patients, 18%) received at least 1 subsequent 
anticancer therapy compared with ABVD patients (144 patients, 22%).  
As of the 20 April 2017 data cut-off and after a median follow-up of 28 months, 32 deaths had 
occurred among patients who were age 60 years or older: 15 deaths (18% of this subgroup of older 
patients) on the A+AVD arm and 17 deaths (17% of this subgroup of older patients) on the ABVD arm. 
No data has been presented for patients <60 years of age. In the ITT, a slightly larger difference 
between treatment arms was observed: 28 deaths (4%) were reported in the A+AVD treatment arm 
and 39 deaths (6%) in the ABVD treatment arm after a median follow-up of approximately 28 months.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Clinical efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in frontline HL patients has been investigated in Study 
ECHELON-1. This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label trial comparing the modified progression-free 
survival (mPFS) obtained with brentuximab vedotin + AVD (Adcetris plus doxorubicin [Adriamycin], 
vinblastine and dacarbazine, abbreviated A+ AVD; n=664) versus that obtained with ABVD 
(doxorubicin [Adriamycin], bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, n=670). Patients were required to 
have treatment-naïve histologically confirmed classical HL, with Ann Arbor Stage III or IV. 
The proposed dose of brentuximab vedotin is 1.2 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion in combination with 
AVD. This is a lower starting dose compared to the existing 1.8 mg/kg monotherapy dose, but with a 
more frequent dosing schedule (every 2 weeks, instead of every 3 weeks) to maintain similar 
exposure. In line with scientific advice by the CHMP, outcomes of the Phase 1 study and PK from 
ECHELON-1 were used to substantiate the proposed dosing regimen, which is acceptable. 
In Phase-1 study SGN35-009, brentuximab vedotin in combination with the standard frontline 
chemotherapy combination ABVD resulted in an increased incidence of pulmonary adverse events, 
likely due to the combination of bleomycin and brentuximab vedotin. A combination chemotherapy 
omitting bleomycin (AVD instead of ABVD) was therefore selected for pivotal study ECHELON-1. The 
comparator arm ABVD was accepted by the CHMP during scientific advice in 2011. Although the 
alternative treatment option BEACOPP-escalated (bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone escalated dose regime) could also be used in 
fit patients <60 years of age according to the ESMO clinical practice guideline, it was agreed with the 
applicant that ABVD is the preferred regimen for advanced HL in Europe. The more pronounced toxicity 
has prevented widespread utilization of BEACOPP and some randomized clinical studies indicate that 
the long-term clinical outcome for ABVD and standard BEACOPP is similar.  
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 74/121 
 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint mPFS is also in line with CHMP scientific advice and considered acceptable, as 
any effort has been made to limit the risk of investigator subjectivity with the decision to use 
subsequent anticancer chemotherapy. All patients were to be assessed for response post study drug 
treatment using Cheson criteria, the PET-CT scans were read independently and centrally, and the 
decision to start subsequent therapy was to be proposed according to judgement of the readers. This 
endpoint was chosen because the primary goal of frontline therapy in advanced stage HL is curative, 
and it is agreed that the modified PFS endpoint better reflects whether the goal of initial therapy has 
been achieved (CR). The sample size was increased during the study based on external information 
along with timing of interim OS analysis. Because this was based on external information, this is 
considered acceptable. After the Cycle 2 PET assessment, patients could be switched to alternative 
frontline medication (AFM) of the physician’s choice for the remainder of planned frontline therapy 
without the switch being considered an mPFS event. It is reassuring that, while this was permitted, in 
practice, very few patients were switched to an AFM (≤2% in both arms). Therefore, the estimate from 
this trial (where alternative frontline therapy was part of the treatment policy) would not be expected 
to differ substantially from that from a treatment policy where this would not have been allowed.  
The key secondary endpoint OS was not expected to demonstrate large differences in treatment arms, 
due to the very long survival and number of treatment options in relapsed setting, including SCT. 
Moreover, the secondary and exploratory QoL endpoints are considered difficult to interpret, because 
of the open-label design of the trial. 
Despite a higher use of myeloid growth factor in the A+AVD group concomitant medications were 
comparable between the treatment arms. 
The ECHELON-1 clinical database was reopened and revised after the initial database lock based on the 
20 April 2017 cut-off for data analysis to correct a data mapping error at the dataset level that 
substituted the screening date for randomization date in a high proportion (95%) of patients in the 
intent-to-treat (ITT) population.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Brentuximab vedotin +AVD treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement in IRF-based 
mPFS compared to ABVD treatment in the ITT, with a HR of 0.770 (95% CI, 0.603-0.983, p=0.035). 
At the 20 April 2017 data cut-off date, the median mPFS was not reached in either treatment arm and 
the KM plot of mPFS showed treatment curves in very close proximity of each other. From the PFS 
analysis, it is clear that the modified component (subsequent therapy for HL after completion of 
frontline therapy in patients who failed to achieve CR per IRF) is for a large part responsible for this 
result (difference in mPFS event free at 2 year: ~5% (p=0.035) vs ~3% (p=0.15) in favour of 
A+AVD). The proportion of patients free from a mPFS event at 2 years after randomization was 82.1% 
in the A+AVD arm versus 77.2% in the ABVD arm. Results from an INV-based mPFS analyses, as well 
as several sensitivity analyses were consistent with those obtained for the primary endpoint. The 
sensitivity analyses which were performed to further investigate the potential influence of the 
additional PFS event of ‘receipt of additional therapy’ in the mPFS definition produced point estimates 
for the hazard ratio which were generally consistent with those from the primary analysis.  
A higher proportion of patients who did not have a complete response in the ABVD arm received 
subsequent therapy compared with the A+AVD arm. Of the patients without CR at the end of frontline 
therapy, 58% (38/65) in the A+AVD arm received subsequent therapy, compared with 73% (58/79) in 
the ABVD arm. This discrepancy between the study arms in receiving subsequent therapy could be due 
to a variety of factors, among which the open label design of the study or persisting AEs after A+AVD. 
Additional sensitivity analysis provided for mPFS in which all patients who were non-complete

responders and still at risk of a PFS event at the time of post-frontline assessment were considered to 
have had an mPFS event showed consistency with the results from the primary PFS analysis. Thus, it is 
unlikely that the observed PFS results were overly influenced by the option to provide subsequent 
therapy to patients who did not demonstrate a complete response. Unfortunately, it is currently 
unknown whether the decision to provide a patient with subsequent therapy is associated with disease, 
treatment and patient factors at the time of the decision to provide subsequent therapy (after end of 
frontline therapy). Further analysis pursuing this issue were not requested as further assessment will 
be hampered by methodological concerns (non-randomized comparison after frontline therapy) and the 
outcome will not change the B/R of Adcetris for the requested indication. 
Several secondary endpoints supported the primary endpoint, showing similar efficacy, or slight 
differences in favour of A+AVD were observed (i.e. in CR rate, ORR, PET negativity rate at Cycle 2, 
DFS, EFS, and use of subsequent anticancer therapy). It is reassuring that overall survival data 
suggest similar results between A+ AVD and ABVD at the interim analysis as well. The concordance 
rates for ORR per IRF and Investigator was high (91%) whereas a lower concordance rate was 
observed for the CR rates per IRF and investigator at the end of randomized and frontline treatment, 
respectively. This pattern was however in line with what was observed for pivotal relapsed or 
refractory HL Study SG035-0003.  
Although a statistically significant efficacy benefit of A+AVD over ABVD has been observed in the ITT 
population, treatment effects were not consistent among all subgroups. Based on the forest plot 
analyses, A+AVD seems more effective in younger patients and patients with more advanced disease 
(lower HR with more IPFP risk factors, higher Cycle 2 PET Deauville score; and extranodal sites, B-
symptoms present or higher stage disease at baseline). The subgroup analyses showed that patients 
with stage IV disease (HR mPFS: 0.711 (95% CI 0.529, 0.956) or 1 or more extranodal sites (mPFS 
HR 0.699 (95% CI 0.518, 0.943) seem to experience more benefit of A+AVD when compared with the 
ITT population (HR=0.770 [95% CI 0.603, 0.983]; p=0.035). A+AVD patients with Stage III HL 
(HR=0.922, [95% CI 0.599-1.419]) or no sites of extranodal HL (HR=1.042, [95% CI 0.670- 1.619]) 
seemed to have no significant efficacy outcomes relative to ABVD than seen in the ITT and in stage IV 
patients. This may well be explained by an apparently higher efficacy of the control arm in patients 
with less advanced disease. It must be noted that the results of these subgroup analyses should be 
interpreted with caution due to the low number of events, wide confidence intervals and high censoring 
rates.  
Post-hoc subgroup analyses of modified PFS per IRF for patients with Stage IV disease were also 
provided. Patients with Stage IV disease for whom extranodal disease was reported ([n=722] 
[HR=0.69, 95% CI (0.50, 0.94)]) showed an mPFS (per IRF) benefit. In patients with Stage IV disease 
for whom no extranodal disease was reported, no benefit has been shown at time of analysis ([n=85] 
[HR=1.49, 95% CI (0.51, 4.31)]). The significance of this finding in stage IV HL patients with no 
extranodal disease is not established due to small patient numbers and low event rates (14 events). 
The observed differences in the effect size between stage IV patients with extranodal vs no extranodal 
disease is of clinical relevance. (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Regarding elderly patients, the risk of a mPFS event in the elderly ITT Population patients (stage III 
and IV) seems higher in the A+AVD arm as compared to ABVD (patients ≥ 60 years of age [n=186] 
[HR=1.00, 95% CI (0.58, 1.72)] and ≥ 65 years of age [n=122] [HR=1.01, 95% CI (0.53, 1.94)]). 
Elderly patients with stage IV HL had a trend towards a slightly favourable mPFS treated with A+AVD 
versus ABVD: patients aged ≥60, n=118, mPFS per IRF: HR = 0.804 (95% CI: 0.42 to 1.53), p = 
0.506 and patients aged ≥65, n=78, HR = 0.777 (95% CI: 0.36 to 1.67), p = 0.515. A favourable 
effect was also noticed in the Kaplan-Meier estimates from 1, 2, 2.5 and 3 years both for patients aged 
> 60 and >65 years. The same trend in favour of A+AVD was observed for OS events up to 3 years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 76/121 
 
 
 
However, the number of patients within the elderly stage IV subgroup is relatively small and the 
number of events is low with a high censoring rate (82% elderly stage IV). This leads to uncertainty in 
the HR point estimates of these subgroups, as illustrated by the wide confidence intervals. The data 
have been reflected in the SmPC section 5.1.  
PRO data did not indicate a clinically meaningful difference between treatment arms, but a trend of 
unfavourable scores on various subscales and symptom measures of EORTC-QLQ C30/ FACIT-Dyspnea 
10 was observed in the A+AVD arm compared with the ABVD arm during the treatment period. Medical 
resource utilization was slightly higher in the A+AVD arm (36% vs. 28% in the ABVD arm). These data 
are consistent with the higher frequency of AEs and SAEs observed in A+AVD patients. However, PTFU, 
scores on EORTC-QLQ C30 were observed to return to at least baseline levels.   
Immunogenicity data indicated that the presence of ATA or nATA was not associated with a reduction 
in efficacy response. 
From previous studies it is known that retreatment with brentuximab vedotin after ASCT is still 
effective. With the current proposed indication, brentuximab vedotin could in theory be considered 
three times during the course of the disease (frontline, after ASCT if at increased risk of relapse, and 
at relapse after ASCT). Due to the short follow up, limited data on retreatment after frontline therapy 
with brentuximab vedotin is currently available. The amendment of the ECHELON-1 study to include an 
extension of 10 year may provide some data on next line treatment although a thorough assessment 
of the efficacy of retreatment will likely not be feasible. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the ECHELON-1 comparing A+AVD vs ABVD in the first line HL treatment, a mPFS HR of 0.770 
(95% CI, 0.603-0.983, p=0.035) was in favour of the A+AVD arm.  
The mPFS effect was consistent across several sensitivity analyses. However, the point estimate of 
mPFS is compatible with a smaller effect in patients with less advanced disease, e.g. Stage III HL and 
patients with no extranodal disease at baseline, which may well be explained by an apparently higher 
efficacy of the control arm in patients with less advanced disease. The mPFS point estimate in the 
stage IV population is compatible with a higher effect of A+AVD over ABVD.  
The MAH is conducting a 10-year extension of the pivotal Phase 3 study C25003 (ECHELON-1). The 
extension study will follow-up on subsequent therapy and OS. Response data on retreatment and 
salvage therapy will be collected, as well as additional data with respect to next line treatment, such as 
the reason for the next therapy and the time period during which symptoms leading to next therapy 
have existed (e.g. in case there was delay of therapy for any reason).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
-  Results from the 10-year extension of the ECHELON-1 trial should be provided when available. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The existing safety profile of brentuximab vedotin administered as monotherapy is based on two single 
arm phase II studies in 160 patients diagnosed with relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL, one placebo

controlled Phase III trial (AETHERA) in 165 HL patients at increased risk for relapse after ASCT, and 
one Phase III open-label trial in patients with CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (ALCANZA).  
The safety and tolerability of brentuximab vedotin plus chemotherapy for the frontline treatment of 
patients with advanced stage HL was analysed in the pivotal Phase 3 study C25003 (ECHELON-1) with 
1321 patients (662 in the A+AVD arm and 659 In the ABVD arm) as well as in a Phase 1 study 
(SGN35-009) with 51 patients (26 in the A+AVD arm and 25 in the A+ABVD arm). 
A brief comparison of the safety profiles including the results from the pivotal Phase 3 trial (C25003) 
as well as the Phase 1 trial is provided below (Table 37). More detailed information regarding the 
C25003 trial is provided in the subsequent sections.

Patient exposure 
Safety data was presented for ECHELON-1, a randomized, Open-label, phase 3 trial of A+AVD versus 
ABVD as frontline therapy in patients with advanced cHL. Patients in the Safety population were 
analysed according to the actual treatment received. The Safety population consisted of 662 A+AVD 
patients and 659 ABVD patients who received at least 1 dose of any study drug in the study treatment 
regimen. The randomized treatment regimen was administered IV to patients in both treatment arms 
on day 1 and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle.  
The A+AVD patients received a median of 6 treatment cycles (range 1 to 6 cycles) over a median of 
24.2 weeks (range 2.0 to 35.0 weeks) for brentuximab vedotin, 24.5 weeks for doxorubicin and 
dacarbazine, and 24.4 weeks for vinblastine (range 2.0 to 48.9 weeks for AVD). The median relative 
dose intensity (RDI (%) (defined as 100 × (total dose received)/(total dose intended) was 99.5% 
(range 16.7% to 114.3%) for brentuximab vedotin, 100% (range 4.1% to 109.2%) for doxorubicin, 
99.1% (range 15.4% to 115.2%) for vinblastine, and 100% (range 66.0% to 111.9%) for 
dacarbazine.  
ABVD patients received a median of 6 treatment cycles (range 1 to 6 cycles) over a median of 24.0 
weeks for all 4 study drugs (range 2.0 to 39.1 weeks for bleomycin, and 2.0 to 45.4 weeks for AVD). A 
median RDI of 99.8% was reported for bleomycin (range 8.1% to 119.4%), a median RDI of 100% for 
doxorubicin (range 59.6% to 111.1%), a median RDI of 99.3% for vinblastine (range 9.3% to 
116.2%), and a median RDI of 100% (range 13.9% to 114.0%) for dacarbazine.  
Discontinuations, Dose Delays and Modifications 
The permanent discontinuation of study drug was attributed to brentuximab vedotin for 71 A+AVD 
patients (11%) and to bleomycin for 106 ABVD patients (16%) (Table 39). An adverse event led to the 
study drug discontinuation for A+AVD vs ABVD in 13% vs 16%. of patients. For the A+AVD patients, a 
slightly higher proportion of interventions were reported for brentuximab vedotin than for the other 3 
agents in the randomized regimen. Over the treatment duration, at least 1 action was reported for 
brentuximab vedotin in 66% of patients, 54% of patients who received doxorubicin, 57% of patients 
who received vinblastine, and 53% of patients who received dacarbazine. A study drug dose delay was 
the most frequently reported modification for the A+AVD patients (48% to 49% of patients for each 
drug) (Table 38). For the ABVD treatment arm, the highest proportion of interventions were reported 
for bleomycin. Over the treatment duration, at least 1 action was reported for 48% of patients who 
received bleomycin, 43% of patients who received vinblastine, 39% of patients who received 
dacarbazine, and 38% of patients who received doxorubicin (Table 38). A dose delay was the most 
frequently reported modification for ABVD patients (32% to 33% of patients for each drug), followed 
by premature and permanent study drug discontinuation and dose reduction.

Impact of G-CSF Primary Prophylaxis 
The use of G-CSFs according to institutional guidelines was allowed per protocol for the management 
of neutropenia. After enrolment of approximately 70% of the ECHELON-1 study population, the 
independent data monitoring committee recommended that patients randomized to the A+AVD 
treatment arm be given prophylactic growth factor support beginning with Cycle 1. For the purpose of 
assessing the impact of the G-CSF use on the safety profile, the sponsor defined G-CSF primary 
prophylaxis as G-CSF given by Day 5 of study treatment, where Day 1 is the treatment start date. By 
this definition, 83 patients in the A+AVD treatment arm and 43 patients in the ABVD treatment arm 
received G-CSF primary prophylaxis. 
For the A+AVD arm, no action pertaining to brentuximab vedotin was reported for 43% of patients 
who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis compared with 33% of patients who received no G-CSF 
primary prophylaxis. Fewer dose reductions (20% with prophylaxis vs 26% without prophylaxis) and 
dose delays (35% with prophylaxis vs 49% without prophylaxis) were reported across treatment arms 
for the subset of patients who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis (Table 39).

Exposure-Response Analysis Results and Relationship to Safety  
An exposure-response analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of overall time-averaged ADC 
and MMAE exposure on the incidence of Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy (PN), Grade 4 or 
higher neutropenia, febrile neutropenia of any grade, and Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) reported in the ECHELON-1 study. 
Concomitant medication 
At least 1 concomitant medication was reported for 659 patients (100%) in the A+AVD treatment arm 
and for 653 patients (99%) in the ABVD treatment arm. The most commonly reported concomitant 
medications (>25% of patients) for the A+AVD patients were ondansetron (73% of patients), 
filgrastim (61%), dexamethasone (58%), paracetamol (50%), allopurinol (42%), metoclopramide 
(29%), lorazepam (28%), and sodium chloride (26%). 
The most commonly reported concomitant medications (>25% of patients) for ABVD patients were 
ondansetron (75% of patients), dexamethasone (59%), paracetamol (50%), filgrastim (43%), 
allopurinol (42%), lorazepam (27%), palonosetron and metoclopramide (26% each), and Bactrim 
(trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) (25%). 
Myeloid growth factor usage was reported for a higher proportion of the A+AVD patients either as a 
concomitant medication or as secondary prophylaxis for neutropenia. At least 1 myeloid growth factor 
(immunostimulant) was reported for 536 A+AVD patients (81%) and 373 ABVD patients (57%) in the 
Safety population. Filgrastim was the most frequently reported growth factor for patients across 
treatment arms. Filgrastim usage was reported for 405 A+AVD patients (61%) and 286 ABVD patients 
(43%).

Deaths 
On-study deaths were defined as deaths that occurred within 30 days of the last dose of frontline 
therapy. Post treatment follow-up (PTFU) deaths were defined as deaths that occurred after 30 days of 
the last dose of frontline therapy. 
As of the 20 April 2017 cut-off for data analysis, 67 deaths were reported in the study. A total of 9 on-
study deaths were reported for the A+AVD patients and 13 on-study deaths for ABVD patients, and 19 
deaths for the A+AVD patients and 26 deaths for ABVD during PTFU.  
On-Study Deaths 
On-study death was reported for 9 A+AVD patients. All 9 patients who died on study received the 
randomized regimen only without a switch to an alternative frontline medication (AFM). The cause of 
death for these 9 patients was reported as myocardial infarction (2 patients), cardiorespiratory arrest, 
haematophagic histiocytosis, respiratory failure, death of unknown cause, multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome, neutropenic sepsis, and septic shock (1 patient each). The investigator considered the on-
study death of 8 A+AVD patients to be treatment related, and 7 deaths were associated with 
neutropenia and its complications, including neutropenic sepsis and septic shock. None of the A+AVD 
patients for whom on-study death was reported received G-CSF primary prophylaxis.  
Thirteen ABVD patients died on study. One of the 13 patients received an AFM after the Cycle 2 PET 
assessment. The cause of death for the 13 ABVD patients was reported as pneumonia (3 patients), 
Assessment report

cardiac arrest (2 patients), and Pneumocystis pneumonia, pulmonary toxicity, cardiopulmonary failure, 
pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory disorder, cerebrovascular 
accident (CVA), and an unknown cause (1 patient each). The investigator considered the on-study 
death of 7 ABVD patients to be treatment related, and the majority were associated with pulmonary-
related toxicity. 
Deaths during Post treatment Follow-Up 
The death of 19 A+AVD patients was reported between 31 days to 1186 days of the last dose of 
frontline therapy. None of these patients had switched to an AFM. Thirteen of these 19 patients 
completed 6 cycles of frontline therapy. The primary cause of death for 10 patients was reported as 
related to disease under study or associated complications. 
The 19 A+AVD patients who died during PTFU included 5 A+AVD patients who died within 120 days of 
the last dose of frontline therapy. The primary cause of death for these 5 A+AVD patients was reported 
as related to disease under study or complications thereof (reported as exacerbation of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease in the CIOMS report), intracerebral haemorrhage, intracranial 
haemorrhage, completed suicide, and AE (reported as soft tissue infection and sepsis in the CIOMS 
reports). According to the CIOMS reports, the investigator assessed the death of 2 A+AVD patients 
within 120 days of the last dose of frontline therapy to be related to SAEs reported during frontline 
therapy 
The death of 26 ABVD patients was reported between 40 days to 1075 days of the last dose of 
frontline therapy. Three patients had been switched to an AFM and died more than 300 days after their 
last dose of randomized therapy (309, 332, and 930 days, respectively). Seventeen of the 26 patients 
completed 6 cycles of frontline therapy. The primary cause of death was reported as related to primary 
disease or associated complications for 16 patients. The 26 ABVD patients included 6 ABVD patients 
who died within 120 days of the last dose of frontline therapy. The primary cause of death for these 6 
ABVD patients was reported as related to disease under study or associated complications (3 patients), 
Pneumocystis pneumonia, T-cell lymphoma, and bile duct cancer (pneumonia, Pneumocystis 
pneumonia, T-cell lymphoma, HL, pneumonitis, and bile duct cancer in the CIOMS reports). The 
investigator assessed the death of 4 ABVD patients within 120 days of the last dose of frontline 
therapy to be related to SAEs reported during frontline therapy.

Other Serious Adverse Events 
Table 45 Study C25003: Treatment-Emergent SAEs Reported for at Least 5 Patients 
in Either Treatment Arm by PT (Safety Population) 
At least 1 drug-related SAE was reported for 240 patients (36%) in the A+AVD treatment arm and 125 
patients (19%) in the ABVD treatment arm. The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs for the 
A+AVD patients were febrile neutropenia (17% of patients); pyrexia (6%); neutropenia (3%); and 
pneumonia, sepsis, abdominal pain, constipation, and vomiting (2% each). 
The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs for ABVD patients were febrile neutropenia (6% of 
patients), pyrexia (3%), and pneumonitis (2%). Grade 4 neutropenia and Grade 2 anaemia were 
reported as SAEs in error in the clinical database for 1 A+AVD patient each. The inclusion of these 2 
AEs in the overall SAE count was considered to have minimal impact on the reporting frequency of 
SAEs for the A+AVD treatment arm. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
Other significant AEs included the AEs that resulted in premature study drug discontinuation or a dose 
modification, defined as a dose delay or dose hold, dose reduction, and/or infusion interruption. A dose 
hold or dose delay was instituted according to institutional guidelines and /or investigator judgement.

TEAEs That Resulted in Study Drug Modification 
A dose modification was defined as a dose reduction, dose delay or dose hold of any drug in the 
randomized regimens, or an infusion interruption. A dose delay occurred when the scheduled dose of 
any drug in either regimen was given but not within the time frame specified by the protocol for that 
particular scheduled dosing day/cycle. A dose hold occurred when a planned or scheduled dose of any 
drug in either regimen was not given because of an intentional physician intervention as a result of a 
TEAE. 
A higher incidence of dose modifications was reported for the A+AVD treatment arm. At least 1 TEAE 
that resulted in a dose modification was reported for 423 patients (64%) in the A+AVD treatment arm 
and 293 patients (44%) in the ABVD treatment arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs that resulted 
in a dose modification for the A+AVD patients were neutropenia (22% of patients); febrile 
neutropenia; peripheral sensory neuropathy and PN (9% each); pyrexia (5%); and decreased 
neutrophil count, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), decreased weight, and PMN (3% each). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs that resulted in a dose modification for ABVD patients were 
neutropenia (15% of patients); febrile neutropenia (4%); peripheral sensory neuropathy; and 
decreased neutrophil count and pyrexia (3% each). A dose delay was the most frequently reported 
dose modification for patients across treatment arms. A higher percentage of dose reductions and dose 
delays was reported for the A+AVD patients, whereas a slightly higher proportion of dose interruptions 
was reported for ABVD patients. An AE resulted in dose reduction for 191 A+AVD patients (29%) and 
65 ABVD patients (10%), a dose delay for 318 A+AVD patients (48%) and 217 ABVD patients (33%), 
and a dose interruption for 22 A+AVD patients (3%) and 33 ABVD patients (5%).

Neutropenia 
Table 48 Study C25003: Neutropenia (Safety Population) 
Dose Modifications For Neutropenia 
Neutropenia resulted in at least 1 dose modification for 167 patients (25%) in the A+AVD treatment 
arm and 121 patients (18%) in the ABVD treatment arm. A dose delay was the most frequently 
reported modification instituted for neutropenia. Neutropenia resulted in at least 1 dose delay for 158 
A+AVD patients (24%) and 117 ABVD patients (18%), and at least 1 dose reduction for 14 A+AVD 
patients (2%) and 8 ABVD patients (1%). 
Infection Associated With Grade 3 or Grade 4 Neutropenia 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia was reported for 430 A+AVD patients (65%) and 317 ABVD patients 
(48%). At least 1 TEAE of any grade in the SOC Infections and infestations was reported for 145

A+AVD patients (22%) and 92 ABVD patients (14%) within 7 days of Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia. 
Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was the most frequently reported infection-related PT within 7 
days of Grade 3/4 neutropenia across treatment arms. URTI was reported for 28 A+AVD patients 
(4%); nasopharyngitis and pneumonia for 13 patients each, oral candidiasis for 12 patients, and 
pharyngitis for 11 patients (2% each). URTI was reported for 23 ABVD patients (3%) and 
nasopharyngitis for 12 ABVD patients (2%). 
Febrile Neutropenia 
Treatment-emergent febrile neutropenia of any grade was reported for 128 patients (19%) in the 
A+AVD treatment arm and 52 patients (8%) in the ABVD treatment arm. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia 
was reported for 89 A+AVD patients (13%) and 39 ABVD patients (6%), and Grade 4 febrile 
neutropenia for 39 A+AVD patients (6%) and 13 ABVD patients (2%). Febrile neutropenia was 
reported as an SAE for 114 A+AVD patients (17%) and 43 ABVD patients (7%). Grade 5 febrile 
neutropenia was not reported for either treatment arm. Febrile neutropenia resulted in at least 1 dose 
modification for 60 patients (9%) in the A+AVD treatment arm and 25 patients (4%) in the ABVD 
treatment arm. This included at least 1 dose delay for 56 A+AVD patients (8%) and 23 ABVD patients 
(3%), and a dose reduction for 8 A+AVD patients (1%) and 5 ABVD patients (<1%). 
The highest frequency of febrile neutropenia was reported during Cycle 1 for both treatment arms 
(Figure 36). During Cycle 1, treatment-emergent febrile neutropenia was reported for 62 A+AVD 
patients (9%) and 26 ABVD patients (4%). Thereafter, the frequency of febrile neutropenia declined 
for patients in both treatment arms, and ranged from 9% during Cycle 1 to 1% during Cycle 6 for the 
A+AVD patients and from 4% during Cycle 1 to <1% during Cycle 6 for ABVD patients.

Population) 
Potential Risk Factors for Febrile Neutropenia 
An assessment was performed of the role of selected potential risk factors for febrile neutropenia. 
Assessed risk factors included age groups (<60 years and ≥60 years), sex, disease stage (Ann Arbor 
Stage III or Stage IV), bone marrow involvement, extranodal involvement at initial diagnosis, and 
haemoglobin value at baseline. Among the potential risk factors evaluated, advanced age was the only 
risk factor identified for febrile neutropenia. 
Impact of G-CSF Primary Prophylaxis on Febrile Neutropenia and Other Safety Endpoints 
The IDMC recommended the use of growth factor as prophylaxis after 70% of patients were enrolled in 
the study. G-CSF primary prophylaxis was defined as G-CSF given by Day 5 of study treatment. By 
this definition, 83 A+AVD patients and 43 ABVD patients received G CSF primary prophylaxis. Febrile 
neutropenia at any time during treatment was reported for 9 A+AVD patients (11%) who received G-
CSF primary prophylaxis compared with 119 patients (21%) who received no G-CSF primary

prophylaxis. Febrile neutropenia during Cycle 1 was reported for 1 A+AVD patient (1%) who received 
G-CSF primary prophylaxis compared with 61 A+AVD patients (11%) who received no G-CSF primary 
prophylaxis. Grade 3 or higher Infections and infestations (SOC) were reported for 9 A+AVD patients 
(11%) who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis compared with 107 A+AVD patients (18%) who 
received no G-CSF primary prophylaxis. Neutropenia of any grade was reported for 29 A+AVD patients 
(35%) who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis and 425 A+AVD patients (73%) who received no G-
CSF primary prophylaxis. Grade 3 or higher neutropenia was reported for 24 A+AVD patients (29%) 
who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis compared with 406 A+AVD patients (70%) who received no 
G-CSF primary prophylaxis. SAEs of febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, 
pyrexia, and infection-related TEAEs were reported for 20 A+AVD patients (24%) who received G-CSF 
primary prophylaxis compared with 190 A+AVD patients (33%) who received no G-CSF primary 
prophylaxis. The frequency of Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, infections, Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, and 
SAEs was also lower for the subgroup of 43 ABVD patients who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis 
than the subgroup who received no G-CSF primary prophylaxis. 
Kaplan-Meier plots of mPFS by treatment arm and G-CSF use were produced to assess the impact of 
G-CSF prophylaxis on mPFS.

As assessed by Cox regression analysis, the unstratified hazard ratio was 0.308 (95% CI, 0.210; 
0.453), showing a 69% risk reduction in treatment-emergent neutropenia for patients who received G-
CSF primary prophylaxis compared with the patients who received no G-CSF primary prophylaxis. 
Treatment-emergent neutropenia was reported for an estimated 34% of the A+AVD patients who 
received G-CSF primary prophylaxis compared with 73% of patients in the same treatment arm who 
received no G-CSF primary prophylaxis. At 1 month, an estimated 83% of patients who received G-
CSF primary prophylaxis (95% CI,73.0, 89.5; [No of patients at risk=68]) were free of treatment-
emergent neutropenia compared with 38% of patients who received no G-CSF primary prophylaxis 
(95% CI, 34.1; 42.0; [No. of patients at risk=219]). 
Peripheral Neuropathy 
At least 1 PN event of any grade within the PN (SMQ) was reported for 442 patients (67%) in the 
A+AVD treatment arm and 286 patients (43%) in the ABVD treatment arm. At least 1 PN event within 
the Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy (SSQ) was reported for 429 patients (65%) in the A+AVD 
treatment arm and 273 patients (41%) in the ABVD treatment arm. The most frequently reported PN 
PTs (≥5%) of any grade for the A+AVD patients were peripheral sensory neuropathy (29% of 
patients), PN (26%), paraesthesia (13%), PMN (6%), and muscular weakness (5%). The most 
frequently reported PN PTs of any grade for ABVD patients were peripheral sensory neuropathy (17% 
of patients), PN (13%), paraesthesia (11%), and hypoesthesia (5%). PN (SMQ) events included at 
least 1 Grade 3 PN event reported for 69 patients (10%) in the A+AVD treatment arm and 11 patients 
(2%) in the ABVD treatment arm. The most frequently reported Grade 3 PN events for the A+AVD 
patients were peripheral sensory neuropathy (5% of patients), PN (4%), and PMN (2%). The most 
frequently reported Grade 3 PN events for ABVD patients were peripheral sensory neuropathy and PN 
(<1% each). 
Only 1 Grade 4 PN (SMQ) event was reported in the study. Grade 4 polyneuropathy, Grade 4 
neurological infection, and Grade 5 respiratory failure were reported for 1 A+AVD patient at Cycle 3 
Day 15. This patient was 1 of the 9 on-study deaths reported for the A+AVD treatment arm. 
Autonomic neuropathy was reported for 1 A+AVD patient and for 2 ABVD patients (<1%). Grade 2 
autonomic neuropathy was reported for the A+AVD patient and Grade 2 and Grade 3 autonomic

A dose reduction was the most frequently reported modification for a PN (SMQ) event across treatment 
arms. Among the patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent PN (SMQ) event, at least 1 dose 
reduction was reported for 138 A+AVD patients (31%) and 32 ABVD patients (11%), and at least 1 
dose delay for 7 A+AVD patients (2%) and 3 ABVD patients (1%). 
Among the patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent PN (SMQ) event, premature study drug 
discontinuation was reported for 44 A+AVD patients (10%) and 11 ABVD patients (4%). The A+AVD 
patients received a median of 8 doses (range 2 to 12 doses) and ABVD patients, a median of 5 doses 
(range 1 to 11 doses) of study treatment before PN resulted in premature study drug discontinuation. 
Among patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent PN (SMQ) event of any grade, first onset was 
reported at a median of 8.0 weeks (range 0 to 29 weeks) for the A+AVD patients and at a median of 
7.0 weeks (range 0 to 32 weeks) for ABVD patients. First onset of the highest grade PN event was 
reported at a median of 12.0 weeks (range 0 to 29 weeks) for the A+AVD patients and at a median of 
8.0 weeks (range 0 to 32 weeks) for ABVD patients. 
Among patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy in the pivotal phase 2 studies and randomized 
phase 3 studies 82-85% had resolution or improvement of their peripheral neuropathy symptoms at 
the time of last evaluation with the median follow up time ranging from 48.9 to 98 weeks 
(approximately 13 to 25 months). In the phase 3 AETHERA study, 85% of patients who experienced 
PN had resolution or improvement of the PN at last follow-up with a median follow-up of 98 weeks 
(approximately 25 months). 
In ECHELON-1, 76% of patients reported improvement or resolution of PN at the slightly longer follow-
up of 31 months with the vast majority of remaining peripheral neuropathy events Grade 1 or Grade 2 
in severity. Time to PN onset differences were observed between ECHELON-1 and AETHERA. In the 
AETHERA study, for the patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm who had at least 1 event of PN, the 
median time to first onset of any grade was 13.7 weeks (range 0.1 to 47.4)). In ECHELON-1, among 
patients with at least 1 treatment emergent PN (SMQ) event of any grade, first onset was reported at 
a median of 8.0 weeks (range 0 to 29 weeks) for the A+AVD patients. 
Resolution or Improvement of PMN 
Among patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent PMN (SSQ) event, resolution or improvement was 
reported for 30 A+AVD patients (41%) and 21 ABVD patients (72%) at EOT, and for 45 A+AVD 
patients (61%) and 23 ABVD patients (79%) at the time of last follow-up. At EOT, PMN was reported 
to be ongoing for 48 A+AVD patients (65%) and 8 ABVD patients (28%). Among the 48 A+AVD 
patients with ongoing PMN at EOT, Grade 3 was reported for 11 patients (15%), Grade 2 for 20 
patients (27%), and Grade 1 for 17 patients (23%). For the8 ABVD patients with ongoing PMN at EOT, 
Grade 2 was reported for 1 patient (3%) and Grade 1 for 7 patients (24%).  
At the time of last follow-up, PMN was reported to be ongoing for 39 A+AVD patients (53%) and 6 
ABVD patients (21%). Among the 39 A+AVD patients with ongoing PMN at the time of last follow-up, 
Grade 3 was reported for 7 patients (9%), Grade 2 for 13 patients (18%), and Grade 1 for 19 patients 
(26%). For the 6 ABVD patients with ongoing PMN at the time of last follow-up, Grade 2 was reported 
for 1 patient (3%) and Grade 1 for 5 patients (17%). At the time of last follow-up, PMN was reported 
to be resolved for 10 A+AVD patients (14%)and 2 ABVD patients (7%) who had ongoing PMN at EOT. 
For these patients, resolution of PMN was reported at a median of 24.5 weeks (range 0 to 65 weeks) 
from EOT for the A+AVD patients and at a median of 13.0 weeks (range 4 to 22 weeks) from EOT for 
ABVD patients. Among patients with at least 1 PMN (SSQ) event of any grade, resolution was reported 
at a median of 7.0 weeks (range 0 to 123 weeks) from time of first onset for the A+AVD patients and 
at a median of 2.0 weeks (range 0 to 36 weeks) from the time of first onset for ABVD patients.

Pulmonary Toxicity 
A comprehensive review was performed of MedDRA PTs under the interstitial lung disease (ILD). The 
PTs identified from the ILD SMQ broad review were lung infiltration, pneumonitis, ILD, ARDS, 
organizing pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary toxicity. At least 1 treatment-emergent ILD 
(SMQ) event of any grade was reported for 12 patients (2%) in the A+AVD treatment arm and 44 
patients (7%) in the ABVD treatment arm. The ILD events of any grade reported for the A+AVD 
patients were lung infiltration and pneumonitis, reported for 6 patients each and ILD, reported for 1 
patient (<1% each). The most frequently reported ILD events of any grade for ABVD patients were 
pneumonitis, reported for 18 patients (3%), pulmonary toxicity for 16 patients (2%), and ILD for 6 
patients (<1%). At least 1 Grade 3 or higher ILD event was reported for 5 A+AVD patients (<1%) and 
21 ABVD patients (3%), including 3 ABVD patients with a Grade 5 (fatal) ILD event. Grade 4 lung 
infiltration and Grade 3 pneumonitis were reported for 2 A+AVD patients each (<1%). No Grade 5 ILD 
event was reported for the A+AVD patients. Grade 3 or higher pneumonitis was reported for 9 ABVD 
patients and Grade 3 or higher pulmonary toxicity for 7 ABVD patients (1% each). Grade 5 
pneumonitis, ARDS, and pulmonary toxicity were reported for 1 ABVD patient each. An ILD event was 
reported as an SAE for 5 A+AVD patients (<1%) and 21 ABVD patients (3%). Lung infiltration and 
pneumonitis were reported as an SAE for 2 A+AVD patients each and ILD was reported as an SAE for 1 
A+AVD patient. Pneumonitis was reported as an SAE for 12 ABVD patients (2%) and pulmonary 
toxicity was reported as an SAE for 5 ABVD patients (<1%). 
A higher frequency of ILD (SMQ) events was reported for the ABVD treatment (44 (7%) versus 12 
(2%)) and ILD events were associated with severe clinical outcomes including on-study death and 
premature study drug discontinuation. An ILD event resulted in the premature study drug 
discontinuation for 3 A+AVD patients (<1%) and 24 ABVD patients (4%), a dose delay for 7 A+AVD 
patients and 9 ABVD patients (1% each), and a dose hold for 1 A+AVD patient and 3 ABVD patients 
(<1% each). 
Among patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent ILD (SMQ) event, first onset was reported at a 
median of 16.0 weeks (range 1 to 21 weeks) for the A+AVD patients and 17.5 weeks (range 0 to 38 
weeks) for ABVD patients. First onset of the highest grade ILD event was reported at a median of 16.5 
weeks (range 1 to 21 weeks) for the A+AVD patients and 19.5 weeks (range 0 to 38 weeks) for ABVD 
patients. 
Comparison of Pulmonary Toxicity in ECHELON-1 Versus Historical Reports for ABVD 
In ECHELON-1, pulmonary-related toxicity, including more severe and fatal events, was reported for a 
higher proportion of ABVD patients than A+AVD patients. Among other studies that included patients 
with HL who received ABVD as frontline therapy, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity varied 
considerably, ranging from 0%, 10%, and 15%, respectively (Jalali. et al., Ann. Hemtology 2016; 
Gobbi et al., JCO 2005; Huskin et al., JCO 2009). The incidence of Grade 3 or higher pulmonary 
toxicity ranged from <1% to 24.5% in 6 other studies that included patients with HL who received 
ABVD as frontline therapy. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity was assessed using the following 4 MedDRA SMQs, identical to those used in the 
ADCETRIS European Risk Management plan: 
- Cholestasis and jaundice of hepatic origin SMQ, Broad. 
- Hepatic failure, fibrosis and cirrhosis and other liver damage-related conditions SMQ, Broad. 
- Hepatitis, non-infectious SMQ, Broad.

Immunogenicity 
The presence of anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) to brentuximab vedotin was determined for 
patients in the A+AVD treatment arm and patients with a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline 
assessment for ATA were categorized as either ATA negative, transiently positive, or persistently 
positive. Patients who were confirmed to be ATA positive post baseline were also tested for the 
presence of neutralizing anti-therapeutic antibodies (nATA). 
A total of 632 patients of the 662 patients in the A+AVD treatment arm had a baseline and at least 1 
post-baseline assessment for ATA (Safety population - Immunogenicity-evaluable patients).  
- At baseline, 568 A+AVD patients (90%) were ATA negative and 64 patients (10%) were confirmed to 
be ATA positive. A total of 523 A+AVD patients (83%) who had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline 
assessment were ATA negative, and 109 A+AVD patients (17%) were confirmed to be ATA positive at 
1 or more post-baseline assessments.  
- Four A+AVD patients (4%) were persistently ATA positive, including 2 patients who were ATA 
negative at baseline, and 2 patients who were ATA positive at the baseline. A total of 105 A+AVD 
patients (96%) were transiently ATA positive, including 77 patients (73%) who were ATA negative at 
baseline and confirmed to be ATA positive after administration of brentuximab vedotin and 28 patients 
(27%) were confirmed to be ATA positive at baseline and post-baseline assessments.  
An ATA titer was reported for 108 of the 109 A+AVD patients who were ATA positive at any post-
baseline assessment. Titer status was missing or unknown for 1 patient (1%). A high titer was defined 
as maximum titer of >25 among all confirmed positive post-baseline assessments and a low titer was 
defined as a maximum titer of ≤25 among all confirmed positive post-baseline assessments. Among 
the 108 A+AVD patients for whom titer was measured, a high titer was reported for 2 A+AVD patients 
(2%) and a low titer for 106 A+AVD patients (97%). 
Among the A+AVD patients, at least 1 IRR was reported for 42 ATA-negative patients (8%), and for 13 
transiently ATA-positive patients (12%); 10 of the 13 patients  were ATA negative at baseline and 3 
patients were confirmed ATA positive at baseline No IRRs were reported for the 4 A+AVD patients 
(<1%) who were persistently ATA positive. An IRR was reported at Cycle 1 for 4 A+AVD patients (6%) 
who were ATA positive and 28 A+AVD patients (5%) who were ATA negative at baseline.

Neutropenia 
Advanced age was identified as a risk factor for febrile neutropenia in patients with advanced cHL who 
received A+AVD or ABVD. Higher incidence of febrile neutropenia was reported across treatment arms 
for older patients. Febrile neutropenia was reported for 97 A+AVD patients (17%) in the subset aged 
<60 years compared with 31 A+AVD patients (37%) in the subset aged ≥60 years, and for 35 ABVD 
patients (6%) in the subset aged <60 years compared with 17 ABVD patients (17%) in the subset 
aged ≥60 years. Within the age groups 60 years to <70 years and 70 years to <80 years, the 
incidence of febrile neutropenia was 33% and 44% for the A+AVD patients and 9% and 26%, 
respectively for ABVD patients. Febrile neutropenia was not reported for the 1 A+AVD patient ≥80 
years and was reported for all 3 ABVD patients (100%) ≥80 years.  
An assessment was undertaken of the impact of G-CSF primary prophylaxis on safety outcomes for 
older patients. Ten of the 83 A+AVD patients (12%) and 9 of 43 ABVD patients (21%) who received G-
CSF primary prophylaxis in the study were aged 60 years or older. Although a small number of 
patients aged 60 years or older received G-CSF primary prophylaxis, a trend of improved safety 
outcomes was noted across treatment arms for these patients compared with those in the same age 
group who received no G-CSF primary prophylaxis. 
Pulmonary related toxicity 
Advanced age was identified as a risk factor for pulmonary-related toxicity in patients who received 
ABVD. The results of an analysis of the incidence of pulmonary-related toxicity for the 2 treatment 
arms categorized by age showed a higher incidence of ILD (SMQ) events for ABVD patients older than 
65 years. No correlation was noted between age and the frequency of ILD events for the A+AVD 
patients. 
At least 1 ILD (SMQ) event of any grade was reported for 12 patients (2%) in the A+AVD treatment 
arm. This included at least 1 ILD event of any grade for 9 A+AVD patients (2%) in the age range <45 
years, 2 A+AVD patients (1%) in the age range of 45 years to 65 years, and 1 A+AVD patient (2%) 
older than 65 years. Lung infiltration was the only ILD event reported for the subset of the 53 A+AVD 
patients older than 65 years.  
At least 1 ILD (SMQ) event of any grade was reported for 44 patients (7%) in the ABVD treatment 
arm. This included at least 1 ILD event of any grade for 18 ABVD patients (4%) in the age range <45 
years, 14 ABVD patients (7%) in the age range of 45 years to 65 years, and 12 ABVD patients (23%) 
older than 65 years. Among the 53 ABVD patients older than 65 years, at least 1 ILD event was 
reported for 12 patients (23%), including at least 1 Grade 3 or higher ILD event for 6 patients (11%), 
and a Grade 5 (fatal) ILD event for 1 patient (2%). The most commonly reported ILD events of any 
grade for ABVD patients older than 65 years were pulmonary toxicity, reported for 6 patients (11%), 
pneumonitis, reported for 3 patients (6%), and pulmonary fibrosis, reported for 2 patients (4%). An 
ILD event was reported as an SAE for 3 ABVD patients (6%) older than 65 years.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety results are presented as of 20 April 2017 cut-off for data analysis. The Safety population 
consisted of 662 patients in the A+AVD treatment arm and 659 patients in the ABVD treatment arm. 
The safety cohort is sufficient for assessment of the safety profile in combination with AVD. 
Both A+AVD and ABVD were administered IV on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in both 
treatment arms could receive up to 6 cycles of study treatment. A median of 6 cycles (range 1 to 6 
cycles) was reported for both treatment arms, administered over a similar m 
edian duration of approximately 24 weeks (range 2.0 to 48.9 weeks). Approximately 95% of patients 
in both treatment arms completed the protocol-defined study treatment, e.g. the relative dose 
intensity, duration of treatment, and number of maximum completed cycles of individual regimen 
components was similar between treatment arms. 
The studied population consisted of a fit first line HL population with advanced disease (36% stadium 
III and 64% stadium IV). The initial time since diagnosis was <1 month in both arms, median age was 
35 years (A+AVD) vs 37 years (ABVD) and the majority of patients had nodular sclerosis classical HL 
(~61%), with Ann Arbor Stage IV at diagnosis (~63%). The majority of patients had at least 2 IPFP 
risk factors (~78%), and an ECOG performance score of 0 (57%) or 1 (39%). The majority of patients 
had no bone marrow involvement (76%), and no B symptoms (75%) and 33% no extra-nodal sites 
involved. The baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms.  
In the ECHELON-1 trial almost all patients experienced 1 TEAE of any grade in both treatment arms 
(99% A+AVD vs 98% ABVD). At least 1 grade 3 or higher TEAE was reported for 83% in A+AVD and 
66% in the ABVD arm and at least 1 drug-related SAE for 240 A+AVD patient (36%) and for 125 ABVD 
patients (19%). The higher toxicity of the A+AVD regimen is also reflected in the medical resource 
utilization, which was slightly higher in the A+AVD arm (36% vs. 28% in the ABVD arm). The 
combination of A+AVD had a safety profile consistent with that of each drug individually with respect 
to the nature of TEAEs and SAEs observed. No new important risks were identified. The most common 
reported TEAE in both regimens were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, diarrhoea, 
peripheral neuropathy, decreased weight, abdominal pain, anaemia, febrile neutropenia, and bone 
pain. The AE profile resulted in the use of an anti-emetic as concomitant medication in approximately 
75% of the cases in both arms.  
As of the 20 April 2017 cut-off for data analysis, a total of 67 deaths were reported in the study. This 
included 9 on-study deaths for the A+AVD treatment arm, 8 of which were considered treatment-
related, and 13 on-study deaths for the ABVD treatment arm, 7 of which were considered treatment-
related. On-study deaths for the majority of the A+AVD patients were reported during Cycle 1 and 
were related to neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and its associated complications, including infections, 
sepsis and septic shock, none of these patients had received G-CSF prophylaxis. The majority of on-
study deaths for ABVD patients were reported during Cycle 5 or Cycle 6, and were related to 
pulmonary toxicity, which is a known risk factor of bleomycine.  
An AE resulting in a dose modification was more often reported for A+AVD then ABVD (64% vs 44%). 
Dose delay was the most frequently reported dose modification for patients across treatment arms. An 
AE resulted in premature study drug discontinuation for 88 A+AVD patients (13%) and 105 ABVD 
patients (16%). Neuropathy-related and toxicity and febrile neutropenia accounted for the majority of 
premature study drug discontinuations reported for A+AVD patients, whereas pulmonary-related 
toxicity accounted for the majority of discontinuations for ABVD patients.  
Adverse events of clinical interest 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 104/121 
 
 
 
The results of the special adverse events of interest (febrile neutropenia and infection, PN, and 
pulmonary-related toxicity, hepatotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, hyperglycaemia, infections 
and secondary malignancies) showed for all AESIs a higher rate in A+AVD arm versus the ABVD arm, 
both overall as well as drug-related. For secondary primary malignancies (SPM), to date the rate of 
SPM is low and similar across arms (1.5% A+AVD and 2% ABVD) although the follow up time is too 
short to draw definitive conclusions. Data from the 10 year extension of the ECHELON-1 study will be 
needed to assess the rate of SPM (see RMP). Treatment-emergent neutropenia (PTs of neutropenia 
and decreased neutrophil count) of any grade was often reported in both arms (69% A+AVD and 55% 
ABVD). In the A+AVD arm neutropenia was more frequently reported as grade 4 and the highest 
incidence of febrile neutropenia was reported during Cycle 1 for both treatment arms. Upper 
respiratory tract infection (URTI) was the most frequently reported infection-related PT within 7 days 
of Grade 3/4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia across treatment arms, but there was no remarkable 
difference between the treatments. After approximately 70% of enrollment was completed study 
physicians were sent a letter recommending primary prophylaxis with G-CSF in accordance with the 
international guidelines for neutropenia management. When comparing the safety profile of patients 
with and without G-CSF for both treatment arms a decrease of adverse events is observed. G-CSF 
primary prophylaxis was defined as G-CSF given by Day 5 of study treatment. By this definition, 83 
A+AVD patients and 43 ABVD patients received G-CSF primary prophylaxis.  
Introducing G-CSF prophylaxis resulted in fewer dose reductions and dose delays as shown by 
comparing G-CSF (n= 83) and no G-CSF prophylaxis (n= 579) for patients in the A+AVD arm, even 
though with prophylaxis 35% of the patients still required a dose delay, 20% a dose reduction and 
10% discontinued permanently with brentuximab vedotin. As expected, G-CSF prophylaxis declined 
the incidence of neutropenia (69% risk reduction in treatment-emergent neutropenia) and associated 
complications of febrile neutropenia and infection, but a higher frequency of bone pain (a known side 
effect of G-CSF) was reported (see SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4).  
Prophylactic treatment of G-CSF was observed to lead to improved tolerability of treatment regimen 
which might lead to less dose reductions and subsequently to higher exposure to the treatment 
regimen. As more patients in the A+AVD arm received G-CSF prophylaxis it could be assumed that 
efficacy results for these might thus be hampered due to the addition of G-CSF and the small number 
of events in the prophylaxis arm (11 patients with A+AVD and 14 ABVD). G-CSF prophylaxis seemed 
to have an impact on efficacy outcomes - although not statistically significant. G-CSF prophylaxis is 
recommended for all patients (see SmPC section 4.4). In ECHELON-1, pulmonary-related toxicity, 
including more severe and fatal events, was reported for a higher proportion of ABVD patients than 
A+AVD patients. Advanced age was identified as a potential risk factor for pulmonary-related toxicity 
for patients treated with ABVD. The most frequently reported TEAEs that resulted in premature study 
drug discontinuation for ABVD patients were dyspnoea (4% of patients); pulmonary toxicity, cough, 
and decreased carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (2% each); and pneumonitis (1%). The death of 7 
ABVD patients was considered to be treatment-related according to the investigator assessment, and 
the majority of these deaths was associated with pulmonary-related toxicity. A higher frequency of ILD 
(SMQ) events was reported for the ABVD treatment and ILD events were associated with severe 
clinical outcomes including on-study death and premature study drug discontinuation. Altogether these 
findings confirm the already known toxicity profile of the ABVD treatment.  
PN was a clinically important side effect for patients in both treatment arms and was reported for a 
higher proportion of the A+AVD patients; PN (SMQ) event of any grade was reported for 67% A+AVD 
patients and 43% ABVD patients. Most PN (SMQ) events were either Grade 1 or Grade 2. At least 1 
Grade 3 PN event was reported for 10% of the A+AVD patients and for 2% of the ABVD patients. 
Grade 4 polyneuropathy was the only Grade 4 PN event reported in the study and was reported for 1 
A+AVD patient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 105/121 
 
 
 
Peripheral sensory neuropathy accounted for the highest proportion of PN (SMQ) events across 
treatment arms. At least 1 dose reduction for PN was reported for 138 A+AVD patients (31%) and 32 
ABVD patients (11%). PN resulted in premature study drug discontinuation for 44 A+AVD patients and 
11 ABVD patients. Resolution or improvement was reported for 51% patients A+AVD and 61% ABVD 
patients at EOT and for 67% A+AVD patients and 75% ABVD patients at the time of the last follow-up 
assessment.  
The incidence of PN in ECHELON-1 was similar to the monotherapy trials AETHERA and ALCANZA (each 
67%). For patients in ECHELON-1 the median onset of PN was earlier (8 weeks vs. 12-14 weeks in 
monotherapy). The median time to resolution or improvement in the A+AVD arm was shorter (14.5 
weeks vs 16-23 weeks) compared to monotherapy. However, a higher number of patients had ongoing 
Grade 2 and 3 events at last follow-up compared to monotherapy with brentuximab vedotin. 
Resolution or improvement of PN was reported for 335 A+AVD patients (76%) with a median follow-up 
duration of 133 weeks (approximately 31 months. Comparing these data with the studies SG035-0003, 
SG035-0004, AETHERA [SGN35-005], and ALCANZA [C25001]) 82-85% had resolution or 
improvement of their peripheral neuropathy symptoms at the time of last evaluation with the median 
follow up time ranging from 48.9 to 98 weeks. Dose, schedule and concomitant use of vinblastine 
could potentially be factors contributing to the somewhat lower incidence and shorter time to onset. 
Guidance is provided in the SmPC with respect to dosing recommendations in case of PN (see SmPC 
section 4.2). 
This incidence of ATA was similar to that observed in the Pivotal Phase 2 Population as well as that 
observed in the ALCANZA study. Overall, in the A+AVD treatment arm, there was no association 
between ATA or nATA status and response. Infusion related reactions (IRRs) occur in patients 9% of 
the patients treated with A+AVD, which is lower than the previous study in HL (AETHERA study (15%). 
Currently premedication is only administered in patients with prior infusion-related reactions. IRRs that 
resulted in a dose modification were reported for a higher proportion in the ABVD treatment arm (5% 
versus 2%). For patients in the A+AVD treatment arm no correlation was identified between the 
patient’s ATA or nATA status and the incidence of IRRs. The included safety information in the SmPC 
section 4.4 is considered sufficient. 
Fewer on-study deaths occurred among patients age >60 years on the A+AVD arm versus the ABVD 
arm. In both treatment arms, a higher percentage of patients age 60 years or older had dose 
modifications, including dose delays, dose reductions, and dose discontinuations. The overall incidence 
of TEAEs in patients age 60 years or older was generally similar across treatment arms. The incidence 
of febrile neutropenia was higher among patients age >60 years versus patients < 60 years in both 
treatment arms. G-CSF prophylaxis reduced the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients aged ≥60 
years in both treatment arms. A comparison of effect size for patients aged <60 and ≥60 years is 
however not possible due to the small number of patients. 
The incidence of ILDs was higher in the subgroup of patients aged >65 years in the ABVD arm (N=1 vs 
N=12).   
The Applicant performed subgroup analysis for Stage IV and extranodal sites>1 analysis. A+AVD 
treatment shows a distinct safety profile than ABVD. The type of AEs, SAEs, TEAEs was comparable 
across the Safety Population and do not differ with the presence of extranodal disease or disease 
staging (III/IV). No new risks were identified in these subgroups. Patients with stage III disease have 
more drug discontinuations compared to stage IV and the ITT population (mainly neuropathy and 
neutropenia as reason- 19% A+AVD stage III versus 10% A+AVD stage IV patients with both stage III 
and IV 16% for ABVD). There were more SAEs in stage III group compared to stage IV (48% vs 40%) 
and compared to stage IV fewer neutropenia ≥Grade 3 AEs, drug-related neutropenias overall and 
Grade 3 were observed. Grade 4 was comparable between the subgroups. No apparent difference is 
Assessment report

noted for treatment emergent febrile neutropenia. More subjects with stage III disease had resolution 
of peripheral neuropathy and fewer ongoing events compared to stage IV. Altogether it appears as 
though the stage III patients experienced slightly more toxicity then stage IV patients.  
For ABVD patients management of pulmonary toxicity by bleomycine can in part be managed by the 
introduction of a PET guided approach for discontinuation of bleomycine after a negative PET after 2 
cycles (Johnson et al, 2016) reducing its toxicity without affecting PFS. This approach was not 
incorporated in the design of the ECHELON-1 study which is unfortunate but due to the timing of the 
guidelines and start of the ECHELON-1 study understood. However, the toxicity of the ABVD treatment 
in the trial with respect to pulmonary toxicity might be overestimated compared to current clinical 
practice.  
The incidence in TEAE in stage IV elderly patients was similar in A+AVD versus ABVD. Elderly patients 
require more dose modifications, however this also holds true for the ABVD arm. Elderly patients have 
an increased risk for febrile neutropenia with the A+AVD treatment. Only a small proportion of patients 
>60 years had received prophylaxis in the pivotal trial. 
All relevant safety information has been included in the updated SmPC (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, no new safety concerns have been identified with A+AVD treatment.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
- Submission of regular updates/ final report from the 10-year extension of the ECHELON-1 trial. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 15, in response to comments made in the previous round 
of assessment. The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 15 is acceptable.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
The MAH provided justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on 
the package leaflet. The changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require user 
consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication is for adult patients with previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) 
in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In patients who present with advanced disease, 30-40% relapse within 5 years after initial treatment 
or have immediate treatment failure. A substantial proportion of patients with relapsed or refractory HL 
are not eligible for ASCT, cannot be cured by ASCT, or are still subject to late ASCT-related 
complications. This indicates the need for more effective first line treatments with manageable toxicity 
profiles. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Main evidence to support this extension of the indication is obtained from pivotal Phase 3, randomized, 
open-label Study ECHELON-1 (C25003). This study compared the modified progression-free survival 
(mPFS) obtained with brentuximab vedotin + AVD (Adcetris plus doxorubicin [Adriamycin], vinblastine 
and dacarbazine, abbreviated A+ AVD) versus that obtained with ABVD (doxorubicin [Adriamycin], 
bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) as frontline treatment for adult patients with CD30+ stadium 
III/IV HL. Primary endpoint was mPFS. A subgroup analysis was performed for patients with Stage IV 
HL and no or 1 or more sites of extranodal HL. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint mPFS per IRF based on the ITT population, as reported after 263 mPFS events 
(117 mPFS events in the A+AVD arm and 146 mPFS events in the ABVD arm) at the 20 April 2017 
data cut-off, was met. A+AVD was associated with a 23.0% reduction in the risk of an mPFS event 
versus ABVD (stratified HR=0.770; 95% CI, 0.603-0.983, p=0.035).  
The mPFS effect was consistent across several sensitivity analyses. A pre-specified analysis of mPFS by 
disease stage showed that patients with stage IV disease may experience more benefit of A+AVD. 
A+AVD patients with Stage III HL or no sites of extranodal HL seemed to have smaller efficacy effects 
relative to ABVD than seen in the ITT and in stage IV patients. Of the ITT population, 846 patients 
(63%) had Stage IV disease. There were no relevant differences in the patient and disease 
characteristics at baseline between the two arms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 114/121 
 
 
 
The key secondary endpoint OS showed no evidence of a survival advantage or disadvantage for 
A+AVD compared to ABVD in the ITT (stratified HR 0.728, 95% CI, 0.448; 1.184, p=0.199) at the 
interim analysis. For stage IV patients an advantage of A+AVD over ABVD was observed (HR= 0.51 
(95% CI [0.27, 0.97], p-value=0.037).  
Other secondary efficacy endpoints including CR rate and ORR at the end of randomization regimen, 
CR rate at the end of first-line therapy, and the rate of PET negativity at the end of Cycle 2, duration of 
response (DOR), duration of complete remission (DOCR), disease-free survival (DFS) and event-free 
survival (EFS), all had a trend in favour of A + AVD in both the ITT and Stage IV population. 
Elderly patients with stage IV HL have a trend towards a slightly favourable mPFS treated with A+AVD 
versus ABVD mPFS per IRF: HR age ≥60 = 0.804 (95% CI: 0.42 to 1.53), p = 0.506 and HR for age 
≥65 = 0.777 (95% CI: 0.36 to 1.67), p = 0.515). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Median mPFS and OS were not yet reached in either treatment arm. Update of mPFS results will not be 
provided, which limits the precision of the mPFS data for the subgroups due to the current high 
censoring rates and low event rates. OS data are very immature (Stage III 14 events (6%) A+AVD, 12 
events (5%) ABVD; Stage IV; A+AVD 14, ABVD 26 events ). Final analysis of OS data will be 
performed after 112 deaths have occurred.  
Efficacy of retreatment with brentuximab vedotin after ASCT is uncertain. From previous studies it is 
known that retreatment with brentuximab vedotin after ASCT is still effective. With the current 
proposed indication, brentuximab vedotin could in theory be considered three times during the course 
of the disease (frontline, after ASCT if at increased risk of relapse, and at relapse after ASCT), with 
unknown efficacy. The amendment of the ECHELON-1 study to include an extension of 10 year will be 
able to provide some data on next line treatment although a thorough assessment of the efficacy of 
retreatment will likely not be feasible.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No new safety signals have been observed with the A+AVD or the ABVD treatment. The type of AEs, 
SAEs, TEAEs was for the most part comparable across the Safety Population and subgroups of 
extranodal disease or disease staging (III/IV). No new risks were identified in these subgroups.  
Patients with stage III disease have more drug discontinuations compared to stage IV and the ITT 
population (mainly neuropathy and neutropenia as reason). Also there were more SAEs in stage III 
group compared to stage IV (48% vs 40%). It appears as though the stage III patients experience 
slightly more toxicity then stage IV patients. 
Premature study drug discontinuation occurred for 88 patients (13%) in the A+AVD treatment arm and 
105 patients (16%) in the ABVD treatment arm. Neuropathy related and febrile neutropenia accounted 
for the majority of the study drug discontinuations in the A+AVD treatment arm, whereas pulmonary 
toxicity accounted for the majority of study drug discontinuations in the ABVD treatment arm. AE 
resulting in a dose modification was more often reported for A+AVD then ABVD (64% vs 44%), also 
mostly related to neutropenia and neuropathy events.  
On study deaths were reported for 9 patients in the A+AVD arm (8 treatment related) and 13 in the 
ABVD arm (7 related). On-study deaths for the majority of the A+AVD patients were reported during 
Assessment report  
EMA/6661/2019  
Page 115/121 
 
 
 
 
Cycle 1 and were related to neutropenia and its associated complications. The majority of on-study 
deaths for ABVD patients were reported during Cycle 5 or Cycle 6, and were related to pulmonary 
toxicity.  
Peripheral neuropathy events of any grade were reported for 67% of the A+AVD and 43% of the ABVD 
treated patients. Most PN events were either grade 1 or 2. Peripheral sensory neuropathy accounted 
for the highest proportion of PN (SMQ) events reported. Peripheral neuropathy was manageable with 
dose reduction of brentuximab and resolved or improved over time. Thus, the risks are known and 
manageable by recommendations in the SmPC and risk minimisation activities in the RMP. 
At least 1 Interstitial lung disease (SMQ) event (any grade) was reported for 12 patients (2%) in the 
A+AVD and 44 patients (7%) in the ABVD treatment arm. At least 1 Grade 3 or higher ILD event was 
reported for <1% vs.3%, respectively, and a SAE in <1% vs. 3%, including 3 ABVD patients with a 
Grade 5 (fatal) ILD event. The most frequently reported ILD (SMQ) events of any grade for ABVD 
patients were pneumonitis pulmonary toxicity and interstitial lung disease.  
Infusion related reactions (IRRs) occurred in 9% of the patients treated with A+AVD and 15% of the 
ABVD patients.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety follow up is limited. The extension study of the ECHELON-1 trial will provide 
additional results to further characterise the safety profile of Adcetris in combination with doxorubicin, 
vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD) in this setting.  
The rate of secondary primary malignancies (SPM) was low and similar across arms (1.5% A+AVD and 
2% ABVD) although the follow up time was too short to draw definitive conclusions. Data from the 10 
year extension of the ECHELON-1 study will be needed to assess the rate of SPM.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Brentuximab vedotin +AVD treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement in IRF-based 
mPFS compared to ABVD treatment in the ITT, which was consistent across several sensitivity 
analyses.  
The MAH requests a subgroup indication limited to stage IV HL patients. The subgroup analyses show 
that patients with stage IV disease (HR mPFS: 0.711 (95% CI 0.529, 0.956) or 1 or more extranodal 
sites (mPFS HR 0.699 (95% CI 0.518, 0.943) seem to experience more benefit of A+AVD when 
compared with the ITT population (HR=0.770 [95% CI 0.603, 0.983]; p=0.035). A+AVD patients with 
Stage III HL (HR=0.922, [95% CI 0.599-1.419]) or no sites of extranodal HL (HR=1.042, [95% CI 
0.670- 1.619]) had apparently poorer efficacy outcomes when compared with the ITT population and 
the stage IV patients. For stage IV patients an OS advantage of A+AVD over ABVD was observed (HR= 
0.51 (95% CI [0.27, 0.97], p-value=0.037), which provides only some support for the mPFS data as 
this was based on a very limited number of patients. The secondary endpoint response rate results 
were similar for both treatment arms irrespective of stage III or IV. 
The safety profile of the A+AVD treatment is distinct from ABVD. Frequencies of several known ADRs, 
as well as of treatment discontinuation due to AEs, dose delays and dose reductions appeared higher 
than that of ABVD treatment. The ABVD treatment is associated with increased risk for pulmonary 
toxicity, whereas the A+AVD treatment is associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy 
and neutropenia. These could be partially managed with dose modifications and G-CSF prophylaxis and 
Assessment report

were in line with what is known for brentuximab vedotin as monotherapy and for the backbone 
chemotherapy.  
The type of AEs, SAEs, TEAEs was comparable across the Safety Population and did not differ with the 
presence of extranodal disease or disease staging (III/IV). It is noted that stage III patients have 
more drug discontinuations compared to stage IV and the ITT population (mainly neuropathy and 
neutropenia as reason), more SAEs in stage III group compared to stage IV (48% vs 40%). 
Stage IV elderly patients have a slightly favourable mPFS point estimate treated with A+AVD versus 
ABVD was observed, though the low number of events introduce considerable uncertainty regarding 
the true effect of the treatment. With respect to safety, the incidence in TEAE in stage IV elderly 
patients was similar in A+AVD versus ABVD. In general, A+AVD toxicity is severe and elderly patients 
require more dose modifications, however this also holds true for the ABVD arm. Elderly patients have 
an increased risk for febrile neutropenia with the A+AVD treatment. In the elderly patients there was a 
limited use of G-CSF prophylaxis (12% A+AVD 9% ABVD patients). In general the ECHELON-1 study 
consisted of fit HL patients (ECOG score 0 or 1). Ultimately treatment of elderly stage IV HL patients 
will depend on performance scores, risk factors and comorbidities and might be aimed at avoiding 
bleomycin toxicity. As such another treatment option besides ABVD is considered as benefit also for 
elderly stage IV patients. (see SmPC). 
The MAH will provide data from a 10-year extension of the pivotal Phase 3 study C25003 (ECHELON-1) 
which will follow-up on safety, subsequent therapy and OS. Response data on retreatment and salvage 
therapy will be collected, as well as additional data with respect to next line treatment, such as the 
reason for the next therapy and the time period during which symptoms leading to next therapy have 
existed (e.g., in case there was delay of therapy for any reason).  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The final indication is restricted in stage IV HL patients supported with data from the ECHELON-1 
study. In the context of an overall positive study with inconsistent results among key subgroups, the 
trend for positive mPFS results with some support from OS data for the stage IV patients (with or 
without extranodal disease) and the similar safety profile of the A+AVD regimen vs ABVD treatment 
for stage IV patients, render the benefit/risk of A+AVD in this patient subgroup positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Adcetris in previously untreated adult patients with CD30+ Stage IV Hodgkin 
lymphoma (HL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD) s positive.

patients with CD30+ Stage IV HL in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD), 
based on data from ECHELON-1 (C25003), a phase 3 multi-centre, randomised, open-label study 
comparing the modified progression-free survival (mPFS) obtained with brentuximab vedotin, 
doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine versus the mPFS obtained with doxorubicin, bleomycin, 
vinblastine and dacarbazine. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Furthermore, the PI is brought in

Introduction 
VIREAD  contains  the  active  substance  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  (tenofovir  DF  or  TDF),  which 
has an antiretroviral activity for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 
Substantial  improvements  in  the  antiretroviral  treatments  over  the  past  few  years  led  to  significant 
decrease  in  morbidity  and  mortality  due  to  HIV  infection.  Current  antiretroviral  agents  target  two 
specific  viral  enzymes:  reverse  transcriptase  (nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor  (NRTIs)  and 
non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  (NNRTIs))  and  protease  (protease  inhibitors  (PIs) 
Combination  therapy,  especially  triple  regimens,  is  considered  to  be  the  standard  of  care  of  HIV-1 
infected  patients.  The  antiretroviral  agents  already  authorised  within  the  European  Union  include: 
NRTIs:  zidovudine  (ZDV),  didanosine  (ddI),  zalcitabine  (ddC),  stavudine,  lamivudine  and  abacavir 
NNRTIs: nevirapine and efavirenz  
PIs: ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir and lopinavir 
For  the  treatment  of  HIV  infected  children,  the  available  registered  options  are  lamivudine,  
lopinavir.  
stavudine,  nelfinavir,  ritonavir, 
indinavir,  amprenavir,  nevirapine,  efavirenz  and 
The long-term use of all these products is, however, limited by emergence of resistance, by toxicity 
and  by  inconvenient  dosing  schedules  or  formulations.  An  increasing  number  of  patients  are  failing 
their current antiretroviral regimen. Antiretroviral agents susceptible to multi-resistant HIV are not yet 
available and choosing the best “salvage” therapy for patients who have failed one or more treatment 
regimens has become a difficult issue. Further therapeutic agents are therefore clearly needed that will  
re-establish virological suppression in these patients.  
Tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  is  a  salt  of  an  oral  prodrug  of  tenofovir.  Tenofovir  is  a  nucleoside 
monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue, a new class of agents, which has an in vitro antiviral activity 
against retroviruses and hepadnaviruses by inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme hence, by DNA 
chain termination. Because tenofovir was not well absorbed from the intestine, the prodrug, tenofovir 
disoproxil,  was  developed  to  increase  the  bioavailability.  Viread  is  available  as  a  film-coated  tablet, 
containing  245  mg  of  tenofovir  disoproxil  (as  fumarate),  equivalent  to  300  mg  tenofovir  disoproxil 
fumarate or 136 mg tenofovir. 
The  approved  indication  has  been  extended  further  to  the  assessment  of  an  additional  clinical  study 
conducted  in  treatment-naïve  patients  and  provided  post-authorisation,  and  is  currently  as  follows: 
“Viread is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of 
HIV-1 infected adults over 18 years of age. 
The  demonstration  of  benefit  of  Viread  is  based  on  results  of  one  study  in  treatment-naïve  patients, 
including patients with a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) and studies in which Viread was added 
to  stable  background  therapy  (mainly  tritherapy)  in  antiretroviral  pre-treated  patients  experiencing 
early virological failure (< 10,000 copies/ml, with the majority of patients having < 5,000 copies/ml). 
In  deciding  on  a  new  regimen  for  patients  who  have  failed  an  antiretroviral  regimen,  careful 
consideration  should  be  given  to  the  patterns  of  mutations  associated  with  different  medicinal 
products and the treatment history of the individual patient. Where available, resistance testing may 
be appropriate”.

The  recommended  dose  is  one  245  mg  tablet  daily  taken  orally  with  a  meal.  In  exceptional 
circumstances  in  patients  having  particular  difficulty  in  swallowing,  Viread  can  be  administered 
following disintegration of the tablet in at least 100 ml of water, orange juice or grape juice.

Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
As the quality variations submitted since the marketing authorisation was granted had no major impact 
on the safety/efficacy of Viread, the quality scientific discussion below reflects the data submitted in 
support  of  the  initial  marketing  authorisation.  See  "Steps  taken  after  granting  the  Marketing 
Authorisation" for information on quality variations. 
Composition 
Viread  is  formulated  as  immediate  release  film-coated  tablets  containing  245  mg  of  tenofovir 
disoproxil (as fumarate), equivalent to 136 mg of tenofovir.  The excipients are those commonly used 
in  this  type  of  product:  pregelatinised  starch  (binder);  croscarmellose  sodium  (disintegrant);  lactose 
monohydrate 
(lubricant);  
and  a  proprietary  hypromellose-based  film-coating  (lactose  monohydrate,  glycerol  triacetate, 
hypromellose, titanium dioxide [E171], indigo carmine lake [E132]). 
(filler);  microcrystalline  cellulose 
(filler);  magnesium 
stearate 
The tablets are presented in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with aluminium foil induction 
seals and polypropylene child-resistant caps.  Each bottle contains 30 tablets and includes a canister of 
silica  gel  as  a  desiccant  to  reduce  the  headspace  moisture,  and  polyester  fibre  to  prevent  tablet 
chipping in transit. 
Active substance 
Tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  (tenofovir  DF)  is  a  diester  prodrug  of  the  purine  based  nucleotide 
analogue,  tenofovir.    Tenofovir  DF  is  obtained  by  introduction  of  labile  esters  on  the  phosphonate 
group of tenofovir. This (isopropoxycarbonyloxy)methoxy ester is utilised as a promoiety in order to 
increase 
the  parent  compound.  
The  physicochemical  characteristics  of  tenofovir  DF  with  respect  to  salt  selection,  hygroscopicity, 
dissociation  constant,  partition  coefficient,  solubility,  solution  and  solid  state  have  been  studied. 
the  oral  bioavailability  of 
lipophilicity  and  enhance 
Tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  is  manufactured  as  an  anhydrous  crystalline  form  using  a  linear 
synthesis  which  has  been  well described, including  a flow  diagram. The  starting  material adenine is 
subjected to a two-step modification to form the skeleton of the final molecule, which is modified with 
protecting  groups.  A  deprotection  step  is  performed  prior  to  the  final  step,  which  consists  of 
esterification,  salt  formation  and  final  purification.  In  the  final  purification  step,  crude  tenofovir 
disoproxil  solution  is  washed  with  water,  then  concentrated,  treated  with  silica  gel,  and  filtered.   
A  solution  of  fumaric  acid  in  2-propanol  is  added  to  the  resulting  oil,  to  produce  the  fumarate  salt 
which is then crystallised, isolated by filtration, and rinsed with isopropyl ether. Following isolation, 
the product is dried at not more than 45°C to a solvent content (LOD or GC) of not more than 0.5 %.  
The dry product is milled to break up any aggregates. 
The  proposed  specification  for  the  starting  material  adenine  is  generally  adequate,  but  some 
amendments are required. 
Tenofovir DF contains a single chiral centre at the C-11 position (C-2 of the propyl side-chain) and the 
defined  method  of  synthesis  routinely  produces  the  R-enantiomer,  arising  from  the  use  of  
(R)-1,2-propylene  carbonate  in  the  first  reaction  step.  Proof  of  the  structure  has  been  provided  by 
means  of  elemental  analysis,  UV,  IR,  NMR,  MS,  and  single  crystal  X-ray  diffraction. 
Two polymorphic forms have been identified by X-ray powder diffraction and DSC, a ‘high’ melting 
polymorph  (115  -  118°C)  and  a  ‘low’  melting  polymorph  (112  -  114°C).    The  melting  enthalpies, 
intrinsic  dissolution  rates  and  solubility  of  these  crystal  forms  are  indistinguishable,  and  therefore 
these solid-state differences are unlikely to result in clinical consequences. 
The  specification  for  the  active  substance  includes  relevant  tests  for:  appearance:  identity  
(IR  &  HPLC);  assay  by  HPLC  (97-101  %  tenofovir  DF,  non-chiral);  enantiomeric  purity  by  HPLC 
(not  less  than  98  %  of  the  R-isomer);  14  potential  related  impurities  are  described  of  which  8  are 
3/43

controlled in the specification by HPLC; organic volatile impurities; and heavy metals. Physical tests 
include: clarity of solution; water content; DSC (main endotherm characterisation); and particle size. 
9-propenyladenine  (9-PA)  is  a  process-related  impurity  which  is  mutagenic.  Although  the  amounts 
found  in  batches  of  the  drug  substance  have  been  monitored  and  limited  throughout  development,  
a  routine  test  and  limits  for  this  impurity  should  be  included  in  the  active  substance  specification. 
Three  manufacturers  of  the  active  substance  have  been  nominated.  Although  the  same  synthetic 
methods are used at each of the sites, slightly different solvents may be used, therefore some further 
justification of the proposed residual solvent specifications is required. 
Analytical  validation  data  for  all  analytical  methods  are  provided  and  take  into  account  current 
guidelines. Details of the reference standards are provided. 
Batch  analyses  data  are  presented  for  a  total  of  39  batches  of  tenofovir  DF  used  in  toxicological, 
clinical  and  stability  studies,  with  precise  impurity  profile,  however  some  further  clarification  
is required. 
Stability of the active substance 
Tenofovir DF shows excellent physicochemical stability when stored at 5ºC for up to 36 months (three 
lots,  packaged  in  polyethylene  bags,  sealed,  and  then  placed  into  tightly  capped  HDPE  bottles),  
the primary route of chemical degradation being hydrolysis. There was no significant loss in purity or 
increase  in  total  impurity  and  degradation  product  content  after  storage  under  accelerated  storage 
to  6  months. 
conditions  (same  packaging,  at  25ºC/60  %RH  &  30ºC/60  %RH)  for  up 
Tenofovir DF active substance is specified to be stored under refrigeration at 2 - 8ºC.  Tenofovir DF is 
to  be  stored  in  polyethylene  bags,  which  are  placed  into  tightly  closed  HDPE  containers  and  the 
proposed retest period of 24 months is supported.

Satisfactory  control  specifications  and  certificates  are  provided  for  the  packaging  materials.  
The  bottles  and  closures  are  controlled  according  to  the  general  PhEur  requirements  for  plastic 
containers and closures. 
Product development and finished product 
The fumarate salt of the diester prodrug of tenofovir is chosen to increase the intestinal permeability 
and to improve the bioavailability of the active substance.  The choice for a tablet presentation, and the 
rationale for  both the  proposed  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition of the  formulation has  been 
presented. 
The processing parameters, including those for the film-coating, have been investigated and optimised.  
The  free  moisture  in  the  tablets  is  minimised  both  during  the  manufacturing  process  and  in  the 
packaging.  The HDPE resin used for the primary packaging (bottles) is thick and was selected based 
upon  moisture vapour transmission  data, as the  product  must  be  protected from  extended  periods  of 
exposure to high moisture conditions.   The use of  1 gram of silica  gel (in a canister) per bottle was 
established based upon stability data. Induction sealing of the bottle (with aluminium foil) also reduces 
the available moisture.

Film  coated  tablets  of  different  strengths  have  been  used  in  clinical  trials  and  the  formulations  for 
these  have  been  presented.  Bioequivalence  of  the  34  %  w/w  active  clinical  formulation  and  the 
intended  commercial  formulation  was  examined  in  an  open-label  pharmacokinetic  study  in  healthy 
volunteers.  The results demonstrated that the intended commercial formulation is bioequivalent to the 
early clinical formulation prototype. 
The  manufacturing  processes  have  all  been  well  described.  Manufacture  commences  with  
a conventional wet granulation process, followed by a drying step to dry the granules (to LOD ≤ 3 %) 
to reduce the intragranular moisture content.  After compression, the bulk uncoated tablets are tested 
for hardness and friability. Finally the film-coating (aqueous based) is applied. 
The  industrial  batch  size  has  been  stated  to  be  up  to  1000  kg.  The  frequency  of  in-process  control 
testing remains to be fully clarified. 
Nine lots of up to 230 kg in size have been manufactured and used for validation studies, and although 
the  process  has  been  shown  to  be  robust  and  to  result  in  consistent  product  some  points  for 
clarification remain and some further validation data are also required. 
Product specification 
The product specification contains the relevant tests and limits for a product of this type. Tests include 
appearance,  identification  of  the  active  substance  (HPLC  &  UV),  assay  (96  –  105  %  at  release,  
90  –  105  %  during  shelf  life,  by  HPLC),  and  limits  for  10  named  related  impurities/degradates. 
Unspecified  impurities  are  limited  to  not  more  than  0.2%  each.  In  addition  there  are  also  tests  for 
content uniformity (PhEur), dissolution, water content and microbial limits (PhEur). 
The proposed specification limits for total impurities and degradation products, in both the release and 
shelf-life specifications are very high and remain to be tightened or further justified by reference to the  
original toxicological studies.  
The  analytical  methods  are  described  and  suitably  validated,  in  accordance  with  current  guidelines. 
Batch analyses results on 10 batches are provided. 
Stability of the product 
Long-term  and  accelerated  stability  studies  were  conducted  on  nine  batches  of  tenofovir  DF  tablets, 
245 mg. The stability batches were produced at a scale that is greater than one-tenth of the intended 
commercial scale, were identical in the composition, used the same manufacturing process, and were 
packaged into the same container-closure system as the intended commercial product. 
Long-term stability studies were conducted at 25ºC/60 %RH and 12 months data are available for two 
batches and 9 months data for three batches. 
The  results  indicate  an  acceptable  long-term  stability.  The  tablets  remained  within  the  product 
specifications when stored for up to 12 months at 25ºC/60 %RH. A statistical analysis was performed 
to estimate the total impurity and degradation product content at the proposed expiration dating period 
of 24 months. The stability data provided however do not yet support the claimed limit of 8.0 % for 
impurities/degradation products in the shelf-life specification. 
No  significant  change  in  physicochemical  stability  was  observed  for  tenofovir  DF  tablets  stored  for  
6  months  at  40ºC/75  %RH.  The  drug  product  remained  within  the  product  specifications  over  the  
6 month study duration. No significant change in physicochemical stability was observed for tenofovir 
DF tablets exposed to artificial daylight fluorescent lamps.

On the basis of the long-term and accelerated stability data and the statistical analyses, the proposed 
shelf life, that is, 24 months with no specific storage condition, is acceptable. However clarification of 
some of the stability data, and some additional data are required.

Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tenofovir  is  a  nucleotide  analogue  (i.e.,  a  nucleoside  monophosphate  analogue).  Compared  to 
nucleoside  analogues,  it  does  not  require  an  initial  phosphorylation  reaction,  which  is  often  rate 
limiting, 
(PMPApp).  
PMPApp efficiently inhibits both RNA- and DNA-directed HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activities 
by direct binding competition with the natural deoxyribonucleotide substance and, after incorporation 
into DNA, by premature termination of DNA synthesis. 
the  active  metabolite: 
tenofovir  diphosphate 
to  be  converted 
to 
Intracellular  constitutively  expressed  enzymes  convert 
two 
phosphorylation  reactions.  This  conversion  occurs  both  in  activated  cells  as  well  as  in  non 
proliferating lymphocytes and macrophages.  
to  PMPApp 
tenofovir 
through 
In  resting  human  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMCs),  the  half-life  of  PMPApp  was 
approximately  50 hours,  whereas  the  half-life  in  activated  PBMCs  was  approximately  10  hours. 
Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of cellular polymerases α, β, and γ, with kinetic inhibition 
constants (Ki) that are more than 200-fold higher against human DNA polymerase α (5.2 µmol) and 
more  than  3,000-fold  higher  against  human  DNA  polymerase  β  and  γ  (81.7  and  59.5 µmol, 
respectively) than its Ki against HIV-1 RT (0.02 µmol).   
In vitro antiviral activity 
The  in  vitro  antiviral  activity  and  cytotoxicity  of  tenofovir  and  tenofovir  DF  were  evaluated  in 
different cell types. 
The concentration of tenofovir required for 50 % inhibition (IC50) of wild-type HIVIIIB  is 1-6 µmol in 
MT-2  or  MT-4  cells  (based  on  inhibition  of  viral  cytopathic  effect)  and  0.2-0.4  µmol  in  PBMCs 
(based  on  inhibition  of  virus  production).  Tenofovir  had  an  IC50  of  0.04 µmol  against  HIV-1BaL  in 
primary monocyte/macrophage cells. The mean tenofovir IC50 was 0.9 µmol against a panel of 10 wild 
type clinical isolates. Due to its increased cellular permeability, the anti-HIV activity of tenofovir DF 
was increased by 17 to 90-fold over that of tenofovir.  
The mean IC50 of tenofovir against HIV-1 subtypes A, C, D, E, F, G, and O in PBMCs were within 
two-fold of subtype B (0.55 to 2.2 µmol).  
In  different  cell  types,  tenofovir  exhibited  no  or  low  cytotoxicity.  For  instance,  in  PBMCs  and  
MT-2  cells,  CC50  values  of  tenofovir  were  above  1  µmol.  The  selectivity  index  for  tenofovir  was 
therefore superior to 2,000 (SI = CC50/IC50).  
Tenofovir  was  active  against  HIV-2  in  vitro,  with  a  potency  similar  to  the  one  against  HIV-1.  
In vitro, it has also an antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of retroviruses and hepadnaviruses. 
Tenofovir  showed  in  vitro  minor  to  moderate  synergy  with  didanosine  and  nelfinavir,  but  a  strong 
synergy  with  zidovudine,  amprenavir  and  all  non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  tested.  
The  other  combinations  were  additive,  and  no  significant  antiviral  antagonism  was  observed. 
As nucleoside analogues are associated with mitochondrial toxicity and production of lactic acidosis, 
the potential effects of tenofovir were evaluated in vitro. At concentration up to 300 µmol, tenofovir 
did not have any effect on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA nor on the production of lactic acidosis 
6/43 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
but  additional  in  vivo  studies  are  ongoing  to  confirm  these  findings,  the  results  of  which  will  be 
provided as specific obligations to be fulfilled post-authorisation. 
In vivo antiviral activity 
The  antiviral  activity  of  tenofovir  was  confirmed  in  in  vivo  animal  models,  including  SIV  infected 
macaques. 
Resistance 
The  K65R  mutation  in  RT  was  obtained  in  vitro  with  successive  passage  of  HIV-1  in  increasing 
concentrations of tenofovir. The K65R mutation, which is also selected by zalcitabine, didanosine and 
abacavir,  was  associated  with  a  limited  phenotypic  resistance  to  tenofovir  (3  to  4-fold  reduced 
susceptibility).  Tenofovir  remained  active  (IC50  within  2  fold  of  the  wild  type)  against  recombinant 
mutant  molecular  clones  of  HIV-1  expressing  didanosine  (L74V),  zalcitabine  (T69D),  zidovudine 
(D67N  +  K70R  or  T215Y),  multinucleoside  (Q151M)  and  abacavir/lamivudine  (M184V)  resistance. 
The  susceptibility  results  with  molecular  clones  of  HIV-1  were  confirmed  and  extended  with 
phenotypic analyses of a panel of recombinant HIV-1 clinical isolates from antiretroviral experienced 
patients.  Clinical HIV isolates expressing MI84V mutation alone showed mild reduced susceptibility 
to  tenofovir  (0.7-fold).  Viral  clones  carrying  both  zidovudine-associated  mutations  and  M184V 
mutation were more susceptible to tenofovir as compared to the ones carrying zidovudine-associated 
mutations  (fold  of  resistance  ranging  from  0.9-3.7  fold  versus  0.9-8.4  fold  respectively).  
The  susceptibility  to  tenofovir  of  recombinant  HIV-1  isolates  containing  the  69  insert  was  
5.6 to 34.9-fold increased (>10-fold for five isolates), which demonstrates the high resistance of these 
viruses  to  tenofovir.  On  the  other  hand,  the  susceptibility  to  tenofovir  of  isolates  resistant  to 
lamivudine and expressing the mutation Q151M complex ranged from 0.6 to 3.3-fold increases, which 
suggests 
resistant  viruses  was  maintained. 
for  multi-compounds 
Cross-resistance  is  unlikely  with  non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors,  as  they  bind  to  a 
structurally distinct portion of RT; the same for protease inhibitors, due to the different enzyme target.

General and safety pharmacology programme 
Studies did not reveal any adverse effects on the central nervous system of rats dosed at 500 mg/kg or 
on the cardiovascular system of dogs dosed at 30 mg/kg. In rats receiving doses of 500 mg/kg, there 
was evidence of renal effects, suggesting that kidney may be the target organ for toxicity of tenofovir 
DF. Overall, there was no evidence that tenofovir had any significant effect on any of the major organ 
systems at doses exceeding the proposed therapeutic dose, which is equivalent to 6 mg/kg/day based 
on a 50 kg person. 
Pharmacokinetics  
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  tenofovir  and  tenofovir  DF  was  determined,  using  validated  testing 
methods,  in  several  species  (mice,  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys)  following  oral  administration.  
Studies  were  conducted  with  tenofovir  free  base  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  in  both  the  citrate  and 
fumarate  salt  forms.  All  experiments  with  the  citrate  salt  used  solutions,  thereby  assuring 
comparability to experiments in which the fumarate salt was employed (the citrate and fumarate salts 
are completely dissociated in solution).  
Absorption and distribution 
Following  oral  administration,  the  absorption  of  tenofovir  DF  was  rapid  with  a  maximum  tenofovir 
plasma  concentration  obtained  within  0.25  to  1.5  hours  post  dose  in  all  species  and  declined  in  a 
biphasic manner. The observed terminal half-life values were approximately 7, 9 and 60 hours in rats, 
monkeys and dogs respectively.  
The bioavailability of tenofovir DF was moderate and dependent of the species, ranging between 10 
and  40  %  (10-20  %  in  rodents  and  30-40  %  in  dogs  and  monkeys).  It  depended  also  upon  the  
7/43 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
co-administration of food, as food increased the absorption. The bioavailability seemed partially dose-
dependent as it decreased with increasing doses. 
Doses less than 100 mg/kg exhibited linear pharmacokinetics. In monkeys receiving 250 mg/kg, Cmax 
and AUC were less than dose proportional, suggesting decreased absorption, whereas in dogs, values 
appeared  to  be  linear  with  dose.  Following  repeated  oral  administration,  no  accumulation  was 
observed except in dogs for which a 2-3 fold increase in both Cmax and AUC occurred after 28 days 
of treatment. 
The  volume  of  distribution  was  high  in  all  species  (more  than  1.0  l/kg),  suggesting  that  tenofovir 
distributes  widely.  The  highest  concentrations  were  present  in  bile,  kidney  and  liver  of  dogs. 
Tenofovir  did  not  appear  to  cross  the  brain  barrier  but  crossed  the  placenta  in  monkeys. 
The protein binding was not evaluated in animals, but was found to be low in human plasma. 
Metabolism and elimination 
Tenofovir DF was rapidly converted into tenofovir in plasma and liver, much more slowly in intestine. 
Tenofovir  was  metabolised  intracellularly  to  tenofovir  diphosphate  with  a  T1/2  over  50  hours  in 
monkeys  PBMCs.  In  vitro,  tenofovir  disoproxil,  tenofovir  soproxil  and  tenofovir  were  detected,  
with tenofovir soproxil being the major metabolite observed intracellular. 
Following oral administration of tenofovir DF in rats and dogs, tenofovir disoproxil was metabolised 
by non specific esterases to tenofovir. No other metabolites than tenofovir and tenofovir soproxil were 
detected. In vitro, tenofovir DF did not have any inhibiting or inducing effect on CYP3A4, 2D6, 2C9, 
2E1 and 1A2. However it induced CYP 1A1 and 2B. 
In  all  species,  the  primary  route  of  elimination  was  renal,  mainly  as  unchanged  substance. 
 Following intravenous injection of 14C-tenofovir in dogs and rats, more than 90 % of the administered 
dose  was  recovered  in  urine  by  72  hours  post  dose,  primarily  as  the  unchanged  substance.  
Renal clearance values in rats were 2-4 times the rate of the creatinine clearance (1580 ml/hr/kg versus  
314  ml/hr/kg),  suggesting  the  involvement  of  both  glomerular  filtration  and  tubular  secretion  in  the 
excretion of tenofovir. The tubular secretion was particularly important in monkeys as renal clearance 
was 4-fold higher than creatinine clearance. 
Following oral administration of 14C-tenofovir in dogs, the amount of the dose recovered in urine was 
approximately  25  %  to  28  %  at  24  hours  post  dose;  15  %  to  20  %  of  the  dose  remained  in  tissues. 
These values were close to the total amount of dose absorbed. 
Excretion into milk was moderate. Indeed in rats receiving 600 mg/kg/day, tenofovir concentration in 
milk represented less than 23.5 % of the corresponding tenofovir plasma concentration.  
Toxicology 
A conventional toxicological programme using tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was carried out in rats, 
mice, rabbits and rhesus monkeys. Based on the pharmacokinetic data, these species were considered 
relevant models for toxicology studies, since all the animals achieved adequate exposure to the active 
compound. Tenofovir and tenofovir DF were administered orally, which is the intended clinical route 
of administration. Most of the studies have been conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices. 
Toxicokinetic studies showed that exposure achieved in animals resulted in safety factors between 2 
and 10 for a specific target organ according to species evaluated.  
Single dose toxicity 
The  acute  toxicity  of  tenofovir  DF  was  evaluated  at  doses  up  to  1500  mg/kg  in  rats  and  up  to  
270 mg/kg in dogs. There were no deaths or clinical abnormalities recorded in rats. In dogs, treatment-
related  lesions  in  the  kidneys  were  observed  with  doses  equivalent  to  90  and  270  mg/kg.  
These were characterised by tubular karyomegaly and/or basophilia.

Repeated dose toxicity  
Repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  mice  (13  weeks),  rats  (up  to  42  weeks)  and  dogs  
(up  to  42  weeks).  In  long-term  studies,  the  highest  doses  of  tenofovir  DF  administered  were  
1000 mg/kg in rats and 30 mg/kg in dogs. 
In  rats,  the  target  organs  were  the  gastro-intestinal  tract  (intestinal  epithelial  hypertrophy/slight  to 
moderate  intestinal  hyperplasia)  and  kidney  (renal  tubular  epithelial  karyomegaly  and  pigment 
accumulation at dose of 30 mg/kg/day). It was suggested that gastro-intestinal lesions could be rodent 
specific  occurring  at  the  highest  doses  as  no  signs  were  reported  in  either  monkeys  or  in  dogs.  
It  was  agreed  however  that  this  finding  should  be  further  investigated.  Changes  in  serum  chemistry 
parameters, including dose-related slight to moderate changes in cholesterol, triglycerides, ALT, AST 
and  creatinine  were  also  reported  in  the  300  mg  dose  group.  All  these  effects  were  reversible  after 
treatment discontinuation. The no-observed effect-level (NOEL) determined was less than 30 mg/kg, 
and therefore no overall safety margins could be established. 
In  dogs,  the  main  target  organ  was  the  kidney.  Dose-related  histopathological  changes  included 
tubular  dilatation  and  interstitial  nephritis  reported  in  the  10  and/or  30  mg/kg/day  dose  groups  and 
slight to moderate renal tubular karyomegaly in all treated groups.  Proteinuria, glycosuria, creatinine 
augmentation and increased urine volume were observed in the 30 mg/kg/day dose group throughout 
the study. NOAEL was less than 3 mg/kg and no overall safety margin could be established.  
A  concern  was  raised  as  tenofovir  DF  was  found  to  be  nephrotoxic  at  high  doses  in  all  species.  
The signs reported were specific to a decreased glomerular filtration rate as well as proximal tubular 
impairment. It was shown that tenofovir is transported into tubular cells by the human organic anion 
transporter  1  (hOAT1),  as  cidofovir.  Cytotoxicity  studies  were  performed  to  assess  the  effect  of 
tenofovir in several in vitro models for renal proximal tubular toxicity compared to other nucleotide 
analogues  (cidofovir  and  adefovir).  Results  suggested  a  less  marked  nephrotoxicity  profile  of 
tenofovir,  probably  due  to  a  lower  interference  of  tenofovir  with  essential  intracellular  functions. 
Another  study  revealed  that  tenofovir  showed  negligible  direct  cell  toxicity  in  normal  human  renal 
proximal tubule epithelial cells.  
Decreases in bone mineral content and bone mineral density, consistent with increased bone resorption 
were also reported in dogs (30 mg/kg/day) and rats (1000 mg/kg/day). This was further supported by 
findings of hypercalciuria and hyperphosphaturia, loss of bone mineral content and bone density. Bone 
changes did not seem to completely reverse during the recovery period. Bone mineral loss resulting in 
pathologic osteomalacia was also observed in juvenile monkeys treated with 30 mg/kg s.c., after more 
than 4 months of treatment. To further explore the bone toxicity mechanism and its relation with renal 
toxicity, specific in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted. In vitro, tenofovir DF was not cytotoxic 
to  osteoblast-like  cells.  In  vivo,  hypophosphataemia  appeared  to  be  caused  by  deteriorated  intestinal 
phosphate  absorption  or  an  impaired  renal  phosphate  reabsorption.  The  effects  of  tenofovir  DF  on

56-day  study,  the  results  of  which  were  provided  as  a  specific  obligation  post-authorisation.  Renal 
toxicity  did  not  seem  therefore  to  be  directly  associated  with  the  effect  on  bone.  Phosphate 
supplementation  given  in  rats  and  monkeys  appeared  to  overcome  the  impairment,  resulting  in 
increased  urinary  phosphorus  excretion,  but  the  benefit  of  phosphate  supplementation  has  not  been 
evaluated in clinical studies.

Reproduction toxicity 
Tenofovir DF did not affect fertility and general reproductive performance of the male and female rats 
at doses up to 600 mg/kg. Tenofovir DF was neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic in rats (doses up to 
450  mg/kg/day)  and  in  rabbits  (doses  up  to  300  mg/kg/day).  The  NOEL  for  maternal  effects  was  
150 mg/kg/day in rats and 100 mg in rabbits respectively. In peri- and post natal toxicity study in rats, 
tenofovir DF significantly reduced pups survival and animal weights. The viability index in rats was 
reduced in the 450 mg/kg/dose group and significantly reduced in 600 mg/kg/day. Pup weights were 
also  decreased  in  these  groups  and  there  was  a  slight  delay  of  sexual  maturation  that  did  not  affect 
reproductive  performance.  The  non  effect  dose  was  150  mg/kg.  In  a  non  GLP  study  in  rhesus 
macaques,  there  was  evidence  of  reduced  birth  weight  and  several  bone  lengths  at  a  dose  of  
9/43 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
30 mg/kg/day, that correspond to 25-times the human exposure. Based on these results, tenofovir DF 
should  be  used  in  pregnant  women  only  if  the  potential  benefit  outweighs  the  potential  risks  to  the 
foetus as recommended in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Mutagenicity 
The  mutagenic  potential  of  tenofovir  DF  was  evaluated  in  a  standard  battery  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
tests. Tenofovir DF was positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal in the Ames tests 
(positive  in  one  assay  using  the  strain  of  Salmonella  typhimurium  TA  1535  with  or  without 
activation). Tenofovir DF was negative in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse (doses up to 2000 
mg/kg orally). To clarify these findings and complete the information on the genotoxicity of tenofovir 
DF,  additional  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  UDS  test  on  rats  hepatic  cells  have  been  performed  in  order  to 
assess the ability of tenofovir DF (or metabolites) to cause DNA damage by measuring UDS induced 
in vivo in primary hepatocytes cultured in vitro. The tenofovir DF was considered as weakly positive 
in this assay, showing that tenofovir can induce DNA damage and supporting the previous mutagenic 
potential  results.  These  results  will  have  to  be  considered  in  the  light  of  the  final  assessment  of  the 
rodent carcinogenicity studies. 
Carcinogenicity  
The  carcinogenic  potential  of  tenofovir  DF  has  been  evaluated  in  rats  and  in  mice.  Long-term 
carcinogenicity  studies  were  ongoing  at  the  time  of  the  original  CPMP  Opinion.  Preliminary  results 
(12  months  and  22  months  data  in  mice  and  rats)  did  not  raise  any  particular  concerns  since  no 
external gross evidence of carcinogenicity was reported.  The final results were submitted as part of 
specific obligations and were fulfilled post-authorisation. In these studies, animals were administered 
tenofovir  DF  once  daily  by  oral  gavage  for  2  years.  The  high  doses  in  these  studies  were  selected 
based on the endpoint of gastrointestinal/kidney/bone toxicity in the rat (0, 30, 100, 300 mg/kg) and on 
the maximum concentration that could be reliably delivered in mice (0, 100, 300, 600 mg/kg). 
Final report on the 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in rats: 
Lifetime  daily  administration  of  tenofovir  DF  at  dosage  levels  of  up  to  300  mg/kg/day  to  Sprague-
Dawley rats did not reveal major concerns in carcinogenicity. Nevertheless, an increased incidence of 
the  sub-cutaneous tissue/lipoma  in  males and  uterus polyp/endometrial stroma in females  have  been 
observed.  In  the  light  of  historical  control  data,  it  was  concluded  that  the  5%  incidence  of  sub-
cutaneous tissue/lipoma in  male could  be  considered  incidental in origin. Furthermore,  based  on the 
fact that the increase in uterus polyp/endometrial stroma in females was minimal compared to reported 
values and that there was no evidence of any treatment-related effect (non-neoplastic and neoplastic) 
on the reproductive organs (uterus, ovaries and vagina), the increase in incidence of the benign tumour 
could be considered to be of no toxicological significance. 
Final report on the 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in mice: 
CD-1 mice were treated for 104 weeks with tenofovir DF and were exposed to the maximal possible 
dose, since over 600 mg/kg,  gastro-intestinal tract toxicity lead to the death of the animals. However 
at  this  dosage,  body  weight  gain  was  not  significantly  reduced  and  survival  was  comparable  among 
the different control and treated groups.  
- Duodenal neoplasms have been observed in few animals receiving very high dose of tenofovir DF 
(600 mg/kg in mice versus 4-5 mg/kg in humans). These are probably the consequence of hyperplasia, 
resulting from irritation, in response to the formaldehyde released from tenofovir DF. The high dose 
and  the  small  area  exposed  in  mice  are  conditions  that  will  not  occur  in  humans.  Furthermore,  it 
should  be  pointed  out  that  mouse  adenocarcinomas  have  not  been  observed  in  rats,  despite  the 
observation of hyperplasia in this species. Altogether, the duodenal hyperplasia and low incidence of 
duodenal tumours observed at the highest dose in the mouse carcinogenicity study are not considered 
to present a significant carcinogenic risk for humans. 
- A statistically significant increase of hepatocellular adenoma has been observed in female animals in 
the  high  dose  group  relative  to  controls.  This  is  probably  in  relation  to  the  treatment  in  light  of  the 
non-neoplastic hepatocellular lesions observed. However, this observation was present in only one sex 
and  one  species  and  no  carcinomas  were  observed,  suggesting  that  this  finding  does  not  seem  to 
represent a risk for humans. 
10/43 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In conclusion, given the results from the rat  carcinogenicity assay, which  reveal  no  major  concerns, 
the  fact  that  tenofovir  DF  is  positive  only  at  the  highest  dose  tested  (600  mg/kg/day)  in  the  mouse 
carcinogenicity study, the margin of safety and the likelihood that the observed tumours could result 
from  local  high  concentrations  of  tenofovir  DF,  it  can  be  considered  that  there  are  no  significant 
concerns, regarding the carcinogenic potential of tenofovir DF in patients. 
Local tolerance 
Tenofovir  DF  was  a  severe  irritant  to  the  ocular  tissue  and  a  slight  irritant  for  the  skin.  
By contrast tenofovir was not a contact sensitizer in guinea pigs. 
Impurities 
All  the  impurities  of  synthesis  or  degradation  origin  were  present  in  material  tested  in  toxicology 
studies and therefore were toxicologically qualified.  
Environmental risk assessment 
The  predicted  environment  concentration  value  was  below  the  defined  threshold  of  0.01  µg/l, 
suggesting that it is unlikely to pose a risk to the environment at the proposed dose recommendation. 
Other 
As tenofovir DF is an ester prodrug, a concern was raised with respect to the potential release of two 
molecules of formaldehyde, a known toxic compound, for each molecule of tenofovir generated upon 
hydrolysis.  The  distribution  of  formaldehyde  in  the  body  is  currently  unknown.  The  applicant, 
however,  estimated  a  high  safety  margin  between  the  maximum  dose  that  could  be  absorbed  in 
patients (0.6 mg/kg for 60 weighted patient) and the NOAEL for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity 
of formaldehyde based on published literature.  
4.  
Part IV: Clinical aspects 
The  clinical  programme  aimed  to  investigate  the  antiviral  activity  of  tenofovir  DF  either  as 
monotherapy or in combination with other antiretroviral agents in antiretroviral naïve and experienced 
HIV-1 infected adult patients.  
The  initial  application  for  the  marketing  authorisation  focused  however  only  on  clinical  data  to 
support the use of tenofovir DF, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, in multi-
experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients who expressed multi-resistance at baseline.  
Post  authorisation,  as  part  of  the  clinical  programme,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  has 
submitted the results of a double blind pivotal study in antiretroviral naïve patients.   
All the clinical trials were performed according to the Good Clinical Practices and agreed international 
ethical principles. An overview of the clinical programme is presented in table 1.

Clinical Pharmacology 
Antiviral activity 
Tenofovir DF is a nucleotide analogue, which had an antiretroviral activity demonstrated in vitro and 
in  vivo  in  animal  models  as  presented  in  the  Pharmaco-toxicological  part  of  this  document. 
Results from early clinical studies support the potential clinical benefit of tenofovir DF monotherapy 
in suppressing plasma HIV RNA levels.  
In  study  701,  short  term  daily  intravenous  administration  of  tenofovir  DF  at  doses  of  1  mg/kg  
and 3 mg/kg in HIV-1 infected patients, who were either treatment naïve or experienced, resulted in a 
reduction  of  HIV  RNA  levels  by  0.6  and  1.1  log10  copies/ml  at  day  14,  respectively.  
The  viral  suppression  was  maintained  for  up  to  one  week  following  treatment  discontinuation  
(-0.20  and  -1.07  log10  copies/ml  respectively).  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences 
between tenofovir DF and placebo groups with respect to CD4 cell counts. 
A  significant  decrease  compared  to  placebo  was  also  demonstrated  in  the  early  dose  ranging  study 
901, which will be further detailed under the section dose ranging studies. 
Resistance profile 
As described in the Pharmaco-toxicological  part of this document, in vitro resistance  data suggested 
that  tenofovir  DF  presents  a  favourable  resistance  profile.  To  further  characterise  the  genotypic  and 
phenotypic  profile  of  tenofovir,  resistance  data  were  collected  from  the  main  clinical  studies:  
902  (virology  ITT  population  of  184  patients),  907  (virology  ITT  population  of  253  patients)  and  
903 (virology AT population of 37 patients). 
•  Genotypic analysis 
Study 902 and 907  
In both studies, the distribution of resistance mutations at baseline was similar across treatment groups 
and  was  consistent  with  the  extensive  treatment  experience  of  the  patients  (see  table  2).

In addition, 1 patient in study 902 and 5 in study 907, all of them from the tenofovir arms expressed 
the K65R RT mutation (mutation associated with zalcitabine, didanosine and abacavir in vivo and also 
selected by tenofovir DF in vitro) at baseline. 
HIV-RNA response by baseline resistance mutation 
In study 902, for patients receiving tenofovir DF in addition to their existing regimen, a comparable 
decline  in  HIV-RNA  was  observed  by  week  48  whatever  the  genotype  measured  at  baseline 
 (-  0.62  log10  copies/ml  DAVG48).  In  particular,  a  comparable  virologic  response  was  observed 
between  patients  resistant 
log10  copies/ml  versus  
-0.61 log10 copies/ml, DAVG48, respectively).

In study 907, patients in the virological substudy receiving tenofovir DF in addition to their existing 
regimen  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  mean  decrease  in  HIV-RNA  level  by  week  24  
(-0.59 log10 DAVG24 versus - 0.03 log10 copies/ml, p <0.0001) and by week 48 (-0.56 log10 DAVG24

versus  -  0.7  log10  copies/ml,  p  <0.0001)  compared  to  placebo,  despite  the  presence  of  extensive  RT 
resistance  mutation at baseline. The highest reduction in viral load was observed in patients without 
zidovudine  resistance  but  with  the  M184V  mutation  among  all  genotypic  groups  at  week  24  
(-0.97  log10  DAVG24,  p  <0.0001)  and  at  week  48  (-0.90  log10  DAVG48,  p  <0.0001).  The  difference 
with  other  groups  was  not  statistically  relevant.  Patients  with  K65R  mutation  at  baseline  did  not 
respond  to  tenofovir  DF  (+  0.12  log10  mean  DAVG24).  Treatment  with  tenofovir  DF  resulted  in 
infrequent  development  of  resistance  to  tenofovir,  as  only  8/274  patients  (3%)  developed  the  K65R 
mutation by week 48. 
Study 903 
Patients with virologic rebound or suboptimal therapy were analyzed for the development of resistance 
to  tenofovir  and  all  other  RT  inhibitors  (As  treated  population).  Distribution  of  patients  with  HIV 
expressing  NRTI-  and  NNRTI-Associated  Resistance  Mutations  at  Virologic  Failure  (n = 37,

Four  percent  of  patients  analysed  had  HIV  expressing  resistance  mutations  to  the  NNRTI  class 
without  significant  difference  between  treatment  groups  (4.7%  versus  3.3  %  in  tenofovir  DF  group 
versus  d4T  group  respectively  p=0.41).  Among  NRTI-associated  resistance  mutations,  M184V/I 
occurred  in  2.7%  of  patients  with  no  difference  between  treatment  groups.  The  most  common  other 
NRTI-associated  mutation  was  the  K65R  mutation,  occurring  more  frequently  in  the  tenofovir  DF 
group (2.3%) compared with the active control group (0.7%).  
The  potential  development  of  reverse  transcriptase  mutations  (non  K65R)  selected  by  tenofovir  in 
naïve patients was of particular interest. Of note, 5 patients over the 22 who failed with the tenofovir 
DF  containing  regimen  displayed  NRTI-associated  resistance  mutations  (non  M184V/I  and  non 
K65R). One patient had a K219Q mutation that was detected at baseline.  Some substitutions occurred 
in  positions  already  identified  but  with  amino-acids  changes  different  from  those  known  to  induce 
genotypic  resistance  (D67G+K70E+V75L,  K219R).  Two  patients  had  additionally  developed  an 
A62V  mutation  and  one  of  these  patients  also  developed  a  Y115F  mutation.  The  impact  on  HIV 
resistance for the additional development of these RT mutations is unknown and needs to be further 
investigated by the Marketing Authorisation Holder.  
•  Phenotypic analysis 
Study 902 and 907 
The influence of the phenotype at baseline on the virological response at week 24 was also assessed in 
both  studies  using  Virco  Antivirogram  TM  assay  (n  =  54  in  study  902  and  n  =  85  in  study  907).  
In  particular,  the  impact  of  zidovudine-resistant  HIV  at  baseline  in  the  virological  response  was 
assessed. Results are displayed in table 4.

A correlation between the tenofovir susceptibility at baseline and the virological response to 300 mg 
tenofovir DF was demonstrated in both studies. The small number of patients with baseline tenofovir 
susceptibility  of  3  and  4  fold  precludes  defining  a  potential  clinical  breakpoint  for  tenofovir. 
In  study  907,  tenofovir  DF  patients  with  baseline  tenofovir  susceptibility  within  3-fold  of  wild-type 
responded with -0.42 to -0.72 log10 decreases in HIV RNA through week 24 and maintained a similar 
response through week 48. 
The more zidovudine-associated mutations (also know as thymidine-analogue-associated mutations or 
TAM) were present at baseline, the less was the virological response to tenofovir DF. However, even 
with  more  than  4-fold  zidovudine-associated  mutations,  a  mean  3-fold  reduced  susceptibility  to 
tenofovir was reported in both studies. 
An  integrated  analysis  of  the  effects  of  pre-existing  baseline  ZDV  resistance  mutations  has  been 
performed  for  both  studies  (n  =  80  in  study  902  and  n  =  253  in  study  907).  The  ZDV  mutations 
included in this analysis were M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F and K219Q/E/N. Patients with 
HIV  expressing  the  D67N,  K70R  or  K219Q/E/N  mutations  responded  to  tenofovir  DF  300  mg 
similarly  to  those  patients  without  these  mutations.  In  contrast,  patients  with  HIV  expressing  the 
M41L, L210W or T215Y/F mutations showed diminished responses, although all of these responses 
were  statistically  significant  when  compared  to  placebo  patients  with  the  same  mutations  (Table  5). 
Upon further analysis, only the M41L and L210W mutations were uniquely associated with reduced 
responses as patients expressing T215Y/F in the absence of M41L or L210W had a mean HIV RNA 
response of -0.70 log10 copies/ml (n=25).

The effect of the number of baseline ZDV mutations was also analysed. Patients with HIV expressing 
no ZDV mutations or just 1 or 2 mutations had mean HIV RNA responses of greater than -0.66 log10 
copies/ml (Table 6). It was confirmed that HIV RNA responses to tenofovir DF were  diminished in 
the presence of >3 of the defined ZDV mutations. However, a specific effect of the M41L or L210W 
mutations was also observed among these patients.

In the absence of either of these mutations, patients with HIV expressing >3 ZDV mutations had an 
HIV RNA response of -0.67 log10 copies/ml (Table 6). In the presence of M41L or L210W, responses 
in patients with >3 ZDV mutations were diminished (-0.21 log10 copies/ml) but were still statistically 
superior to placebo patients with the same mutations (p=0.0126). Thus, it appears that the magnitude 
of  the  response  to  tenofovir  DF  therapy  depends  on  both  the  number  and  specific  type  of  ZDV 
mutations present at baseline.

In studies 902 and 907, patients with HIV expressing the M184V mutation showed stronger responses 
to 
-0.65  versus  
-0.48  log10  copies/ml  and  -0.64  versus  -0.40  log10  copies/ml  respectively.  However,  when  the  net 
effect  from  the  placebo  group  was  subtracted  and  other  RT  mutations  considered,  results  were  not 
statistically  significantly  different.  Phenotypic  analysis  showed  an  approximate  2-fold  increase  in 
tenofovir  susceptibility  associated  with  the  M184V  mutation  among  all  analysed  patients  or  among 
those patients with baseline zidovudine resistance mutations. Although suggestive, these data do not 
firmly  demonstrate  hypersusceptibility  to  tenofovir  of  viral  strains  harbouring  the  184  mutation. 
Development of nucleoside associated RT mutations 
in 
The  analysis  of  development  of  resistance  to  NRTIs  in  tenofovir-treated  patients  led  to  different 
results between studies 902 and 907.  
In  the  post-baseline  genotypic  analysis  of  the  virology  substudy  902,  a  trend  to  a  higher  rate  of 
mutations in the RT gene was observed in patients treated with tenofovir. Overall, 26 % and 43 % of 
patients in the tenofovir group developed RT mutations at weeks 24 and 48 respectively as compared 
to  14  %  of  patients  developing  RT  mutations 
the  placebo  group  at  week  24.  
This proportion was particularly high in the 150 mg treatment arm (37 % and 57 % of patients at 24 
and  48  weeks  respectively).  The  majority  of  the  patients  (63  of  79)  developed 
typical 
zidovudine-associated mutations while taking either zidovudine, stavudine, or abacavir concomitantly.   
By contrast the post-baseline genotypic data of study 907, revealed that, at week 24, fewer patients in 
the  tenofovir  DF  treatment  arm  developed  nucleoside-associated  RT  mutations  compared  to  the 
placebo arm though this difference was not statistically significant (15 % versus 22 %, respectively). 
Overall  data  showed  a  statistically  significant  mean  HIV  RNA  decrease  of  - 0.41  log10  copies/ml  at 
week 24, suggesting that tenofovir DF still had an anti-HIV activity despite the development of these 
mutations. Phenotypic analysis showed that in those patients that developed new mutations to NRTI at 
24  week  of  treatment,  mean  fold  change  in  tenofovir  susceptibility  (as  compared  to  basal 
susceptibility) was 2.5 fold in the tenofovir arm and 1.2 fold in the placebo group. This change is just 
at the limit of what is considered a threshold of low resistance level (> 2.5-3 fold) that represents the 
inter-assay variation of the phenotypic test.

Selection of HIV-1 virus with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir 
The  development  of  primary  resistance  mutations  to tenofovir was infrequent  and only 4 patients  in 
study  902  and  5  in  study  907  developed  K65R  mutation.  This  mutation  was  associated  with  low 
phenotypic resistance  (2.8  to  3.9-fold increased IC50  of the  wild  type HIV-1).  Among the 5 patients 
with  K65R  mutation  in  study  907,  there  was  a  high  variation  in  response  to  tenofovir  DF  therapy  
(- 1.10 to + 0.72 log10 copies/ml).  
Owing to the limited number of patients as well as the co-administered regimen therapies, the impact 
of the K65R mutation is currently unknown. 
Limited  data  showed  that  reduction  in  tenofovir  susceptibility  during  tenofovir  treatment  was 
generally not associated with viral rebound (4 in 12 patients who had > 2.5 fold change in tenofovir 
susceptibility) and if any, the rebound was not associated with genetic changes.

The  K65R  mutation  was  associated  with  a  mean  3.7-fold  reduction  in  susceptibility  to  tenofovir.   
This  was  the  only  mutation  identified  that  was  associated  with  decreased  susceptibility  to  tenofovir. 
The  virologic  failure  in  patients  treated  with  TDV/3TC/EFV  regimen  was  mainly  due  to  NNRTI-
associated or 3TC resistance mutations. 
At this stage, considering the limited number of patients who develop the K65R mutation (n=7) and 
that phenotypic resistance does not correlate with virological response, the CPMP could not draw any 
conclusion. 
Clarifications on the relation of genotypic and phenotypic resistance specifically in terms of the K65R 
mutation on the predictability of clinical efficacy of second line treatment in case of virological failure 
is to be provided and analysed. The 144 weeks data of the ongoing 903 study are awaited to further 
assess the response to subsequent treatments in patients receiving tenofovir and developing the K65R 
mutation.  
A  recommendation  has  been  added  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  to  not  introduce 
tenofovir  in  antiretroviral  experienced  patients  with  strains  harbouring  the  K65R  mutation. 
Pharmacodynamic/Pharmacokinetic relation 
The  correlation  between  the  decrease  in  viral  load  and  tenofovir  intracellular  concentrations  is 
currently unknown but will be further evaluated as part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-
authorisation. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  tenofovir  DF  was  determined  after  single  and  multiple  doses  of 
tenofovir and tenofovir DF administered intravenously and orally, in HIV-1 infected patients (n = 93) 
and  healthy  volunteers  (n  =  143),  respectively.  The  pharmacokinetics  development  comprises  the 
following Phase I/II clinical studies: 
17/43 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
•  Study 914: bioequivalence and food study in healthy volunteers 
•  Study 909: interaction study in healthy volunteers 
•  Study  701:  pharmacokinetic  and  efficacy  evaluation  in  naïve  and  experienced  patients 
following intravenous infusion over 1 hour 
•  Study  919:  pharmacokinetic  in  non  HIV-infected  subjects  with  normal  renal  function,  or 
with  varying  degrees  of  renal  impairment,  including  subjects  undergoing  haemodialysis 
(submitted and assessed post-authorisation) 
Pharmacokinetic data in patients were also obtained from clinical studies 901 and 907. 
Two validated HPLC assays, including a more sensitive assay using a mass spectrometric detection, 
were used for measurements of tenofovir in human serum and urine. The pharmacokinetic profile was 
determined  with  doses  ranging  from  1  and  3  mg/kg,  when  administered  intravenously,  and  75  to 
600 mg, when administered orally. 
Absorption and distribution 
Because tenofovir had a low bioavailability due to the presence of a phosphonate group that makes it 
negatively charged at neutral pH, tenofovir DF was developed.  
After single oral administration in fasted state, tenofovir DF was rapidly absorbed, with time to peak 
concentration  (Tmax)  of  approximately  1  hour,  and  converted  to  tenofovir.  Serum  tenofovir  levels 
decreased in a biphasic manner with a terminal half-life between 12 and 15 hours, allowing for a once 
daily dose regimen.  
The  bioavailability  from  urinary  excretion  was  estimated  to  be  equivalent  to  15-25  %,  following  a 
single dose of tenofovir DF 300 mg in fasted patients. High fat food had a significant impact on the 
bioavailability, increasing it by approximately 30 to 40 %.  After a high fat meal, Tmax was delayed by 
approximately  1  hour  and  Cmax  was  enhanced  by  14  %  (335  ng/ml  in  fed  state  versus  296  ng/ml  in 
fasted state, respectively). Therefore it is recommended to take tenofovir DF with food as mentioned 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics. However, administration of tenofovir DF with a light meal 
did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  was  dose-proportional  after  intravenous  and  oral  administration  within 
the range 75 to 600 mg. Most of the pharmacokinetic parameters after tenofovir administration seemed 
to be independent of the dose with the exception of the terminal half-life, which consistently increased 
over time. In addition repeated intravenous administration of 3 mg/kg tenofovir resulted in an apparent 
reduction  of  the  serum  and  renal  clearances.  However  no  clinically  relevant  dose  accumulation  was 
reported.  
In vitro study demonstrated that tenofovir is practically unbound to plasma proteins (0.7 % in human 
plasma). Following single intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg, volume of distribution 
averaged 0.8 to 1 l/kg at steady state.  
Metabolism and elimination 
Following  absorption,  tenofovir  DF  is  rapidly  converted  to  tenofovir,  which  is  then  metabolised 
intracellularly to the active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate.  No other metabolite than tenofovir and 
tenofovir soproxil were identified.  
As  already  mentioned  in  the  Pharmaco-toxicological  part  of  this  document  in  vitro  studies  showed 
that,  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations,  tenofovir  and  tenofovir  DF  did  not  inhibit  or  induce  the 
major  CYP-450  isoforms  (CYP  3A4;  2D6;  2C9;  2E1  and  1A2).  However,  in  vitro,  tenofovir  DF 
induced CYP 1A1 and 2B. 
The  terminal  elimination  half-life  of tenofovir in  serum  averaged approximately 17-18  hours,  which 
together  with  the  long  intracellular  half-life  in  PBMC  (>  24  hours)  supports  once  daily  dosing. 
Tenofovir DF was mainly eliminated renally as unchanged tenofovir, and represented more than 80 % 
of  the  administered  dose  after  repeated  intravenous  administration  of  3  mg/kg.  The  estimated  mean 
18/43 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
renal clearance (160 ml/hr/kg) exceeds creatinine clearance (~ 75 ml/hr/kg) indicating that tenofovir is 
eliminated  by  glomerular  secretion  and  active  tubular  secretion,  which  confirmed  the  pre-clinical 
observations. 
After oral administration, 17 % to 23 % of the administrated dose is recovered unchanged in urine in 
the fasted and fed state, respectively.  
A subgroup analysis of study 903 in antiretroviral naïve patients, showed no relevant gender or ethnic 
influence on the virological response to tenofovir. This analysis supports previous conclusions derived 
from subgroup analysis performed in study 907, in antiretroviral experienced patients (combining 903 
and 907 studies, where efficacy data are derived from 170 non Caucasians and 100 females).  
Special population 
• 
Patients with hepatic impaired function 
Tenofovir  and  tenofovir  DF  are  not  metabolised  by  liver  enzymes.  Although  minimal  impact  of 
hepatic  impairment  is  expected,  a  phase  I,  open-label,  parallel-group  study  evaluating  the 
pharmacokinetics of tenofovir following administration of a single dose of tenofovir DF 300 mg in 24 
fasted non-HIV infected adults subjects with normal and impaired hepatic function (3 groups with 8 
subjects  in  each  group:  normal  hepatic  function,  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment)  has  been 
undertaken, to determine whether Viread specific dosing recommendations are needed in patients with 
hepatic impairment.  
Subjects  with  hepatic  impairment  were  stratified  using  the  Child-Pugh-Turcotte  (CPT)  classification 
system. The groups studied were subjects with moderate (CPT class B – CPT score: 7-9) and severe 
(CPT  class  C  -CPT  score  >  9)  hepatic  impairment  caused  by  viral-induced  (non-hepatitis  B)  liver 
cirrhosis. The control group consisted of healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function. 
Systemic  exposures  of  tenofovir  were  quite  similar  in  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment 
(AUC0-t  and  AUC0-∞  were  +15%  to  +16%)  and  slightly  increased  in  subjects  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment (AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ +31% to +37%), relative to subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Overall,  tenofovir  exposures  (AUC0-∞)  were  not  substantially  altered  in  the  subjects  with  hepatic 
impairment.  The  slight  increase  in  tenofovir  exposure  in  patients  with  marked  hepatic  impairment 
does not justify any dosing adjustment with regard to hepatic function.  
Appropriate recommendations have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

tenofovir DF following administration of tenofovir DF 300 mg in subjects with normal renal function

Haemodialysis subjects 
The  median  extraction  coefficient  of  the  dialyzer,  was  approximately  54%  and  the  median  serum 
haemodialysis  clearance  was  134  ml/min.    By  measuring  the  amount  of  tenofovir  recovered  in 
dialysate  during  haemodialysis,  10%  (range  2%  to  16%)  of  the  tenofovir  DF  dose  (as  determined 
using  135.6 mg  of  tenofovir  contained  in  a  300 mg  dose  of  tenofovir  DF)  was  removed  during 
haemodialysis.    In  comparison,  20%  of  an  administered  dose  of  tenofovir  was  recovered  in 
nonhaemodialysis subjects over a 96-hour urine collection period.   
Assuming a similar relative oral bioavailability in haemodialysis subjects, this corresponds to removal 
of  approximately  50%  of  the  estimated  orally  bioavailable  dose  of  tenofovir  in  a  300 mg  dose  of 
tenofovir DF, indicating the efficiency with which haemodialysis removes tenofovir from the serum. 
Pharmacokinetic modeling and dosing recommendations  
Using  a  two-compartment  model,  tenofovir  concentrations  profiles  at  steady  state  were  simulated  to 
predict exposures, following both once daily dosing and with longer dosing intervals, in subjects with 
moderate or severe renal impairment. 
The PK modelling estimations showed that, in subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment, a 
once  daily  dosing  of  tenofovir  DF  300  mg  resulted  in  a  significant  accumulation  of  tenofovir  (e.g. 
median  simulated  tenofovir  Ctrough  values  of  123  and  482  ng/ml  respectively,  representing 
approximately  
221  and  865%  (relative  ratio)  higher  trough  concentrations  compared  with  subjects  with  
CLcr  ≥50ml/min).  
Considering  the  results  of  the  modeling,  the  following  dosing  interval  adjustments  are  proposed  in

Since Viread is only available as a 245 mg tablet, recommendations for subjects with renal impairment 
are  only  based  on  adjustment  to  the  dosing  interval.  Revised  guidance,  which  would  refer  to  dose 
reduction rather than increase in dosing interval, is pending further investigations of alternative dosage 
formulations. 
Recommendations  have  been  included  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  as  follows:  
“The  proposed  dose  interval  modifications  are  based  on  limited  data  and  may  not  be  optimal.   
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  these  dosing  interval  adjustment  guidelines  have  not  been  clinically 
evaluated.  Therefore, clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in 
these patients”. 
No dosing recommendations could be drawn for non-haemodialysis patients with creatinine clearance 
< 10 ml/min. 
Interaction studies  
As above mentioned, in vitro studies demonstrated that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not a substrate 
for  major  isoforms  of  CYP450  system,  apart  from  its  effect  on  CYP2B  and  CYP1A1.  
Metabolic interactions with substrates, inhibitors or any substances affected by this enzymatic system, 
including most protease inhibitors or non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are therefore not 
expected.  Interaction  study  agents  representative  of  the  three  antiretroviral  classes  (NRTIs,  PIs  and 
NNRTIs) was carried out. 
•  Antiretroviral agents 
In study 909, potential  interactions between tenofovir DF administered at 300  mg once  daily during  
7  days  with 
indinavir, 
lopinavir/ritonavir and efavirenz were evaluated. This was a multiple dose, crossover, open label and 
randomised study conducted in male and female healthy volunteers.  
lamivudine,  didanosine  administered  as  chewable  buffered 
tablet, 
Moreover,  study  932,  was  conducted  to  evaluate  whether  the  pharmacokinetics  of  didanosine, 
administered as 400 mg enteric coated gastro resistant capsules and the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir 
DF  with  a  light  meal  were  affected  by  their  co-administration.  Neither  lamivudine  nor  didanosine 
administration had any significant impact on tenofovir DF pharmacokinetic parameters. Tenofovir DF 
decreased Cmax and delayed Tmax of lamivudine although no difference in lamivudine exposure was 
reported.  On  the  other  hand,  when  didanosine  gastro-resistant  capsules  were  administered  2  hours 
prior  to  or  concurrently  with  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  the  AUC  for  didanosine  was  on  average 
increased by 48% and 60% respectively. The mean increase in the AUC of didanosine was 44% when 
the  buffered  tablets  were  administered  1  hour  prior  to  tenofovir.  In  both  cases  the  pharmacokinetic 
parameters for tenofovir administered with a light meal were unchanged.  
Since  didanosine  is  also  secreted  at  the  proximal  tubule  of  the  kidney,  there  is  a  competition  for 
elimination. During the clinical studies where 30% of patients received tenofovir DF in combination 
with  antiretroviral  regimen  containing  didanosine,  there  was  no  evidence  of  a  higher  incidence  of 
pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy or associated laboratory abnormalities. No recommendation could 
be drawn at this stage with regard to a specific dosage adjustment when these medicinal products are 
co-administered but close monitoring for didanosine-related adverse events, including, but not limited 
to, pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy was recommended, as indicated in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics.  
Indinavir had a minor but not clinically relevant effect on Cmax and Tmax of tenofovir DF. Tenofovir 
DF delayed the Tmax (1.42 versus 0.99 hours respectively) and reduced the Cmax of indinavir with no 
significant reduction in indinavir exposure. Although no pharmacokinetic interactions were observed 
with indinavir, the risk of decrease in tenofovir renal clearance when co-administered with indinavir 
should be considered in patients susceptible to develop nephrotoxicity. A warning has therefore been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Co-administration  of  tenofovir  DF  with  lopinavir/ritonavir  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant 
increase in tenofovir DF mean serum concentrations (Cmax and AUC0-t increased by approximately 
21/43 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
30  %).  By  contrast,  tenofovir  induced  a  slight  reduction  in  the  exposure  to  lopinavir/ritonavir, 
although Cmin of lopinavir remained unchanged (Cmax and AUC0-t of lopinavir reduced by 15 %). 
The  co-administration  resulted  also  in  a  statistically  significant  lower  mean  peak  of  ritonavir 
concentrations  (both  Cmax  and  AUC0-t  decreased  by  30  %)  and  Tmax  was  unchanged.  
The mechanism for this unexpected interaction and the clinical relevance of these results are currently 
unknown but will be further investigated post-authorisation. 
•  Other medicinal products 
Since in vitro interaction study showed that tenofovir DF induced CYP2B and that co-administration 
with  methadone  (metabolized  by  CYP2B6)  may  be  required  in  practice,  the  applicant  undertook  to 
further investigate this potential interaction. 
As  tenofovir  DF  is  primarily  excreted  renally,  there  may  be  potential  increased  concentrations  of 
tenofovir and/or medicinal products that decrease or compete for renal clearance (including those with 
the  same  renal  transporter  hOAT1)  when  co-administrated.  These  should  therefore  not  be  
co-administered  unless  necessary  (with  monitoring  of  the  renal  function)  as  recommended  in  the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.  
Bioequivalence 
The intended commercial formulation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (1 x 300 mg tablet) was shown 
to be bioequivalent to the formulation used during the clinical development (4 x 75 mg). 
Clinical Efficacy  
Study 901: Phase I/II dose ranging study in naïve and pre-treated patients  
The antiviral clinical efficacy was evaluated in the following clinical studies: 
• 
•  Study 902: Phase II, 48 weeks duration as double blind, in antiretroviral experienced patients 
•  Study 907: Phase III, 48 weeks duration including 24 weeks as double blind and 24 weeks open, in 
antiretroviral experienced patients.  
•  Study 903: Phase III, 144 weeks duration as double blind, in antiretroviral naïve patients.  
In both studies 902 and 907, after 48 weeks treatment period,  patients remaining on tenofovir could 
continue into open-label protocols. 
Results from studies 902 and 907 were provided to support the efficacy of tenofovir DF administered 
in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral  agents  for  the  treatment  experienced  HIV  infected  patients 
with  detectable  viral  load.  They  were  designed  as  intensification,  placebo  controlled  studies  where 
tenofovir DF was added to stable background antiretroviral treatment.  
At  the  time  of  the  submission  of  the  application,  efficacy  results  for  48  weeks  and  24  weeks  of 
treatment were available for study 902 and 907 respectively. In addition interim data up to 96 weeks 
for patients continuing the long-term open label protocol of study 902, were presented. The efficacy 
results of study 907 for 48 weeks of treatment have been assessed post authorisation. 
In  addition,  the  48  weeks  efficacy  data  of  study  903  have  been  also  submitted  post-marketing 
authorisation to support the efficacy of tenofovir DF administered in combination with lamivudine and 
efavirenz compared with the combination of stavudine, lamivudine and efavirenz, in treatment naïve 
HIV  infected  patients,  including  43%  of  patients  with  high  viral  load  (>  100,000  copies/ml).  
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies  
Dose response study 
Pre-clinical toxicology studies supported the evaluation of 75 mg daily as the initial dose. Study 901 
was  the  first  dose  ranging  study  of  tenofovir  DF.  The  design  of  the  study  is  described  in  table  10.

The antiviral effect of tenofovir was dose proportional up to 300 mg. At day 35, a significantly greater 
decrease  in  HIV-1  RNA  levels  was  observed  in  all  active  treatment  groups  compared  to  placebo.  
The  greatest  median  decrease in HIV-1  RNA  occurred in the  group who  received tenofovir DF  300 
mg compared to placebo (-0.85 log10 copies/ml versus – 0.01 log10 copies/ml respectively, p = 0.036,  
ITT  population  n  =  59).  No  additional  antiviral  effect  was  evidenced  with  the  600  mg  dose  
(- 0.80 log10 copies/ml, p = 0.0002 versus placebo, ITT population). At day 35, naïve patients seemed 
to  have  greater  decreases  in  HIV-1  RNA  levels  compared  to  experienced  patients  (-  1.57  versus  
–  0.61  log10  copies/ml  in  the  300  mg  tenofovir  DF  arm  and  –1.40  versus  –  0.97  log10  copies/ml  in  
600  mg  tenofovir  DF  group).  The  addition  of  hydroxyurea  to  tenofovir  DF  did  not  provide  any 
additional  antiviral  effect.  No  real  improvement  in  CD4  cell  counts  was  observed  in  any  of  the 
treatment groups. 
Using a four parameters logistic model, doses of 300 mg and 600 mg were estimated to provide 90 % 
and  99  %  of  the  maximal  antiviral  effect,  defined  as  -1.0  log10  copies/ml  with  a  dose  of  115  mg 
representing 50 % of the maximal effect.   
HIV RNA levels obtained in Part C and the extended dosing phase seemed to be maintained however 
the results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample sized in each cohort (between  
3  and  7  patients),  the  absence  of  controlled  group  and  the  potential  impact  of  highly  active 
antiretroviral treatment that patients started on.  
Although the exposition was limited, tenofovir DF 300 mg seemed to be well tolerated in the extended 
phase (> 1 year). Gastro-intestinal disorders such as diarrhoea were the most common adverse events 
reported.

following  oral  administration  was  observed  and  the  long  terminal  half-life  supported  a  once  daily 
dosage regimen.  Although the sample size is limited, particularly in the 600 mg dose group, the dose 
of  300  mg  daily  was  supported  by  a  significant  viral  load  decrease  compared  to  placebo  with  an 
acceptable  safety  profile.  Results  from  study  902,  presented  below  further  substantiated  the  dose  of

The  sample  size  of  study  902  was  calculated  on  the  basis  of  safety  rather  than  efficacy  criteria 
(difference in the proportion of patients in each of the treatment groups with Grade 3 or higher adverse 
events). 
In  both  studies,  patients  were  stratified  according  to  HIV-RNA  levels  (<  20,000  copies/ml  and  
≥  20,000  copies/ml  for  study  902  and  <  or  ≥  5,000  copies/ml  for  study  907),  CD4  cell  counts  
(<  or  ≥  200  cells/ml)  and  number  of  antiretroviral  products  prior  to  study  entry  (<  4  or  ≥  4). 
In study 902, patients were encouraged to continue their baseline antiretroviral treatment, in addition 
to  the  assigned  study  compound  for  at  least  4  weeks  post-randomisation.  Thereafter  changes  in  the 
background antiretroviral therapy were allowed (addition of a new antiretroviral agent, discontinuation 
of  background  antiretroviral  agent  or  clinically  relevant  interruption  for  30  days  or  more).  
The  criterion  used  in  deciding  to  change  the  background  therapy  was  the  viral  load  level  remaining 
above  the  limit  of  quantification  at  week  12  following  randomisation.  By  contrast,  the  protocol  of 
study  907  encouraged  no  changes  in  the  background  antiretroviral  treatment  for  at  least  24  weeks  
post-randomisation. 
Although this medicinal product was developed before the revision of the Points to Consider for the 
assessment  of  an  anti-HIV  medicinal  product  (CPMP/602/95  rev.3),  the  development  is  in  line  with 
the  spirit  of  the  recommendations.  Indeed,  the  design  corresponds  to  an  intensification  therapy,  
the  population  enrolled  is  antiretroviral  multi-experienced  with  extensive  resistance  at  baseline.  
24/43 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Even if this population does not correspond to a deep salvage, it is in accordance with the definition of 
the early failure described in the Points to Consider document.  
Endpoints/assays 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  treatment  effect  on  viral  load  as  measured  by  the  time-
weighted average change from baseline of log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA levels up to week 24 (DAVG24). 
In study 902, the DAVG up to week 4 (DAVG4) was a co-primary endpoint. 
The secondary endpoints were: 
• 
• 
DAVG up to week 48 post-randomisation (DAVG48)  
the  proportion  of  patients  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  levels  at  or  below  quantification  limits  
(≤ 400 copies/ml and ≤ 50 copies/ml) during the study period 
CD4 cell counts measured by mean change from baseline and DAVG 
• 
In both studies, genotypic and phenotypic analyses were performed in a subset of patients as already 
discussed in the Clinical Pharmacovigilance section of this document. 
Statistical analysis 
For  the  DAVG  analysis  of  viral  load  and  CD4  cell  counts,  DAVG(t)  is  defined  as  the  patient  time-
weighted average value of log10 copies/ml or CD4 cell counts between the first visit post start of the 
study medication and week t, minus the baseline average. 
For both studies, primary efficacy analyses were performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, 
which included all patients who were randomised and received at least one dose of study medication, 
with no data exclusion. Analysis of several secondary endpoints was also performed on an “as-treated” 
population (AT), which included all patients who received at least one dose of study medication but 
excluded  all  data  after  discontinuation  of  assigned  medication  and/or  addition  of  other  antiretroviral 
therapy.

For both studies, the baseline characteristics were well balanced between the tenofovir and the placebo 
treatment groups. 
The majority of patients in study 902 had AIDS or symptomatic HIV-1 infection (for instance, 59 % 
of  patients  in  the  tenofovir  DF  300  mg  group  compared  to  41  %  of  patients  asymptomatic).  
Of  note,  52  %  of  all  tenofovir  patients  had  less  than  5,000  copies/ml  and  94  %  of  patients  had 
mutations associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors at baseline.  
The  population  in  907  consisted  mainly  in  asymptomatic  patients  (50  %)  with  limited  viral  load, 
including 78 % with a viral load less than 5,000 copies/ml, but a significant antiretroviral experience 
(overall mean duration of prior antiretroviral therapy was 5.4 ± 2.9 years). In addition 87 % of patients 
had a mean CD4 cell count at baseline above 200 cells/mm3. Overall, 17 % of patients were naïve to 
PI and 41 % had not been previously exposed to NNRTIs. The current antiretroviral regimen duration 
was 3.8 ± 2.19 years in the tenofovir DF group and 3.6 ± 2.03 years in the placebo group and consisted 
mainly in PI + NRTI in both groups (43 % in tenofovir DF and 48 % in placebo groups respectively). 
As  for  study  902,  94  %  of  patients  had  mutations  associated  with  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase 
inhibitors at baseline. 
In  both  studies,  the  baseline  characteristics  of  the  patients  suggested  that  patients  were  treatment 
experienced and in early virological failure rather than as in true therapeutic failure to their baseline 
therapy.  
Discontinuation 
The  percentage  of  treatment  discontinuation  was  limited  in  both  studies  and  accounted  for  14  %  in 
study 902 (25 % versus 11 % in the placebo and tenofovir DF 300 mg groups, respectively) and 6 % in 
study 907 (6 % in both placebo and tenofovir DF groups). Even during the open label phase of study 
907, study drug discontinuation occurred rarely.

The  main  reasons  for  discontinuation  pertained  to  occurrence  of  adverse  events/intercurrent  illness  
(5 % in study 902 and 3 % in study 907) and lost of follow-up (3 % in study 902 and less than 1 % in 
study 907).

a p-value versus placebo, Wilcoxon rank sum test, not stratified 
b 21 of the 28 patients originally randomised to placebo crossed over to 300 mg, per protocol; this group is a non- randomised 
group 
Results  demonstrated  statistically  significant  changes  from  baseline  in  HIV-1  RNA  for  each  of  the 
treatment  groups  compared  to  placebo,  but  at  all  time  points,  the  300  mg  group  achieved  the 
maximum mean antiviral effect. The antiviral effect of tenofovir DF 300 mg added to a background 
therapy provided therefore a limited but clinically relevant effect on viral load as compared to placebo 
(- 0.58 log10 copies/ml at 24 weeks and - 0.61 log10 copies/ml at 48 weeks).  
In  the  AT  population,  results  were  consistent  except  for  the  median  value  of  DAVG48  
(- 0.39 log10 copies/ml versus 0.15 log10 copies/ml in the placebo arm, p < 0.001).  
In  a  subanalysis,  the  virological  impact  of  tenofovir  was  more  pronounced  in  patients  with  baseline 
viral  load  ≤  5,000  copies/ml  compared  to  those  with  viral  load  >  5,000  copies/ml.  Indeed  for  the  
300 mg arm, DAVG24 accounted for – 0.68 log10 copies/ml in patients with baseline ≤ 5,000 copies/ml 
compared to – 0.47 log10 copies/ml in patients with baseline > 5,000 copies/ml. The analysis was not 
performed  according  to  the  planned  stratification  (<  or  ≥  20,000  copies/ml)  and  the  size  of  the 
subgroup study was too limited to draw firm conclusions. 
Antiviral  activity  was  sustained  through  48  weeks.  The  DAVG48  value  in  patients  with  less  than  
4  medications  in  baseline  background  therapy  for  the  tenofovir  DF  300  mg  group  was  –  0.61  log10 
copies/ml compared to – 0.63 log10 copies/ml in patients with 4 medications.

Secondary endpoints 
A greater, but not significant, viral load reduction from baseline was observed in the highest tenofovir 
DF group (- 0.63 log10 copies/ml at week 4 and – 0.68 log10 copies/ml at week 24, ITT population). 
 This  study  was  however  not  powered  to  detect  any  significant  differences  between  the  groups  in 
terms of proportion of patients with undetectable viral load. In the ITT population, where missing data 
equal to treatment failure, the proportion of patients with plasma HIV RNA ≤ 400 copies/ml was 26 % 
in the tenofovir DF 300 mg group versus 21 % in the placebo group.  
Similarly, tenofovir DF treatment did not have any impact on CD4 cell counts compared to placebo. 
Changes to background therapy 
Changes  were consistent  across  all the groups. The  majority of changes  consisted  of the  addition of 
another antiretroviral agent to the background therapy. Differences between all the groups in time to 
first  change  to  background  therapy  were  not  statistically  significant  using  Kaplan-Meier  estimates 
(21.3 weeks in the placebo group versus 19.3 weeks in the tenofovir DF 300 mg group). The ITT and 
AT  population  efficacy  results  were  similar,  reinforcing  the  limited  impact  of  the  changes  in  the 
demonstration  of  the  efficacy  of  tenofovir  DF  (DAVG24  for  the  300  mg  group  equivalent  to  –0.58 
log10 copies/ml versus – 0.52 log10 copies/ml respectively).  
Long- term data 
During  the  open  label  phase,  where  all  patients  were  switched  to  tenofovir  DF  300  mg  (n  =  135),  
the  antiviral  response  seemed  to  be  sustained  up  to  96  weeks.  At  96  weeks,  the  mean  change  from 
baseline in plasma HIV RNA was – 0.98 log10 copies/ml in the group who received 300 mg tenofovir 
DF throughout the study duration (ITT population).  
Study 907 
Primary endpoint 
The  mean  time-weighted  average  change  from  baseline  in  viral  load  was  significantly  greater  for 
tenofovir DF compared to placebo at all time points assessed. During the open-label phase (up to week 
48), decreases from baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels continued at all time points. After 24 weeks of 
treatment,  using  the  ITT  population,  the  mean  time-weighted  average  change  from  baseline  in  viral 
load of the tenofovir DF 300 mg group was significantly greater than that of the placebo group, with a 
sustained virological response after 48 weeks of treatment, as shown in table 14.

In term of changes in viral load from baseline, tenofovir DF induced a limited but relevant decrease 
compared to placebo (- 0.61 log10 copies/ml versus – 0.03 log10 copies/ml at 24 weeks).  Efficacy data 
obtained after 48 weeks of treatment show a sustained virological response in the Tenofovir DF group 
(DAVG 24 = -0.61 log10 copies/mL and DAVG 48 =-0.57 log10 copies/mL). 
Subgroup analysis 
The benefit of tenofovir DF treatment on plasma HIV RNA levels was observed in patients with both 
viral basal load above and below 5,000 copies/ml. The proportion of patients achieving undetectable 
viral  load  was  lower  in  patients  who  had  a  viral  load  ≥  5,000  copies/ml  at  baseline  as  compared  to 
patients with < 5,000 copies/ml (15 % versus 55 % with HIV RNA ≤ 400 copies/ml and 5 % versus  
28  % with HIV RNA ≤ 50 copies/ml at week 24, respectively). However it is difficult to draw firm 
conclusion since 78 % of patients had a viral load < 5,000 copies/ml at baseline. Similarly, the benefit 
of tenofovir was less favourable in patients with a basal immunological status less than 200 cells/mm3. 
Secondary endpoints 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  HIV-1  RNA  below  the  limit  of  quantification  (≤  400  and  
≤ 50 copies/ml) was significantly greater in the tenofovir DF groups compared to placebo by the time 
of  the  first  on-treatment  assessment  at  week  2,  and  at  all  subsequent  time  points.  At  24  weeks,  
45  %  of  patients  in  the  tenofovir  DF  group  had  a  viral  load  below  400  copies/ml  compared  to  
13 % in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). Using the limit of quantification 50 copies/ml, there were still 
22  %  of  patients  versus  1  %  in  the  placebo  group  with  undetectable  viral  load  (p  <  0.0001).  
At week 48, the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA levels <400 copies/ml and HIV-1 RNA levels 
<50  copies/ml  (41%  and  18%  respectively  in  the  tenofovir  DF  group)    confirmed  that  the  antiviral 
response  to  Viread  was  durable  through  48  weeks:  Since  patients  who  met  the  inclusion  criteria  of 
HIV-1  RNA  ≥  400  copies/ml  were  randomised  within  21  days  after  screening,  some  were  found  to 
have less than 400 copies/ml at baseline (8 % (31/368) in tenofovir DF group and 5 % (9/182) in the 
placebo group).  At week 48, 22 of the 31 (71%) patients of the tenofovir DF group who were found to 
have baseline HIV RNA <400 copies/ml, had a sustained undetectable viral load which reflects that 
the lower the viral load is at baseline, the more sustained the virological response to tenofovir.  
No  clear  immunological  impact  of  tenofovir  on  CD4  cell  counts  could  be  demonstrated.  Only  the 
time-weighted average change from baseline analysis, at week 24, indicated a statistically significant 
difference  between  the  tenofovir  DF  and  the  placebo  groups  (+  12 .6  versus  -10.6  respectively, 
 p  =  0.0008).  A  similar  trend  was  shown  at  48  weeks  with  a  limited  change  from  baseline  
(+12.5 cells/mm3). 
Change in background antiretroviral medications while on study prior to week 24 
The  proportions of patients having a change in background antiretroviral therapy during the double-
blind phase were similar in the tenofovir DF group (11 %) and the placebo group (11 %) (p = 0.89). 
For those patients who had a change, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the 
proportion  receiving  a  new  antiretroviral  medication  (p  =  0.38)  and  the  proportion  discontinuing  a 
baseline  medication  and  not  receiving  a  new  antiretroviral  medication  (p  =  0.35).  Up  to  week  48, 
changes  in  background  therapy  were  reported  for  93/368  patients  (25%)  in  the  tenofovir  DF  group.  
In 67 patients (18%), the change was the addition of a new antiretroviral medication. 
Because  changes  to  background  antiretroviral  therapies  were  discouraged,  the  weekly  proportion  of 
patients discontinuing treatment was low in each arm during the first 24 weeks, ranging from 0 % to 
4%. When focusing on the time to first new antiretroviral medication added during the double blind 
phase up to week 24, the proportion of patients was lower in the tenofovir arm than in the placebo arm 
although not statistically significant (21 % versus 7 %, Kaplan Meier estimate p = 0.87). In addition, 
the ITT and AT population 24 weeks efficacy results were similar, reinforcing the limited impact of 
the  changes  in  the  demonstration  of  the  efficacy  of  tenofovir  DF  (DAVG24  for  the  300  mg  group 
equivalent to –0.61 log10 copies/ml versus – 0.62 log10 copies/ml respectively).

Endpoints/assays 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  equivalence  of  both  regimens  in  the  treatment  of  HIV-1  infected 
antiretroviral-naive  patients  as  determined  by  the  proportion  of  patients  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA 
levels < 400 copies/ml at week 48. 
The secondary endpoints were: 
• 
To assess  the equivalence  of the two treatment regimens with respect to the ability to 
achieve HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/ml at week 48, 
• 
To compare the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of the two treatment regimens through 
144 weeks of exposure (analyses conducted at weeks 48, 96, and 144). 
Statistical analysis 
A two-sided 95% confidence interval on the difference in treatment group response rates (tenofovir-
containing arm minus stavudine-containing arm) weighted by baseline HIV-RNA and CD4 strata was 
constructed.  A “delta” of 0.10 was chosen for the definition of equivalence.  
The  tenofovir-containing  arm  would  be  declared  equivalent  to  the  stavudine-containing  arm  if  the 
lower confidence bound for the difference between the arms in the proportion with HIV-1 RNA below 
400 copies/ml was greater than -0.10. 
Patients  missing  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  values  at  week  48  and  patients  who  added  or  switched 
antiretroviral medications before week 48 were analyzed as having plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations 
≥ 400 copies/ml at week 48. 
Nevirapine,  when  substituted  for  efavirenz,  was  not  considered  as  an  addition  of  antiretroviral 
medication.

Population 
Distinction was made, in the study analysis, between patients who prematurely discontinued the study 
drugs (permanent discontinuation) (55 (18%) and 48 (15%) respectively in the tenofovir DF and d4T 
groups 18%) and those who prematurely discontinued the study as detailed in Table 16 [27(9%) and 
28(10%)]. The difference being likely that patients who discontinued the study drug but who have the 
efficacy endpoint collected were part of the efficacy analyses.

The  population  enrolled  with  a  mean  age  of  35  years  old  consisted  in  mainly  male  (74%)  patients.  
The mean viral load at baseline is of 4.91(+/- 0.62) log copies/ml, including 43 % of patients with a 
viral  load  >  100  000  copies/ml  and  39%  with  a  CD4  cell  count  at  baseline  <  200  cell/mm3  (mean 
CD4 cell count: 279+/-201). Although this patient population was treatment naïve, 19% (115/600) of 
the patients in the study had symptomatic HIV-1 infection and 18% (109/600) had AIDS (Table 16). 
The  stratification  on  the  basis  of  the  100,000  copies/ml  viral  load  (Table  15)  was  considered  as  of 
particular interest with regard to the concern raised during the initial Marketing Application in relation 
to  the  limited  number  of  patients  with  high  viral  load  (78%  of  patients  having  a  viral  load  
<5000 copies/ml).

With regard to stratification, antiviral response is similar in naïve patients regardless of baseline viral 
load, conversely to the trend observed in antiretroviral pre-treated patients.  
In ITT population, it was not possible to strictly conclude to the demonstration of the non inferiority 
since 10.4 is definitively superior to 10 (10% predefined non inferiority margin). 
However,  considering  that  this  margin  was  very  close  to  the  stringent  predefined  non  inferiority 
margin, the efficacy demonstration has been considered as acceptable. 
When the ITT analysis only considers the population with HIV RNA values at week 48 (exclusion of 
patients  who  prematurely  discontinued  the  study:  27/299  and  28/301  in  the  tenofovir  DF  and  d4T 
groups respectively), results are in accordance with the predefined hypothesis of non inferiority.  
Secondary endpoints 
Ultrasensitive test results (plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/ml at week 48) were in accordance 
with the  10% predefined  non-inferiority  margin, for  both ITT and AT  population. Moreover, in line 
with previous efficacy analyses, comparable results were observed between both treatment groups in 
term of viral load change from baseline (- 3 log copies/ml).

Clinical Safety 
At  the  time  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  evaluation,  the  safety  database  comprised  mainly  data 
from the three controlled clinical studies of tenofovir DF (studies 907, 902 and the extensions of these 
studies,  and  study  901)  as  well  as  data  from  the  compassionate  use  study  in  patients  with  advanced 
disease  (study  908).  These  studies  included  approximately  1,050  HIV  infected  adult  patients  who 
received tenofovir DF  either alone (study 901) or in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal

products (studies 902, 907 and 908).  The safety profile of tenofovir DF was also analysed by pooling 
safety data from studies 902 and 907. This approach was considered acceptable based on the similarity 
of study design and treatment experience of the populations. 
Experience from clinical trials  
Safety data were collected from study 910, an open-label multicenter study of the safety of tenofovir 
DF  
300 mg administered orally over an extended period to HIV-1 infected patients previously treated in 
studies  901,  902,  and  907.  Patients  who  completed  either  of  the  two  studies  without  dose-limiting 
toxicity  were  eligible  to  enroll  in  study  910.  As  of  1st  May  2001,  467  patients  from  study  907,  
102 patients from study 902 and 6 patients from study 901 have rolled over to study 910.  
Experience from Post Marketing surveillance 
Based on the long term data of studies 902 and 907, data of ongoing study 910 and 903 as well as data 
assessed in the first (31/10/01 - 30/04/02), the second (01/05/02 – 30/10/02) and the third (01/11/02 – 
30/04/03) Periodic Safety Update Reports, the Summary of Product Characteristics have been updated 
with regard to safety. 
Patient exposure 
At  the  time  of  the  marketing  authorisation,  safety  results  obtained  with  tenofovir  DF  300  mg  were 
provided for approximately 443 patients at week 24 (including 21 patients in study 902 who received 
tenofovir  DF  300  mg  after  an  initial  24  weeks  on  placebo)  and  for  75  patients  at  week  48  for  the 
double blind phases of studies 902 and 907. A limited number of patients (n = 60) received 96 weeks 
of treatment. Data from 291 HIV infected patients with advanced disease who were enrolled in study 
908  and  received  treatment  with  tenofovir  300  mg  with  a  mean  duration  of  follow-up  of  29  weeks 
were also provided.   
To answer concerns raised on the safety of tenofovir DF, especially related to the potential bone and 
renal  toxicity,  the  applicant  provided  an  Updated  Safety  Dataset  (cut-off  June  2001)  comprising  all 
patients  (n  =  687)  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  tenofovir  DF  300  mg  in  studies  902  and  907, 
including placebo crossover patients from both studies and 74 patients who initially received 75 mg or 
150 mg tenofovir DF in study 902.  The mean exposure to tenofovir DF for this updated clinical trial 
population was 58 weeks, with a range of 0.4 to 143 weeks (Table 20).

Experience from Pivotal clinical trials 
The assessment of adverse reactions from pivotal clinical trials is based on: 
-   studies  902 and  907, in  653  treatment-experienced  patients receiving treatment  with  tenofovir DF 
(n = 443)  or  placebo  (n = 210)  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral  medicinal  products  for 
24 weeks  
-  and  also  study  903,  in  which  600  treatment  naïve  patients  received  treatment  with  tenofovir  DF 
(n = 299) or stavudine (n = 301) in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz for 48 weeks.  
Experience form Post Marking surveillance 
As  of  31st  October  2002,  the  cumulative  patient  exposure  to  tenofovir  is  estimated  to  be 
100,302 patients.  
Adverse events and serious adverse event/death 
Overall, the frequency and type of adverse events reported in the tenofovir DF and the placebo groups 
appeared similar during the 24-week placebo-controlled treatment phases of both studies 902 and 907.  
The  most  frequently reported  adverse events  associated  with tenofovir DF related to  gastrointestinal 
disorders  (nausea,  diarrhoea,  vomiting  and  flatulence).  In  the  pooled  dataset,  approximately  1  %  of 
patients  discontinued tenofovir  due to occurrence  of  gastrointestinal adverse  events. In the tenofovir 
DF 300 mg group, 10 % and 12 % of patients reported diarrhoea and nausea respectively during the 
first 24 weeks of treatment. In addition asthenia, headache, vomiting and flatulence considered related 
to  treatment  were  each  reported  by  more  than  5  %  of  patients  in  the  tenofovir  DF  group.   
The frequency of gastrointestinal disorders reported in the placebo group was similar and safety data 
from study 902 did not reveal any dose effect. 
The nature, frequency and severity of adverse events during the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study 
903 were similar between the tenofovir DF group and the active control group. Frequently occurring 
adverse  events  (> 20%  of  either  treatment  group)  were  headache,  viral  infection,  diarrhoea,  nausea, 
dizziness, pharyngitis and rash.  
The  additional  reactions  identified  from  post-marketing  experience  are  increased  creatinine,  renal 
insufficiency,  kidney  failure,  Fanconi  syndrome,  proximal  tubulopathy,  proteinuria,  acute  renal 
failure,  asthenia,  dyspnoea,  rash,  pancreatitis,  lactic  acidosis,  abdominal  pain,  allergic  reaction  and 
amylase increased.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In  all  the  clinical  studies,  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  occurred  infrequently  and  there  was  no 
difference  between  the  tenofovir  DF  and  placebo  groups.  SAEs  that  were  considered  related  to 
tenofovir DF were uncommon.  During the double-blind period of the phase II/III studies, only four 
tenofovir  DF;  hepatic  failure  
least  possibly  related 
SAEs  were  considered 
(tenofovir DF 75 mg), osteopenia (tenofovir DF 75 mg), acute pancreatitis (tenofovir DF 300 mg) and 
lactic acidosis associated with nausea (tenofovir DF 300 mg).

In treatment-experienced patients (studies 902 and 907), the frequency of serious adverse events was 
higher  in  placebo  patients  (8%)  compared  to  patients  who  received  tenofovir  DF  (5%)  during  24-
weeks  of  treatment.  While  the  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  has  increased  with  extended 
treatment  duration  in  these  studies  (mean  duration  of  93  weeks),  individual  events  have  occurred 
infrequently, with only pneumonia (3%) occurring in > 1% of patients. 
In Study 903, 11% of patients in the tenofovir group and 10% of patients in the active control group 
experienced serious adverse events.  In the tenofovir DF group, possibly related serious adverse events  
(as judged by the investigator) comprised single reports of anaemia, peripheral neuritis, bronchitis and 
gynecomastia.  Two  patients  in  the  tenofovir  DF  group  experienced  acute  kidney  failure,  although 
neither of these events was considered related to treatment.   
A  total  of  3  deaths  were  reported  in  studies  901,  902  and  907,  and  one  subsequent  death  occurred 
during  the  extension  protocol  910,  although  none  of  them  was  considered  related  to  tenofovir.  
In study 903, 5 patients (1 in the tenofovir DF group and 4 in the active control group) died during the 
first 48-week phase of  the study.   All 5 deaths were  considered as not  related to either  stavudine or 
tenofovir DF. 
Post-approval,  during  the  reporting  periods  for  the  first  and  second  PSURs  (26  October  2001  to  
31  October  2002),  a  total  of  28  reports  with  a  fatal  outcome  were  received  in  the  PSURs.   
Twenty-four of these were considered possibly related to treatment. In these 24 reports, other factors 
were present, such as concurrent illnesses or concomitant medication, which could have contributed to 
the reported events.  
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory  abnormalities  of  all  grades  generally  occurred  with  similar  frequencies  in  the  tenofovir  
300  mg  and  placebo  groups  in  study  907  (96  %  versus  97  %  respectively).  Although  preclinical 
studies  identified  small  transient  changes  in  liver  enzymes  in  rats,  a  combined  analysis  of  studies  
902  and  907  (n  =  443)  did  not  reveal  any  significant  difference  between  tenofovir  DF  300  mg  and 
placebo  in  the  incidence  of  graded  ALT  elevation  during  24  weeks  of  double  blind  treatment.  
An analysis of risk factors for elevated ALT (≥ 2 grade) showed that patients with underlying hepatitis 
had a 2.7 fold greater risk of ALT elevations (p < 0.0001). The applicant will further address whether 
the introduction of tenofovir in co-infected patients has any influence in the evolution of HBV/HCV 
infections. 
During  the  preclinical  studies,  administration  of  tenofovir  DF  resulted  in  bone  abnormalities  and 
kidney  alterations.  The  potential  bone  toxicity  and  nephrotoxicity  of  tenofovir  DF  were  therefore 
assessed during the clinical studies and a more specific assessment of some laboratory parameters was 
performed. 
No significant laboratory toxicity related to treatment with tenofovir DF in both treatment-experienced 
and treatment-naïve patients were observed. Studies 902, 907 and 903 did not show a significant renal 
toxicity.  In  long-term  data,  an  increased  incidence  of  hypophosphatemia  grade  1  and  2  of  18%  was 
observed  after  a  median  duration  of  exposure  of  93  weeks.  The  increased  incidence  of 
hypophosphatemia  in  study  902  and  907  was  not  confirmed  in  study  903.  Hypophosphatemia  was 
transient,  resolving  while  patients  continued  to  receive  tenofovir  DF  or  after  discontinuation  of  the 
medicinal product. 
Events of Special Interest 
Bone abnormalities 
An analysis of bone-related laboratory parameters (urinary and serum calcium, parathyroid hormone 
and alkaline phosphatase) did not suggest pathology associated with tenofovir administration. In study 
907, there was no clinically significant difference in the fractional excretion of phosphate for tenofovir 
compared  to  placebo  (mean  +0.37  %  versus  -1.12  %  respectively;  median:  +0.40  %  versus  
-1.00 %). 
36/43 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A  combined  incidence  of  grade  1  and  2  hypophosphataemia  of  12  %  for  tenofovir  DF  and  7  %  for 
placebo was reported during the double blind treatment period of studies 902 and 907. The treatment 
difference was not statistically significant. The Safety Updated Dataset showed that the incidence of 
grade  1  and  2  abnormalities  increased  slightly  to  15  %.  The  hypophosphataemia  was  transient.  
Among the pooled population of tenofovir DF treated patients, 17 received phosphate supplements at 
some timepoints. All of them had their abnormality resolved. The mechanism of hypophosphataemia 
has not yet been elucidated and its impact on the bone is unknown. It was, however, suggested that it 
was more likely to be related to an effect on intestinal phosphate absorption than renal toxicity. Indeed 
the  absence  of  link  between  hypophosphataemia  and  proximal  tubule  impairment  was  comforted  by 
the  absence  of  other  abnormalities usually  observed  in  tubulopathy  (hypokalemia,  decreased  plasma 
bicarbonate  glycosuria).  It  was  agreed  to  recommend  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics 
monitoring  of  serum  phosphate  and  the  applicant  agreed  to  further  evaluate  the  potential  benefit  of 
administering phosphate supplements in patients who develop hypophosphataemia.  
Bone  mineral  density  monitoring  was  performed  in  a  subgroup  of  patients  from  study  902  
(n = 62, including 11 in the placebo group). The median percentage of changes from baseline at week 
24 were -2.00 % for the placebo group versus - 0.16 %, - 0.15 % and –1.19 % for tenofovir DF 75 mg, 
150 mg  and  300  mg  respectively.  These  changes  were  mild  and  not  statistically  significant.  
The effects did not worsen with continued exposure to tenofovir DF up to week 48 and no dose effect 
relationship could be evidenced.  
In the Safety Updated Dataset, a total of 27 fractures were reported in patients treated with tenofovir. 
In the controlled studies there have been no reports of vertical compression fractures or spontaneous 
fractures of weight bearing bones, and all the fractures have been associated with significant trauma. 
Experience from Post Marketing surveillance 
The available data are too limited to draw conclusions concerning bone toxicity. However, reduction 
in  bone  mineral  density  was  seen  in  patients  after  48  weeks  of  treatment  with  tenofovir  DF. 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  has  been  requested  to  continue  the  monitoring  of  potential 
adverse effects / toxicity on bone metabolism as part of post-marketing specific obligations (including 
the collection of bone densitometric measurements, bone markers, cases of fracture and osteoporosis) 
from PSURs and from the ongoing clinical study in antiretroviral naïve patients. 
Renal toxicity 
In the short term studies 901 and 701, no acute renal toxicity associated with tenofovir was reported. 
The  protocols  of  studies  902  and  907  excluded  patients  with  renal  impairment  (plasma  creatinine  
>  1.5  mg/ml  and/or  creatinine  clearance  <  60  ml/min)  and  those  who  received  concomitant 
nephrotoxic substances. 
A  combined  incidence  of  increased  serum  creatinine  of  grade  1  of  1  %  was  reported  for  tenofovir  
DF  compared  to  placebo  during  the  double-blind  period  of  studies  902  and  907.  Nearly  all  of  these 
Grade 1 abnormalities remained in the normal range (< 1.5 mg/dl).  No patient discontinued treatment 
due  to  an  increase  in  serum  creatinine.  The  Safety  Updated  Dataset  confirmed  that  the  incidence  of 
increased  creatinine  was  low  (5  %)  and  no  patient  had  a  serum  creatinine  elevation  above  grade  1.  
In study 903, the incidence of increased serum creatinine was similar between the tenofovir DF group 
(1.7%) and the active control group (2.3%) and the incidence of hypophosphataemia was also similar 
between the two groups (tenofovir DF group (5.0%) and the active control group (4.0%).   
The incidence of decrease in bicarbonate hypokalemia, glycosuria and proteinuria was similar between 
tenofovir DF and placebo groups. These data suggest that tenofovir DF is not nephrotoxic although the 
risk  cannot  be  currently  completely  excluded.  Therefore  monitoring  of  the  renal  function,  
is  recommended  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics.  The  use  of  tenofovir  DF  should  be 
avoided  with  concurrent  or  recent  use  of  a  nephrotoxic  medicinal  product;  if  concomitant  use  of 
tenofovir  DF  and  nephrotoxic  agents  is  unavoidable,  weekly  monitoring  of  renal  function  is 
recommended.  Finally  in  patients  with  an  increase  of  creatinine  to  values  higher  than  2  mg/dl  or 
decrease in serum phosphate to values below 1 mg/dl, interrupting tenofovir DF treatment should be 
considered.

(including  Fanconi), 
As described in the PSURs, cases of renal events have been identified in the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder Global Safety Database (which includes serious adverse events from clinical trials and serious 
and  non-serious  adverse  events  reported  from  spontaneous  sources  or  literature  publications). 
 Reported  cases  with  renal  impairment  were  difficult  to  assess,  however  tenofovir  DF  can  be

responsible 
Moreover,  glycosuria,  hypophosphatemia  and  proteinuria  are  sensitive  indexes  of  proximal 
tubulopathies  and  are  often  observed  in  proximal  tubulopathies  cases.  Most  abnormalities  were 
reversible after discontinuation of tenofovir DF. 
Even  though  background  noise  concerning  renal  events  in  HIV  patients  is  high,  longterm  data  on 
efficacy and tolerability have  been requested in patients whose renal function necessitates a reduced 
tenofovir DF dosage as well as a safety review of all renal disorders. 
Based on post-marketing experience and ongoing review of the total Safety database for Viread, the 
following renal events have been added to the Summary of Product Characteristics as possible adverse 
reactions  on  the  basis  of  seriousness,  frequency  and  potential  causal  relationship  with  tenofovir  DF:

Mitochondrial toxicity 
Although in vitro tenofovir did not have any effect on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA nor on the 
production  of  lactic  acidosis,  adverse  events  compatible  with  mitochondrial  toxicity  were  reported 
with tenofovir DF. For instance, 3 cases of pancreatitis were reported, 2 in study 907 and one in study 
908.  In  these  3  cases,  tenofovir  was  added  to  nucleoside  analogues  regimen.  As  already  mentioned, 
during the double-blind period of the phase II/III studies, there were 3 SAEs related to tenofovir DF 
which could be considered secondary to mitochondrial toxicity; hepatic failure (tenofovir DF 75 mg), 
acute  pancreatitis  (tenofovir  DF  300  mg)  and  lactic  acidosis  associated  with  nausea  (tenofovir  
DF 300  mg). The safety data from clinical trials suggested that tenofovir DF has a low potential for 
mitochondrial  toxicity,  and  data  from  the  treatment-naïve  population  (study  903)  were  similarly 
reassuring with little evidence of tenofovir DF-related mitochondrial toxicities.   
The  assessment  of  clinical  safety  data  from  ongoing  clinical  studies  and  during  post-marketing 
experience  continues  to  demonstrate  a  low  risk  of  mitochondrial  toxicity  with  tenofovir  DF. 
Lactic acidosis and pancreatitis were identified as possible adverse reactions and were included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.  
Lactic acidosis 
Evidence  from  adequate  and  well-controlled  clinical  studies  in  both  treatment-experienced  and 
treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients have demonstrated a low risk of lactic acidosis with tenofovir 
DF.  Following  the  review  of  the  first  (26.10.01-30.04.02)  and  second  (01.05.02-31.10.02)  PSURs, 
lactic acidosis was identified as a possible adverse reaction on the basis of seriousness, frequency of 
reporting or potential causal relationship with tenofovir DF of cases in the Clinical Safety Database.  
Since patients involved in these cases had been diagnosed with HIV for many years and in most cases 
antiretroviral  combination  regimens  included  medications  implicated  in  the  development  of  lactic 
acidosis  (such  as  didanosine,  stavudine),  these  events  could  have  been  complications  of  long-term 
antiretroviral  NRTI  therapy  and  therefore,  the  potential  contribution  of  tenofovir  DF  is  difficult  to 
assess.  The  same  conclusions  were  given  further  to  the  review  of  the  third  PSUR  (01/11/02  – 
30/04/03).  Overall,  the  assessment  of  clinical  safety  data  from  ongoing  MAH  sponsored  clinical 
studies  and  during  post-marketing  experience,  continues  to  demonstrate  a  low  risk  of  lactic  acidosis 
with  tenofovir  DF.  However,  considered  against  the  background  of  NRTI-associated  lactic  acidosis 
and the revised class labelling, the CPMP has decided to strengthen the warning section of the product 
information  of  Viread  with  regard  to  lactic  acidosis.  Furthermore,  the  SPC  has  been  updated  to 
highlight that the risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis, a class effect of nucleoside analogues, is low for 
tenofovir DF as indicated by preclinical and clinical data.

Long term safety profile 
In  the  extended  phase  of  study  902  (median  time  on  study  medication  of  approximately  90  weeks), 
tenofovir  DF  continues  to  be  well  tolerated:  19%  patients  have  discontinued  study.  The  two  most 
common  ≥  grade  3  adverse  events  were  asthenia  and  depression;  the  three  most  common 
 ≥  grade  3  laboratory  abnormalities  were  elevations  of  AST,  triglycerides  and  creatine  kinase.  
No patient developed ≥ grade 2 elevation in serum creatinine. One death occurred due to liver failure, 
which  was  not  considered  related  to  tenofovir  DF.  The  results  should  however  be  considered  with 
caution  as  the  number  of  patients  exposed  were  limited.  The  Updated  Safety  Dataset  (including  
687  patients  who  received  tenofovir  DF  at  the  dose  of  300  mg  daily  for  a  mean  of  58  weeks) 
substantiated the absence of potential nephrotoxicity and bone toxicity related to the use of tenofovir. 
Continuous  assessment  of  Viread  long-term  safety  profile  is  performed  throughout  PSURs  and  the 
product information updated accordingly. 
Safety profile of Viread in combination therapy 
Treatment  with  a  combination  of  at  least  three  antiretroviral  drugs  can  induce  a  characteristic 
syndrome  termed  lipodystrophy  or  fat  redistribution  syndrome  containing  peripheral  fat  wasting 
(including  accentuation  of  facial  folds)  and  central  adiposity.  Metabolic  disturbances  such  as 
hyperlipidaemia and insulin resistance also often appear. PIs were originally believed to be the causal 
agents.  NRTIs  have  also  been  implicated.  In  addition,  lipodystrophy  has  also  been  observed  with 
protease-inhibitor-sparing  regimens.  The  emerging  picture  is  that  of  a  connection  between  visceral 
lipomatosis  and  protease  inhibitors  and  lipoatrophy  and  NRTIs  correlating  with  different  possible 
mechanisms e.g. effects on lipoprotein production and adipocyte differentiation. Non-drug factors are 
also of importance e.g. increasing age, duration and severity of HIV infection. 
Following  evaluation  of  data  submitted  by  all  MAHs  of  antiretroviral  medicinal  products,  a  class 
labelling,  which  harmonises  the  information  on  lipodystrophy  for  all  three  classes  of  antiretroviral 
products, has been agreed and implemented in the product information for all antiretroviral medicinal 
products. The wording presents as much as possible of the presently available knowledge; it gives a 
description  of  the  condition  (although  there  is  at  present  no  clear  definition  of  lipodystrophy), 
information  about  causality  and  surveillance  measures.  The  higher  risk  of  developing  lipodystrophy 
with  long-term  therapy  as  well  as  importance  of  factors  such  as  age  and  disease  related  factors  is 
mentioned.  
Liver impairment in HIV positive patients  
Further  to  the  discussions  held  by  the  Ad-hoc  Group  of  Experts  on  Anti-HIV  medicinal  products  in 
November  2001, the CPMP  agreed that liver impairment  was of  increasing concern in  HIV positive 
patients  both  in  the  form  of  adverse  hepatic  effects  in  patients  with  normal  liver  function  prior  to 
antiretroviral treatment (ART) and as regards patients with chronic liver disease treated with ART.  
In January 2002 the CPMP requested the MAH for all authorised anti-retroviral medicinal products to 
conduct  a  retrospective  review  of  clinical  trials  and  post  marketing  data  relating  to  the  use  of  their 
product(s)  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  and/or  HBV/HCV  co-infection.  Following  review  of 
the  submitted  responses  and  discussions  held  during  the  CPMP  meeting  and  the  Pharmacovigilance 
Working  Party  meeting  in  October  2002,  the  CPMP  adopted  a  list  of  questions  (including  general, 
product specific and SPC wording recommendations). 
The  review  of  the  MAHs’  responses  has  essentially confirmed  that  co-infected  patients  and  patients 
with  underlying  liver  disorders  are  at  increased  risk  for  adverse  events,  essentially  confined  to  liver 
events.  Overall,  there  is  a  disturbing  lack  of  general  and  product  specific  knowledge  (e.g.  relevant 
pharmacokinetic data in patients with liver impairment), but there are ongoing activities.   
For  some  of  the  products  still  undergoing  drug  development,  the  MAHs  have  confirmed  that  co-
infected  patients  will  not  be  excluded  from  participation  in  the  studies.  The  CPMP  stressed  that 
whenever  feasible  a  minimum  number  of  co-infected  patients  should  be  included  in  forthcoming 
studies in order to provide a reasonable basis for a relevant safety (and efficacy) analysis.

Following the review of responses submitted by all MAHs of antiretroviral medicinal products, a class 
labelling  on  “liver  disease”  has  been  agreed  and  implemented  in  the  product  information  for  all 
antiretroviral medicinal products. 
The SPC of Viread has been reworded in accordance with the CPMP recommendations to include, in 
section 5.2, data on AUC, Cmax and Cmin (including CV) derived from patients. These PK results in 
patients  give  a  more  reliable  description  of  the  concentrations  achieved  in  clinical  practice  at  the 
recommended dose. 
Future studies with regard to liver disease 
The MAH plans to evaluate safety of Viread in patients with liver disease or hepatitis B/C co-infection 
with  two  ongoing  studies  (subset  safety  analysis  of  data  from  the  “French  ATU  de  cohorte”,  which 
ended in December 2001 and study ACTG 5127). The MAH has committed to continue to not exclude 
co- infected patients from participation in clinical trials. 
In  addition,  with  respect  to  the  request  for  follow-up  as  regards  liver  disorders  and  ART  through 
cohort  studies,  the  CPMP  noted  that  the  HAART  oversight  committee  is  active  and  will  provide 
proposals for agreement. 
Compassionate use 
In  this  population  with  advanced  disease,  89  cases  of  grade  3  or  4  adverse  events  were  reported.  
There were 13 cases (4%) of pneumonia (community acquired Pneumonia, Pneumocystis carinii) all 
grade  3-4,  among  those  5  were  fatal.  None  of  these  cases  were  considered  related  to  tenofovir  DF.  
A  total  of  15  deaths  were  reported  that  were  considered  probably  related  to  disease  progression. 
Safety in specific populations 
The safety profile of tenofovir DF in children is currently unknown as well as in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
5.   Overall Conclusion and benefit risk assessment 
Quality 
In  general  the  quality  dossier  has  been  well  presented  and  indicates  that  the  active  substance  and 
product are manufactured and controlled in a relevant way in compliance with current EU guidelines.  
Satisfactory information has been provided to show that these manufacture and control processes are 
under  control  and  routinely  and  consistently  generate  a  product  of  uniform  quality  likely  to  have  a 
reproducible performance in the clinic.  However, at the time of the opinion, the CPMP found that a 
number quality issues were still unresolved.  These issues were considered to have no impact on the 
benefit/risk balance  of the product when used  according to the  Summary  of Product Characteristics.   
It was agreed that they should be resolved as follow up measures to be submitted post-authorisation. 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Tenofovir  DF  presented  an  antiviral  activity  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo,  compatible  with  a  potential 
clinical use for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
Based  on  in  vitro  data,  the  mitochondrial  toxicity  appears  not  to  be  a  major  concern  compared  to 
nucleoside  analogues.  These  preliminary  findings  will  however  be  further  substantiated  through 
fulfilled  post-authorisation.

The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  tenofovir  has  been  adequately  characterised  in  the  different  species 
studied.  Following  oral  administration,  tenofovir  DF  is  rapidly  absorbed  and  converted  to  tenofovir. 
Tenofovir is  mainly excreted  renally. Tenofovir is not  metabolised through  CYP450 system  and did

not  have  any  potential  effect  on  major  CYP  isoforms  except  for  inducing  CYP1A1  and  2B. 
The toxicological profile tenofovir DF was assessed using a complete battery of toxicological studies. 
Identified  target  organs  were  gastro-intestinal  tract,  bone  and  kidney.  The  toxic  effects  occurred  at 
exposure  levels  comparable  or  slightly  higher  than  that  measured  in  humans  with  300  mg  dose  of 
tenofovir  DF.  Safety  margins  ranged  therefore  between  2  and  10  according  to  species.  Although 
toxicity in some target organs has a very low safety margin, this has to be put in balance with clinical 
experience  derived  from  the  clinical  studies.  A  concern  was  raised  however  with  respect  to  the 
potential  nephrotoxicity  and  bone  toxicity  of  tenofovir  DF.  Although  the  currently  available  data, 
including  safety  data,  do  not  evidence  that  tenofovir  DF  is  nephrotoxic  and  bone  toxic,  appropriate 
recommendations  have  been  included  in  the  product  information  and  the  Marketing  Authorisation 
Holder  has  been  requested  to  closely  monitor  cases  of  renal  disorders,  bone  disorders  and 
osteoporosis. 
Reproduction toxicity studies indicated that tenofovir DF did not affect fertility parameters and is not 
embryotoxic nor teratogenic although it reduced the viability index and weight of pups in peri and post 
natal studies.  
Tenofovir was genotoxic in some tests therefore potentially carcinogenic. However, given the results 
from  the  long-term  oral  carcinogenicity  study  in  mice  and  rats,  it  was  considered  that  there  are  no 
significant concerns regarding the carcinogenic potential of tenofovir DF in patients. 
Other outstanding preclinical issues were identified, but the CPMP considered that they did not have 
any impact on the benefit/risk balance of the product when used according to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics.    It  was  agreed  that  they  should  be  resolved  as  follow  up  measures  to  be  submitted 
post-authorisation. 
Efficacy 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  tenofovir  DF  was  adequately  defined,  mainly  in  male  HIV  infected 
patients. Tenofovir DF was rapidly absorbed, converted into tenofovir and mainly eliminated renally 
as  unchanged.  Food  enhanced  the  low  bioavailability  of  tenofovir  DF,  and  therefore  it  is 
recommended to take tenofovir DF with food. Of interest, the metabolism of the tenofovir DF did not 
interfere  with  the  CYP  3A4,  which  limits  the  potential  for  pharmacokinetic  interactions.  
An unexpected interaction with lopinavir/ritonavir has however been observed. Some remaining issues 
with respect to potential interactions with other medicinal products were identified that the applicant 
agreed  to  clarify  as  part  of  follow-up  measures  to  be  fulfilled  post-authorisation.  In  addition,  
the applicant has provided additional data to characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of tenofovir DF, 
particularly with respect to patients with renal impairment and the potential impact of gender and/or 
race.  No  pharmacokinetic  data  in  children  are  currently  available  but  the  Marketing  Authorisation 
Holder has undertaken to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile in this population. 
 Tenofovir  exhibits  a  long  half-life,  over  12  hours,  with  an  intracellular  T1/2  >24  hours  in  PBMC, 
allowing  once  daily  dosing,  which  presents  an  advantage  for  adherence.  The  choice  of  the  dose,  
one  tablet  of  245  mg  tenofovir  disoproxil  once  daily,  has  been  appropriately  substantiated  during 
clinical  trials.  The  one  daily  dosage  regiment  was  considered  of  interest  in  terms  of  compliance. 
The  clinical  benefit  of  tenofovir  containing  regimen  in  term  of  virological  suppression  was  mainly 
based,  at  the  time  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation,  on  two  placebo-controlled  studies  performed  in 
antiretroviral multi-experienced patients with extensive resistance mutations at baseline and designed 
as intensification trials (902 and 907). This intensification design corresponds to a pragmatic approach 
in  the  management  of  early  treatment  failure.  Although,  this  compound  was  developed  before  the 
revision  of  the  Points  to  Consider  Document  in  the  assessment  of  anti-HIV  medicinal  product,  the 
development is in line with the spirit of the guideline.  
The  majority  of  patients  experienced  an  early  virological  failure  (<  10,  000  copies/ml  with  the 
majority  of  patients  having  <  5,000  copies/ml)  and  received  tenofovir  DF  in  addition  to  a  triple 
regimen. At week 24, in the ITT population, a limited but clinically relevant decrease in viral load was 
observed in comparison with placebo (-0.6 log10 copies/ml), and was consistent in both 902 and 907 
studies. This effect appeared to be sustained at 48 weeks, based on the limited data from study 902 and 
the durability of the virological response in this population was confirmed by the 48-week final data 
41/43 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
  
from study 907, submitted as part as post-marketing specific obligation. Clarifications provided by the 
applicant  gave  reassurance  on  minimal  impact  of  the  change  in  antiretroviral  therapy  during  the 
studies  on  the  overall  efficacy  results.  Subanalyses  (immunological  and  virological  parameters  at 
baseline)  were  performed  but  the  results  were  not  sufficiently  robust  to  draw  any  firm  conclusions. 
A concern was raised however on the limited clinical data in patients with high viral load at baseline, 
but  the  applicant  undertook  to  further  evaluate  the  clinical  benefit  of  tenofovir  DF  in  this 
subpopulation as part of specific obligations to be fulfilled post-authorisation. 
In  addition,  a  study  conducted  in  antiretroviral  naïve  patients  was  submitted  post-authorisation.  
This trial investigated the antiviral effect of Viread used in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz 
versus  stavudine,  lamivudine and  efavirenz, in  treatment-naïve  patients with a  significant proportion 
of  patients  with  a  plasma  viral  load  >  100  000  copies/ml  (stratification)  at  baseline  (43%).  
In these treatment-naïve patients, comparable results were observed between both treatment groups in 
term of viral load change from baseline. Based on the 48-week data of this study, the indication has 
been extended to antiretroviral naïve patients. The 144-weeks data of this ongoing study are awaited to 
further assess the durability of the virological response. 
The  favourable  resistance  profile  has  been  further  substantiated  through  a  significant  amount  of 
genotypic  and  phenotypic  data  derived  from  clinical  studies.  Overall  a  low  level  of  resistance  to 
tenofovir  DF  has  been  demonstrated  in  vitro  and  the  NRTI  genotypic  resistance  at  baseline  did  not 
influence  the  virological  response  to  tenofovir.  The  resistance  profile  was  therefore  considered  of 
interest in antiretroviral experienced patients.  
Of particular interest, the emergence of resistance is limited (3% at 48 weeks in pretreated patients). 
Based on the data derived from clinical studies, the introduction of tenofovir should be discouraged in 
patients  with  strains  harbouring,  at  baseline,  the  K65R  mutation,  which  is  the  primary  mutation 
associated  with  tenofovir,  as  observed  with  abacavir.  However,  the  clinical  breakpoints  of  tenofovir 
have not been determined. The Marketing Authorisation Holder is investigating this issue as well as 
the appropriate guidance that should be provided when K65R is emerging during the time course of 
treatment with tenofovir.  
The  resistance  profile  of  the  drug  is  described  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and 
additional  data  are  expected  post-authorisation  to  further  characterise  the  resistance  profile  of 
tenofovir DF and the clinical relevance. 
The  clinical  benefit  in  children  and  adolescents  under  18  years  of  age  is  currently  unknown  but  the 
applicant  presented  a  paediatric  programme,  for  which  the  results  of  the  studies  will  be  submitted 
post-authorisation.  
Other  clinical  outstanding  issues  were  identified  and  will  be  resolved  as  follow  up  measures  to  be 
submitted post-authorisation. 
Safety 
Overall the tolerance of tenofovir DF was good and the post-marketing safety data did not raise any 
new  concern.  The  undesirable  effects  reported  with  tenofovir  DF  were  mainly  gastro-intestinal 
disorders,  dizziness,  and  hypophosphatemia.  During  post-approval  use  of  tenofovir  DF,  possible 
adverse reactions have also been identified, such as: asthenia, pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, dyspnoea, 
rash and renal disorders. 
The safety profile of the tenofovir DF raised some concerns with respect to nephrotoxicity and bone 
toxicity.  Hypophosphataemia  was  observed  in  preclinical  and  in  clinical  studies  902  and  907.  
The mechanism is currently unknown but it was suggested that hypophosphataemia is most likely to 
be  related  to  an  effect  on  intestinal  phosphate  absorption  than  tubular  toxicity.  The  benefit  of  a 
phosphorus supplementation will be further investigated in patients experiencing hypophosphataemia 
in  clinical  studies.  Additional  Safety  Updated  Data  as  well  as  post-marketing  safety  data  gave  re-
assurance of the absence of nephrotoxicity and bone toxicity of tenofovir DF. However the need for 
monitoring  renal  toxicity  and  serum  phosphate  has  been  included  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics.

The  applicant  undertook  to  perform  a  close  post-marketing  surveillance  targeting  these  particular 
issues  (safety  review  of  all  renal  disorders  and  collection  of  bone  densitometric  measurements  and 
bone markers).

Based  on  the  CPMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CPMP  considered  that  the 
benefit/risk  profile  of  tenofovir  DF  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral  medicinal  products  was 
favourable  in  the  treatment  of  HIV-infected  adult  patients  experiencing  early  virological  failure. 
Results from studies which were ongoing at the time of the evaluation of the marketing authorisation 
have been provided, including study in naïve patients, to complete the assessment in terms of efficacy 
(durability of the response and impact  on CD4) and safety profile of tenofovir DF. Considering that 
other additional preclinical and clinical efficacy and safety data should be submitted to further define 
the  efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  tenofovir  DF,  the  marketing  authorisation  for  Tenofovir  
245  mg  film-coated  tablets  remains  under  exceptional  circumstances,  as  initially  recommended  
by the CPMP.  
Further to the assessment of study in naïve patients, the indications are currently: 
“Viread  is  indicated  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral  medicinal  products  for  the 
treatment of HIV-1 infected adults over 18 years of age. 
The  demonstration  of  benefit  of  Viread  is  based  on  results  of  one  study  in  treatment-naïve 
patients, including patients with a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) and studies in which 
Viread  was  added  to  stable  background  therapy  (mainly  tritherapy)  in  antiretroviral  pre-
treated patients experiencing early virological failure (< 10,000 copies/ml, with the majority 
of patients having < 5,000 copies/ml). 
In deciding on a new regimen for patients who have failed an antiretroviral regimen, careful 
consideration should be given to the patterns of mutations associated with different medicinal 
products  and  the  treatment  history  of  the  individual  patient.  Where  available,  resistance 
testing may be appropriate”. 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by majority 
decision that the benefit/risk profile of Viread was favourable, in combination with other antiretroviral 
agents, in the treatment of HIV infected patients over 18 years of age.

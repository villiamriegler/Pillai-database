Authorisation to Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is an orally inhaled fixed-dose combination product containing 
the active substances budesonide, an inhaled glucocorticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity in the 
lungs, and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, a selective long-acting inhaled β 2 adrenoceptor agonist. This 
combination of active substances is already approved at national level in several EU countries. This 
well-known combination is indicated for use in the regular treatment of adults, adolescents and children 
of 6 years and older with asthma where the use of the combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and an 
inhaled long-acting β 2 adrenoceptor agonist is appropriate (maintenance and reliever therapy). 
The fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate has been shown to provide greater 
improvement in pulmonary function and overall asthma control than either drug administered alone and 
its use does not result in any untoward interaction that might affect the pharmacokinetic, 
pharmacodynamic or safety profiles of the individual drugs.  
Budesonide is an orally inhaled glucocorticosteroid with high local anti-inflammatory activity and a lower 
incidence of adverse effects than is seen with oral corticosteroids. Budesonide has been shown to 
decrease airways reactivity to histamine and methacholine in patients with hyper reactive airways. 
Inhaled budesonide is recommended for use in the management of patients with asthma. 
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate is a selective long-acting β 2 adrenergic agonist and exerts a preferential 
effect on β 2 adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle to produce relaxation and 
bronchodilatation. Formoterol is used via the orally inhaled route in the management of patients with 
reversible airways obstruction. Formoterol produces bronchodilatation within 1-3 minutes following 
inhalation, bronchodilatation which lasts for 12 hours following a single dose. Formoterol is particularly 
useful in patients with reversible airways obstruction who continue to experience symptoms despite 
treatment with an anti-inflammatory agent such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Guidelines for the 
management of reversible airways obstruction and particularly asthma recommend the addition of a 
long-acting β 2 agonist to the treatment regimen in these patients and studies have shown that the 
addition of a long-acting β 2 agonist provides better control of asthma than increasing the dose of inhaled 
corticosteroid. 
The mechanisms of action of the two drugs, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate are different 
but complementary. Budesonide and formoterol fumarate demonstrate additive effects. 
The clinical pharmacology of budesonide and formoterol fumarate has been investigated extensively in 
the past, is well known and has been the subject of many publications. The applicant has not presented 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/707217/2014 
Page 11/65 
 
 
 
 
a review of the literature with regard to the pharmacokinetics (and pharmacodynamics) of budesonide 
and formoterol fumarate but cites relevant literature as required and as appropriate. 
The applicant has submitted an application through the Centralised Procedure for an orally inhaled 
fixed-dose combination product in two strengths formulated as an inhalation powder and administered 
via a novel inhalation-driven, multi-dose dry powder inhaler (DPI) device known as the Spiromax Inhaler: 
•  Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 160/4.5 µg per dose, inhalation powder and 
•  Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 320/9 µg per dose, inhalation powder 
The proposed indication is in the regular treatment of adults with asthma where the use of the 
combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and an inhaled long-acting β 2 adrenoceptor agonist is 
appropriate. Budesonide and formoterol are well-known active substances and a fixed dose combination 
of budesonide and formoterol has well-documented and demonstrated positive benefit-risk in the claimed 
indication.  
This application has been submitted in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC Article 10(3) – hybrid 
application – application for a medicinal product referring to a so-called reference medicinal product with 
a Marketing Authorisation in a Member State or in the Community on the basis of a complete dossier in 
accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 2001/83/EC and which is or has been authorised 
in accordance with Community provisions in force for not less than 6/10 years in the EEA. 
The reference medicinal products, in respect of the combination of these two active substances, are:  
•  Symbicort Turbuhaler, 160 mikrogram/4,5 mikrogram/inhalation, inhalationspulver and 
•  Symbicort forte Turbuhaler, 320 mikrogram/9 mikrogram/inhalation, inhalationspulver  
The Marketing Authorisation Holder is AstraZeneca AB. The lower strength of these previous two 
strengths was authorised on 25th August 2000 and the highest strength was authorised on 28 December 
2001. 
The development of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. follows the CHMP Guideline on OIPs 
(CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) and aims to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of this new product to the 
reference product. The development is based on the demonstration of pharmacokinetic equivalence 
between each strength of this fixed-dose combination, BF Spiromax1 and the corresponding strength of 
the reference product, Symbicort Turbohaler. One pharmacodynamic study and one safety study have 
been carried out, but no Phase 3 clinical efficacy or safety studies have been conducted comparing the 
test and reference products in adults or adolescents. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is a fixed-dose combination product presented as dry powder 
for oral inhalation containing budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. Two strengths are 
proposed: budesonide 160 µg and formoterol (as fumarate dihydrate) 4.5 µg (middle strength) and 
budesonide 320 µg and formoterol (as fumarate dihydrate) 9 µg (high strength). The only other 
ingredient is lactose monohydrate. The product is administered via a novel inhalation-driven multi-dose 
1 BF Spiromax – The applicant refers to this fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate as BF Spiromax. 
The CHMP uses the same term in order to avoid confusion across documents.

dry powder inhaler (DPI) with active dose metering known as the Spiromax inhaler. Each inhaler contains 
either 60 doses (high strength) or 120 doses (middle strength) and is foil-wrapped. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The finished product contains two known active substances, formoterol fumarate dihydrate (a long-acting 
β 2 agonist), and budesonide (a corticosteroid anti-inflammatory), which are described in Ph. Eur. As there 
are monographs for budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the 
manufacturers of the active substances have been granted Certificates of Suitability of the European 
Pharmacopoeia (CEP) which have been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
The information provided regarding the manufacturing processes and the control of the active substances 
was assessed and approved by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines. Satisfactory quality 
of the active substances is ensured through the CEPs. Budesonide is supplied by a single manufacturer 
and formoterol fumarate dihydrate is supplied by a further manufacturer. Both active substances are 
micronized by a separate manufacturer before formulation. 
Budesonide 
Budesonide is a corticosteroid designated chemically as a mixture of the C*-22S (epimer A) and the 
C*-22R (epimer B) epimers of 16α,17-[(1RS)-butylidenebis(oxy)]-11β,21-dihydroxypregna-1,4- 
diene-3,20-dione. The active ingredient budesonide has nine chiral centres. Budesonide is a white to 
almost white crystalline powder that is practically insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in ethanol, and 
freely soluble in dichloromethane.

The release specifications include tests for residual solvents and particle size distribution in addition to all 
controls specified in the Ph. Eur. monograph. The specifications comprise tests for appearance (Ph. Eur.), 
solubility (Ph. Eur.), identification (Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), epimer A (Ph. Eur.), loss on 
drying (Ph. Eur.), assay (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (CEP) and particle size (laser diffraction). The 
method used for quantification of methanol is described in Annex I of the CEP and no validation data is 
presented since it was already assessed by EDQM. The laser diffraction method has been adequately 
described and validated. The particle size distribution is crucial to achieving the required delivered dose 
and lung deposition characteristics. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities and the in-process controls are considered 
adequate. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and 
reagents have been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. Analytical data 
demonstrating compliance with the drug substance specification have been provided for 3 batches of 
budesonide.

Budesonide is packaged in a double layer of polyethylene bags, then stored in either fibre drums or 
Moplen containers.  
Stability data on 10 pilot and commercial scale batches of budesonide from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
60% RH) and on 7 pilot and commercial scale batches stored for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters 
were tested: appearance, identity, loss on drying, assay, purity, related substances, epimer A content 
and microbial quality. The analytical methods used were the same as for release, except for 
microbiological testing and particle size. Both methods have been validated. No trends were observed 
and all results comply with the current specifications. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. The 
applicant commits to placing 1 batch of budesonide on long-term stability on an annual basis as per ICH 
guidelines. 
Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate 
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate is 2:1 salt of formoterol and fumaric acid associated with 2 molecules of 
water. It is a selective and long-acting β 2 adrenergic receptor agonist and has 2 chiral centres. It’s 
chemical name is N-[2-Hydroxy-5-[(1RS)-1-hydroxy-2-[[(1RS)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1- 
methylethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]formamide (E)-butenedioate dihydrate. Formoterol fumarate dihydrate 
is a white to almost white or slightly yellow crystalline powder that is slightly soluble in water, soluble in 
methanol, slightly soluble in 2-propanol and practically insoluble in acetonitrile. 
Figure 2.  The chemical structure of formoterol fumarate dihydrate  
The release specifications include tests for residual solvents (methanol and 2-propanol) and particle size 
distribution in addition to all controls specified in the Ph. Eur. monograph. The specifications comprise 
tests for appearance (Ph. Eur.), identification (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), related 
substances (Ph. Eur.), impurity I (Ph. Eur.), water (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (CEP) and particle size 
(laser diffraction). The method used for quantification of methanol and 2-propanol is described in the CEP 
and no validation data is presented since it was already assessed by EDQM. The laser diffraction method 
has been adequately described and validated. The particle size distribution is crucial to achieving the 
required delivered dose and lung deposition characteristics. 
The characterisation of formoterol fumarate dihydrate and its impurities and the in-process controls are 
considered adequate. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting

materials and reagents have been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Analytical data demonstrating compliance with the drug substance specification have been provided for 3 
batches of formoterol fumarate dihydrate. 
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate is packaged in an amber borosilicate glass bottle inside a thermally 
welded polyester/aluminium/polyester/polypropylene (PAPP) bag. 
Stability data on 3 production scale batches of formoterol fumarate dihydrate from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 60 months and a further 3 
production scale batches for up to 40 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and on 6 
production scale batches stored for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters were tested: appearance, 
identity, water, assay, related substances, impurity I, particle size, degree of crystallinity and microbial 
quality. The analytical methods used were the same as for release, except for microbiological testing and 
degree of crystallinity. Both methods have been validated. No trends were observed and all results 
comply with the current specifications. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. The 
applicant commits to placing 1 batch of formoterol fumarate dihydrate on long-term stability on an annual 
basis as per ICH guidelines. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The objective was to develop a dry powder for inhalation containing a fixed dose combination of 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate, a selective and long acting β2-agonist bronchodilator, and budesonide, a 
corticosteroid anti-inflammatory, to treat the symptoms of asthma. The product is to be delivered via the 
Spiromax inhaler, an inhalation-driven multi-dose dry powder delivery device. The product is designed to 
have an equivalent performance to the reference medicinal product, Symbicort Turbohaler. As such, 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. was developed following the EMA “Guideline on the 
requirements for clinical documentation for orally inhaled products including the requirements for 
demonstration of therapeutic equivalence between two inhaled products for use in the treatment of 
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults and for the use in the treatment of asthma 
in children and adolescents” (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1). Akin to the reference product, the formulation 
is a simple combination of the two active substances and lactose. 
The principles of Quality by Design were applied to the pharmaceutical development, although no design 
space was applied for and manufacture and validation are carried out classically. The applicant defined 
key parameters of the reference product (flow resistance, uniformity of delivered dose (UDD) and 
aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD). Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out to establish 
relationships between these parameters and the in vivo performance (bioequivalence) of each active 
substance. A quality target product profile (QTPP) was then defined for Budesonide/Formoterol Teva 
Pharma B.V. as follows: it should closely match the quality profile of Symbicort Turbohaler; it should 
produce equivalent lung deposition and total systemic exposure to Symbicort Turbohaler as 
demonstrated by equivalent in vivo PK performance; it should meet the quality requirements as per EMA 
Guidance “Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal Products” 
(CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr), as well as other relevant quality guidelines. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/707217/2014 
Page 15/65 
 
 
 
 
Flow resistance and dependence, UDD, and APSD were defined as critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
Critical material attributes (CMAs) are particle size distribution (PSD) including fine particle dose (FPD) of 
both active substances and lactose and critical process parameters are mixing time and speed during 
blending. The relationship between APSD and lung deposition was determined and used to guide 
development. Limits for the various CQAs and CPPs required to ensure the desired APSD were established 
using Design of Experiments methodology (DoE). In addition, critical device attributes (CDAs) were 
compared with those of the reference product to ensure equivalent performance of the inhaler. 
A series of trial formulations using micronized budesonide, micronized formoterol, and lactose of varying 
PSD were manufactured and their performance evaluated, first in vitro, and then by PK studies in vivo. 
Once the final formulation had been decided, a further pivotal in vivo PK study was carried out on the 
medium and high strength products to demonstrate bioequivalence to Symbicort. 
Lactose is a well-known pharmaceutical ingredient and its quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. Its 
compatibility with the active substances is already known from experience with the innovator product. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The primary packaging is a white inhaler with a translucent wine red mouthpiece cap. The inhaler is made 
of different plastic materials; acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 
and polypropylene (PP). Each inhaler contains either 60 doses (high strength) or 120 doses (middle 
strength) and is foil-wrapped. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 4 main steps: blending of the 2 micronized active substances with 
pre-sieved lactose monohydrate; filling of the homogeneous powder blend into the device sub-assembly, 
followed by assembly of the entire device; equilibration of the filled device; packaging and labelling. The 
manufacturing process is considered to be non-standard. 
Controls are applied to critical steps of the manufacturing process as follows: blend homogeneity testing 
by NGI on multiple samples to ensure adequate blending; measurement of net powder weight in each 
device to ensure correct fill weight; check to ensure each device is assembled correctly; actuation check 
on each device to ensure correct functionality; dose counter check; leak testing to ensure foil pouch seal 
integrity. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated according to the Note for Guidance on 
Process Validation (CPMP/QWP/848/96) and Annex II to Note for Guidance on Process Validation – 
Non-standard Processes (CPMP/QWP/2054/03). Validation data was provided for three batches each of 
the middle and high strength products manufactured according to the registered process description. It 
has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for the production of this 
dry powder inhaler. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications for each strength include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form including appearance of powder (visual description), appearance of inhaler (visual 
inspection), identification (HPLC, UV), related substances (HPLC), formoterol impurity I (HPLC), assay of 
Assessment report

inhaler content (HPLC) moisture content (KF), microbiological contamination (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of 
delivered dose (Ph. Eur.), aerodynamic assessment of fine particles (Ph. Eur.) and number of actuations 
per device (visual inspection). 
Batch analysis results provided for 6 commercial scale batches of high (320/9 µg) strength product, along 
with 3 commercial scale batches of the medium (160/4.5 µg) strength product confirm the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 commercial scale batches each of the medium and high strengths of finished product 
stored under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 18 months and under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 6 months according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing. 
In addition, in-use stability was tested using unwrapped samples stored under long term conditions (25 
ºC / 60% RH) for up to 6 months. An in-use shelf-life of 6 months when stored below 25 oC is granted. 
Samples were tested according to the release specifications except that slightly wider limits are allowed 
for aerodynamic assessment of fine particles and assay of inhaler content. No relevant change or trend to 
any of the measured parameters was observed under either condition. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. The applicant will complete the on-going stability studies on pivotal batches up to the 
proposed shelf-life. In addition, a commitment is made to place a further production batch of each 
strength on stability as per GMP requirements. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development  
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant has not conducted or sponsored any non-clinical studies using budesonide and formoterol 
to support this Marketing Authorisation Application as the pharmacological and toxicological effects of 
both budesonide and formoterol are documented in the published literature. The applicant has chosen to 
rely on the literature on the non-clinical characterisation of budesonide and formoterol and their known 
clinical properties.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology  
The applicant has presented a pharmacology review based on literature reports of budesonide and 
formoterol activity alone and in combination. No new pharmacology studies were performed to support 
this MAA. Budesonide and formoterol are long-established bronchodilators and their pharmacology has 
been well characterised. Budesonide is a glucocorticoid that has local anti-inflammatory effects in the 
respiratory tract. Budesonide efficacy in animal models of airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness 
was demonstrated over 20 years ago. The exact anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of 
glucocorticoids is unknown, but effects include inhibition of neutrophil and monocyte-macrophage 
adherence, phospholipase inhibition of A2 activity, inhibition of eosinophil activation, and inhibition of 
plasma exudation in the bronchial endothelium.  
Formoterol exerts its bronchodilatory action through the β2-adrenoreceptor, leading to cAMP activation 
and relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. Formoterol pharmacology has been characterised in a series 
of studies in isolated animal and human tissue preparations, where it demonstrated effects consistent 
with β2-receptor agonism. Inhibition of release of mast cell mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes 
may contribute to efficacy in airway hypersensitivity. 
In studies performed during the development of the reference product, Symbicort, combination 
ICS/LABA treatment was found to inhibit release of inflammatory mediators in human bronchial epithelial 
cells and lung fibroblasts, inhibit oxidative burst in human eosinophils stimulated by bronchial epithelial 
cell-derived condition medium, inflammation-induced lung edema, proliferation of airway smooth muscle 
cells, production of proteoglycans by lung fibroblasts, and the bronchoconstriction response to 
provocation. Combination ICS/LABA therapies appear to have additive, synergistic, complementary and 
or compensatory effects in pre-clinical models, which underlie the clinical efficacy seen in asthma 
patients.  
Mechanistic studies in the literature are limited but a number are described by the applicant. A study by 
Adner et al suggests ICS treatment may enhance LABA action through upregulation of the 
β2-adrenoreceptor and inhibition of COX-2 mediated receptor desensitization. Similarly, corticosteroids 
attenuated β2-adrenoreceptor desensitization in rats administered salmeterol for 1 week, and increased 
β2-adrenoreceptor mRNA in human lung tissue. A study by Holden et al (2011) also suggest a synergistic 
action through induction of regulator of G-protein signalling 2 (RGS2), which reduces intracellular free 
calcium flux and the subsequent bronchoconstriction. This is supported by characterization of RGS2-/- 
mice, which display increased bronchoconstriction in response to spasmogens. Taken together the 
studies support the well-established clinical efficacy of budesonide and formoterol.

Discussion of secondary pharmacodynamics is limited to a single study of mice with acute lung injury, 
where pre-treatment with a combination of budesonide and formoterol reduced endothelial and cardiac 
dysfunction and associated IL-6 expression. This report is described in primary pharmacodynamics but is 
considered a secondary pharmacodynamic effect. The mechanism of action underlying this observation 
and its clinical relevance is uncertain. No formal safety pharmacology studies have been performed for 
this application. As the clinical safety of the reference product, Symbicort® Turbohaler, is well 
established, nonclinical safety pharmacology studies would not significantly add to the clinical safety of 
the product; thus the lack of studies is acceptable. As the same racemic mixture of formoterol is used as 
the reference product, the report by Abraha et al on the potential adverse effects associated with 
(S,S)-formoterol, is not a concern; the clinical safety profile of formoterol is already well-established. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions are well characterised and are described in the relevant sections of 
the SmPC. The absence of a non-clinical pharmacodynamic interaction summary is acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic studies were performed for this application. The applicant described ADME 
profiles budesonide and formoterol based on available information from assessments of prior 
applications, and published literature reports. Budesonide was rapidly absorbed and with high 
bioavailability following inhalation. Tmax for [3H]-budesonide administered to rats intratracheally was 
about 3 minutes, with a plasma AUC of 61% suggesting high bioavailability. Formoterol is reported to be 
readily absorbed following inhalation.  
In the pharmacokinetic modelling system described by Ewing et al (2008), budesonide and formoterol 
were administered to isolated rat lung by aerosol, with a predicted deposition of ~27 and 37 µg/dose in 
the lung. Both compounds reached peak local concentration rapidly, with Tmax of 2.2 and 6.7 minutes, 
respectively. The study of pulmonary absorption by Tronde et al (2002) in isolated rat lung showed a 
similar absorption profile with rapid absorption of budesonide and more moderate absorption of 
formoterol. Given that the absorption and bioavailability of budesonide and formoterol are 
well-characterised clinically, the applicant’s review is acceptable. 
Human plasma protein binding of formoterol was 61-64% and 31-38% in two separate assays. The 
protein binding of formoterol according to the reference product SmPC is ~50%. Plasma protein binding 
of budesonide is reported to be about 90%. The study by Ewing et al suggests both budesonide and 
formoterol is retained in lung tissue, but budesonide distribution throughout the body is not discussed. 
Formoterol is reported to also distribute to kidney, liver, plasma, heart and brain. Following intratracheal 
administration radioactivity was also detected in stomach, kidney medulla, urine and bile, which 
correlates with the routes of elimination. 
The applicant describes metabolism of formoterol based on assessments of prior applications. Formoterol 
is mainly metabolised by glucuronide conjugation in humans, and by o-demethylation. Budesonide is 
reported to undergo extensive first pass metabolism. The major metabolites budesonide are 
6-beta-hydroxy-budesonide and 16-alfa-hydroxy-prednisolone, formed from both enantiomers, and the 
(R;R)-enantiomer, respectively. The metabolites have less than 1% of the pharmacological activity of the 
parent. Due to the extensive clinical experience with both formoterol and budesonide, the limited review 
of their metabolism is acceptable. 
Formoterol is eliminated primarily through urinary excretion and to a lesser extent by biliary excretion. 
Budesonide was reported to be eliminated mainly through the faeces in rat and dog, and equally through 
faeces and urine in rabbit. Human excretion is through both urine and faeces. Given that the 
pharmacokinetics of both formoterol and budesonide are well characterised clinically, the absence of a 
detailed discussion on excretion is acceptable. 
Assessment report

The applicant has not provided any discussion of pharmacokinetic drug interactions. As relevant 
pharmacokinetic drug interactions have been established clinically with the reference product, and are 
described in SmPC section 4.5, a discussion of a nonclinical PK drug interaction would be of limited use 
and its absence is acceptable. Taken together, as the pharmacokinetics of both active substances are well 
characterised both alone and in combination, there are no nonclinical issues relating to pharmacokinetics 
for this MAA. The limited pharmacokinetic overview is considered sufficient for the hybrid MAA.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No new toxicity studies have been performed for this MAA; the nonclinical toxicology summary is largely 
based on the information available for the Symbicort Turbohaler reference product. No original study 
reports are available. Considering this is a hybrid application this approach is acceptable. 
In single-dose toxicity studies no lethality was seen in rats following administration of inhaled dry powder 
containing 97 mg/kg budesonide and 3 mg/kg formoterol, with a deposited dose of 7.9 and 0.24 mg/kg 
respectively. Treatment was well tolerated with effects on body and spleen, thymus and adrenal gland 
weight decreases attributed budesonide pharmacology. Combination treatment in beagle dogs did not 
cause lethality up to 737 μg/kg budesonide and 22 μg/kg formoterol, with a deposited dose of 117 and 
3.3 μg/kg, respectively. Cardiovascular effects could be attributed to the pharmacological action of 
formoterol. In rat, mouse, and/or dog studies with oral or parenteral administration of either budesonide 
or formoterol alone, LD50 values generally offer a large margin of safety from the proposed clinical dose. 
Major findings for these studies can be attributed to the pharmacological action of each drug. 
Combination of budesonide and formoterol in the 13-week repeat dose rat study produced effects 
including decreased body weight, thymus and spleen effects, which can generally be attributed to the 
pharmacology of budesonide. In the 13 week dog study, additional tachycardic effects were noted, which 
is attributable to formoterol pharmacology, and effects on lymph nodes and adrenal gland, which can be 
attributed to budesonide pharmacology. Neither study identified additive or synergistic toxic effects in the 
combination treatment compared to studies of either drug alone. There are no new nonclinical studies so 
there are no concerns of additional systemic toxicities following repeated administration. 
Both budesonide and formoterol were negative in a battery of genotoxicity tests. The absence of studies 
with the combination is acceptable, as neither compound alone is considered a potential genotoxin. In a 
two year carcinogenicity study in rats, budesonide caused a statistically significant increase in gliomas in 
male rats at an oral dose of 50 µg/kg. In another two year study these findings were not replicated, 
however budesonide caused a statistically significant increase in gliomas in hepatocellular tumors at the 
same dose. In a 2 year study by Ryrfeldt et al, the glucocorticoids budesonide, prednisolone and 
triamcinolone were associated with increased hepatocellular adenomas/carcinomas, suggestive of a 
class-related effect.  
Formoterol was associated with an increase ovarian and uterine leiomyomas in two 2 year rodent 
carcinogenicity studies. As these findings are typically associated with long-term treatment of rats with 
β2-adrenergic drugs, and the clinical relevance is uncertain.  
Combination treatment of inhaled budesonide and formoterol was teratogenic in rats from a dose 12 + 
0.66 µg/kg/day, with a deposited dose of 1.01 + 0.057 µg/kg/day. Effects included umbilical hernia, 
aortic arch and fused stemebra. Teratogenicity and embryolethality is associated with subcutaneous 
administration of budesonide, and with oral doses of formoterol, in rats and rabbits. However in contrast 
to the combination study, in inhalation studies of each drug alone, neither drug was associated with 
teratogenic effects. Taken together the combination treatment is considered to have teratogenic 
potential. Appropriate warnings are included in SmPC section 4.6.

No new studies have been performed to qualify excipients or impurities. The only excipient is lactose 
monohydrate. At the maximum daily exposure with this product, no toxic effects are expected, and the 
lack of specific studies to qualify the excipient is acceptable. As all impurities are present at equal or lower 
levels than in the reference product, or are maintained below the ICH limit of 1.0% (CPMP/ICH/2738/99), 
the impurities are considered qualified through extensive clinical use of the reference product. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
use [EMEA/CHMP/SWP4447/00], a justification for the absence of an environmental risk assessment 
(ERA) has been provided. The applicant stated that the proposed budesonide/formoterol Spiromax 
160/4.5, 320/9 µg per dose, inhalation powder products would replace the currently marketed medicinal 
products and hence the exposure of the environment to budesonide and formoterol is not likely to 
increase. Therefore, the absence of ERA is considered acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
This product is developed to be an equivalent version of the reference product containing the same active 
ingredients, marketed as Symbicort Turbohaler across the EU. As this is a “hybrid” application, the 
absence of new nonclinical studies with this product is acceptable. The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, 
and toxicology of the combination have been characterised for the reference product, and there are no 
new studies in the published literature that would indicate additional concerns. The nonclinical overview 
is considered sufficient for an application of this type. 
Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug interactions are well characterised based on previously 
available data and are described in the relevant sections of the SmPC. Appropriate warnings on the 
teratogenic potential of the combination treatment are included in the SmPC. 
The justification for the absence of an environmental risk assessment ERA is acceptable and an ERA is not 
deemed necessary. The proposed budesonide/formoterol Spiromax 160/4.5, 320/9 µg per dose, 
inhalation powder products are considered unlikely to present a risk to the environment when use as 
prescribed. 
Therefore on the basis of the considerable amount of published scientific evidences on budesonide/ 
formoterol combination, the CHMP concluded that Budesonide/ Formoterol inhalation powder produces 
the claimed pharmacological activity and can be safely administered within therapeutic indication. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical program performed by the applicant was considered adequate to support this hybrid 
application for the treatment of asthma. 
There are no objections to authorisation of this medicinal product from a non-clinical perspective.

The development of this new fixed-dose combination orally inhaled product (OIP) follows the CHMP 
Guideline on OIPs (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) and aims to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of this 
new product to the reference product authorised in a Member State or in the Community on the basis of 
a complete dossier. The development is based on the demonstration of pharmacokinetic equivalence 
between each strength of this fixed-dose combination, BF Spiromax and the corresponding strength of 
the reference product, Symbicort Turbohaler.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Asthma  
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma, where 
use of a combination (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 adrenoceptor agonist) is 
appropriate: 
- in patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled 
short-acting β2 adrenoceptor agonists. 
or 
- in patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2 
adrenoceptor agonists. 
The therapeutic indication stated are covered by the therapeutic indications of the reference fixed-dose 
combination products containing the same active substances and formulated as an inhalation powders in 
the EU Member states (Symbicort Turbohaler 200 micrograms/6 micrograms/inhalation, inhalation 
powder and Symbicort Turbohaler 400 micrograms/12 micrograms/inhalation, inhalation powder). 
The proposed route of administration is for inhalation use.  
Further to pharmacokinetic studies, one pharmacodynamic study has been carried out. No Phase 3 
clinical efficacy or safety studies have been conducted comparing the test and reference products. 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on several occasions pertaining to quality and 
clinical aspects of the dossier. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The studies BFC-AS-102 and BFC-AS-103 are not discussed in detail since the strength 80/4.5 µg was not 
applied for in this application of the medicinal product Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Analytical methods 
Blood for analysis of budesonide and formoterol was collected into tubes. Within 30 minutes of collection, 
samples were centrifuged. Plasma was harvested from each centrifuge tube and aliquoted equally into 
two tubes. The plasma aliquots were immediately frozen at -20°C and maintained frozen state until 
analysis. 
Budesonide 
An LC-MS/MS instrument with positive electro-spray ionization (ESI) multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) 
mode was used to quantify the analyte. All reported analytical data met the data acceptance criteria The 
validated calibration curve ranged from 10.0 pg/mL to 2000 pg/mL. The lower limit of quantitation 
(LLOQ) was 10.0 pg/mL. 
Formoterol 
An LC-MS/MS instrument with positive ESI MRM mode was used to quantify the analyte. All reported 
analytical data met the data acceptance criteria The validated calibration curve ranged from 0.4 pg/mL to 
100 pg/mL . The LLOQ was 0.4 pg/mL. Extraction recovery data from human plasma indicated 97.50% 
and 102.11% of formoterol was recovered at the low and high levels, respectively. Data for long-term 
stability under frozen conditions indicated stability for approximately 258 days at -70°C and 117 days at 
-20°C.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Based on a simulation study with 1,000 runs, it was estimated that a sample size of 80 would provide a 
power of at least 90% to demonstrate bioequivalence, defined as the 90% confidence intervals for both 
the geometric mean AUC0-t ratio and the geometric mean Cmax ratio being contained within (0.8, 1.25), 
for the two treatment comparisons (A vs. B and C vs. D) with respect to both budesonide and formoterol. 
This assumed that as a conservative power calculation, budesonide and formoterol are statistically 
independent, that AUC0-t and Cmax are weakly correlated with a correlation coefficient set at 0.5, that the 
true geometric mean AUC0-t and Cmax ratios between treatment groups are within the range of 0.95 to 
1.05 for both budesonide and formoterol, and that the intra-subject standard deviation of the 
logarithmically transformed data on AUC0-t and Cmax are 0.25 and 0.30, respectively, for both budesonide 
and formoterol. The intra-subject variability assumptions are based on the results from three completed 
PK studies (BFS-AS-103, BFS-AS-105 and BFS-AS-107). Estimating a drop-out rate of 10%, 
approximately 90 subjects were randomised to most studies. 
Statistical analysis 
The  primary  pharmacokinetic  endpoints  in  the  bioequivalence  studies  were:  area  under  the  plasma 
concentration-time  curve  from  time  zero  to the  last quantifiable  concentration as  measured  up  to  24 
hours post-dose (AUC 0-t) and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax). 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for budesonide and formoterol fumarate were calculated by 
non-compartmental analysis methods from the concentration-time data. The AUC0-t was calculated using 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/707217/2014 
Page 25/65 
 
 
 
 
the trapezoidal rule. The AUC0-t and Cmax data were natural log-transformed prior to analysis. 
Comparisons between BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler were carried out using a parametric 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with terms for sequence, period, treatment group and a random 
effect of subject within sequence. The treatment difference and the associated 90% confidence interval 
(CI) were back-transformed to obtain the estimated ratio of geometric means between treatment groups 
and the 90% CI for this ratio. 
Bioavailability 
No bioavailability studies were submitted since the clinical pharmacology of budesonide and formoterol 
fumarate has been investigated extensively in the past, is well known and has been the subject of many 
publications. The development of this new fixed-dose combination OIP aims to demonstrate therapeutic 
equivalence of these new products to appropriate reference products and the development is based on 
the demonstration of pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic equivalence between each strength of 
this fixed-dose combination, BF Spiromax and the corresponding strength of the reference product, 
Symbicort Turbohaler.  
Bioequivalence  
Pilot, supportive and pivotal bioequivalence studies were presented to characterise the pharmacokinetic 
profile of BF Spiromax (test product) and to compare this with that of Symbicort Turbohaler (reference 
product) to assess whether these two fixed-dose combination products are therapeutically equivalent. 
Only the 160/4.5, 320/9 µg strengths are considered in this application. 
All studies saw the recruitment of male and female healthy volunteers and were of similar design: single 
centre, single dose, open-label, crossover studies. Volunteers recruited were aged 18 to 45 years, 
inclusive, had a body mass index of 19 to 30 kg/m2 and a body weight ≥50 kg. Subjects were 
non-smokers for at least 1 year prior to the screening visit and had a maximum smoking history of 5-pack 
years (equivalent of one pack per day for five years). Pregnant women, women trying to become 
pregnant and women who were breast feeding were excluded. All subjects recruited underwent 
appropriate training in the proper use of both the BF Spiromax and the Symbicort Turbohaler devices and 
had to demonstrate an adequate inspiratory flow rate of greater than or equal to 60 litres per minute. 
All studies used the same sampling schedules, pharmacokinetic endpoints and analyses for comparison of 
all pharmacokinetic profiles. All pharmacokinetic parameters for budesonide and formoterol fumarate 
were calculated by non-compartmental analysis methods from the concentration-time data. Area under 
the curve, AUC0-t and AUC 0-inf, Cmax, t max and t ½ were calculated for both budesonide and formoterol 
fumarate in each study. 
The primary endpoints were AUC0-t (calculated using the trapezoidal rule) and C max. Data were natural 
log-transformed prior to statistical analysis. Comparisons between BF Spiromax and Symbicort 
Turbohaler were carried out using a parametric ANOVA model with terms for sequence, period, treatment 
group and a random effect of subject within sequence. The treatment difference and the associated 90% 
CI estimated from the ANOVA analysis on the log scale were back-transformed to obtain the estimated 
ratio of geometric means between treatment groups and the 90% CI for this ratio. BF Spiromax and 
Symbicort Turbohaler were to be considered similar if the 90% CIs of the ratios of geometric means for 
both budesonide and formoterol fumarate were contained within the acceptance range of 0.8 to 1.25. 
However, if the RMS error for Cmax in the ANOVA crossover model exceeded 0.30, indicating high 
intra-subject variability, the acceptance criteria for Cmax could be widened to a maximum of (0.6984, 
1.4319) in line with the CHMP Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/707217/2014 
Page 26/65 
 
 
 
 
Rev. 1/Corr 2012). Comparison of t max between treatment groups was primarily based on the Wilcoxon 
signed rank test applied to the period differences.  
The pharmacokinetic bioequivalence studies in the BF Spiromax clinical development programme were all 
single centre, open-label, single dose, crossover studies, with washout periods ranging across the studies 
from at least 5 days to between 7 and 14 days in duration, set up to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles 
of budesonide and formoterol fumarate administered as BF Spiromax with budesonide and formoterol 
fumarate administered as Symbicort Turbohaler. All studies saw recruitment of male and female healthy 
volunteers, aged 18 to 45 years, inclusive, with no history or current evidence of clinically significant 
concomitant disease.  
In each study, subjects had to complete a training period and demonstrate an adequate inspiratory flow 
rate of ≥ 60 L/min, ability to use both the BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler devices and have no 
tolerability issues with the active drug substances in either BF Spiromax or Symbicort Turbohaler prior to 
entering the treatment phase of the study.  
The pharmacokinetic profiles of budesonide and formoterol fumarate were characterised in each study 
after single doses of two inhalations of study treatments in each treatment period. Two inhalations of both 
the test and reference products were administered in order to optimise the ability to detect budesonide 
and formoterol fumarate over their entire pharmacokinetic profile. Where subjects were randomised to 
receive co-administration of activated charcoal, a suspension of 5 g activated charcoal in water was 
administered 2 minutes before and 2, 62, 122, and 242 minutes after dose inhalation. 
In each study plasma samples were obtained pre-dose, and at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 minutes and 
at 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12.0, 18.0 and 24.0 hours post-dose. Plasma concentrations of 
budesonide and formoterol were determined using validated assay procedures as described. 
The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints in the bioequivalence studies for both budesonide and formoterol 
fumarate were: 
• 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration 
as measured up to 24 hours post-dose (AUC0-t) and  
•  maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)  
In each study, safety was monitored by clinical laboratory examinations, 12-lead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), physical examination, vital signs and recording of adverse events (AEs). 
Each strength of BF Spiromax was developed and evaluated in separate pharmacokinetic studies. 
Pharmacokinetic equivalence was not achieved initially for one or both drug moieties and therefore 
changes to the dose cup size or formulation were made to better match the performance of the Spiromax 
Inhaler to the Turbohaler at a given strength. 
High Strength – Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 320/9 µg per dose, inhalation 
powder  
Four pharmacokinetic equivalence studies were presented in the dossier, one pilot study (BFC-AS-101), 
two supportive studies (BFS-AS-105 and BFS-AS-107) and one pivotal study (BFS-BE-109). These are 
presented below.

Study BFC-AS-101 (n=18) – pilot study at the high strength not powered for formal 
bioequivalence assessments 
This study, an early pilot study not powered for formal bioequivalence but set up to evaluate the in 
vitro/in vivo relationship for BF Spiromax relative to Symbicort Turbohaler, compared two batches of BF 
Spiromax 320/9 µg, each with a different fine particle dose (FPD), with Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12 µg. 
Based on the in vitro/in vivo relationship observed in this pilot study, a pharmacokinetic bioequivalence 
study was carried out to evaluate whether the device and formulation selected for BF Spiromax at the 
high strength could be shown to be bioequivalent to Symbicort Turbohaler.  
For both batches of BF Spiromax, the systemic availability of plasma budesonide was comparable with 
that from Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios of AUClast were contained within the 
acceptance limits of 0.8, 1.25. For the secondary endpoints AUC0-inf and Cmax, the 90% CIs for the ratios 
were also contained within these acceptance limits (0.8, 1.25) but with the exception of Cmax for Batch B, 
which was slightly higher for BF Spiromax than for Symbicort Turbohaler (0.97, 1.31). 
The systemic availability of plasma formoterol fumarate was higher for BF Symbicort Batch A than for 
Symbicort Turbohaler for all endpoints. For Batch B, the systemic availability of formoterol fumarate was 
contained within the acceptance limits (0.8, 1.25) but with the exception of Cmax which was slightly higher 
for BF Spiromax than for Symbicort Turbohaler with the 90% CI for the ratio just outside the acceptance 
range (0.95, 1.30). 
Study BFS-AS-105 (n=88) – initial pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study – a supportive 
study at the high strength  
This study was a single dose, four-period crossover study set up to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles 
of budesonide and formoterol fumarate following administration of BF Spiromax 320/9 µg and Symbicort 
Turbohaler 400/12µg, with and without charcoal blockade, in healthy volunteers. The primary 
pharmacokinetic endpoints were evaluated for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population – 88 subjects were 
randomised to treatment, 83 completed all four treatment periods, all 88 subjects were included in the 
ITT and safety populations.  
Five subjects were withdrawn from the study as follows: 
•  Subject 10002 (Treatment Period 1; Male; BF Spiromax) was withdrawn from the study due to over 
volunteering on 08JAN2010. The subject screened for a study with another CRO while he confirmed 
for admission for Treatment Period 1 of this study. Study drug administration for Treatment Period 1 
was on 05JAN2010. 
•  Subject 10003 (Treatment Period 4; Male; Symbicort Turbohaler + charcoal) was withdrawn from the 
study due to a sleep disorder (cataplexy) on 26JAN2010. Study drug administration for Treatment 
Period 4 was on 26JAN2010, but the subject did not receive the last 2 charcoal doses. 
•  Subject 10053 (Treatment Period 1; Male; Symbicort Turbohaler) was withdrawn due to the use of 
concomitant medication (antibiotics) on 12FEB2010. Study drug administration for Treatment Period 
1 was on 06FEB2010. 
•  Subject 10056 (Treatment Period 3; Female; BF Spiromax + charcoal) was withdrawn due to an 
adverse event (toothache) on 26FEB2010. Study drug administration for Treatment Period 3 was on 
20FEB2010. 
•  Subject 10087 (Treatment Period 3; Female; BF Spiromax + charcoal) was withdrawn due to an 
adverse event (acute gastroenteritis) on 03MAR2010. Study drug administration for Treatment 
Period 3 was on 24FEB2010.

b For t max, this represents the estimated treatment difference. 
In the absence of charcoal blockade, bioequivalence was demonstrated for AUC0-t and AUC0-inf for 
budesonide as the 90% CIs for the ratios were both within the accepted bioequivalence range (0.8, 1.25) 
– see the table above. However Cmax for budesonide was slightly higher for BF Spiromax 320/9 µg than 
for Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12 µg and the 90% CIs for the ratio were not contained within (0.8, 1.25). 
In the presence of charcoal blockade equivalence for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax was demonstrated – 90% 
CIs for the ratios were all within the accepted bioequivalence range (0.8, 1.25). 
No statistically significant differences between the products in terms of time to reach peak budesonide 
concentration in plasma were seen either following charcoal blockade or without charcoal blockade.

In the absence of charcoal blockade, bioequivalence was not demonstrated for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf or Cmax for 
formoterol fumarate as the 90% CIs for all ratios were marginally outside the accepted bioequivalence 
range (0.8, 1.25) – see the table above. However, in the presence of charcoal blockade, bioequivalence 
was demonstrated for all three variables (90% CIs for the ratios were all contained within (0.8, 1.25).  
No statistically significant differences between the products in terms of time to reach peak formoterol 
fumarate concentration in plasma were seen either following charcoal blockade or without charcoal 
blockade. 
Table 4.  Systemic Exposure in BFS-AS-105 (ITT population) 
Minimal change in Cmax and a decrease in AUC were observed for budesonide (13.4%) and formoterol 
fumarate (20.6%) in the presence versus the absence of charcoal blockade following BF Spiromax 
administration. 
In contrast, while AUC0-t was essentially unchanged, Cmax increased by 12.7% for budesonide and 18.4% 
for formoterol fumarate in the presence of charcoal blockade following Symbicort Turbohaler 
administration. The applicant considered this finding unexpected in that charcoal blockade should not 
affect Cmax which is almost entirely due to pulmonary absorption of OIPs. There is no physiological reason 
why Cmax for formoterol fumarate would be higher in the presence versus the absence of charcoal 
blockade as the charcoal block is designed to reduce orally available drug absorption. Furthermore AUC 
should be reduced for both drugs following charcoal blockade due to each having measurable oral 
bioavailability. The expected pattern was observed for BF Spiromax but not for Symbicort Turbohaler; 
according to the applicant this was believed to be due to dose to dose variability from the Turbohaler 
device. This explanation was acknowledged by the CHMP. 
Study BFS-AS-107 (n=72) – second pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study – a supportive 
study at the high strength  
In order to confirm bioequivalence between BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler at the high strength 
following the completion of Study BFC-AS-105 above, Study BFS-AS-107 was set up to further evaluate 
the pharmacokinetic profiles of budesonide and formoterol fumarate in the absence of charcoal blockade. 
This was an open-label, randomised, four-period crossover, replicate treatment, single-dose study to 
compare the pharmacokinetic profile of BF Spiromax 320/9µg with Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12µg in 
healthy volunteers. This study was designed to further evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters as 
measured in Study BFS-AS-105 in which bioequivalence was not established. In addition, this study was 
Assessment report

designed to assess intra-subject variability since high dose-to-dose variability with Symbicort Turbohaler 
was believed to have contributed to the findings in Study BFS-AS-105. In this regard, the intrasubject 
variability with BF Spiromax 320/9µg and Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12µg was also determined from 
replicate treatment arms for both treatments. The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were evaluated for 
both the ITT and the per protocol (PP) population – 72 subjects were randomised to treatment, 70 
completed all four treatment periods, all 72 subjects were included in the ITT and safety populations and 
71 were included in the PP population. This approach followed the written scientific advice received from 
CHMP.

BE = bioequivalence 
As in the earlier studies, again bioequivalence for formoterol fumarate through Cmax was not achieved 
between BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler. The clinical relevance of this finding was evaluated in 
the pharmacodynamic study, Study BFS-AS-106 (described under Pharmacodynamics section below). 
Pivotal pharmacokinetic study BFS-BE-109 (n=90) – third pharmacokinetic bioequivalence 
study (a pivotal study at the high strength) 
Based on the findings in respect of Cmax for formoterol fumarate across studies the applicant considered 
that a common cause maybe responsible for the lack of bioequivalence. In vitro evaluation of possible 
solutions to achieve pharmacokinetic bioequivalence for formoterol fumarate with regard to Cmax, 
suggested that a change in the micronization process for the drug substance, to produce a larger particle 
size, might enable the achievement of pharmacokinetic bioequivalence for the formoterol fumarate 
comparisons of test and reference products. This hypothesis was tested and validated in a pilot study 
carried out with the middle strength of BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohlaer (see study BFS-BE-110 
below). Based on the findings of this pilot study the high strength product was modified by inclusion of 
coarser formoterol fumarate particles and a repeat pivotal pharmacokinetic study with the high strength 
was carried out with and without charcoal blockade.

Study BFS-BE-109 was an open, single-dose, randomised, five-way crossover comparison of the 
pharmacokinetic and safety profiles following two inhalations of BF Spiromax 320/9 mcg Inhalation 
Powder and Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12 mcg, with and without charcoal block in healthy volunteers. 
The study was conducted between June and August 2012 at a single investigative centre in Paris, France. 
Methods 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetic profiles of budesonide and 
formoterol administered as two inhalations from BF Spiromax 320/9 mcg Inhalation Powder and two 
inhalations from Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12 mcg, with and without charcoal block. The secondary 
objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler, and to 
evaluate the intra-subject variability of Symbicort Turbohaler (without charcoal block). 
Eligible subjects were men and women, aged 18–45 years, in good general health with; body mass index 
(BMI) 19 -30 kg/m2, body weight ≥50 kg; not pregnant, breast feeding, or attempting to become 
pregnant; agreement by women of childbearing potential to use appropriate contraception; non-smokers 
for at least one year prior to screening visit and a maximum smoking history of five pack-pack years; 
willing and able to give informed written consent. 
Eligible subjects attended a one day training period where they were trained on device use and tolerability 
to drug substance was assessed. Following successful completion of the training period, subjects entered 
a 7 (±2)-day washout period. During Treatment Periods 1-5, all subjects took two inhalations from the 
DPI device to which they were randomised for each treatment period. Each treatment was followed by a 
7 (±2)-day washout period except for the last treatment period. At the end of the washout period after 
Treatment Periods 1 to 4, the subject was exposed to the next treatment. Safety was monitored by 
clinical laboratory examinations, 12-lead ECGs, physical examination, vital sign measurements, and 
adverse events. For the treatments when subjects were randomised to receive co-administration of 
activated charcoal, a suspension of 5 g activated charcoal in water was administered 2 min before and 2, 
62, 122, and 242 min after dose inhalation. 
The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were AUCt and Cmax for budesonide and formoterol, t max was a 
secondary endpoint, additional endpoints were AUC0-∞ and apparent elimination half-life (t ½).  
The following treatments were administered (treatment B was administered twice in each of ten possible 
dosing schedules, giving five treatment periods): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment A BF Spiromax 320/9 mcg – 2 inhalations 
Treatment B Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12 mcg – 2 inhalations 
Treatment C BF Spiromax 320/9 mcg with 5 g activated charcoal suspended in 25 mL water – 2 
inhalations 
Treatment D Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12 mcg with 5 g activated charcoal suspended in 25 mL 
water– 2 inhalations 
Results 
One hundred and forty-five subjects were screened and 90 recruited to the study three of whom withdrew 
during the treatment periods and 87 completed the study. Subjects’ mean age was 29.4 years (s.d. 6.63) 
and BMI was 23.7 kg/m2 (s.d. 2.8) forty-eight were male.

Analysis of bioequivalence 
For budesonide in the absence of charcoal the test/reference ratio for AUC0-t was 1.014 with 90% CI 
0.979, 1.050 and an RMS error of <0.3. For AUC0-inf the ratio was 1.017 with 90% CI 0.981, 1.054 and 
an RMS error <0.3. For Cmax the ratio was 1.046 with 90% CI 0.982, 1.113 the RMS error was 0.332. 
For budesonide in the presence of charcoal the test/reference ratio for AUC0-t was 1.005 with 90% CI 
0.957, 1.056 and an RMS error of <0.3. For AUC0-inf the ratio was 1.012 with 90% CI 0.962, 1.064 and 
an RMS error <0.3. For Cmax the ratio was 0.994 with 90% CI 0.949, 1.042 the RMS error was <0.03. 
For formoterol in the absence of charcoal the test/reference ratio for AUC0-t was 0.978 with 90% CI 
0.940, 1.018 and an RMS error of <0.3. For AUC0-inf the ratio was 0.989 with 90% CI 0.945, 1.035 and 
RMS error <0.03. For Cmax the ratio was 0.973 with 90% CI 0.922, 1.026 the RMS error was <0.3. 
For formoterol in the presence of charcoal the test/reference ratio for AUC0-t was 0.959 with 90% CI 
0.909, 1.012 and an RMS error of <0.3. For AUC0-inf the ratio was 0.952 with 90% CI 0.895, 1.013 and 
RMS error <0.3. For Cmax the ratio was 1.020 with 90% CI 0.960, 1.083 the RMS error was <0.3. 
In the pivotal study (study BFS-BE-109), the study in which BF Spiromax contained a mix of the same two 
active substances but employed a change in the micronization process for the formoterol fumarate drug 
substance to produce a larger and more coarse formoterol fumarate particle size, BF Spiromax 320/9 µg 
and Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12 µg were shown to be bioequivalent in respect of both budesonide and 
formoterol fumarate pharmacokinetic parameters, when administered both with and without charcoal 
blockade.

Middle Strength – Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 160/4.5 µg per dose, inhalation 
powder  
Three pharmacokinetic equivalence studies were presented in the dossier, one pilot (BFS-BE-110), one 
supportive (BFS-AS-104) and one pivotal study (BFS-BE-108). 
Study BFS-AS-104 (n=90) – fourth pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study – a supportive 
study at the middle strength  
This was an open-label, randomised, five-period crossover study to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles 
of BF Spiromax 160/4.5 µg with Symbicort Turbohaler 200/6 µg administered with and without a 
charcoal blockade. The intra-subject variability with Symbicort Turbohaler was also to be determined by 
replicate treatment of the Symbicort Turbohaler without charcoal treatment arm.  
Subjects were randomised one of 10 treatment sequences and to ensure consistency all dosing occurred 
between 07.00 hours and 09.00 hours. 
The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were AUC0-t and Cmax for both budesonide and formoterol 
fumarate for the PP population. A total of 90 subjects were randomised to treatment and 86 subjects 
completed all five treatment periods. All 90 subjects were included the safety population and 89 were 
included in the ITT and PP populations. 
The root mean square error in the ANOVA crossover exceeded 0.30 for Symbicort Turbohaler, indicating 
high intra-subject variability, therefore the acceptance criteria for Cmax were widened to a maximum of 
(0.698, 1.43)2 for the comparison of BF Spiromax with Symbicort Turbohaler.

Very similar results were obtained using the ITT population.  
Bioequivalence was not demonstrated for any of AUC0-t, AUC0-inf or Cmax either in the presence or absence 
of charcoal for budesonide or formoterol fumarate. The CIs generated for tmax demonstrated no 
statistically significant difference between the test and reference products in terms of time to reach peak 
budesonide or formoterol fumarate concentration in plasma. 
Study BFS-BE-110 (n=20) – pilot study 
This was a pilot study and was not powered for formal bioequivalence assessments. The study was set up 
to evaluate the in vitro/in vivo correlation for BF Spiromax relative to Symbicort Turbohaler for the middle 
strength product, BF Spiromax 160/4.5 µg per dose, inhalation powder and used four batches of BF 
Spiromax each with a different formulation and different in vitro performance characteristics. The study 
assessed key formulation parameters identified in the in vivo studies: 
•  Metered dose (device cup volume) 
• 
Formulation blend strength 
•  Drug substance particle size and lactose particle size.  
The formulation options are summarised in the table below:

Table 13.   BF Spiromax Formulation Options Investigated in Study BFS-BE-110 
This was a single-centre, open-label, single-dose, five-way crossover study and to ensure consistency, all 
dosing occurred between 08.00 hours and 10.00 hours. Subjects were randomised to one of 10 treatment 
sequences. 
The primary objective was to assess the pharmacokinetic profiles of budesonide and formoterol fumarate 
following two inhalations from four batches of BF Spiromax (Batch A, Batch B, Batch C and Batch D) and 
two inhalations from a single batch of Symbicort Turbohaler. The study used BF Spiromax 160/4.5 µg and 
Symbicort Turbohaler 200/6 µg. 
A total of 20 subjects were randomised to treatment. Eighteen subjects completed all five treatment 
periods. One subject had a motor bike accident between treatment periods 4 and 5 and withdrew and one 
subject experienced mild cough between treatment period 2 and 3. The 18 subjects who completed the 
study were included in the PP population. All randomised subjects were included in the safety and ITT 
populations. 
In vitro evaluation of possible solutions to achieve pharmacokinetic bioequivalence for formoterol 
fumarate with regard to C max, suggested that a change in the micronisation process for the drug 
substance, to produce a larger particle size, might enable the achievement of pharmacokinetic 
bioequivalence for the formoterol fumarate comparisons of test and reference products.  
The findings were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
For batches A and C of BF Spiromax the systemic availability of plasma budesonide was not 
comparable with Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios of AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax 
were not contained within (0.8, 1.25) 
For batches B and D of BF Spiromax the systemic availability of plasma budesonide was comparable 
with Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios of AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf were contained 
within (0.8, 1.25); however, Cmax, for both batch B and batch D was not contained within (0.8, 1.25); 
For all four batches, there were no appreciable differences between BF Spiromax and Symbicort 
Turbohaler with respect to BUD t½ and t max. 
For batches A and D of BF Spiromax, the systemic availability of plasma formoterol fumarate was 
comparable with Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios of AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf were

contained within (0.8, 1.25); however, Cmax, for both batches was not contained within (0.8, 1.25). 
Both of these batches utilised the original formoterol fumarate drug substance; 
• 
• 
For batch B of BF Spiromax, the systemic availability of plasma formoterol fumarate was comparable 
with Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios of AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax were all 
contained within (0.8, 1.25); 
For batch C the systemic availability of plasma formoterol fumarate was not comparable with 
Symbicort Turbohaler and the 90% CIs for the ratios of AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax were not contained 
within (0.8, 1.25).  
•  Both batch B and batch C used formoterol fumarate drug substance from the new micronization 
process which resulted in a larger particle size; 
• 
For all four batches there were no appreciable differences between BF Spiromax and Symbicort 
Turbohaler with respect to FOR t ½ and t max. 
A higher formoterol Cmax was observed for BF Spiromax compared with Symbicort Turbohaler. As 
explained above, subsequent further in vitro evaluation of BF Spiromax aiming at achieving 
pharmacokinetic bioequivalence for formoterol fumarate Cmax suggested that a change in the 
micronisation process for the formoterol fumarate drug substance, such that a larger particle would be 
produced, might help achieve bioequivalence for all formoterol fumarate comparisons. This hypothesis 
was tested and validated in this pilot pharmacokinetic study carried out with the middle strengths of BF 
Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler (study BFS-BE-110). The results indicated that the smaller the 
particle size the higher the formoterol fumarate Cmax and that a larger, coarser particle size produced a 
lower Cmax.  
The use of formoterol fumarate drug substance micronised by an alternative micronisation process, 
resulting in larger particles, appeared to correct this difference between the test and reference products 
in Cmax for the high and middle strength products. Therefore, the applicant stated their intention to use 
this new fomoterol fumarate formulation (with larger, coarser particles). 
Based on the findings of the pilot study (study BFS-BE-110), the middle strength BF Spiromax product 
was modified also by the use of the high strength formulation which was subsequently filled into a 
half-sized dose cup device and by a change in the micronisation process for the formoterol fumarate drug 
substance and a change in the grade of lactose, to produce a larger and coarser particle size. All other 
components and manufacturing processes were the same as in the (initial) supportive pharmacokinetic 
bioequivalence study at the middle strength (study BFS-AS-104). 
Study BFS-BE-108 (n=90) – fifth pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study – a pivotal study at 
the middle strength 
Study BFS-BE-108 was an open-label, single-dose, randomised, five-way crossover comparison of the 
pharmacokinetic and safety profiles following two inhalations of BF Spiromax 160/4.5 mcg Inhalation 
Powder and Symbicort Turbohaler 200/6 mcg, with and without charcoal block in healthy volunteers. 
The study was conducted from July to September 2012 at a single investigative centre in France.  
Methods 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of budesonide and 
formoterol administered as two inhalations from BF Spiromax 160/4.5 mcg Inhalation Powder and two 
inhalations from Symbicort Turbohaler 200/6 mcg, with and without charcoal block, in healthy 
volunteers. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BF Spiromax and

Symbicort Turbohaler, and to evaluate the intra-subject variability of Symbicort Turbohaler (without 
charcoal block). 
Eligible subjects were men and women, aged 18–45 years, in good general health with; body mass index 
(BMI) 19 -30 kg/m2, body weight ≥50 kg; not pregnant, breast feeding, or attempting to become 
pregnant; agreement by women of childbearing potential to use appropriate contraception; non-smokers 
for at least one year prior to screening visit and a maximum smoking history of five pack-pack years; 
willing and able to give informed written consent. 
Eligible subjects attended a one day training period where they were trained on device use and tolerability 
to drug substance was assessed. Following successful completion of the training period, subjects entered 
a 7 (±2)-day washout period. During Treatment Periods 1-5, all subjects took two inhalations from the 
DPI device to which they were randomised for each treatment period. Each treatment was followed by a 
7 (±2)-day washout period except for the last treatment period. At the end of the washout period after 
Treatment Periods 1 to 4, the subject was exposed to the next treatment. Safety was monitored by 
clinical laboratory examinations, 12-lead ECGs, physical examination, vital sign measurements, and 
adverse events. For the treatments when subjects were randomised to receive co-administration of 
activated charcoal, a suspension of 5 g activated charcoal in water was administered 2 min before and 2, 
62, 122, and 242 min after dose inhalation.  
The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were AUCt and Cmax for budesonide and formoterol, t max was a 
secondary endpoint, additional endpoints were AUC0-∞ and apparent elimination half-life (t 1/2).  
The following treatments were administered: (treatment B was administered twice in each of ten possible 
treatment sequences): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment A BF Spiromax 160/4.5 mcg – 2 inhalations 
Treatment B Symbicort Turbohaler 200/6 mcg – 2 inhalations 
Treatment C BF Spiromax 160/4.5 mcg with 5 g activated charcoal suspended in 25 mL water – 2 
inhalations 
Treatment D Symbicort Turbohaler 200/6 mcg with 5 g activated charcoal suspended in 25 mL water 
– 2 inhalations 
Results 
One hundred and fifty-seven subjects were screened and 90 recruited to the study, two of whom did not 
receive study medication and are excluded from analysis; eighty six subjects completed the study. 
Subjects’ mean age was 27.7 years (s.d. 7.34) and BMI was 23.5 kg/m2 (s.d. 2.7) fifty-one were male.

Pharmacokinetic bioequivalence for budesonide, with and without charcoal blockade was observed for all 
strengths with the exception of two of the supportive studies: 
• 
• 
the high strength supportive study (study BFS-AS-105) (n=88) – initial pharmacokinetic 
bioequivalence study – this was considered by the applicant to be a spurious result and out-of-line 
with other pharmacokinetic studies presented  
the middle strength supportive study (study BFS-AS-104) (n=90) – fourth pharmacokinetic 
bioequivalence study – the findings in this study resulted in a change in the micronisation process for 
formoterol fumarate and a change in the grade of lactose, with subsequent modification of both the 
high strength and the middle strength products by inclusion of coarser formoterol fumarate particles 
(see study BFS-BE-110). 
Data from food-interaction studies 
No food effect studies have been submitted. This is acceptable since the clinical pharmacology of 
budesonide and formoterol fumarate has been investigated extensively in the past, is well known and has 
been the subject of many publications. The development of these new fixed-dose combination OIP aims 
to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of this new products to appropriate reference products and the 
development is based on the demonstration of pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic equivalence 
between each strength of this fixed-dose combination, BF Spiromax and the corresponding strength of 
the reference product, Symbicort Turbohaler. 
There are no known relevant interactions between either of these actives, budesonide and formoterol 
fumarate and food intake and no adverse effects of food on the rate and/or extent of absorption of either 
active. 
Budesonide undergoes extensive first pass hepatic biotransformation, approximately 90%, to 
metabolites of low glucocorticoid activity (less that 1% of that of budesonide); formoterol fumarate is 
inactivated by conjugation. 
Distribution 
No studies have been submitted, which is acceptable since the clinical pharmacology of budesonide and 
formoterol fumarate has been investigated extensively in the past, is well known and has been the 
subject of many publications. The development of these new fixed-dose combination OIPs aims to 
demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of these new products to appropriate reference products, 
investigating equivalence between each strength of this fixed-dose combination, BF Spiromax and the 
corresponding strength of the reference product, Symbicort Turbohaler.

Elimination 
There is no discussion and no studies have been submitted. This is acceptable for the same reasons 
stated above for lack of distribution studies. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In vitro dose proportionality for formoterol fumarate between the middle strength products compared 
with the high strength has been established. The specifications of FPD and delivered dose of the middle 
strength products are in line with the high strength product. 
Special populations 
No studies in special populations have been submitted, which is acceptable for the same reasons as for 
the lack of data on distribution and elimination. The adults recruited in the clinical programme presented 
(a total of nine pharmacokinetic studies and one pharmacodynamic study) were healthy volunteers. No 
clinical studies have been submitted in adults or adolescents with asthma. 
The CHMP Guideline on orally inhaled products (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) states that “Unless justified 
otherwise, comparative in vitro data on flow rate dependence should be obtained with a range of flow 
rates. This range should be justified in relation to the intended patient population. The minimum (e.g. 
10th percentile), median and maximum (e.g. 90th percentile) achievable flow rate in this patient 
population(s) should be investigated.” 
Taking the above into account, the applicant submitted data on the inhalation characteristics of healthy 
adult volunteers (aged 18 to 45 years), adults (18 to 45 years), adolescents 12 to 17 years) and children 
(6 to 11 years) with asthma and adults over 50 years of age with COPD in order to bridge the findings in 
the clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers to different patient populations, including those 
where this fixed-dose combination product will be used. The indication proposal from the applicant does 
not include COPD and children and adolescents with asthma; therefore data in these populations is to be 
regarded only as supportive for overall inhalation characteristics.  This study aimed at showing the 
appropriateness of the pharmacokinetic findings obtained in healthy volunteers to support equivalence in 
patients and in other populations with low inspiratory capacity, taking into account the differences in in 
vitro flow rates at low flow rates and differences in peak inspiratory flow rates between healthy volunteers 
and the different patient populations in whom this fixed-dose combination will be used. It was a study of 
peak inspiratory flow rates (PIFR) generated from the proposed Spiromax device and the Turbohaler 
device by various patient groups (pre- and post-enhanced device training). Four patient groups were 
included in the study as follows (n=50 in each of the four study groups listed): 
•  Children and adolescents with asthma aged 6-17 years 
•  Adults with asthma aged 18-45 years 
•  Adults with COPD aged >50 years (indication in this population is not applied for in this application) 
•  Healthy volunteers aged 18-45 years 
Overall results obtained from this study are presented below. Results in children and adolescents are not 
discussed in detail as this age group is not included in the claimed indication for this product.

Healthy volunteers and patients were able to generate a slightly higher inspiratory flow rate from the 
Spiromax device than from the Turbohaler device. 
In asthma, the 10th percentile was equal to or greater than 50L/min in children, adolescents and adults 
using both inhalation devices. 
The PIFR 90th percentile was between 84-105L/min for all patient groups. 
The PIFR 50th percentile was between 60-88L/min for all patient groups. 
Few subjects had a mean PIFR below 40L/min – with no clustering by age or asthma severity (as defined

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No in vitro/in vivo studies have been submitted. Interactions with other medicinal products are well 
known and well documented.  
There are no known indications of any relevant metabolic interactions or any displacement reactions 
between either of these actives, budesonide and formoterol fumarate, neither in vitro nor in vivo. 
Budesonide undergoes extensive first pass hepatic biotransformation, approximately 90%, to 
metabolites of low glucocorticoid activity (less that 1% of that of budesonide); formoterol fumarate is 
inactivated by conjugation. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Budesonide is an orally inhaled glucocorticosteroid with high local anti-inflammatory activity and a lower 
incidence of adverse effects than is seen with oral corticosteroids. Budesonide has been shown to 
decrease airways reactivity to histamine and methacholine in patients with hyperreactive airways. 
Inhaled budesonide is recommended for use in the management of patients with asthma.

Formoterol fumarate dihydrate is a selective long-acting β2 adrenergic agonist and exerts a preferential 
effect on β2 adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle to produce relaxation and 
bronchodilatation. Formoterol is used via the orally inhaled route in the management of patients with 
reversible airways obstruction. Formoterol produces bronchodilation within 1-3 minutes following 
inhalation, which lasts for 12 hours following a single dose. Formoterol is particularly useful in patients 
with reversible airways obstruction who continue to experience symptoms despite treatment with an 
anti-inflammatory agent such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Guidelines for the management of reversible 
airways obstruction and particularly asthma recommend the addition of a long-acting β2 agonist to the 
treatment regimen in these patients and studies have shown that the addition of a long-acting β2 agonist 
provides better control of asthma than increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. 
The mechanisms of action of the two drugs, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate are different 
but complementary. Budesonide and formoterol fumarate demonstrate additive effects. 
Primary pharmacology 
The applicant has not generated any new data relating to the primary pharmacology of the active 
substances, which is acceptable for this hybrid application. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The applicant has conducted two studies of the secondary pharmacodynamic action of the combination 
budesonide/formoterol. Study BFS-AS-106 addressed the effects of the combination primarily on the 
cardiovascular system in healthy adults thus evaluating the LABA component. Study BFS-AS305 
examined the effect of the combination on growth and cortisol excretion in asthmatic children thus 
evaluating the ICS component. However, as a paediatric indication is not sought the latter study is not 
represented in this assessment report. 
Study BFS-AS-106 
This was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, cumulative dose, four period crossover study to 
evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler in healthy volunteers. 
The study was conducted at a single UK centre from October to December 2010. 
Methods 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the pharmacodynamic, extra-pulmonary, effects of BF 
Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler after cumulative delivered doses of formoterol, administered as 
1+1+2+4 inhalations of BF Spiromax low dose compared to Symbicort low dose and BF Spiromax high 
dose compared to Symbicort high dose in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 45 years. The secondary 
objective was to evaluate the safety of BF Spiromax and Symbicort after cumulative delivered doses of 
formoterol.  
Eligible subjects were healthy men and women 18 to 45 years of age at screening visit. If female, 
currently not pregnant, breast feeding, or attempting to become pregnant and was of non-childbearing 
potential, or using a consistent and acceptable method of birth control. They had a body mass index of 19 
to 30 kg/m2 and a body weight ≥50 kg, resting sitting HR of ≥50 to ≤90 beats per minute; blood pressure 
of ≤140/90 mmHg; non-smokers for at least 1 year and had a maximum smoking history of five-pack 
years. Each subject participated in the study for approximately 6 to 8 weeks.

The primary endpoint was change from baseline in corrected QT interval using the Fridericia correction 
formula (QTcF) at 5 minutes after each of the four cumulative doses; a treatment difference of 10 msec 
or less was set as the non-inferiority margin. 
Secondary endpoints were change from baseline in QTcF at 15 minutes after each of the four cumulative 
doses; change from baseline in QTcB (Bazett’s correction) at 5 and 15 minutes after each of the four 
cumulative doses; baseline corrected QTcF area under the curve from time 0 to 4 hours (AUC0-4hr) 
following the administration of the last cumulative dose; baseline corrected QTcB AUC0-4hr following the 
administration of the last cumulative dose. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured 
manually and relevant biochemistry.  
Treatments were as shown below, figures in parenthesis are the cumulative dose of formoterol: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment A: BF Spiromax 80/4.5 mcg and placebo Symbicort Turbohaler (4.5/9/18/36) 
Treatment B: Symbicort Turbohaler 100/6 mcg and placebo BF Spiromax (6/12/24/48) 
Treatment C: BF Spiromax 320/9 mcg and placebo Symbicort Turbohaler (9/18/36/72) 
Treatment D: Symbicort Turbohaler 400/12 mcg and placebo BF Spiromax (12/24/48/96) 
Cumulative delivered dose of 36 mcg of formoterol administered as 1+1+2+4 inhalations with 29, 28, 
and 26 minutes between each set following the first inhalation set. The cumulative dose of formoterol was 
administered in a double-blinded manner using matched inhalations of BF Spiromax and placebo 
Symbicort Turbohaler. Each inhalation within a set was to be completed within 30 seconds. 
Results 
One hundred and twenty-four subjects were screened and fifty-six randomised; fifty-two subjects 
completed all phases of the study. Subjects’ mean age was 28.7 years (s.d. 6.66) and BMI was 24.26 
kg/m2 (s.d. 2.8) thirty-eight were male.  
Data for the primary variable QTcF for the low strength (not applied for in this application) comparison are 
shown in the table and figure below; equivalent data, as well as changes in non-corrected QT interval for 
the high strength comparison are also presented. 
For the lower strength heart rate rose by a maximum of approximately 10 bpm (after the third dose) for 
both products and systolic blood pressure by approximately 3 mm Hg. For the high strength comparison 
the maximum change in heart rate was 21.6 bpm for BF Spiromax at four hours and 14.0 for Symbicort 
at four hours. The maximum change from baseline in systolic blood pressure was 15.5 mm Hg for BF 
Spiromax and 11.9 mm Hg for Symbicort. Changes in serum potassium over time for the low and high 
strength comparisons and changes in blood glucose are shown below.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of budesonide and formoterol fumarate has been investigated extensively in 
the past, is well known and has been the subject of many publications. The development of these new 
fixed-dose combination OIPs aims to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of these new products to 
appropriate reference products and the development is primarily based on the demonstration of 
pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic equivalence between each strength of this fixed-dose 
combination, BF Spiromax and the corresponding strength of the reference product, Symbicort 
Turbohaler. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/707217/2014 
Page 50/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant has conducted a well-designed and executed programme of clinical studies to demonstrate 
the bioequivalence of the BF Spiromax (test) range of products with the reference Symbicort. The 
difficulty of demonstrating bioequivalence of orally inhaled products is widely acknowledged and this is 
particularly so for a fixed dose combination for inhalation. The programme involved several clinical trials 
from pilot, though supportive to pivotal and required reformulation of the test active pharmaceutical 
ingredient (API) formoterol component. For the high and intermediate strengths bioequivalence for 
budesonide and formoterol were demonstrated. For a lower strength 80/4.5 mcg bioequivalence of Cmax 
for formoterol was not demonstrated, and the applicant does not seek approval for that strength. The 
applicant proposes to confine the therapeutic indication to use in adults 18 years of age and older only. 
The CHMP Guideline on orally inhaled products (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) does state that 
pharmacokinetic studies should be carried out in the intended patient population. However, it is 
considered that healthy adult volunteers without the bronchoconstriction of asthma and who are less 
variable are more discriminative than patients with asthma, as bronchoconstriction of the airways in the 
patient with asthma may result in greater central pulmonary deposition and two inhaled products then 
appearing to be more similar that they actually are. Furthermore although the expiratory capacity in 
patients with asthma is compromised, the inspiratory capacity is much less so and generally similar to 
that of healthy volunteers. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the recruitment of healthy volunteers in 
the bioequivalence studies presented is acceptable. 
The applicant submitted additional data on the inhalation characteristics of healthy adult volunteers, 
adults, adolescents and children with asthma in order to bridge the findings in the clinical pharmacology 
studies in healthy volunteers to the target patient populations in whom this fixed-dose combination 
product will be used. Although the elderly were not studied per se, the inhalation characteristics in 
patients with COPD and over 50 years of age were and this is acceptable in the lack of a specific study of 
the elderly over 65 years of age. 
The CHMP concluded the following: 
• 
It would appear that regardless of age and underlying disease severity, children, adolescents and 
adults with asthma (as well as patients with COPD) can achieve inspiratory flow rates through both 
the Spiromax device and Turbohaler device.  
•  While flow through both devices was lower in patients with asthma relative to healthy volunteers, the 
mean PIFR achieved by asthma patients was over 60 L/min, flow rates at which the Spiromax device 
and the Turbohaler device are known to deliver comparable amounts of drug to the lungs and at 
which optimal drug deposition in the lung is achieved with the Turbohaler device. 
•  Very few patients had PIFRs below 40 L/min. When PIFRs were less than 40 L/min there appeared to 
be no clustering by age or disease severity. 
In the lack of appropriate clinical data in children, the requirement of Section 9 of the CHMP Guideline on 
orally inhaled products (CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) in respect of the interpolation from data generated 
in adults in the light of specific studies in children having been carried out, which states: “For adolescents 
aged between 12 and 17 years, interpolation from data generated in studies in adults may be possible if 
specific studies have been carried out in children less than 12 years of age. If this is not possible a 
sufficient number of adolescents should be recruited to the adult studies such that the entire age range 
of intended use (12 years through to the elderly) has been studied. Stratification into a 12 to 17 years age 
group and 18 years and above is not necessarily required; however data generated (both efficacy and 
safety data) from the two age groups should be documented and analysed separately, if possible. If 
studies have not been carried out in children (less than 12 years of age) authorisation in adolescents may 
require the generation of clinical data in the adolescent as a specific sub-population…” cannot be met. 
Therefore at this stage in the development of this fixed-dose combination product, as neither children nor 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/707217/2014 
Page 51/65 
 
 
 
 
adolescents have been studied appropriately in the development programme submitted with these 
applications, the CHMP recommended that the this product should not be authorised for use in 
adolescents at this time and that the lower limit of the age range for use of this fixed-dose combination 
should be 18 years. As the reference product, containing the same drug substances, is authorised for use 
in adolescents there is a sizeable risk, as there is with children 12 years of age and younger, that this new 
product will also be used “off-licence” in adolescents. In order to mitigate this risk, sections 4.1 and 4.2 
of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) state that Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
is indicated in adults 18 years of age and older only and in addition section 4.2 states that 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is not indicated for use in children, 12 years of age and 
younger or adolescents, 13 to 17 years of age. The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The CHMP recommended that further development of this new fixed-dose combination product in children 
and adolescents should be considered particularly in the light of this combination containing an inhaled 
corticosteroid. In addition, the CHMP recommended that demonstration of therapeutic equivalence in 
respect of both efficacy and safety and an appropriate benefit/risk balance in this age group should be 
demonstrated should the applicant seek approval of the lower strength fixed-dose combination. 
The CHMP noted that the modification of the micronisation process for formoterol fumarate drug 
substance, such that a larger particle is produced, resulted in a lowering of the confidence intervals not 
only for formoterol fumarate but also for budesonide and for the middle strength product, with the 
exception of Cmax without charcoal for formoterol fumarate. The confidence intervals did not include unity. 
The pharmacokinetic data generated were consistently lower for BF Spiromax than for the reference 
product, Symbicort Turbohaler, particularly for budesonide. The in vitro performance of the BF Spiromax 
batch was inferior to the Symbicort Turbohaler batch with regards to FPD. If batches of the two products 
which were more similar in in vitro characteristics had been used, unity might have been included in the 
confidence intervals.  
The CHMP therefore concluded that the two pivotal pharmacokinetic studies in the high strength (320/9 
µg per dose) and the middle strength (160/4.5 µg per dose), carried out with the proposed modified 
micronisation process to the larger, coarser particle size, demonstrated equivalence between BF 
Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler for all comparisons both with and without a charcoal blockade. The 
change in the micronisation process resulted in some slight lowering of Cmax, in the absence of charcoal 
blockade, for both formoterol fumarate (as required from earlier study results) and budesonide in BF 
Spiromax such that equivalence for all comparisons was shown. 
The study design, objectives and endpoints of Study BFS-AS-106 are acceptable. For the majority of the 
pharmacodynamic endpoints assessed in Study BFS-AS-106, greater changes were observed in the 
measured parameters at 5 minutes post-dose than at 15 minutes post-dose which fits with the rapid rise 
and fall seen in formoterol fumarate Cmax. This pattern of change occurred following successively higher 
doses up to the administration of the last cumulative dose, indicating that the changes in 
pharmacodynamic measures were driven by administration of the next higher dose rather than by 
carryover effects from the earlier, lower dose in the cumulative dosing. The Pharmacodynamic study 
BFS-AS-106 demonstrated equivalence with the reference product. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of budesonide and formoterol fumarate has been investigated extensively in 
the past, is well known and has been the subject of many publications.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/707217/2014

The study design with recruitment of healthy adult male and female volunteers, the sampling schedules, 
pharmacokinetic endpoints and analyses for comparison of all pharmacokinetic profiles are acceptable for 
studies of this type.  
Although the elderly were not studied per se, the inhalation characteristics in patients with COPD and over 
50 years of age were and this is acceptable in the lack of a specific study of the elderly over 65 years of 
age. Additional data provided bridge the findings in the clinical pharmacology studies in healthy 
volunteers to the target patient populations in whom this fixed-dose combination product will be used. 
The two pivotal pharmacokinetic studies in the high strength (320/9 µg per dose) and the middle strength 
(160/4.5 µg per dose), carried out with the proposed modified micronisation process to the larger, 
coarser particle size, demonstrated equivalence between BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler for all 
comparisons both with and without a charcoal blockade. The change in the micronisation process resulted 
in some slight lowering of Cmax, in the absence of charcoal blockade, for both formoterol fumarate (as 
required from earlier study results) and budesonide in BF Spiromax such that equivalence for all 
comparisons was shown.  
The Pharmacodynamic study BFS-AS-106 demonstrates equivalence with the reference product. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The development of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is based on the demonstration of 
pharmacokinetic equivalence between each strength of this fixed-dose combination, BF Spiromax and the 
corresponding strength of the reference product, Symbicort Turbohaler. 
The clinical efficacy of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate has been investigated extensively, 
is well known and has been the subject of many publications.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical development was performed in line with the CHMP Guideline on orally inhaled products 
(CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1). The clinical development of BF Spiromax aims to demonstrate therapeutic 
equivalence of this new product to the reference product authorised in a Member State or in the 
Community on the basis of a complete dossier. The development is based on the demonstration of 
pharmacokinetic equivalence between each strength of this fixed-dose combination, BF Spiromax and the 
corresponding strength of the reference product, Symbicort Turbohaler and supported by a 
pharmacodynamic study.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  presence  of  clinical  efficacy  studies  comparing  the  test  and  reference  products  in  adults  or 
adolescents is not required since the clinical efficacy of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 
has  been  investigated  extensively,  is  well  known  and  has  been  the  subject  of  many  publications. 
Moreover, this is in line with the CHMP Guideline on orally inhaled products (CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) 
as equivalence has been demonstrated for the high strength (320/9 µg per dose) and the middle strength 
(160/4.5 µg per dose) products.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate has been investigated extensively, is 
well known and has been the subject of many publications.  
The applicant has assessed and presented the safety data generated in the clinical pharmacology studies 
presented in support of these applications. No Phase III safety studies in adults, including long-term 
safety studies, have been included in the submitted dossier. 
Systemic effects of the long-acting β2 agonist, formoterol fumarate have been assessed in Study 
BFS-AS-106 (see section ‘Pharmacodynamics’). 
Six-hundred and twenty eight adult healthy volunteers and 77 paediatric patients with persistent asthma 
received at least one dose of study treatment in the clinical development program for BF Spiromax. In the 
single-dose PK studies, 268 subjects received high strength, 198 received middle strength and 106 
received low strength products. A total of 56 subjects received cumulative doses of high and low strength 
products in the PD study and 77 subjects received 2-weeks treatment with low strength products in the 
paediatric study.  
The number of subjects and patients exposed is appropriate to the type of development; all strengths 
were studied and no issues arise from the safety data presented.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate has been investigated extensively, is 
well known and has been the subject of many publications.  
The lack of the submission of a full clinical safety programme is acceptable in this type of application and 
is in line with the CHMP Guideline on orally inhaled products (CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) as equivalence 
has been demonstrated for the high strength (320/9 µg per dose) and the middle strength (160/4.5 µg 
per dose) products. 
The applicant has assessed and presented the safety data generated in the clinical pharmacology studies 
presented in support of these applications. No safety issues arise from this data. No Phase III safety 
studies in adults, including long-term safety studies, have been included in the submitted dossier. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The clinical safety of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate has been investigated extensively, is 
well known and has been the subject of many publications. 
The high dose and the medium dose of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. have been shown to be 
equivalent to the reference product. Hence their unfavourable effects are expected to be similar to the 
well-known safety profile of the reference product (Symbicort Turbohaler) when used in line with the 
approved indication and posology of the reference product.

glucocorticosteroid 
effects 
Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly 
at high doses prescribed for long periods. These effects are much less 
likely to occur with inhalation treatment than with oral corticosteroids. 
Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid 
features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and 
adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma 
and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects 
including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, 
depression or aggression (particularly in children) (see section 4.8). 
It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged 
treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth 
is slowed, therapy should be re-evaluated with the aim of reducing the 
dose of inhaled corticosteroid to the lowest dose at which effective 
control of asthma is maintained, if possible. The benefits of the 
corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression 
must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to 
referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.  
Limited data from long-term studies suggest that most children and 
adolescents treated with inhaled budesonide will ultimately achieve 
their adult target height. However, an initial small but transient 
reduction in growth (approximately 1 cm) has been observed. This 
generally occurs within the first year of treatment. 
Potential effects on bone density should be considered, particularly in 
patients on high doses for prolonged periods that have co-existing risk 
factors for osteoporosis. Long-term studies with inhaled budesonide in 
children at mean daily doses of 400 micrograms (metered dose) or in 
adults at daily doses of 800 micrograms (metered dose) have not 
shown any significant effects on bone mineral density. No information 
regarding the effect of a budesonide/formorterol fumarate dihydrate 
fixed dose combination at higher doses is available.  
If there is any reason to suppose that adrenal function is impaired from 
previous systemic steroid therapy, care should be taken when 
transferring patients to a budesonide / formoterol fumarate fixed dose 
combination therapy.  
The benefits of inhaled budesonide therapy would normally minimise 
the need for oral steroids, but patients transferring from oral steroids 
may remain at risk of impaired adrenal reserve for a considerable time. 
Recovery may take a considerable amount of time after cessation of 
oral steroid therapy and hence oral steroid-dependent patients 
transferred to inhaled budesonide may remain at risk from impaired 
adrenal function for some considerable time. In such circumstances 
hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis function should be 
monitored regularly. Prolonged treatment with high doses of inhaled 
corticosteroids, particularly higher than recommended doses, may also 
result in clinically significant adrenal suppression. Therefore additional

systemic corticosteroid cover should be considered during periods of 
stress such as severe infections or elective surgery. Rapid reduction in 
the dose of steroids can induce acute adrenal crisis. Symptoms and 
signs which might be seen in acute adrenal crisis may be somewhat 
vague but may include anorexia, abdominal pain, weight loss, 
tiredness, headache, nausea, vomiting, decreased level of 
consciousness, seizures, hypotension and hypoglycaemia. 
Treatment with supplementary systematic steroids or inhaled 
budesonide should not be stopped abruptly. During transfer from oral 
therapy toa budesonide/formoterol fumarate fixed dose combination 
therapy, a generally lower systemic steroid action will be experienced 
which may result in the appearance of allergic or arthritic symptoms 
such as rhinitis, eczema and muscle and joint pain. Specific treatment 
should be initiated for these conditions. A general insufficient 
glucocorticosteroid effect should be suspected if, in rare cases, 
symptoms such as tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting should 
occur. In these cases a temporary increase in the dose of oral 
glucocorticosteroids is sometimes necessary. 
Section 4.8, undesirable effects, SmPC: 
Systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at 
high doses prescribed for long periods. These effects are much less 
likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects 
include Cushing´s syndrome, cushingoid features, adrenal 
suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease 
in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Increased 
susceptibility to infections and impairment of the ability to adapt to 
stress may also occur. Effects are probably dependent on dose, 
exposure time, concomitant and previous steroid exposure and 
individual sensitivity.  
Prescription-only medicine 
Section 4.4, special warnings and precautions for use, SmPC: 
A fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate should be administered with caution in patients with 
thyrotoxicosis, phaeochromocytoma, diabetes mellitus, untreated 
hypokalaemia, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, idiopathic 
subvalvular aortic stenosis, severe hypertension, aneurysm or other 
severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, 
tachyarrhythmias or severe heart failure.  
Caution should be observed when treating patients with prolongation 
of the QTc-interval. Formoterol itself may induce prolongation of the 
QTc-interval. Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from high 
doses of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists. Concomitant treatment of 
beta2-adrenoceptor agonists with drugs which can induce 
hypokalaemia or potentiate a hypokalaemic effect, e.g. 
xanthinederivatives, steroids and diuretics, may add to a possible 
hypokalaemic effect of the beta2-adrenoceptor agonist. Particular

caution is recommended in unstable asthma with variable use of 
rescue bronchodilators, in acute severe asthma as the associated risk 
may be augmented by hypoxia and in other conditions when the 
likelihood for hypokalaemia is increased. It is recommended that 
serum potassium levels are monitored during these circumstances. 
Section 4.5, interactions with other medicinal products and other forms 
of interactions, SmPC: 
Concomitant treatment with quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, 
phenothiazines, antihistamines (terfenadine), monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants can prolong the QTc-interval 
and increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. In addition L-Dopa, 
L-thyroxine, oxytocin and alcohol can impair cardiac tolerance towards 
beta2-sympathomimetics. There is an elevated risk of arrhythmias in 
patients receiving concomitant anaesthesia with halogenated 
hydrocarbons. Hypokalaemia may increase the disposition towards 
arrhythmias in patients who are treated with digitalis glycosides. 
Prescription-only medicine 
Section 4.4, special warnings and precautions for use, SmPC: 
None 
If patients find the treatment ineffective, or exceed the highest 
recommended dose of Budesonide / Formoterol Spiromax®, medical 
attention must be sought (see section 4.2). Sudden and progressive 
deterioration in control of asthma or COPD is potentially life 
threatening and the patient should undergo urgent medical 
assessment. In this situation, consideration should be given to the 
need for increased therapy with corticosteroids, e.g. a course of oral 
corticosteroids, or antibiotic treatment if an infection is present. 
Patients should not be initiated on Budesonide / Formoterol 
Spiromax® during an exacerbation, or if they have significantly 
worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. Serious asthma-related 
adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with 
Budesonide / Formoterol Spiromax®. Patients should be asked to 
continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms 
remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation with Budesonide / 
Formoterol Spiromax®.

Hypokalaemia 
Section 4.4, special warnings and precautions for use, SmPC: 
None 
A fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate should be administered with caution in patients with 
untreated hypokalaemia. 
Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from high doses of 
beta2-adrenoceptor agonists. Concomitant treatment of 
beta2-adrenoceptor agonists with medicinal products which can induce 
hypokalaemia or potentiate a hypokalaemic effect, e.g. 
xanthine-derivatives, steroids and diuretics, may add to a possible 
hypokalaemic effect of the beta2- adrenoceptor agonist. 
Particular caution is recommended in unstable asthma with variable

Pharmacokinetic interactions: 
Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg. ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone 
and HIV protease inhibitors) are likely to markedly increase plasma 
levels of budesonide and concomitant use should be avoided. If this is 
not possible the time interval between administration of the inhibitor 
and budesonide should be as long as possible (see section 4.4). In 
patients using potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, a fixed-dose combination of 
budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate maintenance and 
reliever therapy is not recommended. The potent CYP3A4 inhibitor 
ketoconazole, 200 mg once daily, increased plasma levels of 
concomitantly orally administered budesonide (single dose 3 mg) on 
average six-fold. When ketoconazole was administered 12 hours after 
budesonide the concentration was on average increased only threefold 
showing that separation of the administration times can reduce the 
increase in plasma levels. Limited data about this interaction for 
high-dose inhaled budesonide indicates that marked increases in 
plasma levels (on average four fold) may occur if itraconazole, 200 mg 
once daily, is administered concomitantly with inhaled budesonide 
(single dose of 1000 micrograms). 
Use in pregnant or 
breast feeding 
women 
Pharmacodynamic interactions: 
β -adrenergic blockers can weaken or inhibit the effect of formoterol. A 
fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate 
dehydrate should therefore not be given together with β - adrenergic 
blockers (including eye drops) unless there are compelling reasons. 
Pregnancy 
None 
For a fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate or the concomitant treatment with formoterol and 
budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. 
Data from an embryo-fetal development study in the rat, showed no 
evidence of any additional effect from the combination.  
There are no adequate data from use of formoterol in pregnant women. 
In animal studies formoterol has caused adverse reactions in 
reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels (see section 
5.3). 
Data on approximately 2000 exposed pregnancies indicate no 
increased teratogenic risk associated with the use of inhaled 
budesonide. In animal studies glucocorticosteroids have been shown to 
induce malformations (see section 5.3). This is not likely to be relevant 
for humans given recommended doses. 
Animal studies have also identified an involvement of excess prenatal 
glucocorticoids in increased risks for intrauterine growth retardation, 
adult cardiovascular disease and permanent changes in glucocorticoid 
receptor density, neurotransmitter turnover and behaviour at 
exposures below the teratogenic dose range.

During pregnancy, a fixed-dose combination of budesonide and

outweigh the potential risks. The lowest effective dose of budesonide 
needed to maintain adequate asthma control should be used. 
Breast-feeding 
Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses 
no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether 
formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of 
formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of a 
fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered 
if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Clinical studies in adults have shown that the addition of formoterol to budesonide improved asthma 
symptoms and lung function, and reduced exacerbations. Budesonide/formoterol has demonstrated 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in severe exacerbations as well as rapid and 
effective relief of bronchoconstriction similar to salbutamol and formoterol.  
The two pivotal pharmacokinetic studies with the high strength (320/9 µg per dose) and the middle 
strength (160/4.5 µg per dose) products demonstrated equivalence between BF Spiromax and Symbicort 
Turbohaler for all comparisons both with and without a charcoal blockade. This fixed-dose combination 
product is expected to have the same benefits as the reference product (Symbicort Turbohaler) in 
improving lung function and relieving symptoms in patients with asthma when used in line with the 
approved indication and posology of the reference product. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The pharmacokinetic equivalence of the high-dose and the medium-dose has been conclusively shown.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The high dose and the medium dose of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. have been shown to be 
equivalent to the reference product. Hence their unfavourable effects are expected to be similar to the 
well-known safety profile of the reference product (Symbicort Turbohaler) when used in line with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/707217/2014 
Page 63/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approved indication and posology of the reference product. This is supported also by equivalence shown 
in the study of extra-pulmonary pharmacodynamic effects, including effects on QT interval. 
A risk of “off-label” use in children and adolescents exists and has been addressed in Product Information. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
For the high and middle dose of BF Spiromax (strengths applied for in this submission) it is not expected 
that the unfavourable effects will differ from those of the reference product. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. will be an alternative to high dose and medium dose Symbicort 
Turbohaler available for doctors and patients. However the low dose (80/4.5 micrograms per dose) is not 
available. This brings in the risk of lack of alternative for down-ward titration of dose when required. The 
lack of evidence of equivalence in adolescents and children and the non-availability of a lower strength 
product precludes the use of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. in these populations. The risk of 
“off-label” use in children and adolescents has been addressed by the inclusion of the statements in 
sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC regarding the use of the product by adults 18 years of age and older only 
and by appropriate labelling.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The high dose and the medium dose of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. have been shown to be 
equivalent in adults to the reference product Symbicort Turbohaler.  
The benefit of development of an alternative to the reference product which increases treatment options 
for patients and doctors is outweighed by the potential risks due to the unknowns described above. The 
CHMP acknowledges that there is a lack of significant safety concerns when this product is used in adults, 
18 years of age and older. In respect of the high strength (320/9 µg per dose) and the middle strength 
(160/4.5 µg per dose), equivalence between BF Spiromax and Symbicort Turbohaler has been 
demonstrated and therefore the benefit/risk balance for these strengths is considered positive. 
The doses and dose regimens stated for these orally inhaled fixed-dose combination products for use in 
adults are acceptable.  
The proposal not to seek an indication for use in children and adolescents is in line with the current data. 
The risk of “off-label” use in these populations has been addressed by the inclusion of the statements in 
sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC regarding the use of the product by adults 18 years of age and older only 
and by appropriate product labelling. 
The CHMP recommends development of a lower strength of this new fixed-dose combination (80/4.5 
micrograms per dose, inhalation powder) in line with the reference product, Symbicort Turbohaler and 
the development of this lower strength for use in children and adolescents.  Therapeutic equivalence in 
respect of both efficacy and safety and an appropriate benefit/risk balance must be demonstrated in these 
age groups. 
The applicant is strongly encouraged to carry through the proposed development of these products in 
children and adolescents as soon as possible. The applicant is also encouraged to complete the 
development of the low strength product for use in both adults and children.

4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. in the treatment of asthma, where 
use of a combination (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 adrenoceptor agonist) is appropriate (in 
patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled short-acting β2 
adrenoceptor agonists, or in patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroids and 
long-acting β2 adrenoceptor agonists), is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription  
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in 
accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for 
under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same time.

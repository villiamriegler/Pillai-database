Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Idacio (adalimumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Idacio. The RMP details important 
risks of Idacio, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Idacio's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Idacio's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Idacio should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Idacio  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Idacio's 
RMP.

II. 
Risks  Associated  with  the  Medicine  and  Activities  to 
Minimize or Further Characterize the Risks 
Important  risks  of  Idacio,  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Idacio’s risks, are outlined below.  
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
 The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
 The  medicine’s  legal  status  -  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (e.g.  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In  the  case  of  Idacio,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimization
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Idacio is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important  risks  of  Idacio  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Idacio.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the 
medicine 
Idacio  is  a  biosimilar  medicine  to  the  reference  product  Humira®. 
Malignancies  has  been  classified  as  an  identified  risk  for  Idacio  in 
accordance with the reference product. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
A prospective observational cohort study of 19,486 patients with IBD, 
including  7,727  patients  with  UC  or  unclassified  IBD,  found  an 
increased  risk  for  developing  lymphoproliferative  disorders  among 
patients receiving thiopurines compared to patients who had never 
received  these  drugs  (hazard  ratio:  5.28;  95%  CI:  2.01  -  13.9) 
(Beaugerie 2009).  
Past and concomitant thiopurine therapy appears to contribute to the 
risk in patients with IBD. Other risks may or may not be applicable to 
HSTCL which is rare (Kotlyar 2011, Parakkal 2011). Risk factors for 
leukemia  depend  on  the  type  of  leukemia.  In  general,  factors 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  leukemia  include  smoking, 
exposure  to  certain  chemicals  such  as  benzene,  exposure  to 
radiation,  past  treatment  with  chemotherapy  or  radiation  therapy, 
having  certain  inherited  or  genetic  disorders,  having  certain  blood 
disorders, and having a family history of leukemia (National Cancer 
Institute 2014). 
Factors  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  skin  cancer  include 
radiation (e.g., sunlight, tanning, therapy), personal or family history 
of  melanoma,  fair  skin,  certain  drugs  (e.g.,  antibiotics,  hormones, 
[Peyrin-Biroulet  2011]),  medical 
antidepressants, 
conditions or drugs that suppress the immune system, damaged skin 
(old scars, burns, ulcers, or areas of inflammation), and exposure to 
arsenic (National Cancer Institute 2011b). Additional risk factors that 
increase  squamous  cell  cancer  risk  are  human  papilloma  virus 
infection and actinic keratosis (National Cancer Institute 2011b). 
thiopurines 
Factors associated with an increased risk of melanoma include UV 
radiation  (e.g.,  sunlight,  tanning),  personal  history  of  melanoma, 
family history of melanoma, fair skin, certain drugs (e.g., antibiotics, 
hormones,  antidepressants),  medical  conditions  that  suppress  the 
immune system or are treated with drugs that suppress the immune 
system, dysplastic nevus, and having many common moles (National 
Cancer Institute 2011b). Factors associated with an increased risk of 
MCC  include  advanced  age,  immunosuppression  (e.g.,  organ 
transplant,  HIV),  other  cancers  (e.g.,  squamous  cell  carcinoma, 
basal  cell  carcinoma,  Bowen  disease,  internal  malignancies  and 
haematological neoplasias) and UV light exposure (Becker 2010a). 
Risk minimization measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
Text in SmPC:

Section  4.8:  Information  on  incidence  rates  from  clinical  trials  in 
lymphoma,  NMSC,  and  melanoma.  Information  on  incidence  rates 
from postmarketing surveillance in HSTCL, leukaemia, and MCC. 
The SmPC also highlights that some of the cases of HSTCL occurred 
with  concomitant  use  of  AZA  or  6-MP,  and  that  the  potential  risk 
combination  of  AZA  or  6-MP  and  Idacio  should  be  carefully 
considered. 
In order to inform patients of these risks, corresponding text is also 
present in the package leaflet.

Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Idacio  is  a  biosimilar  medicine  to  the  reference  product  Humira®. 
Demyelinating disorders (including multiple sclerosis [MS], Guillain-
Barre syndrome [GBS] and optic neuritis [ON]) has been classified 
as  an  identified  risk  for  Idacio  in  accordance  with  the  reference 
product. 
Factors  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  MS  include  genetic 
predisposition (e.g., HLA-DR2 [HLA-DRB1*15], ethnic origin [being 
white], female sex, Epstein-Barr infection, smoking, latitude/vitamin 
D, and early exposure to environmental risk factors) (Ramagopalan 
2010).  Factors  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  GBS  include 
male  sex,  Campylobacter  jejuni  infection,  some  vaccines,  and 
increased age (Sejvar 2011). Subjects with intermediate uveitis have 
a  high  prevalence  of  demyelination  (Burkholder  2012,  Zein  2004,

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
PML  occurs  predominantly  among  severely  immunosuppressed 
patients.  A  descriptive  analysis  of  PML  cases  identified  through 
claims  found  approximately  40%  of  patients  were  aged  40  to  49 
years and 75% were male (Eng 2006). Currently, over 80% of PML 
cases are diagnosed in patients with HIV/AIDS (Weber 2008). Prior 
to the era of HIV and AIDS, more than 60% of PML cases were seen 
in  patients  with  lymphoproliferative  disorders,  with  the  highest 
incidence  reported  in  patients  with  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia 
(Carson  2009).  Other  immunosuppressive  conditions  that  put 
patients  at  risk  of  developing  PML  include  malignancies,  organ 
transplants,  systemic 
lupus  erythematosus  (SLE)  and  other 
rheumatic diseases (Eng 2006, Carson 2009, Calabrese 2007, Bartt

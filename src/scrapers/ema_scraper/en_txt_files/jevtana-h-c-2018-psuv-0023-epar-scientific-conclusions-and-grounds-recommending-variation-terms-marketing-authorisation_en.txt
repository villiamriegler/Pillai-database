Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Jevtana, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
The MAH performed a safety review of anemia as requested by the PRAC following the assessment of 
the last PSUR (PSUR 6). Of the 254 cases with associated anemia events, 130 cases recovered from 
181  events;  24  cases  were  recovering  from  31  events;  13  cases  recovered  from  19  events  with 
sequelae;  1  case  stabilized  with  1  event  of  anemia;  31  cases  did  not  recover  from  39  events.  38 
cases  had  an  unknown  outcome  with  69  events.  There  were  18  cases  with  a  fatal  outcome  and 
associated with 23 anemia pertaining events. 
From  this  review,  it  appears  that  the  occurrence  of  anemia  is  not  confounded  by  concomitant 
treatments which could cause this adverse event. Therefore cabazitaxel appears to be causing those 
anemia events. 
As a consequence the MAH has proposed with this PSUR to update section 4.4 of the SmPC to amend 
the current warning on the risk of anemia in patients treated with cabazitaxel in order to include that 
haemoglobin and haematocrit should be checked before treatment and in case of anemia symptoms 
or blood loss. This update to the cabazitaxel product information was supported by the PRAC. 
Therefore,  in  view  of  available  data  regarding  anaemia,  the  PRAC  considered  that  changes  to  the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Jevtana, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance cabazitxel is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

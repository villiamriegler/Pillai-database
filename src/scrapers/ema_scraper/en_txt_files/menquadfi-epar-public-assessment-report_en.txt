2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The assessed product is an intended vaccine to prevent meningococcal disease by triggering the production 
of serum bactericidal antibodies against the capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, 
C, Y, and W. The proposed therapeutic indication is as follows: 
“MenQuadfi is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older, against 
invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y.  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with available official recommendations.” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and prevention 
Meningococci (Neisseria meningitidis) are transmittable bacteria with a high incidence to induce 
meningococcal disease in humans. Their virulence is mostly based on the biochemical structure of capsular 
polysaccharides. So far 12 distinct meningococcal serogroups have been classified, with serogroups A, B, C, 
W, X and Y being responsible for most cases of meningococcal disease. Dynamics of meningococcal 
transmission, acquisition, and carriage in humans are a major influence on the incidence and likelihood of 
meningococcal disease. However, the worldwide incidences of meningococcal disease vary greatly among 
regions. The European population is mostly affected by serogroup B, but also C and Y are responsible for 
some of the reported cases (Peterson et al. 2019). The presently best-known prevention against 
meningococcal disease is the up-front immunization with vaccines targeting the relevant serogroups. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features Aetiology  
The natural habitat and reservoir of meningococci are the upper respiratory nasopharyngeal mucosal 
membranes. N. meningitidis is a common commensal, carried by approximately 8% to 20% of the normal 
population, but the prevalence of carriage varies widely and does not directly predict meningococcal disease. 
However, any impact on meningococcal carriage will also have an impact on the incidence of meningococcal 
disease. The rates of meningococcal disease are influenced by factors that enhance exposure and 
transmission, carriage rates of strains with different virulence potential, and host factors. Transmission is by 
direct contact with or inhalation of meningococcus in large droplet nuclei that are acquired through close 
contact with respiratory secretions and saliva. However, acquisition can be transient, induce meningococcal 
disease or lead to colonialization and carriage. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
During the course of meningococcal infection, a meningitis and sepsis can develop, both being potentially 
lethal. Thus, the untreated mortality rate of meningococcal disease is high and the pathogenesis is not 
completely understood. Additionally, survivors of the disease often suffer from severe neurological, visual or 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 11/121 
 
  
  
  
hearing impairments (Peterson et al. 2019). The best-known method for prevention of the disease is the 
immunization against disease-causing serogroups. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The most important host-dependent factor is the presence of serum bactericidal antibodies that neutralize the 
organism by complement-mediated bacteriolysis. Anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies protect against 
meningococcal disease via complement mediated bactericidal activity.  
Meningococcal vaccines induce the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular 
polysaccharides of N. meningitidis serogroups. MenACYW conjugate vaccine is intended to induce antibody 
production specific for the capsular polysaccharides of N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y, and W. In multiple 
European countries meningococcal C (MenC) vaccination is recommended for toddlers, even though the 
favoured timing of vaccination differs among countries. Additionally, two quadrivalent MenACWY vaccinations 
are available in Europe: Nimenrix, licensed in the EU since 20/04/2012 and indicated for the immunization 
from the age of 6 weeks, as well as Menveo, licensed in the EU since 15/03/2010 and indicated for the 
immunization of children from 2 years of age, adolescents and adults.  
Menveo is also available in the US but not Nimenrix. In addition, other MenACWY vaccinations are available in 
the US: Menactra is approved from infants as young as 9 months of age to adults 55 years of age, and 
Menomune-A/C/Y/W-135, a polysaccharide vaccine, which was licensed for persons 2 years of age and older 
at the time of the clinical trials. The production was discontinued in 2017 by the applicant (MAH of 
Menomune). According to the applicant, the decision was strategic and not based on any quality, safety, or 
efficacy issues.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) is presented as a 0.5 mL solution for injection containing as active substance (AS) 
10 µg each of serogroups A, C, W (also referred to as W135) and Y meningococcal polysaccharide (PS), 
individually conjugated to 55 µg tetanus toxoid carrier.  
Other ingredients are: sodium chloride, sodium acetate and water for injection. 
The conjugate vaccine FP is available in a 2 mL Type I borosilicate clear glass vial with a 13 mm chlorobutyl 
stopper and a flip off seal. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The N. meningitidis Polysaccharide (Groups A, C, Y and W135) Conjugate Vaccine contains four active 
substances comprised of serogroup-specific polysaccharide antigens purified from Neisseria meningitidis 
Serogroups A, C, Y, and W135, separately conjugated to tetanus toxoid. 
The meningococcal polysaccharide components were originally EU-authorised as the active substances 
Menomune A, Men – C, Men A/C and Menomune A/C/Y/W135 and are the same as those used in the 
manufacture of the meningococcal (serogroups A, C, Y, and W135) polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid 
conjugate vaccine (Menactra). The tetanus toxoid protein component used to prepare the polysaccharide-
protein monovalent conjugates is the same as that used as a carrier in the EU authorised Haemophilus 
influenzae type b tetanus protein conjugate vaccine (ActHIB). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Sanofi Pasteur, 1541 Avenue Marcel Mérieux, 69280 Marcy l’Etoile, France is responsible for manufacture of 
the tetanus toxoid carrier protein (concentrated tetanus protein intermediate). 
Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. Discovery Drive Swiftwater, PA 18370-0187 USA is responsible for manufacture of the AS 
intermediate (N. meningitidis polysaccharide purified bulk powder) and AS (N. meningitidis polysaccharide 
tetanus toxoid conjugate concentrate, serogroup A, C, Y, and W). Approved contract testing facilities are also 
specified. Appropriate GMP certificates/ authorisations are available for all sites. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Manufacture of polysaccharide bulk powder 
Neisseria meningitidis working seed banks (WSBs) of the respective serogroups (Groups A, C, Y and W135) 
are individually propagated and fermentation is upscaled in fermenters. The fermentation broth is harvested 
and inactivated using phenol. The inactivated broth is concentrated. After precipitation the diluted filtrate is 
concentrated and treated with enzymes to remove nucleic acids and proteins, extracted with phenol, 
precipitated and dried to yield the AS intermediates, N. meningitidis Polysaccharide Purified Bulk Powders 
(Groups A, C, Y and W135). In process controls during fermentation are considered appropriate. There are no 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 13/121 
 
  
  
  
reprocessing steps for N. meningitidis polysaccharide purified bulk powder, serogroup production process. 
The AS intermediate, N. meningitidis polysaccharide purified bulk powder is filled into bottles and stored.  
Manufacture of tetanus toxoid (TT) 
Inoculated working seed lot (WSL) is cultivated, fermented and upscaled. After cell lysis and harvest, the 
toxin is diafiltered and concentrated. Precipitation is followed by dialysis and filtration. The purified tetanus 
toxin is then inactivated. The purified tetanus toxoid, referred to as purified tetanus protein (PTP), is further 
concentrated and purified, yielding the concentrated tetanus protein (CTP). CTP is filtered, Sanofi Pasteur 
Inc., Swiftwater, PA, USA for storage. Once it is received at Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Swiftwater, PA, USA, it is 
referred to as tetanus toxoid, purified. 
For serogroups C, Y and W135, a concentration step is additionally performed on the tetanus toxoid, purified 
prior to filtration until used for conjugation.   For serogroup A, the tetanus toxoid protein is filtered into bags.  
In process controls during the PTP and CTP, purified manufacturing process are suitably documented. There 
are no established reprocessing procedures for concentrated tetanus protein or tetanus toxoid, filtered 
concentrate. Hold times proposed throughout the AS manufacturing process are considered acceptable based 
on the information provided. 
Manufacture of conjugate 
Serogroup A purified bulk powder is activated and derivatised using a linker. Serogroup C, Y and W purified 
bulk powder is depolymerised and activated. Depolymerised and activated bulk powder is purified and may 
be stored under defined conditions before conjugation. After diafiltration and purification, the active 
substance is 0.2 μm filtered into bioprocess bags stored. Shelf life and storage conditions have been 
proposed for the AS and found acceptable. In-process controls are suitably defined. In the event a breach or 
integrity failure is observed from the beginning of the conjugate filtration process until the completion of 
dispense process, one refiltration of the conjugate is permitted. Details of the refiltration process are suitably 
defined. 
Control of materials 
The bacterial seed bank system consists of a N. meningitidis pre-master seed, animal component free master 
seed and animal component free working seed for each serogroup. Preparation of the seed banks and 
associated in-process controls are defined. All the seed banks are stored at ≤ 60°C. 
The seed lot system for Clostridium tetani consists of a master seed bank and an intermediate seed bank. 
From the intermediate seed bank, new working cell banks are established. The same seed bank system was 
assessed for the company’s Haemophilus type B conjugated polysaccharide vaccine licensed in several EU 
member states (Act-HIB). The approach adopted to monitor the stability of WSL for C. tetani and WSBs for N. 
meningitidis Serogroups A, C, Y and W135 is considered acceptable. A protocol for establishment of future 
WSLs/WSBs has been provided. 
The applicant provides a detailed list of the control of raw materials, of prepared solvents, reagents, media 
and buffer material, water for manufacturing and gases used in the manufacturing process of the ASs. Raw 
materials are divided into pharmacopoeial grade components (Ph. Eur. or USP) and non-pharmacopoeial 
grade components. The specifications for the non-pharmacopoeial grade materials are provided in sufficient 
detail. The internal specifications are well defined and are acceptable for the intended use of the material. 
Materials of ruminant origin used in the production of concentrated purified tetanus protein bulk comply with 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 14/121 
 
  
  
  
Ph. Eur. 1483 and 5.2.8 with respect to transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) safety (see 
adventitious agents’ section). 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
During the manufacture of the active substances, critical process parameters (CPPs), in-process controls and 
release tests have been implemented to ensure that the manufacturing process steps remain under control 
and meet their established operating range and specifications. Ranges of critical process parameters during 
the manufacturing process of the active substances and its intermediates have been verified by small scale 
studies and are considered adequate. The control strategy has been adequately explained.  
Purified bulk powder 
Specifications and batch analysis data have been provided for the purified bulk powder and the 
activated/derivatised (serogroup A) and depolymerised/activated (serogroup C, Y, W135) polysaccharide 
intermediates. Critical steps for the manufacturing of the purified bulk powder are accurately defined and 
controlled. 
A stability study was conducted using three batches of purified bulk polysaccharide powder of each 
serogroup. The outcome of the study justifies the established hold time of this intermediate. The dried 
powder was tested for molecular size, phosphorous content, O-acetyl content, identity, bacterial endotoxin, 
nucleic acids content, protein content and moisture.  
Batch analysis data shows that the activated/derivatised and depolymerised/activated polysaccharide 
intermediates are manufactured consistently. Phase III batches, manufactured in building 46 of Swiftwater, 
PA, USA site, used in clinical studies have been compared to batches manufactured in building 56 of 
Swiftwater, PA, USA site showing consistency of critical quality attributes (CQAs) throughout clinical 
development. 
A hold study was performed to support the storage conditions and hold time of activated polysaccharides. 
Tested parameters were total and free linker, reducing activity and bioburden. 
Tetanus toxoid 
The intermediates involved in the manufacture of the tetanus component of the AS are the: purified tetanus 
protein (PTP); concentrated tetanus protein (CTP) and tetanus toxoid, filtered concentrate. Each intermediate 
can be stored. Each intermediate, except the tetanus toxoid, filtered concentrate, is analysed by quality 
control release tests and must be in compliance with its specification. Batch analyses data are provided. 
Release tests for the PTP include protein/total nitrogen content and ratio, OD280/OD260 ratio, flocculating 
titre, antigenic purity, molecular size distribution and sterility. Release tests performed on the CTP are protein 
nitrogen content, OD280/OD260 ratio, phosphorous limit test, residual free formaldehyde, flocculation titre, 
antigenic purity, molecular size distribution, sterility, endotoxin and absence of toxin/irreversibility of toxoid.  
CPPs and their ranges for PTP and for the CTP have been evaluated and accurately defined. Batch analyses 
have been performed on the three intermediate levels (PTP, CTP, TT filtered concentrate), showing the 
consistency of the manufacturing process. Stability data provided justify claimed hold time.  
Process validation 
Purified Tetanus Protein (PTP): The validation of the PTP production was divided into the validation of the 
Clostridium tetani fermentation process and harvest/purification /detoxification steps of the concentrated 
tetanus toxin to obtain the PTP. All CPPs, in-process control testing and quality control acceptance criteria 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 15/121 
 
  
  
  
were met. In conclusion, the manufacturing process for the purified tetanus protein is validated, from the 
inoculum preparation to the detoxification stage. 
Concentrated Tetanus Protein (CTP): The CPP and the quality control testing for concentrated tetanus protein 
batches were met. The manufacturing process for the concentration steps of the PTP to obtain the CTP is 
validated. Shipping validation of the CTP is provided. 
Tetanus Toxoid, Filtered Concentrate: By evaluating the CQAs, the study validated the consistency of the AS 
intermediate, tetanus toxoid, filtered concentrate manufacturing process. In addition, a study was performed 
to establish the hold time for the tetanus toxoid filtered, concentrate stored at 1 °C to 5 °C in bags prior to 
conjugation. All validation data showed conformity to the acceptance criteria. The tetanus toxoid, filtered 
concentrate process consistently produced an AS intermediate that meets the critical quality attributes thus 
demonstrating suitability for use in the conjugation process.  
N. meningitidis polysaccharide purified bulk powders (serogroups A, C, Y, W135): During process validation, 
the critical process parameters and critical quality attributes were evaluated. Results for all three 
validation/consistency lots met pre-defined acceptance criteria. These results demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process for the AS intermediates, N. meningitidis polysaccharide purified bulk powders 
(serogroups A, C, Y, W135), consistently produced a product that meets all the specifications and quality 
characteristics.  
N. meningitidis polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate concentrates serogroups (A, C, Y and W135): The 
manufacturing processes for the ASs are comprised of both common unit operations and serogroup-related 
specificities. The validation studies supporting unit operations and performed with batches produced in 
Building 46 (B46) are presented. The unit operation validation studies include: mixing studies, column 
chromatography studies, filtration (& re-filtration under specified conditions) validation, hold-time studies and 
column re-use studies.   
The manufacturing process for the ASs, N. meningitidis polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate concentrates 
(serogroups A, C, Y, W135), was initially developed and validated in the B46 production facility. After the 
production of process validation/clinical consistency batches, the AS manufacturing was transferred to the 
production facility in Building 56 (B56) for commercial manufacturing. Three comparability batches were 
manufactured in B56 and the data collected was assessed against the same validation criteria as batches 
manufactured in B46. 
The process consistency and comparability validation studies performed using six batches of the AS of each 
serogroup are provided: 3 consecutive, full-scale validation and consistency batches manufactured in B46, 
and 3 consecutive, full-scale comparability batches manufactured in B56.  
Manufacturing process development 
Changes during the manufacturing process from Phase I have been described extensively and the impact of 
changes have been assessed by comparing consistency lots of every different serogroup to historical data. All 
acceptance criteria were met for all batches.  
The major changes in the manufacturing process between production of AS (conjugate concentrates) clinical 
Phase I lots and Phase III comparability lots include increase in batch size of PTP and change in the seed lot 
system. The comparability exercise is considered acceptable. There were no changes in the manufacturing 
process of N. meningitidis polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate concentrate, serogroup A, C, Y and W135, 
between Phase III clinical consistency/process validation and comparability lots produced at manufacturing 
scale. 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 16/121 
 
  
  
  
Characterisation 
For the characterization of the purified polysaccharide bulk powder, 1D proton nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) spectroscopy and high-performance size exclusion chromatography with multi angle laser light 
scattering (HPSEC-MALS) testing have been performed. For characterization of TT carrier protein 
intermediates, differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) for PTT, PTP and CTP intermediates was performed. 
Characterization studies confirm chemical and structural attributes of intermediates. 
The concentration of process residuals was measured in the active substance and the concentration in the 
finished product was calculated. Process residuals have been assessed in the AS and FP. All parameters were 
below the acceptance criteria. The extent and results of the study justifies the absence of routine testing of 
the identified process residuals. Batches tested for impurities are representative of clinical material. 
Regarding product-related impurities, degradation impurities confirm the efficiency of the conjugation process 
over time. The concentration of free polysaccharide and free protein are considered as stability indicating and 
provide information about degradation of the active substance. Free polysaccharide and free protein assays 
are performed on each batch of the AS during stability. 
Specification 
The AS release specifications for each serogroup conjugate include appropriate physicochemical tests and 
tests for identity, protein content, polysaccharide content, polysaccharide to protein ratio, molecular size 
distribution, free polysaccharide content, free protein content, O-acetyl, endotoxin and bioburden test.  
The release specifications for free protein will be reassessed once an adequate number of batches are tested 
and the results are analysed (see recommendation 1). The specifications have been justified in accordance 
with ICH Q6B. 
The release specifications of the active substances were requested to include specifications for appearance. 
The applicant will evaluate the need for the test for routine operation after a minimum of 30 active substance 
batches from each serogroup (see recommendation 3). This is considered acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
The extent of validation of the analytical methods, with some exceptions, corresponds to ICH Q2 (R1) and 
the respective chapters of Ph. Eur. The analytical procedures are considered appropriate for the intended 
purpose.  
Batch analysis 
Active substance phase III clinical consistency/process validation batches and comparability batches of every 
serogroup were tested. Analytical procedures and specifications were the same as for release testing. 
The results of all batches are within the acceptance criteria. No apparent trend or shift in analytical results 
between validation lots and comparability lots has been identified. Batch to batch consistency has been 
demonstrated for the validation lots, and comparability lots. It is concluded that the batches were 
manufactured consistently and according to pre- defined quality standards, and that the production process 
has been successfully transferred to the site intended for commercial production. 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Reference materials 
The applicant stated that no reference standard is used for the ASs. For the purified tetanus protein and 
concentrated tetanus protein, the reference material is an in-house flocculating standard for tetanus 
(antitoxin) calibrated against the international flocculation standard for tetanus (NIBSC) and stored at 2 °C to 
8 °C. Polysaccharide concentrates are used to demonstrate the serogroup identity and specificity, and also 
that purified polysaccharide powders do not contain other serogroups. 
During the procedure, the applicant was requested to provide information on all internal reference materials 
used in the control testing at any stage of product manufacture, including information on the type of 
reference, preparation instructions, storage conditions and shelf life of the different reference standards and 
materials. The applicant has now satisfactorily provided the requested information on the in-house reference 
materials used and the process for qualification of new reference lots is described. 
Container Closure System 
The container closure system for the ASs, N. meningitidis polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate 
concentrate, Group A, C, Y and W135 is a bioprocess bag. Compliance with the Ph.Eur. requirements for the 
container closure system has been demonstrated. Comprehensive extractable and leachable studies have 
been performed, the results of which are acceptable. 
Stability 
The stability testing program presented by the applicant is considered to be appropriate and in accordance 
with ICH. Stability studies have been performed on the same phase III clinical consistency/process validation 
batches and comparability batches used for batch analysis. An accelerated study has been completed. A real 
time study is ongoing and the applicant commits to complete the stability testing for all ongoing studies 
according to the presented stability protocol. 
The analytical procedures chosen for the program are suitably stability-indicating for the active substance. 
The containers used for the study conforms to the ones used in the manufacturing process. Tests are 
scheduled at appropriate time points. 
The data presented shows that all results generated so far met the pre- set specifications and no apparent 
trend could be observed in the real time stability study. Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or 
significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. Shelf-life and storage conditions 
for the active substance have been proposed by the applicant and found acceptable.

* Tetanus toxoid quantity is approximate and dependent on the polysaccharide to protein ratio for the 
conjugates used in each formulation. 
Different polysaccharide contents were used during Phase I studies: 2 µg, 4 µg and 10 µg per polysaccharide 
per dose, as well as 10 µg of polysaccharide for serogroups A and W135 and 4 µg of polysaccharide for 
serogroups C and Y. The Phase II clinical batches were manufactured with the final formulation of 10 μg 
polysaccharide per serogroup per dose. The Phase IIb and Phase III clinical batches utilised a manufacturing 
process that was scaled up. There are no differences in the formulation between the Phase IIb / Phase III 
clinical batches and the final formulation. Manufacturing was transferred to the site of commercial production 
during phase III. Phase III and commercial batches of the finished product are formulated/filled at Sanofi 
Pasteur site in Swiftwater, PA, USA. Comparability between the batches throughout Phase I to Phase III 
manufacturing process has been shown. 
Comparability was demonstrated showing that the final container vaccine manufactured using the Phase I 
through Phase III processes are comparable based on the critical quality attributes. 
In accordance with the Ph.Eur. monograph for meningococcal conjugated vaccines (07/2019:3066), the 
production method is required to be validated in order to demonstrate that the product, if tested, would 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 19/121 
 
  
  
  
comply with the test for pyrogens (Ph.Eur. 2.6.8). Sufficient justification regarding the pyrogenicity of the 
product was provided by the applicant during the procedure. 
The vaccine is filled in 2 ml glass vials, closed with an appropriate stopper and a flip-off seal. For phase I and 
phase II, 3 ml glass vials were used. The suitability of the container closure system has been demonstrated 
by extractables, leachables, cytotoxicity and stability studies. The container-closure system complies with Ph. 
Eur. requirements. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Meningococcal polysaccharide (serogroups A, C, Y, and W135) tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine, is 
manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Discovery Drive, Swiftwater, PA 18370, USA. The site for EU batch 
release is Sanofi Pasteur, Industrial Park Incarville, 27100 Val de Reuil, France. Appropriate GMP certification 
for these sites has been provided.  
Each monovalent conjugate is thawed. Sodium acetate buffer, conjugates and sodium chloride buffer are 
mixed. Following 0.22 µm filtration, the mixture is transferred to portable tanks. Sodium chloride buffer is 
added to the final volume through the 0.22 µm filter. The portable tank is stored at 1 ºC to 5 ºC for up to 6 
months.  
Prior to filling, the contents of the portable container are mixed and then 0.22 µm filtered. 2 ml vials are 
rinsed with WFI and depyrogenated before filling.  
The 0.22 µm filtration of the bulk from the portable tanks prior to filling is considered a critical process step. 
Therefore, bioburden is measured before filtration. Pre-filtration bioburden is also measured before filling in 
the 2 ml vials. Weight check is performed in order to control the filling volume. Final containers are 100% 
visually examined according to USP. There is no pooling of AS batches in the preparation of one FP lot. 
Comprehensive studies have been performed for the validation of the formulation and filling process, at two 
different scales. All CPPs and CQAs have been defined and assessed, on a total of seven lots for the small-
scale process and four lots for the large scale process.  
Studies were conducted on the formulation tank and portable tanks to validate mixing. The measurements of 
all time points of all tanks met the pre-set criteria. 
The lots were assessed against validation acceptance criteria which consisted of the established process 
parameters, in-process controls and CQAs for the filling validation. Routine testing for the FP was conducted. 
Additional non-routine samples were taken across the fill to evaluate the total and % free polysaccharide, 
total protein and pH. 
A summary of the non-critical controlled and/or monitored process parameters for the FP manufacturing 
process including a clarification of the classification exercise was requested in the list of questions. The 
requested information on non-critical and/or monitored process parameters for finished product has been 
provided and is considered acceptable. Critical process parameters and quality attributes are therefore 
considered well defined and controlled. Appropriate media fill studies and filter validation studies were 
conducted.  
The packaged finished product is shipped from the production facility to the Sanofi distribution centre. A 
summary of the shipping validation study has been provided upon request and is acceptable. 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 20/121 
 
  
  
  
Overall, a detailed description of the manufacturing process for the AS has been presented by the applicant. 
The deviations filed during the process validation studies are extensively explained and considered to have no 
impact on the quality of the studies and still permit a conclusion that the process is under suitable control. 
The production process for the FP is considered to be acceptably validated. 
Product specification 
The FP specifications include appropriate physicochemical tests and tests for identity, purity and potency. The 
panel of product specifications for release of the final lot vaccine comprises tests for identity, total and free 
polysaccharide, total protein, molar mass, appearance, volume, pH, endotoxin, container closure integrity 
and sterility. 
Release specifications for the bulk and final container product have been justified according to ICH Q6B and 
are considered acceptable. The applicant was asked to evaluate the risk of the presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the MenQuadfi finished product in accordance with the published Art. 5(3) Referral on 
Nitrosamines (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-
assessment-report_en.pdf).  A respective risk assessment has now been provided, showing no risk of 
nitrosamine impurities in the FP.  
In conclusion, the program for control of finished product is considered adequate and conforms to the Ph. 
Eur. monographs 3066 Meningococcal group A, C, W135 and Y Conjugate Vaccine as well as 0153 Vaccines 
for Human Use. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The panel of release tests for final lot vaccine comprises tests for 
identity, total and free polysaccharide, total protein, molar mass, appearance, volume, pH, endotoxin, 
container closure integrity and sterility 
Batch analysis 
The final container FP was tested according to the release specifications. All tests passed the acceptance 
criteria. No visible shift or trend could be identified between the phase III clinical batches and the commercial 
batches. Therefore, it is concluded that the manufacturing process of the FP is consistent. 
Reference materials 
The dossier describes relevant reference materials utilized within the test methods and procedures for use.  
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been performed on the bulk formulated and on the filled FP. The extent of the stability 
study program presented by the applicant is seen as adequate and in accordance with ICH guidelines. The 
chosen analytical procedures are stability-indicating and validated accordingly. The studies have been 
performed in the same containers that will be used for commercial batches. 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 21/121 
 
  
  
  
 
 
Stability studies performed at actual storage conditions (2 °C to 8 °C) demonstrate the ability of the 
container closure system to maintain product sterility over the proposed holding period of the formulated 
bulk. Studies for the filled FP included a real time stability study, an accelerated stability study, photostability 
study and a forced degradation study. 
The applicant commits to re-evaluate the end of shelf life specification, as soon as 8 more lots reach the end 
of shelf life at the stability program. The photostability study, conducted according to ICH guideline Q1B, 
shows that exposure to light has no influence on the packaged product. 
A FP shelf life of 42 months at 2-8 °C is agreed. 
Adventitious agents 
The applicant provides a list of materials of animal origin used for establishment of the meningococcal seed 
lot system. For the master seed, no material of biological origin was used. Materials used for the 
establishment of the pre-master seed comply with the requirements of EMEA/410/01. Raw materials of 
ruminant origin are used in the production of Clostridium tetani seed lots (skimmed milk, meat extract, 
casein peptone, L-cysteine) and concentrated purified tetanus protein bulk (casein peptone, tryptone V, beef 
heart infusion, l-tyrosine, peptide N3) and comply with Ph. Eur. 1483 and 5.2.8 with respect to TSE safety. 
The seed lots are tested for purity and the manufacturing process is performed aseptically and includes 
bacterial inactivation during the purification of the bacterial antigens. The finished product is tested for 
sterility. Viral clearance studies for the bacterial vaccine are not required as there is no host available for the 
propagation of virus. Some steps have the potential for the inactivation of viral particles. Therefore, there is a 
low risk for contamination with adventitious agents, which is acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The information provided in section 3 of the CTD is considered acceptable. The applicant gives a detailed 
description of the manufacturing process and process development of all ASs and FP. The production 
processes have been validated satisfactorily, CPPs and CQAs have been identified and implemented 
accordingly. The control strategies for all ASs and FP are considered to be acceptable. Analytical methods are 
considered to be scientifically sound and adequately validated. Consistency of the manufacturing process has 
been demonstrated. 
Three recommendations are proposed see Table in 2.2.6 section.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in 
the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance 
on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development

*REC- recommendation 
variation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
To support MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine clinical development, nonclinical pharmacology studies were 
performed to demonstrate the ability of the vaccine to induce a specific and bactericidal antibody response to 
meningococcal polysaccharide antigens (Serogroups A, C, Y and W). The toxicology programme comprises a 
repeated dose toxicity study in CD rats and a preliminary immunogenicity and DART study in NZW rabbits. 
These studies were conducted to understand the toxicological profile of MenQuadfi, including the potential 
systemic and local effects and the potential risk to women of childbearing potential and their offspring. 
Additionally, immunogenicity examinations were included in all toxicology studies to demonstrate that the 
vaccine induces a specific immune response to the meningococcal polysaccharide antigens contained in 
MenQuadfi. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
It is considered acceptable that nonclinical pharmacology studies are limited to demonstration of 
immunogenic response via SBA assay and IgG response. No nonclinical data on protection against 
meningococcal infection by vaccine candidates (challenge studies) were generated. This is also in line with 
current guidance.  
Mice, rat and rabbit strains were tested for their immunological responses after immunization with tetravalent 
meningococcal polysaccharide (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) conjugate vaccine formulations. The highest and 
most reproducible results were obtained in mice. Thus, different mouse strains were further evaluated to 
select the best fitted mouse model. Highest IgG and SBA titers against all four polysaccharides (serogroup A, 
C, Y and W) were measured in selected strain of mice. Thus, selected strain of mice were determined to 
represent the best model for the planned immunogenicity studies. The selected immunization dose of each 
meningococcal polysaccharide was found suitable for evaluating the immunogenicity of formulations of 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 23/121 
 
  
  
  
 
tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid since it induced an immune response 
against all 4 polysaccharides with titers in the middle of the dose response curve. 
For the selection of the appropriate immunization schedule and dose for polysaccharide specific total IgG and 
polysaccharide specific bactericidal response, additional dose-range finding studies were conducted in the 
selected strain of mice.  
Selected strain of mice were immunized two or three times with the optimized level of polysaccharide/dose or 
with a decreasing dose regimen (0.5 μg, 0.25 μg and 0.13 μg of each serogroup/dose). Except for serogroup 
C (SBA Titer), PS specific total IgG and bactericidal antibody titers were similar or higher three weeks after 
the final boost injection. Although three injections of the optimized level of PS resulted in higher SBA titer 
and IgG levels, the responses after two injections were also significantly increased in a short period of time 
compared to the physiological saline control, and thus the applicant regarded the three-dose schedule to not 
offer any advantage over the two-dose schedule. Variable data was observed for the decreasing dose 
regimen with no significant benefit observed over the unique dose regimen. 
The two-immunization schedule with optimized level of PS/dose associated with serum sampling three weeks 
post final boost were thus selected for PS specific total IgG and PS specific bactericidal response evaluation in 
the selected strain of mice. According to the submitted data immunological responses after three vaccinations 
were strongly increased compared to the two-dose regimen. Thus, the applicant’s conclusion that the three-
dose schedule does not offer ANY advantage over the two-dose schedule is not completely conclusive to the 
assessor. However, further studies using the two-dose schedule were subsequently performed and showed 
positive results when using the proposed dosing regimen. 
Subcutaneous injection was performed in mice to allow a higher volume to be administered as compared to 
the clinically used intramuscular route. Additional studies injecting higher volumes via the intramuscular 
route would be feasible, e.g. in NZW rabbit, but have not been conducted. Intramuscular injection was 
investigated in toxicological studies in rats. 
For immunogenicity evaluation of the final clinical formulation, groups of selected strain of mice were 
immunized with the GMP batch according to the dosing schedule determined in the previous studies, i.e. two 
subcutaneous injections (prime and booster) containing optimal concentration of each serogroup per dose. 
Three weeks after the second immunization the animals were bled and serum samples were tested using 
ELISA for PS specific total IgG determination and serum bactericidal assay (SBA) to determine PS specific 
bactericidal antibody titers. 
For serogroup A, total IgG response was higher for the TetraMen-T (Demo) batch than with the clinical 
formulation. Both meningococcal vaccine batches showed significantly higher total IgG responses than the 
physiological saline control. 
For serogroup C, vaccination responses for both, TetraMen-T (Demo) and clinical batch, were observed to be 
significantly higher than when using saline control. No significant differences were observed between 
serogroup C specific IgG responses induced by either TetraMen-T or TetraMen-Dt. However, in general, anti-
C IgG responses induced by two of the meningococcal vaccines available commercially were higher than the 
antibody responses induced by the TetraMen-T (Demo) and TetraMen-Dt vaccines and in some cases the 
results were significant. 
For serogroup Y and serogroup W135 similar results were obtained. All treatment groups showed significantly 
higher total IgG responses than the saline control, with TetraMen-T (Demo) formulation again showing 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 24/121 
 
  
  
  
somewhat but insignificant higher total IgG response than the clinical batch. For serogroup C, the response 
after vaccination with TetraMen-T was higher than with TetraMen-Dt. 
When testing for bactericidal antibody response, all serogroups were found significantly higher after 
meningococcal vaccination compared to the physiological saline control. For serogroup A and C, the 
TetraMen-T (Demo) formulation again showed significantly higher responses than the clinical formulation, for 
serogroup W135, the both TetraMen-T formulations showed significantly higher results than the saline, but 
the TetraMen-Dt formulation did not.  
There was a strong correlation between the level of PS specific IgG and bactericidal antibodies induced in 
mice injected with TetraMen-T formulations for serogroups A, Y, W135 whereas the correlation between IgG 
and bactericidal responses elicited by the TetraMen-Dt vaccine was not always evident. 
Summarized, MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine induced serogroup specific total IgG and bactericidal antibody 
responses in all serogroups (A, C, Y, W). Responses were significantly higher than the antibody responses 
observed in the saline control groups. There was a strong correlation between the level of PS specific IgG and 
bactericidal antibodies induced in mice injected with MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine formulations for 
serogroups A, Y, W, but not for serogroup C. 
Dedicated studies on secondary pharmacodynamics and safety pharmacology were not performed. This is in 
accordance with relevant guidance. Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 
However, interactions between MenQuadfi and other vaccines frequently administered to the same population 
have been investigated in clinical studies. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No non-clinical pharmacokinetics studies were submitted, which is in accordance with recent guidelines. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
To support vaccine development and registration, a non-clinical toxicology programme was designed to 
assess the toxicological profile of MenQuadfi. This programme comprises a repeated dose toxicity study in CD 
rats (Study AES/0126) and a preliminary immunogenicity study (Study RED_00091026) and DART study 
(Study SP00047 DV1701) in NZW rabbits. The design of these studies is considered to be in line with recent 
guidelines.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicology studies were performed in compliance with GLP, except for the immunogenicity study phase in 
the repeat-dose toxicity study (Study AES/0126) in rats which was conducted in a non-GLP compliant facility. 
The lack of GLP compliance has neither been explained by the applicant in sufficient detail nor justified. 
Therefore, it was decided that the results of this study should be considered as not relevant for the clinical 
use of MenQuadfi. Nevertheless, in the rat repeated dose toxicity study (Study AES/0126), no critical findings 
were reported, indicating that the administration of MenQuadfi was well tolerated in rats.  
However, several rats receiving the vaccine formulation did not show detectable antibody responses specific 
to an individual polysaccharide serogroup. Therefore, as the reliability of the results of study AES/0126 could 
not be sufficiently established, the applicant’s original statement in the SmPC section 5.3 (“Non-clinical safety 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 25/121 
 
  
  
  
data revealed no special risks for humans based on a repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance study in rats 
…”) was not supported. The applicant therefore conducted a change in the SmPC wording and deleted all 
references to the rat repeated dose toxicity study AES/0126. This amendment was considered acceptable 
On Day 2 of the study, dark faeces were noted in the bedding of all cages housing treated animals. The 
applicant remarked to this observation that with no evidence of histopathological changes this finding was not 
considered toxicologically significant. However, the lack of a histopathological correlate could of course also 
be related to a transient adverse effect at the beginning of the study that resolved during the further course 
of the study until the animals were killed and their organs histologically examined. Hence, the lack of a 
histopathological correlate cannot be used as rationale to consider that this finding is not of toxicological 
relevance. The fact that dark faeces were found in all cages of treated animals strongly suggests that this 
observation is treatment related. However, considering that the relevance of the rat repeated dose study for 
humans was doubted, it was unclear whether this finding also beared relevance for the clinical use of 
MenQuadfi. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
The absence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies is considered acceptable based on the type of 
product and in line with current guidelines on non-clinical evaluation of vaccines. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
A developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) study was conducted to evaluate the potential effects of 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine on female fertility, embryo-foetal development (including an evaluation of 
teratogenicity) and early post-natal development of female NZW rabbits. 
The study indicates that MenQuadfi does not pose relevant risks on the investigated endpoints of mating, 
fertility, ovarian and uterine parameters and natural delivery. Furthermore, MenQuadfi was demonstrated to 
be non-teratogenic, and no adverse effects were observed regarding pup survival, growth and development. 
In fact, the endpoints evaluated in the treatment group of this DART study were almost never statistically 
different to the ones of the vehicle group. In addition, the fact that antibodies against serogroup C capsular 
polysaccharides were detected in all treated dams and also in foetuses and pups indicates that the NZW 
rabbit was a suitable non-clinical model for the conduct of a DART study with MenQuadfi. 
Toxicokinetic data  
Studies assessing toxicokinetics of MenQuadfi have not been conducted. This is in line with applicable 
guidelines.  
Local Tolerance  
As part of the DART study in rabbits, the local tolerance to repeat IM doses of MenQuadfi vaccine was 
assessed in New Zealand White rabbits and no additional local tolerance studies were performed which is 
acceptable. 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the EMA ERA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*), an ERA should be provided for 
vaccine products that may consist of a justification for not submitting ERA studies, e.g. due to their nature 
they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.  
The applicant submitted a justification. In addition, as MenQuadfi does not contain adjuvants, the applicant’s 
position that MenQuadfi vaccine is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment was accepted by 
the Committee. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant refers to pharmacology studies in different animal species (mouse, rat, rabbit) where the 
species’ ability to produce an immune response to MenACYW conjugate vaccine has been compared. 
According to the Pharmacology written summary, the mouse model was chosen due to highest and most 
reproducible immune response. In humans, MenACYW conjugate vaccine is administered by intramuscular 
(IM) injection, while in the nonclinical studies, the vaccine is dosed subcutaneously (SC) to mice, and IM to 
rats and rabbits.  
Overall, results from the nonclinical experiments in selected strain of mice form a reasonable basis to justify 
selection of MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine formulation for further evaluation in the clinic. Due to factors such 
as difference in size, MHC/HLA dissimilarities, and differences with regard to route of administration and 
dosing regimen, animal models may have limited predictive value for immunogenicity in humans and results 
from animal studies should thus be considered with caution. The use of the tetanus toxoid (TT) conjugate 
protein, which is already in use in other vaccines, appears acceptable. The safety of the vaccine must be 
taken into account in this regard. 
The toxicology programme of this submission comprises a repeated dose toxicity study in CD rats (Study 
AES/0126), a preliminary immunogenicity study (Study RED_00091026) and a DART study (Study SP00047 
DV1701) in NZW rabbits. These studies demonstrate that MenQuadfi was well tolerated in the rat and the 
rabbit. Overall, the non-clinical safety data demonstrate that MenQuadfi has an acceptable safety profile. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a nonclinical point of view, marketing authorisation can be supported.

Ongoing and planned studies 
The applicant has listed ‘Long-term persistence of the vaccine response, and safety and immunogenicity of 
booster in individuals primed with MenACYW conjugate vaccine’ as missing information in the RMP. Further, 
according to the applicant the following clinical studies to assess the long-term immunogenicity of the 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine are currently ongoing or are planned: 
MET62: Phase IIIb follow-up of MET54. Immunogenicity and Safety of MenACYW conjugate vaccine given as 
a booster injection in children vaccinated 3 years earlier with MenACYW conjugate vaccine as toddlers 
MET59: Phase IIIb follow-up of MET50. Immunogenicity and Safety of MenACYW conjugate vaccine given as 
a Booster Injection in Adolescents and Adults vaccinated 3 to 6 years earlier with MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine. Additionally, this follow-up study aims to assess the effect of a booster vaccination with the 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine in recipients of either the MenACYW conjugate vaccine or the licensed vaccine 
Menveo, as well as the effect of concomitant administration of a Meningococcal group B vaccine with the 
booster dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies and main clinical studies 
Study MET28  
Study MET28 was a phase I, randomized, modified single-blind, active-controlled (infants only), four-stage, 
step-down (by age), comparative (comparator Menjugate [monovalent C vaccine]), multi-center study to the 
evaluate safety and immunogenicity of 3 formulations of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (previously referred to 
as TetraMen-T) in healthy adults (aged ≥ 18 through < 40 years), toddlers (aged ≥ 12 through < 19 
months), and infants (aged 2 months +28 days [60 through 88 days]) in Canada between July 25th 2006 and 
August 27th 2008.  
Study description 
The study included four stages:  
Stage I:  
Two groups of adults aged ≥ 18 to < 40 years received one injection of TetraMen-T: either a low-dose 
adjuvanted formulation (2 µg polysaccharide per serogroup with AlPO4) or a high-dose formulation (10 µg 
polysaccharide per serogroup) without adjuvant. 
Stage II: 
Two groups of toddlers aged ≥ 12 to < 19 months received one injection of TetraMen-T: either a low-dose 
adjuvanted formulation (2 µg polysaccharide per serogroup with AlPO4) or a high-dose formulation (10 µg 
polysaccharide per serogroup) without adjuvant. 
Stage III: 
Four groups of infants aged 2 months +28 days (60–88 days) at enrolment were to receive three doses of 
meningococcal vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, concomitantly with the routine vaccines Pentacel, 
Prevnar, and Engerix-B. The meningococcal vaccine was either to be the low-dose formulation of TetraMen-T 
(2 µg polysaccharide per serogroup without adjuvant), the low-dose adjuvanted formulation of TetraMen-T 
(2 µg polysaccharide per serogroup with AlPO4), the high-dose formulation of TetraMen-T (10 µg 
polysaccharide per serogroup without adjuvant), or the licensed meningococcal vaccine Menjugate. 
Menjugate (Novartis) is a monovalent (serogroup C) meningococcal vaccine conjugated to diphtheria CRM197 
protein. 
Stage IV: 
A subset of subjects from all 4 infant groups were to receive a booster dose of TetraMen-T at 13 months of 
age (±28 days). Subjects who had received one of the 3 formulations of TetraMen-T in Stage III were to be 
given the same formulation for their booster dose. Those subjects who had received Menjugate in Stage III 
were to be given the low-dose adjuvanted formulation of TetraMen-T for their booster dose. 
Blood for serological testing was collected before vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 0) from all subjects; at 28 to 42 
days after vaccination from adults and toddlers; and at 28 to 42 days after the 3rd vaccination from infants. 
Infants who received a 4th dose in the 2nd year of life also provided a blood sample just prior to vaccination 
and at 28 to 42 days after the 4th dose. 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Functional antibodies to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 were measured by serum bactericidal 
assay using human complement (SBA-HC) and/or baby rabbit complement (SBA-BR). No efficacy data were 
collected in this trial. 
Results 
Adults (Stage I): 
All adult subjects (100.0%) achieved rSBA titers ≥ 1:8 for the 4 serogroups after vaccination. For both 
formulations, geometric means of rSBA titers were significantly higher for all 4 serogroups after vaccination 
as compared to pre-vaccination levels. The magnitude of the antibody response was higher in Group 2 (10 μg 
vaccine) versus Group 1 (2 μg vaccine + AlPO4). 
Toddlers (Stage II): 
The percentages of toddlers with an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 were lowest for serogroup A in both groups: 52.6% in 
Group 3 (2 μg vaccine + AlPO4) and 63.2% in Group 4 (10 μg vaccine) relative to the other serogroups in 
both groups: 100.0%, 78.9%, and 68.4% for serogroups C, Y, and W, respectively in Group 3 and 89.5% for 
each of the serogroups C, Y, and W in Group 4. There was no increase in geometric mean titers (GMTs) post-
vaccination for serogroup A in Group 3 subjects, and just a marginal increase in Group 4 subjects. The 
highest increase was seen for serogroup C in both groups. 
Infants (Stage III): 
The percentage of infants, who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine, achieving an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 after 3 
doses ranged from 22.5% (Group 5, 2 μg vaccine) to 61.5% (Group 6, 2 μg vaccine + AlPO4) for serogroup 
A; from 94.9% (Group 6) to 97.6% (Group 5) for serogroup C; from 90.2% (Group 5) to 100.0% (Group 6) 
for serogroup Y; and from 83.3% (Group 7, 10 μg vaccine) to 87.2% (Group 6) for serogroup W. In the 
control group, 100.0% of subjects achieved a post-Dose 3 titer ≥ 1:8 for serogroup C. 
Infants (Stage IV, booster): 
After the 4th dose, an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 was achieved by 100.0% of subjects in Groups 5, 6, and 7 for 
serogroups Y and W; and by 83.3% to 100% for serogroup C. Similar to the other stages, the percentages of 
subjects achieving hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 for serogroup A was lower relative to the other serogroups in all groups, 
ranging from 22.2% in Group 7 to 58.3% in Group 6. The percentages were lower for Group 8 (Menjugate) 
subjects, who were receiving MenACYW conjugate vaccine for the first time. Post-Dose 4 GMTs confirmed the 
same low immune responses to serogroup A and robust immune responses for the other 3 serogroups in 
Groups 5, 6, and 7. 
Study MET32 
Study MET32 was a phase I/II, exploratory, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled (comparator 
NeisVac-C vaccine), parallel, multi-center study to the evaluate safety and immunogenicity of 2 formulations 
and different dose levels of TetraMen-T Quadrivalent Meningococcal (A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide 
Tetanus Protein Conjugate Vaccine in healthy, meningococcal vaccine-naïve toddlers (12 months ±21 days

Study description 
The vaccine formulation underwent optimization to address the lower immune response to serogroup A 
observed in MET28, and study MET32 was conducted to evaluate 2 new formulations. Each of these 2 
formulations of MenACYW conjugate vaccine was evaluated at different dose levels (described below), in 
order to look for a dose-response effect. The doses selected were based on the results from study MET28. 
A single dose of one of the formulations or control vaccine was evaluated in a total of 368 toddlers aged 12 
months (± 21 days) randomized to one of the following 6 groups: 
•  Group 1: Formulation 1, low dose (4 μg polysaccharide per serogroup; and a total of 22.1 μg tetanus 
toxoid protein) 
•  Group 2: Formulation 1, intermediate dose (4 μg polysaccharide per serogroups C and Y; 10 μg 
polysaccharide per serogroups A and W; and a total of 36.6 μg tetanus toxoid protein) 
•  Group 3: Formulation 1, high dose (10 μg polysaccharide per serogroup; and a total of 54.8 μg 
tetanus toxoid protein) 
•  Group 4: Formulation 2, low dose (4 μg polysaccharide per serogroup; and a total of 33.9 μg tetanus 
toxoid protein) 
•  Group 6: Formulation 2, high dose (10 μg polysaccharide per serogroup; and a total of 84.8 μg 
tetanus toxoid protein) 
•  Group 7: NeisVac-C (10 μg N. meningitidis group C polysaccharide, 10 to 20 μg tetanus toxoid, 
0.5 mg Al3+ from aluminum hydroxide) 
Blood for serological testing was collected from all subjects at Visit 1 (Day 0) before vaccination, and at Visit 
2, 30 days (+7 days) after vaccination. Immunogenicity was assessed using hSBA and rSBA. 
No efficacy data were collected in this trial.

Formulation Differences 
Data from this study have been used to support the final decision on the formulation to be carried forward in 
subsequent clinical studies. 
The addition of the ADH linker improved antibody responses for serogroup A as demonstrated in the results 
using either human (Table 3.2) or baby rabbit complement sources in the SBA assay. Supported by the 
clinical results from Study MET32 (formulation 1 and formulation 2), the formulation evaluated in subsequent 
Phase II studies was a combination of serogroups A and C from formulation 1 and serogroups Y and W from 
formulation 2. 
The conjugation chemistry for serogroup A was the same chemistry that was used in formulation 1 (ADH 
linker using CDI). The results of the Phase I/II clinical trial indicated that the high pH conjugation formulation 
2 resulted in slightly more immunogenic conjugates; however, the higher polysaccharide:protein loading ratio 
was also lower likely due to base catalyzed hydrolysis of the polysaccharide and/or reactive aldehyde groups. 
Therefore, for the subsequent Phase II clinical trial the conjugation reaction was maintained at pH 8.0 ± 0.2 
in order to maintain a higher polysaccharide: protein loading ratio, but a base treatment (partial de-O-
acetylation) step was added to the polysaccharide activation/depolymerization process. The resulting 
serogroup C conjugate was the most immunogenic conjugate tested. The conjugation chemistry for 
serogroup C was the same chemistry that was used in Phase I formulation 1 with the exception of a base 
treatment of the polysaccharide prior to activation by sodium metaperiodate. For serogroups Y and W, the 
results of Study MET32 indicated that the higher pH conjugation (formulation 2) resulted in slightly more 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 35/121 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
immunogenic conjugates, and therefore, the conjugation reaction was maintained at pH 9.5 ± 0.5 for the 
Phase II batches. The conjugation chemistry for serogroups Y and W was the same chemistry that was used 
in Phase I formulation 2.

MAA and are presented if not indicated otherwise in this order in each section. 
MET 51 
Phase III, modified double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, multi-center trial to compare 
the immunogenicity and describe the safety of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine to a single dose 
of a licensed quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide groups A, C, W-135, and Y conjugate vaccine 
(MenACWY-TT, Nimenrix) in toddlers (12 to 23 months of age) in the European Union (Spain, Hungary, 
Finland and Germany) who were either meningococcal vaccine-naïve or had received monovalent MenC 
vaccination during infancy. 
Healthy toddlers aged 12 to 23 months were randomized as follows depending on their meningococcal 
vaccine background: 
Meningococcal vaccine-naïve subjects: 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the following 2 groups:

Group 4: Nimenrix 
Enrollment of MenC-primed subjects was stratified by the type of primed vaccine, MenC-TT (NeisVac-C) or 
MenC-CRM (Menjugate, Meningitec), considering that at least 25% and a maximum of 50% of subjects were 
to have been primed with MenC-CRM.

Immunological assays 
Functional meningococcal antibody activity against serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 is measured using serum 
bactericidal antibody (SBA) assay. The SBA is an in vitro method using a complement source from either 
baby rabbit (BR) or human (HC), that measures the antibody-mediated, complement-dependent killing of 
target bacteria for the purpose of measuring the immunological response to the capsular polysaccharides of 
Neisseria meningitides serogroups A, C, Y, or W-135. Bacteria, complement, and serially diluted serum are 
incubated together in microtiter plates. An agar overlay is added to the serum/complement/bacteria mixture 
and the plates are incubated again. The number of resulting bacterial colonies present in the wells is 
inversely proportional to the level of functional antibody present in the serum, which correlates with the 
immunological response of the subject. The endpoint titer is determined by the reciprocal serum dilution 
yielding ≥ 50% killing compared to the mean of the complement control wells containing no serum. 
Immunity acquired through either natural exposure or vaccination to meningococcal antigens has been shown 
to correlate well with the level of complement-dependent bactericidal antibody detected by the SBA. The 
SBA-determined level of these functional antibodies is considered a widely acceptable surrogate of protective 
immunity and acceptable evidence for efficacy of vaccines prepared from the capsular polysaccharides of N. 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135. The surrogate was established from the assay utilizing human 
complement. To facilitate inter-laboratory comparisons of the bactericidal activity induced by meningococcal 
vaccines, an SBA-BR assay was established through a multi-laboratory study conducted by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in which Sanofi Pasteur participated. In 1999, under the auspices of 
the WHO, a meeting was held to further assess laboratory assays for the analysis of human serum for 
meningococcal serogroup A- and C-specific antibodies. From that meeting, several recommendations were 
made regarding the SBAs; including adoption of the CDC standardized SBA-BR as the optimal methodology to 
measure meningococcal antibodies. However, recent developments in the field have led CBER to require a 
human complement– based assay for the assessment and licensure of meningococcal vaccines. Overall, the 
comparison indicates that both assays demonstrate serogroup specificity.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Throughout comparative immunogenicity studies, subjects were randomly assigned to respective vaccination 
groups. Depending on the study population and objective, randomisation was stratified by demographic 
parameters (e.g. MET51: priming status, MET35, MET57, MET49: age). In several studies, stratification was 
not accounted for in the statistical analysis. Importantly, the statistical analysis of lot to lot consistency 
(MET43) did not take into account the stratified randomization by age-group. 
Since the primary objectives of the studies had serological endpoints and the vaccines for the study groups 
had different appearances, the studies had a modified double-blind design. This means it contained an 
unblinded vaccine administrator while the subject/the subject’s parent/LAR, the Investigator, the Sponsor 
and the rest of the study team, including laboratory technicians in charge of executing the serological testing, 
remained blinded to the subjects’ group allocations throughout the entire study up to the database lock to 
avoid any bias. The unblinded site personnel prepared all vaccines, and then administered the vaccines to the 
subjects and did not participate in any safety evaluation of the subjects during study conduct. 
Study 50 and 57, both evaluating MenQuadfi with concomitant vaccinations were open-label studies where 
only the laboratory technicians were blinded to group assignment.

Missing data will not be imputed. No test or search for outliers will be performed. 
Analysis sets: 
The FAS is defined as the subset of subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study vaccine and had a 
valid post-vaccination serology result. All subjects will be analysed according to the treatment group to which 
they were randomized. 
Safety Analysis Set: The SafAS is defined as those subjects who have received at least 1 dose of the study 
vaccine and have any safety data available. All subjects will have their safety analysed according to the 
vaccine they actually received. If the vaccine received by a subject does not correspond to any study group, 
the subject will be excluded from the SafAS. The corresponding safety data will be presented in separate 
listings. 
Per-Protocol Analysis Set: The PPAS is a subset of the FAS. The subjects presenting with at least one of the 
following relevant protocol deviations will be excluded from the PPAS: Subject did not meet all protocol-
specified inclusion criteria or met at least one of the protocol-specified exclusion criteria: […] 
Co-primary 1 (naïve and primed): 
Each of the serogroups A, C, Y, and W were tested separately. If the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the 2 percentages was > -10%, the inferiority assumption 
was rejected. For the 4 non-inferiority hypotheses using the response rates (percentages of subjects who 
achieved an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8), the 95% CI was stratified on the priming status (meningococcal vaccine naïve 
or primed with monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy) and calculated using the Wald method (normal 
approximation). Weighted average of the difference over strata was calculated using the Minimal Risk weights 
with the null variance method (10).

Primary objective 1: 
Each of the antigens of A, C, Y, and W serogroups was tested separately. If the 2-sided 95% CI of the ratio of 
the GMTs was > 1/2 and < 2 for each pair of lots and each antigen, the non-equivalence assumption was 
rejected (i.e. if the equivalence was demonstrated for each pair of lots). 
For each of the equivalence hypotheses using the GMT ratios, the statistical methodology was based on the 
use of the 2-sided 95% CI of difference in means of postvaccination Log10 transformed titers between pairs 
of lots with normal approximation.

Ancillary analyses 
Post-hoc Evaluation of the Superiority of MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine 
Superiority of immune response of MenACYW conjugate vaccine, in terms of hSBA seroprotection rate 
(≥1:8), as compared to the respective comparator vaccine was tested as a posthoc analysis in meningococcal 
vaccine-naïve subjects of MET35, MET43, MET49, MET50, and MET51 Studies per Scientific Advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/467602/2015) as all these five studies demonstrated non-inferiority of immune response 
between MenACYW conjugate vaccine and comparator vaccines. The serogroups were sequentially tested in 
the order of C, Y, W, and A to follow the epidemiological prevalence as observed globally across various age

Superiority was achieved if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference was greater than 0%.

Superiority of the immune response induced by MenACYW conjugate vaccine in terms of hSBA seroprotection

Nimenrix in MET51. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Integrated Analysis 
Data obtained from the 9 Phase II and Phase III studies assessing the final formulation of MenACYW 
conjugate vaccine given as a single dose (Phase II studies MET44, MET50, and MET54, and Phase III studies 
MET35, MET43, MET49, MET51, MET56, and MET57) were presented in a pooled / integrated analysis report 
(5.3.5.3 Efficacy Integrated Analysis Report). 
All Phase II and Phase III studies included in the pooled / integrated analysis report (see Table 1.3) were 
consistent in terms of general study design, the assessment of outcome measures, vaccine formulation, and 
in terms of the use of the hSBA assay for the assessment of bactericidal antibody titers against N 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. The immunogenicity pooled / integrated analysis was performed by 
meningococcal vaccine background (whether meningococcal vaccine-naïve or vaccine-primed). 
The analysis for the meningococcal vaccine-naïve subjects was performed by the following age groups: 
• Toddlers 12 to 23 months (pooled MET51, MET54, and MET57) (N=1174) 
• Children 2 through 9 years of age (MET35) (Na=458) 
• Adolescents 10 through 17 years of age (pooled MET43 and MET50) (N=1921) 
• Adults 18 through 55 years of age (MET43) (N=1410) 
• Older adults and elderly ≥ 56 years of age (pooled MET44 and MET49) (N=628) 
• Older adults 56 through 64 years of age (N=290) 
• Elderly adults ≥ 65 years of age (N=338) 
• Elderly adults 65 through 74 years of age (N=252) 
• Elderly adults ≥ 75 years of age (N=86) 
The analysis for the meningococcal vaccine-primed subjects was performed in the following age groups: 
• Toddlers 12 to 23 months (MET51) (N=198) 
• Adolescents and adults ≥15 years (MET56) (N=384)

Supportive studies 
Study MET44  
Study MET44 was a phase II, randomized, open-label (the laboratory technicians were blinded to group 
assignment), active-controlled, multi-center study to compare safety and immunogenicity of MenACYW 
conjugate vaccine to the comparator Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 in healthy meningococcal vaccine-naïve 
subjects 56 years of age and older in between November 12th 2012 and January 17th 2013.  
The applicant’s conclusion that a difference between subjects’ age of 56-64 years or ≥64 appeared to have 
not an impact on the immune response is supported. 
There was a trend towards higher seroresponse rates in group 1 (MenQuadfi) compared to group 2 
(Menomune). No concerns arise from the presented data. 
Study MET54  
Study MET54 was a phase II, randomized, parallel, open-label, active-controlled, multi-center study to 
compare safety and immunogenicity of MenACYW conjugate vaccine to the comparator Nimenrix in toddlers 
in Finland between 31 March 2015 and 19 August 2015.  
Seroresponse rates 30 days following vaccination were in general comparable between MenQuadfi and 
Nimenrix.  
This study was one of only two studies conducted in the EU in support of this MAA. Regarding differences 
compared to the toddlers study conducted outside the EU, please refer to assessment and the respective OC 
of study MET57. 
Study MET39 
Study MET39 was a phase II, randomized, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate 5 different schedules of 
MenACYW conjugate vaccination regarding safety and immunogenicity compared to concomitant routine 
paediatric vaccination (not including meningococcal vaccination) in healthy infants and toddlers in the US 
between December 16st 2009 and February 13th 2012.  
This study is included in the AR for completeness only. The included patient population does not reflect the 
intended target population of this MAA. Therefore, no assessment of the immunogenicity or safety results 
was done. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Immunogenicity of MenQuadfi has been evaluated in seven pivotal studies. Additional evidence has been 
generated in five supportive studies.  
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 71/121 
 
  
  
  
Overall, the design of the presented main studies is similar and considered adequate. In all studies the 
subjects received one dose of MenQuadfi or a comparator vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated 
immediately before vaccination and 30 days after vaccination. No immunogenicity data beyond 30 days after 
vaccination are currently available which is also considered as missing information in the RMP. The applicant 
plans three post marketing studies to provide respective data for long-term immune persistence. The studies 
will also evaluate the ability of MenQuadfi to boost itself. All three studies are added in Annex II as category I 
post-marketing obligations.    
In a scientific advice it was agreed to base the clinical development programme on immunogenicity studies 
and that no efficacy studies are necessary. This is based on the fact that a widely accepted immunological 
correlate of protection for meningococcal vaccines containing serogroups A, C, W and Y exists. This approach 
has also been used for licensing of previous conjugated meningococcal vaccines in Europe (Menveo, 
Nimenrix). This is also in line with the relevant EMA and WHO guidelines. The use of hSBA for primary 
immunogenicity analyses was adequately justified by the applicant and accepted in a previous SA. As 
supportive evidence, the applicant also provided data derived from rSBA for all patients in studies MET 50, 56 
and 35 and for a subset of subjects in studies MET 43, 49, 51 and 57.  
The presented serological assays are overall considered appropriate and suitable to generate sufficient data 
on immunogenicity of the vaccine.  
The applicant presented three main endpoints for the evaluation of immunogenicity: seroprotection, 
seroresponse and geometric mean titers (GMTs). Seroprotection is defined as the percentage of subjects with 
an hSBA titer ≥1:8 while seroresponse extends this definition by taking into account prevaccination titers: 
For subjects with a pre-vaccination titer ≥1:8, an at least 4-fold increase of titer needs to be demonstrated. 
In addition, GMTs are presented for each vaccination group, allowing the assessment of differences in 
immune response between vaccines. In general, the chosen endpoints seroresponse, seroprotection and 
GMTs were considered acceptable and adequate to address the study objectives. Additionally, percentages of 
subjects achieving an at least 4-fold increase of titres and RCDs were presented. 
Although the cut-off for definition of hSBA seroprotection was ≥1:8, as also recommended in the SA, the 
applicant used a cut-off of ≥1:16 for definition of seroresponse in most of the pivotal studies (reaching an 
hSBA titer of ≥1:16 if <1:8 pre-vaccination or achieving a 4-fold increase in hSBA titer if ≥1:8 pre-
vaccination). This is based on requirements of CBER/FDA. Although a hSBA titer of ≥1:4 can be considered 
as widely accepted correlate of protection for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y, the use of higher cut-
offs does not raise concerns per se.  
In 4 studies non-inferiority of seroresponse rates after MenQuadfi against a comparator vaccine (quadrivalent 
meningococcal vaccine) was the primary objective (MET35, MET43, MET49, MET50). In study MET51, the 
primary objective was non-inferiority of seroprotection rates. It was not considered acceptable to adequately 
assess immunogenicity by sole achievement of a protective titer regardless of prevaccination titres in light of 
the rather high percentage of subjects with seroprotective titres at baseline. For seropositive subjects at 
baseline an, at least, 4-fold increase of titer needs to be demonstrated. Upon request, the non-inferiority 
analysis of seroresponse for study MET57 was also provided. The evaluation of seroresponse was considered 
more informative for the assessment of immunogenicity.  
The applicant justified the applied non-inferiority margins mainly based on precedence from other 
development programs, as well as feasibility concerns. A justification based on clinical considerations (e.g. 
relevance of a 10% lower seroresponse rate in terms of vaccine efficacy) or statistical considerations (e.g. 
assay sensitivity) was considered missing. However, given the reference to other development programmes 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 72/121 
 
  
  
  
as well as the clear demonstration of NI against various comparator vaccines across studies, this issue was 
not further pursued. 
No alternative vaccination schedule has been evaluated in the presented studies. Also, in the dose-finding 
studies, only one dose of MenQuadfi was investigated. Only study MET39 investigated different vaccination 
schedules, where the study population (healthy infants) does not reflect the currently intended target 
population (subjects from 12 months of age). In a previous scientific advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/467602/2015), it was recommended to include evaluation of one vs. two doses in one of 
the toddler studies. However, no such data are available. Of note, nonclinical immunogenicity data are only 
available from a two (or more) dose regimen. Based on non-clinical data it was therefore not considered self-
evident why only a one-dose-regimen was investigated in clinical studies. Given the absence of persistence 
data as well as the general knowledge of rapid waning of antibodies against serogroup A from other licensed 
vaccines, a justification for the absence of investigation of one vs two doses in toddlers was requested. The 
applicant explained that no other vaccination schedules have been tested in toddlers since MenQuadfi was 
evaluated compared to the current standard of care in the EU (MET51: Nimenrix) with the respective 
vaccination schedule of a single dose. The applicant argued that further investigations of other vaccination 
schedules are not necessary since non-inferiority to Nimenrix has been shown. It was acknowledged that 
non-inferiority of seroresponse has been shown compared to Nimenrix at D30. However, no long-term data is 
available. Given that rapid waning has been observed for other MenACYW vaccines, and no data exists that 
this does not apply for MenQuadfi, a general statement on rapid waning of antibodies against serogroup A 
known from other vaccines was added in section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
The studies evaluating MenQuadfi with a comparator vaccine all had a modified double-blind design. Only the 
vaccine administrator (preparation and administration of vaccines, no involvement in safety evaluation) was 
unblinded in these studies. This was considered necessary due to the different appearances of the vaccines. 
However, it was unclear what measures were in place to ensure blinding of the subject. The applicant 
explained that to ensure blinding of the subject, the route of administration was not discussed with the 
participant and evaluation of the safety reports was done by a blinded study personnel. Since it is unlikely 
that potential unblinding has an impact on the immunogenicity endpoints and from a safety perspective 
except for an increased frequency of solicited injection site reactions, no differences in safety profile are 
observed between the two study groups, no further concerns remained. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were in general comparable over all pivotal studies and specific aspects 
are adequately reflected. The eligible age of the subjects differs between studies resulting in population 
ranging from toddlers (12 to 23 months) up to older adults (≥ 56 years). Although the whole age range is 
adequately represented, the population of subjects previously primed with a meningococcal vaccine is 
limited. Primed subjects have only been included in two studies: Study MET56 included adolescent and adult 
subjects (15-55 years) previously vaccinated with a meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccine and study 
MET51 included toddlers who received a monovalent meningococcal C conjugate (MenC) vaccination during 
infancy. In multiple European countries MenC vaccination is recommended for toddlers and later quadrivalent 
MenACWY vaccination for adolescents. No data for MenQuadfi are available from primed adolescents or adults 
previously vaccinated with MenC. Moreover, in study MET56 subjects who previously received quadrivalent 
MenACWY vaccination were included with the majority of subjects primed with Menactra, a vaccine that is not 
licensed in the EU. Only very limited data of subjects previously vaccinated with Menveo are available and no 
data of subjects previously vaccinated with Nimenrix.  In addition, no data are available to assess the ability 
of MenQuadfi to boost itself. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC and will be addressed in the planned 
postmarketing studies.  
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 73/121 
 
  
  
  
Overall, data generated in the EU is limited. Only one of the seven pivotal studies (MET51) and one 
supportive study (MET54) were conducted in the EU. Both studies included healthy toddlers aged 12 to 23 
months. No EU data is available for children, adolescents or adults. From other (EU-licensed) meningococcal 
vaccines, it is known that the ethnic background and also the geographical region can have significant 
influence on the circulating serotypes and the potential degree of carriage. The impact of intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors on study results and their potential to limit the interpretation and applicability of the results, 
has also been addressed in respective ICH and EMA guidance documents (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/692702/2008). 
Different baseline seroprotection rates have been observed in the regions included in the developmental 
programme. An additional comparison of seroresponse rates in toddlers based on data obtained in study 
MET51 (EU) and study MET57 (Russia, Mexico, South Korea and Thailand) showed comparable seroresponse 
data despite baseline differences. Although no comparative data are available for subjects beyond the toddler 
age, presented data provided some reassuring evidence that immunogenicity of MenQuadfi derived from 
subjects outside EU can be extrapolated to EU subjects  
Different comparators have been used in the presented studies. The comparators - Menveo and Nimenrix - 
chosen for toddlers, children and adolescents are both licensed in the EU and contain the same serogroups as 
MenQuadfi. On the other hand, the chosen comparators Menactra and Menomune used in adolescents, adults 
and elderly, are not considered optimal from an EU point of view. Both vaccines are not licensed in the EU 
and it would have been preferred at least some comparative immunogenicity data against an EU licensed 
vaccine in adults and elderly, which has been also addressed during a preceding scientific advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/467602/2015). It was also mentioned that Menactra is not a particularly good conjugate 
vaccine. Moreover, Menomune is a polysaccharide vaccine with generally known drawbacks regarding 
immunogenicity. As mentioned in the scientific advice, the assessment will focus on seropositivity and 
seroconversion rates rather than on non-inferiority against Menactra or Menomune (although meeting non-
inferiority would still be expected). Consequently, the assessment in adolescents (10-17) was also focused on 
the comparison against Menveo in study MET50. The applicant submitted a network meta-analysis comparing 
the immunogenicity of MenACYW in adult and elderly subjects to Menveo by extrapolation from historical 
studies of the corresponding comparator vaccines (Menactra, Menomune) with Menveo. However, as stated 
by the applicant, the analysis has several methodological shortcomings leaving a large margin of uncertainty. 
Consequently, the results were not considered conclusive.  
The immunogenicity of MenQuadfi has also been studied in combination with different concomitant 
vaccinations (MET50, MET57). In toddlers, concomitant vaccination with MMR, Varicella, hexavalent vaccine 
(DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) and PCV13 (pneumococcal vaccine) (MET57) and in adolescents, concomitant vaccination 
with TdaP and HPV was investigated (MET50). Although both studies were conducted outside the EU, all used 
concomitant vaccinations are also licensed in the EU. The obtained results are therefore relevant for the EU 
population. Nevertheless, it was not considered straightforward to extrapolate data from one particular 
vaccine to all vaccines containing the same antigens. Notably, variable enhancement or depression of 
immune responses to conjugated saccharides has been observed when the carrier proteins for co-
administered products are the same or different, so that generalisations cannot be made beyond the specific 
vaccines studied as also stated in the respective EMA guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines 
(EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 Rev. 1). The SmPC was revised accordingly.  
Initially no Statistical Analysis Reports were submitted. Corresponding documents were provided on request. 
Protocol amendments occurred in all studies, except MET51 and were mainly clarifications and updates of 
logistical issues or amendments concerning the addition of hSBA immunogenicity on the request of 
CBER/FDA. In study MET43 non GCP conform findings have been made at one study site. Affected subjects 
were excluded from the analysis, and results of respective sensitivity analyses showed no apparent 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 74/121 
 
  
  
  
differences in immune responses across the treatment groups. A GCP inspection was performed in 2019 for 
this study by the FDA together with study MET35. The final report is still pending but based on preliminary 
report,s no inspection findings were identified. Further, a routine GCP inspection for study MET57 was 
performed in Q1 2020 by EMA. No critical findings were identified. Some major findings were identified but it 
is not likely that the observed findings have an effect on the reported data. With the exception of 
underreporting of certain AEs at site #402 (local reaction at injection site within 30 minutes), for which the 
sponsor provided adequate corrective actions and the CSR was updated in May 2020. 
The applicant presented an elaborate multiple testing strategy for the conclusion of superiority across 
serogroups and age strata, which is partly motivated by epidemiological arguments. Nevertheless, post-hoc 
the potential risk for erroneous conclusions cannot be quantified. Consequently, the applied methods were 
not considered adequate. Furthermore, it was not considered straightforward to use seroprotection rates for 
superiority testing instead of seroresponse rates that were used for NI-testing. However, no concerns were 
raised as these results were considered supportive only. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In six of the seven pivotal studies, antibody response of MenQuadfi was compared to different comparators 
(Nimenrix, Menveo, Menactra, Menomune) in different age groups from toddlers of 12 - 23 months to adults 
≥56 years. In all these studies the primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of MenQuadfi against the 
comparator vaccine was met for all serogroups. In all but one study non-inferiority was based on 
seroresponse rates. Only in study MET51 non-inferiority of seroprotection rate was tested. Upon request, an 
additional non-inferiority analysis of seroresponse was provided where non-inferiority was also met for all 
serogroups. 
The applicant presented a post-hoc testing strategy for the conclusion of superiority across serogroups and 
age strata. Although partly motivated by epidemiological arguments, the potential risk for erroneous 
conclusions cannot be quantified and the applied methods were not considered adequate. Consequently, 
these results were considered supportive only. 
In general, it was observed that seroresponse and seroprotection rates were higher in younger subjects 
(toddlers, children and adolescents) and declined with age. However, this was not unexpected and was also 
observed in the comparator groups. Across studies and age groups, MenQuadfi seroresponse rates for 
serogroup A were lower compared to C, W and Y. 
In meningococcal-vaccination-naïve subjects seroresponse rates were even higher for MenQuadfi for all 
serogroups in all age groups compared to the comparators with only some exceptions such as for serogroup 
A in toddlers where the seroresponse rate was lower compared to that of Nimenrix, while still meeting non-
inferiority criteria for seroprotection. For children the seroresponse rates for serogroup A were numerically 
higher than for Menveo, but the difference is marginal. 
However, subgroup analyses for MenC-primed toddlers revealed significant differences for serogroup A 
between MenQuadfi and Nimenrix in favour of Nimenrix. While seroresponse rates for serogroups W, C and Y 
were comparable or even slightly higher for MenQuadfi compared to Nimenrix, the seroresponse rate for 
serogroup A was significantly lower for MenQuadfi: 76.1% (69.6; 81.9) vs 90.8% (83.3; 95.7). The same 
was also observed for serogroup A post vaccination GMTs in MenC-primed toddlers: 31.8 (26.5; 38.1) vs 64 
(50.9; 80.5). This observation is mainly driven by higher seroresponse rates and GMTs observed after the 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 75/121 
 
  
  
  
administration of Nimenrix. Overall, seroresponse rates were comparable between MenC-primed and 
meningococcal-vaccination-naïve toddlers receiving MenQuadfi.  
However, distinct differences were observed depending on the previously received MenC vaccination 
conjugate protein (TT or CRM). In the MenQuadfi group, seroresponse rates for serogroups A and W were 
distinctly lower for MenC-CRM primed subjects than for MenC-TT primed subjects with non-overlapping CIs 
(A: 50.0% (35.2; 64.8) vs 84.6% (77.7; 90.0); W: 44.7% (30.2; 59.9) vs 85.2 (78.5; 90.5)). Such 
differences were not as pronounced in the control group (Nimenrix) with only numerically lower seroresponse 
rates. Although the results should be interpreted cautiously, since the study was not powered for this 
subgroup analysis and the number of subjects in the respective subgroups is low (MenC-CRM: (MenQuadfi 
48, Nimenrix 25), it has to be noted that this difference has not been observed with Nimenrix. Overall, an 
impact of the conjugate used for priming cannot be ruled out and respective amendments to the SmPC were 
made in order to include warnings for subjects at high risk for a MenA infection who previously received a 
Men-C-CRM vaccination.  
An analysis of seroresponse rate in primed toddlers according to the number of doses (1 or 2) of previous 
MenC vaccination (NeisVac-C) showed lower response for subjects with one priming dose with slightly 
overlapping CIs for MenQuadfi. This was not observed for Nimenrix. However, seroprotection rates were 
comparable across all subgroups.   
In quadrivalent meningococcal primed adolescents and adults the analyses of seroresponse rates and GMT 
according to previous vaccination (Menactra, Menveo or unknown) did not reveal any concerns. However, the 
number of patients previously vaccinated with Menveo were limited and need therefore be interpreted 
cautiously.  
For meningococcal-vaccination-naïve subjects it was observed across studies that seroresponse rates were 
lower in subjects with seroprotective titres at baseline. Interestingly, this was not observed in meningococcal-
primed subjects. 
It has been also noted in general that baseline seroprotection rates for serogroup A were much higher than 
for all other serogroups but differed between studies. As mentioned above this issue was addressed by the 
applicant by a comparison of seroresponse rates in toddlers based on data obtained in study MET51 (EU) and 
study MET57 (Russia, Mexico, South Korea and Thailand) which showed comparable seroresponse data 
despite baseline differences.  Further, considering the balanced randomization and stratification by country 
and, most important, the definition of seroresponse, no further concerns arised.  
In study MET56 non-inferiority of seroresponse rates was demonstrated for MenQuadfi when administered as 
booster vaccination to subjects (adolescents and adults) who previously received a quadrivalent 
meningococcal conjugate vaccine 4 to 10 years before, compared to Menactra with even (numerically) higher 
seroresponse rates and GMTs for all serotypes in favour of MenQuadfi. As most subjects previously received 
Menactra, a concern was raised in how far data mainly derived from subjects who previously received a 
vaccine not licensed in the EU can be extrapolated to the European population. Furthermore, no data from 
adults and adolescents who were primed with a MenC vaccine were available. However, data from the toddler 
study are reassuring to some degree that MenQuadfi can elicit a sufficient immune response in subjects 
primed with EU-licensed vaccines. As there is no clinically plausible reason to assume that there might be a 
difference between toddlers and older age groups, this issue was considered resolved. Furthermore, 
additional data will be gathered in the postmarketing by the planned/ongoing studies. Additionally, it would 
have been informative to compare boosting between subjects that have been primed with different 
conjugates, as also recommended by the WHO. Available data from study MET56 didn’t allow meaningful 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

evaluation in this regard, since mainly Menactra primed subjects were included. As mentioned above, in 
toddlers some differences were observed depending on the piming vaccine. Although these data had some 
limitations due to the low number of subjects in the subgroups, this observation should be described in the 
SmPC. Respective amendments were made. 
In addition, no data are currently available to assess the ability of MenQuadfi to boost itself. This is planned 
for the postmarketing, which was considered acceptable. The planned studies have been included in Annex II. 
Concomitant vaccination: Study MET57 investigated the immunogenicity of concomitant vaccination of 
MenQuadfi with paediatric vaccines (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13). Although the study was 
performed outside of the EU, the used concomitant vaccinations are also licensed in the EU. Seroresponse 
rates achieved with MenQuadfi alone compared to concomitant vaccination with MMR+V and DTaP-IPV-HB-
Hib do not give rise to concern on concomitant vaccination. Results didn’t suggest a negative effect of 
MenQuadfi on the immunogenicity of the concomitantly administered vaccines. However, the clinical 
relevance of rather low seroresponse rates and significantly lower GMTs for serogroup A when MenQuadfi is 
concomitantly administered with PCV13 for both seronegative and seropositive subjects at baseline, was 
unclear (seroresponse rate S+ and S-: 56.1% (48.9; 63.2) vs. 71.9% (61.8; 80.6); seroresponse rate S+: 
37.5% (27.8; 48.0) vs. 57.7% (43.2; 71.3); GMT: 24.6 (20.2; 30.1) vs. 49.0 (36.8; 65.3). In consequence, 
a respective warning for subjects at high risk for a MenA infection was included in the SmPC.   
Study MET50 investigated concomitant vaccination of MenQuadfi and TdaP and HPV in adolescents. While no 
concerns arised for Tetanus, Diphterie and HPV, the concomitant vaccination had negative consequences on 
the immune response to pertussis antigens, as shown by non-inferiority analysis of GMCs. The lower limit of 
the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of GMCs in Group 3 (MenQuadfi+TdaP+HPV) and Group 4 (TdaP+HPV) was 
>2/3 in only one (PT) of the 4 pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM). Even though the clinical 
consequences of a decreased immune response for 3 of 4 pertussis antigens was not entirely clear, and 
similar observations were reported for other meningococcal vaccines, this result was considered relevant for 
practical use and thus, has been providedin the product information. This effect was not observed in other 
studies addressing concomitant vaccinations with vaccines containing Pertussis antigens (MET57 and MET28 
(supportive)). However, the administered vaccines differed between studies as did the age of study subjects 
(adolescents, toddlers and infants).  
Lot-to-lot consistency was demonstrated in study MET43 for all three lots based on hSBA GMTs. However, 
significant differences between lot 1 and lot 2 were observed in terms of seroresponse rate against serogroup 
A (difference of -5.4; 95% CI: -9.59; -1.16). While GMT was considered more sensitive to detect differences 
between lots, this finding raised the concern whether the chosen equivalence criteria for the primary analysis 
based on GMTs were adequate. The applicant argued that no concern regarding a potentially relevant 
difference in terms of immunogenicity between lots should be raised as “the 95% CIs between the two study 
groups overlap (73.5; 79.4 vs 67.9; 74.2) even with large sample size around 800 per lot.” However, for the 
comparison of averages between groups the confidence interval around the estimate of the between group 
difference was a more sensitive approach (due to the more efficient variance estimate) and therefore the 
relevant procedure for the conclusion of equivalence. While formally meeting the equivalence margin of +-
10%, the result may indicate a significant difference in serorespones rates, and the lower CI limit is very 
close to the pre-defined margin. It was acknowledged that this was a secondary analysis and that the 
primary equivalence objective was met. Furthermore, there were no concerns regarding inconsistency 
between lots from a quality assessment perspective. In addition, the applicant provided upon request results 
from a re-analysis of pre-/post-vaccination titres using an ANCOVA type model. The presented model 
adjusted comparisons of post-vaccination titres between lots of MenACYW for differences in baseline titre 
between subjects. Estimates of two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the average log difference do not 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 77/121 
 
  
  
  
exceed -0.105 or 0.138 (corresponding to titre ratios of 0.78 and 1.37) and therefore meet an equivalence 
margin excluding larger that two-fold differences in post-vaccination titre between lots. In contrast to the 
results from an analysis of lot to lot consistency with regard to seroprotection, no confidence interval 
excludes 0 (i.e. no difference in post-vaccination titre between lots) 
The applicant initially claimed the following indication for MenQuadfi: “MenQuadfi is indicated for active 
primary and booster immunisation for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. MenQuadfi is indicated for use in individuals 12 months of age and 
older.” However, including the wording “primary and booster” immunisation was not considered appropriate. 
Some amendments were therefore required also to be consistent with both comparable quadrivalent 
meningococcal vaccines already approved in the EU (Menveo since 2010 and Nimenrix since 2012). The 
applicant proposed the new indication: “MenQuadfi is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from 
the age of 12 months and older, against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W, and Y.” This proposal was considered acceptable.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The paediatric population (older than 12 month of age) is part of the marketing authorization application. The 
presented respective studies are already assessed in other parts of the report. Please refer to the assessment 
of studies: 
MET51 for toddlers: 12-23 months 
MET35 for children: 2-9 years 
MET57 for toddlers 12-23 months 
MET54 toddlers 12-23 months 
Met32 toddlers of 12 months +- 21 days 
MET28 infants 2 months + 28 days and toddlers 12-<19months 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In all main clinical studies, the primary endpoints were met and non-inferior immunogenicity of MenQuadfi 30 
days after vaccination against different comparators across age groups was demonstrated for all serogroups 
in all age groups except for serogroup A in the subgroup of MenC-primed toddlers. Overall, immunogenicity 
of MenQuadfi across age groups has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
Important missing information is long-term persistence of immunogenicity beyond 30 days as well as the 
ability of MenQuadfi to boost itself, which will be addressed in the postmarketing studies, reflected in Annex 
II as category I post-marketing obligations.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
There was a total of 7116 subjects who received any formulation of MenACYW conjugate vaccine in the 
completed 11 clinical studies (209 subjects in the Phase I study, 1494 subjects in the Phase I/II and II 
studies, and 5413 subjects in the Phase III studies). 6398 subjects received a single dose of the final 
formulation of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (alone [5417 subjects] or with at least one concomitant vaccine 
[981 subjects]) in the 9 studies supporting the Summary of Clinical Safety.  
Of the 5417 subjects, there were 691 toddlers, 498 children 2 through 9 years, 1897 adolescents 10 through 
17 years, 1684 adults 18 through 55 years, 298 older adults 56 through 64 years, and 349 elderly adults 65 
years and older) receiving a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine given alone and included in the 
SafAS.

Adverse events 
Solicited Reactions 
Solicited Injection Site Reactions 
For toddlers 12 through 23 months of age, the percentage of subjects with solicited injection site reactions 
after meningococcal vaccine injection was comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 
the Nimenrix group (56.4% and 57.6%, respectively). The percentage of subjects with at least 1 Grade 3 
injection site reaction was low and comparable between the 2 groups (4.5% and 3.8%, respectively). The 
most commonly reported solicited injection site reactions were erythema and tenderness in both groups.

Table 27: Any and Grade 3 solicited injection site reaction after meningococcal vaccine injection, 
by maximum intensity during the solicited period – Toddlers (MET51, MET54) – Safety Analysis 
Set 
MenC-primed toddlers the frequency of solicited reactions tended to be higher in the MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine group (70.4%) compared to those who received Nimenrix (60.8%). While the rates are comparable 
in MenC-CRM primed toddlers between Nimenrix and MenQuadfi, in MenC-TT primed toddlers solicited 
reactions tend to be reported with higher frequency in the MenQuadfi group (66.9% vs 55.3%). The 
percentage of subjects experiencing any Grade 3 solicited injection site reaction or systemic reaction 
remained low after MenACYW conjugate vaccine (2.5% and 4.4%, respectively). The frequency of solicited 
reactions, particularly injection site reactions, tended to be lower in MenC-primed toddlers (70.4%) than in 
meningococcal vaccine-naïve toddlers (80.9%) after administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine. The 
same observation applied to subjects who had received Nimenrix (60.8% and 81.6%, respectively). There 
were no immediate AEs, no discontinuations due to an SAE or other AE, no deaths, and no related SAEs. One 
unrelated AESI was reported following administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine: this case corresponded 
to post-traumatic seizure (subject accidently fell of his cradle).

Table 28: Summary of solicited reactions within 7 days vaccine injection - Safety Analysis Set 
For children 2 through 9 years of age, the percentages of subjects reporting solicited injection site reactions 
tended to be lower in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (46.8%) than in the Menveo group (53.9%). 
There was a lower percentage of subjects in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group experiencing Grade 3 
injection site reactions (3.7%) compared to the Menveo group (11.1%). The same observations were made 
for children 2 to 5 years of age and for children 6 to 9 years of age. In addition, similar percentages of 
subjects reporting solicited injection site reactions were observed in children 2 to 5 years of age and in 
children 6 to 9 years of age following MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection. Pain was the most commonly 
reported solicited injection site reaction in children, followed by erythema, irrespective of the age group 
considered (2 through 9 years of age, 2 through 5 years of age, and 6 through 9 years of age).  
For adolescents 10 through 17 years of age, the percentages of subjects with solicited injection site 
reactions were comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (40.2%) and the corresponding 
comparator vaccine groups, Menactra (43.0%) and Menveo (45.7%). The percentage of subjects 
experiencing Grade 3 injection site reactions was low in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine, Menactra, and 
Menveo groups (1.8% to 2.2%). Pain was the most commonly reported solicited injection site reaction.  
For adults 18 through 55 years of age, the percentages of subjects with solicited injection site reactions 
were comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (43.4%) and Menactra group (43.7%). The 
percentage of subjects experiencing Grade 3 injection site reactions was low in both vaccine groups (2.1% 
and 2.2%). Pain was the most commonly reported solicited injection site reaction.  
In the older adults (56 through 64 years of age) and elderly adults (65 years of age and older) the 
percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction were higher in the MenACYW 
conjugate vaccine group compared to the Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group (38.0% versus 17.0% 
for older adults 56 through 64 years of age; 22.2% versus 11.8% for elderly adults 65 years of age and 
older). This difference was also observed in the 2 age subgroups, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years and above.

The observed rate at the MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection site tended to be lower when age increases 
(38.0%, 23.3%, and 18.9%, in older adults 56 through 64 years of age, in elderly 65 to 74 years, and in 
elderly 75 years and above, respectively). The observed rate of solicited injection site reactions in all the 
older adults and elderly adults was also lower than the rates observed in the younger age groups and only a 
low percentage of subjects reported a Grade 3 injection site reaction. Pain was the most commonly reported 
solicited injection site reaction irrespective of the age group considered (older adults 56 through 64 years of 
age, elderly 65 to 74 years, or elderly 75 years and above).

Solicited Systemic Reactions 
In the age group pool for toddlers 12 through 23 months of age, the percentage of subjects with solicited 
systemic reactions was comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (64.5%) and the 
Nimenrix group (62.9%). A low percentage of these subjects experienced at least 1 Grade 3 systemic 
reaction. The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were irritability followed by abnormal 
crying.

Table 30: Any and Grade 3 solicited systemic reactions after vaccine injection, by maximum 
intensity during the solicited period – Toddlers (MET51, MET54) – Safety Analysis Set 
In the age group of children 2 through 9 years of age, the percentages of subjects with solicited systemic 
reactions were comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (34.5%) and the Menveo group 
(37.0%). A low percentage of these subjects experienced at least 1 Grade 3 systemic reaction. The same 
observations were made in the age subgroups 2 to 5 years, and 6 to 9 years. Following MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine injection, the percentages of subjects with solicited systemic reactions was generally similar in 
subjects aged 2 to 5 years (30.9%) and in subjects aged 6 to 9 years (38.1%), except a higher frequency of 
headache in the 6 to 9 years age group compared to the 2 to 5 years age group (18.0% versus 7.0% of 
subjects). Of note, headache was also reported with a higher frequency in the 6 to 9 years age group 
compared to the 2 to 5 years age group following Menveo injection. The most commonly reported solicited 
systemic reactions were malaise and myalgia irrespective of the age group considered (2 through 9 years of 
age, 2 through 5 years of age, and 6 through 9 years of age). Headache was also frequently reported in the 6 
to 9 years age group.  
In the age group pool for adolescents 10 through 17 years of age, the percentages of subjects with solicited 
systemic reactions were largely comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (45.9%), the 
Menactra group (50.1%), and the Menveo group (51.0%). A low percentage of these subjects experienced at 
least 1 Grade 3 systemic reaction. The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were myalgia 
and headache followed by malaise. 
In the age group pool for adults 18 through 55 years of age, the percentages of subjects with solicited 
systemic reactions were similar in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (47.6%) and in the Menactra group 
(47.9%); the percentages of subjects with at least 1 Grade 3 systemic reaction were the same in both groups

(5.7%). The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were myalgia and headache, followed by 
malaise. 
In the pool of older adults 56 through 64 years of age, the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 
solicited systemic reaction was higher in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (42.5%) compared to the 
Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group (29.6%). There were a low percentage of subjects experiencing at 
least 1 Grade 3 systemic reactions in both groups. The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions 
were myalgia and headache, followed by malaise.  
In the pool of elderly adults aged 65 years of age and above, the percentages of subjects with solicited 
systemic reactions were largely comparable in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (30.5%), and in the 
Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group (25.3%). This was also observed in the age subgroups 65 to 74 
years and 75 years and above. There was a low percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1 Grade 3 
systemic reaction in both vaccine groups. Similar percentages of subjects reporting solicited systemic 
reactions were observed in elderly adults aged 65 to 74 years and in elderly adults aged 75 years and above 
following MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection. The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions 
were myalgia and headache, followed by malaise in the pool of elderly adults aged 65 years and above, and 
in elderly adults aged 65 to 74 years. In the elderly adults aged 75 years and above, the most commonly 
reported solicited systemic reactions following MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection were myalgia and 
malaise, followed by headache.

Non-Serious Unsolicited Adverse Events and Reactions 
Immediate Non-Serious Adverse Events 
Very few immediate adverse events were observed within 30 minutes after vaccination. None were observed 
in toddlers, children, older adults 56 through 64 years, and one event in elderly adults 65 years of age 
and older (dysgeusia).  
In adolescents, the percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 immediate unsolicited AE assessed as related 
to vaccination (ie, immediate unsolicited AR) was 0.4% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group, 0.0% in 
the Menactra group, and 0.2% in the Menveo vaccine group. The most commonly reported immediate 
unsolicited AR was dizziness (5 subjects; 0.3%) in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group.  
In adults 18 through 55 years, the percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 immediate unsolicited AR 
following vaccine injection was low (0.2% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine and Menactra vaccine groups). 
The most commonly reported immediate unsolicited AR was dizziness (3 subjects [0.2%] in the MenACYW 
conjugate vaccine group and 1 subject [0.2%] in the Menactra vaccine group). No safety concerns were 
identified from the review of these reports. 
Unsolicited Non-Serious Adverse Events 
The percentages of subjects in each age group reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AE were 
comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and the corresponding comparator vaccine 
groups.  
Unsolicited Reactions 
The percentages of toddlers reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR within 30 days of vaccination 
were low and comparable between both vaccine groups (5.0% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 
4.5% in the Nimenrix vaccine group). The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious AR in both groups 
was diarrhea. Overall, most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity, most 
started and resolved within 3 days of vaccination. There were no subjects with Grade 3 unsolicited non-
serious ARs within 30 days of vaccination in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group. 
The percentages of children 2 through 9 years of age reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR within 
30 days of vaccination were low and comparable between both vaccine groups (2.0% in the MenACYW 
conjugate vaccine group and 3.4% in the Menveo vaccine group). The most frequently reported unsolicited 
non-serious ARs in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group were vomiting, and abdominal pain (upper) for 
subjects 2 through 5 years of age, and injection site bruising for subjects 6 through 9 years of age. Overall, 
most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity, most started and resolved 
within 3 days of vaccination. One subject in each group (0.2%) reported a Grade 3 non-serious AR within 30 
days of vaccination. 
The percentages of adolescents with at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR were comparable between the 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine, Menactra, and Menveo groups: 3.1%, 1.3%, and 3.4%, respectively. The most 
frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs included injection site pruritus, injection site warmth, 
dizziness, and nausea. Overall, the majority of unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 
intensity, most started and resolved within 3 days of vaccination. There was a low proportion (≤ 1.3%) of 
subjects experiencing Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious ARs within 30 days of vaccination across all vaccine 
groups. 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 86/121 
 
  
  
  
In adults 18 through 55 years of age the percentages of adults reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-
serious AR within 30 days of vaccination were low and comparable between MenACYW conjugate vaccine 
group (2.2%) and the Menactra group (2.4%). The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs 
were injection site pruritus and injection site warmth (at the MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection site), 
fatigue, nausea, and dizziness. Overall, most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 
intensity, most started and resolved within 3 days of vaccination. There was a low proportion (≤ 0.6%) of 
subjects experiencing Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious ARs within 30 days of vaccination in both the vaccine 
groups.  
In older adults 56 through 64 years of age the percentages of older adults reporting at least 1 unsolicited 
non-serious AR within 30 days of vaccination were low: 3.4% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 
1.6% in the Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 group. The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs 
were injection site pruritus (at the MenACYW conjugate vaccine site), injection site bruising (at the 
Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 site), and fatigue. Overall, most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 
1 or Grade 2 intensity, most started and resolved within 3 days of vaccination. There was a low proportion 
(0.3%) of older adults experiencing Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious ARs within 30 days of vaccination in the 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine group.  
In elderly adults 65 years of age and older the percentages of elderly adults with at least 1 unsolicited 
non-serious AR were low in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (5.2%) and the Menomune − A/C/Y/W-
135 vaccine group (2.6%). The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs was injection site 
pruritus (2.3% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.7% in the Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 group). 
Overall, most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity, most started and 
resolved within 3 days of vaccination. There was only 1 subject (0.3%) in the Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 
group and no subjects in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group who experienced a Grade 3 unsolicited non-
serious AR within 30 days of vaccination. 
Concomitant vaccines 
A total of 392 adolescents received a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered concomitantly 
with Tdap + HPV in Study MET50, and 296 adolescents received Tdap + HPV alone.   
A total of 589 toddlers received a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered concomitantly 
with a licensed paediatric vaccine (MMR + V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13) in Study MET57, and 294 toddlers 
received MMR + V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13 vaccines alone. 
Solicited Reactions  
In toddlers, the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction at any 
vaccination site within 7 days post-vaccination were comparable when MMR + V or DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccines 
were given with or without MenACYW conjugate vaccine. This percentage was higher in subjects who 
received PCV13 concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine (31.5%) compared to subjects who received 
PCV13 without MenACYW conjugate vaccine (13.1%). Grade 3 injection site reactions were reported at a 
similar frequency in subjects who received the concomitant vaccines with or without MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine.

Table 33: Solicited systemic reactions after vaccine injection(s), by maximum intensity during the 
solicited period – Toddlers– Safety Analysis Set (MET51, MET54 and MET57) 
The percentages of adolescents who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction were comparable 
between subjects who received the licensed Tdap and HPV vaccines with or without MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine (84.5% and 82.4%, respectively). At the MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection site, the percentages 
of subjects were higher in subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine concomitantly with Tdap and 
HPV (49.0%) versus subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone (40.2%). Also Grade 3 
injection site reactions at the MenACYW conjugate vaccine site were slightly higher in subjects who received 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine concomitantly with Tdap and HPV (2.8%) as compared to subjects who received 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone (1.8%). Pain was the most common solicited injection site reaction for 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine, Tdap, and HPV vaccines in both groups, with 2.3% of subjects who experienced 
Grade 3 injection site pain for MenACYW conjugate vaccine.   
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 89/121 
 
  
  
  
 
 
The percentage of adolescent subjects who reported at least 1 solicited systemic reaction were higher in 
subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine concomitantly with Tdap and HPV (70.6%) versus 
subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone (45.9%) and slightly higher versus subjects who 
received Tdap and HPV alone (65.9%). Slightly more subjects reported at least 1 Grade 3 systemic reaction 
in the MenACYW+ Tdap + HPV (7.5%) compared to the Tdap + HPV vaccine groups (5.5%) or the MenACYW 
alone group (4%). Myalgia was the most commonly reported solicited systemic reaction, followed by 
headache and malaise. 
Unsolicited Non-Serious Adverse Reactions  
In toddlers 12 to 23 months of age, the percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 unsolicited non-
serious AR was low when MMR + V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13 vaccines were given concomitantly with or 
without MenACYW conjugate vaccine (≤ 2.1%). 
The percentage of adolescents reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR were slightly higher when 
Tdap and HPV were given concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine than when Tdap and HPV were 
given without MenACYW conjugate vaccine (8.7% and 4.1%, respectively) or when MenACYW was given 
alone (3.1%). The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs were injection site pruritus, injection 
site bruising, nausea, and vomiting, which also occurred more frequently in the MenACYW/Tdap/HPV group 
compared to Tday/HPV given alone (except injection site bruising). The frequency of reported Grade 3 
unsolicited non serious ARs increased when subjects were concomitantly vaccinated with HPV and Tdap 
(1.3%) and were also higher when compared to HPV+Tdap alone (0%). In particular grade 3 nausea and 
vomiting were more frequently reported when MenACYW was administered with Tdap+HPV (0.5% each, 
versus 0% for MenACYW alone). Dizziness was not reported more frequently than when MenACYW was 
vaccinated alone. The unsolicited non serious AR tended to be of longer duration when MenACYW was 
concomitantly administered with Tdap+HPV compared to Tdap and HPV alone (4-7days: 1.8% versus 0%, 8 
days and more 0.8% versus 0.3%). 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
There were no deaths in subjects who received the MenACYW conjugate vaccine.  
Serious Adverse Events 
In each age group, the rates of SAEs were comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 
the corresponding comparative control groups: 
In toddlers: 0.8% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.3% in the Nimenrix vaccine group 
between D0 and D30; and none in any group from D31 to the end of the study. 
In children: 0.4% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.2% in the Menveo vaccine group between 
D0 and D30; and 1.0% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.4% in the Menveo vaccine group 
from D31 to the end of the study. 
In adolescents: 0.2% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group, 0.0% in the Menactra group, 0.2% in the 
Menveo group between D0 and D30; and 0.4% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group, 0.6% in the 
Menactra group, and 0.6% in the Menveo group from D31 to the end of the study. 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 90/121 
 
  
  
  
In adults 18 through 55 years of age: 0.2% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.4% in the 
Menactra vaccine group between D0 and D30; and 1.4% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.6% 
in the Menactra vaccine group from D31 to the end of the study. 
In older adults 56 through 64 years of age: 0.3% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.8% in the 
Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group between D0 and D30; and 1.3%in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine 
group and 1.6% in the Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group from D31 to the end of the study. 
In elderly adults ≥ 65 years of age: 0.6% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.3%in the 
Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group between D0 and D30; and 2.3% in the MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine group and 3.0% in the Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group from D31 to the end of the study. 
None were considered related to MenACYW vaccination by the Sponsor or Investigator. All SAEs were 
collected up to D30 in studies MET44, MET51, MET54, and MET57, while in studies MET35, MET50, MET43, 
MET49, and MET56, SAEs were collected up to 6-month after vaccination. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
A total of 5 AESIs were reported in subjects from the active-controlled studies included in the integrated 
analysis and all corresponded to reports of seizures: 4 (N=5417) were reported in subjects who received 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone and 1 (N=2990) was reported in a subject who received a comparator 
vaccine. None of the AESIs were considered related to study vaccination by the Investigator or Sponsor or 
reported within 7 days of vaccination. In subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone, AESIs 
were reported in one toddler (febrile convulsion), 1 adolescent (seizure), and 2 adults (status epilepticus and 
seizure). Temporal relationship for the febrile seizure case was inconsistent with causal association with 
vaccination. The other reports of seizures were confounded by the subject’s underlying condition or had an 
alternative cause. 
There were no reports of Kawasaki disease, GBS, or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in any of the 
studies among the subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine or a comparator vaccine. As stated by 
the applicant, no confirmed cases of GBS occurred within 6 weeks after vaccination (this window is a 
commonly used post-vaccination period which may be consistent with vaccine associated GBS). However, 
subjects in Studies MET44, MET51, MET54 and MET57 were only observed for 30 days after vaccination. 
Concomitant vaccines 
SAEs and AESIs 
In toddlers, the percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 SAE was low when MMR + V, DTaP-IPV-HB-
Hib, or PCV13 vaccines were given concomitantly with or without MenACYW conjugate vaccine (≤ 3.2%). 
None of the SAEs were assessed as related to study vaccination and no deaths were reported. No AESIs were 
reported when MenACYW conjugate vaccine was given concomitantly with MMR + V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or 
PCV13 vaccines. One unrelated AESI (febrile convulsion) was reported 22 days after vaccination with DTaP-
IPV-HB-Hib vaccine alone. 
In adolescents, the percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 SAE during the study was low and 
comparable when Tdap and HPV vaccines were given concomitantly with or without MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine (1.0% and 1.4%, respectively). None were assessed as related to study vaccination either by the 
Investigator or Sponsor and no deaths were reported.  
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 91/121 
 
  
  
  
One subject reported an unrelated AESI (Grand Mal seizure) following administration of MenACYW conjugate 
vaccine with Tdap and HPV vaccines. The case was confounded by the subject’s underlying condition (history 
of autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and seizure disorder treated with carbamazepine). 
Laboratory findings 
Neither of the studies included safety laboratory evaluations as part of routine study procedures for the 
safety evaluation of MenACYW.

MET57 
Intrinsic Factors 
No apparent differences were observed in the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to the 
licensed vaccines when race and gender were considered.  
The higher rates of solicited injection site reactions, including Grade 3 reactions, in toddlers and children are 
possibly confounded by the intensity scale used in these age groups. In these age groups, erythema/and 
swelling were of Grade 3 severity when above 5 cm while in the older age group they were of Grade 3 when 
above 10 cm. Also, in toddlers and children any erythema/ and swelling were collected and considered as 
injection site reaction; while in the other age groups, measurement had to be above 2.5 cm to be considered 
in the analysis. Overall, the rates were comparable between adolescents, adults, and older adults.  
In elderly, a lower local and systemic reactogenicity was noted compared to the younger age groups; while 
the rate of SAEs was higher (as expected and remained comparable to that of Menomune − A/C/Y/W-135 
vaccine). 
Extrinsic Factors 
No clinical outcome data associated with extrinsic factors (eg, the use of tobacco or alcohol and food habits) 
have been collected in the studies included in the clinical development program. The potential interaction of 
extrinsic factors is not expected with vaccines. 
Pregnancies during the studies 
The following is the distribution of the 12 pregnancies reported in subjects who had received MenACYW 
conjugate vaccine): 
- 7 unexposed 
- 4 exposed, but not yet pregnant (injection received during the interval between 30 days before her last 
menstrual period (LMP) and 7 days after her LMP) 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 93/121 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
- 1 exposed and pregnant (injection received 7 days after her LMP) 
Table 35: MenACYW conjugate vaccine pregnancy exposure and pregnancy outcomes 
No cases of congenital abnormalities were reported in either category of exposed pregnancies.  
Immunological events 
No specific analyses were provided, and evaluation of immunological events was part of the safety and 
efficacy documentation above. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Vaccination in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment may not elicit an adequate immune response.  
Data on concomitant administration with other vaccines is integrated in the safety documentation above 
(MMR [M-M-RII], V [VARIVAX], DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib [Hexaxim/Hexyon/Hexacima], and PCV13 [Prevenar 
13/Prevnar 13 were investigated in toddlers and Tdap [Adacel/Covaxis] and HPV [Gardasil] in adolescents). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One subject experienced an AE that led to discontinuation among the MenACYW conjugate vaccine recipients. 
The parents of subject 301-05001, an 18-month old male, withdrew their consent due to a nonserious Grade 
2 AE (Gastroenteritis) experienced by the subject on D0, and lasted 5 days after receiving MenACYW 
conjugate vaccine administered alone in study MET57. The event was considered as not related to the 
vaccine by the Investigator and Sponsor. The subject was treated and recovered from the event. 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available for MenACYW conjugate vaccine as the vaccine is not yet marketed in 
any country.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of one dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (MenQuadfi) was evaluated in subjects aged 12 
months and older (toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults including those 56 years and older). The safety 
was evaluated descriptively in eleven clinical trials: two phase I/II studies for selection of the final 
formulation and nine pivotal phase II/III studies investigating the to be marketed formulation. The safety 
profile of MenACYW was compared to the currently available and well characterised MCV4 vaccines Menveo 
and Menactra (in children 2-9 years, adolescents 10-17 years and adults 18-55years) and Nimenrix (in 
toddlers) as well as to the no longer available, unconjugated vaccine Menomune (in older adults; 56 years 
and older).  
An integrated safety summary, summarised by age category and vaccine type, formed the basis of this full 
application, which was acceptable based on the similar design and conduct of the studies. MenC primed 
toddlers from Study MET51 were excluded from the integrated/pooled safety analysis, which was also 
acceptable based on different rates of solicited reactions, different number of MenC priming doses and time 
point of priming up to one month before study vaccination. Of note, MCV-4 primed subjects from study 
MET56 were included in the integrated analysis as priming occurred at least 4 to 10 years prior to study 
vaccination.     
As regards the different types of vaccines used in children, adolescents and adults, it should be noted that 
only Menveo is an EU-licensed vaccine (Menactra and Menomune are US-licensed). Overall, 995 subjects 
received Menveo, among which 494 were children 2-9 years of age and 501 were adolescents 10-17 years of 
age, but none were adults. No concern was however raised on the use of only non EU-licensed comparator 
vaccines in adults for the following reasons: The two conjugated vaccines Menveo and Menactra are expected 
to show largely comparable safety profiles (despite containing a different amount of antigen and different 
carrier proteins). Indeed, only small differences in the safety profiles were observed between the different 
treatment arms that were considered not to influence the benefit risk conclusion (see results below). Further, 
adolescents and adults were expected to show comparable safety profiles based on mechanistic 
considerations, which was supported by the results (see also below). The unconjugated Menomune vaccine, 
however, has a lower reactogenicity potential than the other, more comparable, conjugated vaccines. Hence, 
the established safety profile in older adults (above 56 years of age) could only be indirectly compared to the 
safety profile observed in MenACYW vaccinated younger adults. Reassuringly, however, elderly overall 
reported less frequently AEs compared to younger adults (see below). Importantly, the safety assessments 
were considered appropriate and sufficiently similar across studies to allow pooling of the results by age 
group and by vaccine type. Therefore, a within treatment-group comparison by age group for the pooled 
MenACYW anaylsis as well as the between-treatment group comparison of MenACYW to Menveo and 
Menactra within the ISS was overall sufficient.  
The overall safety database of MenACYW consists of 7116 subjects. 6398 subjects received the final 
MenACYW formulation in the 9 pivotal studies included in the safety analysis, thereof 5417 alone and 981 
subjects with a concomitant vaccine. Out of the 5417 subjects exposed to MenACYW, there were 691 
toddlers, 492 children (2 through 9 years), 1897 adolescents, 1684 adults, 298 older adults (56 to 64 years), 
and 349 elderly adults (65 years and above). The overall safety database fulfils the recommendations as set 
out in the Guideline for Vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005) and was considered acceptable to support 
registration of MenQuadfi. 
Safety analysis was stratified by age, gender and race. The demographic and baseline characteristics were 
generally comparable between vaccine groups. In toddlers there were more male (56.2%) than female 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 95/121 
 
  
  
  
(43.8%) subjects in the MenACYW group. Most of the study subjects were white and not Hispanic or Latino, 
the number of subjects belonging to racial groups other than white (roughly 80%) or black/African American 
(roughly 10 to 20%) were underrepresented in the studies.  
The method for safety collection was comparable across all studies and was in line with the EMA guideline on 
clinical evaluation of vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 Rev. 1), although different duration of follow up 
in the studies were reported. Immediate unsolicited adverse reactions were collected within 30 minutes after 
the vaccine injection. A diary card was used to collect all information about solicited reactions (injection site: 
pain, erythema, swelling, redness; systemic: fever, headache, myalgia, malaise) from D0 to D7 after 
vaccination and about unsolicited AEs/ARs (including medically attended adverse events; MAAEs) from Day 0 
to Day 30 (Visit 2; V02). Serious AEs and MAAEs were collected during the entire study (1-month follow-up 
for studies MET 44, MET 51, and MET 54; 6 months- follow-up for studies MET 35, MET 43, MET 49, MET 50, 
Met 56). Adverse events of special interest (generalized seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Kawasaki disease 
and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) were prospectively collected in toddlers in studies MET 35 and MET 
51 and for other studies retrieved based on MedDRA coding. 
Concomitant medications that might have influenced the study results were recorded in each study and 
summarized per Category (per study and vaccine arm). No notable differences were observed between study 
groups within the different studies. 
The MedDRA coding version was updated during the course of the trials and the same version of MedDRA was 
not used to code AEs in all studies. Although the applicant was asked to indicate how the changes affected 
the tabulations, no details on the changes between different MedDRA versions were provided. The provided 
data in the pooled analysis include the solicited, unsolicited non-serious and serious AEs/ARs among all 
studies and all age groups, re-coded according to the last MedDRA version (21.0) available at that time. 
The safety profile was comparable to the currently available EU- or US-licensed MCV4 vaccines Menveo, 
Menactra, and Nimenrix. The age cut-off used for older adults (56 years) was justified as since, at the time of 
study conduct, Menomune was the only licensed vaccine in the older age group 56 years and older in the US. 
As expected, in older adults, Menomune vaccinated subjects showed a less reactogenic profile than MenACYW 
vaccinated subjects. In particular, solicited ARs were reported less frequently in older (56 years and above) 
compared to younger adults (18 to 55 years), while a larger proportion of older adults reported unsolicited 
(injection site) ARs. These differences were reflected in the SmPC. The frequency of reported immediate 
unsolicited ARs (within 30 minutes after vaccination) was low in all age cohorts: no immediate AEs were 
reported in toddlers and children, while in adolescents 0.4% (7/1987), in adults 18-55 years 0.2% (4/1684) 
and in older adults 0.2% (1/647) of subjects reported immediate ARs in the MenACYW arm. These were 
mostly driven by dizziness. Dizziness was considered related and is reflected in the SmPC. There were no 
serious immediate unsolicited ARs (including any anaphylactic or life-threatening events.) 
Solicited ARs within 7 days:  
In toddlers, overall, solicited injection site reactions were reported by 56.4% of subjects in the MenACYW 
group and comparable to the Nimenrix group. The most reported local reactions were erythema (38.0%) and 
tenderness (37.8%), followed by swelling (19.4%). The number of Grade 3 reactions was low (4.5%) and 
comparable to Nimenrix. 
Safety of 305 MenC primed toddlers was not included in the integrated safety analysis and presented 
separately. Compared to meningococcal vaccine naïve toddlers, solicited reactions tended to be reported with 
lower frequency in MenC-primed toddlers after the administration of MenACYW (70.4 vs 80.9%) or Nimenrix 
(60.8 vs 81.6%). In MenC-primed toddlers, solicited reactions, especially solicited injection site reactions, 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 96/121 
 
  
  
  
tended to be reported with higher frequency in toddlers vaccinated with MenACYW conjugate vaccine as 
compared to toddlers vaccinated with Nimenrix. This was still in an acceptable range. While the rates are 
comparable in MenC-CRM primed toddlers between Nimenrix and MenQuadfi, in MenC-TT primed toddlers 
solicited reactions tend to be reported with higher frequency in the MenQuadfi group (66.9% vs 55.3%). 
Although the point estimate for solicited injection site reactions and systemic reactions tended to be higher in 
the MenACYW group, no statistical significance was reached, and the intensity of the reactions were mostly 
Grade 1.  
In children, 46.8% of subjects reported solicited injection site reactions which was comparable to Menveo. 
Pain was reported most commonly (38.6%) followed by erythema (22.6%) and swelling (13.8%). Most of the 
reported solicited events were of grade 1 and 2, while the number of Grade 3 reactions for solicited events 
was lower in the MenACYW group compared to Menveo (3.7 % vs 11.1% respectively). 
In adolescents and adults, the percentages of subjects reporting solicited injection site reactions 
following MenACYW vaccination were comparable (any intensity: 40.2% and 43.4%, respectively; Grade 3: 
1.8% and 2.1%, respectively). Pain was most commonly reported (38.3% resp. 42.7%), followed by 
erythema (4.8% resp. 5%) and swelling (4.4 % resp. 4.3%). These events occurred mostly in the three days 
after the vaccination, were mainly of Grade 1 or 2 and there were no significant differences compared to 
Menactra or Menveo (including Grade 3 events).  
A comparable percentage of older adults 56 to 64 years of age reported solicited injection site ARs 
(38%; grade 3: 1.7%). As for adolescents and adults 18-55 years, pain was reported most commonly 
(35.6%), followed by erythema (8.8%) and swelling (7.1%). These ARs were mostly grade 1 or 2 and most 
resolved within 3 days. In elderly subjects (65 years and above), injection site reactions were less 
frequently reported in the MenACYW group (22.2%, grade 3 0.9%) compared to older adults: pain 19.9%, 
erythema 5.8% and swelling: 4%.  
Solicited systemic ARs:  
In toddlers, overall, 64.5% reported solicited systemic reactions, which was comparable to the Nimenrix 
group. Irritability was most commonly reported (48.6%), followed by abnormal crying (34.5%), appetite lost 
(28.2%), and drowsiness (24.2%) with a similar pattern in the Nimenrix group. Most of the reactions were 
Grade 1 and 2, number of Grade 3 reactions was low and comparable (4.3% in both groups). 
In children, 34.5% of subjects reported solicited systemic reactions, which was comparable to the Menveo 
group. Malaise was most commonly reported (21.1%) followed by myalgia (20.1%) and headache (12.5%). 
Most reactions were of grade 1 and 2 intensity, while the number of Grade 3 reactions was low (1.8%) and 
comparable to Menveo. 
In adolescents and adults, 45.9% and 47.6%, respectively, reported solicited systemic ARs. Myalgia was 
most commonly reported (by 30.5% resp. 35.8 % of subjects) followed by headache (28.8% resp. 30%) and 
malaise (21.7% resp. 23.9%). Fever was reported by 0.8% and 1.2% of MenACYW vaccinated subjects, 
respectively. Most reactions occurred and resolved within the first days and were mostly Grade 1 and 2. 
Grade 3 reactions were overall low (4% resp. 5.7%, lowest for fever). There were no significant differences 
to the comparator arms Menveo or Menactra. 
A comparable percentage of older adults 56-64 years reported solicited systemic ARs (42.5%; grade 3, 
2.4%), while in elderly subjects, these were reported less frequently (30.5%; grade 3, 1.4%). Otherwise, 
the pattern was similar (most commonly myalgia, followed by headache and malaise, fever less frequently).  
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

The reported local and systemic reactions were consistent with those expected after vaccine administration 
and are adequately reflected in SmPC section 4.8   
Unsolicited AEs and ARs (within 30 days): In toddlers 54.7% of subjects reported at least 1 unsolicited non-
serious AE, which was comparable to Nimenrix. The number of unsolicited adverse reactions was low (5%, no 
Grade 3). Most of the reported reactions belong to the SOC ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ with diarrhoea 
reported by 2.3% of subjects in the MenACYW conjugate group. Other preferred terms were mostly reported 
as single cases.  
In children 23.9% reported unsolicited non-serious AEs, which was comparable to the Menveo group. The 
percentage of subjects reporting unsolicited non-serious ARs was low (2%). Most of the reported reactions 
belong to the SOC ‘General Disorders and administration site conditions’ with reports of injections site 
bruising, crying and injection site warmth among others.  Beside ‘Gastrointestinal Disorders’ including 
vomiting, upper abdominal pain and nausea, other preferred terms were reported as single cases. Most of the 
ARs were grade 1 or 2, 1 subject in each vaccine group (0.2%) experienced at least 1 Grade 3 unsolicited 
non-serious AR within 30 days of vaccine injection. Overall MenACYW and Menveo groups were comparable.  
For adolescents and adults 18-55 years, 19.2% of adolescents and 12.7% of adults 18-55 years reported 
at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AE in the MenACYW group, which was comparable to Menveo or Menactra. 
The percentages of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR (by SOC and PT) were low and 
similar for adolescents and adults (in the MenACYW arm 3.1% and 2.2%, respectively). This was also 
comparable to the comparator arms (Menveo or Menactra). The most frequently reported ARs were in the 
SOC ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ and were most frequently ‘injection site pruritus’ 
and ‘injection site warmth’, followed by ‘dizziness’ and ‘nausea’ in adolescents and ‘fatigue’ in adults. The 
unsolicited non-serious ARs were mostly Grade 1 or 2 and mostly resolved within 3 days. Grade 3 unsolicited 
non-serious ARs were reported in a very low number of patients (<0.1% and 0.2%, in adolescents and 
adults, respectively, in the MenACYW arm).  
In older adults 56-64 years, the percentages of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR 
within 30 days of vaccination was comparable to adolescents/adults in the MenACYW group (3.4%). 
Similarly, the most frequently reported ARs were from the SOC ‘general disorders and administration site 
conditions’ (2.7% in the MenACYW arm) and mostly injection site pruritus (2%). Dizziness was not reported, 
and neither were nausea or vomitus. Only one grade 3 unsolicited non-serious AR (0.3%) was reported for 
the MenACYW group (i.e. chills). 
In contrast, in elderly subjects (aged 65 years and older), slightly more subjects reported at least 1 
unsolicited non-serious AR within 30 days of vaccine injection (5.2%) compared to the ‘older adults’ (3.4%) 
in the MenACYW group, respectively. As for the older adults, this was driven by the SOC ‘General disorders 
and administration site conditions’ (most frequently ‘injection site pruritus’). Most unsolicited non serious ARs 
were of Grade 1 or 2 and most resolved within 3 days after the injection. No subject experienced Grade 3 
unsolicited AR in the MenACYW group. 
The tabulated summary of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated during the last round 
with the removal of the use of any threshold of frequency of occurrence of adverse reactions, thereby now 
also including AR’s that were rarely (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) observed. Yet, the tabulated summary had 
previously already been outlined to show AR’s occurring with a frequency of at least 0.1% (including only 
very common, common and uncommon AR’s). The applicant explained the discrepancies and provided 
enough justification. All adverse reactions which were considered related to vaccination with a reasonable 
possibility were included, i.e. also including unsolicited adverse reactions or MAAEs considered related to 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 98/121 
 
  
  
  
vaccination (e.g. urticaria, pruritus, rash,; for the complete list see related SmpC comment). The applicant 
clarified how the frequencies were calculated.  
Serious AEs:  
There were no deaths reported in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group. 
Overall, the incidence of SAEs was low and comparable between MenACYW and the corresponding active 
control vaccine group: 0.8% of toddlers, 1% of children (mostly single cases in the SOC ‘Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders’), 0.5% of adolescents (with comparable results for the concomitant 
vaccination groups, i.e. 1.0% and 1.4% for Tdap + HPV with and without MenACYW, respectively) and 1.6% 
of adults reported at least 1 SAE. These were mostly single cases with no evident pattern. None of these 
events were considered related by the investigator or sponsor. The narratives were provided and there is no 
indication of a causal relationship to the vaccine in any age group. The applicant was asked to discuss the 
different duration of follow up in the different studies and justify why safety data (especially SAES and AESIs) 
in toddlers were not collected for a 6-month period after vaccination. Difference in safety follow up duration 
were only based on the standard requirements for the US conducted studies. In all other studies safety 
endpoints were followed for 30 days; MAAEs and SAEs were followed up till end of 6 months post vaccination.   
The number of AESIs that might potentially have been associated with MenACYW vaccination was low across 
the clinical development programme with reports in 4 subjects who received the MenACYW vaccine (febrile 
convulsion, temporal partial seizure). None of the events was considered as related, which is acknowledged. 
As stated by the applicant, no confirmed cases of GBS occurred within 6 weeks after vaccination (this window 
is a commonly used post-vaccination period which may be consistent with vaccine associated GBS). Subjects 
in Studies MET44, MET51, MET54 and MET57 were only observed for 30 days after vaccination. GBS should 
be included as a safety concern for the PSURs, but not the RMP. 
No significant differences for MAAEs between treatment arms were noted in the individual studies. However, 
since some of these MAAEs were considered related to treatment by the investigator, the applicant was asked 
to provide listings, summarized by treatment and study, of those MAAEs that were considered related to the 
vaccination and discuss in how far they needed to be reflected in the SmPC . These MAAEs were summarised 
and the applicant clarified that the nature and frequency of those events were similar to the unsolicited 
adverse events and that therefore no particular advice should be added to the SmPC.  
MCV4- primed subjects (aged 15 years and older) showed no notable differences to MCV4-vaccine naïve 
subjects (slightly more solicited injection site and systemic reactions in MC4-primed subjects [<10% 
difference in proportion of subjects], but no difference in grade 3 solicited ARs, unsolicited ARs or MAEEs).  
Concomitant vaccines:  
In study MET57 the safety profile of MenACYW was evaluated in toddlers with concomitant 
administration of different vaccines, including either DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, MMR+V or PCV13. The frequency 
of reported AEs (solicited and unsolicited events) was in general lower, especially in Russian study sites 
where PCV13 was used as concomitant vaccine, than in studies MET51 and MET54 conducted in the EU, in 
the same age group. As there were fewer reports from the Russian study sites it is difficult to compare the 
results of the concomitant vaccines. The applicant discussed possible reasons for the low frequency of 
reported AEs in study MET57 and provided arguments, including a comparable low frequency across different 
study sites in Russia, possible influence by genotypic/phenotypic profiles and the cultural differences in 
medical practice in the Russian Federation against underreporting.  
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 99/121 
 
  
  
  
Percentage of subjects reporting at least one injection site reaction or systemic reaction at the MenACYW 
injection site was comparable between the groups receiving MenACYW alone or in combination with either 
MMR+V or DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib (46.3%, 40.7 % and 44.5% and 54%, 46.6% and 51.3%, respectively). In 
subjects who received MenACYW + PCV13 the number was lower with 26.0% and 20%. Reporting of injection 
site reactions at any vaccine injection site was comparable with slight differences with or without MenACYW. 
In the PCV13 + MenACYW group the percentage was higher (31.5%) than in PCV13 alone (13.1%). Although 
the reports of injection site reactions and systemic reactions tended to be higher when PCV13 was 
administered in combination with MenACYW than PCV13 alone, the corresponding 95% CI were overlapping 
and the overall numbers with PCV13 were lower than in combination with other vaccines. 
Tdap and HPV (adolescents): When MenACYW was concomitantly administered with Tdap and HPV 
vaccines, more adverse reactions were reported (including grade 3): approximately 10% and 25% more 
subjects reported solicited injection site and systemic reactions, respectively, compared to MenACYW alone 
(driven by myalgia and fever). Unsolicited ARs were also more frequently reported, especially injection site 
pruritus, injection site bruising, nausea and vomiting (still remained low, below 2%), and were of longer 
duration. When compared to vaccination of Tdap and HPV alone, solicited systemic (61.3 versus 55.4%) and 
unsolicited ARs (8.5 versus 4.1%) tended to be more frequently reported with the vaccination of the three 
components. 
Although concomitant vaccination was tolerated without unexpected or serious safety concerns, more 
adverse reactions are generally to be expected with concomitant vaccination. The higher rates of adverse 
reactions in toddlers who received PCV13 given conconmitantly with MenQuadfi than in toddlers who received 
PCV13 alone was reflected in the SmPC. 
Pregnancy and lactation:  
Concerning  the  use  of  the  product  during  pregnancy  and  lactation,  data  is  very  limited.  Despite  pregnancy 
being an exclusion criterion, 12 pregnancies were reported, of which one was considered ‘exposed to the study 
vaccine  when  pregnant’,  four  ‘exposed  when  not  pregnant’  and  seven  as  ‘not  exposed’.  No  pregnancy 
complications  or  cases  of  congenital  abnormalities  were  reported  in  either  category.  Experience  with  the 
product from pregnant women is however limited, and women in their childbearing years will potentially receive 
the  vaccine.  The  applicant  will  establish  a  pregnancy  registry  in  the  US  to  collect  data  on  the  outcome  of 
exposure  during  pregnancy  and  to  monitor  for  any  potential  safety  signals  that  may  arise.  ‘Use  during 
pregnancy’  was  included  as  missing  information  in  the  RMP  and  the  pregnancy  registry  was  included  as  a 
Category 3 study in the PhV plan of the RMP. The applicant has committed to submit the final protocol of the 
pregnancy registry (MEQ00070) to the EMA in a next RMP update or in a stand-alone procedure. The applicant 
has also commited to provide a discussion on alternative EU data sources in case a signal is raised from the 
pregnancy registry or spontaneous reported data. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The nature and frequency of the reported adverse events are considered to be consistent with those expected 
after vaccine administration, are comparable as observed with the comparator vaccines and do not give rise 
to concern. 
In conclusion, the safety profile of MenQuadfi is considered acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication: 
“MenQuadfi is indicated for active primary and booster immunisation for the prevention of invasive 
meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. MenQuadfi is indicated 
for use in individuals 12 months of age and older. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with available official recommendations.” 
The virulence of Neisseria meningitides is mostly based on the biochemical structure of capsular 
polysaccharides. So far 12 distinct meningococcal serogroups have been classified, with serogroups A, B, C, 
W, X and Y being responsible for most cases of meningococcal disease. Dynamics of meningococcal 
transmission, acquisition, and carriage in humans are a major influence on the incidence and likelihood of 
meningococcal disease and vary world-wide greatly among regions. The European population is mostly 
affected by serogroup B, but also C and Y have been reported. At present, the best prevention known against 
meningococcal disease is the up-front immunization with vaccines targeting the relevant serogroups. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Meningococcal vaccines induce the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular 
polysaccharides of N meningitidis serogroups. In multiple European countries MenC vaccination is 
recommended for toddlers, even though the favoured timing of vaccination differs among countries.  
MenQuadfi is intended to induce antibody production specific for serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135.  
Currently two quadrivalent MenACWY vaccinations are licensed in the EU: Nimenrix (since 2012) indicated for 
the immunization from the age of 6 weeks, and Menveo (since 2010) indicated for the immunization of 
children from 2 years of age, adolescents and adults. 
Menveo is also available in the US but not Nimenrix. In addition, other MenACWY vaccinations are available in 
the US: Menactra is approved from infants as young as 9 months of age to adults 55 years of age, and 
Menomune-A/C/Y/W-135, a polysaccharide vaccine, which was licensed for persons 2 years of age and older 
at the time of the clinical trials. The production was discontinued in 2017 by the applicant (MAH of 
Menomune). According to the applicant, the decision was strategic and not based on any quality, safety, or 
efficacy issues. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
For this MAA eleven clinical studies have been submitted of which seven were considered pivotal (MET35, 
MET43, MET49, MET50, MET51, MET56 and MET57). The remaining five studies are considered supportive 
evidence (MET28, MET32, MET44, MET54, MET39). 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 104/121 
 
  
  
  
Six of the seven pivotal studies intended to demonstrate non-inferiority of seroresponse rates or 
seroprotection rates (MET51) following administration of MenQuadfi compared to different comparator 
vaccines (Nimenrix, Menveo, Menactra, and Menomune) in different age groups: 
• 
Toddlers (12-23 months): MET51, compared to Nimenrix 
•  Children (2-9 years): MET35, compared to Menveo 
•  Adolescents (10-17 years): MET50, compared to Menveo 
•  Adolescents and adults (10-17 and 18-55 years): MET43, compared to Menactra 
•  Adolescents and adults (≥15 years): MET56, compared to Menactra 
•  Older adults (>56 years): MET49, compared to Menomune 
Furthermore, lot consistency (MET43), booster dose (MET56) and administration of concomitant vaccinations 
(toddlers: MET57, adolescents: MET50) were investigated.  
Subjects were meningococcal-vaccination naïve in studies MET35, MET50, MET43 and MET49. In MET51 both 
naive and MenC primed toddlers were included. In study MET56 subjects who previously received a 
quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine were included. 
Overall, the design of the presented studies was similar. In all studies, the subjects received one dose of 
MenQuadfi or a comparator vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated immediately before vaccination and 30 
days after vaccination.  
Primary analyses were conducted in the per-protocol analysis sets (PPAS) but the respective analyses have 
also been performed in the full analysis set (FAS) with comparable results.  
In line with the relevant EMA (EMA guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 
Rev. 1) and WHO guidelines (WHO Guidelines on clinical evaluation of vaccines: regulatory expectations), it 
was agreed in a preceding scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/467602/2015) that no efficacy studies are 
necessary and that the clinical development programme of MenQuadfi is based on immunogenicity studies. 
This is based on the fact that a widely accepted immunological correlate of protection for meningococcal 
vaccines containing serogroups A, C, W and Y exists, which has also been applied in previous licensing 
procedures of conjugated meningococcal vaccines (e.g. Menveo, Nimenrix). The best established and 
scientifically proven correlate of protection against meningococcal disease to date appears to be hSBA titers 
≥1:4. rSBA titers ≥1:8 are generally also considered to correlate with protection for MenACWY vaccines, 
although formally only correlated with effectiveness for serogroup C. Each assay has its merits and overall 
the serological assays together are considered appropriate to generate sufficient data to support the likely 
protective efficacy of the vaccine. The use of hSBA titres for primary immunogenicity analyses was 
adequately justified by the applicant and accepted in a previous SA. As supportive evidence, the applicant 
also provided data derived from rSBA for all patients in studies MET 50, 56 and 35 and for a subset of 
subjects in studies MET 43, 49, 51 and 57. 
The main endpoints for the evaluation of immunogenicity were: seroprotection rates, seroresponse rates and 
geometric mean titers (GMTs). Seroprotection is defined as the percentage of subjects with an hSBA titer 
≥1:8 while seroresponse extends this definition by taking into account prevaccination titers: For subjects 
with a pre-vaccination titer ≥1:8, an at least 4-fold increase of titer needs to be demonstrated. In addition, 
GMTs were presented for all serogroups, allowing the assessment of differences in immune response between 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 105/121 
 
  
  
  
vaccines. Furthermore, percentages of subjects achieving an at least 4-fold increase of titres and reverse 
cumulative distribution curves of antibody titers (RCDs) were presented. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The MenACYW conjugate vaccine is prepared by using tetanus toxoid as the carrier protein. Conjugation of 
polysaccharide antigens to a protein carrier can induce T-cell-dependent immune responses, which are 
anticipated to give rise to higher antibody titers, longer duration of the immune response, and enhanced 
immunologic memory that allows for a booster response. 
All the core components of the MenACYW conjugate vaccine have been used extensively in licensed vaccines 
and have been shown to be safe. The meningococcal polysaccharides are the same as those used in Menactra 
(Meningococcal [Serogroups A, C, Y, and W] Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine), Menveo 
(Meningococcal [Groups A, C, Y, and W] Oligosaccharide Diphtheria CRM197 Conjugate Vaccine), and 
Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 (Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine, Groups A, C, Y, and W) vaccines. The 
source of tetanus toxoid protein used as a protein carrier in MenACYW conjugate vaccine is the same as that 
used in ActHIB (a vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib]), as a carrier in the Hib portion of all 
Sanofi Pasteur paediatric combination vaccines containing Hib such as Pentaxim (diphtheria, tetanus, 
pertussis [acellular, component], poliomyelitis [inactivated] vaccine [adsorbed], and Hib conjugate vaccine 
[DTaP2-IPV/Hib]), Pentacel (DTaP5-IPV/Hib), Hexaxim / Hexacima / Hexyon (DTaP, hepatitis B [HB], IPV, 
and Hib conjugate vaccine [DTaP2-IPV-HB-Hib]), and as the tetanus component of the 2-component 
pertussis-containing combination vaccines such as Tetraxim, Pentaxim, Hexaxim / Hexacima / Hexyon. The 
safety of the combination of these components as they appear in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine has been 
evaluated in clinical trials conducted as part of the development program in the populations of the claimed 
indication (individuals 12 months of age and older: toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults including older 
adults and the elderly). 
In all seven pivotal studies antibody response to MenQuadfi was compared to different comparators 
(Nimenrix, Menveo, Menactra, Menomune) in different age groups from toddlers of 12 - 23 months to adults 
≥56 years. In all these studies the primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of MenQuadfi against the 
comparator vaccine was met for all serogroups. In all but one study non-inferiority was based on 
seroresponse rates. Only in study MET51 non-inferiority of seroprotection rate was tested. A requested 
analysis of non-inferiority of seroresponse was also successful for this study. The respective results for 
seroresponse and seroprotection are listed in the table below. 
Seroresponse and seroprotection rates were higher in younger subjects (toddlers, children and adolescents) 
and declined with age. Across studies and age groups, MenQuadfi seroresponse rates for serogroup A were 
lower compared to C, W and Y. 
In meningococcal-vaccination-naïve subjects seroresponse rates were higher for MenQuadfi for all serogroups 
in all age groups compared to the comparators with only some exceptions such as for serogroup A in toddlers 
where the seroresponse rate is lower compared to that of Nimenrix, while still meeting non-inferiority criteria 
for seroprotection. For children the seroresponse rates for serogroup A are only numerically higher than for 
Menveo.  
In adolescents and adults, non-inferiority of seroresponse rates was demonstrated for MenQuadfi when 
administered as booster vaccination to subjects who previously received a quadrivalent meningococcal 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 106/121 
 
  
  
  
conjugate vaccine 4 to 10 years before, compared to Menactra with even (numerically) higher seroresponse 
rates and GMTs for all serotypes in favour of MenQuadfi.  
Concomitant vaccinations: In toddlers, immune response to MenQuadfi and MMR and Varicella or hexavalent 
vaccine (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) was comparable for each vaccine when given alone or concomitantly. In 
adolescents, concomitant vaccination with TdaP and HPV revealed comparable results for Tetanus and 
Diphtheria antigens and HPV.  
Lot-to-lot consistency was demonstrated in study MET43 for all three lots based on hSBA GMTs.

1) seroresponse was initially only included as observational objective; NI analysis was provided as 
requested 
2) NI was tested for toddlers who either were meningococcal vaccine naïve or had received monovalent 
MenC vaccination during infancy (MenC-primed) 
Although the cut-off for definition of hSBA seroprotection was ≥1:8, the applicant changed the cut-off for the 
definition of seroresponse in most of the pivotal studies from ≥1:8 to ≥1:16 (reaching an hSBA titer of ≥1:16 
if <1:8 pre-vaccination or achieving a 4-fold increase in hSBA titer if ≥1:8 pre-vaccination) during the 
development programme. Higher titers as proposed by the applicant provide a more conservative approach 
and were thus considered acceptable.  
According to the applicant’s submitted data the methods were found to fulfil the set criteria for the different 
properties and are therefore regarded suitable for measuring clinical samples for documentation of 
immunogenicity. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Different cut offs for hSBA titers were used for the definition of hSBA seroprotection and hSBA seroresponse 
during the development (≥1:8 vs ≥1:16). Although the use of higher titers can be considered as more 
conservative approach, a clinical justification for the chosen NI margins was missing as well as a justification 
whether the chosen NI margins are equally applicable for the different definitions of seroresponse used 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 108/121 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
during the development. However, the chosen NI-margins were also applied in the development programme 
of other MenACWY vaccines licensed in the EU. 
The chosen comparators Menactra and Menomune used in adolescents, adults and elderly, are both not 
licensed in the EU. In a preceding SA, it was stated that Menactra is not a particularly good conjugate 
vaccine. Menomune is an unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine with generally known drawbacks regarding 
immunogenicity.  
Overall, data generated in the EU is limited. Only one of the seven pivotal studies (MET51) and one 
supportive study (MET54) were conducted in the EU. Both studies included healthy toddlers aged 12 to 23 
months. No EU data is available for older subjects.  
No immunogenicity data beyond 30 days after vaccination are available to determine immune persistence. 
From other licensed quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines, rapid waning of antibodies against serogroup A is 
known. Due to absence of any long-term data, it remains unknown if this would also apply to MenQuadfi. 
In toddlers (MET51), differences were observed depending on the previously received MenC vaccination 
conjugate protein (TT or CRM). In the MenQuadfi group, seroresponse rates for serogroups A and W were 
lower for MenC-CRM primed subjects than for MenC-TT primed subjects with non-overlapping CIs (A: 50.0% 
(35.2; 64.8) vs 84.6% (77.7; 90.0); W: 44.7% (30.2; 59.9) vs 85.2 (78.5; 90.5)). Of note, the study was 
not designed to formally evaluate such differences and the number of subjects in the respective subgroups is 
low. In the control group (Nimenrix) only numerically lower seroresponse rates were observed.  
Booster vaccination 
Primed subjects have only been included in two studies: Study MET56 included adolescent and adult subjects 
(15-55 years) previously vaccinated with a meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccine and study MET51 
included toddlers who received a monovalent meningococcal C conjugate (MenC) vaccination during infancy. 
No data for MenQuadfi are available from primed adolescents or adults previously vaccinated with MenC. The 
majority of subjects in study MET56 previously received a vaccine not licensed in the EU (Menactra) (327/384 
in the MenQuadfi group and 340/389 in the Menactra group). Additionally, data from study MET56 do not 
allow meaningful comparison of boosting between subjects that have been primed with different conjugates 
as also recommended by the WHO due to the limited number of subjects previously vaccinated with Menveo 
(48/384 in the MenQuadfi group and 39/389 in the Menactra group).  
No data are available for MenQuadfi to boost itself.  
Concomitant vaccinations 
In study MET57, lower seroresponse rates and significantly lower GMTs for serogroup A, when MenQuadfi is 
concomitantly administered with PCV13 compared to MenQuadfi alone, were observed (seroresponse rate S+ 
(=seropositive at baseline) and S- (=seronegative at baseline): 56.1% (48.9; 63.2) vs. 71.9% (61.8; 80.6); 
seroresponse rate S+: 37.5% (27.8; 48.0) vs. 57.7% (43.2; 71.3); GMT: 24.6 (20.2; 30.1) vs. 49.0 (36.8; 
65.3).  
In study MET50 the concomitant vaccination of MenQuadfi and TdaP reduced the immune response to 3 of 4 
pertussis antigens as shown by non-inferiority analysis of GMCs. The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
ratio of GMCs in Group 3 (MenQuadfi+TdaP+HPV) and Group 4 (TdaP+HPV) was >2/3 in only one (PT) of the 
4 pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, FIM).   
•  Quality aspects: 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 109/121 
 
  
  
  
Serogroup A differs from the other three serogroups C, Y and W135 in several basic aspects (e.g. binding to 
conjugate, process residuals). Additionally, dissociation rates of the conjugate differ between serogroup A 
and the other three serogroups. Free polysaccharide of serogroup A is elevated, compared to the other 
serogroups, in the accelerated stability study of the Drug Substance. In the real time stability study for the 
Drug Product, a higher increase of free polysaccharides can be observed for serogroup A in the course of 
time. 
The applicant introduced a release specification of not more than 20% free saccharides and an end-of-shelf-
life specification that allows 30% free saccharides. These specifications were not justified. At day 150, two 
studies were presented, reflecting immunogenicity data derived from a new batch (MET49) and an older 
batch (MET44). However, these data are not considered useful to further justify the specification limits. The 
definition of seroresponse differs between the two studies and makes any comparisons unfeasible. 
Furthermore, the actual amount of free polysaccharide is only known for serogroup Y in one of the studies 
and not known at all for the other study. For serogroup A, the applicant additionally justifies the proposed 
limit based on phase III lot results and stability trend analysis. This can in principle be accepted, however, 
the respective results do not support the proposed acceptance criteria for the other strains. The mouse 
immunogenicity data seem to confirm the applicants proposed specification limit. However, the unit of the 
ELISA data provided is not clear, considering also the fact that for serogroups Y and W135, the result doubled 
after 6 months under accelerated conditions. 
It was acknowledged that the applicant has experience with other quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines, but 
the data presented didn’t fully justify the proposed specification limits of NMT 20% free PS for release and 
NMT 30% free PS for end of shelf life for MenQuadfi. 
Clarification on the mouse immunogenicity data was provided upon request. An arbitrary value in MEU was 
assigned to the reference standard serum based on the dilution and absorbance in ELISA. The release 
specification for free polysaccharide is reduced to NMT 13 % and the stability specifications of NMT 30 % will 
be reassessed for all serogroups, which was considered acceptable. 
The end of shelf life was claimed at 48 months. However, no stability data is available for 48 months yet. The 
currently available stability data for the drug product show clear signs of degradation of the Meningococcal 
Polysaccharide Serogroup A Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate after 36 months (3 batches; 15%, 15% and 17%) 
while after 24 months, the measured free polysaccharide content was below the LOQ. In order to justify the 
shelf life claim of 48 months, the applicant was asked to provide an update to ongoing stability studies, which 
was provided up to 42 months. Data of three lots of drug product was presented until the time point of 42 
months. All parameters were inside the acceptance criteria. Since no data is available for the 48-month time 
point, the proposed shelf life of 48 months was not endorsed. The applicant revised the shelf life of the drug 
product form 48 months to 42 months as requested.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The overall safety database of MenACYW consists of 7116 subjects. 6398 subjects received the final 
MenACYW formulation, thereof 5417 alone and 981 subjects with a concomitant vaccine. Out of the 5417 
subjects exposed to MenACYW, there were 691 toddlers, 492 children (2 through 9 years), 1897 adolescents, 
1684 adults, 298 older adults (56 to 64 years), and 349 elderly adults (65 years and above). Toddlers and 
subjects above 2 years of age are separately described in the SmPC based on different rates of solicited 
reactions, different number of MenC priming doses and time point of priming up to one month before study 
vaccination. Children, adolescents, adults (aged 18-55 years and above 56 years of age) were separately 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 110/121 
 
  
  
  
evaluated, but may be described integratively in the SmPC due to the comparability in design and conduct of 
the studies and the similar nature of reported adverse events. 
In toddlers (12 through 23 months of age), 56.4% of subjects who received MenACYW and 57.6% of subjects 
who received Nimenrix reported any solicited injection site reaction. The most commonly reported solicited 
injection site reactions were erythema and tenderness in both groups. Among the subjects above 2 years of 
age, 41.3% of subjects reported solicited injection site reactions in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group, 
with pain (38.3%) as the most commonly reported.   
In the age group pool for toddlers, the percentage of subjects who experienced at least one solicited systemic 
reaction was comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (64.5%) and the Nimenrix group 
(62.9%). The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were irritability followed by abnormal 
crying. In subjects above 2 years of age, the percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited 
systemic reaction within 7 days of vaccine injection was 45.2% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group. 
The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were myalgia (30.7%), headache (26.4%) followed 
by malaise (21.7%).  
The rates of each of the injection site and systemic ARs were in general similar between MenACYW and the 
respective comparator vaccine, and the majority of solicited reactions were Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity. The 
percentage of subjects experiencing Grade 3 solicited injection site or systemic reactions was low in the 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (up to 4.5% and 2%  experienced Grade 3 injection site reactions and up 
to 4.3% and 4.1% experienced Grade 3 systemic reactions in toddlers and in subjects above 2 years of age, 
respectively). 
The percentage of unsolicited AEs reported by toddlers was 54.7% and in subjects above 2 years of age 
20.7% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group. The majority of unsolicited AEs were in the SOCs of 
‘Infections and infestations’ followed by ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’, ‘Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders’, and ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’. In these SOCs, the most frequently 
reported PTs were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, injection site 
pruritus, rhinitis and fever, corresponding mainly to common respiratory or gastrointestinal ailments and 
infections.   
The percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited AR within 30 days of vaccine injection was low in 
toddlers (5%) and in subjects above 2 years of age (2.8%) in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group. The 
most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs were in the SOC ‘General disorders and administration 
site conditions’ (1.6%). The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs in this SOC were injection 
site pruritus (0.7%) and injection site warmth (0.4%) followed by fatigue, injection site bruising and injection 
site rash (0.1% each) reported in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group. Other unsolicited ARs reported by 
at least 0.1% of subjects were diarrhea and dizziness (0.2% each), and nausea (0.1%) in the MenACYW 
conjugate vaccine group. No unexpected ARs were identified.    
In toddlers, the frequency of SAEs was 0.8% in the MenACYW and 0.3% in the Nimenrix vaccine group. 
Among subjects above 2 years of age, the percentage of SAEs were 0.4% in the MenACYW group.  There 
were no noteworthy differences in the incidence of any preferred terms between the vaccine groups. 
There were no deaths reported in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
As regards the different types of vaccines used in children, adolescents and adults, it should be noted that 
only Menveo is an EU-licensed vaccine (Menactra and Menomune are US-licensed). Overall, 995 subjects 
received Menveo, among which 494 were children 2-9 years of age and 501 were adolescents 10-17 years of 
age, but none were adults. 
Further of note, all adults above 56 years of age received either MenACYW (n=647) or the comparator 
Menomune (n=553), an unconjugated MCV4 vaccine that is no longer available (formerly US-licensed). A 
higher reactogenicity profile (in terms of solicited and unsolicited adverse reactions) was observed after 
MenACYW compared to Menomune vaccination, which could possibly be attributed to the different 
pharmaceutical form. Hence, the established safety profile in older adults (above 56 years of age) is more 
reasonably indirectly compared to the safety profile observed in MenACYW vaccinated younger adults. 
Reassuringly, however, older adults showed a lower reactogenicity profile compared to younger adults 
(except for the unsolicited adverse reactions (mostly injection site ARs). The age cut-off used for older adults 
(56 years) was justified as due to the fact that at the time of study conduct, Menomune was the only licensed 
vaccine in the older age group 56 years and older in the US. Observed differences between older/elderly 
subjects and younger adults are reflected in the SmPC. 
The adverse events table as presented in the SmPC seems incomplete and differs from the Menveo AE 
profile. It cannot be followed which adverse reactions (that were per definition related to vaccination) were 
considered irrelevant enough not to be mentioned in the SmPC (SmPC comment). 
SAEs and any pre-specified AESIs should be collected from all trial subjects for at least 6 months after the 
last dose of assigned treatment, however, in toddlers and elderly there are no 6 months safety data available 
as the trial duration was substantially shorter.   
In study MET57, the frequency of reported AEs (solicited and unsolicited events) was in general lower, 
especially in Russian study sites where PCV13 was used as concomitant vaccine, than in studies MET51 and 
MET54 conducted in the EU, in the same age group. As there were fewer reports from the Russian study sites 
it is difficult to compare the results of the concomitant vaccines.  
Although concomitant vaccination was tolerated without unexpected or serious safety concerns, more 
adverse reactions are to be expected with concomitant vaccination. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Experience with the product from pregnant women is limited, and women in their childbearing years will 
potentially receive the vaccine. Therefore ‘Use during pregnancy’ is included as missing information in the 
RMP and a pregnancy registry was established. 
No data is available concerning concomitant administration of MenQuadfi with MenB vaccines in adolescents. 
However, this is listed as missing information in the RMP, and the applicant will initiate a study to explore this 
issue.  
There are currently only limited data on the safety of booster doses (810 adolescents and adults ≥ 15 years 
of age).  
During the assessment of the non-clinical development the following concern arose: The fact that dark faeces 
were found in all cages of treated animals strongly suggests that this observation is treatment-related. It is 
unclear whether these findings may have been caused by a transient toxicological adverse effect (that was 
consequently not observed during later histological investigations). Considering that the relevance of the rat 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 112/121 
 
  
  
  
repeated dose study for humans was doubted, it is unclear whether this finding also bears relevance for the 
clinical use of MenQuadfi.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In all main clinical studies, the primary endpoints were met and non-inferior seroresponse rates or 
seroprotection rates, respectively, of MenQuadfi 30 days after vaccination against different comparators was 
demonstrated for all serogroups in all age groups except for serogroup A in the subgroup of MenC-primed 
toddlers. The applicant justifies the applied non-inferiority margins mainly based on precedence from other 
development programs, as well as feasibility concerns. A justification based on clinical considerations (e.g. 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 116/121 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relevance of a 10% lower seroresponse rate in terms of vaccine efficacy) or statistical considerations (e.g. 
assay sensitivity) is missing. Given the reference to other development programmes as well as the clear 
demonstration of NI against various comparator vaccines across studies this issue is not further pursued.   
Although seroprotection is considered clinically relevant for the individual subject, seroresponse is considered 
more relevant for the immunogenicity assessment, especially since a rather high percentage of subjects with 
seroprotective titres at baseline was included in the submitted studies. In all but one study non-inferiority 
analyses were based on seroresponse rates. However, demonstration of non-inferiority in children was based 
on seroprotection rates. An additional analysis based on seroresponse rates was provided upon request and 
showed non-inferiority for all serogroups. 
The lower seroresponse rates against serogroup A as observed with concomitant vaccination with PCV13 and 
the lower seroresponse rates against serogroup A in toddlers primed with a CRM-conjugate vaccine compared 
to a TT-conjugate vaccine are considered relevant to be described in the SmPC. Although the latter finding is 
based on data from subgroup analysis in a rather low number of subjects and should therefore be interpreted 
cautiously, this effect was not observed for the comparator vaccine. Especially for vaccinees at high risk for 
MenA infection, this information is considered relevant. Overall, an impact of the vaccine conjugate used for 
priming cannot be ruled out based on the presented data.   
The investigation of long-term persistence data in the postmarketing is considered acceptable. Nevertheless, 
the absence of such data so far needs to be adequately stated in the SmPC.  
From both other licensed quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines rapid waning of antibodies against serogroup 
A is known and is described in their SmPCs. Due to the absence of any data beyond D30 following vaccination 
with MenQuadfi, it remains unknown if this is also applicable for MenQuadfi or not. A general statement on 
this effect known from other licensed vaccines should therefore be added in the SmPC.  
Declining seroresponse and seroprotection rates with age are not unexpected and were also observed in the 
comparator groups. 
Several concerns have initially been raised whether the presented data are representative for the European 
population. Only two studies have been conducted in the EU and it is known also from other (EU-licensed) 
meningococcal vaccines, that a variety of factors can have significant influence on the circulating serotypes 
and the potential degree of carriage. A comparison of data from toddlers from studies MET51 (EU) and MET57 
(Russia, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand) showed comparable seroresponse rates despite different 
seroprotection rates at baseline. Data for older subjects is still not available but the presented results for 
toddlers are reassuring.  
The identified uncertainties concerning concomitant vaccinations have an impact on the SmPC wordings. This 
concerns on the one hand the observed differences (Pertussis antigens, PCV13). Even though the clinical 
consequences of a decreased immune response to 3 of 4 pertussis antigens is not entirely clear and similar 
observations were reported for other meningococcal vaccines, this result is relevant for practical use and thus 
should be provided in the product information. Concomitant use of MenQuadfi and PCV13 can be 
recommended but a respective warning for subjects at risk of MenA infections has to be included in the 
SmPC. On the other hand, this concerns extrapolation of available data into general recommendations in 
section 4.5 of the SmPC. It is not considered straightforward to extrapolate data from one particular vaccine 
to all vaccines containing the same antigens. Notably, variable enhancement or depression of immune 
responses to conjugated saccharides has been observed when the carrier proteins for co-administered 
products are the same or different, so that generalizations cannot be made beyond the specific vaccines 
studied and respective detailed information about the used vaccines have to be added to the SmPC. However, 
EMA/CHMP/452679/2020 
Page 117/121 
 
  
  
  
the concerns on concomitant vaccination are not considered to affect the benefit risk balance. Upon request, 
these findings were adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
For a comprehensive assessment of immunogenicity of MenQuadfi data on long-term persistence and on the 
ability of MenQuadfi to boost itself are necessary. The applicant plans to address this with three 
postmarketing studies, which are included in Annex II as category I post marketing studies.  
The applicant introduced a release specification of not more than 20% free saccharides and an end-of-shelf-
life specification that allows 30% free saccharides. Whereas the theoretical concern that an increased rate of 
free saccharides might cause hyporesponsiveness to further doses of conjugate vaccine will be investigated in 
the postmarketing by booster studies, there is still insufficient justification for the proposed end-of-shelf-life 
specifications. The release limits for free PS have been lowered to NMT 13%. The applicant commits to 
reassess stability specifications of NMT 30 % for all serogroups, which is acceptable.  
The ability of MenQuadfi to boost other quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines was investigated. However, as 
the majority of adolescent subjects previously received Menactra it is unclear in how far data mainly derived 
from subjects who previously received a vaccine not licensed in the EU can be extrapolated to the European 
population. Three postmarketing studies are planned for further evaluation of immunogenicity of MenQuadfi 
in primed subjects (included in Annex II). Furthermore, no data from adults and adolescents who were 
primed with a MenC vaccine are available. However, respective data from toddlers are reassuring to some 
degree that MenQuadfi is able to elicit a sufficient immune response in subjects primed with EU-licensed 
vaccines as well as in MenC primed subjects. As there is no clinically plausible reason to assume that there 
might be a difference between toddlers and older age groups, the postponing of further investigation in 
adolescents and adults to the postmarketing is acceptable.  
The concerns raised concerning the stability of the conjugate could impact the intended shelf life claim of 48 
months. So far (day 150), stability data have been provided until the time point of 42 months. All parameters 
tested meet the specifications. As no data is available for 48 months, the proposed shelf life claim of 48 
months could not currently be endorsed and was revised to 42 months.  
Overall, the nature and frequency of the reported adverse events are considered to be consistent with those 
expected after meningococcal vaccine administration. There were no serious or unexpected safety findings 
with a suspected causal relationship to the vaccine. 
No concern is raised on the use of non EU-licensed comparator vaccines from a safety perspective for the 
following reasons: Comparative data to an EU-licensed vaccine are available in a proportion of subjects and 
both conjugated vaccines Menveo and Menactra are expected to show largely comparable safety profiles, 
despite containing a different amount of antigen and different carrier proteins. Indeed, only small differences 
in the safety profiles were observed between the different treatment arms that are considered not to 
influence the benefit risk conclusion. Further, adolescents and adults are expected to show comparable safety 
profiles based on mechanistic considerations, which was also confirmed by the results. In addition, the safety 
assessments are considered appropriate and sufficiently similar across studies to allow pooling of the results 
by age group and by vaccine type. Therefore, a within treatment-group comparison by age group for the 
pooled MenACYW analysis as well as the between-treatment group comparison of MenACYW to Menveo and 
Menactra within the ISS is overall sufficient. Reassuringly, older adults, in whom more adverse reactions 
were reported compared to Menomune, showed a lower reactogenicity profile when compared to younger 
adults. This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
From an immunogenicity point of view, the results are overall favourable. In all clinical studies the primary 
endpoints were met. There was even a trend towards higher seroresponse rates for MenQuadfi compared to 
other quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. Also, secondary endpoints do in general support the results from 
the primary endpoints. Nevertheless, some uncertainties remain but could be adequately reflected in the 
SmPC or addressed in the postmarketing. 
The safety profile of MenQuadfi is considered acceptable. 
The applicant initially claimed the following indication for MenQuadfi: “MenQuadfi is indicated for active 
primary and booster immunisation for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. MenQuadfi is indicated for use in individuals 12 months of age and 
older. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with available official recommendations.” 
Including the wording, “primary and booster” immunisation, was not considered appropriate. Two comparable 
quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines are already approved in the EU (Menveo since 2010 and Nimenrix since 
2012). The indication of MenQuadfi should be consistent with these other vaccines. Therefore, rewording of 
the indication was needed.  
The applicant revised the wording of indication as follows: “MenQuadfi is indicated for active immunisation of 
individuals from the age of 12 months and older, against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y.” This wording is considered acceptable. 
Taken together, MenQuadfi could be approvable in the revised indication.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of MenQuadfi is favourable in the following indication: 
“MenQuadfi is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older, against 
invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y.  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with available official recommendations”.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets are presented as a red and brown red, respectively, 
round, biconvex tablets that contain rivaroxaban as the active substance. Other ingredients in the 
tablet core include microcrystalline cellulose , croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose, lactose 
monohydrate magnesium stearate  and sodium laurilsulfate. The tablet coating consists of ferric oxide 
red, hypromellose,  polyethylene glycol and titanium dioxide. The tablets are  packaged in 
thermoformed PP or PVC/PVDC blisters. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Manufacture – Specification- Stability 
The chemical name for rivaroxaban is 5-Chloro-N-({(5S)-2-oxo-3-[4-(3-oxo-4-morpholinyl)phenyl]-
1,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}methyl)-2-thiophenecarboxamide. The active substance is of the same quality with 
the one used in the currently approved Xarelto 10 mg tablets. The synthetic process, controls and 
specifications are same as the currently approved ones.

Rivaroxaban is a class II substance in the BCS classification system. It has a low aqueous solubility, 
which is overcome by reducing the particle size with micronisation. Appropriate limits have been 
included in the active substance specifications to monitor the particle size and size distribution.

2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The additional two strengths of 15mg and 20mg have been developed using the development and 
manufacturing experience gained with the currently approved 10 mg strength.  The same excipients 
have been chosen for the formulation of the tablet cores. They are of pharmacopoeial quality and are 
commonly used in these kinds of formulations. All dose strengths have been formulated to the same 
tablet size and weight. The increased amount of the active substance is compensated by a 
corresponding smaller amount of lactose monohydrate and cellulose microcrystalline to keep the tablet 
weight constant.

Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is a standard process that consists of the following main steps: fluidised-
bed granulation, mixing, tabletting and film-coating. All critical process parameters have been 
identified and are controlled by appropriate in process controls.  
Although the proposed manufacturing process has not been validated at commercial scale, the batch 
analysis data collected from 23 clinical batches and three production scale batches for the 20 mg 
strength and from 10 clinical batches and 1 commercial batch for the 15 mg strength, are sufficient to 
indicate that the manufacturing process is robust and can reproducibly produce finished product of 
consistent quality complying with the approved specifications. 
In addition the applicant will perform process validation studies on the first three consecutive 
commercial scale batches in accordance with the approved validation protocol. 
Product specification 
The specification for the finished product at release and shelf life includes tests for appearance, 
identification (TLC, NIR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur. Paddle apparatus), uniformity 
of dosage units (Ph.Eur), impurities and microbial purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification and control tests applied for the finished product at time of release and throughout 
the life of the product, are in compliance with general pharmacopoeial standards (including 
Ph Eur) and ICH guidelines (Q3B and Q6A). The specifications for release and throughout shelf life are 
identical except uniformity of content and identification. These parameters will only be tested at 
release. 
Batch analysis data from clinical and commercial scale batches have been presented. All batches met 
the test limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of batch 
release.

Stability of the product 
Three pilot scale batches of each strength (20 mg and 15 mg) have been stored for long-term stability 
studies at 25 °C/60 % RH and 30 °C/75 % RH and for accelerated stability studies at 40 °C / 75 % RH 
in accordance with ICH requirements. The samples were packaged in the same commercial packaging 
materials as those intended for commercial manufacturing (PP blister and PVC/PVDC blister). 
Thirty six months of stability data have been presented for all three batches of each strength stored at 
25 °C / 60 % RH and 30 °C /75 % RH. Additionally, accelerated stability data covering a period of 6 
months stored at 40 °C /75 % RH  have been provided 
The parameters studied are appearance, degradation products (any unspecified and total), assay, 
dissolution and microbial purity using the same  analytical methods used for release, which have been 
shown to be stability indicating.  Additionally hardness, disintegration and water content were tested 
on an informative basis using the Ph. Eur test methods. 
Results from thermal and high humidity stress testing have shown that the tablets are very table, 
while results from a photostability study demonstrate that the tablets are not sensitive to light. 
In  all  cases  the  stability  results  presented  were  satisfactory,  within  the  predefined  specifications  and 
support the proposed shelf life for the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in 
the SPC.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical 
documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major deviations from EU 
and ICH requirements. The development of the 15mg and 20 mg strengths is based largely on the 
currently approved Xarelto 10 mg tablets.  
The active substance is well characterised and documented. It is a class II substance in the BCS 
classification system. Like in the case of Xarelto 10 mg tablets, its low aqueous solubility is overcome 
by reducing the particle size with micronisation. Appropriate limits have been included in the active 
substance specifications to monitor the particle size and size distribution. Moreover the release of the 
active from the finished product is controlled routinely with a discriminatory dissolution test. The 
excipients are commonly used in these types of formulations and comply with Ph. Eur. requirements. 
The packaging materials are commonly used and well documented. The manufacturing process of the 
finished product is a standard granulation, tabletting and coating process that has been adequately 
described. Stability tests indicate that the product under ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable 
for the proposed shelf life. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no 
unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Overall,  the  pharmacological  programme  is  comprehensive,  providing  a  good  characterisation  of  the 
pharmacological  properties  of  rivaroxaban.  Four  new  studies  (mitochondrial  protein  measurement, 
phototoxicity,  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies,  carcinogenicity  studies)  have  been  submitted  in  this 
application and give additional information. 
2.3.2.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The results from previous studies show that rivaroxaban inhibits FXa, leading to secondary changes in 
coagulation parameters like aPTT and PT. Efficacy was demonstrated in various thrombotic models and 
in  general  there  appears  to  be  a  dose  margin  between  the  antithrombotic  effect  and  the  risk  for 
increased bleeding.  
The results of receptor binding and enzyme inhibition demonstrated that rivaroxaban is a selective FXa 
inhibitor,  and  that  pharmacological  effects  due  to  interaction  with  unrelated  receptors/enzymes  are 
unlikely.  Rivaroxaban  did  not  cause  platelet  activation  or  aggregation  in  the  presence  of  HIT 
antibodies.  Considering  the  similarity  of  the  structure  of  the  molecule  with  linezolid  which  was 
discussed  in  the  previous  procedure,  a  noteworthy  finding  is  that  rivaroxaban  did  not  inhibit 
monoamine oxidase. 
2.3.3.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Rivaroxaban has a structural similarity to the antibiotic linezolid, sharing the central 5-S oxazolidinone 
structure that has been found to be essential for antibacterial activity of the latter molecule. However, 
data  about  the  antibacterial  activity  of  rivaroxaban  and  selected  metabolites  for  three  Gram  positive 
strains  of  bacteria  suggest  that  neither  rivaroxaban,  nor  metabolites  M1,  M2  or  M15  have  any 
antibacterial activity at relevant concentrations.  
Another, related issue is the possibility of mitochondrial toxicity. Linezolid inhibits bacterial growth by 
binding  to  the  heavy  ribosomal  subunit,  thereby  inhibiting  bacterial  protein  synthesis.  Mitochondrial 
ribosomes  are  similar  to  bacterial  ribosomes  and  linezolid  is  known  to  inhibit  mitochondrial  protein 
synthesis  too.  This  leads  to  an  eventual  depletion  of  mitochondrial-derived  proteins,  e.g.  key 
components  in  the  electron  transport  chain,  and  a  loss  of  mitochondrial  function.  The  absence  of  an 
antibacterial effect of rivaroxaban (and metabolites) does not necessarily imply an absence of an effect 
on mitochondria, as other factors, e.g. permeability, are important for the end result.  
This issue has been addressed in two new studies;  
-  Mitochondrial  protein  synthesis  was  measured  in  isolated  rat  liver  mitochondria  using  linezolid  as 
positive control. Up to the limit of thermodynamic solubility in aqueous solution (5 μg/mL), rivaroxaban 
did not cause inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis.  
-  A  study  on  measurement  of  mitochondrial  protein  synthesis  after  4-week oral  (gavage) 
administration  in  rats  revealed  that  rivaroxaban  did  not  affect  protein  synthesis  and  activity  of 
mitochondrially encoded  respiratory  chain  complex  proteins  and  thus,  rivaroxaban  did  not  show  any 
linezolidlike mitochondrial toxicity.

2.3.4.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology studies do not suggest that any acute adverse exaggerated pharmacological 
effects  of  rivaroxaban,  except  bleeding,  are  likely.  Pharmacokinetic  data,  showing  that  the  animals 
were  adequately  exposed,  were  collected  in  several  studies.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the 
safety pharmacology results were obtained after a single dose of rivaroxaban. Consequently, the safety 
pharmacology  programme  was  not  designed  to  detect  any  long-term  pharmacological  effects  like 
adaptation  and  rebound  phenomenons.  Some  of  the  findings  in  the  repeated  dose  toxicology  studies 
may, at least partly, depend on the primary pharmacological mechanisms of rivaroxaban. 
2.3.5.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
There are no pharmacodynamic drug interactions submitted in this application.  
2.3.6.  Pharmacokinetics 
Non-clinical  ADME  studies  were  conducted  mainly  in  rats  (Wistar)  and  dogs  (Beagle).  Toxicokinetic 
data were collected from repeated dose studies in mice (CD-1) rats, dogs and female rabbits (CHBB). 
General  organ  distribution  was  studied  in  Wistar  rats  and  pigmented  rats  (Long  Evans);  placental 
transfer and excretion into milk was studied in female Wistar rats. 
In  addition,  plasma  protein  binding  and  metabolism  data  was  generated  in  vitro  for  several  species, 
including  Cynomolgus  monkeys  and  humans.  Several  in  vitro  studies  were  made  to  characterise  the 
involvement, inhibition and induction of CYPs, P-gp and Bcrp. Finally, cell permeability was studied in 
Caco-2 cells.  
Absorption  after  a  single  oral  dose  of  rivaroxaban  was  rapid  in  both  rats  and  dogs  with  a  maximal 
plasma concentration in about 0.5 hours after oral administration in both rats and dogs. The extent of 
absorption  was  somewhat  lower  in  rats  (67%)  than  in  dogs  (92%).  After  repeat  dosing  for  4  weeks, 
there was an increased absorption in rats, but not in mice or dogs. There was also a gender difference 
in rats, with higher exposure in the females.  
Protein  binding  varied  between  species,  being  highest  in  the  rat  (98.7%)  and  lowest  in  the  rabbit 
(76.6%).  Mechanistic  studies  showed  that  serum  albumin  is  the  main  binding  protein.  However,  a 
mechanistic  study  with  human  serum  albumin  (HSA)  and  oleic  acid  showed  a  striking  difference  in 
protein  binding  depending  on  the  oleic  acid  concentration.  This  difference  in  protein  binding  is  large 
enough to cover almost the entire range observed in different species. 
Organ  distribution  after  a  single  oral  dose  of  rivaroxaban  is  unremarkable,  showing  the  highest 
concentrations in the gastro-intestinal tract, liver and kidneys, and low concentrations in the brain. The 
distribution in pigmented rats was similar but could not exclude some affinity to melanin. Rivaroxaban 
passes the placenta barrier but does not accumulate in the foetuses. The substance is excreted into rat 
milk. 
Rivaroxaban is subject to oxidative metabolism in the liver. The main metabolic pathway is catalysed 
by CYP2J2 and CYP3A4. The metabolism is qualitatively similar in man and the toxicology species and 
there  were  no  unique  human  metabolite.  The  rat  differs  from  dogs  and  humans  with  a  higher 
proportion of rivaroxaban + metabolites excreted in bile/faeces, and a lower proportion excreted in the 
urine.  
Both P-gp and BCRP are most likely involved in the renal excretion of rivaroxaban.  
In  conclusion,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  rivaroxaban  is  well  known.  Additional  studies  provided 
new  data  regarding  human  BCRP  substrate  characteristics.  The  studies  showed  that  rivaroxaban 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/301607/2011 
Page 10/49
 
 
 
 
caused  only  a  slight  inhibition  of  Bcrp  in  in  vitro  studies.  This  is  considered  not  to  be  of  clinical 
relevance.  
Ketoconazole and ritonavir caused an increase of rivaroxaban plasma exposure and a decrease of renal 
clearance of rivaroxaban in clinical drug-drug interaction studies. This finding is most likely the result 
of the combined oxidative CYP3A4/3A5-catalyzed oxidative metabolic pathway and the inhibition of the 
transporter-mediated active renal secretion of rivaroxaban. Both drugs (ketokonazole and ritonavir) 
exhibited only a moderate exposure increase of rivaroxaban in vivo. As a conclusion, the 
pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban was not altered by the additional studies. 
2.3.7.  Toxicology 
2.3.7.1.  Repeat dose toxicity 
With this application, oral repeat dose toxicity studies have been performed in the mouse (4-13w), the 
rat (4-13-26w) and in the dog (4-13-52w) to support long term use in patients.  
The clinical crystal formulation of rivaroxaban (micronized) was used in two of the repeat-dose studies 
and in the carcinogenicity studies. The oral toxicity profile in each species could be investigated up to 
relatively  high  systemic  exposures  of  unbound  fraction  of  rivaroxaban  without  that  no  apparent  MTD 
was reached in the rodent species. In the dog, MTD was reached at high dose in the 13- and 52-week 
studies ( 23x and 14x clinical exposures in terms of  AUC unbound, respectively). 
Main findings in mice, seen from the low dose level tested (margin of unbound AUC exposure of 3x and 
4x  for  M  and  F,  respectively)  were  significant  decrease  in  leucocyte  count  and  effects  on  the  liver. 
Decreased  leucocyte  count  was  evident  in  all  four  studies.  With  the  clinical  crystal  formulation  of 
rivaroxaban  (micronized),  focal  liver  necrosis  together  with  increased  liver  weight  (abs+rel)  and 
decreases 
in 
liver  proteins  were  determined 
(serum  ASAT  and  ALAT,  activities  of 
ECOD/EROD/ALD/GLU-T)  from  LD.  In  the  two  other  13  weeks  studies,  using  other  formulations, 
sporadic  focal  liver  necrosis  were  seen  also,  but  overall,  no  clear  relationship  to  exposure  was 
identified.  In  the  newly  submitted  carcinogenicity  study  in  mice  there  was  a  numerical  increased 
incidence of tumors with dose but with no increase in foci of hepatocellular alteration.. Hepatic tumors 
were also within expected control ranges (see further below). These findings suggest that rivaroxaban 
induced some effects on the liver in mice, but as further described below, there were no obvious signs 
of  hepatic  toxicity  in  either  the  rat  or  dog.  Furthermore,  the  long-term  clinical  studies  do  not  reveal 
signs of hepatotoxicity. 
In rat, no treatment-related mortality was reported in the oral studies. In the study using the clinical 
crystal formulation of rivaroxaban (PH-34379, 13-week study), different treatment-related effects were 
determined  from  the  lowest  dose  levels  tested  (no  NOAEL,  margin  of  unbound  AUC  exposure  of  2.0x 
and  4.1x    for  M  and  F,  respectively):  increase  in  urine  output,  liver  (periportal  inflammatory 
infiltrates/megacaryocytes,  transient  increase  in  ALAT  and    unspecific  biomarker  of  cell  leakage  LDH, 
decrease in glutamate dehydrogenase, GLDH, with highest activity in periacinar hepatocytes), decrease 
in heart weight (abs+rel), pancreatic acinar hypertrophy, optic nerve fiber degeneration, and poplietal 
lymph node pigmentation. From next dose level, sporadic liver lesions were noted in single animals. In 
the other oral studies using the nonclinical crystal co precipitate formulation of rivaroxaban (PEG 6000 
melt coprecipitate, treatment-related effects were increased amount of IgG and IgA (from LD at 4 and 
13w of treatment; not measured in the 26w study) and increased incidence of pancreatic lesions (from 
LD in the feeding study). At higher dosing, urine crystals formation together with increased creatinine

and urea content and increased incidence of ovary follicle cysts were noted in the 26w study from MD. 
Slight to marked increase in sperm granuloma was determined in HD animals of 4 and 26w studies. 
The studies with the PEG 6000 melt coprecipitate formulation revealed that ALAT increased transiently 
up 1-3 month of treatment without any signs of liver lesions at autopsy 2-3 months later (from LD in 
the  26w  study).  There  were  also  signs  of  decrease  in  absolute  and  relative  heart  weight. 
Myocardiopathy  was  noted  in  two  HD  female  rats  of  the  26  week  study,  but  those  occurred  at  very 
high exposure levels. Although there was a relatively small but consistent decrease in heart weight in 
most rat studies, there was overall no histological correlate in the heart. Thus, the toxicological as well 
as clinical relevance of the finding of decreased heart weight is uncertain / unknown. 
In  dog,  coagulation  time  data  (PT  and/or  PTT)  suggested  treatment  resistance  development. 
Consequently, bleeding related observations was greater at w13 than at w52. No study was conducted 
with  the  clinical  crystal  formulation  of  rivaroxaban,  instead  the  PEG  6000  melt  coprecipitate 
formulation was used. Slight dose-dependent increase in liver weight was seen in the 4 w study (with 
minimal  periportal  vacuolation  and  centrilobular  fat)  but  not  in  the  longer  studies.  Four  male  dogs  of 
the 52 w study (2LD/2MD) had minimal/slight cytoplasmic vacuoles/inclusions in the liver.  
In  the  kidney,  treatment-related  increase  in  the  incidence  of  small  dense  nuclei  of  collecting  duct 
epithelial cells was reported from LD in males of the 52w study (no NOAEL).  
No effect on ECG, BP, reflex, ophthalmology, urinalyses, hormone (T3, T4), and liver N-demethylase, 
O-demethylase,  P450  and  TG,  was  reported.  Overall,  there  was  no  indication  of  hepatic  or  cardiac 
toxicity identified in the dog. Furthermore, there was no finding of optic (nerve) toxicity in dogs. Thus, 
the slightly higher incidence of optic nerve degeneration seen in some rat studies is not considered a 
cause  of  concern,  since  the  pigmented  dog  eye  is  considered  more  relevant  for  assessing  effects  on 
eye, than the albino rat. 
2.3.7.2. 
 Genotoxicity 
Rivaroxaban was tested negative in the standard battery for genotoxicity testing as part of the initial 
Marketing Authorisation. 
2.3.7.3. 
 Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of rivaroxaban was tested in 2-year studies in mice and rats. Dose selection 
was based on a limit of absorption of microcrystalline rivarixaban at 60 mg/kg.  
Both studies were performed as gavage studies applying doses of 10, 20 and 60 mg/kg of micronized 
rivaroxaban. Study details and major observations in neoplastic lesions are summarized in table below.

The  selected  doses  were  10,  20  and  60  mg/kg.  At  these  doses  the  margins  of  exposure  when 
compared to the human plasma levels at 20 mg/day were only 0.4, 0.6, 1.0 and 0.7, 1.3, 1.6 in males 
and  females,  respectively,  and  in  the  rat  study  1.0, 1.2,  1.5  and  2.6,  3.6,  3.6  in  males  and  females, 
respectively. Administration of rivaroxaban as PEG 6000 melt coprecipitate formulation had resulted in 
higher  systemic  exposure.  However,  the  melt  coprecipitation  process  led  to  the  formation  of  a 
genotoxic  anilino-morpholinone  which  was  considered  to  imply  a  risk  of  false  positive  results  in 
carcinogenicity  testing.  The  dose  selection  was  agreed  with  the  EMA  in  a  scientific  advice.    The  dose 
selection  is  acceptable  considering  the  limit  of  absorption  of  microcrystalline  rivarixaban  and  risk  of 
false positive results with the PEG 6000 melt coprecipitate formulation. 
In  mice,  necropsy  revealed  a  numerical  increase  in  the  incidence  of  macroscopic  liver  lesions  that 
corresponded  to  an  apparently  higher incidence  of  hepatocellular  tumors  in  males.  The  increase  was 
however  not  statistically  significant  in  the  trend  test  and  the  pair-wise  comparisons.  Further,  no 
consistent pattern of foci was seen. The observed incidence of hepatocellular tumors as well as slightly 
higher incidence of malignant lymphomas is within the high spontaneous variability of these tumors in 
male CD-1 mice.  
The slightly higher incidence of ovarian hemorrhage at 10 mg/kg and above and at 60 mg/kg a higher 
number  of  animals  showing  pigment deposition  as  well  as 
the  higher 
incidences  of 
extramedullary hematopoiesis  in  the  spleen  seen  in  males  may  be secondary  to  the  pharmacological 
mode  of  action  of  rivaroxaban.  Taken  together,  the  data  do  not  support  a  carcinogenic  effect  of 
rivaroxaban. 
In the rat carcinogenicity study, there was an increased number of valvular fibrosis in the heart, both 
in treated males (0/50 [control], 1/50 [low dose], 1/50 [mid dose] and 2/49 [high dose]) and females 
(0/50 [control], 0/50 [LD ], 2/50 [MD] and 4 /50 [HD]). The report states that since the incidence was 
only  marginally  higher  compared  to  control  and  statistical  significance  was  missing  no  toxicologically 
relevance  is  considered.    Although  the  incidence  is  relatively  low,  there  is  a  dose  –related  increase; 
and  there  is  no  case  in  the  control  group  of  either  sex.    Thus,  a  relation  to  treatment  cannot  be 
excluded.  Given  that  this  finding  is  considered  a  safety  concern,  the  Applicant  was  asked  to  further 
address  this  issue  and  submitted  a  review  of  all  repeat  dose  toxicity  data  and  mechanistic  data 
regarding  serotonin  interaction  was  submitted  which  provided  no  support  that  rivaroxaban  induced 
valvular fibrosis.  
All  in  all,  the  different  aspects  addressed  in  the  MAH´s  response  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the 
observed  numerically  increased  incidence  of  valvular  fibrosis  in  rats  most  likely  is  a  finding  reflecting 
the variability of age-related cardiac alterations rather than related to the treatment with rivaroxaban.

The  MAH  has  made  search  of  valvular  heart  disease  and  of  heart  failure  in  the  clinical  trial  database 
and in spontaneous postmarketing reporting. There are no indications of drug induced valvulopathy in 
the clinical data collected so far.  
Thus, there is no need to include ‘valvulopathy’ as a potential or identified risk in the RMP. 
In  high  dose  female  rats,  in  the  pituitary  gland  a reduced  number  of  nodules  and  in  the  ovaries  a 
reduced number of cysts were seen. In the preputial glands of male rats treated at 60 mg/kg, a higher 
number of nodules were observed, but with no evidence of an increased rate of neoplasms. A slight not 
statistically significant numerical increase in adrenal cortical adenomas was observed in females at 20 
and  60  mg/kg.  Fibroadenomas  in  the  mammary  gland  and  squamous  cell  carcinoma  in  the  clitoral 
gland  were  more  often  seen  in  females  at  60  mg/kg,  but  did  not  reach  the significance  levels  for 
common tumors. An increased pigment deposition was seen in several organs at 60 mg/kg most likely 
represent residues of mode of action-related bleedings. None of these findings suggest a carcinogenic 
potential for rivaroxaban. 
In conclusion, rivaroxaban did not show a carcinogenic potential when tested in mice and rats up to 60 
mg/kg.  
2.3.7.4. 
 Reproduction Toxicity 
In the initial Marketing authorisation application, reproductive toxicity studies have been performed in 
rat  and  rabbit  and  the  results  suggest  a  teratogenic  effect  at  clinically  relevant  exposure.  All  effects 
have  been  proposed  to  be  related  to  rivaroxaban’s  pharmacodynamic  activity  and  pregnancy  and 
breastfeeding have been contraindicated. The latter is endorsed while an additional true placenta and 
teratogenic effects of rivaroxaban cannot be excluded.

Since  in  Phase  I  the  action  limit  of  the  predicted  environmental  concentration  in  surface  water 
(PEC surface  water)  is  exceeded  the  applicant  submitted  a  Phase  II  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA) 
for the active ingredient rivaroxaban.  
As the action limit for the PEC surface water of 0.01µg/l is exceeded the applicant provided a detailed Phase 
II  environmental  risk  assessment  for  the  active  ingredient  rivaroxaban.  On  the  basis  of  the  provided 
dataset the applicant concluded that no risk for the environment can be expected from the introduction 
of rivaroxaban from Xarelto. 
To complete the environmental risk assessment the applicant was asked more information in particular 
in relation to the log Pow determination, the water-sediment study and the studies according OECD 201 
and 209. On the basis of the correct octanol/water partition coefficient of log POW = 1.5, no study on 
bioaccumulation  in  fish  (OECD  305)  is  required  according  to  the  ERA  guideline  CHMP/SWP/4447/00 
(June 2006), because the trigger value for this study of log POW = 3 is not reached. 
In  conclusion,  all  remaining  issues  have  been  addressed  and  the  Applicant´s  responses  were 
considered  acceptable.  As  a  result,  the  data  allow  to  conclude  that  ribaroxaban  does  not  have  a 
potential risk to the environment.  
2.3.9.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  non-clinical  programme  is  comprehensive  providing  a  good  characterisation  of  the 
properties  of  rivaroxaban.  The  majority  of  non-clinical  studies  were  assessed  in  connection  to  the 
previous  approval  of  the  10  mg  tablet  and  together  with  the  new  studies  the  documentation  overall 
support  chronic  treatment  with  the  higher  dose  in  the  sought  indication.  Concerns  were  expressed 
regarding  the  finding  of  valvular  fibrosis  in  the  heart  of  rivaroxaban  treated  animals  in  the  rat 
carcinogenicity  study.  However,  the  observed  numerically  increased  incidence  of  valvular  fibrosis  in 
rats is considered most likely a finding reflecting the variability of age-related cardiac alterations rather 
than related to the treatment with rivaroxaban.  
2.3.10.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The additional non clinical studies submitted to support the additional strengths of 15 and 20 for a new 
indication provide additional information on the use of rivaroxaban in animal studies. Overall the data 
support the use in humans for the proposed indication for VTE and DVT treatment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  applicant  has  submitted  additional  clinical  pharmacology  studies  characterising  the  dose 
proportionality  of  the  15  and  20  mg  new  strengths  compared  to  the  approved  10  mg  tablet  and 
characterising the food effect on the 20 mg strength. The application also included a population PK and 
PK/PD evaluation of phase II studies in patients treated for DVT.  
Table  1  displays  additional  clinical  pharmacology  studies  submitted  with  this  application. 
Pharmacokinetic  data  were  also  obtained  in  patients  from  two  phase  II  studies.  Plasma  rivaroxaban 
concentrations were measured using a validated HPLC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters in 
phase  I  studies  were  calculated  by  non-compartmental  methods.  Nonlinear  mixed  effects  modelling 
(population pharmacokinetic analysis) was used to evaluate pharmacokinetics in patients.

The  absolute  bioavailability  of  the  20  mg  strength  in  fasting  state  was  previously  determined  to  be 
66%.  A  high-calorie,  high-fat  breakfast  increased  rivaroxaban  AUC  by  39%  and  Cmax  by  76%. 
Absorption  was  delayed  in  the  fed  state  showing  a  lag-time  of  approximately  1.5 h  and  a  delay  in 
median  tmax  of  about  1.25 h.  The  food  effect  on  the  15  mg  strength  was  not  evaluated  in  a  specific 
study.  However  a  cross-study  comparison  suggests  an  18%  increase  in  AUC  and  86%  increase  in 
Cmax with food. 
The  assessment  of  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  application  concluded  that  rivaroxaban  displays 
dose dependent pharmacokinetics with less than proportional increase in AUC as the dose is increased. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/301607/2011

The non-linearity is most marked in fasting state, where the non-linearity starts at doses above 15 mg. 
However, in fed state the pharmacokinetics seemed to be fairly proportional up to 30 mg in Caucasian 
volunteers  and  to  20  mg  in  Japanese  and  Chinese  volunteers.  A  ceiling  effect  with  no  additional 
increase in exposure with increased dose is reached at doses of about 50 mg. 
The additional Study 12362 demonstrated dose proportional increase in AUC and Cmax with increased 
dose in the dose range 10 to 20 mg in fed state. There is a trend for less than proportional increase in 
Cmax with dose and slightly longer t1/2 at the 20 mg dose, reflecting a slightly slower absorption with 
increased  dose  and  the  absorption  rate  limited  elimination.  The  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis 
included dose as a covariate with a relative bioavailability of 79% at the 20 mg dose compared to the 
10 mg dose, hence suggesting a small deviation from dose proportionality in patients. 
The  population  PK  and  PK/PD  analysis  included  870  patients  from  the  phase  II  ODIXa-DVT  and 
EINSTEIN-DVT studies. The PK of rivaroxaban was described by an oral, one-compartment model, with 
clearance  (CL/F),  volume  of  distribution  (V/F)  and  a  first-order  absorption  rate  (ka)  as  parameters. 
Rivaroxaban clearance was estimated to be 5.67 L/h, with inter-individual variability of 39.9%. Volume 
of  distribution  was  estimated  to  be  54.4  L,  with  inter-individual  variability  of  28.8%,  similar  to  that 
observed with healthy subjects. Age and serum creatinine were identified patient covariates potentially 
affecting rivaroxaban clearance and body weight and sex as covariates on volume of distribution.  
The  covariates  identified  are  expected  from  previous  studies  in  special  populations  and  the  covariate 
effects observed are of a similar magnitude as previous population PK analysis in surgery patients and 
of  a  somewhat  smaller  magnitude  than  specific  studies  in  special  populations.  Hence,  there  are  no 
unexpected results from this analysis.  
Special populations 
As  the  current  application  concerns  use  of  rivaroxaban  in  a  new  population  at  a  higher  dose,  the 
treatment recommendations in special populations was reviewed in particular in eldery, in patients with 
moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  or  moderate  hepatic  impairment  and  in  patients  with  a 
combination of risk factors that increase rivaroxaban exposure.  
The applicant proposes a contraindication in patient with coagulopathy including cirrhotic patients with 
Child Pugh B. It is agreed that cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B (moderate hepatic impairment) have 
increased risk for bleeding and should be contraindicated. The increased exposure in the elderly is to a 
large extent caused by reduced renal function. Consequently dose reduction based on age alone is not 
considered  needed.  The  SPAF  population  consists  mostly  of  elderly  patients  and  there  is  extensive 
experience  in  treating  elderly  patients  with  rivaroxaban  20  mg  q.d.  In  patients  with  moderate  or 
severe  renal  impairment  (creatinine  clearance  15-49  ml/min),  the  applicant  recommends  a  reduction 
of the maintenance dose from 20 mg once daily to 15 mg once daily  
Based  on  PK  modelling,  the  exposure  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  treated 
with  15  mg  q.d.  and  with  co-administration  of  moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitors  is  in  a  similar  range  as 
patients  with  mild  renal  impairment  and  no  CYP3A4  inhibitors  where  extensive  safety  information  is 
available. Hence, it is agreed that caution is not needed in these patients. However, additional increase 
in  exposure  is  expected  in  patients  with  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors.  Caution  is  therefore  advised  in 
patients  with  renal  impairment  co-administered  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (e.g.  chlarithromycin, 
telithromycin).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Rivaroxaban  is  a  competitive,  selective  and  direct  oral  factor  Xa  inhibitor.  Activation  of  factor  X  to 
factor  Xa  plays  a  central  role  in  the  cascade  of  blood  coagulation.  Inhibition  of  factor  Xa  would  be 
expected to inhibit the amplified burst of thrombin generation induced when the coagulation system is 
activated  both  when  the  activation  is  initiated  by  the  internal  (“surface  activation”)  or  external  rout 
(tissue factor and factor VIIa). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In phase I dose escalation studies, factor Xa was inhibited in a dose-dependent way over the complete 
dose range closely following the pharmacokinetic profiles of rivaroxaban. The other global clotting tests 
PT,  aPTT,  and  Heptest  were  also  affected  in  a  dose-dependent  way.  The  10  mg  dose  of  rivaroxaban 
resulted  in  a  maximal  reduction  of  the  factor  Xa  activity  by  33%  (SD  5.1%),  and  a  maximal 
prolongation  of  PT  of  38%.  The  20  mg  dose  of  rivaroxaban  resulted  in  a  maximal  reduction  of  the 
factor Xa activity by 55%, and a maximal prolongation of PT of 98%. All pharmacodynamic parameters 
investigated  in  phase  I  trials  correlated  closely  with  the  plasma  concentrations.  Rivaroxaban  has  no 
influence on antithrombin III levels or factor II, thus supporting the direct mechanism of inhibition of 
factor Xa in humans. 
Results of investigations of the ETP (endogenous thrombin potential) have shown that single doses of 5 
and 30 mg rivaroxaban influence the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the coagulation system. A dose-
dependent influence is noted on lag-time, time to peak, peak level and total amount of the endogenous 
thrombin over time curve. 
Another study identified a prolonged influence of rivaroxaban beyond 24 h on the peak level of the ETP 
as  well  as  lag  time  suggesting  that  pharmacological  effects  may  be  present  beyond  24  hours  after 
doses of 20 mg. 
With  regard  to  secondary  pharmacology  effects  it  can  be  noted  that  neither  preclinical  data  nor  the 
dedicated QT study indicate that rivaroxaban affects QT to any clinically relevant extent. 
From a clinical point of view the primary pharmacology of rivaroxaban has been well characterised. 
Exposure response 
The  relationship  between  plasma  concentration  and  effect  was  evaluated  in  the  population  PK/PD 
analysis of data from the two phase 2b dose-ranging studies. A linear intercept model for PT, an Emax 
model for Factor Xa activity, and a combined linear-Emax model for the HepTest were used. Observed 
rivaroxaban  concentrations  were  used  as  input  in  the  PK/PD  models.  Rivaroxaban  plasma 
concentrations  up  to  700 g/L  correlated  with  PT  in  an  almost  linear  fashion.  The  slope  of  the 
correlation  became  non-linear  at  higher  rivaroxaban  plasma  concentrations.  At  steady  state,  baseline 
PT  was  estimated  to  be  12.5 seconds  and  the  slope  of  the  correlation  was  3.3 seconds/100 g/L.  For 
FXa  the  baseline  FXa  activity  value  differed  somewhat  between  studies  and  study  days  and  ranged 
between  0.9  and  1.1  U/mL  and  the  EC50  of  rivaroxaban  was  376  µg/L  and  Emax  98.4%.  The  PK/PD 
parameter  estimates  for  PT  were  very  similar  in  the  above  analyses  and  those  previously  obtained 
when using Neoplastin in surgery patients. The EC 50 for FXa was somewhat higher than that estimated 
in surgery patients (376 compared to 296 ug/l). 
A post-hoc, exploratory analysis of the relationship between estimated steady-state AUC0-24h, Cmax and 
C trough  and  adjudicated  efficacy  and  bleeding  events  was  evaluated  in  rivaroxaban  treated  subjects 
from  Studies  11223  and  11528  (PH-34764).  The  analysis  included  also  evaluation  of  dose  and 
exposure  categorised  in  low,  middle  and  high  exposure  groups.  The  analysis  suggested  that  the

decrease in incidence of a VTE deterioration until week 12 was best correlated to Ctrough values, while 
any/clinically relevant bleeding events tend to show the most pronounced increase with higher values 
of  C max.  To  some  extent  this  evaluation  supports  the  selected  dose.  The  obtained  exposure  response 
relationships suggest that the gain in efficacy with a higher dose than the proposed would be marginal 
while there is an increased bleeding risk at higher exposure. 
Pharmacodynamics when switching from warfarin to rivaroxaban 
A placebo controlled study in healthy males has been performed to investigate the pharmacodynamics 
when switching from warfarin to rivaroxaban. The study was carried out in a 3 group parallel design: 
In treatment group A warfarin was titrated to an INR of 2 to 3, and rivaroxaban was started 24 hours 
after  stopping  of  warfarin.  In  treatment  B  warfarin  was  titrated  to  an  INR  of  2  to  3  and  placebo  was 
started 24 hours after stopping of warfarin. In treatment C rivaroxaban was given without any warfarin 
pretreatment. Rivaroxaban was administered once daily as a 20 mg dose over 4 days (Day 0d to 3d). 
In the warfarin treated groups, warfarin preceded rivaroxaban and placebo and was given in doses of 
2.5  to  15  mg  once  daily  aiming  to  increase  INR  to  values  between  2.0  and  3.0  for  each  subject.  84 
subjects were included in the PK/PD set, 28 subjects per treatment group. 
After switching from steady state warfarin to 20 mg rivaroxaban at INR values between 2.0 and  3.0, 
over-additive  agonistic  effects  were  observed  for  PT  (s)  and  PT  (INR).  PT  prolongation  was  4.4  times 
baseline  (45  seconds)  after  the  switch  compared  to  1.6  times  baseline  (7  seconds)  after  rivaroxaban 
alone. 
INR values above 3.0 were observed in all 28 subjects on Day 0d and remained above this value for a 
mean of 12.6 hours. After dosing on the following Day 1d, 25 subjects showed INR values above 3.0 
which remained there for a mean of 7.5 hours and 8 subjects on Day 2d. After Day 2d, no subject with 
PT INR values greater than 3 was observed. 
Rivaroxaban  enhanced  the  effect  of  warfarin  on  Factor  Xa  activity,  aPTT,  and  ETP.  Combined  effects 
were  additive  for  Factor  Xa  activity  and  roughly  additive  for  ETP  and  aPTT.  Rivaroxaban  induced 
changes were reversible within 24 hours.  
The  Applicant  has  provided  an  update  on  the  development  of  PK/PD  markers  to  be  recommended  in 
clinical use. A prothrombin time assay and a factor Xa inhibition test are the most promising tests that 
after  further  investigations  possibly  could  be  recommended  for  use  in  clinical  routine.  The 
concentrations of rivaroxaban as measured in the clinical trials during treatment for DVT are given in 
the updated SPC. 
Anti-Factor Xa, HepTest and PiCT were not affected by warfarin.  Tests of anti-Factor Xa, HepTest and 
PiCT were capable of detecting rivaroxaban effects independently from warfarin effects. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  applicant  has  provided  additional  studies  evaluating  the  dose  proportionality  of  the  additional 
strengths  and  the  food  effect  on  the  20  mg  strength.  A  population  PK  analysis  provides 
pharmacokinetic  data  in  the  target  population.  These  additional  data  are  considered  adequate  to 
support the use in the new indication. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic documentation is considered sufficient and supports the approval of the two new 
strengths in the proposed indication.

Study  11223  was  a  proof-of-principle  and  dose-ranging  study  in  subjects  with  confirmed  acute 
proximal DVT.  
Study 11528 was a dose-ranging study in subjects with proximal or extensive calf-vein thrombosis (i.e. 
involving at least the upper third part of the calf veins). 
For  both  studies,  the  assessment  of  all  efficacy  and  safety  outcomes  was  done  by  central  and 
independent adjudication committees, which were unaware of treatment allocation. 
In study 11223, the primary efficacy outcome was the response to treatment based on repeat CUS at 3 
weeks.  A  ‘positive  response’  was  defined  as  an  improvement  by  at  least  4  points  in  the  CUS  score 
compared  to  baseline.  Any  confirmed  symptomatic  VTE  (i.e.  recurrent  DVT,  non-fatal  PE  or  fatal  PE, 
including unexplained death for which PE could not be ruled out) up to Day 21 was defined as ‘negative 
response’  
There  were  three  TE  events  in  the  ITT  population  –  1  proximal  DVT  in  the  10  mg  b.i.d.  treatment 
group  and  1  in  the  20  mg  b.i.d.  treatment  group  as  well  as  1  non-fatal  PE  in  the  30  mg  b.i.d. 
treatment group).

The number of events for recurrent DVT or PE or death of any cause up to day 98 was 3, 5, 2 and 8 in 
the 20 mg o.d., 30 mg o.d., 40 mg o.d. and the LMWH/VKA groups respectively. 
Table E5 Incidence rates of clinically relevant bleeding events (major or clinically relevant 
non-major bleedings) 
Final dose regimen chosen 
Thrombus  scores  were  evaluated  with  compression  ultrasonography  (CUS)  in  study  11223  and  with 
CUS and perfusion lung scint (PLS) in study 11528. 
In  the  phase  II  dose-finding  studies,  there  was  no  dose  response  relationship  or  clear  efficacy 
advantage  observed  for  b.i.d.  dosing compared  with  o.d.  dosing  over  the  range  of  rivaroxaban  doses 
tested,  and  no  definitive  difference  between  the  b.i.d.  and  o.d.  regimens  was  seen  in  bleeding 
compared  to  LMWH-VKA,  except  at  40  mg  TDD  or  higher.  The  o.d.  dosing  was  considered 
advantageous  from  a  patient  convenience  and  compliance  perspective.  However,  b.i.d.  dosing  had 
some advantages; steady state was attained earlier, higher trough levels were reached, an improved 
duration  of  anticoagulation  was  noted,  and  a  better  (but  non-significant)  improvement  in  thrombus 
score  was  obtained  with  twice  daily  dosing.  It  was  therefore  determined  that  including  b.i.d.  dosing 
initially in the rivaroxaban regimen for the phase III program could provide the intensification needed 
and  permit  continuous  rivaroxaban  therapy  without  first  requiring  the  use  of  a  heparin  in  the  initial 
acute  DVT  treatment  phase.  Also,  based  on  the  clinical  observations  from  the  phase  II  dose-finding 
trials, it was concluded that the lowest once-daily dose studied (20 mg) should be selected as the dose 
beyond the initial intensification stage for phase III VTE treatment trials. Analysis of the 2 dose-finding 
studies in subjects with acute symptomatic DVT in conjunction with prior knowledge and experience in 
the  field  of  VTE  treatment  indicated  that  rivaroxaban  15  mg  twice-daily  for  an  initial  3-week  period, 
followed  by  once-daily  administration  of  20  mg  for  the  subsequent  treatment  period,  would  be  the 
optimal regimen to study in the phase III program.

In study 11223, a 30% improvement in CUS thrombus score was observed in  53, 48, 38, 52 and 40% 
in  the  10mg  b.i.d,  20mg  b.i.d,  40mg  o.d.,  30mg  b.i.d  and  enoxaparin/VKA  groups,  respectively.  In 
study 11528 the overall improvement rates based on CUS, PLS and symptomatic DVT were 77, 82, 74 
and 69% in the 20mg o.d., 30mg o.d., 40 mg o.d. and the enoxaparin/VKA groups, respectively. The 
lack  of  a  clear  relationship  between  dose  and  efficacy  response  are  commonly  seen  in  dose  finding 
studies within this area. 
There  was  a  slight  tendency  for  increased  bleeding  risks  with  increasing  doses  in  study  11223  with 
numerically somewhat more bleedings with doses equal to or above 40 mg (with an incidence of 2 % 
of major bleedings and an additional 10% of non major bleedings) in comparison with enoxaparin/VKA 
(major  bleedings  0%,  non  major  6%).  With  the  dose  10  mg  b.i.d.  the  bleeding  rates  were  similar  to 
those  in  the  enoxaparin/VKA  group.  In  study  11528  bleeding  rates  were  similar  in  all  treatment 
groups. 
The results of the dose finding studies and arguments for the dose regimen chosen by the Applicant for 
the  phase  III  studies  were  essentially  accepted  at  the  CHMP  advice  discussion  although  it  was  made 
clear that the evidence from the phase II trials was weak. 
2.5.2.  Main studies    
The  clinical  development  program  consists  of  3  studies,  evaluating  the  treatment  of  acute  VTE  (one 
DVT study and one PE study), and one placebo-controlled study focussing on secondary prevention of 
VTE.  
The PE study is still on-going and no data from that study is available for this report. 
Thus, there are two phase III studies supporting the application as summarised in the table below.

3.6.2.1 Pivotal study - study 11702 
Methods/ Objectives 
Study  11702,  which  is  to  be  regarded  as  the  pivotal  study  supporting  this  application,  was  a  multi-
center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active-controlled, event-driven non-inferiority study in 
patients  with  confirmed  (by  venography  or  CUS)  proximal  DVT  without  symptomatic  PE.  A  treatment 
duration of 3, 6, or 12 months was to be decided by the investigators based on perceived risks. 
It  is  to  be  noted  that  patients  with  estimated  creatinine  clearance  <  30  ml/min  or  significant  liver 
disease were excluded. 
Treatments 
Pre-randomization treatment with any anticoagulant was allowed for a maximum duration of 48 hours. 
After randomization, subjects allocated to the rivaroxaban arm received rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily 
for a total of 3 weeks followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily. Subjects allocated to the comparator 
arm  received  enoxaparin  twice  daily  for  at  least  5  days  in  combination  with  VKA  and  continued  with 
VKA  only  after  the  INR  had  been  ≥  2  for  two  consecutive  measurements  at  least  24  hours  apart. 
Warfarin and acenocoumarol were allowed as VKAs. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  objective  was  to  evaluate  whether  rivaroxaban  is  at  least  as  effective  as 
enoxaparin/VKA in the treatment of DVT and secondary prevention of DVT and PE. 
The principal safety objective was the evaluation of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding. 
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE, i.e. the composite of recurrent DVT or 
non-fatal  or  fatal  PE.  All  events  should  be  objectively  verified  by  CUS,  venography,  spiral  CT, 
pulmonary angiography or lung scintigraphy. Fatal PE could also be verified at autopsy. Deaths which 
could  not  be  attributed  to  documented  cause  and  for  which  DVT/PE  could  not  be  ruled  out  was  also 
counted as suspected PE. 
The main secondary efficacy outcomes were recurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all cause mortality (i.e. a 
composite  outcome  where  in  the  primary  efficacy  outcome  fatal  PE  was  substituted  by  all  cause 
mortality). 
Thus  the  endpoints  chosen  are  in  line  with  the  recommendations  in  the  CHMP  Note  for  Guidance 
document. 
Sample size 
The sample size was chosen to demonstrate that treatment with rivaroxaban is at least as effective as 
comparator treatment with enoxaparin/VKA. A total number of 88 events was determined to maintain 
a power of 90% to demonstrate that rivaroxaban is at least as effective as the comparator, considering 
a relative non-inferiority upper CI margin for the hazard ratio of 2.0.

Conduct of the study 
Subjects  in  both  treatment  arms  had  contact  with  the  site  at  fixed  intervals.  At  each  contact,  all 
subjects  were  interviewed  using  a  standardized  outcome  form  for  efficacy  as  well  as  for  bleeding 
events.  Recurrent  VTE  was  more  often  suspected  in  the  rivaroxaban  arm  and  more  events  were 
refuted  in  that  group  by  the  adjudication  committee.  The  reason  for  this  was  probably  a  closer 
supervision  of  the  patients  in  the experimental  arm  by  the investigators  taking  the  open  label  design 
into account. However, the adjudication committee seems to have made the outcome assessment in a 
rigorous manner and it was made blinded.   
Approximately  95%  of  the  patients  in  the  rivaroxaban  group  and  92%  in  the  Enoxaparin/VKA  group 
completed the intended treatment period or had a primary efficacy outcome or died, or the study was 
terminated after the required number of events was reached.  
Baseline data 
The baseline characteristics of the included patients are judged to be sufficiently representative of the 
European target population with 57% males and 43 % females, the mean age was 56 years and 13% 
were  above  75  years  of  age,  the  mean  weight  was  82  kg.  Seven  percent  of  patients  had  moderate 
renal impairment.  
Outcome  data  in  patients  with  several  risk  factors  were  requested  by  the  CHMP  and  such  data  have 
been provided and appropriate recommendations should be implemented in the SPC. 
Results 
Sixty-two  percent  of  patients  had  spontaneous  (idiopathic)  DVT,  20%  had  recent  surgery  or  trauma, 
another 15% had had immobilisation and six percent had use of estrogen containing drugs. Six % had 
active cancer. 
The observed INR measurements within target are given in the table below.

The  proportion  of  observed  INR  within  the  target  range  among  the  VKA  treated  patients  could  be 
judged  to  be  reasonably  representative  for  what  can  be  expected  in  clinical  routine  in  a  DVT 
population.  
The incidence rates of the efficacy events were as follows:

Table E-4      Primary efficacy events, study 11702 
For  the  primary  efficacy analysis,  a Cox’s  proportional  hazard model  stratified  for  intended  treatment 
duration  and  adjusted  for  baseline  malignancy  (yes/no)  fitted  for  the  primary  efficacy  outcome  up  to 
the  end  of  the  intended  treatment  period  was  employed.  The  comparison  of  rivaroxaban  vs. 
enoxaparin/VKA  treatment  yielded  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.680  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI]:  0.443-
1.042). The test for superiority of rivaroxaban was not statistically significant (p = 0.0764). 
Thus,  the  non-inferiority  for  rivaroxaban  as  pre-defined  has  been  convincingly  demonstrated.  The 
results appear consistent for the components of the composite primary end-point. Recurrent non-fatal 
PE  were  numerically  somewhat  more  common  in  the  rivaroxaban  group.  However,  this  was  probably 
due to chance and it is not expected that effective secondary prevention of DVT would not result in a 
similar reduction of PE events. 
The  efficacy  results  were  essentially  consistent  in  subgroups  at  centers  with  different  time  in 
therapeutic range (TTR). However, in centers with highest TTR (>70%) the tendency for better efficacy 
with rivaroxaban was lost. 
The outcome in the Per Protocol population was consistent with that in the ITT population. 
The  Kaplan-Meier  cumulative  event  probability  rates  for  the  primary  efficacy  end-point  were 
numerically lower in the rivaroxaban group than in the enoxaparin/VKA group at each time point up to 
the  end  of  intended  treatment  period  except  for  the  period  up  to  Day  14.  At  day  7  there  were  16 
events  in  the  rivaroxaban  group  versus  11  in  the  enoxaparin  group  and  at  day  14  21  vs  19, 
respectively. The slight numerical imbalance was judged to probably be due to chance.   
It was noted that the majority of patients (73% in the rivaroxaban group) had received LMWH, heparin 
or  fondaparinux  before  diagnostic  procedures  and  before  randomisation.  This  treatment  is  most 
probably not given by random but could be expected to be given to those with a high VTE suspicion or 
with more active disease.

The  relative  efficacy  for  rivaroxaban  as  compared  to  enoxaparin/VKA  was  consistent  in  different 
subgroups  and  in  subgroups  at  different  baseline  risk.  The  relative  difference  between  the  treatment 
groups also appears consistent in different geographical regions. However the overall VTE rates differ 
in different geographical regions, which may be due to differences between the populations recruited.  
A  total  of  446  suspected  episodes  of  recurrent  deep  vein  thrombosis  or  pulmonary  embolism  were 
identified by the investigators. The adjudication committee refuted the diagnosis of recurrent deep vein 
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in 355 cases (193 cases in the rivaroxaban group and 162 cases in 
the  enoxaparin/VKA  group).  A  plausible  explanation  for  the  higher  rate  of  investigator  suspected 
events refuted centrally could be a higher alertness for these patients by the investigators taking the 
open  label  design  into  account.  Other  explanations  have  on  request  by  the  CHMP  been  discussed  by 
the Applicant but appear less plausible. 
The following table summarise the efficacy results from the main study supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Study identifier 
011702 DVT 
Design 
Multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active-controlled, 
event-driven non-inferiority study; central independent adjudication 
committee for suspected clinical outcomes was blinded to treatment 
allocation 
Duration of main phase: 
Duration of Run-in phase:

Analysis description  For the primary efficacy analysis, the time to the first event of the 
composite primary efficacy outcome was analyzed using a Cox’s proportional 
hazards model, with intended treatment duration as stratum and adjusted 
for the baseline presence of malignancy. The rivaroxaban-to-comparator 
hazard ratio was computed with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Based on this model, rivaroxaban was to be considered at least as effective 
as the comparator if the upper limit of the CI was less than 2.0. 
To account for multiple testing, a hierarchical testing procedure was pre-
specified, and comprised non-inferiority and superiority testing for the 
primary efficacy outcome. Furthermore, if non-inferiority for the primary 
efficacy outcome was demonstrated, the principal safety outcome 
(composite of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events), as 
well as the major bleeding outcome were to be tested hierarchically. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes were not included in the hierarchical testing 
procedure. 
3.6.2.2 Supportive study – study 11899 
Methods/ Objectives 
Study  11899  was  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  event-driven, 
superiority  study  for  efficacy.  Subjects  with  a  previous  confirmed  symptomatic  DVT  or  PE  who  either 
had been treated for 6 or 12 months with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or rivaroxaban in study 11702 
or  who  had been  treated  for  6  to  14  months  with VKA  (either  warfarin  or  acenocoumarol)  outside  of 
study 11702 were eligible for this trial. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/301607/2011 
Page 30/49
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After randomization, subjects allocated to rivaroxaban received rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily. Subjects 
allocated  to  placebo  received  a  matching  placebo  tablet  once  daily.  The  treatment  duration  was 
indicated prior to randomization (6 or 12 months) at the investigator’s discretion. 
Outcome/Endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of confirmed recurrent DVT or non-fatal or fatal PE.  
The  study  was  designed  as  an  event-driven  superiority  study  where  all  events  were  evaluated  by  a 
central, blinded, independent adjudication committee. 
Baseline Characteristics 
The  demographics,  baseline  characteristics  and  risk  factors  were  similar  to  the  study  population  in 
study 11702 from which 53% of the included patients were recruited. 
Conduct of the study 
Twenty  six  (26)  %  of  the  patients  did  not  complete  the  planned  treatment  duration    as  the  Sponsor 
terminated  the  study  when  the  pre-planned  number  of  events  had  been  reached.  Another  14  %  had 
shorter  treatment  duration  for  other  reasons  (adverse  events  6.5  vs  3.1%  in  the  rivaroxaban  and 
placebo groups, respectively) or due to primary end-point reached (1.0% vs 8.5%, respectively) or for 
other reasons. 
Results 
Efficacy  data  in  relation  to  number  of  risk  factors  and  in  relation  to  compliance  to  treatment  were 
consistent. More bleedings were noted in patients with poorer treatment compliance in the rivaroxaban 
group  which  was  probably  due  to  more  frequent  interruptions  of  treatment  in  that  group  when  a 
bleeding occurred. 
As  primary  analysis,  a  Cox’s  proportional  hazard  model  stratified  for  planned  treatment  duration  and 
adjusted  for  previous  treatment  was  applied.  The  comparison  of  rivaroxaban  vs.  placebo  treatment 
yielded a hazard ratio of 0.185 (95% CI 0.087-0.393, p < 0.0001) or a 81% relative risk reduction. A 
pre-planned  hierarchy  for  statistical  testing  of  the  three  secondary  efficacy  outcomes  was  applied  in 
the  order  of  secondary  efficacy  outcome  1  to  3,  (see  table  below  for  definitions  and  outcome).  The 
differences  between  the  two  treatment  groups  were  highly  statistically  significant  for  all  three 
secondary efficacy endpoints. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/301607/2011

Table E-5     Efficacy outcome, study 11899 
The  study  provided  clear  evidence  for  the  efficacy  of  rivaroxaban  in  the  secondary  prevention  after 
VTE.  The  net  clinical  benefit  endpoints  combining  efficacy  and  safety  endpoints  appeared  less 
informative as putting equal weight on these different endpoints could be questioned.  
The implications for treatment in clinical routine from this study are less obvious.  
The size of the efficacy is to a large extent dependant on how patients are selected. The study included 
patients at rather different risk. Approximately sixty percent had had an idiopathic DVT/PE, 16% had 
had  more  than  one  DVT/PE  event,  14  %  had  had  a  primary  event  during  immobilisation,  8%  had  a 
known  thrombophilic  condition  and  5%  had  active  cancer.  Thus  it  is  questionable  to  what  extent  the 
population  is  representative  for  a  population  where  treatment  generally  is  discontinued  (as  in  the 
placebo group) or continued for 6 or 12 additional months (as in the rivaroxaban group) or without any 
predefined discontinuation time point. Furthermore no comparison with continued VKA treatment was 
performed.  It  does  not  seem  plausible  however  that  VKA  treatment  would  have  provided  much

additional  benefit.  Another  interesting  aspect  of  the  results  is  the  possibility  to  compare  the  safety 
characteristics of rivaroxaban with placebo in the target population. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
With  regard  to  efficacy  this  application  is  essentially  supported  by  the  results  from  one  pivotal  study 
(11702).  Based  on  the  results  from  this  study  the  Applicant  proposed  a  new  treatment  strategy  of 
acute proximal DVT with rivaroxaban that substitutes well established regimens with initial parenteral 
therapy followed by VKA treatment for secondary prophylaxis that has been in practice for more than 
fifty years.  
Study  11702  is  judged  to  have  been  well  designed  and  well  performed.  The  efficacy  events  were 
centrally  adjudicated  while  blinded.  The  composite  primary  end-point  (recurrent  DVT  or  non-fatal  or 
fatal  PE)  and  prioritised  secondary  endpoint  are  in  line  with  the  CHMP  guidance  document  and  the 
CHMP  considered  that  they  can  be  accepted.  Non  inferiority  of  the  composite  primary  and  secondary 
endpoints has been convincingly demonstrated with a with a hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% CI 0.44-1.04, 
p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Superiority could however not be demonstrated (p=0.076). In addition, 
the  results  appear  consistent  for  different  subgroups  and  the  evidence  provided  by  secondary 
endpoints is supportive.  
Study  11899  was  randomized,  event-driven,  superiority  study  for  efficacy.  Although  double-blind  and 
placebo-controlled it is considered to be primarily supportive from an efficacy point of view since it was 
performed in a population that was not considered to necessarily be in need of prolonged anticoagulant 
treatment.  
The  outcome  of  the  trial  was  heavily  influenced  by  the  selection  of  patients  into  the  study  which 
probably  would  vary  considerably  between  different  investigators.  Nevertheless  superiority  over 
placebo  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  convincingly  demonstrated  and  thus  that  rivaroxaban  is 
effective  in  the  secondary  prevention  of  VTE  is  considered  established.  The  study  also  provided 
evidence for efficacy with regard to secondary prevention of pulmonary embolism.  
The  study  did  not  compare  the  efficacy  with  VKA  treatment  which  would  be  the  alternative  for  the 
majority  of  patients.  However,  the  low  event  rates  observed  in  the  actively  treated  arm  would  be 
expected also with VKA treatment in a population without malignant disease, 
Efficacy  data  from  centers  with  different  quality  of  the  VKA  treatment  measured  as  proportion  of 
patients within the target range were consistent with the overall outcome.  
A majority of patients received LMWH, heparin or fondaparinux for up to 48 hours before rivaroxaban 
treatment  was  started.  It  is,  however,  agreed  with  the  Applicant  that  there  is  little  evidence  that 
supports  a  general  recommendation  for  the  use  of  parenteral  anticoagulants  in  the  initial  phase  of 
acute  treatment.  The  similar  time  of  onset  after  administration  of  the  two  anticoagulants  is  of  vital 
importance for this conclusion. 
Furthermore, the lack of experience of treatment beyond one year needs to be appropriately addressed 
and was further discussed and considered in the product information and in the risk management plan. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Rivaroxaban  could  be  an  attractive  alternative  to  VKA  treatment  which  often  requires  intense 
monitoring  and  is  complicated  by  numerous  drug  interactions.  From  this  practical  perspective 
treatment with rivaroxaban probably offers some advantages.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The  exposure  in  the  phase  II  and  III  trials  within  this  indication  can  be  summarised  in  the  following 
tables. 
Number  of  subjects  valid  for  safety  in  the  dose  finding  studies  (by  daily  dose)  (studies  11223  and 
11528)

subjects valid for safety with rivaroxaban treatment 
Thus,  the  safety  database  contains  approximately  3000  patients  included  in  the  phase  II  and  III 
studies  of  which  more  than  400  patients  have  been  treated  for  over  12  months  which  is  considered 
acceptable for approval. 
The demographic profile of the patients valid for safety analysis in the phase III trials is given in the 
table below. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/301607/2011 
Page 34/49
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table S-3 Demographic profile of the patients valid for safety analysis in the phase III trials 
Approximately  46  %  of  the  subjects  were  recruited  in  West  European  countries,  15%  from  Eastern 
Europe,  11%  from  Asia,  8%  from  North  America  and  21%  from  other  areas  (Australia, Brazil,  Israel, 
New Zealand and South Africa). 
Risk  factors  thromboembolism  for  recurrent  VTE  were  similar  in  both  studies.  Idiopathic  DVT/PE  was 
the most frequent one (in the range of 50% in study 11702 DVT and 60% in study 11899), followed by 
previous episodes of DVT/PE (in the range of 20% in study 11702 DVT and 15% in study 11899) and 
immobilisation (in the range of 15% in both studies). 
Almost half of the subjects from study 11702 DVT and 11899 had vascular disorders, mainly related to 
hypertensive disease. Other medical history findings fit into the cardiovascular disease and risk factor 
profile  such  as  diabetes  mellitus  (12%),  ischemic  coronary  artery  disorders  (5%)  and  lipid 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/301607/2011

abnormalities.  The  profile  of  medical  history  findings  is  probably  rather  typical  for  subjects  prone  to 
develop VTE. 
In  accordance  with  the  medical  findings  more  than  50%  of  subjects  received  drugs  for  the 
cardiovascular  system,  primarily  antihypertensive  treatment.  The  use  of  serum  lipid  reducing  agents 
and  drugs  acting  on  the  musculo-skeletal  system  is  also  explained  by  the  co-morbidities. 
Approximately 7 % were on ASA and 9% on NSAID at baseline. 
Adverse events  
A  summary  of  the  most  common  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (at  least  2%  in  any  treatment 
group) by MedDRA system organ class/preferred term is given in the table below. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/301607/2011 
Page 36/49
 
 
 
 
Table S-4 Treatment emergent events in the phase III studies 
Overall,  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  drug-related  AEs  was  in  the  range  of  20%  in  the 
rivaroxaban  treatment  groups  (study  11702  DVT:  23.3%  rivaroxaban  treatment  group  vs.  23.0% 
enoxaparin/VKA;  study  11899:  16.4%  rivaroxaban  treatment  group  vs.  10.7%  placebo).    The 
difference  between  the  rivaroxaban  treatment  group  and  the  placebo  group  is  driven  by  investigator 
reported  bleeding  events  (incidence  of  treatment-emergent  drug-related  bleeding  events  in  study 
11899:  11.0%  rivaroxaban  treatment  group  vs.  6.3%  placebo  group).  The  incidence  of  treatment-
emergent  drug-related  AEs  without  bleeding  events  in  study  11899  was  7.0%  rivaroxaban  treatment 
group vs. 6.1% placebo group. 
The only marked differences from placebo in study 11899 are the higher incidences of gingival bleeding 
and epistaxis in the rivaroxaban group. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/301607/2011

Overall,  the  incidence  of  drug-related  serious  TEAEs  was  in  the  range  of  2%  in  the  rivaroxaban 
treatment  groups  (study  11702  DVT:  2.4%  rivaroxaban  treatment  group  vs.  3.0%  enoxaparin/VKA; 
study 11899: 2.0% rivaroxaban treatment group vs. 0.8% placebo). The incidences of adverse events 
resulting in permanent discontinuation of study drug were similar in the two treatment groups in study 
11702. 
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  serious  TEAEs  in  study  11702  DVT  were:  Rivaroxaban 
treatment group: anemia (0.6%), all other preferred terms had an incidence of < 3 reports 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In  the  safety  population,  93  subjects  died  within  the  study  period  until  last  observation  made.    The 
incidence rate of death was numerically lower in the rivaroxaban group (2.4% [41/1718]) than in the 
enoxaparin/VKA group (3.0% [52/1711]). The numerical difference in death rates between treatment 
groups  until last  observation in favour of  rivaroxaban  may  have been  due  to  chance.  As  judged  from 
the  case  reports  other  causes  of  death  than  VTE,  bleeding  or  treatment  related  complications  seem 
established or probable in the majority of cases. 
Bleedings 
The criteria for major bleeding and clinically relevant bleeding seem appropriate and are essentially in 
line  with  the  recommendations in  the  relevant  CHMP  NfG  document.  They were  prospectively  defined 
as follows 
A major bleeding event was defined as overt bleeding 
• 
• 
• 
associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more or 
leading to a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood or 
that  occurred  in  a  critical  site:  intracranial,  intraspinal,  intraocular,  pericardial,  intra  articular, 
intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal or contributing to death. 
Clinically  relevant  non-major  bleeding  events  were  defined  as  overt  bleeding  not  meeting  the  criteria 
for major bleeding event but associated with 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
medical intervention or 
unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician or 
(temporary) cessation of study treatment or 
discomfort for the subject such as pain or 
impairment of activities of daily life 
The  numbers  and  distribution  of  major  bleedings  and  clinically  relevant  bleedings  in  study  11702  are 
given in the two tables below.

Rectal,  urogenital  bleeding  and  bleedings  from  uterus  that  were  judged  as  clinically  relevant  were 
numerically  more  common  in  the  rivaroxaban  group.  Major  and  clinically  relevant  bleedings  were 
slightly  higher  in  the  rivaroxaban  group  during  the  first  3  months  of  treatment  (6.4  vs  5.8%, 
respectively). However, the differences in total number between the groups were small. 
In  study  11702  a  total  of  433/1718  (25.2%)  subjects  in  the  rivaroxaban  treatment  group  and 
399/1711  (23.3%)  subjects  in  the  enoxaparin/VKA  treatment  group  had  investigator-assessed, 
treatment-emergent  bleeding  events,  most  of  them  were  assessed  by  the  investigators  as  drug-
related. 
The totality of bleeding data, including also mild or trivial bleedings seem to indicate that bleeding was 
somewhat more common in the rivaroxaban treated patients as compared to enoxaparin/VKA treated. 
A  total  of  433/1718  (25.2%)  subjects  in  the  rivaroxaban  treatment  group  and  399/1711  (23.3%) 
subjects  in  the  enoxaparin/VKA  treatment  group  had  investigator-assessed,  treatment-emergent 
bleeding  events,  most  of  them  were  assessed  by  the  investigators  as  drug-related.  However  the 
incidences  of  major  bleedings  did  not  differ  which  to  some  extent  is  reassuring.  The  pattern  of 
bleedings during rivaroxaban treatment seems to differ from what is seen during enoxaparin treatment 
with  more  bleedings  from  gastrointestinal  tract  and  uterine  bleedings,  e.g  for  investigator  reported 
uterus/urogenital bleedings a more marked difference is seen between the treatment groups in study 
11702  with  88  bleedings  in  the  rivaroxaban  group  vs.  38  in  the  enoxaparin/VKA  group  in  female 
subjects below the age of 55.  
Haemoglobin  or  haematocrit  levels  were  not  monitored  during  the  studies.  Thus  the  possibilities  to 
detect clinically silent GI bleedings were limited. 
As  expected  the  bleeding  incidence  was  clearly  higher  in  the  rivaroxaban  group  as  compared  to 
placebo in study 11899, see table below.

Looking  at  bleeding  rates  in  subgroups  it  can  be  noted  that  the  bleeding  rates  in  patients  with 
moderate  renal  insufficiency  was  increased  (10.8%)  as  compared  with  patients  with  normal  renal 
function (7.5%) and also somewhat higher in the rivaroxaban group as compared to the corresponding 
enoxaparin/VKA  group  (7.8%).  In  a  parallel  application  for  rivaroxaban  treatment  in  atrial  fibrillation 
the  Applicant  proposes  a  dose  of  15  mg  o.d.  in  patients  with  moderately  impaired  renal  function.  A 
dose of 15 mg will provide an exposure that is closer to the exposure of 20 mg in patients with no or 
mild renal impairment.  
The  reported  analyses  do  not  indicate  that  there  was  a  difference  in  PT  Neoplastin  values  in  patients 
with bleedings and those without bleedings.  
Hepatic adverse events 
Overall, in study 11702 0.4% (7/1718) of the subjects in the rivaroxaban treatment group had hepatic 
disorder  AEs  resulting  in  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug  compared  with  0.4%  (6/1711) 
subjects  in  the  enoxaparin/VKA  treatment  group.  There  were  no  cases  of  acute  hepatic  failure  in  the 
rivaroxaban treated group. The incidence of ALT elevations were clearly lower in the rivaroxaban group 
than in the enoxaparin AKV group (E.g. >3ULN, 1.5 vs.3.8%).  
The  available  data  so  far  data  does  not  indicate  that  treatment  with  rivaroxaban  is  associated  with 
severe hepatic adverse events. 
There were no indication that rivaroxaban induced ischemic vascular complications, thrombocytopenia 
or pancreatic adverse events. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  database  contains  almost  3000  patients  included  in  the  phase  II  and  III  studies  of  which 
more  than  400  patients  have  been  treated  for  over  12  months.  From  a  safety  perspective  it  is 
considered  valuable  that  the  supportive  study  11899 provides  data  in  comparison  with  placebo.  Thus 
the  experience  should  be  sufficient  to  capture  common  adverse  events  and  to  characterise  bleeding 
risks  in  the  target  population.  The  reported  incidence  of  major  bleedings  was  not  increased  as 
compared  to  enoxaparin/VKA  treatment.  However,  taking  all  available  bleeding  data  including 
bleedings judged as clinically relevant, mild bleedings and investigator reported bleedings into account 
the incidence of bleedings seem to be somewhat higher among the rivaroxaban treated patients. The 
bleeding  pattern  seems  to  differ  from  what  is  seen  during  VKA  treatment  with  a  higher  incidence  of 
mucosal bleedings. The bleeding pattern has been discussed by the Applicant who claimed that there 
are  similarities  in  the  bleeding  pattern  with  what  can  be  seen  in  inherited  fX  deficiency.  It  appears, 
however, reassuring that major or critical bleedings were not more common than with VKA treatment 
in  the  overall  clinical  study  programme.  With  the  applied  study  design  in  the  pivotal  study  occult  GI 
bleedings  were  not  systematically  screened  for.  As  anaemia  was  somewhat  more  common  in  the 
rivaroxaban  group  appropriate  recommendations  for  clinical  and  laboratory  monitoring  should  be 
included in the product information. The dose proposed in moderate renal impairment is questioned as 
the  non-adjusted  dose  proposed  will  provide  increased  exposure  and  a  dose  reduction  should  be 
recommended. 
There  are  currently  no  signals  from  the  studies  in  the  proposed  new  indication  that  treatment  with 
rivaroxaban would be associated with severe hepatic adverse events, thrombocytopenia or pancreatic 
adverse reactions. The post-marketing experience from prophylaxis of VTE in orthopaedic surgery has 
so far not revealed any safety concerns resulting in regulatory actions.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  safety  characteristics  of  rivaroxaban  in  the  targeted  population  have  essentially  been  sufficiently 
characterised. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considers  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  (version  10.0)  as  described  by  the  applicant 
fulfils  the  requirements  and  provides  adequate  evidence  that  the  applicant  has  the  services  of  a 
qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of 
any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

2.8.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), i.e. deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), 
is  a  common  disorder  with  an  annual  incidence  rate  of  approximately  1-2  per  thousand  inhabitants. 
VTE  is  a  burden  for  healthcare  systems  as  it  is  associated  with  high  mortality  and  considerable 
morbidity  in  terms  of  recurrent  VTE,  the  post-thrombotic  syndrome,  and  chronic  thromboembolic 
pulmonary  hypertension.  Treatment  of  DVT  and  PE  aims  at  prevention  of  extension  of  the  existing 
thrombus, as well as prevention of recurrent VTE. 
Standard treatment since many years for acute VTE consists of initial parenteral therapy, including low 
molecular  weight  heparin  (LMWH),  unfractionated  heparin  (UFH)  or  fondaparinux,  overlapping  with  a 
vitamin  K  antagonist  (VKA).  Therapy  with  VKAs  is  challenged  by  the  need  for  ongoing  coagulation 
laboratory  monitoring  as  well  as  by  drug  and  food  interactions.  A  solution  to  some  of  these  issues 
could  come  from  an  oral  anticoagulant  with  predictable  anticoagulant  activity  that  does  not  require 
frequent coagulation monitoring, yet effective as a single agent for acute treatment of VTE as well as 
the continued prevention of recurrent VTE. 
This  application  is  supported  by  one  pivotal  open-label  non-inferiority  study,  (study11702)  which  has 
been well designed and well performed. The study population is considered sufficiently representative 
of  the  European  target  DVT  population  with  regard  to  demographic  characteristics,  concomitant 
diseases  and  VTE  risk  factors.  The  composite  primary  and  prioritised  secondary  endpoints  are 
appropriate  and  in  line  with  the  CHMP  recommendations.  Measures  were  undertaken  to  reduce  the 
potential  for  bias,  all  predefined  efficacy  and  safety  end-points  were  adjudicated  centrally  and  the 
patients  were  followed  on  regular  intervals  with  instructions  to  the  investigators  to  evaluate  key 
symptoms  of  possible  outcome  events.  Also  the  patients  were  informed  on  such  symptoms  in  a 
CHMP assessment report

standardised  way.  Treatment  with  rivaroxaban  when  compared  with  a  well-established  regimen  of 
enoxaparin  and  VKA  was  convincingly  demonstrated  to  be  non-inferior  with  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.680 
(95% CI: 0.443-1.042). The test for superiority of rivaroxaban was however not statistically significant 
(p  =  0.0764).  The  results  were  consistent  in  per  protocol  analyses  and  the  secondary  efficacy  end-
points  supported  the  primary  outcome.  The  results  were  consistent  in  important  subgroups  such  as 
different age, gender, risk factors etc.  
The  supportive  study  (study  11899)  which  compared  rivaroxaban  with  placebo  in  secondary  VTE 
prevention  that  had  had  either  rivaroxaban  or  VKA  and  had  finalised  the  pre-planned  treatment  was 
designed as a double blind study. It provides convincing evidence of the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the 
secondary  prevention  after  an  acute  DVT.  The  same  composite  efficacy  end-point  as  in  the  pivotal 
study  was  used.  Superior  efficacy  of  rivaroxaban  therapy  over  placebo  was  demonstrated  with  a 
hazard ratio of 0.185 (95% CI 0.087-0.393, p < 0.0001) or a 81% relative risk reduction. The results 
of the secondary end-points were supportive.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The optimal duration of therapy has been discussed during the assessment. It was agreed by the CHMP 
that decisions on treatment duration should be based on the accumulated experience from treatment 
with VKA agents together with an assessment of the expected  benefit in the individual patient taking 
the estimated bleeding risk into account.  
It  was  discussed  if  the  initial  treatment  with  parenteral  anticoagulants  that  the  majority  of  patients 
received prior to randomisation could have contributed to the efficacy seen in the rivaroxaban group. It 
is,  however,  agreed  that  there  is  little  in  the  compiled  data  that  supports  a  general  recommendation 
for  the  use  of  parenteral  anticoagulants  in  the  initial  phase  of  acute  treatment.  The  similar  time  of 
onset after administration of the two anticoagulants is supportive of this conclusion. 
The  efficacy  results  were  essentially  consistent  in  subgroups  at  centers  with  different  time  in 
therapeutic range (TTR). However, in centers with highest TTR (>70%) the observed overall tendency 
for  better  efficacy with  rivaroxaban  was  lost.  However,  the CHMP  believed  that  firm  conclusions from 
such subgroup analyses cannot be drawn.  
The size of the effect in the placebo-controlled supportive study is heavily dependent on the VTE risk in 
the  included  patients.  A  substantial  proportion  of  the  included  patients  would  probably  have  been 
considered for prolonged VKA treatment in clinical routine. It appears, however, not plausible that VKA 
treatment would have provided much further benefit. 
If  approved  for  the  proposed  indication  many  patients  will  receive  rivaroxaban  treatment  for  many 
years  and  several  decades.  However  from  an  efficacy  perspective  the  provided  data  for  long-term 
treatment is judged to be sufficient. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The  most  important  observed  adverse  reactions  are  bleedings.  Reported  major  bleedings  were  not 
more common among the rivaroxaban treated patients as compared with the enoxaparin/VKA treated. 
The bleeding pattern seems to differ from what is seen during VKA treatment with a higher incidence 
of mucosal bleedings. The bleeding pattern has been discussed by the Applicant who claims that there 
are  similarities  in  the  bleeding  pattern  with  what  can  be  seen  in  inherited  fX  deficiency.  It  appears, 
however, reassuring that major or critical bleedings was not more common than with VKA treatment in 
the overall clinical study programme. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/301607/2011 
Page 45/49
 
 
 
 
Bleeding rates in patients with moderate renal impairment tended to be increased and this may partly 
be related to a higher exposure of rivaroxaban in this group. A reduced dose is recommended in these 
patients. 
There  are  no  indications  from  the  studies  in  the  proposed  new  indication  that  treatment  with 
rivaroxaban  would  be  associated  with  severe  hepatic  adverse  events.  At  present,  there  are  no 
indications that rivaroxaban would induce thrombocytopenia or pancreatic adverse reactions. 
With  the  exception  of  a  possibly  somewhat  dissimilar  bleeding  pattern  with  a  tendency  for  more 
mucosal bleedings in the rivaroxaban in the pivotal study as compared with the VKA treated group, it 
seems  that  the  safety  profile  can  be  considered  to  be  essentially  similar  for  rivaroxaban  and  VKA 
treatment. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
With the study design in the pivotal study, occult GI bleedings were not systematically screened for. As 
anaemia  was  somewhat  more  common  in  the  rivaroxaban  group  appropriate  recommendations  for 
clinical and laboratory monitoring were included in the product information. 
The preliminary top-line results of the large “Magellan trial” for prevention of VTE in patients with an 
acute medical illness has recently been submitted and show according to the preliminary study results 
a  disturbingly  high  bleeding  incidence  in  the  rivaroxaban  arm.  As  the  population  is  at  least  partly 
overlapping with the target population for the now proposed indication the Applicant was requested to 
discuss the implications of the results for the current application. However, if the imbalance in bleeding 
observed  in  the  heterogenous  population  in  the  “Magellan  trial”  would  reflect  a  true  difference  in 
bleeding  tendency  similar  imbalances  would  have  been  expected  in  the  large  studies  in  other 
applications. Thus the differences seen in the “Magellan trial” may at least partially have been a chance 
finding. 
Limited  experience  from  long-term  treatment  with  rivaroxaban  over  one  year  is  available  and  the 
overall  safety  database  is  still  limited.  Many  of  the  patients  treated  for  secondary  prophylaxis  of  VTE 
can  be  expected  to  be  treated  for  many  years  so  a  well  designed  risk  management  plan  covering 
bleeding  risks  and  also  unexpected  adverse  events  during  prolonged  treatment  was  approved  by  the 
CHMP.  
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The  only  available  major alternative for  oral  long  term  secondary  prophylaxis  after  DVT  today  is VKA 
treatment  from  which  experience  exists  since  several  decades.  VKA  treatment  requires  continuous 
monitoring  and  careful  consideration  of  numerous  possibilities  for  interaction  with  other  drugs  and 
food.  The  quality  of  VKA  treatment  is  varying  between  centers  and  patients  where  lower  quality  is 
associated  with  increased  risks  for  bleeding  and  VTE  recurrences.  A  simpler  and  more  predictable 
alternative for  oral  use  that  would not  need  such intense  monitoring  would  therefore  be  a  potentially 
valuable alternative, especially for patients where VKA treatment is not functioning well.  
VKA therapy, if well performed, is very effective in preventing recurrences after an acute DVT. From a 
pragmatic  point  of  view  recurrences  hardly  occur  if  INR  values  are  kept  within  the  therapeutic  range 
unless  there  is  an  underlying  malignancy.  This  application  is  primarily  supported  by  an  open  label 
comparative  non-inferiority  study  which  has  been  well  designed  and  performed.  It  has  been 
convincingly demonstrated that rivaroxaban is not inferior to the traditional combination of parenteral 
anticoagulants  followed  by  VKA  treatment.  The  tendency  for  more  frequent  mucosal  bleedings  is  of 
some concern that, however, that is judged to be manageable with adequate clinical monitoring. That

major bleedings or bleedings at critical sites were not higher among the rivaroxaban treated patients is 
also reassuring.  
An available oral alternative to LMWH, heparin or fondaparinux injections in the acute phase could also 
be advantageous in some situations if carefully managed, e.g. allowing earlier discharge from hospital 
even if it could be argued that compliance to treatment may be higher if the drug is administered by 
health care professionals in this critical phase. 
The overall safety profile is probably comparable with that of VKA treatment. However the limited long 
term safety data should be further reviewed and assessed in the ongoing clinical studies together with 
post marketing experience data.  
2.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The value of an alternative with reduced need for monitoring, simpler dosing and reduced interaction 
potential  than  currently  required  for  VKA  treatment is  considered  to  outweigh  the  perceived  potential 
risks with rivaroxaban treatment. 
2.8.2.  Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that 
- pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns.  
- the following additional risk minimisation activities were required:  
  A Patient alert card and a Prescriber guide are included for the VTE treatment indication. 
2.9.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit risk of rivaroxaban in the treatment of DVT and PE is considered positive. 
2.10.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus  
that the risk-benefit balance of Xarelto in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and prevention 
of  recurrent  DVT  and  pulmonary  embolism  (PE)  following  an  acute  DVT  in  adults  was  favourable  and 
therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  extension  of  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the 
following conditions

The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance presented in Module 1.8.1 of the 
Marketing Authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the medicinal product is on the 
market. 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as 
agreed in the RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any subsequent 
updates of the RMP agreed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). 
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the 
updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR). 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
  When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, 
Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities 
  Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency. 
PSUR  
The PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a half-yearly cycle until otherwise agreed by 
the CHMP. 
  Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of 
the medicinal product 
The MAH shall provide an educational pack, targeting all physicians who are expected to prescribe/use 
Xarelto, prior to the launch of the new indication for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 
prevention of recurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) following an acute DVT in adults. 
This educational pack is aimed at increasing awareness about the potential risk of bleeding during 
treatment with Xarelto and providing guidance on how to manage that risk. 
The MAH must agree the content and format of the educational material, together with a 
communication plan, with each national competent authority in the Member States prior to distribution 
of the educational pack in their territory.  
The physician educational pack should contain: 
 
 
 
The Summary of Product Characteristics 
Prescriber Guide 
Patient Alert Cards 
The Prescriber Guide should contain the following key safety messages: 
  Details of populations potentially at higher risk of bleeding 
  Recommendations for dose reduction in at risk populations 
  Guidance regarding switching from or to rivaroxaban treatment  
  The need for intake of the 15 mg and 20 mg tablets with food 
  Management of overdose situations 
  The use of coagulation tests and their interpretation 
  That all patients should be provided with a Patient alert card and be

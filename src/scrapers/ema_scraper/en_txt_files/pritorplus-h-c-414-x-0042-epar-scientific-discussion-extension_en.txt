Introduction 
PritorPlus is a fixed dose combination of telmisartan and hydrocholorothiazide (HCTZ) approved via 
the centralised Procedure on 19 April 2002. Telmisartan is an orally effective, specific angiotensin II 
receptor antagonist whereas HCTZ is a diuretic belonging to the family of thiazide diuretics; both are 
indicated  in  the  treatment  of  essential  hypertension.  HCTZ  is  the  subject  of  a  Ph.  Eur.  and  U.S.P. 
monograph. 
the  fixed  dose  combinations  of  40mg 
In  Europe 
telmisartan/12.5mg  HCTZ  and  80mg 
telmisartan/12.5mg  HCTZ  are  approved  for  the  treatment  of  essential  hypertension  indicated  in 
patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on telmisartan alone. 
The MAH applied for an extension to the marketing authorisation in order to introduce a new strength 
of 80mg telmisartan/25 mg HCTZ of layered tablet. The strength 80mg telmisartan/25 mg HCTZ (2x 
40mg/12.5mg tablets) has been developed to optimise treatment compliance. It is indicated in patients 
whose  blood pressure  is  not  adequately  controlled on  PritorPlus 80mg/12.5mg  or  patients who  have 
been previously stabilized on telmisartan and HCTZ given separately. It was authorised in the US on 
19 April 2004. 
The Applicant has provided quality and clinical information to support the commercialisation of the 
new strength, whilst a reference to the first MAA is made for the pre-clinical documentation. 
Two Scientific Advices concerning this strength were received from EMEA in September  2004 and 
the  follow-up  in  July  2006  respectively.  Data  submitted  are  in  line  with  the  Scientific  Advices 
received; in particular as the pivotal efficacy trial was conducted with the production scale commercial 
products the applicant did not add new bioequivalence (BE) data for this line extension. Furthermore, 
the applicant can now prove the interchangeability of 2x 40mg telmisartan/12.5mg HCTZ tablets vs. 1 
80mg telmisartan/25 mg HCTZ tablet with clinical data. 
Two  randomised  double-blind  placebo-controlled  clinical  trials  have  been  performed  vs.  160mg 
valsartan/25mg  HCTZ fixed dose combination and vs. placebo in hypertensive patients with stage 1 
and 2 hypertension in the US. These trials had identical design, entry criteria, and endpoints, as well as 
comparable study population. Trial 502.421 was performed with two tablets 40mg telmisartan/12.5mg 
HCTZ as trial medication and trial 502.476 with one tablet 80mg telmisartan/25 mg HCTZ (in both 
trials once daily administration in the morning).  
For  the  establishment  of  the  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  fixed  dose  combination  80mg 
telmisartan/25  mg  HCTZ,  data  of  12 clinical  trials  performed  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate 
hypertension  were  used  (see  table  1  below).  The  core  clinical  development  programme  consisted  of 
the  pivotal  trial  502.480  and  its  follow-up  study  502.491,  which  were  designed  and  conducted 
following the Scientific Advice obtained from the EMEA in 2004. Supportive evidence comes from 
10 trials  investigating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  free  and  fixed-dose  combination  80mg 
telmisartan/25  mg  HCTZ.  In  accordance  with  the  proposed  indication  for  the  new  strength,  the 
submission focused on the comparison of the approved fixed dose combination 80mg telmisartan/12.5 
mg HCTZ with the new fixed dose combination 80mg telmisartan/25 mg HCTZ. 
There is no paediatric development program.

Quality aspects 
Introduction 
PritorPlus is presented as a two-layered tablet for oral use. The two strengths approved of PritorPlus 
(telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide)  are  40/12.5 mg  and  80/12.5  mg.  This  is  an  application  for  a  new 
strength of PritorPlus 80/25 mg which has been developed to optimize treatment.  
The new strength is based on the formulation of the 80/12.5 mg strength with only minor differences 
between the compositions of the hydrochlorothiazide layer of the newly developed 80/25 mg strength 
and the 80/12.5 mg strength.  
Drug Substance 1 (Telmisartan) 
The data provided in section 3.2.S for the active substance telmisartan is based on the data registered 
for the related strengths of telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide 40/12.5 mg and 80/12.5 mg.

•  Manufacture 
Telmisartan is synthesised in 4 steps from 3 starting materials. 
•  Specification 
The active substance specification and analytical methods are the same as those currently approved for 
the authorised strengths of telmisartan/ hydrochlorothiazide.  
Batch  analyses  data  on  three  batches  of  telmisartan  manufactured  at  each  of  the  proposed 
manufacturing sites were provided. The results show that all batches conform to the specification.  
•  Stability 
Based on the updated stability data provided by the MAH the proposed re-test period can be accepted, 
without any storage conditions. 
Drug Substance 2 (Hydrochlorothiazide) 
Hydrochlorothiazide is a pharmacopoeial active substance.  The information provided in section 3.2.S 
is  based  on  the  European  Pharmacopoeial  monograph  for  hydrochlorothiazide,  as  well  as  the 
Certificates of Suitability provided by the two alternative manufacturers of the active substance. 
•  Manufacture 
The information on the manufacture of hydrochlorothiazide is provided in the CEP. 
•  Specification 
The active substance specification and analytical methods have been assessed during the certification 
procedure. 
As a request of the CHMP, the MAH provided validation data for the laser diffraction method used for 
the control of the particle size of hydrochlorothiazide since this is not considered to be guaranteed by 
the CEP.  
•  Stability 
The stability of hydrochlorothiazide is also been assessed during the certification procedure and a re-
test period has been granted. 
Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
The strategy behind the development of the telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide 80/25 mg tablet was the 
s
ame as that used in the manufacture of the currently marketed 80/12.5 mg and 40/12.5 mg strengths.  
The  formulation  has  been  developed  as  an  oblong-shaped  bilayer  tablet,  composed  of  a  white 
telmisartan  layer  and  a  yellow  hydrochlorothiazide  layer.  The  qualitative  composition  of  the 
telmisartan layer is identical to the corresponding telmisartan layer of the currently marketed strengths 
and is compressed to the double weight of the 40 mg telmisartan layer. Only minor differences exist 
between the composition of the hydrochlorothiazide layer of the newly-developed 80/25 mg strength 
a
nd the currently registered 80/12.5 mg. The main differences are as follows:  
− 
Increase in hydrochlorothiazide and consequent reduction of lactose monohydrate 
Page 4 of 23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
−  The colouring pigment has been changed from red to yellow iron oxide to allow for a better 
differentiation between strengths.  
In  conclusion,  the  formulation  of  the  newly  developed  80/25  mg  layered  tablet  is  similar  to  the 
existing 80/12.5 mg dosage strength. 
•  Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients used in telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide tablets are of human or animal origin, 
except  for  lactose  monohydrate.  Information  is  available  from  the  suppliers  of  lactose  monohydrate 
that the lactose is derived from milk from healthy animals in the same conditions as milk collected for 
human  consumption,  in  accordance  with  the  CPMP  “Note  for  Guidance  on  Minimizing  the  risk  of 
Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  via  Human  and  Veterinary  medicinal 
Products”. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  manufacturing process of Telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide 80/25 mg tablets is divided into four 
stages, as described below: 
(1)  Manufacture of the intermediate product Telmisartan SD granulate  
(2)  Manufacture of the final blend for the Telmisartan layer 
(3)  Manufacture of the final blend for the Hydrochlorothiazide layer  
(4)  Manufacture of the Telmisartan/Hydrochlorothiazide layered tablets 
The  manufacturing  process  is  similar  to  the  already  approved  telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
strengths,  exception  being  stage  3  where  a  new  granulation  method  for  the  hydrochlorothiazide  has 
been adopted.  
The validation of the manufacturing process was performed on three full scale batches. Batch analysis 
results  indicate  that,  as  for  the  already  authorised  strengths  of  telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide,  the 
finished product can be reproducibly manufactured according to the finished product specifications.  
• 
Product Specification 
The product specifications are based on the registered specifications for the two strengths marketed as 
well as derived from the release and stability data obtained from development and stability batches of 
the new strength of the telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide tablets (80/25 mg). The specifications include 
tests  for  appearance,  identification  of  telmisartan  (HPLC)  and  hydrochlorothiazide  (HPLC),  assay 
(HPLC),    water  content  (Karl  Fisher),  hardness,  degradation  products  (HPLC),  dissolution,  content 
uniformity,  identification  of  the  dyes  (yellow  iron  oxide)  and  microbial  quality.  All  analytical 
procedures have been adequately described and validated. 
•  Stability of the Product 
The  stability  studies  were  performed  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines.  Accelerated  and  long-term 
stability  data  was  provided  for  three  production-scale  batches  of  telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide 
80/25 mg  tablets,  packaged  in  aluminium  blister  packs,  stored  for  24  months  under  long-term 
conditions (25°C/60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated test conditions (40°C/75% RH). 
The results showed that the new strength satisfy all shelf-life acceptance criteria.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide  (80/25  mg)  has  been  developed  based  on  the  already  authorised 
80/12.5  mg  and  40/12.5  mg  strengths.  The  composition  of  the  new  strength  is  similar  to  the 
80/12.5 mg  strength.  There  are  only  minor  differences  between 
the 
hydrochlorothiazide layers.  
the  compositions  of

The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  product  quality 
characteristics,  as  already  demonstrated  for  the  approved  strengths,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the new strength should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Since  the  approval  of  PritorPlus  in  2002  (40mg/12.5mg  and  80mg/12.5mg)  no  new  non-clinical 
toxicological, toxicokinetic and pharmacological studies have been performed with either telmisartan 
or the fixed combination telmisartan/HCTZ.  
Reference  is  made  to  the  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetic,  and  toxicology  data  for  the 
current  approved  strengths,  generated  previously,  and  filed  under  the  approved  marketing 
authorisation for the current PritorPlus strengths. 
In  the  following  particular  emphasis  is  placed  on  specific  non-clinical  aspects  of  the  new  strength 
80mg telmisartan/25 mg HCTZ. 
Pharmacology 
The  pharmacological  properties  of  telmisartan  alone  and  in  combination  with  HCTZ  are  well 
characterised.  The  data  were  assessed  in  support  of  the  approved  marketing  authorisation  for  the 
current strengths of PritorPlus.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The  pharmacodynamics  of  both  telmisartan  and  HCTZ  are  both  well  characterised.  The  studies  for 
telmisartan included in vitro and in vivo studies in rodents, guinea pigs, rabbits and dogs. Data from in 
vitro studies supported that telmisartan is a potent specific antagonist of the angiotensin II subtype 1 
(AT1)  receptor  (Ki  =  3.7  nM).  Repeated  administration  of  3  mg/kg/day  of  telmisartan  for  5  days  to 
conscious,  chronically  instrumented  spontaneously  hypertensive  rats  (SHR)  reduced  mean  arterial 
blood  pressure  (MAP)  significantly  and  persistently  with  a  maximum  decrease  in  MAP  of  about 
36 mmHg.  Telmisartan  induced  an  increase  of  both  plasma  renin  activity  and  plasma  angiotensin  II 
concentrations.  
HCTZ  reduced  blood  pressure  in  volume-dependent  and  in  salt-induced  hypertension,  as  well  as  in 
renin-dependent hypertensive rat models. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies of telmisartan were performed in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs. Telmisartan 
was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in all species (tmax values were 2 hours in mice, rats and 
dogs and 7 hours in rabbits). Bioavailability was 56-75% in mice, 66% in rats and 14-22% in dogs.  
The metabolism of telmisartan was similar in all species and consisted mainly of glucuronidation to a 
1-O-acylglucuronide.  Telmisartan  is  glucuronidated  by  a  member  of  the  UGT1-gene  family  of  the 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. The major route of elimination of orally or intravenously administered 
telmisartan was via the faeces (> 98% of the dose) via biliary elimination of the 1-O-acylglucuronide 
telmisartan.  Only  very  small  amounts  (<  1%)  of  the  dose  underwent  a  renal  elimination.  The  major 
portion of the compound is excreted within 24 hours after oral administration.  
HCTZ  is  not  metabolised  but  is  eliminated  rapidly  by  kidney.  At  least  61%  of  the  oral  dose  is 
eliminated as unchanged drug within 48 hours. 
Toxicology 
The  toxicity  and  safety  profiles  of  the  individual  compounds  telmisartan  and  HCTZ  in  animals  and 
man are well known. All observed adverse effects in kidney of rats and dogs (increase of blood urea 
nitrogen,  plasma  creatinine,  serum  potassium  and  renal  juxtaglomerular  hyperplasia)  and  GI  tract 
lesions in rats (erosions and ulcers) following high level exposure of telmisartan are species-specific, 
Page 6 of 23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reversible  and  attributable  to  the  exaggerated  pharmacodynamic  activity  in  normotensive  animals. 
Gastric  mucosal  changes  can  be  prevented  by  oral  saline  supplementation.  All  these  adverse  effects 
are  also  known  from  Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme-inhibitors  (ACE-inhibitors)  and  other 
Angiotensin  II  Antagonists  indicating  a  class  effect.  In  clinical  and  observational  studies  the  safety, 
tolerability  and  efficacy  of  telmisartan  was  confirmed  in  a  diverse  patient  population  with  arterial 
hypertension under  conditions  of normal  clinical  practice.  There  was  no  evidence  for  an  increase  of 
gastric or duodenal ulcer or other gastrointestinal pathologies attributable to telmisartan.  
Chronic overdosing of rats and dogs with HCTZ resulted in a loss of electrolytes, e.g. hypokalaemia 
and urinary calculi associated with renal changes (tubular degeneration and interstitial fibrosis) due to 
persistent diuresis. 
In addition to the full toxicity package with the individual compounds, acute and specific oral repeat-
dose toxicity studies (26 week rat and dog, teratogenicity rat) were performed with the combination 
telmisartan/HCTZ 
interaction  and/or 
potentiation.  However,  no  mutagenicity,  carcinogenicity,  fertility,  pre-  and  postnatal  or  safety 
pharmacology studies were conducted with the drug combination. 
to  specifically  address  questions  of  any 
toxicological 
Co-administration  of  telmisartan  and  HCTZ  resulted  in  a  slightly  increased  AUC  in  rats  but  not  in 
dogs. However, human data did not show any significant pharmacokinetic interaction following single 
doses of telmisartan and HCTZ.  
Due to the different mode of action of the individual drugs telmisartan or HCTZ, different metabolic 
pathways  and  different  toxicological  target  organs  in  animals,  no  new  manifestations  of  toxicity 
including  any  off-target  organ  toxicity  were  seen  for  the  combination.  The  observed  main  adverse 
effects  (GI  and  renal  changes)  are  predominantly  induced  by  telmisartan.  All  effects  are  associated 
with the exaggerated pharmacodynamic activity of T in normotensive animal models and also reported 
for ACE-inhibitors and other angiotensin II antagonists (class effect) without any clinical relevance at 
therapeutic use. This is supported by short- and long-term clinical studies. 
In  rats  the  maximum  dose  used  in  the  fixed  combination  was  50  telmisartan/15.6  HCTZ  mg/kg  in 
26wks study, corresponding to a Cmax (ng/ml) of 16.6 telmisartan/2.7 HCTZ and to AUC (ng.h/ml) of 
62.2telmisartan/8.4HCTZ.  In  dogs  the  higher  doses  used  were  4  telmisartan/1.25  HCTZ  mg/kg  in 
26wks study, corresponding to a Cmax (ng/ml) of 577 telmisartan/563 HCTZ and to AUC (ng.h/ml) of 
2253 telmisartan/1734 HCTZ. 
Based  on  the  available  toxicity  studies  (26  weeks)  in  rats  and  dogs  and  the  clinical  studies  in 
volunteers (drug-drug interaction) and patients, the exposure at the high doses was estimated for co-
administration of T/H based on body weight, Cmax and AUC and is shown in TABLE C: 
Page 7 of 23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following repeat oral dosing with telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide at the highest dose in dogs and rats 
for 26 weeks, the exposure (Cmax) was 24/17-fold (rat) and 0.9/3.8- fold (dog) higher compared with 
the systemic exposure in human at the 80 mg/25 mg dose. The corresponding AUC-values exceeded 
human exposure by 17/8- (rat) and 1/1.5- fold (dog).  
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Applicant  submitted  an  environmental  risk  assessment  showing  no  significant  concerns  for  the 
aquatic compartment due to the use of telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide 80mg/25mg tablets. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
No additional non-clinical studies have been performed for the new strength 80mg/25mg. In rats the 
maximum dose used in the fixed combination was 50 temisartan/15.6 HCTZ mg/kg in 26wks study, 
corresponding  to  a  Cmax  (ng/ml)  of  16.6  telmisartan/2.7  HCTZ  and  to  AUC  (ng.h/ml)  of  62.2 
telmisartan/8.4 HCTZ. In dogs the higher doses used were 4 telmisartan/1.25 HCTZ mg/kg in 26 wks 
study, corresponding to a Cmax (ng/ml) of 577 telmisartan/563 HCTZ and to AUC (ng.h/ml) of 2253 
telmisartan/1734HCZT.  Following  repeat  oral  dosing  with  telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide  at  the 
highest dose in dogs and rats for 26 weeks, the exposure (Cmax) was 24/17-fold (rat) and 0.9/3.8- fold 
(dog)  higher  compared  with  the  systemic  exposure  in  human  at  the  80mg/25mg  dose.  The 
corresponding AUC-values exceeded human exposure by 17/8- (rat) and 1/1.5- fold (dog). 
The statement in SPC section 5.3. has been revised accordingly for the new strength of the fixed dose 
combination  (80mg/25mg):  “No  additional  preclinical  studies  have  been  performed  with  the  Fixed 
Dose  Combination  product  80mg/25mg.  Previous  preclinical  safety  studies  performed  with  co-
administration  of  telmisartan  and  hydrochlorothiazide  in  normotensive  rats  and  dogs  in  doses 
producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range, caused no additional findings 
not  already  observed  with  administration  of  either  substance  alone.  The  toxicological  findings 
observed appear to have no relevance to human therapeutic use.”  
On the basis of the existing non-clinical experimental data it cannot be excluded that with the increase 
from 12.5 to 25mg HCTZ a negative impact on the safety of the fixed-dose combination 80mg/25mg  
in hypertensive patients might be observed. Nevertheless clinical data appear sufficient to accept the 
proposed new dose strength of 80mg telmisartan/25mg HCTZ.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Page 8 of 23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  core  clinical  development  programme  consisted  of  the  pivotal  trial  502.480  and  its  follow-up 
study 502.491, which were designed and conducted following the Scientific Advice obtained from the 
EMEA in 2004. Supportive evidence comes from 10 trials investigating the efficacy and safety of the 
free and fixed-dose combination 80mg/25mg. 
The  clinical  trial  data  were  collected  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  EMEA  guidelines,  particularly 
CPMP/EWP/238/95  Rev.  1  and  2  and  CPMP/ICH/541/00.  The  database  contains  data  from  645 
patients exposed to the free- or fixed-dose combination (FDC) of 80mg/25mg for at least 6 months and 
251  patients  exposed  to  80mg/25mg  for  at  least  1  year;  280  patients  were  exposed  to  the  FDC  
80mg/25mg for at least 6 months. Additional active-controlled studies with long-term exposure to the 
FDC  80mg/25mg  were  not  expected  to  reveal  new  information  since  this  application  is  a  line 
extension  of  an  already  approved  product.  In  addition,  the  to-be-marketed  formulation  is  already 
registered  and  has  been  used  in  clinical  practice  in  the  USA  since  2004  without  relevant  safety 
concerns, as documented in periodic safety update reports. 
For the establishment of clinical efficacy and safety of the FDC 80mg/25mg, results from all trials that 
specified the concomitant use of 80mg telmisartan and 25mg hydrochlorothiazide have been evaluated 
(see table 2).

fixed  dose  combination  of 
METHODS 
It  was  a  non-responder,  filter-design  trial  directly  comparing  the  FDCs  T80/H25  and  T80/H12.5. 
Patients  had  to  have  an  inadequately  controlled  blood  pressure  (BP)  on  existing  antihypertensive 
treatment before enrolment into the study. Inadequate control was defined as seated DBP ≥95 mmHg 
on  1  current  antihypertensive  medication  or  DBP  ≥90 mmHg  on  2 or  more  current  antihypertensive 
medications. After 6 weeks of open-label treatment with 80mg/12.5mg, patients who did not respond 
adequately,  i.e.  had  a  DBP  ≥90 mmHg,  were  randomised  to  either  continue  with  T80/H12.5  or  to 
receive T80/H25 for 8 weeks. Additional antihypertensives were not allowed during the run-in and the 
randomised treatment periods. 
Study Participants  
Male or female patients (≥ 18Years of age) who had been diagnosed with essential hypertension and 
currently  taking  between  1  and  3  antihypertensive  medications  at  a  stable  dose  for  at  least  4  weeks 
before  visit  1  were  considered  for  randomisation.  Further  inclusion  criteria  were  a  not  adequately 
controlled  BP  on  existing  antihypertensive  treatment  before  study  entry  or  failure  to  respond 
adequately to 6 weeks treatment with T80/H12.5 FDC therapy. 
Pregnant  or  breast-feeding  women  as  well  as  women  of  child-bearing  potential  not  practising  birth 
control  were  not  eligible  for  study  entry.  Also  patients  with  a  known  or  suspected  secondary 
hypertension, a mean SBP ≥ 200mmHg at the end of the run-in treatment period, clinically significant 
hepatic impaired or severely renal impaired were excluded form the study. Additional main exclusion 
criteria  comprised  patients  post-renal  transplant  or  with  only  one  functioning  kidney,  clinically 
relevant  hypokalaemia  or  hyperkalaemia,  uncorrected  volume  or  sodium  depletion,  primary 
aldosteronism,  hereditary  fructose  intolerance,  history  of  drug  or  alcohol  dependency  within  the 
previous 6 months and chronic administration of any medication known to affect BP (other than the 
trial  medication.  The  conditions  of  concomitant  therapy  with  lithium,  cholestyramine  or  colestipol 
resins, known allergic hypersensitivity to any component of the formulations under investigation and 
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy had to be considered for exclusion.

Treatments 
During  the  run-in  phase,  all  patients  received  the  FDC  T80/H12.5,  one  tablet  per  day.  During  the 
randomised phase, 2 treatments were administered to the patients, either T80/H12.5 FDC or T80/H25 
FDC. Active study drugs were administered in a double-dummy fashion as tablets. Thus, during the 
randomised  phase,  each  patient  took  one  tablet  of  active  drug  and  one  placebo  tablet  matching  the 
alternative active treatment every day. All tablets were taken orally, once daily in the morning.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate that a fixed-dose combination of telmisartan 80 
mg plus HCTZ 25 mg (T80/H25) was superior in reducing BP after 8 weeks compared with a fixed 
dose  combination  of  telmisartan  80  mg  plus  HCTZ  12.5  mg  (T80/H12.5)  in  patients  who  failed  to 
respond adequately treatment with T80/H12.5. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in trough seated (i.e. at 24 hours after last dose) 
DBP  after  8  weeks  of  randomised  treatment  or  at  last  trough  observation  during  the  double-blind 
treatment period (i.e. last trough observation carried forward), as analysed by ANCOVA. 
Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in trough seated SBP, trough standing SBP and 
DBP, proportions of patients achieving DBP control, DBP response and SBP response and proportions 
of patients with optimal, normal, high-normal and high BP. The efficacy endpoints were assessed after 
8  weeks  of  double-blind  treatment  or  at  last  trough  observation  during  the  double-blind  treatment 
period (i.e. last trough observation carried forward). 
The safety and tolerability of T80/H25 were compared with that of T80/H12.5. Safety and tolerability 
were measured by assessment of physical examination findings, heart rate, laboratory parameters, 12-
lead ECG data and reported adverse events. 
RESULTS 
Of  the  971  patients  treated  with  run-in  medication,  713  patients  were  randomised  and  treated  with 
double-blind medication. Of the 687 patients evaluable for efficacy, 340 patients had been randomised 
to T80/H25 and 347 to T80/H12.5. The frequency of discontinuations was low in both treatment arms 
with 1.2% for T80/H25 and 2.3% for T80/H12.5.  
The  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics. 
The overall mean age was 57.2 years. The majority of the patients were male (56.8%) and non-black 
(96.9%).  Almost  all  patients  (98.7%)  had  previously  received  treatment  with  antihypertensive 
medications.  The  mean  BPs  at  the  time  of  randomisation  were  147.9/95.2  mmHg  in  the  T80/H25 
group and 147.4/95.0 mmHg in the T80/H12.5 group. 
The  adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline  to  end  of  treatment  for  DBP  and  SBP  are  presented  in

(Figure 2). For all responder criteria with the exception of DBP control, the p-value for the comparison 
between treatment groups was <0.05.

STUDY 502.491 
An  open-label  follow-up  trial  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  chronic  administration  of  the  FDC  of 
telmisartan  80mg  plus  hydrochlorothiazide  25mg  alone  or  in  combination  with  other  hypertensive 
medications in patients with hypertension 
METHODS 
Study Participants  
A total of 432 patients were included into the interim analysis and received at least one dose of the 
open-label treatment (FDC T80/H25).   
Male or female patients (≥ 18Years of age) who had been randomised to the preceeding trial 502.480 
and  had  completed  that  trial  within  14  days  prior  to  visit  1  of  study  502.491  were  considered  for 
inclusion in the study. Also the inclusion criteria as for trial 502.480 were applicable. 
Patients who discontinued study 502.480 because of an adverse event or any other reason, or where 
during the preceeding trial of any medical condition was developed which could be worsened by the 
study treatment were excluded. In addition, most of the exclusion criteria of trial 502.480 were also 
applicable. 
Treatments 
All patients received T80/H25 in an open-label fashion for a period of 6 months, one tablet per day. 
The tablets were taken orally, once daily in the morning. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of the FDC T80/H25 alone or 
in  combination  with  other  antihypertensive  medications  during  open-label,  follow-up  treatment 
(6 months) in patients who completed the preceding trial (502.480). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving DBP control (defined as seated DBP 
<90  mmHg  under  trough  conditions,  i.e.  24  hours  after  last  dose)  after  6  months  of  treatment  with 
Page 14 of 23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
T80/H25 or at last trough observation during the treatment period (i.e. last trough observation carried 
forward). 
Secondary  endpoints  included  change  from  baseline  in  trough  seated  DBP  and  SBP,  proportions  of 
patients achieving DBP response and SBP response, and proportions of patients with optimal, normal, 
high-normal  and  high  BP.  Further  secondary  endpoints  were  proportion  of  patients  requiring 
additional antihypertensive therapy to achieve DBP control, the additional reduction in BP by the use 
of  additional  antihypertensive  therapy  and  time  to  starting  additional  hypertensive  therapy.  The 
efficacy  endpoints  were  assessed  after  6  months  of  treatment  (i.e.  last  trough  observation  carried 
forward).  Baseline  was  defined  as  baseline  of  the  preceding  trial  (mean  DBP  and  SBP,  response 
endpoints) or end of the preceding trial (mean DBP and SBP). 
The safety and tolerability of T80/H25 over 6 months were assessed by physical examination findings, 
measuring heart rate and laboratory parameters, 12-lead ECG data and reported adverse events. 
RESULTS 
During the preceding trial 502.480, 48.1% had been treated with the FDC T80/H12.5 and 51.9% had 
been  treated  with  the  FDC  T80/H25.  Overall,  92.8%  completed  the  trial  and  7.2%  discontinued  the 
trial  prematurely.  The  majority  of  the  trial  population  was  male  (55.6%)  and  white  (90.0%);  6.9% 
were Asian and 3.0% were black. The mean age of the patients was 57.6 years and the mean duration 
of  hypertension  was  7.7  years.  The  proportion  of  patients  taking  additional  antihypertensive 
medication at some stage during this open-label trial was 17.4%. 
By the end of the preceding trial (502.480), 50.8% of the patients entering trial 502.491 had achieved 
DBP control; based on previous treatment in trial 502.480, 206 (50.0%) patients treated with the FDC 
T80/H12.5 and 220 (51.6%) patients treated with the FDC T80/H25 had achieved DBP control. At the 
end of trial 502.491, the proportion of patients achieving DBP control increased to 71.6%. 
The proportions of patients with DBP control at the end of the preceding study and during the present 
study are summarised in the following table 3. 
Table 3 
At  the  end  of  the  preceding  trial,  the  mean  trough  SBP/DBP  was  142.3/89.1  mmHg  for  patients 
entering trial 502.491. After 6 months of treatment with the FDC T80/H25, the mean trough SBP/DBP 
decreased further by 5.2/.3.7 mmHg to 137.0/85.4 mmHg.  
Mean  trough  seated  DBP  and  SBP  with  mean  changes  from  the  end  of  study 502.480  are  shown  in 
table 4 below.

Table 4 
The  SBP/DBP  changes  from  the  last  visit  of  the  run-in  period  of  trial  502.480  to  the  end  of  trial 
502.491 were ─11.3/─9.6 mmHg. The DBP and SBP response rate was analysed with respect to the 
baseline of the preceding trial.  
Table 5 
The response rate increased from 53.4% to 73.6% for DBP and from 55.5% to 76.5% (140/10 mmHg) 
and 46.9% to 66.5% (140/20 mmHg) for SBP by the end of this trial. Most of the BP response was 
achieved within the first 3 months. 
By  the  end  of  trial  502.480,  9.7%  of  the  patients  had  achieved  an  ‘optimal’  or  ‘normal’  BP  and  a 
further  20.9%  had  moved  into  the  ‘high-normal’  BP  category.  Further  improvements  were  observed 
during trial 502.491 with 18.5% of patients achieving ‘optimal’ or ‘normal’ BP, and a further 33.8% 
achieving ‘high-normal’ BP at the end of the study. The mean exposure was 170.2 days (24.3 weeks) 
with 84.5% of the patients being exposed for at least 24 weeks and 31.7% for at least 26 weeks.  
Of the 426 patients who completed the study 74 (17.4%) took additional antihypertensives during the 
treatment phase. Of the 74 patients 39 had been treated with T80/H12.5 and 35 with T80/H25 in the 
preceding trial. The proportion of patients with DBP control increased from 20.5% prior to the intake 
of the new therapy to 63.0% at the end of the study.

•  Supportive studies 
Double-blind placebo-controlled forced-titration trials 
Trials 502.421 and 502.476 were two large, double-blind, forced-titration studies performed in USA of 
identical  design,  entry  criteria,  and  endpoints.  These  studies  supplied  short-term  efficacy  data  for 
T80/H25 in comparison with placebo and valsartan (V) 160/H25. Patients were randomised in a 4:4:1 
ratio  to  telmisartan,  valsartan,  or  placebo.  After  a  2-week  initial  monotherapy  period,  patients  were 
treated with the combination therapies (or placebo) for 6 weeks. Additional antihypertensives were not 
allowed.  In  study 502.421,  the  daily dose  in  the  T  arm  was  taken  as  2  tablets  of  the  approved  FDC 
T40/H12.5,  whereas  trial  502.476  used  the  to-be-marketed  FDC  T80/H25.  Therefore,  these  2  trials 
also serve to demonstrate the clinical equivalence of the 2 posologies. 
2121  patients  were  evaluated  for  efficacy  (942  on  T80/H25,  952  on  V160/H25,  227  on  placebo). 
Overall, 3.9% of the patients discontinued the studies prematurely. The higher discontinuation rate in 
the  placeb
o  group  (12.8%)  was  mainly  due  to  AEs  (worsening  of  disease  under  study)  and  lack  of 
efficacy. 
The  objective  of  these  trials  was  to  show  that  telmisartan  80  mg  /hydrochlorothiazide  25  mg 
(T80/H25)  is  superior  to  placebo  in  lowering  seated  trough  cuff  blood  DBP  and  SBP,  and  poss
ibly 
superior to V160/H25 in lowering DBP and SBP in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.. 
As  regard  the  502.421  study,  for  the  primary  endpoint,  the  adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline  in 
seated trough SBP/DBP were −24.0/−17.6 mmHg for T80/H25 compared with −4.4/−6.8 mmHg for 
placebo  (both  p-values  <0.0001).  The  mean  changes  in  the  reductions  of  SBP/DBP  for  T80/H25  in 
comparison  with  the  FDC  V160/H25  were  −24.0/−17.6  mmHg  for  T80/H25  compared  with 
−21.2/−16.1  mmHg  (with  the  adjusted  mean  differences  being  -1.5  mmHg  for  DBP  (p=0.0096)  and 
-2.8  mmHg  for  SBP  (p=0.0026),  DBP  control  was  achieved  by  70.9%  of  patients  treated 
with 
T80/H25, 67.0% of patients treated with V160/H25, and 28.3% of patients treated with placebo.  
The results of study 502.476 for the primary endpoint, were −24.6/−18.2 mmHg for the FDC T80/H25 
compared  with  −4.1/−6.1  mmHg  for  placebo  (both  p-values  <0.0001).  The  mean  changes  in  the 
reductions of SBP/DBP for the FDC T80/H25 was  −22.5 mmHg while for the FDC V160
/H25 was -

DBP control was achieved by 77.3% of patients treated with T80/H25, 71.1% of patients treated with 
V160/H25,  and  32.8%  of  patients  treated  with  placebo.  DBP  and  SBP  response  was  achieved  by 
86.5%  and  91.0%  of  patients  treated  with  T80/H25,  by  81.9%  and  86.9%  of  patients  treated  with 
V160/H25, and by 40.3% and 38.7% of patients treated with placebo. 
In  both  studies  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  during  the  randomised  treatment  period  were 
headache and dizziness. During study 502.421, two patients, both randomised toT80/H25, had SAEs 
that  were  considered  possibly  drug-related;  one  patient  experienced  diverticulitis  and  hypokalaemia 
(initial potassium level was 2.6 mEq/L with repeat levels of 2.6 and 3.1 mEq/L following treatment 
with  a  potassium  supplement)  and  another  patient  was  admitted  to  hospital  with  uncontrolled 
hypertension and chest pain. Two patients died during the study 502.476; one 75-year old woman died 
 the placebo run-in phase, and another woman, aged 63 years, died in 
of myocardial infarction during
the  post-study  period  of  unknown  causes,  6 days  after  completing  the  trial.  Both  deaths  were  not 
considered to be drug-related.  
nd  502.216  were  3  long-term  dose-titration  trials  comparing 
The  studies  502.210,  502.214,  a
telmisartan  with  enalapril,  lisinopril  and  with  atenolol,  respectively,  with  and  without  the  add-on 
therapy with hydrochlorothiazide. 
Titration  was  started  with  low  doses  of  the  monotherapies,  which  were  to  be  increased  with 
5 and H25. Medication was to be up-titrated at pre-defined time points and 
subsequent addition of H12.
only  if  the  target  BP  (<90 mmHg  DBP)  had  not  been  achieved.  No  additional  antihypertensive 
medications were allowed. 
The  pooled  analysis  of  these  studies  was  descriptive  and  evaluated  only  patients  who  had  stayed  at 
H12.5  as  final  treatment.  The  mean  age  was  63.6  years  and  was 
least  14  days  on  T80/H25  or  T80/
substantially  higher  than  in  the  other  analysis  sets  because  of  trial  502.210  that  was  performed  in 
patients of at least 65 years of age. 
In  these  titration-to-response  trials,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  received  T80/H25  increased  over 
time.  Of  the  patients  treated  with  a  combination  of  T/H  as  final  treatment,  35.9%  took  T80/H25  as 
their final treatment. The mean time on the final treatment was 84.3 days for T80/H25 and 103.8 days 
for T80/H12.5. Over the complete treatment periods, i.e. from study start to end of treatment, patients 
with final treatment T80/H25 achieved somewhat smaller BP reductions (20.3/13.2 mmHg) than the 
patients on T80/H12.5 as final treatment (23.7/14.9 mmHg). This was to be expected, since patients 
receiving  T80/H25  were  a  negative  selection,  i.e.  those  who  failed  to  achieve  BP  control  on 
monotherapy or lower dose diuretic combinations. In these patients the inc
remental effect of the up-
titration  f
  T80/H12.5  to  T80/H25  was  a  BP  reduction  of  7.0/4.8  mmHg  from  last  value  on 
T80/H12.5 o last value on T80/H25; this is shown in the following table 8.

•  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The primary source of evidence for the positive benefit risk balance of this line extension comes from 
studies 502.480 and 502.491. Two double-blind, forced-titration trials (502.421 and 502.476, EFF-3) 
add  efficacy  data  for  T80/H25  in  comparison  with  placebo  and  V160/H25.  Further  supportive 
evidence  was  obtained  in  8  titration-to-response  trials,  either  in  a  double-blind,  active-controlled 
fashion (502.210, 502.214, 502.216; EFF-4) or in open-label, uncontrolled, long-term trials (502.219, 
502.220, 502.221, 502.228, 502.260; EFF-5).  
All 12 trials used comparable inclusion and exclusion criteria that included a representative population 
of  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hypertension  but with  limited  comorbidities.  Patients  had  to  be  at 
Page 18 of 23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
least  18  years  of  age  and  had  to  have  a  diagnosis  of  mild  to  moderate  essential  hypertension.  The 
requirement of DBP ≥90 mmHg or DBP ≥95 mmHg to 114 mmHg was used in most of the studies. 
Furthermore, an upper limit for systolic BP (SBP) was defined, e.g. 200 mmHg.  
Women who were pregnant or breast feeding, or not using adequate contraception were excluded as 
were  those  with  severe  renal  or  hepatic  impairment,  hypo-  or  hyperkalaemia,  angioedema, 
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or haemodynamically relevant stenosis of the aorti
c or mitral 
valve, drug or alcohol dependency, or intolerance to any ingredient of the trial medications. 
The pooled analysis included 3591 patients with a mean age of 55.0 years. Approximately 80% of the 
patients were younger than 65 years of age and 57.1% of the patients were male. The majority of the 
an  body  mass  index  (BMI)  was  30.8  kg/m2.  The  mean 
patients  were  non-black  (81.8%)  and  the  me
duration of hypertension was about 8 years.  
BP was measured using a standard sphygmomanometer and was determined 20 to 30 hours after the 
last administration of trial medication to be considered as ‘trough’ measurement. Trial medication was 
to be administered once daily in the morning. In all trials, DBP and/or SBP at trough levels were the 
main efficacy vari
ables, either as absolute changes from baseline or based on several DBP and/or SBP 
response criteria. 
Primary endpoints were specified in the protocols of the controlled trials 502.480, 502.421, 502.476, 
502.210,  502.214,  and  502.216,  an
d  for  the  uncontrolled  trial  502.491  but  not  in  the  open-label 
titration-to-response trials (EFF-5).  
In  the  randomised,  double-blind,  controlled  studies  502.480  (EFF-1),  502.421  and  502.476  (EFF-3), 
the primary endpoint was the change from baselin
e in trough seated DBP (and SBP for 502.421 and 
502.476) after 8 weeks of randomised treatment.  
Studies  502.421  and  502.476  employed  a  hierarchical  testing  procedure.  First  the  superiority  of 
T80/H25  against  placebo  in  the  reduction  of  trough  seated  DBP  and  then  SBP  was  tested  and 
thereafter,  assuming  superiority  was  established
,  the  non-inferiority  in  DBP  and  then  superiority  in 
DBP and SBP against V160/H25 was evaluated. 
The  double-blind,  randomised,  titration-to-response  trials  (502.210,  502.214,  502.216;  EFF-4) 
compared the efficacy of 2 titration regimens, based on either T/H or a comparator/H. The definition 
of primary endpoints in these studies varied considerably. In the 502.210 trial, the primary endpoint 
was the change from baseline in trough supine DBP and SBP. The primary endpoint of trial 502.214 
was  the  proportion  of  patients  who,  after  12  weeks  of  titration,  entered  the  maintenance  period  and 
whose final trough supine DBP after 60 weeks of randomised treatment was <90 mmHg without the 
use of H. In trial 502.216, the primary efficacy endpoint was DBP response after 26 weeks based on a 
3-level  rating  scale  with
  categories  ‘full’,  ‘partial’,  and  ‘minimal/no’  DBP  response,  using  a 
proportional odds model. 
In the uncontrolled trial 502.491, the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving trough 
seated  DBP  control  (
DBP  <90  mmHg)  at  the  end  of  the  6-month  treatment  period,  analysed  by 
descriptive statistics. 
Overall,  the  results  for  the  primary  endpoints  showed  either  clear  clinical  benefits  for  a  T80/H25-
based treatment compared with T80/H12.5, V160/H25, and placebo or demonstrated similar efficacy 
ing  T80/H25)  and  active  comparator-based  treatment 
for  a  T/H-based  treatment  regimen  (includ
regimens (ACE-inhibitors
 or beta-blockers).

Safety data from 1
were submitted.  
2 clinical trials investigating T80/H25 or T80/H12.5, as previously listed in Table 1 
The main objective of these safety analyses was to provide information for an adequate understanding 
of  the  safety  profile  of  T80/H25  when  used  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hypertension. 
Comparative  data  from  2  studies  with  T80/H25,  V160/H25,  and  placebo  were  also  included. 
bination 
Additionally,  the  safety  profile  of  the  FDC  T80/H25  was  compared  with  the  free  com
T80/H25. The evaluation was based upon all available information relevant to patient safety. 
Page 19 of 23 
 
 
On 19 July 2004 the applicant requested scientific advice for the development of the FDC T80/H25. 
EMEA suggested that the following specific information be provided: 
- Is there a higher incidence of hypokalaemia, palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias including tachycardia 
and bradycardia, and erectile dysfunction including impotence on treatment with T80/H25 compared 
with T80/H12.5? 
-  Does  treatment  with  T80/H25  result  in  an  increased  occurrence  of  laboratory  abnormalities  and 
possibly  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities  compared  with  T80/H12.5?  Laboratory 
parameters of special interest were plasma potassium, uric acid, and triglycerides 
Based  on  the  review  of  data  presented,  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  adverse  event 
profiles of T80/H25 and T80/H12.5 were detected. No specific increased incidence was identified for 
all adverse events, in particular for those effects indicated by EMEA. No additional safety issues were 
identified during the assessment of this application. 
Discussion on the clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  results  for  the  primary  endpoints  showed  clear  clinical  benefits  for  a  T80/H25-based 
treatment  compared  with  T80/H12.5, V160/H25,  and  placebo  or  demonstrated  similar  efficacy  for  a 
T/H-based  treatment  regimen  (including  T80/H25)  and  active  comparator-based  treatment  regimens 
(ACE-inhibitors or beta-blockers). 
Based  on  the  review  of  data  presented,  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  adverse  event 
profiles of T80/H25 and T80/H12.5 were detected. No specific increased incidence was identified for 
all adverse events, in particular for those effects indicated by EMEA. No additional safety issues were 
identified during the assessment of this application. 
The  SPC  for  the  T80/H25  strength  in  section  4.1  and  4.2  was  revised  in  order  to  reflect  the  patient 
population studied in the pivotal clinical trials (study 502.480 and 6-month follow up study 502.491). 
The main results of these pivotal clinical trials as well as the pooled analysis of two studies comparing 
T80/H25 with placebo and V160/H25 were included in section 5.1 of the SPC accordingly. 
Section  4.8  of  the  SPC  was  amended  with  the  information  that  the  overall  incidence  and  pattern  of 
adverse  events  reported  with  the  new  strength  T80/H25  was  comparable  with  the  approved  strength 
T80/H12.5.

Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a 
qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of 
any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.   
Risk Management Plan 
The MAA submitted a risk management plan 
After  evaluation  and  assessment  of  all  information  presented  in  this  Risk  Management  Plan,  the 
CHMP considered that for telmisartan/ HCTZ currently no important safety risk could be identified. 
With regard to the highlighted hepatic adverse events (hepatic function abnormal, jaundice and liver 
disorder; all MedDRA PTs), these are not regarded as important safety risks because these events are 
already  listed  as  side  effects  in  the  Company  Core  Data  Sheet.  The  frequencies  of  occurrence  in 
Japanese  and/  or  Asian  patients  are  the  focus  for  these  events.  Nevertheless,  in  the  section  below  a 
summary of actions considered necessary to resolve this safety finding is given. 
Page 20 of 23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The evaluation for important potential safety risks did not result in any notable finding. Based on the 
evaluation  and  assessment  of  the  information  available  the  applicant  concludes  that  no  new  safety 
studies for telmisartan/ HCTZ are required. 
Summary of actions for specific safety concerns 
The  evaluation  of  identified  and  potential  risk  did  not  lead  to  any  medically  relevant  findings. 
However,  a  higher  reporting  of  hepatic  adverse  events  such  as  “hepatic  function  abnormal”, 
“jaundice”  and  “liver  disorder”  have  been  observed  in  one  clinical  trial  (502.516)  performed  with 
telmisartan  in  Japan.  Although  these  hepatic  adverse  events  are  already  listed  as  side  effects  in  the 
Company Core Data Sheet, they are identified as a medically relevant finding due to the potentially 
increased frequency. In order to address this finding adequately, the applicant included it as an action 
item in the Risk Management Plan (see the summary below).

Potential increase of frequency of the following listed side 
effects in Japanese patients: “hepatic function abnormal”, 
“jaundice” and “liver disorder” 
After completion of the Japanese study (502.516) the results will be compared 
with those found in other populations including those in other Asian patients who 
were enrolled into clinical trials. 
In order to allow a conclusive assessment of the results, the ongoing clinical trial 
(502.516) should be completed and, thereafter comparisons with pooled data from 
other clinical trials should be performed. 
The focus of these evaluations should be the comparison of Japanese versus non-
Asian patients. 
All concerned events are already listed in the Company Core Data Sheet. The 
concern to be resolved focuses on the evaluation of different frequencies of the 
events between ethnic groups. 
Dependent on the results of the analysis of the relevant clinical trials the following 
scenarios may be followed: 
1. If the results of the Japanese study are not statistically significant different from 
those from pooled analysis of other clinical trials the Company Core Datasheet 
will not be updated and the issue is considered resolved. 
2. If the results will show statis tically significant differences the Company Core 
Data Sheet will be adapted accordingly. 
After complication of the Japanese study the relevant analyses will be performed.

Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
Telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide  (80/25  mg)  has  been  developed  based  on  the  already  authorised 
80/12.5  mg  and  40/12.5  mg  strengths.  The  composition  of  the  new  strength  is  similar  to  the 
80/12.5 mg  strength.  There  are  only  minor  differences  between 
the 
hydrochlorothiazide layers.  
the  compositions  of 
The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  product  quality 
characteristics,  as  already  demonstrated  for  the  approved  strengths,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the new strength should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The pivotal clinical trials (non-responder study 502.480 and 6 month follow up study 502.491) for this 
line extension project were conducted with the production scale commercial products, therefore there 
was  no  need  to  add  new  biopharmaceutical  data  for  this  submission.  In  particular  no  pivotal  BE 
studies were required. 
Efficacy 
For  the  establishment  of  the  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  fixed  dose  combination  (FDC) 
T80/H25,  data  of  12 clinical  trials  performed  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hypertension  were 
used.  The pivotal clinical trials for this extension application were study 502.480 and 6 month follow 
up study 502.491  
Overall,  the  results  for  the  primary  endpoints  showed  clear  clinical  benefits  for  a  T80/H25-based 
treatment  compared  with  T80/H12.5, V160/H25,  and  placebo  or  demonstrated  similar  efficacy  for  a 
T/H-based  treatment  regimen  (including  T80/H25)  and  active  comparator-based  treatment  regimens 
(ACE-inhibitors or beta-blockers). 
Safety 
No  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  adverse  event  profiles  of  T80/H25  and  T80/H12.5  were 
detected. No specific increased incidence was identified for all adverse events. No additional specific 
safety issues have been identified. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Product Information 
The conclusions drawn for the readability of PritorPlus 80mg/25mg tablets are considered applicable 
to the package leaflets of the other strengths. Also the QRD comments provided during the procedure 
were taken into account for the other approved strengths. 
•  User consultation 
A report on the outcome of the consultation with users to review the readability of the package leaflet 
was submitted during this procedure.  
Review of Protocol 
The user testing of the English language package leaflet was performed in two waves of 10 interviews. 
In addition, a preliminary examination of the package leaflet was carried out in order to identify 
potential problematic sections of the package leaflet. Furthermore, 3 pilot interviews were concluded 
to ensure that the questions in the questionnaire were appropriate for their intended purpose.

A  maximum  of  45  minutes  was  planned  for  each  interview,  normally  lasting  between  20  and  30 
minutes.  The  participants  had  7  to  10  minute  to  familiarise  themselves  and  read  the  PL  before  the 
actual  review.  The  interviewer  asked  to  find  each  item  of  information  and  to  explain  it  in  the 
participant’s own word 
20 adult participants were recruited in two rounds: the mean age was 55 years with a range of 33-80 
(6 < 45  years,  14 >   45  years).  The  target  patient  group  consisted  of  persons  suffering  from 
hypertension  but  not  taking  the  active  substance.  Focus  was  laid  on  elderly  persons  with  lower 
educations, thus reflecting well the patient target group. Gender distribution was well balanced. None 
of the participants had experience with telmisartan or hydrochlorothiazide. 
Questionnaire 
21 questions were asked. The first two questions served as an introduction to the interview and were 
not  included  in  the  evaluation.  The  following  14  questions  which  were  evaluated  addressed  the 
relevant  issues  of  the  package  leaflet.  The  last  5  questions  asked  the  respondents  on  their  overall 
impression of the leaflet, i.e. the design and layout. 
Evaluation of the results  
More than 99% of the information of the PIL was found and 100% of the information was understood 
by  all  participants,  from  which  96.8%  was  understood  in  detail  or  good.  At  least  18  out  of  20 
participants found and comprehended the information necessary to answer each individual question. 
The final result of the readability testing is well over the demanded value of 81% requested by the EC 
guideline. 
The CHMP considered that the user testing provided was adherent to the EC Guideline and the results 
reported met the readability success criteria.  
Risk-benefit assessment 
The applicant has submitted an extension application to the marketing authorisation for a new strength 
(80mg telmisartan/25mg hydrochlorothiazide) of PritorPlus for the treatment of essential hypertension 
indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on  PritorPlus 80mg/12.5mg  or 
patients who have been previously stabilised on telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide given separately. 
Based on the provided data on quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects, the benefit risk assessment is 
considered  favourable.  The  overall  Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  the  new  strength  of  the  fixed  dose 
combination  is  positive  provided  that  the  commitments    with  regard  to  the  qulity  aspects  will  be 
performed accordingly. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion  that  routine  pharmacovigilance  was  adequate  to  monitor  the  safety  of  the  product.    A  Risk 
Minimisation Plan for telmisartan/ hydrochlorothiazide based on the presented and discussed data is 
considered  not  necessary.  However,  the  applicant  will  monitor  the  drug  in  question  and  in  case  any 
new safety risk would be identified will re-evaluate the necessity of a Risk Minimisation Plan. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
risk-benefit  balance  of  the  new  strength  (80mg  telmisartan/25mg  hydrochlorothiazide)  of  the 
PritorPlus  fixed  dose  combination  in  the  treatment  of  essential  hypertension  indicated  in  patients 
whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on  PritorPlus 80mg/12.5mg or patients who have 
been previously stabilised on telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide given separately was favourable and 
therefore recommended the granting of an extension to the marketing authorisation of PritorPlus.

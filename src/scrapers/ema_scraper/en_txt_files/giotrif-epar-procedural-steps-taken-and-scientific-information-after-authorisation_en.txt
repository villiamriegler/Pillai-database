NSCLC patients whose tumours harbour uncommon

three trials (1200.22, 1200.32 and 1200.34). In

of data from a total of 75 TKI-naïve patients with advanced 
(stage IIIb–IV) lung adenocarcinomas harbouring 
uncommon EGFR mutations, which were defined as all 
mutations other than Del 19 and L858R mutations. Patients 
were treated with GIOTRIF 40 mg (all three trials) or 50 
mg (LUX-Lung 2) orally once daily. In patients with 
tumours harbouring either G719X (N=18), L861Q (N=16), 
or S768I substitution mutation (N=8), the confirmed ORR 
was 72.2%, 56.3%, 75.0%, respectively, and the median 
duration of response was 13.2 months, 12.9 months and 
26.3 months, respectively. In patients with tumours 
harbouring exon 20 insertions (N=23) the confirmed ORR 
was 8.7% and the median duration of response was 7.1 
months. In patients with tumours harbouring de-novo 
T790M mutations (N=14) the confirmed ORR was 14.3%

n/a 
The final analysis report with data from study 1200.217 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a 
phase IV study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
afatinib as second-line therapy for patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer harbouring an EGFR mutation who have failed 
first-line treatment with platinum-based 
chemotherapy. Risk Management Plan (version 6.0) 
has been updated accordingly. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
does not indicate a relevantly different adverse event 
profile for afatinib in second-line treatment, as compared 
with first-line treatment. Therefore no amendment to the 
product information was warranted based on these data.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

radiotherapy in primary unresected patients with advanced 
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma showed a higher 
incidence of non-infectious nail disorders among afatinib 
treated patients. In addition, there are reasonable 
mechanistic explanations for this finding with epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) function blockade affecting 
not only the skin, but also skin adnexa. Therefore, based 
on the available evidence, the section 4.8 of the SmPC is 
updated to include the adverse reaction nail disorders with 
a frequency common. The package leaflet is updated 
accordingly.

Limited non clinical and/or clinical activity was observed in

NSCLC tumours with insertion mutations in exon 20. The 
acquisition of a secondary T790M mutation is a major 
mechanism of acquired resistance to afatinib and gene 
dosage of the T790M-containing allele correlates with the 
degree of resistance in vitro. The T790M mutation is found 
in approximately 50% of patients' tumours upon disease 
progression on afatinib, for which T790M targeted EGFR 
TKIs may be considered as a next line treatment option. 
Other potential mechanisms of resistance to afatinib have 
been suggested preclinically and MET gene amplification 
has been observed clinically.

moderate and severe renal impairment in comparison to 
subjects with normal renal function) aimed to allow such 
patients to receive treatment with afatinib by developing 
dosing recommendations, in accordance with FDA 
postmarketing requirements. The trial was also expected to 
confirm whether adjustment of the starting dose of afatinib 
in patients with moderate or several renal impairment is 
required. In the study, exposure to afatinib was found to be 
increased in patients with moderate or severe renal 
impairment. Based on this trial and population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of data derived from clinical trials 
in various tumour types, it is concluded that adjustment to 
the starting dose in patients with mild, moderate or severe 
renal impairment are not necessary, but patients with 
severe renal impairment should be monitored and the dose 
adjusted if not tolerated. Treatment of patients with eGFR 
<15 ml/min/1.73m2 or on dialysis has not been studied 
and therefore treatment with afatinib is not recommended 
for these patients.  
Therefore, the sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated to include the above recommendation regarding 
renal impairment. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly.

Posology 
Treatment  
The dosage in patients who do not require supplemental oxygen is 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg 
of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous injection (see Tables 1 
and 3). See sections 4.4 and 5.1. For these patients only, casirivimab with imdevimab should be given 
within 7 days of the onset of symptoms of COVID-19.  
The dosage in patients who require supplemental oxygen (including low flow and high flow oxygen 
devices, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)) is 4 000 mg of 
casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous infusion (see Table 2 of 
Ronapreve SmPC 120 mg/mL + 120 mg/mL). See section 5.1. 
Prevention 
Post-exposure prophylaxis 
The dosage in adult patients and in adolescent patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 
40 kg is 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous 
infusion or by subcutaneous injection (see Tables 1 and 3). 
Casirivimab with imdevimab should be given as soon as possible after contact with a case of COVID-
19. 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis 
The initial dose in adult patients and in adolescent patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 
40 kg is 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous 
infusion or by subcutaneous injection (see Tables 1 and 3). Subsequent doses of 300 mg of 
casirivimab and 300 mg of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous infusion or by 
subcutaneous injection may be given every 4 weeks until prophylaxis is no longer required. There are 
no data on repeat dosing beyond 24 weeks (6 doses). 
Missed dose  
In case of repeated dosing for pre-exposure prophylaxis, if a dose of Ronapreve is missed it should be 
administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, the schedule of administration should be adjusted to 
maintain the appropriate interval between doses.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants 
Decisions regarding the use of Ronapreve for treatment or prophylaxis should take into consideration 
what is known about the characteristics of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses including regional or 
geographical differences and available information on Ronapreve susceptibility patterns. See section 
5.1. 
When molecular testing or sequencing data is available, it should be considered when selecting 
antiviral therapy to rule out SARS-CoV-2 variants that are shown to have reduced susceptibility to 
Ronapreve. 
Subcutaneous administration for treatment of COVID-19 
The clinical efficacy of Ronapreve when administered by the subcutaneous route for treatment of 
COVID-19 has not been evaluated in clinical trials (see section 5.1). The pharmacokinetics of 
casirivimab and imdevimab in the first 48 hours after subcutaneous administration of 600 mg of each 
monoclonal antibody indicate lower serum exposures compared to intravenous administration of the 
same dose. It is unknown whether differences in initial systemic exposure result in differences in 
clinical efficacy. It is recommended that the subcutaneous route of administration is used only if 
intravenous administration is not feasible and would lead to a delay in treatment. 
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with administration of 
casirivimab and imdevimab (see section 4.8). If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant 
hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate 
appropriate medications and/or supportive care.  
Cases of convulsive syncope have been observed following intravenous and subcutaneous 
administration (see section 4.8). Convulsive syncope should be differentiated from seizures and 
managed as clinically indicated. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been observed with intravenous administration of casirivimab 
and imdevimab.  
IRRs observed in clinical studies were mostly moderate in severity and were typically observed during 
or within 24 hours of infusion. The frequently reported signs and symptoms for these reactions 
included nausea, chills, dizziness (or syncope), rash, urticaria, pruritus, tachypnoea and flushing. 
However, infusion-related reactions may present as severe or life-threatening events and may include 
other signs and symptoms.  
If an IRR occurs, the infusion may be interrupted, slowed or stopped.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. Casirivimab and imdevimab are 
monoclonal antibodies, which are not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes; 
therefore, interactions with concomitant medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are 
substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of casirivimab and imdevimab in pregnant 
women. Animal studies have not been performed with respect to reproductive toxicity. Human 
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placenta. It is unknown whether the 
potential transfer of casirivimab and imdevimab provides any treatment benefit or risk to the 
developing foetus. However, as casirivimab and imdevimab directly target the spike protein of SARS-
CoV-2 and in view of lack of cross reactivity with reproductive or foetal tissues in the tissue cross 
reactivity studies, negative effects on developing foetus are not expected. Ronapreve should be used 
during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the foetus 
considering all associated health factors. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking this medicine, the 
individual should be informed that any potential risk to the foetus is unknown. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether casirivimab and imdevimab are excreted in human milk, but maternal IgG is 
known to be transferred to milk during the first days after birth. As casirivimab and imdevimab 
directly target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and in view of low systemic absorption after oral 
ingestion of antibodies, administration of Ronapreve whilst breast-feeding can be considered when 
clinically indicated.  
Fertility 
No fertility studies have been performed. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ronapreve has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Overall, 8 596 subjects (6 173 via intravenous administration and 2 423 via subcutaneous 
administration) have been treated with casirivimab and imdevimab in clinical trials. 
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions are hypersensitivity reactions, which include 
infusion related reactions (IRRs) and injection site reactions (ISRs).  
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions in Table 3 are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies 
are defined as Very common (≥ 1/10), (Common (≥ 1/100 to 1/10), Uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100),

data are available beyond this dose. 
 8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no known specific antidote for casirivimab and imdevimab overdose. Treatment of overdose 
should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of 
the clinical status of the patient.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immune sera and immunoglobulins, antiviral monoclonal antibodies. 
ATC code: J06BD07  
Mechanism of action 
Casirivimab (IgG1κ) and imdevimab (IgG1λ) are two recombinant human monoclonal antibodies 
which are unmodified in the Fc regions. Casirivimab and imdevimab bind to non-overlapping epitopes 
of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. This prevents RBD binding to 
the human ACE2 receptor, so preventing virus entry into cells.  
In-vitro antiviral activity 
In a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation assay in Vero E6 cells, casirivimab, imdevimab, and 
casirivimab and imdevimab together neutralised SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) with EC50 
values of 37.4 pM (0.006 μg/mL), 42.1 pM (0.006 μg/mL), and 31.0 pM (0.005 μg/mL) respectively. 
Resistance 
There is a potential risk of treatment failure due to the development of viral variants that are resistant 
to casirivimab and imdevimab administered together.  
The neutralising activity of casirivimab, imdevimab and casirivimab and imdevimab together was 
assessed against S protein variants, including known Variants of Concern/Interest, variants identified 
in in vitro escape studies, and variants from publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genome data obtained 
from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Casirivimab and imdevimab 
neutralising activity against the Variants of Concern/Interest are shown in Table 5.

Clinical efficacy 
Treatment of COVID-19 
COV-2067 
COV-2067 was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating casirivimab 
and imdevimab for the treatment of subjects with COVID-19 (symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 
detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-qPCR]) who did not 
require supplemental oxygen and were at increased risk of progression to severe disease. 
In Phase 3 Cohort 1 of this trial, subjects not previously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 were 
randomised within 7 days of symptom onset to a single intravenous infusion of 600 mg of casirivimab 
and 600 mg of imdevimab (n = 1 347), 1 200 mg of casirivimab and 1 200 mg of imdevimab 
(n = 2 036) or placebo (n = 2 009).  
Subjects in Phase 3 Cohort 1 had at least one protocol-listed risk factor for developing severe COVID-
19 (these included age > 50 years, obesity defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, cardiovascular disease 
including hypertension, chronic lung disease including asthma, type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic 
kidney disease including those on dialysis, chronic liver disease, pregnancy and immunosuppressed). 
The median age was 50 years (with 13.1% of subjects aged 65 years or older) and 51.4% of the 
subjects were female. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the 
casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with ≥ 1 COVID-19-related hospitalisation or all-
cause death through Day 29.

(p<0.0001). 
RECOVERY 
RECOVERY is an ongoing multi-centre, randomised, controlled, open-label platform study, 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalised subjects with COVID-19. 
RECOVERY enrolled hospitalised subjects on no oxygen, low or high flow oxygen therapy, non-
invasive or invasive ventilation and ECMO. In this trial, 9 785 subjects in the United Kingdom (UK) 
were randomised to a single IV infusion of 4 000 mg of casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab plus 
usual care (n=4 839) or usual standard of care alone (n=4 946; herein after referred to as usual care 
alone). Subjects could receive between 0 and 4 treatments on top of usual standard of care. 
Subjects had clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and were enrolled 
regardless of the respiratory support required. Baseline serology test results were used to define 
analysis populations. 
At baseline, the mean age was 62 years (with 30% of subjects aged 70 years or older, 11 adolescents 
≥ 12 and < 18 years old were included) and 63% of the subjects were male. Baseline demographics 
and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab, and usual care 
alone, treatment groups. Subjects were enrolled in the study when the B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant was the 
dominant variant in the UK. Respiratory support received by subjects included 7% on no supplemental 
oxygen, 61% on simple oxygen, 26% on non-invasive ventilation, and 6% on invasive ventilation 
(including 17 subjects on ECMO). In subjects who were seronegative at baseline, 10% were on no 
supplemental oxygen at baseline, 66% were on simple oxygen, 21% were on non-invasive ventilation, 
and 2% were on invasive ventilation (including one subject on ECMO). Approximately 94% of all 
randomised subjects received corticosteroids as part of background standard care.  
The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality in all randomised subjects who were 
seronegative at baseline. The results are shown in Table 8.

In seropositive subjects, the 28-day all-cause mortality was 16% (410/2 636) in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab arm and 15% (384/2 636) in the usual care alone arm (rate ratio 1.09 [95% 
CI: 0.94, 1.25]).  
In seronegative subjects aged ≥80 years, 28-day all-cause mortality was 54.5% (126/231) and 57.5% 
(134/233) in the casirivimab+imdevimab and usual care alone arms, respectively (rate ratio 0.97 [95% 
CI: 0.76, 1.25]). Statistical testing of the secondary endpoint was performed outside of the hierarchy 
and is, therefore, considered descriptive. 
The secondary endpoint of discharge alive from hospital within 28 days was more common in the all-
randomised seronegative population treated with casirivimab and imdevimab compared with usual 
care alone (64% vs. 58%; rate ratio 1.19 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.31]), with a 4-day shorter median duration 
of hospital stay (13 days vs. 17 days).  
Among the all-randomised seronegative population not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, 
treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab was associated with a lower risk of progressing to the 
composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (31% vs. 37%; risk ratio 0.83 [95% 
CI: 0.75, 0.92]).  
COV-2066 
COV-2066 was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating casirivimab 
and imdevimab for the treatment of hospitalised subjects with COVID-19 on low flow oxygen devices 
(e.g. by face mask or nasal cannula) or no supplemental oxygen. In this phase 2/3 trial, 1 197 subjects 
had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result at baseline and were randomised 1:1:1 to a single 
intravenous infusion of 1 200 mg of casirivimab and 1 200 mg of imdevimab (n=406), 4 000 mg of 
casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab (n=398), or placebo (n=393), with all subjects receiving 
casirivimab and imdevimab, or placebo in addition to the usual standard of care for COVID-19. The 
overall sample size was smaller than anticipated due to the early study termination following several 
months of low recruitment rates. Overall, similar effects were observed in patients on no supplemental 
oxygen or on low flow oxygen devices for casirivimab and imdevimab 2 400 mg, and casirivimab and 
imdevimab 8 000 mg doses, indicating an absence of a dose effect in this population. These dose 
groups were combined when compared to the placebo group for the efficacy analysis. 
At baseline, the median age was 62 years (with 44% of subjects aged 65 years or older), and 54% of 
the subjects were male, 43% of the subjects were seronegative, 48% were seropositive and 9% had an 
unknown serostatus. Baseline respiratory support received by subjects included 44% on no 
supplemental oxygen and 56% on low flow oxygen devices. Prior to randomisation, approximately 
33% of subjects received remdesivir and 50% received systemic corticosteroids as part of background 
usual care. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the 
casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups. 
The primary virologic efficacy endpoint was time weighted average (TWA) daily change from 
baseline in viral load (log10 copies/mL) through day 7, measured by RT-qPCR in NP swab samples, in 
subjects who were seronegative and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result at baseline. 
Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a statistically 
significant reduction in the LS mean viral load (log10 copies/mL) compared to placebo (-0.28 log10 
copies/mL/day for casirivimab and imdevimab; p=0.0172). 
The primary clinical endpoint was the proportion of subjects who died or went on mechanical 
ventilation in those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result.  
Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a reduced 
proportion of subjects with a high viral load who died or went on mechanical ventilation from day 6 to 
day 29, but the endpoint did not achieve statistical significance (relative risk reduction [RRR] 25.5% 
[95% CI: -16.2%, 52.2%]; p=0.2048).  
 13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a 47.1% RRR 
(95% CI: 10.2%, 68.8%) in the proportion of seronegative subjects who died or went on mechanical 
ventilation from day 6 to day 29. 
In a post hoc analysis of all randomized seronegative subjects aged ≥ 80 years, all-cause mortality 
from day 1 to day 29 was 18.1% (19/105 subjects) and 30.0% (18/60 subjects) in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab (combined doses) and placebo arms, respectively (risk ratio 0.60 [95% CI: 
0.34, 1.06]). 
Prevention of COVID-19 
COV-2069 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that compared 600 mg 
casirivimab and 600 mg imdevimab given subcutaneously to placebo for prevention of COVID-19 in 
asymptomatic household contacts of symptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (index 
cases). Subjects had not been previously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. 
Subjects were randomised 1:1 to casirivimab and imdevimab or placebo within 96 hours of collection 
of the first index case sample that gave a positive result (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2. 
Randomised subjects with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test result at baseline were assigned to 
Cohort A and those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test result were assigned to Cohort B. 
Cohort A 
The primary analysis population included subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR negative and 
seronegative at baseline. Subjects who were seropositive or who had undetermined/missing baseline 
serology were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis.   
For the primary analysis population at baseline, the median age was 44 years (with 9% of subjects 
ages 65 years or older) and 54% of the subjects were female. The baseline demographics and disease 
characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment 
groups. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who developed symptomatic RT-qPCR-
confirmed COVID-19 through Day 29. There was a statistically significant 81% risk reduction in the 
development of COVID-19 with casirivimab and imdevimab treatment versus placebo. In a sensitivity 
analysis that included all RT-qPCR negative subjects at baseline, regardless of baseline serological 
status, there was a statistically significant 82% risk reduction in development of COVID-19 with 
casirivimab and imdevimab treatment compared to placebo.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Both casirivimab and imdevimab exhibited linear and dose-proportional PK across the intravenous 
(150 to 4 000 mg of each monoclonal antibody) and subcutaneous (300 and 600 mg of each 
monoclonal antibody) dose ranges evaluated in clinical studies. 
Mean peak concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to 28 days (AUC0-28) and concentration 
at 28 days after dosing (C28) for casirivimab and imdevimab were comparable after either a single 
1 200 mg (600 mg of each monoclonal antibody) intravenous dose (182.7 mg/L, 1 754.9 mg.day/L, 
37.9 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 181.7 mg/L, 1 600.8 mg.day/L, 27.3 mg/L, respectively 
for imdevimab), or a single 1 200 mg (600 mg of each monoclonal antibody) subcutaneous dose 
(52.5 mg/L, 1 121.7 mg.day/L, 30.5 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 49.2 mg/L,  
1 016.9 mg.day/L, 25.9 mg/L, respectively for imdevimab). 
For the intravenous regimen of 8 000 mg (4 000 mg of each monoclonal antibody) in patients who 
require oxygen supplementation, the mean peak concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to 
28 days (AUC0-28) and concentration at 28 days after dosing (C28) for casirivimab and imdevimab were 
1 046 mg/L, 9280 mg.day/L, 165.2 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 1 132 mg/L, 
8789 mg.day/L, 136.2 mg/L, respectively for imdevimab, after a single intravenous dose. 
For the pre-exposure prophylaxis intravenous and subcutaneous regimens at monthly administration of 
300 mg each for casirivimab and imdevimab following an initial (loading) dose of 600 mg each for 
casirivimab and imdevimab, the median predicted casirivimab and imdevimab trough serum 
concentrations at steady state are similar to observed mean day 29 concentrations in serum for a single 
subcutaneous dose of casirivimab and imdevimab 1 200 mg (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of 
imdevimab). 
 15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption  
Casirivimab and imdevimab administered as a single intravenous dose results in peak serum 
concentrations at the end of infusion. The median (range) time to reach maximum serum concentration 
of casirivimab and imdevimab (Tmax) estimates following a single subcutaneous dose of 600 mg of 
each monoclonal antibody are 6.7 (range 3.4 - 13.6) days and 6.6 (range 3.4 - 13.6) days for 
casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively. After a single subcutaneous dose of 600 mg of each 
monoclonal antibody, casirivimab and imdevimab had an estimated bioavailability of 71.8% and 
71.7%, respectively. 
Distribution  
The total volume of distribution estimated via population pharmacokinetic analysis was 7.072 L and 
7.183 L for casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively. 
Biotransformation 
As human monoclonal IgG1 antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab are expected to be degraded into 
small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. 
Elimination  
The mean (5th, 95th percentile) serum elimination half-lives after a 600 mg dose of each monoclonal 
antibody were 29.8 (16.4, 43.1) days and 26.2 (16.9, 35.6) days, respectively, for casirivimab and 
imdevimab. The mean (5th, 95th percentile) clearances were 0.188 (0.11, 0.30) and 0.227 (0.15, 0.35), 
respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab. 
For patients who require supplemental oxygen, the mean (5th, 95th percentile) serum elimination half-
lives after a 4 000 mg dose of each monoclonal antibody were 21.9 (12.4, 36.9) days and 18.8 (11.7, 
29.4) days, respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab. The mean (5th, 95th percentile) clearances 
were 0.303 (0.156, 0.514) and 0.347 (0.188, 0.566), respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab. 
Paediatric population 
For adolescent patients with COVID-19 (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg in 
COV-2067) receiving a single 1200 mg IV dose, the mean ± SD concentration at the end of infusion 
and at 28 days after dosing was 172 ± 96.9 mg/L and 54.3 ± 17.7 mg/L for casirivimab and 183 ± 101 
mg/L and 45.3 ± 13.1 mg/L for imdevimab. 
For adolescents not infected with SARS-CoV-2 (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg 
in COV-2069) receiving a single 1200 mg SC dose, the mean ± SD concentration 28 days after dosing 
was 44.9 ± 14.7 mg/L for casirivimab and 36.5 ± 13.2 mg/L for imdevimab. 
The pharmacokinetics of casirivimab and imdevimab in children < 12 years of age has not yet been 
established. 
The pharmacokinetics of casirivimab and imdevimab in children < 18 years of age who require 
supplemental oxygen has not yet been established. 
Elderly 
In the population PK analysis, age (18 years to 96 years) was not identified as a significant covariate 
on PK of casirivimab and imdevimab. 
Renal impairment  
Casirivimab and imdevimab are not expected to undergo significant renal elimination due to their 
molecular weight (> 69 kDa).  
 16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment  
Casirivimab and imdevimab are not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted with 
casirivimab and imdevimab. Antibodies such as casirivimab and imdevimab are not expected to 
display genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. In tissue cross-reactivity studies with casirivimab and 
imdevimab using human and monkey adult tissues and human foetal tissues, no binding was detected. 
In a toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, non-adverse liver findings (minor transient increases in 
AST and ALT) were observed.

Ronapreve should be prepared using the appropriate number of syringes (see section 4.2, 
Table 3). Obtain 3 mL or 5 mL polypropylene syringes with luer connection and 21-gauge 
transfer needles. 
Using a sterile needle and syringe, withdraw the appropriate volume of casirivimab and 
imdevimab from each respective vial into each syringe (see section 4.2, Table 3) for a total of 4 
syringes for the 1 200 mg combined total dose and a total of 2 syringes for the 600 mg 
combined total dose. Store any remaining product as directed in Section 6.3.  
Replace the 21-gauge transfer needle with a 25-gauge or 27-gauge needle for subcutaneous 
injection. 
This product is preservative-free and therefore, the prepared syringes should be administered 
immediately. If immediate administration is not possible, store the prepared casirivimab and 
imdevimab syringes at 2 ºC to 8 ºC for no more than 72 hours and at room temperature up to 
25 ºC for no more than 24 hours. If refrigerated, allow the syringes to equilibrate to room

Posology  
Treatment  
The dosage in patients who do not require supplemental oxygen is 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg 
of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous injection (see Tables 1 
and 3). See sections 4.4 and 5.1. For these patients only, casirivimab with imdevimab should be given 
within 7 days of the onset of symptoms of COVID-19.  
The dosage in patients who require supplemental oxygen (including low flow and high flow oxygen 
devices, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)) is 4 000 mg of 
casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous infusion (see Table 2 of 
Ronapreve SmPC 120 mg/mL + 120 mg/mL). See section 5.1. 
Prevention 
Post-exposure prophylaxis 
The dosage in adult patients and in adolescent patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 
40 kg is 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous 
infusion or by subcutaneous injection (see Tables 1 and 3). 
Casirivimab with imdevimab should be given as soon as possible after contact with a case of COVID-
19. 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis 
The initial dose in adult patients and in adolescent patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 
40 kg is 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous 
infusion or by subcutaneous injection (see Tables 1 and 3). Subsequent doses of 300 mg of 
casirivimab and 300 mg of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous infusion or by 
subcutaneous injection may be given every 4 weeks until prophylaxis is no longer required. There are 
no data on repeat dosing beyond 24 weeks (6 doses). 
Missed dose  
In case of repeated dosing for pre-exposure prophylaxis, if a dose of Ronapreve is missed it should be 
administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, the schedule of administration should be adjusted to 
maintain the appropriate interval between doses.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants 
Decisions regarding the use of Ronapreve for treatment or prophylaxis should take into consideration 
what is known about the characteristics of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses including regional or 
geographical differences and available information on Ronapreve susceptibility patterns. See section 
5.1. 
When molecular testing or sequencing data is available, it should be considered when selecting 
antiviral therapy to rule out SARS-CoV-2 variants that are shown to have reduced susceptibility to 
Ronapreve. 
Subcutaneous administration for treatment of COVID-19 
The clinical efficacy of Ronapreve when administered by the subcutaneous route for treatment of 
COVID-19 has not been evaluated in clinical trials (see section 5.1). The pharmacokinetics of 
casirivimab and imdevimab in the first 48 hours after subcutaneous administration of 600 mg of each 
monoclonal antibody indicate lower serum exposures compared to intravenous administration of the 
same dose. It is unknown whether differences in initial systemic exposure result in differences in 
clinical efficacy. It is recommended that the subcutaneous route of administration is used only if 
intravenous administration is not feasible and would lead to a delay in treatment. 
 25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with administration of 
casirivimab and imdevimab (see section 4.8). If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant 
hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate 
appropriate medications and/or supportive care.  
Cases of convulsive syncope have been observed following intravenous and subcutaneous 
administration (see section 4.8). Convulsive syncope should be differentiated from seizures and 
managed as clinically indicated. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been observed with intravenous administration of casirivimab 
and imdevimab.  
IRRs observed in clinical studies were mostly moderate in severity and were typically observed during 
or within 24 hours of infusion. The frequently reported signs and symptoms for these reactions 
included nausea, chills, dizziness (or syncope), rash, urticaria, pruritus, tachypnoea and flushing. 
However, infusion-related reactions may present as severe or life-threatening events and may include 
other signs and symptoms. 
If an IRR occurs, the infusion may be interrupted, slowed or stopped. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. Casirivimab and imdevimab are 
monoclonal antibodies, which are not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes; 
therefore, interactions with concomitant medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are 
substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of casirivimab and imdevimab in pregnant 
women. Animal studies have not been performed with respect to reproductive toxicity. Human 
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placenta. It is unknown whether the 
potential transfer of casirivimab and imdevimab provides any treatment benefit or risk to the 
developing foetus. However, as casirivimab and imdevimab directly target the spike protein of SARS-
CoV-2 and in view of lack of cross reactivity with reproductive or foetal tissues in the tissue cross 
reactivity studies, negative effects on developing foetus are not expected. Ronapreve should be used 
during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the foetus 
considering all associated health factors. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking this medicine, the 
individual should be informed that any potential risk to the foetus is unknown. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether casirivimab and imdevimab are excreted in human milk, but maternal IgG is 
known to be transferred to milk during the first days after birth. As casirivimab and imdevimab 
directly target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and in view of low systemic absorption after oral 
ingestion of antibodies, administration of Ronapreve whilst breast-feeding can be considered when 
clinically indicated.

Fertility 
No fertility studies have been performed. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ronapreve has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Overall, 8 596 subjects (6 173 via intravenous administration and 2 423 via subcutaneous 
administration) have been treated with casirivimab and imdevimab in clinical trials. 
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions are hypersensitivity reactions, which include 
infusion related reactions (IRRs) and injection site reactions (ISRs).

Paediatric population 
Intravenous administration 
In the RECOVERY study, 4 adolescents ≥ 12 and < 18 years old received treatment with casirivimab 
and imdevimab. The safety profile observed in this limited population was similar to that in adult 
patients.  
Subcutaneous administration 
In study COV-2069, 66 adolescents ≥ 12 and < 18 years old received treatment with casirivimab and 
imdevimab. The safety profile observed was similar to that in adult patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 4 000 mg each of casirivimab and imdevimab have been administered in clinical trials. No 
data are available beyond this dose.  
There is no known specific antidote for casirivimab and imdevimab overdose. Treatment of overdose 
should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of 
the clinical status of the patient.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immune sera and immunoglobulins, antiviral monoclonal antibodies. 
ATC code: J06BD07  
Mechanism of action 
Casirivimab (IgG1κ) and imdevimab (IgG1λ) are two recombinant human monoclonal antibodies 
which are unmodified in the Fc regions. Casirivimab and imdevimab bind to non-overlapping epitopes 
of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. This prevents RBD binding to 
the human ACE2 receptor, so preventing virus entry into cells.  
In-vitro antiviral activity 
In a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation assay in Vero E6 cells, casirivimab, imdevimab, and 
casirivimab and imdevimab together neutralised SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) with EC50 
values of 37.4 pM (0.006 μg/mL), 42.1 pM (0.006 μg/mL), and 31.0 pM (0.005 μg/mL) respectively. 
Resistance 
There is a potential risk of treatment failure due to the development of viral variants that are resistant 
to casirivimab and imdevimab administered together.  
The neutralising activity of casirivimab, imdevimab and casirivimab and imdevimab together was 
assessed against S protein variants, including known Variants of Concern/Interest, variants identified 
in in vitro escape studies, and variants from publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genome data obtained 
 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Casirivimab and imdevimab 
neutralising activity against the Variants of Concern/Interest are shown in Table 5.

Clinical efficacy 
Treatment of COVID-19 
COV-2067 
COV-2067 was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating casirivimab 
and imdevimab for the treatment of subjects with COVID-19 (symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 
detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-qPCR]) who did not 
require supplemental oxygen and were at increased risk of progression to severe disease. 
In Phase 3 Cohort 1 of this trial, subjects not previously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 were 
randomised within 7 days of symptom onset to a single intravenous infusion of 600 mg of casirivimab 
and 600 mg of imdevimab (n = 1 347), 1 200 mg of casirivimab and 1 200 mg of imdevimab 
(n = 2 036) or placebo (n = 2 009).  
Subjects in Phase 3 Cohort 1 had at least one protocol-listed risk factor for developing severe COVID-
19 (these included age > 50 years, obesity defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, cardiovascular disease 
including hypertension, chronic lung disease including asthma, type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic 
kidney disease including those on dialysis, chronic liver disease, pregnancy and immunosuppressed). 
The median age was 50 years (with 13.1% of subjects aged 65 years or older) and 51.4% of the 
subjects were female. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the 
casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with ≥ 1 COVID-19-related hospitalisation or all-
cause death through Day 29.

(p<0.0001). 
RECOVERY 
RECOVERY is an ongoing multi-centre, randomised, controlled, open-label platform study, 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalised subjects with COVID-19. 
RECOVERY enrolled hospitalised subjects on no oxygen, low or high flow oxygen therapy, non-
invasive or invasive ventilation and ECMO. In this trial, 9 785 subjects in the United Kingdom (UK) 
were randomised to a single IV infusion of 4 000 mg of casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab plus 
usual care (n=4 839) or usual standard of care alone (n=4 946; herein after referred to as usual care 
alone). Subjects could receive between 0 and 4 treatments on top of usual standard of care. 
Subjects had clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and were enrolled 
regardless of the respiratory support required. Baseline serology test results were used to define 
analysis populations. 
At baseline, the mean age was 62 years (with 30% of subjects aged 70 years or older, 11 adolescents 
≥ 12 and < 18 years old were included) and 63% of the subjects were male. Baseline demographics 
and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab, and usual care 
alone, treatment groups. Subjects were enrolled in the study when the B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant was the 
dominant variant in the UK. Respiratory support received by subjects included 7% on no supplemental 
oxygen, 61% on simple oxygen, 26% on non-invasive ventilation, and 6% on invasive ventilation 
(including 17 subjects on ECMO). In subjects who were seronegative at baseline, 10% were on no 
supplemental oxygen at baseline, 66% were on simple oxygen, 21% were on non-invasive ventilation, 
and 2% were on invasive ventilation (including one subject on ECMO). Approximately 94% of all 
randomised subjects received corticosteroids as part of background standard care.  
The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality in all randomised subjects who were 
seronegative at baseline. The results are shown in Table 8.

In seropositive subjects, the 28-day all-cause mortality was 16% (410/2 636) in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab arm and 15% (384/2 636) in the usual care alone arm (rate ratio 1.09 [95% 
CI: 0.94, 1.25]).  
In seronegative subjects aged ≥ 80 years, 28-day all-cause mortality was 54.5% (126/231) and 57.5% 
(134/233) in the casirivimab+imdevimab and usual care alone arms, respectively (rate ratio 0.97 [95% 
CI: 0.76, 1.25]). 
Statistical testing of the secondary endpoint was performed outside of the hierarchy and is, therefore, 
considered descriptive. 
The secondary endpoint of discharge alive from hospital within 28 days was more common in the all-
randomised seronegative population treated with casirivimab and imdevimab compared with usual 
care alone (64% vs. 58%; rate ratio 1.19 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.31]), with a 4-day shorter median duration 
of hospital stay (13 days vs. 17 days).  
Among the all-randomised seronegative population not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, 
treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab was associated with a lower risk of progressing to the 
composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (31% vs. 37%, risk ratio 0.83, [95% 
CI: 0.75, 0.92]).  
COV-2066  
COV-2066 was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating casirivimab 
and imdevimab for the treatment of hospitalised subjects with COVID-19 on low flow oxygen devices 
(e.g., by face mask or nasal cannula) or no supplemental oxygen. In this phase 2/3 trial, 1 197 subjects 
had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result at baseline and were randomised 1:1:1 to a single 
intravenous infusion of 1 200 mg of casirivimab and 1 200 mg of imdevimab (n=406), 4 000 mg of 
casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab (n=398), or placebo (n=393), with all subjects receiving 
casirivimab and imdevimab, or placebo in addition to the usual standard of care for COVID-19. The 
overall sample size was smaller than anticipated due to the early study termination following several 
months of low recruitment rates. Overall, similar effects were observed in patients on no supplemental 
oxygen or on low flow oxygen devices for casirivimab and imdevimab 2 400 mg and casirivimab and 
imdevimab 8 000 mg doses, indicating an absence of a dose effect in this population. These dose 
groups were combined when compared to the placebo group for the efficacy analysis. 
At baseline, the median age was 62 years (with 44% of subjects aged 65 years or older), and 54% of 
the subjects were male, 43% of the subjects were seronegative, 48% were seropositive and 9% had an 
unknown serostatus. Baseline respiratory support received by subjects included 44% on no 
supplemental oxygen and 56% on low flow oxygen devices. Prior to randomisation, approximately 
33% of subjects received remdesivir and 50% received systemic corticosteroids as part of background 
usual care. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the 
casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups. 
The primary virologic efficacy endpoint was time weighted average (TWA) daily change from 
baseline in viral load (log10 copies/mL) through day 7, measured by RT-qPCR in NP swab samples, in 
subjects who were seronegative and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result at baseline. 
Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a statistically 
significant reduction in the LS mean viral load (log10 copies/mL) compared to placebo (-0.28 log10 
copies/mL/day for casirivimab and imdevimab; p=0.0172). 
The primary clinical endpoint was the proportion of subjects who died or went on mechanical 
ventilation in those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result.  
Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a reduced 
proportion of subjects with a high viral load who died or went on mechanical ventilation from day 6 to 
 32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
day 29, but the endpoint did not achieve statistical significance (relative risk reduction [RRR] 25.5% 
[95% CI: -16.2%, 52.2%]; p=0.2048).  
Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a 47.1% RRR 
(95% CI: 10.2%, 68.8%) in the proportion of seronegative subjects who died or went on mechanical 
ventilation from day 6 to day 29. 
In a post hoc analysis of all randomized seronegative subjects aged ≥ 80 years, all-cause mortality 
from day 1 to day 29 was 18.1% (19/105 subjects) and 30.0% (18/60 subjects) in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab (combined doses) and placebo arms, respectively (risk ratio 0.60 [95% CI: 
0.34, 1.06]). 
Prevention of COVID-19 
COV-2069 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that compared 600 mg 
casirivimab and 600 mg imdevimab given subcutaneously to placebo for prevention of COVID-19 in 
asymptomatic household contacts of symptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (index 
cases). Subjects had not been previously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. 
Subjects were randomised 1:1 to casirivimab and imdevimab or placebo within 96 hours of collection 
of the first index case sample that gave a positive result (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2. 
Randomised subjects with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test result at baseline were assigned to 
Cohort A and those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test result were assigned to Cohort B. 
Cohort A 
The primary analysis population included subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR negative and 
seronegative at baseline. Subjects who were seropositive or who had undetermined/missing baseline 
serology were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. 
For the primary analysis population at baseline, the median age was 44 years (with 9% of subjects 
ages 65 years or older) and 54% of the subjects were female. The baseline demographics and disease 
characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment 
groups. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who developed symptomatic RT-qPCR-
confirmed COVID-19 through Day 29. There was a statistically significant 81% risk reduction in the 
development of COVID-19 with casirivimab and imdevimab treatment versus placebo. In a sensitivity 
analysis that included all RT-qPCR negative subjects at baseline, regardless of baseline serological 
status, there was a statistically significant 82% risk reduction in development of COVID-19 with 
casirivimab and imdevimab treatment compared to placebo.

For the primary analysis population at baseline, the median age was 40 years (with 11% of subjects 
ages 65 years or older) and 55% of the subjects were female. The baseline demographics and disease 
characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment 
groups. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who developed RT-qPCR-confirmed 
COVID-19 through Day 29. There was a 31% risk reduction in the development of COVID-19 with 
casirivimab and imdevimab treatment vs. placebo. In a sensitivity analysis that included all RT-qPCR 
positive subjects at baseline, regardless of baseline serological status, there was a 35% risk reduction 
in RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 with casirivimab and imdevimab treatment compared to placebo.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Both casirivimab and imdevimab exhibited linear and dose-proportional PK across the intravenous 
(150 to 4 000 mg of each monoclonal antibody) and subcutaneous (300 and 600 mg of each 
monoclonal antibody) dose ranges evaluated in clinical studies. 
Mean peak concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to 28 days (AUC0-28) and concentration 
at 28 days after dosing (C28) for casirivimab and imdevimab were comparable after either a single 
1 200 mg (600 mg of each monoclonal antibody) intravenous dose (182.7 mg/L, 1 754.9 mg.day/L, 
37.9 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 181.7 mg/L, 1 600.8 mg.day/L, 27.3 mg/L, respectively 
for imdevimab), or a single 1 200 mg (600 mg of each monoclonal antibody) subcutaneous dose 
(52.5 mg/L, 1 121.7 mg.day/L, 30.5 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 49.2 mg/L,  
1 016.9 mg.day/L, 25.9 mg/L, respectively for imdevimab). 
For the intravenous regimen of 8 000 mg (4 000 mg of each monoclonal antibody) in patients who 
require oxygen supplementation, the mean peak concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to 
28 days (AUC0-28) and concentration at 28 days after dosing (C28) for casirivimab and imdevimab were 
1 046 mg/L, 9280 mg.day/L, 165.2 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 1 132 mg/L, 
8789 mg.day/L, 136.2 mg/L, respectively for imdevimab, after a single intravenous dose. 
For the pre-exposure prophylaxis intravenous and subcutaneous regimens at monthly administration of 
300 mg each for casirivimab and imdevimab following an initial (loading) dose of 600 mg each for 
casirivimab and imdevimab, the median predicted casirivimab and imdevimab trough serum 
concentrations at steady state are similar to observed mean day 29 concentrations in serum for a single 
subcutaneous dose of casirivimab and imdevimab 1 200 mg (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of 
imdevimab). 
 34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption  
Casirivimab and imdevimab administered as a single intravenous dose results in peak serum 
concentrations at the end of infusion. The median (range) time to reach maximum serum concentration 
of casirivimab and imdevimab (Tmax) estimates following a single subcutaneous dose of 600 mg of 
each monoclonal antibody are 6.7 (range 3.4 - 13.6) days and 6.6 (range 3.4 - 13.6) days for 
casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively. After a single subcutaneous dose of 600 mg of each 
monoclonal antibody, casirivimab and imdevimab had an estimated bioavailability of 71.8% and 
71.7%, respectively. 
Distribution  
The total volume of distribution estimated via population pharmacokinetic analysis was 7.072 L and 
7.183 L for casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively. 
Biotransformation 
As human monoclonal IgG1 antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab are expected to be degraded into 
small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. 
Elimination  
The mean (5th, 95th percentile) serum elimination half-lives after a 600 mg dose of each monoclonal 
antibody were 29.8 (16.4, 43.1) days and 26.2 (16.9, 35.6) days, respectively, for casirivimab and 
imdevimab. The mean (5th, 95th percentile) clearances were 0.188 (0.11, 0.30) and 0.227 (0.15, 0.35), 
respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab. 
For patients who require supplemental oxygen, the mean (5th, 95th percentile) serum elimination half-
lives after a 4 000 mg dose of each monoclonal antibody were 21.9 (12.4, 36.9) days and 18.8 (11.7, 
29.4) days, respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab. The mean (5th, 95th percentile) clearances 
were 0.303 (0.156, 0.514) and 0.347 (0.188, 0.566), respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab. 
Paediatric population 
For adolescent patients with COVID-19 (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg in 
COV-2067) receiving a single 1200 mg IV dose, the mean ± SD concentration at the end of infusion 
and at 28 days after dosing was 172 ± 96.9 mg/L and 54.3 ± 17.7 mg/L for casirivimab and  
183 ± 101 mg/L and 45.3 ± 13.1 mg/L for imdevimab. 
For adolescents not infected with SARS-CoV-2 (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg 
in COV-2069) receiving a single 1200 mg SC dose, the mean ± SD concentration 28 days after dosing 
was 44.9 ± 14.7 mg/L for casirivimab and 36.5 ± 13.2 mg/L for imdevimab. 
The pharmacokinetics of casirivimab and imdevimab in children < 12 years of age has not yet been 
established. 
The pharmacokinetics of casirivimab and imdevimab in children < 18 years of age who require 
supplemental oxygen has not yet been established. 
Elderly 
In the population PK analysis, age (18 years to 96 years) was not identified as a significant covariate 
on PK of casirivimab and imdevimab. 
Renal impairment  
Casirivimab and imdevimab are not expected to undergo significant renal elimination due to their 
molecular weight (> 69 kDa).  
 35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment  
Casirivimab and imdevimab are not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted with 
casirivimab and imdevimab. Antibodies such as casirivimab and imdevimab are not expected to 
display genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. In tissue cross-reactivity studies with casirivimab and 
imdevimab using human and monkey adult tissues and human foetal tissues, no binding was detected. 
In a toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, non-adverse liver findings (minor transient increases in 
AST and ALT) were observed.

- 
Inspect casirivimab and imdevimab vials visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior 
to administration. Should either be observed, the vial must be discarded and replaced with a new 
vial. 
- 
Obtain a prefilled intravenous infusion bag (made from polyvinyl chloride [PVC] or polyolefin 
[PO]) containing either 50 mL, 100 mL, 150 mL, or 250 mL of 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium 
chloride injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose injection.  
Using a sterile syringe and needle, withdraw the appropriate volume of casirivimab and 
imdevimab from each respective vial and inject into a prefilled infusion bag containing 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose injection (see section 
4.2, Table 1).  
Gently mix infusion bag by inversion. Do not shake.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ronapreve is and what it is used for 
What Ronapreve is 
Ronapreve is made up of the active substances ‘casirivimab’ and ‘imdevimab’. Casirivimab and 
imdevimab are a type of protein called ‘monoclonal antibodies’.  
What Ronapreve is used for 
Ronapreve is used to treat adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at least 40 kg with 
COVID-19 who do not require oxygen to treat COVID-19, and are at increased risk for the illness 
becoming severe based on the evaluation of your doctor. 
Ronapreve is used to treat COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at least 
40 kg who require oxygen to treat COVID-19, and who test negative for antibodies (proteins in the 
body’s defence system) against COVID-19. 
Ronapreve is used to prevent COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at 
least 40 kg. 
How Ronapreve works 
Ronapreve attaches to a protein on the surface of the coronavirus called the ‘spike protein’. This stops 
the virus from getting into your cells and from spreading between cells.   
 53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Ronapreve

● 
if you are allergic to casirivimab, imdevimab, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6).  
Talk to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible, if this applies to you. 
Warnings and precautions  
● 
This medicine can cause allergic reactions or reactions following the infusion or injection. The

these signs or symptoms. 
Children and adolescents

Other medicines and Ronapreve 
Before you have Ronapreve, tell the doctor or nurse who is giving it to you about any other medicines 
you are taking, or have recently taken.  
After you have had Ronapreve: 
● 
tell the doctor, nurse or pharmacist that you have had this medicine to treat or prevent COVID-
19 
tell the doctor, nurse or pharmacist you have had this medicine, if you are getting a COVID-19 
vaccine. 
● 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, or if you might be pregnant. 
● 
This is because there is not enough information to be sure that this medicine is safe for use in 
pregnancy.  
This medicine will only be given if the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the potential 
risks to the mother and the unborn child.  
● 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are breast-feeding.  
● 
This is because it is not yet known whether this medicine passes into human breast milk - or 
what the effects might be on the baby or milk production.  
Your doctor will help you decide whether to keep breast-feeding or to start treatment with this 
medicine.  
● 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive.  
3. 
How Ronapreve is given to you

older weighing at least 40 kg, who do not need oxygen therapy, is 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg 
of imdevimab.  
 54

initial dose, and the subsequent doses are 300 mg of casirivimab and 300 mg of imdevimab once every 
four weeks.  
How is this medicine given?

60 minutes. In patients who do not need oxygen therapy, this medicine may also be given as 
injections, given immediately one after the other, under the skin made at separate body sites if an

you are given the medicine. This is in case you have any side effects. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Administration by Intravenous Infusion 
Ronapreve infusion solution should be administered by a qualified healthcare professional using aseptic 
technique. 
● 
Gather the recommended materials for infusion: 
- 
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)-lined PVC, or polyurethane (PU) infusion 
set. 
In-line or add-on 0.2 μm to 5 μm polyethersulfone, polysulfone, or polyamide filter for 
intravenous administration 
- 
● 
● 
● 
● 
• 
• 
Attach the infusion set to the intravenous bag. 
Prime the infusion set. 
Administer the entire infusion solution in the bag via pump or gravity through an intravenous 
line containing a sterile, in-line or add-on 0.2 μm to 5 μm polyethersulfone, polysulfone, or 
polyamide filter for intravenous administration.  
The infusion should be administered over 20-60 minutes. The rate of infusion may be slowed, 
interrupted or discontinued if the patient develops any signs of infusion-associated events or 
other adverse reactions. 
The prepared infusion solution should not be administered simultaneously with any other 
medicinal product. The compatibility of casirivimab and imdevimab injection with intravenous 
solutions and medicinal products other than 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride injection or 
50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose injection is not known. 
After infusion is complete, flush the tubing with 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride injection or 
50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose injection to ensure delivery of the required dose. 
Preparation for Subcutaneous Injection  
Remove the casirivimab and imdevimab vial(s) from refrigerated storage and allow to equilibrate to 
room temperature for approximately 20 minutes before preparation. Do not expose to direct heat. Do 
not shake the vials. 
 61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inspect casirivimab and imdevimab vial(s) visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to 
administration. Should either be observed, the vial must be discarded and replaced with a new vial. 
The solution for each vial should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Ronapreve should be prepared using the appropriate number of syringes (see Table 3). Obtain 
3 mL or 5 mL polypropylene syringes with luer connection and 21-gauge transfer needles. 
Using a sterile syringe and needle, withdraw the appropriate volume of casirivimab and 
imdevimab from each respective vial into each syringe (see Table 3) for a total of 4 syringes for 
the 1 200 mg combined total dose and a total of 2 syringes for the 600 mg combined total dose. 
Store any remaining product as directed.  
Replace the 21-gauge transfer needle with a 25-gauge or 27-gauge needle for subcutaneous 
injection. 
This product is preservative-free and therefore, the prepared syringes should be administered 
immediately. If immediate administration is not possible, store the prepared casirivimab and 
imdevimab syringes at 2ºC to 8ºC for no more than 72 hours and at room temperature up to 
25ºC for no more than 24 hours. If refrigerated, allow the syringes to equilibrate to room 
temperature for approximately 10-15 minutes prior to administration.

consecutively at separate body sites (into upper thighs, upper outer arms, or abdomen, avoiding 
5 cm around the navel and the waistline).  
 62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Monitor and report side effects 
●  Monitor the patient for side effects during and after the infusion or injection according to 
current medical practice. The rate of infusion may be slowed or interrupted if the patient 
develops any signs of infusion-associated events or other adverse events. If signs or symptoms 
of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately 
discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care. 
Report side effects via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  
● 
Storage 
● 
● 
● 
● 
● 
Before use, store casirivimab and imdevimab vials in a fridge between 2 °C to 8 °C until they 
are required. Do not use after expiry date, marked on the vials/cartons after the letters EXP. 
Casirivimab and imdevimab concentrates are clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale 
yellow solutions.  
Before dilution, allow casirivimab and imdevimab vials to warm up to room temperature (up to 
25 °C).  
After initial puncture of the 6 mL vial, the medicinal product should be used immediately, 
and any remaining product should be discarded. 
Once diluted, Ronapreve should be administered immediately. If necessary, bags of diluted 
solution can be stored for up to 20 hours at room temperature (up to 25 °C) and 2 °C to 8 °C for 
no more than 72 hours. From a microbiological point of view, the prepared infusion solution 
should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior 
to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C 
to 8 °C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ronapreve is and what it is used for 
What Ronapreve is 
Ronapreve is made up of the active substances ‘casirivimab’ and ‘imdevimab’. Casirivimab and 
imdevimab are a type of protein called ‘monoclonal antibodies’.  
What Ronapreve is used for 
Ronapreve is used to treat adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at least 40 kg with 
COVID-19 who do not require oxygen to treat COVID-19, and are at increased risk for the illness 
becoming severe based on the evaluation of your doctor. 
Ronapreve is used to treat COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at least 
40 kg who require oxygen to treat COVID-19, and who test negative for antibodies (proteins in the 
body’s defence system) against COVID-19. 
Ronapreve is used to prevent COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at 
least 40 kg. 
How Ronapreve works 
Ronapreve attaches to a protein on the surface of the coronavirus called the ‘spike protein’. This stops 
the virus from getting into your cells and from spreading between cells.

Administration by Intravenous Infusion 
Ronapreve infusion solution should be administered by a qualified healthcare professional using aseptic 
technique. 
● 
Gather the recommended materials for infusion: 
- 
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)-lined PVC, or polyurethane (PU) infusion 
set. 
In-line or add-on 0.2 μm to 5 μm polyethersulfone, polysulfone, or polyamide filter for 
intravenous administration 
- 
● 
● 
● 
● 
• 
• 
Attach the infusion set to the intravenous bag. 
Prime the infusion set. 
Administer the entire infusion solution in the bag via pump or gravity through an intravenous 
line containing a sterile, in-line or add-on 0.2 μm to 5 μm polyethersulfone, polysulfone, or 
polyamide filter for intravenous administration.  
The infusion should be administered over 20-60 minutes. The rate of infusion may be slowed, 
interrupted or discontinued if the patient develops any signs of infusion-associated events or 
other adverse reactions. 
The prepared infusion solution should not be administered simultaneously with any other 
medicinal product. The compatibility of casirivimab and imdevimab injection with intravenous 
solutions and medicinal products other than 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride injection or 
50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose injection is not known. 
After infusion is complete, flush the tubing with 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride injection or 
50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose injection to ensure delivery of the required dose. 
Preparation for Subcutaneous Injection  
Remove the casirivimab and imdevimab vial(s) from refrigerated storage and allow to equilibrate to 
room temperature for approximately 20 minutes before preparation. Do not expose to direct heat. Do 
not shake the vials. 
Inspect casirivimab and imdevimab vial(s) visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to 
administration. Should either be observed, the vial must be discarded and replaced with a new vial. 
The solution for each vial should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow.

Ronapreve should be prepared using the appropriate number of syringes (see Table 3). Obtain 
3 mL or 5 mL polypropylene syringes with luer connection and 21-gauge transfer needles. 
Using a sterile syringe and needle, withdraw the appropriate volume of casirivimab and 
imdevimab from each respective vial into each syringe (see Table 3) for a total of 4 syringes for 
the 1 200 mg combined total dose and a total of 2 syringes for the 600 mg combined total dose. 
Store any remaining product as directed.  
Replace the 21-gauge transfer needle with a 25-gauge or 27-gauge needle for subcutaneous 
injection. 
This product is preservative-free and therefore, the prepared syringes should be administered 
immediately. If immediate administration is not possible, store the prepared casirivimab and 
imdevimab syringes at 2ºC to 8ºC for no more than 72 hours and at room temperature up to 
25ºC for no more than 24 hours. If refrigerated, allow the syringes to equilibrate to room 
temperature for approximately 10-15 minutes prior to administration.

Administration for Subcutaneous Injection  
● 
● 
● 
For the administration of Ronapreve 1 200 mg dose (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of 
imdevimab), gather 4 syringes (Table 3) and prepare for subcutaneous injections. 
For the administration of Ronapreve 600 mg dose (300 mg of casirivimab and 300 mg of 
imdevimab), gather 2 syringes (Table 3) and prepare for subcutaneous injections. 
Due to the volume, subcutaneous injections of casirivimab and imdevimab should be made 
consecutively at separate body sites (into upper thighs, upper outer arms, or abdomen, avoiding 
5 cm around the navel and the waistline).  
Monitor and report side effects 
●  Monitor the patient for side effects during and after the infusion or injection according to 
current medical practice. The rate of infusion may be slowed or interrupted if the patient 
develops any signs of infusion-associated events or other adverse events. If signs or symptoms 
of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately 
discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care. 
Report side effects via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

Storage 
● 
● 
● 
● 
● 
Before use, store casirivimab and imdevimab vials in a fridge between 2 °C to 8 °C until they 
are required. Do not use after expiry date, marked on the vials/cartons after the letters EXP. 
Casirivimab and imdevimab concentrates are clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale 
yellow solutions.  
Before dilution, allow casirivimab and imdevimab vials to warm up to room temperature (up to 
25 °C).  
After initial puncture of the 20 mL vial, if not used immediately, the medicinal product in the 
vial can be stored for 16 hours at room temperature up to 25 °C or for 48 hours in a refrigerator 
(2 °C to 8 °C). Other in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
Once diluted, Ronapreve should be administered immediately. If necessary, bags of diluted 
solution can be stored for up to 20 hours at room temperature (up to 25 °C) and 2 °C to 8 °C for 
no more than 72 hours. From a microbiological point of view, the prepared infusion solution 
should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior 
to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C 
to 8 °C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

1.  Introduction 
On 5-10-2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for ruxolitinib, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as a part of the paediatric clinical development program and is a clinical 
measure in the ruxolitinib paediatric investigational plan (PIP) which was approved on 1 Dec 2017 
(EMEA-000901-PIP03-16) and subsequently modified on 15 May 2019 (EMEA-000901-PIP03-16-M01) 
and on 9 April 2021 (EMEA-000901-PIP03-16-M02). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
This phase III randomized open-label multicentre study of ruxolitinib versus best available therapy in 
patients with corticosteroid-refractory acute graft vs. host disease after allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation (CINC424C2301) is a stand-alone study and is part of a paediatric clinical development 
program.  
With this submission related to Art 46, no changes to the paediatric information of the current Jakavi 
company Core Data Sheet or the current EU SmPC are proposed as a result of Study C2301. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Ruxolitinib tablets have been developed as immediate release uncoated tablets of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 
mg, 20 mg and 25 mg strengths for oral administration. The higher strengths are quantitatively and 
qualitatively proportional to the 5 mg tablet. 
In clinical studies with GvHD, only 5 mg tablets were used to allow for dose adjustments.  
Ruxolitinib 10 mg b.i.d. (2x 5 mg tablets b.i.d) was the dose used in study C2301 in adolescents and 
adults. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

Study design 
This randomized, Phase III, open-label study investigated the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib vs.  BAT  
added  to  the  patient’s immunosuppressive  regimen  in  adults  and  adolescents  (≥12 years old) 
with grade II-IV SR-aGvHD. 
The study schematic is presented in Figure 1-1. 
Figure 1-1 
Schematic study design 
Patients randomized to the BAT arm were allowed to crossover to the ruxolitinib arm if they did not 
demonstrate complete or partial response at Day 28 between Day 28 and Week 24 or if they lost their 
response and met criteria for progression, mixed response, or no response, necessitating new 
additional systemic immunosuppressive treatment for aGvHD. 
Study population /Sample size 
With a total of 308 patients planned to be enrolled with a 1:1 randomization (ruxolitinib vs. BAT) and 
stratified on aGvHD grade (Grade II vs. Grade III vs. Grade IV) the study would have 90% power to 
test for the primary endpoint (ORR at Day 28) and approximately 90% power to test for the key 
secondary endpoint (durable ORR at Day 56). 
A total of 310 patients with SR-aGvHD were enrolled, out of which 309 patients were included in the 
analysis (as one patient did not sign the study informed consent prior to receiving BAT (protocol 
deviation) and was excluded from all analyses), comprising 9 adolescent (2.9%) patients between 12 
to <18 years of age. 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: Patients eligible for inclusion in the study had to meet all of 
the following criteria:

Treatments 
The study treatment consisted of ruxolitinib or Investigator-choice BAT administered in an open label 
manner following randomization of the patient on study Day 1 in combination with corticosteroids ± 
calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). 
Ruxolitinib was administered orally twice per day at a dose of 10 mg bid, as two 5-mg tablets. 
Ruxolitinib was taken without regard to food. 
Best available therapy: Patients received BAT based on the investigator’s best judgment. The BAT in 
this study was identified by the investigator prior to patient randomization among the following 
treatments currently used in this setting: anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), extracorporeal photopheresis 
(ECP), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), low-dose methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate mofetil 
(MMF), mTOR inhibitors (everolimus or sirolimus), etanercept, or infliximab. No other types or 
combinations of BAT were permitted. BAT was sourced from the local market in each participating 
country. 
Other study treatments: Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and systemic corticosteroids could be taken by the 
patient as per standards of care. 
Other permitted concomitant therapies: Patients who undergo alloSCT are at risk for a variety of 
infections based on the degree of immunosuppression induced by the conditioning regimen prior to 
transplant.  Therefore, antibiotics, anti-infectives, and immunizations could be used as prophylactic 
therapies for infections. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: 
•  aGvHD assessment: Acute GvHD grading was performed by the investigator at every visit 
during the treatment period and at EOT visit. aGvHD was graded using standard staging 
criteria for aGvHD (Harris et al 2016): measures of body surface area aGvHD skin rash, stool 
volumes or frequency per 24 h time period, and serum bilirubin levels, staging by organ (skin; 
liver; upper gastro-intestinal; lower gastro-intestinal) and overall grading at the time of the 
evaluation. In addition, biopsy of the organ involved could be performed per institutional 
practices at Investigator’s discretion for aGvHD management. Once randomized, response to 
study treatment was assessed by the Investigator at every visit during the Treatment Period 
according to study protocol definition. 
•  Chronic GvHD assessment: Occurrence of definitive and possible manifestations of cGvHD 
was assessed monthly from Day 1 to Day 56 and at every visit thereafter during the treatment 
period, at the time of last dose if before Week 24, in responding patients, and at EOT (or 
Crossover EOT). After EOT (or Crossover EOT), patients were assessed for occurrence of 
cGvHD at the Safety Follow-up visit if applicable, and at Month 6, at Month 9, at Month 12, at 
Month 18 and at Month 24 during the Long-Term Follow-up period. Occurrence of cGvHD was 
not considered an adverse event (AE). cGvHD was graded as per NIH consensus guidelines for 
cGVHD, as mild, moderate, or severe at the time of cGvHD diagnosis. 
•  Graft failure monitoring: Patients were monitored for any evidence of secondary graft failure 
at each visit from Day 1 during the Treatment, at the time of last dose if before Week 24, in 
responding patients, at EOT (or Crossover EOT), Safety Follow-up if applicable, and Long-Term 
Follow-up periods. Occurrence of graft failure was reported as an event and also as an AE. 
Graft failure was defined as initial whole blood or marrow donor chimerism ≥5% declining to

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/74208/2022

<5% on subsequent measurements. Donor chimerism was closely monitored to detect graft 
failure. 
•  Chimerism: Donor chimerism after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant involves identifying 
the genetic profiles of the recipient and of the donor pre-transplant, and then evaluating the 
ratio of donor to recipient cells in the recipient's blood, or bone marrow. Chimerism testing 
using peripheral blood mononuclear cells or bone marrow (or peripheral blood selected CD3+ T 
cells) was performed during screening (prior to study treatment start), at Day 28 and at Day 
56. In addition, for patients who Crossover from BAT to ruxolitinib, chimerism was also 
performed at Crossover Week 1. Additional chimerism testing could be performed at any time 
during study (Treatment and Long-Term Follow-up period) at the treating Investigator's 
discretion according to local institutional practice as indicated. 
•  Hematologic disease relapse/progression assessment: Patients were monitored for any 
evidence of underlying hematologic disease relapse or progression during the study. Patients 
were assessed at each visit from Day 1 during the Treatment period, including during 
crossover period if applicable, at the time of last dose if before Week 24, in responding 
patients, at EOT (or Crossover EOT), Safety Follow-Up if applicable, and the Long-Term follow-
up period. 
The relapse and progression of the underlying hematologic disease were assessed by the 
Investigator as per the definitions outlined in protocol. 
Evaluation and/or evidence of malignancy relapse/progression was conducted according to 
local institutional practices. Per protocol, study treatment was discontinued underlying 
hematological disease progression or relapse. 
Patient-reported outcomes: In order to measure Quality-of-Life (QoL) among aGVHD patients, and 
potential changes over time, two patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments were administered: 
FACT-BMT (only adult patients) and EQ-5D-5L. 
Pharmacokinetics: Blood sampling for PK of ruxolitinib was performed in all patients enrolled in the 
study and treated with ruxolitinib to characterize the PK parameters in aGvHD patients. 
Extensive PK sampling schedule: “Extensive PK” sampling schedule was followed for approximately the 
first twenty-five (25) adult patients and all adolescent patients enrolled. The ‘Extensive PK’ sampling 
scheme includes a pre-dose and seven (7) post-dose samples on Day 1 and Day 7 thereafter, two (2) 
samples (1 pre-dose and 1 post-dose) per scheduled visit. 
Sparse PK sampling schedule: Adult patients randomized to ruxolitinib after the Extensive PK samples 
were collected, and any patients crossing over from BAT to ruxolitinib after Day 28, would follow the 
“Sparse PK” sampling schedule and had a total of two (2) samples (1 pre-dose and 1 post-dose) per 
scheduled visit. The plasma samples from all patients were assayed for ruxolitinib concentrations using 
validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. 
Safety: Safety was monitored by assessing physical examination, vital signs, height and weight, and 
laboratory assessments including urinalysis, assessment of pregnancy and fertility, clinical chemistry 
and hematology. Adverse event data was collected at every visit until the 30-day safety evaluation 
follow-up. Afterwards, only SAEs suspected with a causal relationship to study treatment as assessed 
by the Investigator were collected. 
Special safety assessments included: 
•  Bleeding, due to the potential complications of thrombocytopenia and/or coagulopathy in the 
setting of alloSCT.

• 
Infection monitoring identified as a risk associated with ruxolitinib and BAT for aGvHD therapy. 
•  Viral reactivation monitoring for hepatitis B and C (HBV viral DNA-PCR and HCV RNA-PCR), 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV viral DNA quantification), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV viral load), Human 
Herpes virus (HHV-6 viral load). 
•  Second primary malignancy monitoring defined as any new malignancy other than the 
underlying hematologic disease. 
• 
Pulmonary function test (PFT), if indicated clinically at investigator's discretion per local 
practices. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary endpoint ORR at Day 28 was evaluated in the primary analysis and secondary analyses 
(re-analyzed subgroup analyses); and was not repeated in this final analysis, except subgroup 
analyses were repeated and post-hoc sensitivity analyses were conducted.  
•  A post-hoc sensitivity analysis with exclusion of the subjects who had protocol deviations of 
organ staging and/or aGvHD response assessments performed per investigator judgement, not 
strictly following standard criteria defined in study protocol at Day 28 
•  A post-hoc sensitivity analysis with exclusion of the subjects with aGvHD grade <II at baseline 
The key secondary endpoint durable ORR at Day 56 was evaluated in the primary analysis and 
secondary analyses; and was not repeated in this final analysis, except a post-hoc sensitivity analysis 
was conducted with exclusion of the subjects who had protocol deviations of organ staging and/or 
aGvHD response assessments performed per investigator judgement, not strictly following standard 
criteria defined in study protocol at Day 56  
ORR at Crossover Day 28 was defined as the proportion of crossover patients with CR or PR at 
Crossover Day 28 according to standard criteria. ORR was summarized using descriptive statistics (N, 
%) along with two-sided exact binomial 95% CIs based on the Crossover analysis set (CAS) using local 
Investigators’ review of aGvHD assessment data. 
Durable ORR at Crossover Day 56 was defined as the proportion of all crossover patients who 
achieved a CR or PR at Crossover Day 28 and maintained a CR or PR at Crossover Day 56. Durable 
ORR at Crossover Day 56 was summarized using descriptive statistics (N, %) along with two-sided 
exact binomial 95% CIs based on the CAS using local investigators’ review of aGvHD assessment data. 
Analysis of secondary efficacy objectives 
The other secondary efficacy objectives were to evaluate the two treatment arms with respect to: 
•  Duration of response: DOR was defined for patients who had a CR or PR at Day 28. This was 
the interval between the date of first documented response of CR or PR (i.e., the start date of 
response), till the date of progression or addition of systemic therapies for aGvHD on or after 
Day 28. 
•  Overall survival: OS was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due 
to any cause. If a patient was not known to have died, then OS was censored at the latest date 
the patient was known to be alive (on or before the cut-off date). 
• 
Event free survival: EFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of 
hematologic disease relapse/progression, graft failure or death due to any cause. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/74208/2022  
Page 9/18 
 
 
 
• 
Failure free survival: FFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of 
hematologic disease relapse/progression, non-relapse mortality or addition of new systemic 
aGvHD treatment. 
•  Non-relapse mortality: NRM was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of 
death not preceded by hematologic disease relapse/progression. 
• 
• 
Incidence of malignancy relapse/progression: MR was defined as the time from date of 
randomization to hematologic malignancy relapse/progression. 
Incidence of cGvHD: Incidence of cGvHD was the time from date of randomization to onset of 
cGvHD. Deaths without prior onset of cGvHD and hematologic disease relapse/progression 
were competing risks. 
•  Cumulative steroid dosing until Day 56: Overall and weekly cumulative steroid dose for each 
patient up to Day 56 or discontinuation of randomized treatment was tabulated. In addition, 
the relative dose intensity (RDI), by week, was calculated relative to the starting dose of 
corticosteroids and categorized as (1) complete reduction where patients are tapered off 
corticosteroids by Day 56, (2) ≤50% RDI and (3) >50% RDI. Additionally, in the final analysis, 
the proportion of patients with any dose or 50% reduction of corticosteroids dose until Day 56 
from baseline have been also provided. Among those patients who reduced the dose of 
corticosteroids, the percentage change in dose from baseline to Day 56, and the maximum of 
dose reduction during the period were calculated using descriptive statistics. 
•  Cumulative steroid dosing until EOT: In the final analysis, the proportion of the complete 
reduction of corticosteroids by EOT (i.e., patients tapered off corticosteroids by EOT) have 
been provided. In addition, the proportion of patients with any dose or 50% reduction of 
corticosteroids dose until EOT from baseline have been provided. Among those patients who 
reduced the dose of corticosteroids, the percentage change in dose from baseline to EOT, and 
the maximum of dose reduction during the period were calculated using descriptive statistics. 
All the secondary efficacy endpoint analyses were non-comparative in nature and were analyzed using 
the FAS. 
Safety: All safety analyses were based on Safety Set, except that the summary of safety data during 
the crossover treatment phase were based on CAS. All listings and tables were presented by treatment 
group. 
Due to possible crossover from BAT to ruxolitinib arm after Day 28, imbalance in exposure between the 
two arms was expected. Therefore, safety summaries for the randomized treatment were produced for 
the following periods, unless specified: 
•  Up to Day 31 (the upper bound of the Day 28 visit window); 
•  Up to the earlier of i) cutoff date, ii) end date of on-randomized-treatment period.  
Safety summaries (tables, figures) included only data from the on-treatment period with the exception 
of baseline data which were also summarized where appropriate (e.g. change from baseline 
summaries). 
The data from on-randomized-treatment period and on-crossover-treatment period were summarized 
separately. In addition, a separate summary for death including on-treatment and post-treatment 
deaths was provided.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/74208/2022  
Page 10/18 
 
 
 
In order to account for differences in exposure of the ruxolitinib arm relative to the BAT arm due to 
crossover from BAT to ruxolitinib after Day 28 visit, incidence rates of adverse events were also 
presented by adjusting for duration of treatment period in patient-years where relevant. 
Laboratory data collected up to the end of the on-treatment period (randomized or crossover period) 
were summarized. Laboratory values were graded as per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Vital sign assessments were performed in order to characterize 
basic body function. 
In addition to the analysis of infections by standard CTCAE grading, the infection grading system 
developed by Cordonnier and validated for alloSCT patients predictive of mortality was also used in this 
study. Cumulative incidence curve for time to grade 3 severity infection as well as estimates at 1, 2 
and 6 months with 95% CIs were presented for each treatment group. In addition, the median time to 
occurrence of infection was calculated. Simple descriptive statistics, median, min and max as well as 
25th percentile and 75th percentile, were presented. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed/ Baseline data 
Demographic and background characteristics  
Baseline demographics were well-balanced between the two treatment arms. The median age in the 
overall population was 54 years (range: 12.0 to 73.0). The proportion of male and female patients was 
59.2% and 40.8%. Most patients were White (68.9%).  
The study population included 9 adolescent (2.9%) patients between 12 to <18 years of age, with a 
median age (range) of 15 years (range: 12.0 to 16.0) and majority of them being White (77.8%). 
Baseline disease characteristics  
Underlying disease history: Baseline disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment 
arms. Majority of enrolled patients had malignant underlying disease including leukaemia/ 
myelodysplastic syndrome (83.8% in ruxolitinib arm, and 78.1% in BAT arm). 
Transplant-related history: Most patients (75.4%) entered the study with low hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT)-comorbidity scores (between 0 and 2). There were minor differences in the type 
of conditioning regimen received prior to transplant between the treatment arms. In the ruxolitinib 
arm, 55.2% of patients received myeloablative conditioning prior to transplant compared to 41.9% in 
BAT arm. Consequently, fewer patients in ruxolitinib arm received the less intense forms of 
conditioning therapy (non-myeloablative: 20.1% and reduced intensity: 24.7%) compared to BAT arm 
(non-myeloablative: 26.5% and reduced intensity: 31.6%). T-cell depletion was performed in 39 
(12.6%) patients overall, including 17 patients (11.0%) in ruxolitinib arm and 22 (14.2%) patients in 
BAT arm. Peripheral blood was the most common source for SCT (87.0% in ruxolitinib arm and 76.8% 
in BAT arm), and most patients received grafts from identical human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched 
donors (59.0%; 183/310). The donor was related to the transplant recipient in 33.5% patients, in 
slightly fewer patients in ruxolitinib arm (31.6%) than in BAT arm (35.5%). 
Median total nucleated dose was similar between the two arms (ruxolitinib: 35.1 x 10E7 NC/kg, range: 
0.2 to 13020.0; BAT: 35.0 x 10E7 NC/kg, range: 0.2 - 7416.0). 
aGvHD disease history: Acute GvHD disease history was similar between the two treatment arms. The 
number of patients at baseline with grade II, III, and IV aGvHD in ruxolitinib and BAT arms were: 47 
(30.5%) vs. 54 (34.8%), 70 (45.5%) vs. 67 (43.2%) and 31 (20.1%) vs. 33 (21.3%), respectively.

Median time to conversion from grade II to IV aGvHD to SR-aGvHD was 10 days (range: 1.0 to 331.0). 
The most frequently used prior aGvHD therapy was steroid + CNI + Other systemic aGvHD treatment 
(47.4% in ruxolitinib arm and 43.9% in BAT arm), with most patients in the sub-category Steroid + 
CNI + only aGvHD prophylaxis (36.4% in ruxolitinib arm and 31.0% in BAT arm).  
Median time from diagnosis of SR-aGvHD to randomization was 1 day (range: 0.0 to 47.0). The most 
common reason for SR-aGvHD was failure to achieve a response after 7 days of treatment with 
steroids (46.8% in ruxolitinib arm and 41.3% in BAT arm). Among all patients, the most common 
organs involved at randomization were skin (overall 54.0%; 60.4% in ruxolitinib arm and 47.7% in 
BAT arm) and lower GI tract (overall 68.3%; 62.3% in ruxolitinib arm and 74.2% in BAT arm). More 
patients in the ruxolitinib arm had symptoms of skin (60.4%) and liver (24.0%), than BAT arm (skin: 
47.7% and liver: 16.1%). Upper GI and lower GI aGvHD involvement were less frequent in ruxolitinib 
arm (18.2% and 62.3%) than in BAT arm (23.9% and 74.2%). 
Efficacy results 
Overall, at the time of final analysis, the efficacy endpoint results remained in line with previous 
observations (Secondary and Primary analyses). Ruxolitinib showed sustained efficacy with longer 
follow-up. 
• 
The study met the primary endpoint and results were presented in the Primary analysis CSR 
and same results are presented again in this report. The ORR on Day 28 was 62.3% (95% CI: 
54.2, 70.0) in the ruxolitinib arm and 39.4% (95% CI: 31.6, 47.5) in the BAT arm. There was 
a statistically significant difference between the treatment arms (stratified Cochrane-Mantel-
Haenszel test p<0.0001, one-sided, odds ratio: 2.64 with 95% CI: 1.65, 4.22). 
•  Subgroup analysis based on additional data collected up to final database lock indicated 
consistent results with that of primary analysis for overall population. The OR was in favour of 
ruxolitinib across most of baseline characteristics subgroups, including aGvHD grade at 
randomization, organ involvement, donor match status, criteria for SR, prior aGvHD therapy 
and graft source, as well patients from various regions (Australia, Europe and Canada, and 
from Japan). 
• 
Post-hoc sensitivity analyses performed excluding subjects with protocol deviations of organ 
staging and/or aGvHD response assessments per investigator judgement at Day 28 (ORR of 
63.0% in ruxolitinib arm and 37.5% in BAT arm; odds ratio in favor of ruxolitinib: 2.87; 95% 
CI: 1.77, 4.65; p<0.0001) and excluding subjects with aGvHD grade <II at baseline (ORR of 
63.5% in ruxolitinib arm and 39.6% in BAT arm; odds ratio in favor of ruxolitinib: 2.75; 95% 
CI: 1.71, 4.41; p<0.0001) showed results similar to the primary analysis 
•  Durable ORR at Day 56 (key secondary endpoint) analyzed at the Primary analysis cut-off, 
showed statistically significant difference between two arms and in favor of ruxolitinib (39.6% 
in ruxolitinib arm and 21.9% in BAT arm; odds ratio: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.43, 3.94; p=0.0005). A 
post-hoc sensitivity analysis performed excluding subjects with protocol deviations of organ 
staging and/or aGvHD response assessments per investigator judgement at Day 56 showed 
results similar to the primary analysis, with durable ORR of 39.3% in ruxolitinib arm and 
20.9% in BAT arm; an odds ratio of 2.50 (95% CI: 1.48, 4.22; p=0.0004). 
•  Median duration of response was longer in ruxolitinib arm (167 days, range: 22.0 to 677) than 
in BAT arm (106 days, range: 10 to 526). 
• 
There was a 15% reduction in risk of death in ruxolitinib arm relative to BAT arm (HR: 0.85; 
95% CI: 0.63, 1.14), which was not statistically significant (log-rank p-value: 0.2800). OS

median follow-up time was longer in ruxolitinib arm (8.23 months) compared to BAT arm (3.81 
months). K-M estimated median OS was also longer in ruxolitinib arm (10.71 months) 
compared to BAT arm (5.82 months). 
There was a 15% reduction in risk of EFS event in ruxolitinib arm relative to BAT arm (HR: 
0.85; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.13), which was not statistically significant (log-rank p-value: 0.2723). 
K-M estimated median EFS was longer in ruxolitinib arm (8.28 months) compared to BAT arm 
(4.17 months). 
There were fewer FFS events in ruxolitinib arm (59.1%) than in BAT arm (78.1%). Median FFS 
with ruxolitinib was statistically significantly longer than with BAT (4.86 months vs. 1.02 
months; HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.66; p<0.0001). 
The cumulative incidence curves for NRM were overlapping for ruxolitinib and BAT arms, 
indicating similar event rates between the arms over time. 
• 
• 
• 
•  Sensitivity analyses based on longer follow-up for EFS and FFS including aGvHD progression as 
an event and for NRM including patients with underlying hematologic malignant disease, 
showed similar results as primary analysis. 
• 
There were few events of malignancy relapse/progression in both treatment arms (13.6% in 
ruxolitinib arm and 17.0% in BAT arm), suggesting that graft versus leukemia effect was 
maintained while treating GvHD patients. 
•  At Day 56, more patients in ruxolitinib arm (22.1%) had tapered off corticosteroids than in BAT 
arm (14.8%). Most patients in both treatment arms had any dose reduction (91.6% and 
87.1%) or at least 50% dose reduction (76% and 71.6%) of corticosteroids by Day 56. The 
dose reduction achieved at Day 56 was greater in patients in ruxolitinib arm than the BAT arm 
(-59.9% vs -52.4%; maximum reduction: -71.7% vs -64.6%). Similar trend was seen for 
complete tapering and reductions of steroid dosing until EOT. 
•  Up to the end of study, a total of 33.8% patients in ruxolitinib arm and 21.9% patients in BAT 
arm had developed cGvHD. Number of patients with competing risks were similar between the 
treatment arms. The median onset time of cGvHD was longer in ruxolitinib arm (217.5 days) 
than the BAT arm (185 days). Also, majority of cGvHD events were mild at time of onset in 
both treatment arms and there were fewer cases of severe cGvHD in ruxolitinib arm (6 
patients) than in BAT arm (8 patients). 
• 
In both the randomized treatment and crossover periods, there was an overall improvement in 
all aspects of EQ-5D-5L and FACT-BMT questionnaires in both arms, more pronounced in the 
ruxolitinib arm than in BAT arm. 
•  A small proportion of patients (10/309) experienced graft failure until the end of study, this 
included 5 patients each in ruxolitinib arm and BAT arm. 
• 
There were no remarkable differences in hospitalizations between the two treatment arms up 
to the end of treatment period. 
Pharmacokinetic results: 
• 
PK parameters for exposure after continuous dosing for 7 days were comparable to Day 1, and 
there was no indication of accumulation. After 7 days of continuous dosing, geometric mean 
Cmax was 129.3 ng/mL and AUCtau was 651.9 ng.h/mL in patients with aGvHD.

• 
PK parameters at Day 1 in adolescent patients could be computed for only 4 patients, however, 
within the ambit of the available data, the exposure in adolescent patients was within the 
range observed in adult patients.  
Safety results 
The overall safety profile at the end of study was consistent with that observed in the previous 
analyses (Primary analysis and Secondary analysis). 
The median duration of exposure to ruxolitinib was longer (63 days; range: 6 to 678) than to BAT (29 
days; range: 1 to 188). Overall exposure was longer in the ruxolitinib arm (40.6 vs. 18.9 PTY). The 
data presented in this section needs to be interpreted with caution given the significant difference in 
the duration of exposure between the two treatment groups and taking into account the sensitivity 
analyses adjusted for exposure. 
•  A similar proportion of patients in both treatment arms (ruxolitinib and BAT) experienced at 
least one AE up to Day 28 (96.7% and 94.7%) as well as during randomized treatment period 
(99.3% and 98.7%). In the Crossover period, the overall incidence of AEs (98%) was 
consistent with that of the ruxolitinib arm during randomized treatment period. 
• 
Infections and infestations, blood and lymphatic system disorders, investigations, 
gastrointestinal disorders and metabolism and nutrition disorders were SOCs with most 
common AEs up to both Day 28 and during randomized treatment period. 
•  During randomized treatment period, the difference in incidence of all AEs by SOC between 
treatment arms (ruxolitinib vs. BAT) was ≥10% only for infections and infestations (81.6 vs. 
71.3%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (72.4% vs. 50.7%), gastrointestinal disorders 
(63.8% vs. 50.0%) and investigations (58.6% vs. 46.0%), which were more frequent in 
ruxolitinib arm than in the BAT arm. 
• 
The most common AEs in both treatment arms were cytopenia and CMV infection reactivation 
•  Up to Day 28, the most frequent AEs were thrombocytopenia (32.9% vs. 18%), anaemia 
(30.3% vs. 27.3%), and CMV infection reactivation (22.4% vs. 16.7%). 
•  During randomized treatment period, the most frequent AEs were anaemia (40.1% vs. 
31.3%), thrombocytopenia (36.8% vs. 20%) and CMV infection reactivation (25% vs. 20.7%). 
•  Consistent with the observations up to Day 28, the incidence of AEs suspected to be related to 
study treatment during randomized treatment period was higher in the ruxolitinib arm 
compared to BAT arm, driven by higher frequency of AEs from SOCs of blood and lymphatic 
system disorders, investigations, infections and infestations and GI disorders in the ruxolitinib 
arm. Thrombocytopenia (23.0%), anaemia (17.1%), platelet count decreased (14.5%), 
neutropenia (13.8%), WBC count decreased (9.9%), neutrophil count decreased (8.6%), 
leukopenia (6.6%) and CMV infection reactivation (4.6%) were the most common PTs 
suspected to be related to study treatment in ruxolitinib. 
•  During randomized treatment period, the overall incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs was similar 
between the two treatment arms (91.4% in ruxolitinib arm and 87.3% in BAT arm). The 
incidence of these AEs by PT was also similar, except for anaemia (35.5% vs 24.7%) and 
thrombocytopenia (33.6% vs 16%) that occurred more frequently in the ruxolitinib arm than in 
BAT arm. 
•  When adjusted for exposure, the overall incidence of all grade AEs during randomized 
treatment period was higher in the ruxolitinib arm than in the BAT arm (5262.7 events/100

PTY vs. 4733.5 events/100 PTY). However, the overall incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs was higher in 
the BAT arm than in the ruxolitinib arm (1440.8 events/100 PTY vs. 1329.1 events/100 PTY). 
Exposure adjusted incidence rate of PT thrombocytopenia was higher in the ruxolitinib arm 
than in the BAT arm (152.6 vs. 118.7). 
• 
There was no definite trend in the probability of events from 0 to 6 months in either treatment 
arm. The probability of AEs was lower towards the end of the assessment period (i.e., beyond 
6 months). The probability of AEs was similar between both treatment arms over time. 
•  A total of 43 (28.3%) and 36 (24.0%) on-treatment deaths occurred in the ruxolitinib and BAT 
group, respectively. The most common cause of death was the study indication (including 
aGvHD and/or complications attributed to treatment for aGvHD) and related conditions in both 
ruxolitinib (21; 13.8%) and BAT arms (21; 14.0%). Other common causes of death were 
sepsis (3; 2.0%), cardiac arrest, disease progression, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 
and septic shock (2; 1.3% each) in ruxolitinib arm; and sepsis and septic shock (2; 1.3% 
each) in BAT arm. A total of 14 on-treatment deaths were suspected to be related to the study 
treatment, more in ruxolitinib arm (10 patients) than in BAT arm (4 patients). No new on-
treatment deaths occurred after the Primary analysis cut-off date. 
•  Up to Day 28, a similar proportion of patients in both ruxolitinib arm (37.5%) and BAT arm 
(34.0%) experienced an SAE. During randomized treatment period, SAEs were observed in 
66.4% patients in the ruxolitinib group and 53.3% patients in the BAT group. The SAE pattern 
remained consistent with the observations at Primary analysis and Secondary analysis cut-offs. 
•  When adjusted for exposure, the overall incidence of SAEs was higher in the BAT arm (424.3 
events/100 PTY) than in the ruxolitinib arm (307.0 events/100 PTY). 
•  SAEs with a fatal outcome occurred in similar proportion of patients in the ruxolitinib arm and 
BAT arm (21.7% vs. 21.3%). Sepsis (5.3% vs 2.7%) and septic shock (4.6% vs 2.7%) were 
the most common SAEs with a fatal outcome in both treatment arms. No new SAEs with fatal 
outcome were reported after the primary analysis cut-off date. 
•  By PT, the most frequent (≥5% patients in either treatment arm) SAEs were sepsis, septic 
shock, pyrexia, pneumonia, diarrhoea and CMV infection reactivation. 
• 
The incidence of SAEs suspected to be related to study treatment was higher in the ruxolitinib 
arm compared to BAT arm (27.6% vs. 12.7%), which was mainly driven by higher incidence of 
suspected SAEs in the SOCs infections and infestations (14.5% vs 7.3%) and blood and 
lymphatic system disorders (5.3% vs 0.7%). 
•  During randomized treatment period, AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation were 
observed in more patients in the ruxolitinib arm (27.6%) than in the BAT arm (9.3%). The 
most common (≥2% or >2 patients) AEs leading to discontinuation in the ruxolitinib arm were 
neutropenia, sepsis, anaemia, pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia. In the BAT arm, except 
thrombocytopenia (3 patients), respiratory failure and septic shock (2 patients each), all AEs 
leading to discontinuation were observed in one patient each 
•  During randomized treatment period, AEs leading to dose adjustment or interruption were 
higher in ruxolitinib arm (54.6%) than in BAT arm (12.7%), driven by cytopenia, including 
thrombocytopenia (13.8% vs. 0.7%), neutropenia (11.8% vs. 0.7%), platelet count decreased 
(11.2% vs. 2.7%) and leukopenia (5.3% vs. 0.7%). 
•  During randomized treatment period, AEs requiring additional therapy were observed in similar 
proportion of patients in ruxolitinib and BAT arms (97.4% and 94%). Most common (≥20%)

AEs requiring additional therapy in both treatment arms were anemia (32.2% vs. 26.7%) and 
CMV infection reactivation (24.3% vs. 20.7%). 
•  During randomized treatment period, the overall incidence of cytopenia was higher in 
ruxolitinib arm compared to BAT arm. Thrombocytopenia events were more frequently 
reported (56.6% in ruxolitinib and 36.0% in BAT arm). When adjusted for exposure, the 
incidence of thrombocytopenia events was 304.5 and 246.4 per 100 PTYs in ruxolitinib and BAT 
arms. Cytopenia is expected consequence due to mechanism of action of ruxolitinib. 
• 
The infection events were frequently reported in both treatment arms as expected in this study 
population; 82.2% in ruxolitinib arm and 71.3% in BAT arm during randomized treatment 
period. Corresponding exposure-adjusted IRs of infections excluding tuberculosis events were 
687.7 and 791.3 per 100 PTYs in ruxolitinib and BAT arms respectively. The most frequently 
occurring PTs in ruxolitinib and BAT arms were cytomegalovirus infection reactivation (25.0% 
vs. 20.7%), sepsis (11.2% vs. 12.7%), pneumonia (11.2% vs. 9.3%) and urinary tract 
infection (10.5% vs. 6.7%). 
•  During randomized treatment period, the proportion of patients with bleeding (hemorrhage) 
events was higher in ruxolitinib arm compared to the BAT arm (40.1% vs. 28.0%). When 
adjusted for exposure, the incidence of hemorrhage events was 153.0 and 174.3 per 100 PTYs 
in ruxolitinib and BAT arms. Hematuria was most frequently reported PT in both arm (7.9% in 
ruxolitinib arm and 4.7% in BAT arm). When adjusted for exposure, the incidence of PT 
hematuria was similar between the two treatment arms (24.6 vs. 24.4 events/100 PTY). 
•  Subgroup analyses of AEs during randomized treatment period:  
• 
• 
The observations from subgroup analysis by age, race and gender remained consistent 
with previous analyses (Primary analysis and Secondary analysis) and no major changes 
were observed. Overall, the profile of AEs was similar between the age groups and races. 
However, due to the disparity in number of patients across the age groups and races, it is 
difficult to conclude on any trends for AEs. 
The observations from subgroup analysis by region and by aGvHD organ involvement at 
baseline remained consistent with the Secondary analysis (not analyzed at Primary analysis 
cut-off). Overall, the AE profile remained similar between these subgroups. 
•  During randomized treatment period, abnormal hematological parameters were observed in 
patients from both treatment arms. 
•  Majority of the patients had low platelet count and low haemoglobin at baseline. The proportion 
of patients with post-baseline grade 4 low platelet count was higher in ruxolitinib than BAT arm 
(53.9% vs. 46.0%). Grade 3 worsening of low haemoglobin level from baseline was 
comparable between treatment arms (47.4% vs 46.0%). There were no patients with Grade 4 
low haemoglobin. 
•  WBC counts were within normal limits in majority of patients at baseline. Grade 3 (ruxolitinib: 
32.9% vs. BAT: 24.0%) or Grade 4 (ruxolitinib: 24.3% vs. BAT: 24.0%) worsening (decrease) 
of WBC counts from baseline were comparable between treatment arms. Grade 3 or 4 values 
for low neutrophil and low lymphocyte counts were comparable between treatment arms. 
•  During randomized treatment period, elevation of ALT, AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and 
GGT was noted in many patients. Of note, the liver is one target organ of underlying study 
indication.

In the majority of patients, the worsening post-baseline was to grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 abnormalities 
were comparable between the treatment arms and grade 4 abnormalities were less frequent in both 
treatment arms. A total of 7 (4.6%) patients in ruxolitinib arm and 12 (8%) patients in BAT arm met 
the criteria for Hy’s law. 
•  Notable vital sign values during randomized treatment period were comparable between 
ruxolitinib and BAT arms. 
Safety in adolescents 
9 adolescent patients (5 in ruxolitinib arm and 4 in BAT arm) were analysed for safety in the Study 
C2301. The median duration of exposure to ruxolitinib was longer (163 days; range: 11 to 242) than 
to BAT (58 days; range: 2 to 162). The exposure duration in the ruxolitinib arm was 1.7 patient years. 
Overall, the safety profile of ruxolitinib in adolescents was considered similar to that of respective 
overall populations. Some of the frequent AEs observed in the adolescent patients were related to 
Primary system organ class (SOC) of Blood and lymphatic system disorders (4 patients in the 
ruxolitinib arm and 2 patients in the BAT arm) and Infections and infestations (3 patients in the 
ruxolitinib arm and 3 patients in the BAT arm) and Gastrointestinal disorders (3 patients in the 
ruxolitinib arm and 2 patients in the BAT arm). Cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, and immune 
system disorders were not observed in patients between 12 to 18 years of age treated with ruxolitinib. 
The profile of suspected AEs and SAEs were similar to the adult patients. Given the limited number of 
patients in the adolescents group, results should be interpreted with caution. 
Up to the end of the study follow up period, 4 deaths were reported in adolescent patients. One death 
was observed in the BAT arm due to study indication and 3 deaths in patients randomized to the 
ruxolitinib arm (reason reported in one patient each: underlying malignancy progression, respiratory 
failure and infection). 
Fertility, pregnancy, birth and lactation 
There are no new human data on the effect of ruxolitinib on fertility. There were no reported 
pregnancies or lactation events reported during treatment with ruxolitinib for aGvHD.   
Safety conclusions 
The overall safety profile at the end of study was consistent with that observed in the previous 
analyses (Primary analysis and Secondary analysis). The safety of ruxolitinib in aGvHD is well 
characterized and is consistent with its established safety profile. The safety profile of ruxolitinib in 
adolescents is considered similar to that of respective overall population. 
In conclusion, ruxolitinib administered according to the recommended dose regimen of 10 mg b.i.d 
remains favorable for the treatment of GvHD patients 12 years of age and older who had inadequate 
response to corticosteroids or other systemic therapies. The overall safety profile is consistent with the 
previously known safety profile of ruxolitinib and as expected in the GvHD population and appears to 
be effectively manageable. No new or unexpected safety concerns were identified, of note no 
significant imbalance between ruxolitinib and BAT was observed in regard to the incidence of 
infections. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
A final report for the study CINC424C2301 in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006 was submitted. This Phase III randomized study was conducted to investigate the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib versus investigator-choice BAT added to the patient’s 
immunosuppression regimen in adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years old with Grade II-IV SR-aGvHD. 
A total of 309 patients were included in the Full Analysis Set, 154 were in the ruxolitinib arm and 155 
were in the BAT arm. The study population included 9 adolescent (2.9%) patients between 12 to <18 
years of age, 5 in the Ruxolitinib arm and 4 in the BAT arm. 
The study met the primary endpoint. The ORR on Day 28 was 62.3% (95% CI: 54.2, 70.0) in the 
ruxolitinib arm and 39.4% (95% CI: 31.6, 47.5) in the BAT arm. There was a statistically significant 
difference between the treatment arms (stratified Cochrane- Mantel-Haenszel test p<0.0001, one-
sided, odds ratio: 2.64 with 95% CI: 1.65, 4.22). The study also met the key secondary endpoint, with 
a statistically significant difference between two arms and in favor of ruxolitinib (39.6% in ruxolitinib 
arm and 21.9% in BAT arm; odds ratio: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.43, 3.94; p=0.0005). 
The results observed in the adolescent patients are similar to the overall study population.  
The overall safety profile of RUX-treated patients is consistent with its established safety profile and as 
expected in the study population. The safety profile of Jakavi is mainly characterised by cytopenias and 
infections. The safety profile of ruxolitinib in adolescents was similar to that of respective overall 
populations. No new safety concerns were identified in the present GvHD studies with ruxolitinib 
therapy. 
It should be noticed that this study has been also submitted and assessed with an application for 
extension of indication for Jakavi (II-53) to include treatment of patients with GvHD aged 12 years and 
older who have inadequate response to corticosteroids or other systemic therapies. The assessment of 
the variation II-53 is still ongoing and any impact on the Product Information for study CINC424C2301 
will be discussed in this parallel ongoing procedure. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Having considered data provided in the final clinical study report for the study CINC424C2301, the post 
authorisation measure is considered

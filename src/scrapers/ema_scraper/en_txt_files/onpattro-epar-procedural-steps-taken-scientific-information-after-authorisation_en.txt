the variation to terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)’ for 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Characteristics (SmPC), Labelling or Package Leaflet 
(PL) due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or 
pharmacovigilance data: update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 
5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC to confirm that the safety 
profile of pasitiran in liver transplant recipients is 
comparable to data in patients without liver 
transplant, based on final results from study ALN-
TTR02-008, a global phase 3b, open-label, extension 
study to evaluate safety, efficacy and 
pharmacokinetics of patisiran in patients with 
hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis 
(HATTR amyloidosis) with disease progression post-
orthotopic liver transplant (OLT). The RMP version 
1.1 has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to make some minor changes to 
the English PI in SmPC section 5.1, 6.3 (In line with 
EMA recommendation from procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004699/IB/0014), PL section 2 (minor 
typographical error changes), 6 (update to contact

Malta, and MAH local representative from ‘United

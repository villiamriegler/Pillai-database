2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Gardasil/Silgard is a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine. It 
is an aluminium adjuvanted recombinant protein particulate (virus-like particle [VLP]) vaccine for the 
prevention:  
• 
• 
pre-malignant lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal) and cervical cancer, causally 
related to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18; 
genital warts (condyloma acuminate causally related to HPV types 6 and 11).  
The current worksharing application was submitted to extend the indication to include pre-malignant 
anal lesions and anal cancer. 
Burden of anal cancer in men and women 
Approximately 27,000 new cases of anal cancer are estimated to occur annually around the world. In 
Europe, it is estimated that 6,800 new anal cancer cases occur each year, among which about 75-80% 
are attributable to HPV types 16 and 18. According to population-based studies, anal cancers are more 
frequent in women than in men, with over 60% of cases occurring in women. Among men, even 
though the incidence of anal cancer is higher among men who have sex with men (MSM), a substantial 
proportion of cases still occur in heterosexual men, at the population level. For example, a population 
based study estimated that 53% of anal cancers in males occurred in heterosexual men.  
In Europe, the annual age-standardized incidence rates of anal cancer are estimated to vary between 
0.1 and 1.4 per 100,000 in men and between 0.1 and 2.2 per 100,000 in women. This incidence has 
been continuously increasing over recent decades, both amongst men and women, in industrialized 
countries, in general, and in Europe, in particular. The reason for this increasing incidence is not well 
understood, but may, at least partially, reflect changes in sexual behaviour in the latter half of the 
twentieth century that increased the risk of exposure to HPV in the anal canal. 
The incidence of anal cancer is particularly high among MSM and immunosuppressed men and women. 
Risk factors for anal cancer are lifetime number of sexual partners, history of receptive anal 
intercourse, a history of genital warts or other HPV related cancers/pre-cancerous lesions, and 
cigarette smoking. Although identified as a risk factor, history of receptive anal intercourse has not 
been shown consistently to be a significant risk factor for high-risk anal HPV infection in women, 
suggesting that other sexual and non-sexual routes of transmission are possible, including 
contamination from cervix/vagina, non-penetrative sex or inoculation through fingers. The median age 
at diagnosis of anal cancer is approximately 60 years and five-year survival rates are ~60% for men 
and 73% for women. In addition to gender, survival from anal cancer has been associated with age, 
race, and stage of disease at diagnosis. 
The role of HPV in anal cancer 
Overall, published data suggest that approximately 90% of all anal cancers are caused by HPV. 
According to a meta-analysis, 84% of anal squamous cell cancers in men were HPV positive. Daling et 
al reported 87.9% HPV positivity of anal cancers in heterosexual men (HM), compared with 88.4% in 
women and 97.7% in men who were not exclusively heterosexual. In all populations, HPV 16 is 
consistently reported as the most common HPV type identified in anal cancers and AIN 2/3 lesions. 
HPV 16 was reported to be present in between 73% to 81% of anal cancers, followed by HPV 18 in 
about 3% to 5% of anal cancers. Daling reported that 73% and 7% of all anal cancers examined were 
positive for HPV 16 and 18 respectively, regardless of gender. Overall, the literature suggests that HPV 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014 
Page 4/42 
  
  
types 16 and 18 together account for approximately 75-80% of all anal squamous cancers, a larger 
proportion than for cervical cancers, strongly supporting the necessary role of these HPV types in anal 
cancer development. This is also supported by the results from a recent study on 496 anal cancer 
samples worldwide, in which HPV prevalence in anal cancers was reported to be about 90% (after 
adjustment for several parameters, including region of the world, period of diagnosis, age at diagnosis 
and gender). In this study, the contribution of the qHPV vaccine types to HPV-related anal cancer was 
estimated to be 87.2%, after taking multiple infections into account.  
Data provided in the current application 
In addition to the results from Protocol 020 that established the efficacy for prevention of pre-
cancerous anal lesions and anal cancer and the immunogenicity of qHPV vaccine (assessed in 
EMEA/H/C/703/WS/0029), the new results presented in this variation application are issued from the 
following studies: 
• 
For long-term protection and safety, new data issued from the long-term follow-up studies of 
the Gardasil clinical trials are available: 
a)  Protocol 020-21 (P020-21) – Long-term effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety study of 
Gardasil in young men: 6 years of follow-up [submitted through post-authorisation 
measures MEA 070 and MEA 069 respectively]; 
b)  Protocol 018-11 (P018-11) – Long-term immunogenicity, safety and effectiveness study of 
Gardasil among girls and boys who received Gardasil at 9-18 years of age: 8 years of 
follow-up [submitted in post-authorisation measure MEA 020.4]; 
c)  Protocol 015-21 (P015-21) – Long-term effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety study of 
Gardasil in young adult women: 8 years of effectiveness and safety, 9 years of 
immunogenicity [submitted through post-authorisation measure MEA019.3]; 
• 
in order to address questions on potential uncertainties on qHPV vaccine safety, including rare 
conditions, the results of the following post-marketing observational studies in women and 
men are available: 
three studies are part of the Risk Management Plan (RMP): 
1.  Protocol 031 (P031) – Post-licensure safety surveillance program in females: final report  : 
[submitted through follow-up measure FU2 028.3] 
2.  Protocol GDS03E – Final report on Analysis of Gardasil and autoimmune disorders using the 
Pharmacoepidemiologic General Research eXtension (PGRx) Information System.  
3.  Protocol 070 (P070) – Post-licensure safety surveillance program in males: First interim report. 
•  Other data source available: 
d)  Three independent studies (one in France, one in the US, and one in the Nordic countries) 
e)  The analysis of post-marketing spontaneous adverse event reports in males (in comparison 
with reports for females)  
f) 
In addition, in order to anticipate discussions about possible associations when vaccinating 
adolescent boys in Europe and to help interpreting post-licensure surveillance data, the 
background incidence rates of potential adverse events likely to be temporally associated 
with qHPV vaccination in adolescent boys were computed and compared to those observed 
in adolescent girls.

Finally, the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the benefit/risk balance of Gardasil vaccination 
for the prevention of premalignant anal lesions and anal cancer was performed by the MAH using 
complementary methods: 
a)  First, the MAH has estimated the absolute benefit of preventing anal cancer with Gardasil using 
the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) method and, in the perspective of a Benefit/Risk 
evaluation, has balanced it with estimations of the absolute risk of vaccinating the general 
population for this indication, using the number needed to harm (NNH) calculation  
b)  Then, the MAH has used the ‘problem, objectives, alternatives, consequences, trade-offs, 
uncertainty, risk attitude, linked decisions’ (PrOACT-URL) and the multi criteria decision 
analysis’ (MCDA) approaches, which are two similar and well-structured approaches to 
estimate the overall benefit-risk balance, both on a qualitative (PrOACT and MCDA) and a 
quantitative (MCDA) point of view. These two approaches allow taking into consideration all the 
potential benefits and all the potential risks within a single evaluation.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.4.  Clinical Efficacy  
2.4.1.  Main studies 
The pivotal study for this application is study protocol 020, which was fully assessed in the variation 
application EMEA/H/C/703/WS/0029. In addition, results from Protocol 020-21, 018-11 and 015-21 
were also provided. 
2.4.2.  Results 
2.4.2.1.  Protocol 020  
Protocol 020 (P020) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre safety, efficacy 
and immunogenicity study. The study included 4065 males of whom 3463 subjects (85%) were 
heterosexual males (HM) aged 16 to 23 years and 602 subjects (15%) were men who have sex with 
men (MSM) aged 16 to 26 years. All subjects were screened on Day 1 and randomized 1:1 to receive 
qHPV or placebo on Day 1, Month 2 and Month 6. Subjects were recruited at 71 study sites in 18 
different countries - Australia, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Croatia, Finland, Germany, Mexico, 
Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United 
States.

Page 6/42 
  
  
The primary objective of P020 was to determine whether administration of a 3-dose regimen of qHPV 
vaccine to men who were naïve to HPV 6, 11, 16 and/or HPV 18 at baseline would reduce their risk of 
external genital lesions (EGLs) (penile/perianal/perineal intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), 
penile/perianal/perineal cancer and genital warts) caused by vaccine-matched HPV types. In the MSM 
substudy, which was embedded within P020, the efficacy of 3 doses of qHPV vaccine against HPV 
6/11/16/18-related anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) and anal cancer was assessed in MSM who 
were naïve to these HPV types at baseline. 
P020 was designed to be unblinded for primary efficacy analysis when at least 32 cases of primary 
endpoints had accrued. The required number of cases was accrued and the study was unblinded on 
October 11, 2008. The median duration of follow-up as of cut-off date for the overall, HM, and MSM 
study populations were 34.3, 35.2, and 19.0 months respectively. 
P020 was completed, and the current variation includes end-of-study results from all visits through 
July 31, 2009 (database frozen October 21, 2009). Median durations of follow-up at study completion 
for the overall, heterosexual men (HM) and MSM study populations were 35.3, 35.4, and 32.2 months, 
respectively. The mean post-month 7 follow-up in HPV naïve subjects was 29.7 months (overall study 
population). 
Primary endpoint analysis: Efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL 
PPE Population 
Vaccine efficacy (VE) against HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL in the PPE population was 90.6% (Table 1). 
There were a total of 3 EGL cases in the vaccine group and 32 cases in the placebo group. All of the 
cases in the vaccine group and the majority of the cases in the placebo group had positive PCR results 
for HPV types 6 and/or 11 and were from diagnoses of condyloma. Of the 32 cases in the placebo 
group, 4 were due to diagnoses of PIN 1 or worse, with 2 cases of PIN 2/3 identified. No cases of 
cancer were detected during the study. 
The two vaccine subjects, who were cases of HPV 6-related EGL, had anti-HPV 6 titres at Month 7 that 
were comparable to the GMTs among per-protocol subjects who received the qHPV and were naïve to 
HPV type 6 during the vaccination period. The vaccine subject who was diagnosed with an EGL related 
to HPV types 6 and 11 had anti-HPV 6 and 11 titres at Month 7 that were considerably above the levels 
observed among per-protocol HPV-naïve recipients as well as those who had evidence of prior infection 
of types 6 or 11 at Day 1. Thus, these results do not suggest a failure of efficacy related to low 
antibody titres.

A cumulative incidence curve over time of vaccine type EGL by vaccination group showed that the 
incidence rate in the placebo group increased during the entire duration of follow-up, while the 
incidence rate in the vaccine group remained low indicating persisting vaccine-induced protection 
against HPV 6/11/16/18 EGL over the 36 months of the study. 
HNRT and FAS population 
Vaccine efficacy was 76.3% in the HNRT population and 66.7% in the FAS population. As expected, VE 
was lower for the EGL endpoint in the FAS and HNRT populations. The analyses of the HNRT and FAS 
populations generally support the primary PPE analysis of efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related.  
Efficacy results AIN substudy in MSM  
Subject disposition 
A total of 602 subjects were randomized into the substudy. The number of subjects who received at 
least one vaccination was 598. Overall, 91.1% of all subjects completed the vaccination phase. Overall 
432 subjects (78.3%) completed the follow-up phase.  
The mean duration of follow-up at the time of the analysis of the AIN Substudy endpoint was ~2.0 
years for the PPE population (post-Month 7) and approximately 2.4 years for the HNRT population 
(post-Day 1) in the substudy population. 
Efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related AIN and anal cancer 
MSM PPE Population 
The PPE population included a total of 402 subjects. Efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related AIN was 
77.5% (95% CI: 39.6, 93.3) (Table 2). There were a total of 5 AIN cases in the vaccine group and 24 
cases in the placebo group. All of the cases in the vaccine group and the majority of the cases in the

placebo group had positive PCR results for HPV types 6 and/or 16. Success was achieved in the test of 
the AIN sub-study efficacy hypothesis showing that VE against HPV 6/11/16/18-related AIN was above 
0% with a p-value <0.001.  
Of the 24 cases in the placebo group, 13 were identified with diagnoses of AIN 2 or worse. In the 
vaccine group, there were 3 cases identified with diagnoses of AIN 2 or worse out of the total of 5 
cases. The VE estimate for HPV 6/11/16/18-related AIN 2 or worse was 74.9% (95% CI: 8.8, 96.4), 
which indicates that VE for this endpoint is statistically significant with a lower bound above 0%. There 
were a total of 9 cases of HPV 16/18-related AIN 2 or worse. Of these, 1 case was in the vaccine group 
and 8 were in the placebo group. No cases of cancer were detected during the study.

MSM HNRT Population 
VE against HPV 6/11/16/18-related AIN and anal cancer for this population is 76.9% (95% CI: 51.4, 
90.1). The results are comparable to that observed in the MSM PPE population, even though any cases 
that occurred after the first vaccination were included in the HNRT analysis and the full benefit of the 
3-dose vaccination does not occur until after the third dose. 
The cumulative incidence curve over time of HPV 6/11/16/18-related AIN and anal cancer in HNRT 
showed that cases in the placebo group occurred evenly over the duration of follow-up. For the vaccine 
group, the time-to-event plot shows that all of the cases occurred in the first half of the follow-up 
period. Between the Month 18 and Month 24 visit, the cumulative incidence curve for vaccine 
recipients begins to plateau, while the curve in the placebo group continues to increase. 
MSM FAS population 
The FAS population included a total of 551 subjects. VE for this population was 50.3% (95% CI: 25.7, 
67.2). Efficacy was lower for the AIN endpoint in the MSM FAS than in the PPE and HNRT populations. 
Similar to the MSM PPE and MSM HNRT populations, the 95% CI for VE against HPV 6/11/16/18-
related AIN 2 or worse remains above 0%.

groups as the rate of incident disease related to prevalent infections in the vaccine group declines, 
providing further support for the effect of HPV vaccination in this non HPV-naïve population.  
2.4.2.2.  Protocol 020-21 
This is a long-term effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety study of Gardasil in young men with a 6 
years follow-up. Protocol 020-21 was added to the original base study to provide information on the 
long-term immunogenicity, safety, and effectiveness of the qHPV vaccine among these men up to 10 
years post-vaccination overall. Subjects who received at least 1 dose of the qHPV vaccine during either 
the base study (i.e. early vaccination group, EVG) or the first extension study (i.e. those who received 
placebo during the base study and the qHPV vaccine afterwards (i.e. catch-up vaccination group, CVG) 
were eligible to enter this long-term follow-up extension of the study. 
Results 
Subject Disposition 
A total of 4055 study subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and vaccinated with either qHPV vaccine 
(N=2025) or placebo (N=2030), in the context of the V501-020 base study. 
The V501-020-10 extension offered vaccination to all subjects worldwide who had received placebo or 
an incomplete series of vaccinations in the base study. A total of 1098 subjects who had originally 
received placebo (54%) received one or more doses of qHPV vaccine in this extension. In study 020-
21 the Early vaccination group consisted of 936 subjects, the Catch-up vaccination group of 867 
subjects.

Incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-Related External Genital Lesions 
In the PP population the incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18 - related external genital lesions coincides with 
the condyloma results presented above (Table 4).  
Incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-Related AIN 
There were 5 cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related AIN in the EVG MSM Per-Protocol population during 
the base study. In follow-up visits to date, no additional cases of this endpoint have occurred. 
Incidence of this endpoint remains low during the extension period. 
Incidence of HPV 31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59-Related External Genital Lesions 
Of the total 5 cases of HPV 31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59 - related external genital lesions, in the 
EVG HNRT population for this endpoint, all cases have been reported in the context of the base study. 
In follow-up visits to date, no additional cases of this endpoint have occurred. Incidence of this 
endpoint remains low during the extension period. 
Incidence of AIN Related to Any HPV Type 
Of the total 12 cases of HPV any - related AIN in the EVG GHN population no additional case has been 
reported subsequent to the base study. Incidence of this endpoint remains low during the extension 
period. 
Immunogenicity 
Persistence of Antibody Response in the Per-Protocol Immunogenicity Analysis Population 
Table 5 displays the geometric mean titre (GMT) levels of subjects in the PPI population, EVG, 
through Month 72 from first vaccination, as measured by the competitive Luminex assay (cLIA). 
Timepoints Day 1 through Month 36 were part of the base study. Titres observed at Month 48 
through Month 72 are comparable to those at Month 36, indicating no further diminution of titres in

extension period. 
The small group of subjects who commenced their long term follow-up in time for a Month 48 visit 
were all MSM subjects. As noted in the base study, MSM subjects demonstrated lower titres than HM 
subjects.  
Table 5 includes all subjects, both HM and MSM. Thus, the Month 48 GMTs are numerically lower than 
other time points. 
Table 5 also displays the proportion of subjects seropositive to HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 by time point, 
within EVG in the PPI population, through Month 72 from first vaccination, as measured by cLIA. Time 
points Day 1 through Month 36 were part of the base study. Titres observed at follow-up visits 
(Month 48, Month 60 and Month 72) are comparable to those at Month 36, indicating no further 
diminution of SPR in extension period. As noted in previous studies, and in the base study Protocol 
020, the proportion of subjects seropositive to HPV 18 by the cLIA declines over time. From Month 48 
through Month 72, the overall SPR is approximately 50%, whereas for HPV 6, 11 and 16, the SPR is 
maintained at approximately 85% or higher. Of note, no cases of HPV 18-related disease have been 
observed in the EVG PPE population, during the base study or follow-up to date.

2.4.2.3.  Protocol 018-11 (P018-11)  
Long-term immunogenicity, safety and effectiveness study of Gardasil among girls and boys who 
received Gardasil at 9-18 years of age: 8 years of follow-up.  
Background 
The V501 Protocol 018 was a Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the qHPV vaccine 
that enrolled 1794 boys and girls 9 to 15 years of age. Enrolment was stratified in order to achieve a 
ratio of 1:1 by gender and a ratio of 2:1 (9- to 12-year-old and 13- to 15-year-old, respectively) by 
age group across all centres. Once enrolled, subjects were randomized to receive either the qHPV 
vaccine or non-aluminium-containing placebo in a 2:1 ratio at each study site.  
The V501-018-11 study did not have a placebo group. The group vaccinated with the qHPV vaccine in 
the base study is referred to as the "Early Vaccination Group" (EVG). The group vaccinated with 
placebo in the base study were vaccinated with a 3-dose regimen of the qHPV vaccine starting at 
Month 30 (relative to study Day 1 of the base study) during the first extension of the base study 
(V501-018-05/06) and are referred to as the "Catch-up Vaccination Group" (CVG). Because there is

no placebo group, vaccine efficacy cannot be measured. In lieu of efficacy measurements, 
effectiveness of vaccination with the qHPV vaccine is assessed by calculating the incidence of 
endpoints in each of the EVG and CVG and comparing these rates with those observed in groups 
vaccinated in previous efficacy studies within the MAH qHPV vaccine program. This long-term follow-
up study started on Month 42 (relative to study Day 1 of the base study) and will be completed at 
Month 126 (approximately 7.5 years later).  
Results 
Subject disposition 
A total of 1,781 study subjects were randomized approximately 2:1 to receive the qHPV vaccine 
(N=1,184) or placebo (N=597) during the V501-018-00 base study. Among these, a total of 1,661 
(EVG = 1,179; CVG = 482) received at least 1 dose of the qHPV vaccine and were eligible to 
participate in the V501-018-11 long-term follow-up study. 
A total of 1,575 subjects (EVG = 1,116; CVG = 459) had follow-up post dose 3 of the qHPV vaccine. 
The median (mean) follow-up time post dose 3 of the qHPV vaccine was 6.8 (5.2) years in the EVG 
and 4.7 (3.5) years in the CVG. 
Immunogenicity Follow-up: A total 1,127 subjects (EVG = 798; CVG = 329) had at least one 
immunogenicity follow-up during the time period covering the Month 42 (i.e., the start of the LTFU 
study) through Month 96 study visits. 
Effectiveness Follow-up 
 For an individual subject, study procedures related to the qHPV vaccine effectiveness evaluation 
(i.e., detection of HPV DNA through PCR testing) commenced after that subject reached 16 years of 
age. Thus, follow-up time related to the effectiveness assessment differs from follow-up time post 
dose 3 of the qHPV vaccine. 
A total of 590 subjects (EVG = 388; CVG = 202), representing 36% (EVG = 33%; CVG = 42%) of 
the 1,661 subjects who received at least 1 dose of the qHPV vaccine had at least one follow-up visit 
with effectiveness data starting after Month 72 through Month 96. The median (mean) follow-up time 
related to the effectiveness assessment was 4.1 (3.8) years in the EVG and 3.9 (3.6) years in the 
CVG. Because study procedures related to effectiveness evaluations were performed only in the 
context of the V501-018-11 long term follow-up study, the follow-up time for effectiveness 
evaluations was similar in the EVG and the CVG even though the EVG has longer follow-up time post 
dose 3 of the qHPV vaccine compared to the CVG. Table 4-3 shows the number of subjects with 
effectiveness follow-up during the time period covering the Month 42 through Month 96 study visits 
for each of the EVG and CVG, separately for males and females. 
Incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related Persistent Infection and Disease among Females 
Table 5 shows the estimates of incidence rate (per 100 person-years) of the co-primary endpoint of 
HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection and disease among females in the EVG and CVG in the 
Per-Protocol Effectiveness (PPE) population.  
No cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN (any grade) were observed in either the EVG or CVG; no 
cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL were observed in either the EVG or CVG; while two cases of 
HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection, both related to HPV 16, were observed in the EVG and 
one case of HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection, related to HPV 16, was observed in the CVG. 
The 2 cases of HPV 16-related persistent infection observed in the EVG over 645.3 person-years of 
follow-up represent an incidence of 0.3 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.0 to 1.1) while the single

case of the same type persistent infection observed in the CVG over 212.7 person-years of follow-up 
has an incidence of 0.5 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.0 to 2.6). Such incidences observed in 
Protocol 018 are comparable to the corresponding incidences observed in the qHPV vaccine group in 
the per-protocol populations of other V501 efficacy studies among females. There are five more 
endpoint cases of persistent infection identified in CVG group in the FAS population, one related to 
HPV 16 and four related to HPV 18. One case of CIN 1 is also observed in the CVG group in FAS 
population.

Incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related Persistent Infection and Disease among Males 
• 
• 
• 
No cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL were observed in either the EVG or CVG; 
2 cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection, one related to HPV 6, the 
other related to HPV16, were observed in the EVG; 
1 case of HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection, related to HPV 6, was observed 
in the CVG. 
The 2 cases of persistent infection observed in the EVG over 459.8 person-years of follow-up 
represent an incidence of 0.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.1 to 1.6) while the single case of 
persistent infection observed in the CVG over 161 person-years of follow-up represents an incidence 
of 0.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.0 to 3.5). Such incidences observed in Protocol 018 are 
comparable to the corresponding incidences observed in the qHPV vaccine group in the per-protocol 
populations of other V501 efficacy studies among males. 
There are no endpoints identified in the FAS analysis additional to the endpoint cases of persistent 
infection among males already identified in the PPE analysis. 
Immunogenicity 
Anti-HPV as measured by both the cLIA and the IgG LIA were consistent with the observed efficacy of 
the qHPV vaccine that provides continued protection against HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent 
infection or disease for up to at least eight years following vaccination in adolescents. 
The percentage of subjects who were seropositive at Month 96 visit was high for all HPV types. For 
HPV 18, 88.8% of EVG subjects were seropositive as measured by the IgG LIA compared with 64.1% 
as measured by the cLIA assay. Despite the lower seropositivity for HPV type 18 over time, when 
measured with the cLIA, there were no cases of either HPV type 18-related persistent infection or 
disease.  
2.4.2.4.  Protocol 015-21 (P015-21)  
Long-term effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety study of Gardasil in young adult women: 8 
years of effectiveness and safety, 9 years of immunogenicity.  
Background 
Protocol V501-015 was a pivotal Phase III, efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety study that supported 
the initial licensure of the qHPV vaccine. The study included 5493 women in Denmark, Iceland, 
Norway, and Sweden, randomized in a 1:1 ratio and received either qHPV vaccine or placebo in 2002 
to 2003. Participation and retention in these countries was very high with approximately 95% of 
study participants in both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 completing the Month 48 visit. Subject-level data 
are being collected from: 
Cohort 1: Approximately 2700 subjects who received qHPV vaccine at the start of Protocol V501-015 
and will contribute approximately 14-years of follow-up after vaccination (4-years within Protocol 
V501-015 and 10-years within the LTFU study). 
Cohort 2: Approximately 2100 subjects who received placebo at the start of Protocol V501-015 and 
qHPV vaccine prior to entry into the LTFU. These subjects will contribute 10 years of follow-up after 
vaccination of qHPV vaccine 
The LTFU of Protocol V501-015 subjects will be accomplished in 2 ways: 1) registry based follow-up 
for effectiveness data as well as safety data including but not limited to deaths, cancers, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/240314/2014 
Page 17/42 
 
  
  
hospitalizations; 2) active follow-up for blood collection for immunogenicity assessments at Years 5 
and 10 of the LTFU study. 
Effectiveness and safety analyses will occur approximately 2 years following completion of Protocol 
V501-015 and approximately every 2 years thereafter for 10 years. A 10 year registry follow-up (14 
years total) means that 16- to 23-year-old women (Nordic Region enrolment age) will be followed 
until they are 30 to 37 years old. This period covers the period of peak incidence of CIN 2/3 and AIS, 
and the onset of the period of highest risk for cervical cancer. Immunogenicity analyses will occur 
after the Year 5 and Year 10 study visits are completed.  
The V501-015-21 Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) Study report was based on available data collected 
from national healthcare registries in Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The data covered the 
period from 02 March 2009 through 01 March 2011; which represents approximately 4 to 8 years of 
post-vaccination follow-up. The final clinical study report is estimated to be in 2019. 
Results 
Subject disposition 
A total of 5493 subjects in Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden were vaccinated with either qHPV 
vaccine or placebo in the Protocol V501-015 base study. Of these, 4847 received at least one dose of 
qHPV vaccine, either during the vaccination phase of the study or during the extension for vaccination 
of subjects who initially received placebo, and were eligible to participate in the Nordic LTFU 
extension study (Protocol V501-015-21). 
Primary Effectiveness Objective: Analysis of Effectiveness in the Per-Protocol Efficacy (PPE) 
Population 
There were zero (0) cases of HPV 16/18-related CIN 2 or worse observed in Cohort 1. There were 
1724 subjects out of 2650 eligible subjects in the PPE population who contributed a total of 5144.1 
person-years of follow-up since their exit from the base study. 
The estimated baseline incidence rate of HPV 16/18-related CIN 2 or worse in this vaccinated cohort 
is 0.287/1,000 person-years if vaccine efficacy is maintained at 90%. Based on the 5144.1 person-
years of follow-up time accrued, 1 case is expected if vaccine efficacy is maintained at 90%. As of 01 
March 2011, no cases were observed. 
Based on the number of eligible subjects in this population, a minimum of 2634 person years of 
follow-up time are necessary in any given interval of time since Day 1 in order to draw conclusions 
from the results of this analysis. A total of 3077.2 person-years have been accrued over the period 
from 4 to 6 years following vaccination in the Cohort 1 per-protocol population, which is a sufficient 
amount of follow-up time to conclude that effectiveness has been maintained beyond the initial 4 
years follow-up period of the base study up to 6 years. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Discussion and conclusion on the AIN endpoint  
The evidence supporting that the qHPV vaccine is efficacious against AIN 2/3 in the MSM population 
included the consistent efficacy against all grades of anal disease severity and in all populations 
including the FAS, the high level of efficacy against intra-anal persistent infection related to HPV 16 
and HPV18 and, considering the close parallels between anal and cervical disease/cancer, the efficacy 
data on CIN 2/3 in women. The extrapolation of data from MSM to healthy heterosexual men and 
women are considered justified by the supportive data provided from the literature and the fact that 
the anatomic location, the histologic and molecular characteristics of AIN/cancer are identical between 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014 
Page 18/42 
  
  
the genders, supporting the same role of HPV in the pathogenesis of cancer development. Moreover, 
based on clinical trial data on qHPV vaccine, there is no evidence that efficacy of the vaccine is gender 
specific and the estimates obtained in MSM would be applicable to women and HM. 
The issue whether or not AIN 2/3 lesions can be considered a surrogate marker for anal cancer is 
resolved on the basis of the literature data available, albeit limited, and also based on the striking 
similarities between CIN and AIN as regards natural history, pathogenesis, histological appearance, 
spectrum of lesions and high-risk HPV types, which overall provide strong evidence that AIN 2/3 
lesions are a precursor of invasive HPV-related cancer and could be considered as a surrogate marker 
of invasive cancer, in the same way as CIN 2/3 lesions are a surrogate marker for cervical cancer. 
In conclusion, the extrapolation of the relative efficacy in preventing AIN 2/3 from the MSM to the 
general population is considered acceptable, but, because of the low incidence of anal cancer in the 
general population, the absolute benefit is considered small.  
2.4.4.  Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy against premalignant anal lesions is considered demonstrated, and can be extrapolated to anal 
cancer. The data can also be extrapolated to a general population. However, the absolute benefit of 
protection against anal cancer in the general population is considered small due to the low incidence of 
anal cancer in the general population.   
2.5.  Clinical Safety aspects  
2.5.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
In addition to the results from Protocol 020 that established the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of 
the qHPV vaccine for the prevention of pre-cancerous anal lesions and anal cancer, new safety data 
from the following long-term follow-up studies of qHPV clinical trials are now available: 
a)  Protocol 020-21 (P020-21) – Long-term effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety study of 
GARDASIL in young men; 
b)  Protocol 018-11 (P018-11) – Long-term immunogenicity, safety and effectiveness study of 
GARDASIL among girls and boys who received GARDASIL at 9-18 years of age;  
c)  Protocol 015-20 (P015-21) – Long-term effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety study of 
GARDASIL in young adult women. 
These three long-term follow-up safety studies have collected data for 7,714 subjects (Table 7).

with reports for females) was provided. 
Patient exposure 
Safety data for qHPV vaccination in men: Protocol 020 
In protocol 020, men aged 16 to 26 years were randomized to receive three doses of qHPV vaccine or 
three doses of placebo. A total of 4055 study subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and vaccinated 
with either qHPV vaccine (N=2025) or placebo (N=2030). Data for tolerability and safety were 
collected on a Vaccination Report Card (VRC) for 14 days following each vaccination. Serious adverse 
events occurring after this reporting period were collected if the event resulted in death or was judged 
by the investigator to be vaccine- or study related. The medical histories of all subjects were collected 
on Day 1. At subsequent visits, new medical history that had occurred since the previous study visit 
was recorded. 
Long-term follow-up safety data in men: Protocol 020-21 
A long-term follow-up extension, protocol 020-21 was added to the original base study to provide 
information on the long-term immunogenicity, safety, and effectiveness of the qHPV vaccine among 
these men up to 10 years post-vaccination. Subjects who received at least one dose of the qHPV 
vaccine during either the base study (i.e., early vaccination group, EVG) or the first extension study 
(i.e., those who received placebo during the base study and the qHPV vaccine afterwards (i.e. catch-up 
vaccination group, CVG) were eligible to enter this long-term follow-up extension of the study. 
The first interim report was submitted in June 2013. Out of the 2,966 subjects who completed the 
Protocol 020 base study, 1,805 subjects participated in the long-term study as of the data cut-off date 
of the first interim report (01 June 2012). Among these subjects, the median follow-up time Post-Dose 
3 was 5.8 years in the EVG. The range of follow-up was 3.1 to 6.8 years. 
The Protocol 020-21 study safety objective is to describe the incidence of vaccine- or procedure-
related serious adverse events (SAEs), SAEs resulting in death and pre-specified medical conditions. 
The assessment related to the study’s safety objective was conducted on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), 
which included all subjects who received at least one dose of the qHPV vaccine. 
Long-term safety data of qHPV vaccine in girls and boys: Protocol 018- 11 
A total of 1,781 study subjects were randomized approximately 2:1 to receive the qHPV vaccine 
(N=1,184) or placebo (N=597) during the V501-018-00 base study. Among these, 1,661 (EVG = 
1,179; CVG = 482) received at least one dose of qHPV vaccine and were eligible to participate in the 
Assessment report

V501-018-11 long-term follow-up study. The median age at time of injection of dose 1 of the qHPV 
vaccine was 12 years in the EVG and 15 years in the CVG. The V501-018-11 study safety objective 
was to describe the incidence of deaths and serious adverse experiences deemed by the study 
investigators to be vaccine- or procedure-related. The assessment related to the study’s safety 
objective was conducted on the Full Analysis Set, which included all subjects who received at least one 
dose of the qHPV vaccine. The Month 96 interim analysis database was based on follow-up data from 
1,575 subjects, accumulated up to the data cut-off date of 18th May 2012. 
Long-term safety data of qHPV vaccine in women: Protocol 015-21 
In the Protocol V501-015 base study, 5493 subjects in Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden were 
vaccinated with either qHPV vaccine or placebo. Of these, 4847 received at least one dose of qHPV 
vaccine, either during the vaccination phase of the study (Cohort 1) or during the extension for 
vaccination of subjects who initially received placebo (Cohort 2), and were eligible to participate in the 
Nordic LTFU extension study (Protocol V501-015-21). Most of the eligible subjects had consented to 
the passive follow-up portions of the LTFU study (Total n= 4,336; Cohort 1=2,448; Cohort 2=1,888) 
as part of the original protocol and additional country-specific consent was obtained for collection of 
long-term safety data. The Nordic Cancer Registries were searched for deaths, cancers, 
hospitalizations and other safety outcomes (including, but not limited to, incident cases of: systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), acute disseminated 
encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and multiple sclerosis (MS)) as measures of long-term safety in the 
vaccinated group. Data are available for new medical history conditions to measure long-term safety in 
subjects vaccinated with the qHPV vaccine in Cohorts 1 and 2 up to the data cut-off date of 1st March 
2011; this represents about four to eight years of post-vaccination follow-up. 
US: post-licensure safety surveillance study in females: Protocol 031-02 
This study is a post-licensure regulatory commitment to the FDA and the EMA; it is part of the Gardasil 
RMP. The study was sponsored by Merck and conducted by two large managed care organizations, 
Kaiser Permanente North California (KPNC) and Kaiser Permanente South California (KPSC) using their 
electronic health records. A total of about 190,000 females who received at least 1 dose of qHPV 
vaccine (‘Secondary Study Population’) were enroled in the study, including about 44,000 females 
aged 9 to 26 years who received three doses of qHPV vaccine per protocol (‘Primary Study 
Population’). Safety was measured by assessing: 
a)  general safety (emergency room visits and hospitalization) on day 0 (day of vaccination), 
and from day 1 to 60) 
b)  Pregnancy safety  
c)  Occurrence of 16 pre-specified autoimmune (AI) conditions within six months of qHPV 
vaccination. 
France: post-licensure safety surveillance study for pre-specified autoimmune diseases in 
females: Protocol GDS03E 
Protocol GDS03E was an investigator-initiated study that was funded by Sanofi Pasteur MSD as part of 
the risk management plan for qHPV vaccine in France. The risk management plan targeted the 
surveillance for the following six groups of AI conditions: 
• 
• 
• 
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), 
connective tissue disorders (CTD) (undifferentiated connective tissue disorder, lupus 
erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis/juvenile arthritis, myositis and dermatomyositis), 
central demyelination and multiple sclerosis (CDMS), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014 
Page 21/42 
  
  
•  Guillain-Barré syndrome, 
• 
• 
type 1 diabetes mellitus, 
autoimmune thyroid disorders (ATDs) including Grave-Basedow and Hashimoto’s disease. 
PGRx (pharmacoepidemiologic general research program) is an on-going research platform that 
prospectively recruits cases of AI disorders to clinical registries in France using a network of centres 
specialized in research on AI disorders and representative pools of patients from general practice for 
the selection of controls. The recruitment is independent of any exposure to drugs or vaccines. 
The objective of Protocol GDS03E was to assess if exposure to qHPV vaccine was associated with an 
increased risk of developing pre-specified AI conditions or ATDs. For this study, case and control 
females aged 14 to 26 years who lived in France, could read, and could respond to a telephone 
interview (parents could be interviewed for participants under 18 years of age) were selected from 
these registries from December 2007 to April 2011. Vaccination with qHPV was first recommended by 
the French health authorities for this age group in 2006. Case definitions were based on 
internationally-accepted definitions for each disorder. Diagnoses were classified as definite, possible or 
rejected to allow patients to be recruited at early stages of the diseases. If confirmation of the 
diagnosis was needed, the patients were followed for up to one year. 
The exposure to qHPV vaccine and to risk factors was documented through interviews of the patients 
or of their parents (proxies). A total of 92% of cases and 84% of reported referents were interviewed. 
Objective confirmation for reported qHPV use (copy of prescription, copy of medical record, vaccine 
batch number, and vaccine package) was obtained for 97.4% patients.  Potential risk factors for AI 
disorders were documented, including age (continuous variable), region of residence and of birth of the 
patient (or of the patient’s parent), oral contraceptive use (within two years before the index date), 
smoking, alcohol consumption, exposure to a vaccine other than qHPV in the two years before the 
index date, occupation, presence of chronic comorbidities, number of drug used. A priori suspected risk 
factors and those found associated with disease status were summarized in a multivariate risk score. 
First-degree familial or personal history of autoimmune disorder (f/pHAID) was shown to be more 
frequent in cases than in controls (12.9% vs. 5.7% respectively). 
Cases and controls were randomly matched for age, region of residence and date of recruitment. Only 
controls with no history of AI disorders were selected as potential controls. A mean of four controls 
were matched to each case. Controls were selected for each of the six AI disorders and then different 
controls were selected for the combined analyses of all AI disorders. The multivariate risk score was 
applied to each patient for all multivariate studies, which were all controlled for the familial or personal 
history of autoimmune disorders. In addition, stratified analyses were done according to f/pHAID 
status. 
A total of 269 definite and possible cases and 1096 controls were recruited. The cases were not 
statistically different from the controls for all variables, except for oral contraceptive use within 24 
months of the index data (more frequent in controls; 49.4% vs. 58.6%; p=0.01), personal or family 
history of AI disorders (more frequent in cases;14.1%vs. 5.6%; p >0.001). Overall, the exposure to 
qHPV was consistent with estimates from French prescription data: 33.5% vs. 32.0% expected for the 
age-structure of the population. 
The planned primary analysis was for each AI conditions separately. Only patients with confirmed 
disease diagnosis and only confirmed exposure to qHPV in the primary time window at risk before the 
index date defined for each disease were included. The index date was the date of first symptom in the 
cases, applied to their matched controls. The primary time window at risk was 24 months for CTD, 
CDMS and ATD, 6 months for ITP and 2 months for GBS. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated 
using conditional logistic regression.

Protocol 070 (P070): post-licensure observational study of the safety of qHPV in males 
Protocol 070-01, "Post-Licensure Observational Study of the Safety of Gardasil in Males" is ongoing. 
This post-licensure observational study is conducted as a regulatory commitment to the FDA to assess 
the general safety of qHPV vaccine in males. This study is included in the risk management plan. 
The objective of the study is to assess the safety of qHPV vaccine in the general population of males 
who receive the vaccine during the course of routine clinical practice, with accrual of subjects starting 
at the date of initial licensure in the US for males (October 2009). The study is being conducted using 
a database from a large managed care organization in the United States, Kaiser Permanente. An 
external safety review committee (SRC) composed of experts in adolescent medicine, vaccine safety, 
autoimmune conditions, and pharmacoepidemiology has been established to review and evaluate the 
safety data emerging from the study. 
For the general safety analysis the incidence of medical events resulting in hospitalization or 
emergency room visit in the first 60 days after vaccination, relative to a self-comparison reference 
period will be analysed. The incidence of selected pre-specified events on the day of vaccination will 
also be analysed. In addition, it is also planned to follow subjects for six months after each vaccine 
dose to evaluate the occurrence of new onset cases of 20 specific autoimmune diseases (ADs). The 
study population will consist of either 44,000 males completing the 3-dose regimen of qHPV vaccine, 
135,000 males receiving at least 1 dose of qHPV vaccine, or the number of males accrued up to six 
years after study start. 
Prior to accrual of a pre-specified sample size (22,000 males), interim annual reports include only 
counts of outcome diagnosis codes, not incidence rates (IRs) or relative risks (RRs). The first interim 
report was submitted in August 2013 with the PSUR covering the period from 1st June 2012 to 31st 
May 2013. To be included, the subjects had to have been enrolled for at least 12 months in Kaiser 
Permanente. Among those who had been enrolled for ≥12 months, from October 2009 to December 
2011, 12,609 males had received ≥one dose of qHPV vaccine (38.4% had received two dose; 10.7% 
had received all three doses). A total of 18,805 doses were administered. The low number of males is 
explained by the study period analysed for this report, during which the accrual of males occurred 
mainly prior to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) universal recommendation 
(25 October 2011, published on 23 December 2011). 
France: Cohort study by ANSM on SNIIR-AM (French National Social Security) database 
To complement the European risk management plan (RMP) for HPV vaccines, the French drug safety 
agency, ANSM, has implemented a cohort study to study the risk of ADs in young girls exposed and 
not exposed to either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine. The study used data from the French 
National Social Security database (SNIIR-AM). In 2007, a cohort of young girls was established from 
those born between 1983 and 1996 (subjects were aged between 11 and 24 years) and followed for 
three years. To avoid possible bias due to girls changing from the general to a student social security 
system during the study, only girls aged 11 to 15 were included. 
Young girls with no reimbursement for a HPV vaccine (unexposed) and those with reimbursement for 
up to three HPV vaccines (exposed) and who had a long-term disorder recorded as an AD were eligible 
for inclusion. During the three-year period of the study the database was searched for new 
notifications for ADs; the date of notification was taken as the date of symptom onset. 
US: Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored study to evaluate safety of 
qHPV vaccine in females 
This observational study sponsored by the CDC involved 9-26 year-old females who received qHPV in 
one of seven large managed care organizations. The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) is a collaboration 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014

of managed care organizations that collects medical information on more than 9 million people every 
year. They have developed a real-time surveillance system to monitor potential adverse events 
following the licensure of new vaccines called Rapid Cycle Analysis (RCA). Between August 2006 and 
October 2009 600,558 doses of qHPV were administered.  Weekly sequential analyses were performed 
to detect associations between qHPV exposure and pre-specified outcomes, identified by ICD-9 codes. 
The outcomes evaluated were: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS); seizures; new onset seizures; syncope; 
appendicitis; stroke; venous thromboembolism (VTE); anaphylaxis; and other allergic reactions. For 
comparison, background rates were calculated using historical data for the less common outcomes 
(<150 cases per 100,000 person/years) and a concurrent unexposed comparison group for more 
common outcomes. 
Denmark and Sweden: Register-based cohort study to evaluate the safety of qHPV vaccine 
in females 
A register-based cohort study, sponsored by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research and the 
Danish Medical Research Council, included nearly 1 million adolescent girls aged between 10 and 17 
years in Denmark and Sweden among whom 29.8% had received at least one dose of qHPV vaccine in 
the first four years after its licensure. Among the vaccinated girls, 80.4% had received the second dose 
and 54.2% had received the third. Overall 696 420 doses of qHPV vaccine were administered. A total 
of 53 pre-defined outcomes (AI conditions, neurological conditions and VTE) were assessed using ICD-
10 codes. For the AI conditions and neurological outcomes the period at risk was defined as 180 days 
after exposure to vaccine and for VTE the period at risk was defined as 90 days. To be considered as a 
safety signal, the lower bound of the 95% CI of the rate ratio for an outcome with at least five qHPV 
vaccine-exposed cases had to be >1.0. Three criteria were considered as signal strengthening: 
analysis based on ≥20 qHPV exposed cases (reliability); a rate ratio of ≥3.0 (strength of association); 
and significantly increased rate ratios in both countries when analysed separately (consistency).

US: post-licensure safety surveillance study in females: Protocol 031-02 
All diagnosis codes listed for the hospitalizations or emergency room visits were grouped by healthcare 
cost and utilization project (HCUP) categories. Increases for Day 0 events were seen for three HCUP 
categories: epilepsy/convulsions, allergic events, and syncope. There were three events in both the 
epilepsy/convulsions and allergic events categories. The independent Safety Review Committee (SRC), 
consisted of five experts who were external to the investigator’s team conducting the study and to the 
sponsor. The SRC included: a general paediatrician⁄ clinical epidemiologist, a perinatologist ⁄ 
teratologist, a vaccinologist, a paediatric rheumatologist and a pharmacoepidemiologist. They 
concluded that there was no evidence of an association with qHPV for any of these Day 0 cases of 
epilepsy/convulsions and allergic events. There were 23 syncope cases that occurred on Day 0 in either 
the emergency room or hospital setting. The SRC stated that recipients of qHPV are at increased risk 
for syncope occurring on the day of vaccination. 
Based on the results of the general safety analysis and the subsequent chart review results, the SRC 
found no safety signals for diagnoses from emergency room visits or hospitalizations, with the 
exception of syncope on Day 0 and possibly, cellulitis, in the Day 1-14 risk period. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Safety data for qHPV vaccination in men: Protocol 020 
Serious adverse events 
A total of 19 subjects reported serious adverse experiences. Eight occurred in the qHPV vaccine group 
and 11 in the placebo group. This included the 13 deaths described in the section below. The 
remaining six subjects (five in the qHPV group and one in the placebo group) experienced nonfatal 
serious clinical adverse experiences during the study. None of these events were vaccine-related. 
Deaths

A total of 13 subjects died during the study. The percentage of subjects who died was higher in the 
placebo group than in the qHPV vaccine group (Table 8). Three subjects in the qHPV vaccine group and 
ten subjects in the placebo group died. None of the deaths were vaccine related. 
New medical conditions 
Overall, the proportions of subjects who reported new medical conditions, including conditions 
potentially indicative of an autoimmune phenomenon, Post Month 7 were comparable between the 
qHPV and placebo groups at the end of the base study. 
Long-term follow-up safety data in men: Protocol 020-21 
At the time of latest report, two SAEs had been reported; neither of them was vaccine-related. Subject 
AN 74389 had a subarachnoid haemorrhage with a fatal outcome. Subject AN 72841 had a myocardial 
infarction with a fatal outcome. 
New medical conditions 
More than 99% of all subjects reported no new medical conditions; less than 1% of all subjects had at 
least one new medical condition reported in the long-term extension study period. The new medical 
conditions reported were: vitiligo; psoriasis; hyperthyroidism; and type 1 diabetes mellitus. There was 
no specific pattern of new medical conditions in either group. 
Long-term safety data of qHPV vaccine in girls and boys: Protocol 018- 11 
There were three SAEs reported as occurring since Month 37 (relative to base study Day 1). Two were 
assessed as not vaccine-related and one case of VII nerve paralysis that occurred 131 days post-dose 
3, was assessed as vaccine-related by the investigator.

New medical conditions 
Approximately 47% and 45% of subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively, had at least one new 
medical history condition during the first 4 years of the long-term follow-up. For Cohort 1, 
approximately 23% had at least one new medical history condition during the second reporting 
interval, and for Cohort 2 it was approximately 24%. The most common new medical conditions 
included delivery in the pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC and perineoplasty in the 
surgical and medical procedures SOC. The number of subjects with cancers, conditions with a potential 
autoimmune aetiology, or who died, was minimal. Due to the low number of subjects with these 
conditions, comparison of the rates of these outcomes to published rates in the general population was 
not necessary. Overall, there was no specific pattern of new medical conditions within or between the 
two cohorts. 
In the base study, there were four subjects who had multiple sclerosis (MS). Two of the subjects had 
prevalent MS at enrolment (ANs 41573, 45062) and were subsequently vaccinated with qHPV vaccine 
and 2 subjects (ANs 44905, 49818) developed MS during the study. Both of the latter subjects were 
diagnosed with MS during the base study, had received placebo and did not receive qHPV vaccine 
subsequently. During the second reporting interval, there were two subjects who had a new medical 
history condition of MS. This brings the total number of subjects in the LTFU study with a new medical 
condition of MS to 3 (ANs 41025, 41376, 55090). These observed cases of MS are within the expected 
incidence for subjects of this age.

Autoimmune conditions 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014 
Page 26/42 
  
  
The study population for AI conditions surveillance included 189 629 women of all ages who received ≥
1 dose between August 2006 and March 2008. The women were followed for 180 days after each dose 
of qHPV to identify pre-specified AI conditions: 
a) Rheumatologic/Autoimmune: immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), autoimmune haemolytic anemia 
(AHA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and juvenile rheumatoid 
arthritis (JRA); 
b) Endocrine: insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (i.e., type 1 diabetes), Hashimoto’s and Graves’ 
disease; 
c) Neurologic/Ophthalmologic: multiple sclerosis (MS), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), 
other demyelinating diseases of the CNS, vaccine associated demyelination, Guillain-Barre syndrome 
(GBS), neuromyelitis optica, optic neuritis, and uveitis. 
A total of 149,306 of the 189,629 women meet the analysis inclusion criteria of having at least 12-
month KP membership and 719 potential new-onset AI diagnoses were identified in these women. A 
total of 318 were sampled for review by the case review committee (CRC). For each condition, the 
number of cases in the vaccinated KP Northern Californian (NC) population (actual number or 
projected number from the simulation) was small. Estimated incidence rates in the vaccinated KP 
Southern Californian (SC) population ranged from 1.14 per 100,000 person-years for ‘other 
demyelinating diseases of the CNS’ to 104.82 per 100,000 person-years for Hashimoto’s disease. The 
‘background’ incidence rates of the autoimmune conditions in the non-vaccinated female population 
aged 9–26 years old were estimated to be comparable with those the observed in the vaccinated 
women, using the population at KPSC only. For the non-vaccinated population, incidence rates ranged 
from 1.60 to 81.10 per 100,000 person-years for the same conditions. The incidence estimates in the 
non-vaccinated population and in the vaccinated population were considered to be significantly 
different if the rate ratio confidence interval excluded 1.0. For optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), 
immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Hashimoto’s disease, the 
estimated rate ratio was higher than 1.0, but the difference was statistically significant for Hashimoto's 
disease only. An additional sensitivity analysis for Hashimoto’s disease was undertaken, in which the 
main analysis was repeated but the background population was limited to individuals with at least one 
KPSC health care encounter in 2005 (i.e., the year prior to qHPV licensure). The resulting RR (CI) was 
also increased. For ITP results for six cases confirmed as new onset after vaccination at KPSC. For 
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDM), the incidence rates 
were significantly lower in the vaccinated population. For the remaining four conditions, the rate ratio 
was less than 1.0, but not significantly decreased. 
France: post-licensure safety surveillance study for pre-specified autoimmune diseases in 
females: Protocol GDS03E 
Autoimmune conditions 
In three groups of autoimmune diseases studied, exposures of cases and controls to qHPV were very 
similar and the odds ratios estimates were close to 1: 
• 
• 
For idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), 6 (15.0%) out of 40 definite cases and 33 
(18.0%) out of 183 controls were exposed to qHPV during the primary time window (6 
months). The matched adjusted odds ratio was 0.96 (95% CI 0.35, 2.64). In patients without 
f/pHAID, the adjusted odds ratio was 1.17 (95% CI 0.36, 3.76). All cases were definite and 
none of the secondary analyses or sensitivity analyses displayed any different result. 
For Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 9 (23.7%) out of 38 definite cases and 41 (20.3%) out of 
202 controls were exposed to qHPV during the primary time window (24 months). The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014 
Page 27/42 
  
  
matched adjusted OR for qHPV exposure was 1.21 (95% CI 0.38, 3.58). In patients without 
f/pHAID, the adjusted OR was 1.06 (95% CI 0.36, 3.10). Two cases were possible and none of 
the secondary or sensitivity analyses displayed any different result. 
• 
For connective tissue disorders (CTD), 6 (12.2%) out of 49 definite cases and 37 (18.5%) out 
of 200 controls were exposed to qHPV during the primary time window (24 months).  The 
matched adjusted OR for qHPV exposure was 0.83 (95% CI 0.29, 2.37). In patients without 
f/pHAID, the adjusted OR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.15, 2.40). The subgroup analyses for lupus and 
inflammatory arthritis were in opposite directions; OR= 0.41 (95% CI 0.08 - 2.20) and 
OR=1.52 (95% CI 0.32 - 7.15), respectively but the number of cases was very small. 
• 
For a fourth disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome, the observed incidence was within the expected 
limits; the absence of qHPV exposure is likely to be explained by chance, considering the small 
number of cases involved: 
•  0 (0.0%) out of 15 definite cases of Guillain- Barré Syndrome (GBS) and 7 (7.7%) out of 91 
controls were exposed to qHPV during the primary time window (8 weeks). Odds ratios were 
not calculable. However, the absence of exposure in cases was within statistical expectations 
considering the small number of cases and the short time window considered: the 95% 
confidence interval of the probability to be exposed in the case population was [0-0.218], 
which translates in terms of number of cases, to [0- 3.27]. The expected number of exposed 
cases, assuming an OR of 1, is 1, which is included in the 95% CI. 
• 
For two disorders, the observed exposure of cases to qHPV vaccine was lower than that of 
controls: 
o  For central demyelination or multiple sclerosis, 4 (4.8%) out of 83 definite cases and 
48 (16.6%) out of 290 controls were exposed to qHPV vaccine during the primary time 
window (24 months). The adjusted OR for qHPV vaccine exposure was 0.28 (95% CI 
[0.09 - 0.89]) overall and 0.55 (95% CI 0.17, 1.77) in patients without f/pHAID. No 
clear explanation was found for these results; the differences in the odds ratios for the 
overall and stratified analysis by familial or personal history of AI disorders, leaves the 
possibility of some uncontrolled residual confounding. 
o  For autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITD), 39.1% of the 46 reported cases had been 
rejected initially by the clinical algorithm (73.7% for autoimmune thyroiditis and 
14.8% for Grave-Basedow disease). Among the 46 cases reported, 44 cases were 
eligible incident cases; 42 of these cases could be interviewed (38 definite cases and 4 
possible cases). The main analysis showed that 1 (2.6%) was exposed to qHPV vaccine 
during the primary time window (24 months) whereas 34 (20.1%) out of 169 controls 
were exposed. Adjusted odds ratios were not calculable. These observations should be 
considered cautiously because of the difficulties to diagnose AITD. 
In the combined analysis using definite cases of all studied AID, the matched adjusted OR for qHPV 
exposure was 0.72 (95% CI 0.45, 1.18). In patients without reported f/pHAID, the adjusted OR for 
qHPV vaccine exposure was 0.63 (95% CI 0.36, 1.09); in patients who reported f/pHAID, it was 0.64 
(95% CI 0.16, 2.49). When AITD was not considered in the combined analysis, the adjusted odds ratio 
was 0.90 (95% CI 0.54, 1.49). 
Protocol 070 (P070): post-licensure observational study of the safety of qHPV in males 
Because accrual was less than 22,000 for this first interim report, it is limited to counts of claim codes. 
For the general safety analysis a variety of codes were identified in both the risk and comparison (i.e. 
control) periods. The HCUP categories with the highest combined ER/hospital outcome counts between

the Day 1 and Day 60 post-vaccination risk interval for all doses combined were similar to those in the 
post-vaccination self-comparison period. 
The identification of no events related to syncope, epilepsy/convulsions, head trauma and allergic 
reactions on Day 0 is reflective of the rarity of these outcomes. 
For the AI conditions analysis, 12 potential cases with an unconfirmed diagnosis of new-onset 
autoimmune disease were electronically identified in the cohort of males who had received the qHPV 
vaccine (n= 4,898) and 17 were identified in a matched comparison cohort of males who had not 
receive the qHPV vaccinate (n= 4,898). Medical record review and adjudication are currently being 
conducted for potential autoimmune cases and findings will be presented in future annual reports. 
During the Days 1-60 post-vaccination risk interval for all doses combined, 7 VTE outcomes were 
identified among males in the general safety cohorts, and 3 VTE outcomes were identified during the 
post-vaccination self-control period. Claims-profile review and medical record review will be conducted 
for potential VTE cases identified among the general safety cohort. 
Two deaths were identified from claims codes in the cohort of males who received the qHPV vaccine. 
The cause and timing of death relative to vaccination will be summarized and provided in the next 
study report. 
France: Cohort study by ANSM on SNIIR-AM (French National Social Security) database 
A total of 1,774,622 girls aged from 11 to 15 years were included in the study cohort; 33.8% had been 
reimbursed for at least one HPV vaccine. The mean age of the first reimbursement was 15 years. After 
three years of follow-up, 1,103 subjects had received specific cover for an AD. In November 2011, and 
interim analysis showed that the incidence rate for all ADs was not significantly different between 
those who had been exposed to HPV vaccination and those who had not. There were 2.01/10,000 
patients/years in those exposed to HPV versus 2.09/10,000 patient/years for those unexposed to HPV; 
HR = 1.08 [0.91 – 1.29]. 
US: Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored study to evaluate safety of 
qHPV vaccine in females 
The publication reported data from 164 weeks during which time 600,558 doses of qHPV vaccine were 
administered in the VSD population: 416,942 to youths and 183,616 to adults. The risk of seizures, 
new-onset seizures, allergic reactions or syncope were not statistically significant increased for either 
the youth or adult populations. Only one of the 27 cases of anaphylaxis observed was confirmed as 
being qHPV vaccine-related after medical record review; the estimated rate of anaphylaxis was 1.7 
cases per million doses (95% CI: 0.004, 9.3). 
Eight cases of VTE were identified compared with the expected number of four. Five of the cases were 
confirmed as VTE by medical record review; all five had other risk factors. Two of the other cases were 
miscoded and the last case was ruled out after diagnostic testing. A signal for appendicitis in youths 
was observed, however investigations showed that coding practices for appendicitis at one of the sites 
had changed due to a modification of the electronic medical record system that lead to a lower 
background rate. No significant clusters were observed and a logistic regression analysis showed a 
non-significant association (OR=1.13; 95% CI: 0.84-1.26). In addition, case-centred analyses showed 
no association between vaccination and subsequent appendicitis. 
There was one case of GBS among the adults but medical record review showed this was not an 
incident case. Two cases of stroke were observed among the adults, with a non-statistically significant 
RR of 1.33. There was no statistically significant increased risk for appendicitis or VTE among the 
adults.

Denmark and Sweden: Register-based cohort study to evaluate the safety of qHPV vaccine 
in females 
A total of 29 of the 53 assessed outcomes satisfied the criterion for further analysis (≥5 qHPV vaccine-
exposed cases). The rate ratios for the five neurological outcomes analysed were not significantly 
increased; the rate ratios were significantly decreased for epilepsy and paralysis. The rate ratio for VTE 
was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.55-1.36). The rate ratios for 20 of the 23 AI conditions were not significantly 
increased. Each of the three AI conditions with a statistically increased rate ratio satisfied only one of 
the signal strengthening criteria: 
•  ≥20 qHPV-exposed cases: Raynaud’s disease and type-1 diabetes 
• 
rate ratio ≥3.0: Behcet’s syndrome 
The rate ratios for these three events were similar in the period starting on day 181 after qHPV vaccine 
exposure to those in the period up to 180 days. In addition, the temporal distribution of the cases 
showed a random pattern (this was inconclusive for Behcet’s disease as there were only five cases). 
Thus, there is no consistent evidence for a plausible association for these three AI conditions. 
Post marketing experience 
a) Worldwide safety data for males and females 
An aggregate analysis tool (METEOR) has been used to review the worldwide safety data, by gender, 
(male compared with female/ unknown gender excluded) included in marketed case adverse events 
(AEs) reported by healthcare providers (HCP) and entered into Merck’s safety data base (MARRS) as 
temporally related to the administration of qHPV vaccine from the time of market introduction (01st 
June 2006) up to 31st May 2013. Since it is unknown what percentage of the doses distributed have 
been used to vaccinate males vs. females, it is not possible to reliably estimate a reporting rate of 
adverse events for each group. However, the distribution and percentage of AEs by SOC in males can 
be viewed in comparison to the overall distribution of AEs by SOC in females. 
Aggregate data at the SOC level displaying the number of distinct case reports for each SOC as well as 
the percentage of the total number of case reports included in each SOC by gender was provided. The 
three SOCs with the highest percentage of total reports for both genders include: 
• 
• 
• 
general disorders and administration site conditions; 
injury, poisoning and procedural complications;  
nervous system disorders. 
Over the period of this analysis (1st June 2006 up to 31st May 2013), there have been 56,784 AE 
reports received from HCPs in the marketed environment temporally associated with the receipt of 
qHPV vaccine worldwide; 13% of these reports were serious. A total of 48,065 (85%) of the reports 
involved females; 1807 (3.2%) of the reports involved males; the gender was unknown in the 
remaining reports. The number of doses distributed worldwide cumulative to 31 May 2013 is 
approximately 127,234,506. The percentage of doses administered to males and females is unknown. 
The distribution of case reports by SOC is similar for both genders as demonstrated by the top three 
SOCs with the highest percentage of reports being the same for both: general disorders and 
administration site conditions (46.6% female / 48.7% male); injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications (33.2% female / 31.8% male); and nervous system disorders (33.2% female / 39.0% 
male). The most frequently reported events for each of the three SOCS are also similar for males and 
females with the exception of those that occur in the injury, poisoning and procedural complications 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014 
Page 30/42 
  
  
SOC. The most marked difference in this SOC is the report of exposure to vaccine during pregnancy in 
the female group. 
There were 1,313 and 32,231 AEs in the general disorders and administration site conditions SOC, for 
males and females, respectively. The 10 most frequently reported terms accounted for 69% of the 
events in this SOC for males and 66% for females. Therefore, the distribution of the AEs within the 
general disorders and administration site conditions SOC is similar for males and females. The 
preferred terms (PTs) asthenia, fatigue, injection site reactions, malaise, and pyrexia are included in 
the Company Core Data Sheet (CCDS). 
There were 702 and 18,360 AEs in the injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC for males 
and females, respectively. The 10 most frequently reported terms accounted for 76% of the events in 
this SOC for males and 84% for females. Therefore, the distribution of the AEs within this SOC is 
similar for males and females. The main difference is the number of pregnancy exposures in the 
female group. The majority of reports of fall in both males (63%) and females (66%) and reports of 
head injury in males (71%) also include the terms of syncope and/or dizziness. 
There were 1,051 and 25,691 AEs in the nervous system disorder SOC, for males and females, 
respectively. The 10 most frequently reported terms accounted for 81% of the events in this SOC for 
males and 76% for females. Therefore, the distribution of the AEs within this SOC is similar for males 
and females. The PTs of dizziness, headache, pre-syncope, and syncope are included in the CCDS. 
In conclusion, the AE profile for males is similar to that for females and comparable, with males and 
females having the same three most commonly affected SOCs (the general disorders and 
administration site conditions SOC, the injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC, and the 
nervous system disorders SOC). The main difference between the males and females appeared to be in 
terms of the top 10 PTs that were reported in the injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC 
for each gender. This is primarily due to the reports of ‘exposure to vaccine during pregnancy’ that are 
reported in for females. 
b) Background incidence rates of potential adverse events in adolescent boys vs. adolescent girls– 
assessment of temporal associations 
A literature review was conducted in order to identify the background incidence rates of potential 
adverse events likely to be temporally associated with Gardasil vaccination (auto-immune disease and 
allergic events) in adolescent boys. 
Results 
Overall, in Europe, one study describing the background incidence rate of several auto-immune 
diseases in adolescent boys (10-17 years old) was found. The background incidence rates of auto-
immune diseases within the same age-group (10-17 years old) were also described for females, 
allowing for comparisons. Another Danish study described the male vs. female ratio within the target 
age-group of vaccination (12-15 year old) for several diseases, likely to be temporally associated to 
vaccination in adolescents. Among industrialized countries, one study in the US provides the 
background incidence rate of auto-immune diseases in adolescent boys and girls (10-17 years old). 
Finally, an Australian study described the background incidence rate of several events likely to be 
temporally associated to vaccination in adolescent boys.  
Overall, the background rates of auto-immune diseases tended to be either lower or non-statistically 
different in adolescent boys compared to adolescent girls. 
The only events for which the background incidence rates were found to be statistically higher in 
adolescent boys compared to adolescent girls were:

• 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
In the 2 Danish studies, incidence of Type 1 diabetes mellitus was higher in adolescent boys compared 
to adolescent girls: 
• 
• 
Incidence in boys: 27.48 (95% CI: 26.12 to 28.90) per 100 000 vs. 23.98 (95% CI : 22.69 to 
25.34) per 100 000 in girls aged 10-17 years old;  
F/M incidence rate ratio of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.60 -0.84). 
The same observation was not made in the US study, where incidence rates between adolescent boys 
and girls were not statistically significant (27.7 [95% CI: 21.9 to 34.5] per 100 000 in boys 10-17 
years old vs. 28.2 [95% CI: 22.4- 35.2] per 100 000 in girls aged 10-17 years old): 
•  Allergic rhinitis: F/M incidence ratio = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.69 - 0.86);  
•  Allergic conjunctivitis: F/M incidence ratio = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.54 - 0.89);  
•  Death from unknown cause: 0.76 (95% CI: 0.55 to 1.02) per 100 000 vs. 0.26 (95% CI: 0.14 
to 0.44) per 100 000 in adolescent boys vs. adolescent girls, respectively.  
Also, the study of Clothier summarized the number of events expected to occur by chance following 
the introduction of boys’ vaccination in Australia. Assuming a 80% vaccination rate with three doses 
per person in the population of 12 to 16 years old boys in Australia – which equates to approximately 
to 480 000 boys vaccinated per year within the first two year of vaccination - it was expected that 
about 2.4 episodes of Guillain-Barré syndrome would be expected within 6 weeks of vaccination. In 
addition, it was expected that about 3.9 episodes of seizures and 6.5 of acute allergy presentations 
would be expected to occur within 1 day of vaccination, including 0.3 episodes of anaphylaxis.

Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNV) / Number Needed to Harm (NNH) -Brief overview of 
results  
Introduction 
The applicant has estimated the absolute benefit of preventing anal cancer with qHPV vaccine through 
the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNV) methodology, and has balanced these NNV estimates with 
estimations of the absolute risks of vaccinating the general population in the perspective of this 
indication, through the Number Needed to Harm (NNH) methodology. 
The objectives of this analysis were: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the Benefit/Risk balance of qHPV vaccine vaccination in the perspective of 
anal cancer prevention in the general population in the EU using the NNV/NNH 
methodology;  
To put into perspective the NNV estimates for anal cancer with the NNV estimates for 
other HPV-related diseases (genital warts and cervical cancer). 
The NNV/NNH are widely used in clinical practice because they are simple to calculate and to interpret 
for a single event or a single disease. Still, they present a number of limitations, which limit their use 
for decision making purposes and for which they have been heavily criticized: they are highly 
dependent on the baseline incidence of developing a disease (or "risk at baseline") in a population and 
of the time horizon considered, as such, they cannot be seen as a property of an intervention and a 
result obtained in a given population may not be applicable in to a population with a different level  of 
risk for the condition of interest; they do not allow to account for several benefits and several harms in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014 
Page 32/42 
  
  
a single evaluation, which may be particularly a problem for decision making regarding a vaccine; 
finally, they do not account by themselves for clinical relevance, severity , utility or for the perceived 
"value of the benefit" or "value of the risk" and may lead to logically unsound decisions by focusing on 
probability differences only. 
Method overview 
NNV were defined as NNV = 1 / (r0–rV) where r0 and rV represents the risk of the disease over a fixed 
period of time in absence of vaccination and with vaccination, respectively; rV was defined as rV = r0 * 
(1–VE); where VE represents the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing the disease over the fixed 
period of time. VE for HPV16/18 related anal cancer was considered to vary between 70 to 100%. The 
target population for vaccination considered was 12 year-old boys and/or 12 year-old girls living in the 
EMA territory and the time horizon considered was the remaining life span of this cohort. NNV were 
primarily estimated for anal cancer (boys and/or girls) but also for genital warts (boys and/or girls) 
and cervical cancer (girls).  
The lifetime risk of developing HPV16/18 related anal cancer, r0, was based on the incidence rates 
currently observed, which is mainly driven by subjects currently in an age group at risk of developing 
anal cancer (mean age = 60 years old).  This therefore requires a correction to take into account the 
increasing incidence trend consistently observed in the EMA territory over recent decades; this trend is 
likely to persist and to affect the incidence rate that will be observed when subjects being vaccinated 
now (12 years old) are at an age at risk of developing anal cancer. Based on recent EU literature data, 
several assumptions of future increasing trends have been suggested, ranging between 34% and 
100% increase within 40 years. In addition, even if unlikely, the assumption of 0% increase of anal 
cancer incidence was considered too, in order to provide a global overview of the possible results.  
NNH for potential adverse events were defined as NNH = 1 / (rV – r0), where r0 and rV represents the 
incidence rate of the event of interest in the placebo group/control group and in the vaccinated group, 
respectively. The choice of potential adverse events relied on concerns that were raised initially at 
licensure, disregardful of the results of post-licensure studies. The potential adverse events chosen 
were serious adverse events (SAE), syncope, auto-immune diseases (AID) and hypersensitivity. These 
events were considered within the period defined as being at risk after vaccination in the studies, i.e., 
1 day for syncope and hypersensitivity (Day 0), 14 days for SAE and 6 months for AID. Data source 
used were either the pooled Gardasil clinical trial data, when power was sufficient, or large 
observational post-authorization safety studies in which incidence rates were available. 
Results overview 
Depending on the assumption used regarding VE (70% to 100%) and the expected increase in anal 
cancer incidence within the next 40 years (0% to 100%), between 571 and 1 631 individuals aged 12 
year-old would need to be vaccinated in order to prevent one case of HPV16/18 related anal cancer 
(see Table 9 for detailed results by assumption). When considering males only, depending on the 
assumption used, between 798 and 2 279 boys aged 12 year-old would need to be vaccinated in order 
to prevent one case of HPV16/18 related anal cancer (see Table 10 for detailed results by assumption). 
In addition, between 8 and 10 boys aged 12 year-old would need to be vaccinated in order to prevent 
an episode of genital warts.

NNH were evaluated for SAE, syncope, hypersensitivity and AID. The NNH point estimate for SAE was 
less than 0 (-716) based on the pooled data of all qHPV vaccine clinical trial. The NNH point estimate 
for syncope varied between 91 and over 12 000, depending on the data source used. The NNH point 
estimated for hypersensitivity was less than 0 (-699) based on a large post-authorization safety study 
in females, but the variability of the respective incidence rates among vaccinated (rV) and non-
vaccinated (r0) was compatible with a null absolute difference and thus an infinite NNH. The NNH point 
estimate for AID varied from 49 505 to less than 0 (- 4 760) depending on the data source used. When 
looking at each individual AID, either no statistically significant difference was observed between the 
vaccine and the control group, or the difference was not judged clinically relevant, leading to think that 
the actual risk difference is most probably close to 0 for each individual auto-immune disease, and 
thus, that the NNH for AID is most probably close to infinity.  
Based on these results, the NNH was only clinically relevant for syncope, for which between 91 and 
over 12 000 individuals depending on the study considered would need to be vaccinated to experience 
it. It is to be noted that syncope is common to any vaccination procedures and thus is not-specific of 
qHPV vaccine. Besides, syncope may be avoided by close post-vaccination surveillance. For all other

potential adverse events studied, a negative NNH point estimate was part of the possible results, so 
the absence of detrimental effect of qHPV vaccine on the safety parameter of interest could not be 
excluded. Also, the wide variability of NNH, including either positive or negative values depending on 
the study for the same event, and the possibility that the actual risk difference (rV-r0) could be null or 
close to 0 leads to think that an infinite NNH cannot be excluded for these events. For all these 
reasons, we interpret this as qHPV vaccine having no detrimental effect compared to placebo/absence 
of vaccination on SAE, hypersensitivity and AID. 
MAH Conclusions 
The absolute benefits of qHPV vaccine for the prevention of anal cancer in the general population, 
particularly in males, is substantial and would help addressing an increasing medical need. In 
comparison, the only adverse event for which a clinically relevant harm could be identified is syncope, 
which is frequently observed after all vaccination procedures and is avoidable. For all other possible 
adverse events considered, the absence of difference between the vaccine and the control group, 
resulting in an infinite number of subjects that would need to be vaccinated to experience it and in the 
absence of harm of qHPV vaccine could not be excluded. For all these reasons, the Benefit/Risk 
balance of qHPV vaccine in the prevention of anal cancer in the general population, and in males in 
particular, was found to be positive, as the potential risks do not outweigh the important determined 
benefits. 
Multi-criteria Decision analysis (MCDA and PrOACT-URL) 
Introduction 
In order to overcome some of the NNV/NNH approach limitations, the MAH has used another 
complementary approach to evaluate the Benefit/Risk balance: the Multi-criteria decision analysis 
(MCDA) and PrOACT-URL framework. Given the differences between males and females in both the 
choice of the effects and the data sources to be used, as well as the specific interest of the benefit risk 
(BR) assessment for males, a model for males only was developed. The benefit/risk profile of qHPV 
vaccine in females is widely recognized as being positive and is not questioned. Including a new 
indication for females would only improve this Benefit/Risk profile.  
MCDA is an eight-step procedure. The main purpose of MCDA is to bring together evaluations of 
options on different criteria into one overall evaluation. It does this through two separate processes: 
scoring and weighting. Scoring is the process of measuring the value of options, one criterion at a 
time, using scaling techniques. Weighting ensures that the units of value on all the criteria are 
comparable, which is necessary for combining the scales into one overall scale. MCDA solves the 
problem of comparing benefits and risks by providing a common unit of value so that the added value 
of favourable effects can be compared to the loss of value from the unfavourable effects. 
In the first step, an assessment using the PrOACT/MCDA approach was made based on internal 
expertise only. This internal assessment served as the basis for the second step, which relied upon 
input from a number of external experts. This report summarizes the BR assessment based upon the 
external expert input (step 2). Six experts from the United Kingdom, France, Austria and Spain were 
chosen for their expertise in HPV related diseases, or in HPV vaccination or in qualitative and 
quantitative BR methodology. 
The assessment compares qHPV vaccine to ‘no vaccination’ as the sole alternative option. A large value 
tree taking into account all the relevant effects (benefits/risks) applicable to qHPV vaccine, including 
those of females, was trimmed down to a simpler value tree. The trimming took out those effects that 
were either not applicable to the male population or for which the available data showed no difference 
between qHPV vaccine and control. Whereas the criteria serious adverse events (SAEs) and auto 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014 
Page 35/42 
  
  
immune disease (AIDs) could also have been taken out on the basis of no observed difference in 
several studies, these criteria were left in, for transparency sake. 
The final value tree included three benefits effects (anal cancer, genital warts and HPV transmission) 
and six risk effects (adverse events AE, serious adverse events as adverse effect observed in clinical 
trials; syncope and hypersensitivity as identified risks; auto immune diseases as potential risks; and 
unanticipated safety signal as potential for non-demonstrated additional risk). 
Two effects tables were built: one for the criteria reflecting the benefits and one for the criteria 
reflecting the risks. Studies that closely reflect the expected use of qHPV vaccine in the general male 
population (adolescent boys) and are of sufficient sample size were taken as preferred data sources. 
For criteria with no or insufficient data in the young male population, studies from older males or from 
females were selected. The effects were expressed in absolute measures to allow comparison of the 
benefits and risks. 
The observed effects of the different criteria were measured on a scale that ranges from the best to 
the worst anticipated extremes. Extremes were chosen close to the actual observed effects so as to 
best discriminate between the two options. Where possible, the range between the two extremes was 
kept constant across the different criteria. The respective scores of the options within these scales 
were transformed into values ranging from 0 to 100 using a linear value function. 
A survey and a consensus meeting were held among the 6 external experts on the relative weights to 
be assigned to the criteria and groups of criteria in the value tree. Experts weighted the prevention of 
anal cancer among the benefits and the potential risk of SAEs among the risks as the two most 
important effects in the BR model. 
Several sensitivity analyses were undertaken in order to see if any criterion could drive to a preference 
of no vaccination if given a different weight. In addition to sensitivity analyses within the primary 
model, five alternative models were construed as additional sensitivity analyses. 
Results 
The primary BR assessment model suggested a superior benefit-risk score for qHPV vaccine compared 
to no vaccination (scores of 66 and 46 for qHPV vaccine and no vaccination, respectively). The effects 
that contributed most to the difference between the two alternatives were genital warts and anal 
cancer among the benefits and AEs and AIDs among the potential risks.  
In all of the alternative models used, qHPV vaccine maintained a better benefit-risk profile compared 
to no vaccination. In the analysis most challenging to qHPV vaccine, the BR scores difference between 
the two options decreased to 5 points, compared to the primary model with a difference of 20 points. 
In this analysis only study 018 was used as source data for SAEs. 
MAH Conclusion 
The assessment showed qHPV vaccine to have a positive BR profile with prevention of anal cancer and 
genital warts as the most important beneficial effects. The result was robust to changes to the 
individual weights on the criteria or nodes. qHPV vaccine was also the preferred option when using the 
lower limit of the efficacy against AIN, or when using less favourable assumptions on the rates of 
hypersensitivity and SAEs following qHPV vaccine. 
2.7.  Discussion on additional data provided 
The NNV/NNH analysis was considered inappropriate as a tool to determine the benefit risk balance for 
qHPV vaccine in the prevention of anal cancer. The methodology itself did not allow a weighting of 
risks and benefits, and is therefore not considered sufficient. However, the NNV figures were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014 
Page 36/42 
  
  
considered of interest in the overall benefit risk evaluation. It was noted that the NNV for cervical 
cancer was much lower compared to the NNV for anal cancer, which was expected. 
MCDA is a method considered to be useful as a complementary and supportive tool. Through a number 
of steps the purpose is to bring together evaluations of options on both benefits and risks into one 
overall evaluation taking into account what is considered best current evidence.  It was noted that 
subjective assessments are also needed.  
Overall, the MCDA analysis was considered of interest. The model has been discussed in the Benefit-
risk methodology project Work package 2 report, issued by EMA. The results appear to be consistently 
in favour of qHPV vaccine over no vaccination using several different sensitivity analyses. 
2.8.  Update to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the SmPC sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1 and to the package 
leaflet (PL), to which the CHMP agreed (new text is marked underlined and deleted text marked as 
strikethrough):  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Gardasil/Silgard is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of: 
premalignant  genital  lesions  (cervical,  vulvar  and  vaginal),  premalignant  anal  lesions,    and 
– 
cervical  and  anal  cancers    and  anal  cancers  causally  related  to  certain  oncogenic  Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) types 
– 
genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to specific HPV types.  
See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support this indication. 
The use of Gardasil should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Long-term  follow-up  studies  are  currently  ongoing  to  determine  the  duration  of  protection  The 
duration of protection is currently unknown. Sustained protective efficacy has been observed for 4.5 
years after completion of the 3-dose series. Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing (see section 
5.1). 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Mechanism of Action 
HPV 16 and HPV 18 are estimated to be responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers and 
75-80%  of  anal  cancers;  80%  of  adenocarcinoma  in  situ  (AIS);  45-70%  of  high-grade  cervical 
intraepithelial  neoplasia  (CIN  2/3);  25%  of  low  grade  cervical  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (CIN  1); 
approximately  70%  of  HPV  related  high-grade  vulvar  (VIN  2/3)  and  vaginal  (VaIN  2/3) 
intraepithelial neoplasia and 80% of HPV related high-grade anal (AIN 2/3) intraepithelial neoplasia. 
HPV 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90% of genital warts and 10% of low grade cervical 
intraepithelial  neoplasia  (CIN  1).  CIN  3  and  AIS  have  been  accepted  as  immediate  precursors  of 
invasive cervical cancer. 
The  term  "premalignant  genital  lesions"  in  section  4.1  corresponds  to  high-grade  cervical 
intraepithelial  neoplasia  (CIN  2/3),  high-grade  vulvar  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (VIN  2/3)  and  high-
grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 2/3). 
The  term  "premalignant  anal  lesions"  in  section  4.1  corresponds  to  high-grade  anal  intraepithelial 
neoplasia (AIN 2/3). 
Efficacy in men 16 through 26 years 
Efficacy  was  evaluated  against  HPV  6-,  11-,  16-,  18-related  external  genital  warts, 
penile/perineal/perianal intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) grades 1/2/3, and persistent infection.

subjects were seropositive by cLIA and IgG LIA, respectively, 6 years after vaccination. In the Phase 
III  study  in  men  16  through  26  years,  after  a  median  follow-up  of  2.9  years,  88.9  %,  94.0%, 
97.9 % and 57.1% of individuals who received Gardasil/Silgard in the per-protocol immunogenicity 
population  were  anti-HPV  6,  anti-HPV  11,  anti-HPV  16  and  anti-HPV  18  seropositive  in  the  cLIA, 
respectively. 
Package leaflet 
1.   What Gardasil/Silgard is and what it is used for  
These diseases include cervical cancer; pre-cancerous lesions of the female genitals (cervix, vulva, and 
vagina); pre-cancerous lesions of the anus and genital warts in males and females; cervical and anal 
cancers. HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases, 75-80 
% of anal cancer cases; and 70% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina; 75 % 
of HPV related pre-cancerous lesions of the anus. HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for 
approximately 90% of genital wart cases. 
2.9.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that study P020, which is contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation 
Plan and has been completed after 26 January 2007, is considered significant. 
3.  Benefit-risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The data regarding protection against anal cancer were already assessed in variation EMA/H/C/00703-
732/WS/0029. The conclusions regarding anal cancer and premalignant anal lesions that were made in 
variation EMA/H/C/00703-732/WS/0029 are still valid and indicate that significant efficacy has been 
demonstrated:  
“In the MSM substudy of Protocol 020, there were few cases of anal premalignant lesions (AIN 2/3) but 
significant efficacy was demonstrated. Also for the most relevant endpoint, i.e. HPV 16/18-related AIN 
2/3, vaccine efficacy was high (86.6% (95%CI: 0.0, 99.7), although statistical significance was barely 
reached. Supporting evidence was the consistent vaccine efficacy across all severity grades of AIN in 
all populations studied. In addition, a post-hoc analysis in HPV naïve MSM showed high efficacy against 
anal persistent infection due to HPV 16 and 18 (VE 95% and 100%, respectively). Extrapolation of 
data from anal disease in MSM to anal HPV infection and related disease in heterosexual men and 
women is accepted. 
The vaccine-induced immune responses in men aged 16-26 years were robust, and generally 
comparable to those in women aged 16-26 years. As in females, the low persistence of GMTs and 
seropositivity as measured by cLIA for HPV 18 at Month 36 did not translate into loss of efficacy, but 
will have to be closely monitored in the future. On the basis of immunogenicity bridging data in adult 
males, using Protocols 016 and 018, protection against genital warts can be inferred in 9-15 year old 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014

males.” 
In the data presented in the current variation, the duration of protection has been followed for up to 7 
years in the long-term follow-up Protocol 020-21. The study was descriptive, but there was no sign of 
waning protection against the more common outcomes (e.g. condyloma). The more uncommon 
outcomes AIN2/3 and cancer were only reported during the base study, no cases were reported during 
the extended follow-up phase of the study.  
Results from extension studies provided immunogenicity follow-up data up to 8 years in girls and boys 
who received qHPV vaccine at 9-18 years of age. The immune responses reached a plateau value 
approximately 24 month after vaccination and thereafter the decline was slow.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The absolute benefit of protection against anal cancer is considered limited, because the incidence of 
anal cancer is low in the general population. The MAH has argued that the incidence is increasing, but 
there are uncertainties as to the magnitude of this increase. 
The duration of protection against premalignant anal lesions and anal cancer is currently unknown. It is 
considered to be the same as the duration of protection against cervical lesions, but the incidence of 
anal cancer most likely peaks at a higher age. However, the cause of anal cancer, i.e. HPV infection, is 
likely to occur within 5-20 years of vaccination in most cases and there is no reason to believe that the 
acquisition pattern of HPV differs substantially between men and women. Considering that the duration 
of follow-up has been extended by approximately 3 years, and that the immune responses appear to 
decline slowly once a plateau value has been reached, the uncertainties regarding duration of 
protection are now considered reduced compared to what was known previously. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Male subjects who received HPV vaccination experienced local injection site reactions which were mild 
or moderate in intensity. Overall, the injection site adverse experience profile in boys and men was 
generally comparable to the profile in girls and women. Review of post-marketing data reveal that 
males have reported similar adverse events after vaccination compared to females, including episodes 
of syncope, dizziness, headache and loss of consciousness.  
Overall, the review of supportive long-term studies does not reveal a significantly increased risk for 
autoimmune conditions after receipt of vaccination. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are non-statistically significant associations with certain autoimmune conditions and/or adverse 
events of interest (for example venous thromboembolism), which could potentially suggest that a 
small increase in risk cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, for other conditions there is no 
association or there is lower incidence in patients exposed to qHPV vaccine. The relevance of these 
findings is unknown but the uncertainties regarding rare unknown adverse events are now considered 
smaller compared to what was known previously. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014 
Page 39/42 
  
  
There is currently no screening program for early detection of anal cancer/premalignancies, and no 
effective means of preventing anal cancer. Anal cancer is still a relatively rare condition, with an 
incidence of 0.1 to 1.4 per 100 000 in men and 0.1 to 2.2 in women, but some data indicate that the 
incidence may progressively increase in the future. Currently, approximately 27,000 new cases of anal 
cancer are estimated to occur annually around the world. In Europe, it is estimated that 6,800 new 
anal cancer cases occur each year, among which about 75-80% are attributable to HPV types 16 and 
18. Anal cancer is considered a serious condition, and therefore, the preventive effect of qHPV vaccines 
is considered to be of high importance. For women, the inclusion of prevention of anal cancer to the 
indication is unlikely to change the use of qHPV vaccines either at a population or individual level, 
considering the already approved indication for protection against cervical malignancies. However, for 
men, the inclusion of prevention of anal cancer could be more important, as the only other benefit of 
qHPV vaccines is protection against genital warts.  
The data assessed in this and in previous procedures demonstrate that the vaccine is efficacious 
against anal cancer and premalignant anal lesions across all severity grades of AIN in all populations 
studied. In addition, a post-hoc analysis in HPV naïve MSM showed high efficacy against anal persistent 
infection due to HPV 16 and 18. Extrapolation of data from anal disease in MSM to anal HPV infection 
and related disease in heterosexual men and women is acceptable. In the studies presented in the 
current variation for the first time, the duration of protection has been followed for up to 7 years 
showing no sign of waning protection against the more common outcomes. 
The safety profile of qHPV vaccines is considered acceptable with regard to the achievable benefits in 
men and women. The safety profile is likely to be similar in boys/men vs. girls/women. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit risk balance is considered positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
During the previous assessment of the anal cancer indication there were mainly four limitations in the 
data provided: 
1)  there was uncertainty on the long-term duration of protection induced by qHPV vaccine,  
2)  there was uncertainty on qHPV vaccine safety in terms of rare conditions,  
3)  there was absence of post-marketing safety data in males,  
4)  the incidence of anal cancer in the general population was considered to be low and therefore 
the expected benefit was considered to be limited.  
1)  Uncertainty in the long-term duration of protection 
The follow-up of effectiveness against AIN in men in the extension of study 020, and other clinical 
endpoints in men and women in the extension studies 015 and 018 has been extended to up to 8 
years. At the time of the previous assessment the immunogenicity follow- up was up to 5 years and 
effectiveness data were available up to nearly 4 years. There is currently no indication on waning 
efficacy, and further follow-up is ongoing. Thus, there is greater knowledge regarding duration of 
protection compared to the previous application.  
2)  Uncertainty regarding qHPV vaccine safety in terms of rare conditions 
The post-marketing experience is currently three years longer, and the number of exposed subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176749/2014 
Page 40/42 
  
  
 
has increased. There were 10 million estimated subjects exposed in the most recent PSUR with a 
reporting period between 1 June 2012 and 31 May 2013; this represents almost 25% of the cumulative 
exposure of 42 million subjects since marketing authorisation. In addition, safety follow-up is included 
in the ongoing extension studies, post-authorisation safety surveillance and registry-based studies are 
now available. In conclusion, the risks of rare conditions are considered very small, and no consistent 
increased risk has been identified. Compared to the previous application the uncertainty regarding 
unknown risks is considered smaller based on the additional safety data. 
3)  Absence of post-marketing data in males 
More post-marketing data in males became available compared to that from the previous application. 
However, it is not possible to estimate how many doses have been given to males globally. The post-
marketing safety data available includes results from the first interim report P070, and an analysis of 
post-marketing spontaneous adverse event reports in males.  
4)  The incidence of anal cancer in the general population was considered to be low 
There is no reason to believe that the incidence of anal cancer in the general population has changed 
since the previous assessment. The overall risk is considered low, but not non-existent. There is also 
uncertainty regarding future developments, i.e. increasing incidence over time.  
Thus, the overall amount of follow-up data, both with respect to duration of protection and safety, has 
increased since the previous application, and the data obtained so far are reassuring. Efficacy was 
considered demonstrated, and there is currently no indication of waning efficacy, or need for further 
booster doses. The post-marketing experience has increased substantially, and the risks of rare serious 
unknown events are considered very small. Therefore the opinion of the CHMP is that the benefit/risk 
balance for Gardasil and Silgard in the newly proposed indication is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Appendix to CHMP opinion  
DIVERGENT POSITION EXPRESSED BY CHMP MEMBERS  
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the granting 
the extension of the indication for Gardasil/Silgard:  
“Gardasil/Silgard is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of: 
–  premalignant  genital 
lesions 
(cervical,  vulvar  and  vaginal),  premalignant  anal 
lesions,  cervical  cancers  and  anal  cancer  causally  related  to  certain  oncogenic  Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) types 
–  genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to specific HPV types.  
See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support this indication. 
The use of Gardasil/Silgard should be in accordance with official recommendations”. 
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
An extension of the indication with premalignant anal lesions and anal cancer is not endorsed. Anal 
cancer is a very uncommon cancer. Women have a higher incidence rate in age groups greater than 50 
years but men dominate in the age ranges between 20 and 50 years old.  In men and women, 
common risk factors are e.g. receptive anal sex, lifetime number of sexual partners and genital warts.  
Taking into consideration that 
• 
• 
at this time, no validated screening algorithm for early detection of premalignant genital/anal 
disease in populations at risk is available, 
the incidence of anal cancer in the overall population is very low,  
the number boys/adolescents prior to sexual debut to be vaccinated to prevent one case of anal 
(pre)malignancy is considered too high, making the yield of population based vaccination most likely 
extremely limited. 
The benefit-risk balance of the proposed variation is considered negative.

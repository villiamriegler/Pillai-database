1. 
INTRODUCTION 
Pioglitazone is a (2,4) thiazolidinedione derivative that is an orally active ligand for the peroxisome 
proliferator  activated  receptor  γ  (PPARγ).    Pioglitazone  is  currently  approved  in  the  EU  as 
monotherapy or in dual oral combination therapy with metformin or a sulphonylurea. 
At  the  time  of  the  original  Marketing  Authorisation,  the  MAH  committed  to  perform  a  study 
investigating the effect of pioglitazone on the total mortality and macrovascular morbidity in high-risk 
patients  with  type  2  diabetes.  Based  on  the  study  results,  the  MAH  applied  to  extend  the  current 
indication  to  the  use  of  pioglitazone  “as  triple  oral  therapy  in  combination  with    metformin  and  a 
sulphonylurea, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy”. 
In addition, the MAH proposed to delete the following statement in section 4.4: “There is no clinical 
experience  with  pioglitazone  in  triple  combination  with  other  oral  antidiabetics”.  Finally,  the  MAH 
proposed  to  update  the  PL  accordingly  and  to  align  the  product  information  with  QRD  template, 
version 7.1. 
2. 
CLINICAL ASPECTS 
The clinical data supporting the proposed extension of indication were collected from a prospective, 
randomised,  double-blind,  multicentre,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  phase  3b  study  in  patients 
with  type  2  diabetes  and  pre-existing  macrovascular  disease  (PROactive  study  or  EC444  study). 
Supportive  literature  data  in  relation  to  the  use  of  triple  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes 
were also provided. 
STUDY EC444 DESIGN 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  pioglitazone  reduces  total  mortality  and 
macrovascular morbidity in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes.  
Study Participants and baseline data  
Among the inclusion criteria were: 
• 
• 
• 
Male or female patients, 35 to 75 years. 
Glycosylated haemoglobin above the upper limit of normal (more than 6.5%). 
Established  macrovascular  disease:  myocardial  infarction  or  stroke  at  least  6  months  before 
entry, percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG at least 6 months before recruitment, acute 
coronary  syndrome  at  least  3  months  before  recruitment  or  objective  evidence  of  coronary 
artery disease or lower limb obstructive arterial disease. 
Exclusion  criteria  included  Type  1  diabetes;  insulin  as  sole  therapy;  myocardial  infarction  (MI), 
stroke, CAPG or PCI in the previous 6 months; NYHA functional score of 2 or more; acute coronary 
syndrome in the previous 3 months.  
Treatments 
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either pioglitazone or placebo in addition to any existing 
therapy (including diet and exercise and antidiabetic agents, antihypertensives, lipid-lowering agents, 
and antithrombotic agents) over a treatment period of 2.5 to 4 years. This was a forced titration study, 
with the objective of maintaining patients on the maximum tolerated dose of study medication. 
All patients in the pioglitazone treatment group began treatment at the 15 mg QD dose and then, based 
on tolerability, the dose was increased stepwise to 30 mg QD at Visit 2 (Month 1), and 45 mg QD at 
2/10

Visit 3 (Month 2). Throughout the treatment period, the dose could have been increased or decreased 
within the range 15 to 45 mg QD as tolerability allowed.  
Patients returned to the clinical site for follow-up visits at Months 1 and 2, and every 2 months for the 
remainder of the first year, and then every 3 months for the remainder of the study.  
STUDY EC444 BASELINE DATA 
In study EC444, approximately one-quarter of all patients (1427 out of the total study population of 
5238  patients)  received  a  combination  of  metformin  and  sulphonylurea  therapy  (but  no  insulin)  at 
study  entry  to  which  pioglitazone  or  placebo  was  added  for  up  to  3.5  years.  This  is  the  cohort  of 
interest for this assessment of the benefit/risk balance of the triple therapy. 
The baseline antidiabetic therapy of patients is summarised in table I.

(a)  the  baseline  Ns  exclude  those  patients  on  a  fixed-dose  combination  tablet  of  metformin  and 
sulphonylurea. 
Patients in the metformin plus sulphonylurea cohort were receiving mean daily doses of metformin of 
approximately 1700 mg, which is greater than 50% of the maximum recommended dose. At baseline, 
most patients (~90%) were receiving glibenclamide, gliclazide, or glimepiride. Approximately 8% of 
patients  within  the  cohort  were  receiving  an  additional  non-thiazolidinedione  oral  agent,  most 
commonly acarbose. The treatment groups were generally similar with respect to baseline antidiabetic 
therapy.  
The  mean  age  was  62  years,  approximately  two  thirds  of  patients  were  male,  and  the  nearly  entire 
cohort was Caucasian. The mean duration of disease within the cohort was approximately 9.5 years, 
virtually  the  same  as  for  the  total  study  population.  Overall,  baseline  demographic  parameters  were 
similar between treatment groups within the cohort and to the total study population. 
Similar to the total population, nearly half of the patients in the metformin plus sulphonylurea cohort 
had  a  qualifying  event  of  MI  and  nearly  one-fifth  a  qualifying  event  of  a  stroke.  Almost  half  of 
patients fulfilled 2 or more qualifying entry criteria. A higher proportion of patients (between 3% and 
5% treatment-group differential) in the pioglitazone group than in the placebo group had a history of 
MI, angina pectoris, confirmed coronary artery disease, and PCI, whereas similar rates for a history of 
hypertension  and  ACS  were  noted  between  treatment  groups.  The  proportion  of  patients  within  this 
cohort  receiving  specific  cardiovascular  medications  was  generally  similar  to  that  observed  for  the 
total study population.

At the end of the study, approximately 62% of pioglitazone and 55% of placebo patients remained on 
the metformin plus sulphonylurea therapy. In the pioglitazone group, approximately 14% of patients 
dropped  either  metformin  or  sulphonylurea  compared  to  7%  of  placebo-treated  patients.  Fewer 
pioglitazone  patients  had  metformin  plus  sulphonylurea  replaced  with  insulin  (5.2%  vs  8.4%  with 
placebo). Fewer patients in the pioglitazone group had insulin added to their regimen with or without 
dropping either metformin or sulphonylurea compared to patients in the placebo group (approximately 
10% vs 21%). Within the cohort, nearly equal proportion of patients in either treatment group stopped 
metformin  use  (approximately  13%),  whereas  fewer  pioglitazone  patients  compared  to  placebo 
patients stopped sulphonylurea treatment (18% vs 25%).

• 
Effect on lipid parameters 
The benefit observed with pioglitazone used as monotherapy and in dual combination therapies on the 
abnormalities  of  diabetic  dyslipidemia  is  retrieved  in  triple  combination  therapy.  The  percent 
decreases  from  baseline  in  triglycerides  levels  (-15%.  vs.  8.9%)  and  increases  in  HDL-cholesterol 
(21.6% vs. 13.1%) with pioglitazone were statistically significantly greater than the changes seen in 
these  values  with  placebo  respectively.  Both  treatment  groups  had  increases  in  LDL-cholesterol 
(11.8% vs. 6.6%), however, there was a statistically significant decrease in the LDL-cholesterol/HDL-
cholesterol ratio with pioglitazone but not with placebo (-5.1% vs. –2.7%).  
STUDY EC444 SAFETY RESULTS 
EC444  enrolled  more  than  5200  patients  with  long-standing  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  significant 
underlying  cardiovascular  disease.  As  such,  this  patient  population  was  at  high  risk  for  recurrent 
cardiovascular events. More than half of the patients within the cohort had a history of pectoris angina 
and hypertension, while almost half had a history of confirmed ACS and MI.

Serious adverse events (SAEs) and fatal adverse events 
The common SAEs for the cohort of patients receiving metformin plus sulphonylurea at baseline are 
summarised in table V. The most frequently reported SAEs included MI, angina pectoris and cardiac 
failure. Incidences of the remaining SAEs were generally similar between treatment groups. However, 
SAEs  of  cardiac  failure,  cardiac  failure  congestive,  and  pneumonia  occurred  more  frequently  in  the 
pioglitazone  group,  whereas  hypertension  and  hypertensive  crisis  occurred  more  frequently  in  the 
placebo group.

Fatal SAEs occurring in the cohort of patients of interest are summarised in table VI. In comparison to 
the overall cohort, in which 6.8% in pioglitazone and 7.1% in placebo groups died, the proportion of 
patients  with  fatal  SAEs  is  slightly  lower  in  the  metformin  plus  sulphonylurea  group  with  5.9%  vs. 
6.6%  for  pioglitazone  and  placebo,  respectively.  The  most  common  causes  of  death  were  cardiac 
disorders, and the overall incidence was similar between treatment groups. Slightly fewer patients in 
the pioglitazone group than in the placebo group died from MI or sudden death. Fatal MI and cardiac 
failure  occurred  in  proportionally  fewer  patients  in  the  metformin  plus  sulphonylurea  cohort  as 
compared to the total study population.

Adverse  events  of  hypoglcaemia,  oedema,  and  serious  heart  failure  were  considered  AEs  of  special 
interest  in  EC444.  As  such,  they  were  both  reported  spontaneously  by  the  patient  and  specifically 
solicited  by  the  investigator.  These  AEs  of  special  interest  were  reported  more  frequently  with 
pioglitazone than placebo, but the relative risk of each of these events was no different in the cohort 
metformin plus sulphonylurea to that observed in the total study population (Table VII, VIII and IX).

Laboratory and other safety findings  
Hepatic and renal functions 
The EC444 study report contains a complete description of the results of laboratory evaluations in the 
overall study population. No subgroup analyses of laboratory results were done for the population of 
patients taking metformin plus sulphonylurea combination therapy. 
In the overall study population, no deleterious effects on liver function were seen with pioglitazone. 
Incidences of high ALT, AST, or alkaline phosphatase values were low in both groups, and very few 
patients in either group had elevations to 3 times the ULN in either variable. Compared with placebo, 
pioglitazone patients showed a trend toward normalisation of high liver function values from baseline 
to the Final Visit. 
The effects on renal function, as assessed through creatinine measurements, were not distinguishable 
between pioglitazone and placebo in this study. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations  
The  EC444  study  report  contains  a  complete  description  of  the  results  of  vital  sign  evaluations  and 
measurements  of  weight  in  the  overall  study  population.  Again,  no  subgroup  analyses  of  the  results 
were done for the population of patients taking metformin plus sulphonylurea combination therapy. In 
the overall study population, small but consistent decreases were observed from baseline to the final 
visit  in  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  decreases  were  slightly 
greater for pioglitazone than for placebo. Patients in the pioglitazone group gained a mean of 3.8 kg 
over the 30 months of the study, compared with a mean loss of 0.6 kg for placebo. Most of the weight 
gain with pioglitazone took place in approximately the first 15 months of the study. 
Drug interaction 
There  was  no  new  drug  interaction  data  derived  from  the  analysis  of  pioglitazone  in  oral  triple 
combination therapy. A large number of concomitant medications were given to patients taking part in 
the clinical trials. No individual drugs or classes of drugs were identified to have any influence on the 
reported safety profile, and no interactions were reported. 
Post marketing surveillance 
Cumulative  exposure  to  pioglitazone  is  estimated  to  be  approximately  3,419,000  patient-years  of 
treatment  in  the  US,  1,175,000  patient-years  in  Japan  and  648,000  patient-years  in  Europe.  In  other 
areas  (Canada,  South  America,  African  continent,  Asian  countries,  etc.),  where  patient  exposure  is 
estimated,  pioglitazone  has  been  prescribed  to  around  107,000  patients  during  this  period  (226,000 
patient-years). 
The MAH provided an overview of the seven last periodic safety update reports (PSURs). The profile 
of  adverse  drug  reaction  reports  in  all  seven  PSURs  was  consistently  similar  to  that  seen  in  earlier 
postmarketing reviews and in clinical trials conducted with pioglitazone; thus confirming the known 
safety profile of pioglitazone.

Reference was also made to an observational study performed on UK-based GPRD (Koro et al) where 
21,888 type 2 diabetic patients were identified and a 6:1 nested case-control design was used (1,301 
incident  CHF  cases  were  identified  in  the  cohort  matched  to  7,788  controls).  After  risk  factor 
adjustment,  there  was  a  1.2  fold  increase  in  the  risk  of  CHF  for  sulphonylureas  and  metformin 
monotherapies,  a  1.6-fold  increase  with  combination  of  metformin  and  sulphonylureas,  a  2.2-fold 
increase for tri-combinations and a 1.5-fold increase for insulin compared to no exposure. Compared 
to sulphonylureas, bicombinations of metformin and sulphonylureas showed a statistically significant 
1.4-fold increase in odds of CHF. The conclusion drawn was that the risk of CHF increased with the 
complexity of antidiabetic regimen, suggesting that it is diabetes severity which imparts the risk and 
not necessarily the antidiabetic regimen itself. 
Pharmacovigilance 
Description of the Pharmacovigilance System 
The MAH submitted a description of their Pharmacovigilance System.  
Risk management plan 
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH submitted a risk management plan (RMP). This RMP covers 
this  extension  of  indication  as  well  as  two  other  ongoing  ones,  EMEA/H/C/268/II/23  (first  line 
therapy) and EMEA/H/C/268/II/25 (insulin combination indication).  
Please find below a table summarising the RMP concerning the present triple oral therapy indication. 
Safety concern  Proposed pharmacovigilance activities 
Oedema and

SPC 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required for this particular triple oral therapy extension of 
indication  beyond  those  included  in  the  product  information.  However,  any  concerns  that  may  arise 
from the assessment of the two other ongoing extensions of indication will be addressed in the relevant 
procedures.

OVERALL CONCLUSIONS AND BENEFIT/RISK ASSESSMENT 
Glycaemic  control  was  improved  with  the  addition  of  pioglitazone  to  metformin  and  sulphonylurea.  
The maximum mean decrease in HbA1c was observed at the Month 12 visit, after which it remained 
stable  until  the  final  visit.  At  all  time  points,  the  mean  decrease  in  HbA1c  was  statistically 
significantly greater with pioglitazone compared to placebo with a treatment difference in HbA1c of 
0.59% at the final visit (-0.94% versus -0.35%, P<0.0001). Fourteen percent of patients did not require 
or  dropped  either  Metformin  or  Sulphonylurea  compared  to  7%  of  placebo-treated  patients.  Fewer 
patients taking pioglitazone progressed to insulin compared with placebo. While an increase in LDL 
cholesterol with pioglitazone compared to placebo was observed, HDL cholesterol also increased, and 
the LDL/HDL ratio remained favourable for pioglitazone use.  
The mean metformin daily dose at baseline in both treatment groups exceeded 80% of the maximum 
recommended daily dose of 2000 mg. The mean daily metformin dose at final visit increased by only 
213 mg in the placebo group. For glibenclamide, the mean daily dose at baseline exceeded 75% of the 
maximum  recommended  daily  dose  of  15  mg,  and  there  was  no  increase  in  the  mean  daily

glibenclamide dose at final visit. The absence of substantial increases in metformin or sulphonylurea 
and  lower  proportion  of  patients  requiring  initiation  of  insulin  during  the  study  in  the  pioglitazone 
group  suggest  that  the  patients  in  the  metformin  plus  sulphonylurea  cohort  had  used  the  maximum 
tolerated dose of the dual therapy before being given pioglitazone.  
The  administration  of  pioglitazone  was  generally  safe  and  well  tolerated  in  these  high-risk  patients 
who  were  receiving  metformin  plus  sulphonylurea  at  study  entry  who  then  received  pioglitazone. 
Higher rates of oedema and heart failure were reported with pioglitazone than with placebo but there is 
no  evidence  of  increased  mortality  with  long-term  pioglitazone  treatment.  Recent  estimates  of  heart 
failure rates in type 2 diabetes over a 6-year observation period were as high as 31 per 1,000 person-
years  compared  to  a  rate  of  12  amongst  non-diabetic  populations  (rate  ratio  2.5;  95%  CI:  2.3,2.7). 
Koro et al (UK based GPRD) concluded from an observational study that the risk of congestive heart 
failure  increased  with  the  complexity  of  antidiabetic  regimen,  suggesting  that  it  is  the  severity  of 
diabetes that imparts the risk and not necessarily the antidiabetic regimen itself. Thus, the incidence of 
serious  heart  failure  reported  in  EC444  in  the  overall  population,  as  well  as  in  the  metformin  plus 
sulphonylurea cohort, is within the expected range for patients with type 2 diabetes. Treatment with 
thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone, in patients who are at risk for development of heart failure, 
should be initiated at the lowest available dose and the dose increased gradually.  
A higher rate of hypoglycaemia was reported with pioglitazone than with placebo. This might require 
a reduction of the dose of the sulphonylurea in patients receiving a triple oral therapy and this has been 
reflected adequately in the SPC.  
As requested by the CHMP, a subgroup analysis of all adverse events by the intrinsic factors gender, 
age,  and  body  mass  index  was  performed  on  the  cohort  of  patients  receiving  metformin  and 
sulphonylurea treatment but no insulin at baseline. Overall, the subgroup analysis conducted did not 
reveal  an  increased  risk  of  adverse  events  in  relation  to  gender,  age,  body  mass  index  with  triple 
therapy use. 
Based on the safety and efficacy data provided, the CHMP recommended the extension of indication 
of  Actos  to  the  use  of  pioglitazone  as  triple  oral  therapy  in  combination  with  metformin  and  a 
sulphonylurea,  in  patients  (particularly  overweight  patients)  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control 
despite  dual  oral  therapy.  Sections  4.1,  4.4  and  4.8  of  the  SPC  as  well  as  the  PL  were  revised 
accordingly.

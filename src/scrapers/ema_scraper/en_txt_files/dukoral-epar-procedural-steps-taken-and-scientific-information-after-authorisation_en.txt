1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are 
issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD 
is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

campaign in Zanzibar. The Product Information has been 
updated to reflect these data, as well as the possibility to use 
chlorinated water to prepare the buffer solution .

SmPC, 
These variations concerns an introduction of an increase of 
Dukoral batches will be formulated using a higher 
content of bacteria, 125x109 compared to 100x109 
bacteria per vaccine dose. The antigen content stays 
within the approved range which has proved 
efficacious and safe in a large number of clinical trials 
conducted with Dukoral and the dosage is not 
affected. The reason for this change is to give a 
greater assurance that the product fully meets the 
potency requirements over the entire shelf life. As a 
consequence of this recalibration the Product 
Information (SmPC, Labelling and PL) has been 
updated accordingly to reflect the change in the 
bacterial content prior to inactivation. 
B.II.b.3.e - Change in the manufacturing process of 
the finished product - Introduction or increase in the 
Labelling and 
25% of the bacterial content (as measured before 
PL 
inactivation) in the manufacture of the finished product and 
correction of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) limits at release 
and during shelf life of the finished product due to 
reassignment of the LPS content (O1-LPS inhibition ELISA) in 
a new standard preparation. Dukoral batches will be 
formulated using a higher content of bacteria, 125x109 
compared to 100x109 bacteria per vaccine dose. The antigen 
content stays within the approved range which has proved 
efficacious and safe in a large number of clinical trials 
conducted with Dukoral and the dosage is not affected. The 
reason for this change is to give a greater assurance that the 
product fully meets the potency requirements over the entire 
shelf life. As a consequence of this recalibration the Product

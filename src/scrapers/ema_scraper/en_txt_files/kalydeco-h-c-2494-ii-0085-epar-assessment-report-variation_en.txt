A marketing authorisation application (MAA) for a fixed dose combination (FDC) film-coated tablet of 
elexacaftor (VX-445) 100 mg/tezacaftor (VX-661) 50 mg/ivacaftor (VX-770) 75 mg 
(EMEA/H/C/005269) has received positive opinion from the CHMP, in June 2020, for the treatment of 
cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation 
in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for the 
F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation. 
This type II variation application has been submitted to include the use of Kalydeco in combination 
with Kaftrio. Of note, this application was submitted before the approval of Kaftrio, thus, the initially 
proposed indication for Kalydeco in association with Kaftrio does not correspond to the agreed 
indication of Kaftrio.  
The daily dosing regimen consists of oral administration of 2 elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC 
tablets in the morning and 1 ivacaftor (150 mg) tablet (Kalydeco) in the evening. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR 
gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR 
protein is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 7/108 
 
 
 
absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs results in the 
multisystem pathology associated with CF.  
In people with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein result in the 
accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, 
impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. 
Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF.  
The biochemical defect of defective chloride channel function is present from birth, with the sequelae 
of lung, pancreatic and other organ involvement emerging progressively throughout childhood and into 
adulthood.  
F508del is the most common disease-causing mutation, and the vast majority of CF patients (~84.7% 
in the US and ~81.1% in Europe) have this mutation on at least 1 allele. 
Epidemiology  
CF affects approximately a total of 31,000 individuals in the US and a total of 42.000 in the EU 
(excluding the data from Russia, Turkey and Israel)1,2. The incidence and prevalence of CF varies 
between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the Caucasian populations of North 
America and Europe than in Asian and African populations. In Europe, the median age of all CF 
patients is 18.5 years (with youngest patient being diagnosed just after birth and the oldest patients 
being 88.4 years of age). Despite advances in treatment, the current median age of death in a patient 
with CF was approximately 31 years in 2018, and the future predicted median age of survival is 
approximately 47 years1,2. 
Biologic features 
CF is an autosomal recessive disease in which disease-causing mutations are present on both CFTR 
alleles that make up a patient’s genotype. Severity of CF is determined by the extent of the loss of 
CFTR-mediated chloride transport caused by the 2 CFTR mutant alleles. Historically, these CFTR 
mutations have been categorized in different ways including a class system based on their effect on 
CFTR protein synthesis or function (Classes I through VI) and grouping based on phenotypic 
expression (e.g., residual CFTR function). To study the impact of CFTR modulators, Vertex has 
categorized mutations as follows: gating (G), residual function (RF), and minimal function (MF). 
Patients with CF who have 2 alleles that result in complete or near complete loss of CFTR-mediated 
chloride transport (e.g., F508del, Class I mutations which make no CFTR protein, gating mutations 
such as G551D) demonstrate severe CF characterized by early onset and relatively rapid disease 
progression, with sweat chloride concentrations (an in vivo marker of CFTR function) typically greater 
than 90 mmol/L. For patients with residual function mutations or those who are partially treated by 
existing CFTR modulator therapy, further increases in CFTR-mediated chloride transport are expected 
to be associated with further normalization of physiology and disease consequences. 
Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
CFTR is an ion channel that regulates the flow of chloride and other ions across epithelia in various 
tissues, including the lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands. Decreased 
CFTR quantity or function results in the failure to regulate chloride transport in these tissues leading to 
the multisystem pathology associated with CF. Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of 
mortality. The clinical manifestations are those of progressive airway obstruction and bronchiectasis, 
Assessment report

Page 8/108 
 
 
 
with periods of worsening pulmonary symptoms associated with a decline in pulmonary function and 
increased bacterial density in airway secretions (pulmonary exacerbations). Obstruction of airways with 
thick mucus, establishment of a chronic bacterial infection in the airways, and damaging inflammatory 
responses are all thought to play a role in causing irreversible structural changes in the lungs, leading 
to respiratory failure. In addition, poor growth and nutritional status have historically been common in 
patients with CF owing to a number of factors, including pancreatic insufficiency-related fat 
malabsorption, increased energy expenditure attributable to progressive lung disease, appetite 
suppression attributable to chronic infection, and CF-related diabetes. 
Management 
The approved CFTR modulators (IVA, LUM/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) were developed in specific subsets of CF 
patients, grouped by specific CFTR mutations and genotypes that were responsive to each of the 
modulators. This approach led to the approval of CFTR modulator regimens based on multiple 
individual mutations and genotypes: e.g., gating mutations, residual function mutations, patients 
homozygous for F508del (Table 1). 
Table 1 Indications for CFTR Approved Modulators in the EU 
Kaftrio is a triple combination product which contains the new CFTR modulator elexacaftor (VX-445), 
and the known CFTR modulators ivacaftor and tezacaftor; Kaftrio received a positive opinion from 
CHMP in July 2020.  
2.1.2.  About the product

Kaftrio, a fixed dose combination (FDC) film-coated tablet of elexacaftor (VX-445) 100 mg/tezacaftor 
(VX-661) 50 mg/ivacaftor (VX-770) 75 mg (EMEA/H/C/005269) received positive opinion from the 
CHMP in July 2020 for the following indication: 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 9/108 
 
 
 
 
“Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the 
CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation (see section 5.1).”  
This extension of application is submitted to include the use in combination with Kaftrio as per the 
following approved posology:  
-  Morning dose: 2 fixed-dose combinations (FDC) tablets of Kaftrio (each containing elexacaftor 
100 mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg).  
- 
Evening dose: 1 tablet containing 150 mg of Kalydeco (ivacaftor).  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The VX-445/TEZ/IVA development program consisted of 10 clinical studies, including a Phase 3 
program enrolling over 500 CF subjects providing approximately 330 patient-years of exposure. 
In January 2018, Vertex received Scientific Advice from the CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/9006/2018) on 
the proposed clinical development programme for Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor.  
The Protocol Assistance pertained to the following clinical aspects: 
•  Adequacy of the proposed clinical development plan to support an initial marketing authorisation 
application (MAA) for Kaftrio in CF patients aged 12 and older heterozygous for the F508del 
mutation and a “MF” mutation, including a single 24-week pivotal randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in approximately 360 F/MF subjects with the primary endpoint 
absolute change in ppFEV1 at Week 4. The study would also assess the effect on pulmonary 
exacerbation rate. Specific questions were raised on the use of an interim analysis of the 4-week 
primary endpoint to support the MAA submission, and the proposed safety database. 
•  Acceptability of the proposed clinical development plan to support indication to patients with CF 
aged 12 years and older who have the F508del mutation on at least 1 allele, including a 
randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled (TEZ/IVA), 4-week Phase 3 study in CF 
subjects, aged 12 years and older, with the F/F genotype with the primary endpoint absolute 
change in ppFEV1 at Week 4. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for the combined use of ivacaftor (as an evening dose) with Kaftrio.  
The MAH provided non-clinical studies conducted to support the approval of Kaftrio. Since Kalydeco is 
already authorised and its non-clinical profile is known, the main part of the information in this section 
refers to the relevant results on the use of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio. 
Elexacaftor (VX-445), a component of the fixed-dose combination Kaftrio, is a novel CFTR corrector that 
has both a different chemical structure and a different mechanism of action from first-generation CFTR 
correctors, like tezacaftor. 
No  additional  non-clinical  data  are  submitted  for  this  extension  of  indication  for  Kalydeco.  This  is 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020

considered acceptable. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
There  is  no  validated  animal  model  for  CF  that  fully  mimics  the  human  multi  organ  affected  disease. 
Furthermore, the proposed treatment is specific for mutated CFTR proteins.  
CFTR modulators are small molecules that target specific defects caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. 
Correctors  (tezacaftor  and  lumacaftor)  facilitate  the  cellular  processing  and  trafficking  of  CFTR  to 
increase  the  quantity  of  CFTR  at  the  cell  surface.  Potentiators  (ivacaftor)  increase  the  channel  open 
probability (channel gating activity) of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface to enhance chloride 
transport. A combination of a corrector and a potentiator, should results in sufficient levels of CFTR at 
the surface, which is then enhanced for its gating function. A summary of selected pharmacodynamic 
studies of the different modulators, based on the Kaftrio application is provided below. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Binding of elexacaftor and tezacaftor to CFTR protein was measured using thermostabilized CFTR (TS-
CFTR)  reconstituted  into  nanodiscs.  The  results  show  that  both  molecules  bind  to  different,  non-
competing binding sites on TS-CFTR. Elexacaftor binds to both MSD1 and MSD2, which is different to 
tezacaftor, which binds to MSD1 only. 
The MAH used two groups of HBE cells to study the effect of elexacaftor on top of tezacaftor and or 
ivacaftor on the processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR. One group consisted of HBE cells from 
three different donors all harbouring two F508del alleles (F/F group). The other group consisted of HBE 
cells from four donors, all harbouring one F508del allele and one allele with a minimal function (MF) 
mutation (F/MF group). Among these four F/MF donors; two donors harbour a G542X mutation, one 
donor harbours a 3905insT mutation and one donor harbours an E585X mutation.  
The results showed that elexacaftor incubation of the cells results in an increase of glycosylated CFTR 
compared to untreated, tezacaftor treated and ivacaftor treated cells. Treatment with tezacaftor and 
elexacaftor resulted in a synergistic effect. This effect seems to be dampened by the co-incubation with 
ivacaftor, but the potentiator ivacaftor is very likely needed to improve the function of the channels 
that have reached the membrane. Overall, the incubation with the combination of the three active 
compounds resulted in a higher increase in glycosylated mutant CFTR as compared to incubation with 
one corrector and one potentiator, thus with tezacaftor and ivacaftor or elexacaftor and ivacaftor.  
In  addition  to the effect  on  the  processing,  the effect  on  chloride transport of  elexacaftor  alone or  in 
combination  with  tezacaftor  and  or  ivacaftor  was  tested  in  F/F  HBE  cells  or  F/MF  HBE  cells  by  Using 
chamber  electrophysiology.  The  results  of  this  chloride  transport  assay  showed  better  results  for  the 
triple combination. In addition, the effect of VX-445 alone and in combination with tezacaftor, with and 
without  ivacaftor,  on  channel  gating  activity  was  determined  using  patch  clamp  experiments.  After 
spiking  with  the  corrector(s)  alone,  channel  opening  was  only  very  minimal.  After  spiking  with  the 
corrector(s) and the potentiator channel opening was achieved efficiently, supporting the use of ivacaftor 
in the triple combination. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The secondary pharmacodynamics of tezacaftor, ivacaftor, and M6-IVA (a major metabolite of ivacaftor) 
were previously established in the support of the registration of Kalydeco, Orkambi, and Symkevi. These 
data showed that these tezacaftor, ivacaftor, and M6-IVA had a low propensity to elicit off-target effects

at therapeutic exposures. In addition, elexacaftor seems to be selective for CFTR, and have minimal off 
target effects.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  dedicated  pharmacodynamics  drug  interaction  studies  were  submitted.  The  pharmacodynamic 
interaction  of  the  elexacaftor,  tezacaftor  and  ivacaftor  was  assessed  in  the  in  vitro  primary 
pharmacodynamic studies. Ivacaftor may interfere slightly with the increase of mature CFTR levels due 
to  tezacaftor  and  elexacaftor  incubation,  however  this  would  have  minimal  impact  and  is  acceptable 
considering the need to add ivacaftor in order to open the chloride channels. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Results from the conventional studies on safety pharmacology suggested a low potential for elexacaftor, 
tezacaftor  or  ivacaftor  to  elicit  effects  on  CNS,  respiratory  or  cardiovascular  parameters  at  clinically 
relevant exposures. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of VX-445 were investigated in a series of in vitro and in vivo 
studies as part of Kaftrio application. The PK properties of tezacaftor, ivacaftor and the combination 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor were previously assessed in the registration programs for Symkevi and Kalydeco. 
No additional PK data for Kalydeco are available which is considered acceptable for this application. No 
dedicated non-clinical PK DDI studies have been submitted. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
An  extensive  non-clinical  package  was  submitted  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  VX-445  as  part  of  Kaftrio 
application. No additional toxicology data on the use of Kalydeco with Kaftrio were submitted. This was 
considered acceptable by CHMP.  
Combination repeat-dose toxicity studies to assess the potential for additive and/or synergistic toxicity 
did not produce any unexpected toxicities or interactions. The potential for synergistic toxicity on male 
reproduction has not been assessed.

Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020

Based  on  the  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application,  the  extended  indication  does  not  lead  to  a 
significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of ivacaftor.  
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
This type II variation is submitted to include the combination of ivacaftor with Kaftrio.  
Pharmacological studies performed for the Kaftrio non-clinical application showed that VX-445 and TEZ 
bind to CFTR simultaneously at different binding sites.  
Furthermore, VX-445 incubation of the cells resulted in an increase of glycosylated CFTR compared to 
non-treated, TEZ treated and IVA treated cells. Treatment with TEZ and VX-445 resulted in a synergistic 
additive effect on mature fraction of CTFR. However, the effect was reduced by the addition of IVA. Upon 
request by CHMP, the MAH clarified that the mechanism causing the small reduction in mature CFTR by 
IVA  is  not  known.  According  to  Veit  et  al.,  a  plausible  explanation  would  be  that  IVA  interacts  with 
F508del-CFTR to cause conformational destabilization. Veit et al., suggest that “the negative effect of 
VX-770 (IVA) would be more pronounced in patients having a single copy of F508del-CFTR”, which is 
not consistent with the MAH observations. Therefore, even with the small reduction in mature CFTR, IVA 
is  required  to  restore  the  defective  channel  gating  activity  of  the  F508del-CFTR  delivered  to  the  cell 
surface by VX-445/TEZ.  
Ivacaftor is associated with a decrease of overall fertility index and number of pregnancies in females; 
and the VX-445 component of Kaftrio with reduced fertility and male reproductive organs toxicity. Thus, 
the potential for synergistic toxicity on male reproduction cannot be ruled out.  
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the non-clinical package submitted for Kaftrio and on the already known non-clinical profile of 
Kalydeco, the use of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio is considered acceptable from a non-clinical 
point of view.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of Kalydeco is adequately characterised since authorisation. Within this application the 
documentation submitted was the PK data package submitted for Kaftrio application, which was 
considered adequate.  
No additional data are needed to support this application for combination regimen with Kaftrio. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of Kalydeco and Kaftrio has been adequately characterised. No new data are 
required in support of this application.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of IVA and IVA/TEZ/VX-445 has been adequately investigated. 
Nevertheless, regarding the dose advice for CF patients with hepatic impairment, although it appears 
reasonable and can at this stage be accepted for those patients with moderate hepatic impairment, no 
information has been provided by the MAH on the effect of the proposed dose-reduction on the 
exposure to the active metabolite M1-TEZ. The MAH has committed to provide such analysis and 
subsequently re-discuss/refine the dose-advice in moderate hepatically impaired patients. This 
discussion will be provided at the time that the CSR from Study 007 is submitted as post-approval 
commitment for Kaftrio.  
The agreed posology by CHMP for the use of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio has been correctly 
reflected in the SmPC. 
No additional data are required in support of this application.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, VX-445, as well as tezacaftor and ivacaftor pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have 
been adequately investigated and correctly reflected in the SmPC.  
To support the dose advice in patients with hepatic impairment, the MAH committed to submit the final 
clinical study report of study 007 as a post-approval commitment for Kaftrio by end of Q3 2020. The 
MAH is also expected to re-discuss/re fine the dose-advice in moderately hepatic impaired patients, 
taking into account the expected exposure of the active M1-TEZ metabolite. This information is 
important in support of the dose advice in patients with hepatic impairment. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
A clinical program for Kaftrio Iniital Marketing Authorisation was designed to assess whether the 
presence of a single F508del allele would be sufficient for CF patients to benefit from the TC regimen.  
The core efficacy data are from 2 controlled Phase 3 studies: 
•  Study 102: a 24-week study in subjects with a single F508del allele (F/MF) 
•  Study 103: a 4-week study in subjects with two F508del alleles (F/F) 
Supportive efficacy data are from: 
• 
Phase 1/2 Study 001 in F/MF (Part D) and F/F subjects (Part E) 
•  Study 105, an ongoing open-label extension (OLE) study evaluating long-term safety and 
efficacy for 96 weeks in subjects who participated in Studies 102 and 103.  
Additionally, results of a cross study comparison using data from Studies 103 and 105 and Phase 3 
studies of TEZ/IVA (Symkevi) which was requested by European Medicines Agency Paediatric 
Committee (PDCO) provide supportive efficacy data. This comparison is also referred to as the Meta-
analysis (paediatric investigation plan [PIP] Study C9). 
Treatments 
Kalydeco was administered as an evening dose in combination with Kaftrio for the phase 3 clinical 
studies and its extension which is acceptable. 
The treatment regimens used in the Phase 3 studies are summarized in Table 3.

2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Data provided by the MAH was identical to the data package submitted within Kaftrio application. 
These data supported dose responses related to the mono-components of the fixed-dose combination 
of Kaftrio and are not described in this procedure. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
Two main studies were presented within Kaftrio application and have therefore been considered for this 
application:  
Study VX17-445-102:  
A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of VX-445 
Combination Therapy in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Who Are Heterozygous for the F508del Mutation 
and a Minimal Function Mutation (F/MF). 
Study VX17-445-103: 
A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of VX-445 
Combination Therapy in Subjects with Cystic Fibrosis Who Are Homozygous for the F508del Mutation 
(F/F).  
Methods 
Study 102 
Subjects with F/MF genotypes were randomized (1:1) to either VX-445/TEZ/IVA or placebo (Figure 1). 
Randomization was stratified by percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) 
determined during the Screening Period (<70 versus ≥70), age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 
years of age), and sex (male versus female). 
Figure 1 Schematic of Study Design for Study 102 
Study 103 
After a 4-week TEZ/IVA Run-in Period to establish an on-treatment (TEZ/IVA) baseline for comparison 
with the Treatment Period, subjects with the F/F genotype were randomized (1:1) to either VX-
445/TEZ/IVA or TEZ/IVA (Figure 2). Randomization was stratified by ppFEV1 determined during the 
TEZ/IVA Run-in Period (<70 versus ≥70) and by age (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) at screening.

Figure 2 Schematic of Study Design for Study 103 
Study participants 
The key inclusion criteria were in both studies, aged 12 years and older, FEV1 value ≥40% and ≤90% 
of predicted mean for age, sex, and height, a confirmed diagnosis of CF by the investigator and stable 
CF disease as judged by the investigator. 
Study 102 included patients heterozygous for F508del and an MF mutation (F/MF). The eligible MF 
mutations were pre-specified (see Table 8). Previous clinical studies of TEZ/IVA and LUM/IVA in F/MF 
patients have failed to demonstrate efficacy.  
MF mutations on that list were determined by the MAH to qualify as an MF mutation if meeting one of 
the following 2 criteria:  
(1)  biological plausibility of no translated protein (genetic sequence predicts the complete 
absence of CFTR protein), or 
(2)  in vitro testing that supports lack of responsiveness to TEZ, IVA, or TEZ/IVA, and evidence 
of clinical severity on a population basis (as reported in large patient registries).  
Study 103 included patients homozygous for F508del (F/F). Although currently approved CFTR 
modulator therapies are available for F/F patients, these patients continue to have progressive lung 
disease. 
The main exclusion criteria were similar in both trials, being:  
1.  Any of the following abnormal laboratory values at screening: 
a.  Hemoglobin <10 g/dL 
b.  Total bilirubin ≥2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) 
c.  Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥3 × ULN 
d.  Abnormal renal function defined as glomerular filtration rate ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m2 
(calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Equation) for subjects 
≥18 years of age and ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated by the Counahan-Barratt 
equation) for subjects aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive) 
2.  An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, PEx, or changes in therapy (including antibiotics) 
for sinopulmonary disease within 28 days before the first dose of study drug (Day 1 [Study 
102]), or before the first dose of TEZ/IVA in the Run-in Period (Day -28 [Study 103]).. 
Assessment report

Page 19/108 
 
 
 
 
3.  Lung infection with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status 
(including, but not limited to, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, and 
Mycobacterium abscessus). For subjects who had a history of a positive culture, the 
investigator applied the following criteria to establish whether the subject was free of infection 
with such organisms: 
a.  The subject did not have a respiratory tract culture positive for these organisms within 
the 12 months before the date of informed consent. 
b.  The subject had at least 2 respiratory tract cultures negative for such organisms within 
the 12 months before the date of informed consent, with the first and last of these 
separated by at least 3 months, and the most recent one within the 6 months before 
the date of informed consent. 
Treatments 
The treatment regimens used in the Phase 3 studies are summarized below.

TEZ/IVAa 
The TEZ/IVA dosages for the control group were the same as those used in the TC regimen (the commercial 
doses of TEZ and IVA). 
Study drug was taken within 30 minutes of the start of a fat-containing meal or snack, such as a 
standard “CF” meal or snack or a standard meal. 
For both studies use of any other CFTR modulator therapy for the study duration was not permitted. 
For Study 102 use of CFTR modulators needed to be stopped at least 28 days before the first dose of 
study drug on Day 1. For Study 103 patients taking Vertex CFTR modulators right up to the time of 
screening could be recruited, and they only needed to stop these at the start of the TEZ/IVA run-in 
period. Those on non-Vertex CFTR modulators had to have a wash out period pre-screening.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary and secondary efficacy and pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints evaluated in Studies 102 
and 103 are provided in Table 4. 
In Study 102, the primary endpoint in the global protocol was absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 
at Week 4. Subsequently, European regulators requested a primary endpoint of absolute change from 
baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24, thus a Europe-specific protocol amendment was made to 
accommodate the request. The global protocol was followed in all regions except Europe.

For the F/F population, endpoints that require a longer follow-up than 4 weeks were assessed in the 
open-label extension study 105 (i.e., pulmonary exacerbations [PEx], body mass index [BMI], and 
weight). 
Spirometry was performed according to the internationally-recognized American Thoracic Society 
Guidelines/European Respiratory Society Guidelines.1 
The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) was used to capture and evaluate the impact of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA on patient-reported respiratory symptoms and other aspects of health-related quality of 
life. In children of 12 and 13 years of age (at baseline) the CFQ-R for children was used, and a CFQ-R 
for Parents/Caregivers version. 
PEx was defined as a clinical deterioration in respiratory status necessitating a change in antibiotic 
therapy (intravenous [IV], inhaled, or oral) for any 4 or more of the following signs or symptoms: 
change in sputum; new or increased hemoptysis; increased cough; increased dyspnoea; malaise, 
fatigue, or lethargy; temperature above 38°C (equivalent to approximately 100.4°F); anorexia or 
weight loss; sinus pain or tenderness; change in sinus discharge; change in physical examination of

Sample size 
Study 102 (F/MF) 
Power calculations were based on 180 subjects and a 10% dropout rate in each treatment group at the 
final analysis and 70 subjects and a 5% dropout rate in each group at the IA.  
Study 103 (F/F) 
Power calculations were based on 100 subjects and a 5% dropout rate at Week 4.  
Randomisation 
For Study 102 (F/MF), subjects with F/MF genotypes were randomized (1:1) to either VX 
445/TEZ/IVA or placebo. Randomization was stratified by ppFEV1 determined during the Screening 
Period (<70 versus ≥70), age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and sex (male 
versus female). 
For Study 103 (F/F), subjects with the F/F genotype were randomized (1:1) to either VX 445/TEZ/IVA 
or TEZ/IVA. Randomization was stratified by ppFEV1 determined during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period 
(<70 versus ≥70) and by age (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) at screening. 
Blinding (masking) 
For study 102 (F/MF) and study 103 (F/F), all subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site 
personnel (including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the 
Vertex study team were blinded to the treatment codes until the final database lock, with the following 
main exceptions: 
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject in the 
event of a life-threatening medical emergency or to ensure the safety of the subject and her foetus in 
the event of a pregnancy. 
• For SAE processing and reporting regulations, for preparing the final (production) randomization list 
and for preparing the unblinded analysis for the IDMC. 
• Bioanalytical contract research organization (CRO) analysing PK samples and the Vertex Bioanalytical 
personnel who is not a member of the study team but reviews raw data from the Bioanalytical CRO.  
For study 102 only: 
• Vendor for modelling and simulations performing population PK modelling in preparation for 
regulatory submission(s) 
For the purpose of regulatory submissions in certain regions, a limited Vertex team may be unblinded 
to the IA results. The IA was performed by an external independent biostatistician who was not 
involved in and did not influence study conduct. The analyses generated by the external independent 
biostatistician were reviewed by the IDMC. Only after the IDMC declared that the study had crossed 
the prespecified efficacy boundary was the study unblinded by a limited Vertex team to prepare a 
regulatory submission. Members of the limited Vertex unblinded team will not be involved in or 
influence the conduct of the remaining part of the study to protect the integrity of the study.

Statistical methods 
Models 
In both studies, analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 
was performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). A similar MMRM was used 
for all key secondary endpoints with the exception of the number of PEx (in Study 102) which used a 
negative binomial regression model. For the European Protocol all randomized subjects who carry the 
intended CFTR allele mutations and have received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Control of Overall Type I Error and Testing Hierarchy 
Studies 102 and 103 each included a hierarchical testing procedure to control the type I error rate for 
the multiple key secondary endpoints which were tested at an alpha of 0.05. For a test at any step to 
be considered statistically significant within the testing hierarchy, it must have been statistically 
significant, and all previous tests (if any) within the hierarchy must have been statistically significant 
at the 0.05 level.  
In the global protocol of Study 102, an interim analysis (IA) was planned for the testing of absolute 
change from baseline in ppFEV1 at Week 4. For this, a Lan and DeMets alpha spending function was 
applied such that an alpha of 0.01 was preserved for the final analysis. Because all subjects were 
included in the IA, the information fraction was 100% and thus, the primary endpoint was tested at an 
alpha of 0.05 during the IA. This IA was not relevant to the European protocol because the primary 
endpoint for the European protocol regarded change through week 24.  
Results 
Participant flow 
In study 102 (F/MF), of the 403 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 3 (0.7%) 
subjects (all in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group) prematurely discontinued treatment (2 due to an AE, 1 due 
a pregnancy). A total of 13 (3.2%) had an important protocol deviation (IPD), related to prohibited 
medication, acute illness, safety assessment and study drug. 
In study 103 (F/F), a total of 113 CF subjects were enrolled, of which 108 were randomized and 107 
received at least 1 dose of study drug in the treatment period. No subjects discontinued study drug 
treatment during the Treatment Period. A total of 2 (1.9%) had an important protocol deviation (IPD) 
related to prohibited medication and safety assessment. 
For both studies overall compliance was high.  
Recruitment 
Study 102 (F/MF) was conducted at 110 sites in US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. 
Study 103 was conducted at 44 sites in US and Europe. 
Conduct of the study 
Study 102 was amended 2 times. Table 5 lists the global protocol versions and global amendment

Baseline data 
For study 102 and 103, the demographic and baseline characteristics are provided in Table 6 and Table 
7, respectively. In general, the demographic and baseline characteristics are balanced between the two 
treatment groups. 
Concomitant medications 
The most common concomitant medications (continued and newly received) were medications typically 
used for management of CF.  
For study 102, three antibiotic treatments were used more often in the placebo group: Tobramycin 
(55.7% in the Placebo group vs 39% in the active group), Ciprofloxacin (35% in the placebo group vs 
16% of the active group) and Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (26.1% of the placebo group vs 
17.0% of the active group). 
For study 103, omeprazole seems to be used slightly more often in the TEZ/IVA group (28.8%) 
compared to the active treatment group (18.2%).

The efficacy analyses of study 102 (n=403) and 103 (n=107) were performed on the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS): all randomized subjects who carry the intended CFTR allele mutations and have received at 
least 1 dose of study drug.  
The modified FAS (m-FAS) excluded patients that did not meet the eligibility criteria or with significant 
deviations of study drug administration. In study 102, 2 patients were excluded (from placebo arm 
only) for the m-FAS and 8 patients (5 placebo, 3 active arm) were excluded from the mFAS analysis of

SwCl (pre-dose SwCl value <60.0 mmol/L). In 103, no m-FAS analysis was performed, as all patients 
met the criteria. 
From study 102, all 400 patients that complete dosing rolled over to the open-label study (Study 105). 
From study 103, all 107 patients rolled over to the open-label study (Study 105). 
Outcomes and estimation 
• 
Primary endpoint – Absolute change in ppFEV1 
In Study 102, treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
absolute change in ppFEV1 through Week 24 compared to placebo, with a treatment difference of 14.3 
percentage points (P<0.0001). Improvements in ppFEV1 were already seen at week 4 (secondary 
endpoints), with a statistically significant treatment difference of 13.7 percentage points (P<0.0001) 
(Table 9 and Figure 3). 
In Study 103, following a 4-week TEZ/IVA run-in, treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in absolute change in ppFEV1 at Week 4 
compared to TEZ/IVA, with a treatment difference of 10.0 percentage points (P<0.0001) ( 
Table 10 and Figure 4).

•  Key secondary endpoint – SwCl 
In Study 102, treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
absolute change in SwCl through Week 24 with a treatment difference of -41.8 mmol/L (P<0.0001) 
compared to placebo (Table 11 and Figure 5).  
In Study 103, following a 4-week TEZ/IVA run-in, statistically, significant improvements were also 
observed at Week 4 with a treatment difference of -45.1 mmol/L for VX-445/TEZ/IVA versus TEZ/IVA 
(P<0.0001) (Table 12 and Figure 6).

•  Key secondary endpoint – Respiratory Symptoms 
In Study 102, treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
absolute change in CFQ-R RD score through Week 24 with a treatment difference of 20.2 points 
(P<0.0001) compared to placebo (Table 13).  
In Study 103, statistically significant improvements were also observed at Week 4 with a treatment 
difference of 17.4 points for VX-445/TEZ/IVA versus TEZ/IVA (P<0.0001) (Table 14).

•  Key secondary endpoint – Pulmonary Exacerbations (only study 102) 
In Study 102, VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PEx through Week 24, 
with a PEx rate that was 63% lower in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group than the placebo group (rate ratio = 
0.37 [P<0.0001; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.55]). The annual event rate was 0.37 in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group 
versus 0.98 in the placebo group.  
Analysis of time-to-first PEx through Week 24 showed that a greater proportion of subjects in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group remained free of PEx than the proportion of subjects in the placebo group. The risk 
of a PEx is reduced when treated with the triple combination (HR: 0.34; 95% CI 0.22, 0.52; 
p<0.0001). 
Table 15 Negative binomial analysis of the number of pEx during the PEx analysis period 
(FAS) 
For subjects included in study 103, results on nutritional status will be displayed with study 105. 
•  Key secondary endpoint – Nutritional status (only study 102) 
In Study 102, statistically significant improvements were observed for absolute change from baseline 
in BMI, with a treatment difference of 1.04 kg/m2 (P<0.0001) for VX-445/TEZ/IVA versus placebo at 
Week 24. Improvements were also observed for absolute change from baseline in BMI z-score and 
body weight at Week 24, with a treatment difference in BMI z-score of 0.30 (nominal P<0.0001) and a 
treatment difference in body weight of 2.9 kg (nominal P<0.0001) for VX-445/TEZ/IVA versus placebo 
(Table 16).  
For subject included in study 103, results on nutritional status will be displayed at study 105.

Ancillary analyses 
Efficacy subsets (m-FAS) 
For study 102, results from the M-FAS were consistent with the analysis performed by the FAS.  
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 32/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For study 103, no analyses were done using subset of subjects in the FAS. 
Subgroup analyses 
Prespecified subgroup analyses of the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline were performed 
similarly to the primary analysis. For both studies, the results of the subgroup analyses were 
consistent with the results of the primary analyses. Due to the small size of study 103, some 
subgroups have a limited number of subjects (Figure 7 and Figure 8).

in ppFEV1 Through week 24 (percentage points), FAS 
Figure 8: Study 103 (F/F Subjects): Subgroup analysis for absolute change from baseline in 
ppFEV1 at week 4 (percentage points), FAS 
To further explore the hypothesis that a single F508del allele is sufficient to provide substantial clinical 
efficacy, an ad hoc analysis was performed to assess outcomes in F/MF subjects in Study 102 with a

Class I MF mutation (n = 314, ~78% of the overall study population) (criterion 1) and patients not 
responding in vitro to IVA or TEZ/IVA (missense or in-frame deletion, criterion 2). Treatment of these 
subjects with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in an absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 
24 of 14.8 percentage points when compared to placebo for patient included based on criterion 1 and 
of 12.9 percentage points for patients included based on criterion 2). The outcome of this analysis was 
similar to the overall study outcome (14.3 percentage points) (See Table 17).

Analysis description  Ancillary analysis 
The Forest Plot for the subgroups analysed, shows a consistent beneficial 
effect for VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to placebo. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
All trials included adolescents and adults.  
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were performed using a model similar to that for the 
primary analysis. Subgroup analyses showed consistent changes in ppFEV1 regardless of age, sex, 
baseline lung function, geographic region, prior use of common CF medications, and P. aeruginosa 
colonization.  
Studies 102 and 103 excluded pregnant and lactating women, and also excluded subjects with a 
history of any illness or condition that could confound study results or pose an additional safety risk 
(e.g., clinically significant hepatic cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension).

Both studies did not include any patients aged 65 years and older; thus, it is not known whether they 
respond differently from younger adults patients. 
Supportive study 
Study VX17-445-105 
Open-label extension study in subjects that completed study treatment in study 102 and 
103.  
Subjects who completed Studies 102 (n=400) and 103 (n=107) and met eligibility criteria were 
enrolled in OLE Study 105. All subjects receive the same dose of VX 445/TEZ/IVA as the VX 
445/TEZ/IVA arms of Studies 102 and 103. The treatment duration in Study 105 is 96 weeks. This 
duration is considered sufficient for the evaluation of long-term safety and efficacy. 
The primary objective of Study 105 is safety. The secondary efficacy endpoints in Study 105 are 
similar to the pivotal studies 102 and 103 (e.g. ppFEV1, PEx, SwCL, CFQ-R RD, BMI). 
Updated Interim Analysis study data (IA2) are provided for F/MF (study 102) and F/F subjects (study 
103) with data cut-off date of 31 October 2019. 
Results for F/MF subjects

Analysis performed across trials (meta-analysis) 
A PDCO-requested cross-study comparison (PIP Study C9 Meta-analysis) was performed to provide at 
least 24 weeks of comparative efficacy data for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA regimens in F/F 
subjects.  
This cross-study comparison included data from  
•  2 studies evaluating VX-445/TEZ/IVA (Studies 103 and OLE 105) and  
•  2 studies evaluating TEZ/IVA (Studies 661-106 and OLE 661-110) (used to support the MA for 
TEZ/IVA in F/F patients).  
Baseline in Study 103 was defined after 4 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA (TEZ/IVA Run-in Period). 
In contrast, baseline in Study 661-106 was defined relative to a period without CFTR modulator 
treatment. To enable a comparison of efficacy, the first 4 weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment in Study 661-
106 were considered a nominal TEZ/IVA Run-in Period to match the 4-week TEZ/IVA Run-in Period in 
Study 103. As a result, baseline values of efficacy endpoints for subjects in Study 661-106 were re-
derived as measured at the Week 4 Visit (Figure 13). 
Figure 13: Meta-analysis baseline and analysis period for efficacy endpoints 
For the efficacy analysis, subjects from the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group in Study 103 and the TEZ/IVA 
group in Study 106 were compared; the control groups i.e. TEZ/IVA group in Study 103 and the 
placebo group in Study 106 were not included. 
Overall, the demographics and baseline characteristics of subjects in the meta-analysis were very 
similar between the VX-445/TEZ/IVA patients and the TEZ/IVA patients in terms of age, sex, baseline 
ppFEV1, and baseline SwCl. In terms of the numbers analysed for the efficacy analysis, 55 were 
included from the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 246 from the TEZ/IVA group in the FAS.  
Following the 4-week TEZ/IVA run-in, treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 24 weeks in F/F 
subjects resulted in robust and clinically meaningful improvements in pulmonary and non-pulmonary 
endpoints (Table 78). Statistically significant improvements in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group compared to 
the TEZ/IVA group were observed for ppFEV1 through 28 weeks of treatment (10.7 percentage 
points), PEx rate (55% reduction), SwCl (-43.8 mmol/L), CFQ-R RD score (16.5 points), and BMI (1.19 
kg/m2). These results provide further support for the superiority of VX 445/TEZ/IVA versus TEZ/IVA.

Responder analysis performed across trials (meta-analysis) 
Analysis Methods 
Responder analyses for ppFEV1 were conducted using data from 7 pivotal Phase 3 studies of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA (Studies 102 and 103), TEZ/IVA (Studies 661-106 and 661-108), or IVA (Studies 770-
102, 770-110, and 770-111). An individual subject in Study 102 was classified as a responder based 
on 2 different thresholds, either ppFEV1 ≥2.5 or ≥5.0 percentage points, if the average of Week 4, 
Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and Week 24) is greater than or equal to 2.5 or 5.0, respectively. 
Subjects in whom all Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and Week 24 ppFEV1 data were missing 
were classified as non-responders. An individual subject in Study 103 was classified as a responder in 
a similar fashion, using absolute change from base in ppFEV1 at Week 4. Because of the difference in 
study design, the baseline in Study 103 is defined after the 4-week TEZ/IVA run-in; thus, caution 
should be taken when comparing Study 103 versus other studies. The responders for TEZ/IVA or IVA 
studies are defined similarly to Study 102, based on the primary ppFEV1 endpoint. 
The number and percentage of subjects who had improvements in ppFEV1 of ≥2.5 and ≥5.0 
percentage points are summarized in Table 25. To account for differences in study populations, the 
placebo-adjusted proportion of subjects with improvements in ppFEV1 of ≥2.5 and ≥5.0 percentage 
points was calculated as the mathematical difference between the percentage of responders in the 
active treatment group and the placebo group (with the exception of Study 103, which was adjusted 
using the TEZ/IVA comparator group as there was no placebo group in that study). 
Results 
These analyses show that a larger proportion of subjects responded to VX445/TEZ/IVA treatment 
versus placebo in Study 102 than in the pivotal studies for TEZ/IVA and IVA. This is consistent with the 
substantial magnitude of benefit observed with VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment. 
F/G and F/RF patients treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA will benefit from fully leveraging both alleles. For 
the reasons outlined above, a greater proportion of F/G and F/RF patients will respond to VX-
445/TEZ/IVA compared to TEZ/IVA and IVA, respectively.

Real World Data 
Upon request from CHMP, the MAH provided additional information from the US Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) on F/G and F/RF patients and for F/MF and F/F patients treated 
with VX-445/TEZ/IVA in the post-authorization setting; this fixed dose combination has been 
authorised in the US in October 2019 for the initially broader proposed indication in F/any patients.  
Data collected by the CFFPR are provided as aggregate data reports only. The MAH did not have access 
to patient-level data in the registry. Available information has been provided below. 
F/MF and F/F 
Population 
CF patients who met the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) had a CFFPR record of 
initiating treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA between 21 October 2019 and 31 December 2019, (2) were 
aged 12 years and older on the date of treatment initiation, (3) had a F/MF or F/F genotype, and (4) 
had ppFEV1 assessments available both within 90 days before (baseline) and any time after (follow-
up) treatment initiation through 15 March 2020. F/MF subjects included in this analysis had MF 
mutations that were defined consistently with those in Study 102. 
The analysis population is summarized in  
Figure 14.

Figure 14: Patient population included in the CFFPR analyses 
Individual patient-level genotype data for the analysis population were not available in this data cut. 
From 21 October 2019 through 31 December 2019, a total of 1,448 F/MF and 3,178 F/F patients had a 
record of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation in CFFPR; of those patients, 995 (68.7%) and 2,200 
(69.2%) respectively had lung function measurements available both at baseline and follow-up and 
were included in these analyses. 
The F/MF patients had a mean age of 26.3 years and mean treatment duration of 65.6 days. The F/F 
patients had a mean age of 26.7 years and mean treatment duration of 65.4 days. 
Outcomes and Data Analysis 
Improvement in lung function, as assessed by ppFEV1, was used to determine the treatment effect 
with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. Other efficacy parameters (e.g., SwCl, CFQ-R) are not routinely collected in the 
clinical practice and/or not captured in the CFFPR and thus were not evaluated in this analysis. 
The most recent measurement obtained within 90 days before VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation 
served as the baseline value. The last measurement available in the period following therapy initiation 
on or before 15 March 2020 served as the follow-up value. The change in ppFEV1 was calculated as a 
difference between the follow-up and baseline value for each patient, and data were summarized for 
F/MF and F/F subgroups using summary statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], 95% confidence 
intervals [CI]). 
Patients who were initiated on VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment in 2019 were followed from the date of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation through 15 March 2020. Treatment duration was calculated for each 
patient as the difference in days between the date of treatment initiation and the date of the last 
available post-treatment ppFEV1. Mean treatment durations were calculated for the F/MF and F/F 
subgroups separately. 
Mean patient age at the time of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation was summarized for the F/MF and 
F/F subgroups separately. 
Recent use of CFTR modulator therapy prior to VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation was defined as 
any record in the registry of exposure to CFTR modulator therapy in 2019 prior to the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
treatment initiation date; the actual CFTR modulator therapy used prior to VX-445/TEZ/IVA was not 
available in this data cut. Precise start and stop dates for LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA are not available in the 
CFFPR and the exposure status was determined based on the presence or absence of the treatment 
record at each patient encounter. In 2019, in anticipation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA, CFFPR introduced a new 
data collection element to capture the approximate date the patient started taking therapy, which 
allowed more precise estimation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA initiation date in this analysis. 
Results 
As expected, based on the market availability of CFTR modulators indicated for patients with F/F 
genotype (LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA), the vast majority of the F/F patients included in this analysis were 
receiving CFTR modulator therapy prior to initiating VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment (91.5% were exposed 
Assessment report

to at least one other CFTR modulator in 2019). In contrast, consistent with the lack of approved CFTR 
modulator therapy for the F/MF population, only 2.9% of F/MF patients had a record of receiving CFTR 
modulator therapy prior to initiating VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment. 
Mean baseline ppFEV1 values were 65.7 for the F/MF patients and 65.8 for the F/F patients. An 
improvement in ppFEV1 from baseline was observed for both genotype groups: mean of 10.9 
percentage points (95% CI: 10.0, 11.8) for the F/MF patients and 9.0 percentage points (95% CI: 8.6, 
9.4) for the F/F patients (Table 26).  
The data from CFFPR in F/MF and F/F patients demonstrate the transformational benefit of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA in these patients. The results are consistent with results from the pivotal clinical studies 
in F/MF and F/F (Table 26).

and F/F patients 
F/RF and F/G 
Population 
CF patients who met the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) had a CFFPR record of 
initiating treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA between 21 October 2019 and 31 December 2019, (2) were 
aged 12 years and older on the date of treatment initiation, (3) had a F/G or F/RF genotype, and (4) 
had ppFEV1 assessments available both within 90 days before (baseline) and any time after (follow-
up) treatment initiation through 15 March 2020. The gating and RF mutations included were consistent 
with the eligible population in Study 104, and reflect the gating mutations for which Kalydeco is 
indicated and the RF mutations for which both Kalydeco and Symdeko are indicated in the US.  
Gating mutations eligible for inclusion in the analyses were G1069R, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551D, 
G551S, R1070Q, R117H, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R. 
RF mutations eligible for inclusion in the analyses were 2789+5G->A, 3272-26A->G, 3849+10kbC->T, 
711+3A->G, A1067T, A455E, D110E, D110H, D1152H, D1270N, D579G, E193K, E56K, E831X,

Individual patient-level genotype data for the analysis population were not available in this data cut. 
From 21 October 2019 through 31 December 2019, a total of 521 F/G or F/RF patients had a record of 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation in CFFPR. Of these patients, 297 patients (57%) had lung function

measurements available both at baseline and follow-up and were included in these analyses. Their 
mean treatment duration was 63.4 days. 
Results 
There were 136 F/G patients who had a mean age of 32.3 years and a mean treatment duration of 
62.8 days. There were 161 F/RF patients who had a mean age of 40.3 years and a mean treatment 
duration of 63.8 days. As expected, based on the market availability of CFTR modulators indicated for 
patients with gating (IVA) and RF (IVA, TEZ/IVA) mutations, the vast majority of the F/G and F/RF 
patients included in this analysis were receiving CFTR modulator therapy prior to initiating VX-
445/TEZ/IVA treatment (97.8% of F/G patients and 89.4% F/RF patients were exposed to at least one 
other CFTR modulator in 2019). 
Mean baseline ppFEV1 values were 69.0 for the F/G patients and 66.6 for the F/RF patients. An 
improvement in ppFEV1 from baseline was observed for both genotype groups: mean of 4.3 
percentage points (95% CI: 2.7, 5.9) for the F/G patients, and 2.7 percentage points (95% CI: 1.7, 
3.7) for the F/RF patients (Table 27). 
Table 27 CFFPR data for F/G and F/RF patients 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In this variation, the MAH initially applied for the inclusion of the following indication in section 4.1. of 
Kalydeco SmPC: 
“Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with elexacaftor 100 mg/tezacaftor 50 
mg/ivacaftor 75 mg tablets for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with 
cystic fibrosis (CF) who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.” 
The initially claimed indication includes patients with F508del and a so called ‘minimal function’ 
mutation i.e. F/MF genotypes, a group which has not responded to the currently approved CFTR 
modulating options. It also includes patients with the F/F genotype, as well as patients with F/G 
(F508del with a gating mutation) as well as F/RF (F508del with a residual function mutation). For some 
patients, e.g. F/F patients and those patients with F/RF and F/G genotypes who currently have 
approved therapies, this triple therapy could replace the existing therapy. The MAH considered that the 
triple combination targets and exerts its effect entirely by correcting the CFTR defect caused by the 
F508del allele, regardless of what second allele is present, and sees this as a new treatment approach. 
However, as discussed below, the F508del-only paradigm has not been fully substantiated, and 
therefore robust clinical data in F/G and F/RF populations are needed to support the inclusion of these 
patients in the indication. The indication was therefore restricted, in line with Kaftrio indication  
The discussion below outlines the rationale for the indication of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio as 
discussed in the Kaftrio CHMP AR (EMEA/H/C/005269/0000).

Design and conduct of the studies 
Dosing of VX-445 was investigated in one Phase 1/2 study, Study 001. In healthy volunteers, single 
and multiple ascending doses were tested ranging from 20mg – 340 mg per dose VX-445. In patients, 
different doses (50mg, 100mg and 200mg) daily were tested in F/MF subjects. In F/F patients, only 
the final 200mg dose was tested.  
Efficacy and safety have been evaluated in three phase 3 studies in CF patients aged 12 years and 
older. Study 102 in subjects heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation (F/MF) and 
study 103 in subjects homozygous for F508del (F/F) are the core efficacy studies. These studies were 
randomised double-blind, controlled multicentre studies. Study 105 was designed to support 
persistence of efficacy and long-term safety. Results are currently submitted as an interim analysis 
(IA2). 
Furthermore, a cross-study comparison “the Meta-analysis”, requested by the PDCO, was performed 
in which the results of Studies 103 and 105 and the phase 3 studies for Symkevi (study 106 and 110) 
were pooled and compared. 
Upon request by CHMP, real world data (from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, 
CFFPR) from a post-authorization setting were also provided. 
Comparator  
In the F/MF patient population (study 001 and 102), placebo was used as the comparator. This is 
considered to be an acceptable treatment arm because no other approved regimens have shown 
clinical efficacy in the F/MF populations, justifying the absence of TEZ/IVA or LUM/IVA arm.  
In the F/F population (study 001 and 103), TEZ/IVA was used as the comparator, in patients already 
treated with TEZ/IVA. This is also considered an acceptable treatment arm because it is the best 
approved regimen in the F/F population. However, the choice of only placebo in F/MF or TEZ/IVA in F/F 
as a comparator can be questioned. The added effect of VX-445/TEZ/IVA over VX-445 monotherapy or 
VX-445/IVA is solely based on in vitro and mechanistic data. These data suggest that the triple 
combination provides additional benefit over all mono/dual therapies in both F/MF and F/F cells. It also 
indicates that TEZ and VX-445 can bind simultaneously to the CFTR protein (only wild-type CFTR 
tested). Nevertheless, clinical evaluation of VX-445 monotherapy and VX-445/IVA compared with the 
TC, was strongly recommended in Scientific Advices given by CHMP and national authorities. This is 
also in line with the Guideline for Fixed Dose Combinations (EMA/CHMP/158268/2017) which states 
that “clinical trials demonstrating efficacy/safety of the new active substance as monotherapy” should 
be performed. While information on the safety of VX-445 can be derived from the currently provided 
and previously submitted clinical studies performed with placebo and TEZ/IVA; clinical efficacy data 
would be required, in particular, compared to the VX-445/IVA combination. However, it is considered 
that in vitro results, confirming the added benefit of the combination of two correctors (VX-445 and 
TEZ) over VX-445 alone provides valuable information and demonstrates that both correctors VX-445 
and TEZ are required in combination with a potentiator (IVA). 
The HBE cells used to generate in vitro data can be regarded as a relevant model system to study the 
pharmacological action of CFTR modulators. Three donors with an F/F genotype were analysed and 4 
donors with an F/MF genotype (2x G452X (non-sense); 3905InsT (small insertion); E585X (non-
sense). In study 102; 65, 5 and 1 patients with this genotype were included respectively.  
The in vitro data suggest that the triple combination does provide a benefit over all mono and dual 
combination of VX-445, TEZ and IVA in all tested donors. 
Uncertainties remain on the contribution of all components, as not all combination are tested in a 
clinical setting and the FDC guideline is not followed. Nevertheless, the in vitro data, the highly 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 51/108 
 
 
 
clinically relevant benefit and well-tolerated safety profile of the VX-445/TEZ/IVA in the F/MF and F/F 
population are considered relevant enough to outweigh these uncertainties on the contribution of the 
mono-components in a clinical setting.  
Duration 
The duration of the dose finding study 001 of 28 days is acceptable for the objective. The 24-week 
treatment period of pivotal study 102 is in line with the EMA guideline on CF and CHMP’s scientific 
advice (SA) received. However, the 4-week treatment period of pivotal study 103 is not in line with 
guidelines and SA, thus, robust conclusion cannot be drawn on the sustainability of the effect of the 
triple combination. The MAH considered the short duration acceptable as a sustained benefit from day 
15 towards week 24 has always been shown in studies with other modifiers. Although this has indeed 
been observed, the results from the in between time were fluctuating and not completely stable. 
Furthermore, important efficacy parameters such as exacerbations and BMI cannot be reliably 
measured in a study with a duration of 4 weeks. Therefore, a 4-week study is too short to establish a 
long-term clinical benefit. The open label extension study (Study 105) provides further data on the 
maintenance of efficacy and long-term safety, which is considered acceptable. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
The in-and exclusion criteria for the dose-response study 001, and pivotal trials 102 and 103 were 
largely similar, except for age (dose response only adult patients, pivotal also adolescents) and the 
genotype mutations. Patients had to have FEV1 ≥40% and ≤ 90% and stable CF. Diagnosis of CF was 
confirmed by the investigator. Only a limited number of patients with a SwCl of < 60 mmol/L were 
included in the trial 102 (and sensitivity analysis without these patients show consistent results). No 
patients with a SwCl of < 60 mmol/L at baseline were included in study 103. 
F/F and F/MF population 
In study 102, the definition of an MF mutation was quite unusual. The MAH defines an MF mutation as 
follows: (1) no CFTR protein or (2) a CFTR protein that is not responsive to IVA and TEZ/IVA in vitro. A 
mutation was considered an MF mutation if it meets at least 1 of the following 2 criteria: 
(1) biological plausibility of no translated protein (genetic sequence predicts the complete absence of 
CFTR protein). A list of eligible MF mutations was specified.  
(2) in vitro testing that supports lack of responsiveness to TEZ, IVA, or TEZ/IVA, and evidence of 
clinical severity on a population basis (as reported in large patient registries). 
• 
In vitro baseline chloride transport of < 10% of WT CFTR and increase of chloride transport 
<10% over baseline after TEZ, IVA or TEZ/IVA. 
•  Clinical severity (CFTR2 patients registry)  average sweat chloride >86 mmol/L and 
prevalence of pancreatic insufficiently (PI) > 50%.  
With regard to criterion (1), the pre-specified list contains mutations that are likely to have no CFTR 
translated protein. The idea of the MAH that VX-445/TEZ/IVA only requires one F508del allele is based 
on the fact that the (included) MF mutations in trial 102 have no protein and therefore the effect seen 
has to be caused by the F508del allele. Although plausible, it is possible that some of the MF mutants 
may have a minor contribution to the CFTR-mediated chloride transport upon treatment with VX-
445/TEZ/IVA.  
With regard to criterion (2), the 10% cut-off seems acceptable as it has been used and justified in 
previous procedures. The mutations were tested for non-responsiveness to VX-445/TEZ/IVA. In FRT 
cells, 8 mutations (3199del16, A559T, I507del, L467P, N1303K, R1066C, R560T, V520F) did not 
respond to VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment, while 4 mutations (G85E, M1101K, L1077P and R347P) did 
show responsiveness. However, the inclusion and responsiveness data are based on the assumption 
that in vitro data do correlate with in vivo data, while an IVIVC is not established.   
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 52/108 
 
 
 
Therefore, the results from the patients included based on criterion (1), which is 78% of the patients, 
is mainly considered of value (provided as an ad-hoc analysis). The efficacy in this subset and in 
genotype subgroups could be used to draw conclusions on the acceptability of the “new paradigm” i.e. 
only one single F508del allele is required. The totality of evidence generated in the pivotal clinical 
studies could be considered to draw a conclusion on whether the F508del allele is the main target of 
action (see further discussion below). 
In terms of F/F patients entering Study 103 some patients may have already been on therapy at the 
time of screening, and indeed could continue therapy right up to the start of the TEZ/IVA run in, while 
others may have been naïve to Vertex CFTR modulators (of note, those on non-Vertex CFTR 
modulators had a wash out prior to screening). Stratification according to ppFEV1 was applied on the 
ppFEV1 measurements taken after at least 13 days of TEZ/IVA run-in, rather than the screening 
ppFEV1 values. A subgroup analysis for Vertex CFTR modulator naïve versus treatment-experienced 
patients indicates that the magnitude of the observed treatment effect (LS mean 7.8%, 95% CI (4.8, 
10.8)) for CFTR modulator experienced patients is less than that for CFTR modulator naïve patients (LS 
mean 13.2%, 95% CI (8.5, 17.9). Overall various subgroup analyses do not suggest a differential 
treatment effect for CFTR-modulator naïve and CFTR-modulator experienced patients. However, 
subjects who were CFTR modulator naïve had a lower mean baseline ppFEV1 value (58.5 for the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group and 57.2 for the TEZ/IVA group) than subjects who were CFTR modulator 
experienced (63.8 for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 61.8 for the TEZ/IVA group). Although the small 
sample size in these subgroups is acknowledged, comparison of the week 4 and week 8 ppFEV1 values 
across these four subgroups suggests that the screening period of 4 weeks may not have been 
sufficient for CFTR-modulator naïve patients randomized to TEZ/IVA to derive the full benefit of this 
treatment by time of baseline ppFEV1 assessment. Consequently, it is considered that the magnitude 
of the treatment effect of VX-445/TEZ/IVA vs TEZ/IVA in the overall study 102 population may be 
overestimated and that the treatment effect estimate obtained in the CFTR-modulator experienced 
patients is relevant to prescribers (LS mean 7.8%, 95% CI (4.8,10.8)).  
Study 105 is an extension study and enrolled subjects who participated in study 102 and 103.  
Endpoints 
The parameters ppFEV1 and SwCl endpoints were used in the dose response study 001. These 
parameters are acceptable endpoints to define the Dose-Response relationship. 
For the pivotal studies 102 and 103, the primary endpoint was an absolute change in LS mean ppFEV1 
(through week 24 and at week 4, for study 102 and 103 respectively). ppFEV1 is the advocated 
primary endpoint in EMA’s guideline on CF (CHMP/EWP/9147/08). The key secondary efficacy 
endpoints in study 102 (number of pulmonary exacerbations, absolute change in SwCl, absolute change 
in CFQ-R RD Score and absolute change in BMI) and study 103 (absolute change in SwCl and absolute 
change in CFQ-R RD Score) are all accepted endpoints in clinical trials on CF. The same endpoints were 
used in study 105.   
Efficacy on other organs could have been explored by analysing faecal elastase-1, plasma IRT, bile 
acids C4 and FGF. However, such data were not collected as the included subjects are likely to have 
progressive damage to their exocrine pancreas that is irreversible.  
Statistical Analyses 
For study 102, the primary analysis was performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) with change from baseline at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24 as the 
dependent variable. The model included treatment group, visit, and treatment by visit interaction as 
fixed effects, with continuous baseline ppFEV1, age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) and

sex (male versus female) as covariates. Type I error was controlled through a hierarchical testing-
procedure.  
For study 103, a MMRM was also used, but with Day 15 and Week 4 as the dependent variable and 
with continuous baseline ppFEV1 and age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) as covariates. 
The use of a MMRM for the evaluation of the primary endpoint in both studies is acceptable. The 
analyses used to examine the secondary endpoints are also acceptable.  
In extension study 105, a MMRM was also used to estimate the change from baseline in ppFEV1 at 
each time point.  
In both pivotal studies, a sensitivity analysis was performed for the evaluation of the primary 
endpoints. This sensitivity analysis was based on the classification of patients with missing data into a 
number of missing categories and may not have been sufficiently sensitive to examine departures from 
the missing at random assumption. However, the rate of missing data is low.  
Efficacy and additional analyses 
Dose regimen 
Adults and Adolescents 
The intended dosing regimen (VX-445 200 mg qd, TEZ 100 mg qd and IVA 150 mg q12h), is 
acceptable, and therefore 150 mg Ivacaftor was used in the pivotal studies as an evening dose in 
combination with Kaftrio, administered in the morning.   
The posology for special population is addressed later in this section.  
Pivotal studies 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/MF genotype (study 102) 
In pivotal study 102, the demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two 
treatment groups. In terms of the F/MF genotypes represented in the clinical study, across the 403 
F/MF subjects in the FAS, 79 different MF mutations have been represented. 314/403 patients had 
Class I (i.e. no CFTR) mutation; in total 67 Class I mutations were recruited. In terms of mutations 
that are not Class I, (i.e. qualified under Criterion 2), 12 MF mutation types were recruited (missense 
or in frame deletion mutations) in 89 patients. Due to the genetic variability of CF as a disease, it is 
understood that not all genotypes will be able to be tested. 
The inclusion of patients with ppFEV1 <40 (34/403) did not comply with the inclusion criteria. The 
inclusion criterion pertaining to screening ppFEV1 was met in all enrolled subjects in Study 102, but 
the ppFEV1 decreased at their baseline study visit. 
Three concomitant antibiotic treatments were used more often in the placebo group (Tobramycin: 
55.7% vs 39%; Ciprofloxacin: 36% vs 16%; Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim: 26.1% vs 17.0%). 
This difference can be attributed to the imbalance in the occurrence of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) 
(numerically higher in the placebo group). These antibiotic usage differences are a consequence of the 
effectiveness of the VX-445/TEZ/IVA regimen. 
Missing data for the repeated measurements data was not an issue (less than 10%).  
For the primary endpoint, the LS mean treatment difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 through 
week 24 between the VX-445TEZ/IVA and placebo groups was 14.3% (95% CI: 12.7 – 15.8; 
p<0.0001) in favour of the triple combination. The obtained difference was above the predefined 
threshold (5.0%) and considered clinically relevant (Report of the workshop on endpoints for cystic 
fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012)). Approximately 80% patients treated with the TC have a

benefit of ppFEV1 >5%, compared to 15% in the placebo group. The result of the sensitivity analysis, 
a MMRM based on multiple imputations (MIs), was consistent with the primary analysis.  
The key secondary endpoint, absolute change in ppFEV1 in 4 weeks, was in line with the results of the 
primary endpoint at 24 weeks (13.7 %; P<0.0001; 95% CI: 12.0, 15.3). This suggests a stable 
improvement from 4 weeks on.  
For the key secondary endpoints pulmonary exacerbations, the rate ratio was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.25 – 
0.55, p<0.0001) in favour of VX-445/TEZ/IVA. This is a reduction of 63%, which is considered 
clinically relevant. Also, the reductions in exacerbations requiring hospitalization and/or IV antibiotic 
treatment were statistically and clinically significant. The hazard ratio for time-to-first pulmonary 
exacerbation was also in favour of the triple combination (HR: 0.34; 95% CI 0.22, 0.52; p<0.0001). 
For the key secondary endpoint, changes in SwCl from baseline, the stable reduction of -41.8 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -44.4 to -39.3; p< 0.0001) through week 24 compared to placebo is considered clinically 
relevant (MCID: -10 mmol/L). Approximately 95% of the patients treated with the TC had clinically 
relevant benefit, compared to only 5% in the placebo group.   
Also, a key secondary endpoint, change in CRQ-R RD score, improved significantly in the TC arm 
compared to the placebo arm (20.2 points; 95% CI 17.5,23.0; p<0.0001).  With an MCID of 4 points, 
this increase in considered clinically relevant, all other CFQ-R domains indicated also an improvement 
with the TC compared to placebo, consistent with the results of the key secondary endpoint absolute 
change in BMI (1.04 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.23; p<0.0001) compared to placebo).  
At baseline, median BMI baseline was 20.80 kg/m2 (min, max: 14.42, 33.80) in the placebo group and 
21.36 (15.01, 30.86) in the TC group. In total, study 102 recruited 50 overweight patients, and 17 
undernourished patients. Therefore, there were an unknown number of underweight subjects as well 
as of overweight/obese patients. An analysis of BMI was provided for undernourished and overweight 
subjects according to the WHO thresholds, both overweight and underweight patients treated with VX-
445/TEZ/IVA showed gains in BMI consistent with the overall population. 
Consistent and significant benefits in ppFEV1 favouring VX-445/TEZ/IVA were observed across all 
prespecified subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, P. aeruginosa infection, and baseline 
use of common CF medications.  
An ad-hoc subgroup analysis was performed on patients included based on genetic criterion 1 (likely to 
have no CFTR protein translated) and on criterion 2 (missense not responding the TEZ and/or IVA in 
vitro). Class 1 (MF) mutant patients show an absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 of 14.8% 
comparing the triple combination with placebo. The missense mutant patients showed a difference in 
ppFEV1 of 12.9%. Furthermore, for the criterion 1 mutations, a subdivision was made for Nonsense 
mutations, Canonical splice mutations and insertions/deletions leading to a frameshift. For missense 
and in-frame deletions (criterion 2) a subdivision was made for mutations that were responsive or not 
to the triple therapy. The outcomes of these analyses were similar to the overall study outcome.  
Within the IA2 from study 105, the efficacy data were presented for patients from parent study 102. 
These data show that the positive treatment effect continues to be maintained with continued 
treatment. In general, the data indicates that for MF patients from the “placebo” group, treatment with 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA results in a similar benefit for all efficacy parameters when compared to the group 
that received the triple combination in study 102 already. When comparing the data from week 24 and 
week 48 for the patients that received the triple combination in study 102 already, all the efficacy 
parameters still seem to improve (slightly). Outcomes of subgroup analyses for FEV1 and SwCL 
performed for the different MF genotypes were similar to the overall study outcome.

CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype (study 103/105) 
In pivotal study 103, the demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two 
treatment groups. Missing data for the repeated measurements data was not an issue (less than 
10%).  
For the primary endpoint, the LS mean treatment difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 at week 4 
between the VX-445TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA groups was 10.0% (95% CI: 7.4 – 12.6; p<0.0001) in 
favour of the triple combination. The obtained difference was above the predefined threshold (5.0%) 
and considered clinically relevant. Approximately 70% patients treated with the TC have a benefit of 
ppFEV1 >5%, compared to 13% in the TEZ/IVA group.  
For the key secondary endpoint, change in SwCl from baseline, a positive effect is observed after 
treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to TEZ/IVA. A stable reduction of -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -
50.1 to -40.1; p< 0.0001) at week 4 is considered clinically relevant. Approximately 95% of the 
patients had a clinically relevant reduction in SwCl, when treated with the triple combination. 
Change in CRQ-R RD score, key secondary endpoint, also improved significantly in the TC arm 
compared to the TEZ/IVA arm (17.4 points; 95% CI 11.8,23.0; p<0.0001). Also, all other CFQ-R 
domains indicated an improvement with the TC compared to TEZ/IVA. 
Although no robust conclusion can be drawn, ad hoc analyses on BMI and weight also seem to 
demonstrate the beneficial effect of the TC over TEZ/IVA.  
Consistent benefits in ppFEV1 favouring VX-445/TEZ/IVA were observed across all prespecified 
subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, P. aeruginosa infection, and baseline use of 
common CF medications. 
Extension study 105 
Because of the short (4 week) duration of study 103, also the result from the extension study 105 
were analysed to identify whether the effects seen at 4 weeks, remained stable up to 24 weeks of 
treatment. All patients rolled over to study 105, in which the patients from the TEZ/IVA group also 
received the triple combination. 
The results for the change in ppFEV1, SwCl and CFQ-R RD showed maintenance of response when 
treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. Subjects treated with the TC in the parent study continued to have a 
similar benefit at 4 weeks and through 24 weeks of treatment, respectively (ppFEV1: 10.4 vs 10.9 
percentage points; SwCL: -43.4 vs -47.2 mmol/L; CFQ-R RD: 16 vs 14.3 points).   
With a longer follow-up, data for pulmonary exacerbations and the nutritional status also became 
available. 
For the number of PEx, an estimated event rate per year of 0.30 (95% CI: 0.18-0.48) and a 
probability of event-free survival of 0.859 (95% CI: 0.777-0.912) was anticipated. For this endpoint, 
no control-group, or event rate at baseline was present. Therefore, the benefit over TEZ/IVA is difficult 
to determine. When comparing the observed PEx data for study 103/105 to the data from the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group in study 102 (event rate per year 0.37 (0.25, 0.55); probability of event-free 
survival 0.842 (0.783, 0.886), this is considered similar. Therefore, the presented exacerbation results 
for F/F patients from study 105, seem supportive for the benefit seen with the TC.  
With regard to the nutritional status, a benefit compared to baseline was observed for all parameters 
(change in BMI, BMI z-score and body weight). 
Overall, the efficacy results from the F/F patients in study 105, confirmed that also in this patient 
population a long-term benefit can be seen after treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. These results 
overcome the uncertainties that went along with the 4-week study duration of study 103.

Cross study comparison/Responder analysis 
In addition, a responder analysis was performed for the 7 pivotal Phase 3 studies of VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
(Studies 102 and 103), TEZ/IVA (Studies 661-106 and 661-108), or IVA (Studies 770-102, 770-110, 
and 770-111). The comparison between the placebo controlled studies in patients with at least one 
F508del allele (study 661-108 (F/RF), study 661-106 (F/F) and study 102 (F/MF) could suggest that at 
least an additional 20% of patients will have a clinically relevant response to VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
compared to TEZ/IVA. However, this would be a useful comparison if the F/any paradigm would be 
well demonstrated (which currently is not), and therefore by extension that it could be accepted that 
all genotypes with one F can be assumed to respond sufficiently. 
Moreover, the comparisons are based on cross-study comparisons with different populations, which 
introduces uncertainties and these comparisons cannot be considered as additional evidence for the 
F/any paradigm or to support extrapolation of findings in the F/MF population to the F/G and F/RF 
populations. The CHMP considered that the F/any hypothesis has not been conclusively demonstrated. 
As such, the F/G and F/RF require their own demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety. It is thus 
considered that these comparisons while interesting, do not obviate the need for robust, comparative, 
clinical data in F/G and F/RF patients from clinical studies. 
Real world clinical data 
Upon request by CHMP, the MAH provided real world data from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
Patient Registry (CFFPR) for F/RF and F/G and also F/F and F/MF patients treated with VX-
445/TEZ/IVA.  
F/RF and F/G patients who started with VX-445/TEZ/IVA therapy between 21 October 2019 and 31 
December 2019 (n=521), who had a lung function measurement at baseline and follow-up (n=297, 
57%) were included in the analyses. Only ppFEV1 values were provided, as other efficacy parameters 
are not routinely measured. The registry data from the F/MF and F/F patient population showed results 
in line with the effects observed in studies 102 and 103. 
The U.S. CFFPR data presented are in itself limited and not sufficiently detailed, and as such raised 
several questions such as the exact modulator therapy used, the duration of use which is not known, 
as well as included specific genotypes and individual patient efficacy data which are not presented. 
Unavailability of such information is inherent to registry data but does introduce uncertainties. It can 
also be questioned whether the patients in the analysis set can be considered sufficiently 
representative of the overall F/G and F/RF populations to allow conclusions in such patient populations.  
Based on the available data, improvements in ppFEV1 were seen in the 136 F/G and 161 F/RF 
populations of 4.3% and 2.7% respectively. These improvements are observed on top of approved 
therapies as at least 90% of the patients were exposed to at least one other CFTR modulator. 
However, it appeared that patients only needed record of exposure to CFTR modulators in 2019; hence 
it is possible that some patients may not have been current users of CFTR modulators at the time of 
starting triple therapy, and as such the ‘experienced’ figures presented may be an overestimation.  
Taking into account the limitations and questions arising from the data registry, the magnitude of the 
additional response from treatment with VX445/TEZ/IVA over prior CFTR therapies is limited. It is 
unexpected that the F/G group had greater efficacy compared to the F/RF population. Indeed, in view 
of the limited efficacy observed in clinical trials for F/RFs patients treated with TEZ/IVA compared with 
patients with G/any mutations treated with IVA, it would be considered that F/RF group should have 
had more potential for improvement with VX445/TEZ/IVA by treating the F allele.   
It is however agreed that effect size estimates in these real-world analyses are not directly comparable 
to results from a clinical study in which data are collected in a controlled setting. For example, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 57/108 
 
 
 
ppFEV1 data from the pivotal clinical studies were captured and analysed after a 4-week treatment 
duration (Studies 102 and 103) and a 24-week treatment duration (Study 102). In contrast, ppFEV1 
measurements used in this analysis of CFFPR data were captured at different time points following 
initiation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment reflecting the real-world nature of data collection in routine 
clinical practice (from <28 days to over 90 days, with the mean exposure duration of 65.6 days for 
F/MF patients and 65.4 days for F/F patients, as noted above). Additionally, spirometry data collected 
in the CFFPR has greater variability because the assessment is performed at a local site using local 
equipment compared to the standardized equipment and protocols used in a clinical study.  
The CHMP considered that the registry data do not obviate the need for robust, comparative, clinical 
efficacy and safety data in F/G and F/RF patients from randomized controlled clinical studies. 
In conclusion, the cross-study comparison, responder analysis and the registry data on its own without 
the ongoing clinical trial (study 104) data in F/G and F/RF mutations do not sufficiently support the 
added benefit over approved modulator therapies. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the efficacy 
has been demonstrated only in patients with F/F and F/MF mutations where randomized clinical trial 
data are available.  
Thus, the indication for Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio was restricted to the patients with F/F and 
F/MF mutations only, reflecting the agreed indication for Kaftrio.  
Regarding the posology, it has been correctly reflected in 4.2, the information related to special 
population has also been updated, in particular hepatic impairment (sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 
SmPC), The use of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio in case of concomitant use with moderate or 
strong CYP3A4 is also amended in section 4.2. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The final indication granted by CHMP is as follows:  
‘Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 75 mg/tezacaftor 50 
mg/elexacaftor 100 mg tablets for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older 
with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or heterozygous 
for F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation.’ 
Sections 4.2, 4.4 have been amended and results have been added in section 5.1. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety data submitted in this application are identical to the Kaftrio application 
(EMEA/H/C/005269/0000). The data are provided below. 
The clinical safety database included 10 clinical studies with VX-445 as a monotherapy or as part of a 
TC regimen, including 5 completed Phase 1 studies (Study 002 (OC DDI), 003 (ADME), 005 (FDC BA), 
006(DDI) and 009 (QT/QTc), 1 completed Phase 1/2 study (Study 001), 2 completed Phase 3 studies 
(102 and 103), and 2 ongoing Phase 3 studies (study 105 - long term safety and study and 106 -
safety and PK). 
Core Safety Analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 58/108 
 
 
 
The core safety analyses in CF subjects evaluated data from Study 102, Study 103, and an interim 
analysis (IA2) of the open-label extension Study 105.  
Safety data from Studies 102 and 103 were not pooled in the core safety analysis because of the 
substantial differences in the designs of the 2 studies. These differences involve especially treatment 
duration, use of different comparator groups i.e. a placebo group in Study 102 and an active 
comparator in study 103.  Because of these differences, pooling the data could confound the 
comparison between VX-445/TEZ/IVA and placebo in Study 102.

The Study 102 Safety Set contains all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
The Study 103 Safety Set for the Treatment Period (hereafter the Study 103 Safety Set) 
includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Study 103 Treatment 
Period (i.e., does not include subjects who were only dosed in the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period). 
The Study 105 Safety Set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in 
Study 105. 
The Cumulative Safety Set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA during the parent Studies 102 or 103 and/or during Study 105. 
−  Selected safety analyses were performed for the subset of subjects in the Cumulative 
Safety Set who received ≥48 weeks of treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. 
In addition, supportive safety analyses are submitted for various doses of VX-445 and multiple 
treatment regimens (different TC regimens) in study 001 and ongoing Study 106 in CF subjects 6 
through 11 years of age.  
Patient exposure 
The mean exposure duration to VX-445/TEZ/IVA was 23.6 weeks in Study 102, 4.0 weeks in Study 
103 and 21.5 weeks in Study 105.  
Over 700 unique subjects received at least 1 dose of VX-445 as monotherapy or as part of a TC 
regimen.  
The Study 105 IA2 Safety Set included 506 subjects, who had a mean exposure duration of 37.2 
weeks, representing 392.2 patient-years of exposure. The Cumulative Safety Set included 510 subjects 
who had a mean exposure duration of 46.7 weeks, representing 496.6 patient-years of exposure. A 
subset of 271 subjects received ≥48 weeks of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment and had a mean exposure of 
57.2 weeks.

a Number of subjects in the Cumulative Safety Period with exposure of ≥48 to ≤72 weeks. 
Notes: Total exposure was defined as the sum total of the VX-445/TEZ/IVA exposure across all subjects in the applicable IA2 
Safety Set (Study 105 or Cumulative). Duration of VX-445/TEZ/IVA exposure (weeks) = ([last dose date – first dose date] in the 
applicable Treatment-emergent Period + 1)/7, regardless of any interruptions in dosing. For subjects who were still on VX-
445/TEZ/IVA at the IA2 data cutoff date, this date was used as the last dose date to calculate the duration of VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
exposure. Duration of 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA exposure (years) = duration of VX-445/TEZ/IVA exposure (weeks)/48; 1 year = 48 weeks. 
The safety profile of VX-445 in combination with TEZ/IVA was derived primarily from Study 102, a 24-
week, placebo-controlled study in CF subjects, with the largest exposed population and the longest 
treatment duration. In addition, safety data from the second interim analysis (IA2) of the ongoing OLE 
Study 105 (as of the data cut-off date of 31 October 2019) has been submitted.  
Adverse events  
The safety profile of VX-445 in combination with TEZ/IVA was derived primarily from Study 102.  
The overview of AEs in Study 102 Safety Set, and Study 105 Safety Set (OLE) is presented. The details 
are provided per safety set.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
The incidence of subjects with at least 1 AE was 93.1% in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 96.0% in the 
placebo group. Twenty-eight (13.9%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 42 (20.9%) subjects 
in the placebo group had serious AEs (SAEs). The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or 
moderate in severity. Nineteen (9.4%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 10 (5.0%) subjects 
in the placebo group interrupted study drug due to AEs. Two (1.0%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group and no subjects in the placebo group discontinued study drug due to AEs. There were no deaths, 
and no subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had life-threatening AEs.

The incidence of subjects with at least 1 AE was 58.2% in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 63.5% in the 
TEZ/IVA group. Two (3.6%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (1.9%) subject in the 
TEZ/IVA group had SAEs. The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity. No 
subjects had AEs that led to study drug interruption or discontinuation. There were no deaths or life-
threatening AEs. 
Study 105  
In the IA2, 471 (93.1%) subjects had at least 1 AE and 80 (15.8%) subjects had at least 1 serious 
adverse event (SAE). The majority AEs were mild or moderate in severity; 2 (0.4%) subjects had life-
threatening AEs. Twenty-nine (5.7%) subjects interrupted VX-445/TEZ/IVA due to AEs, and 7 (1.4%) 
subjects discontinued VX-445/TEZ/IVA due to AEs. There were no deaths. 
Table 29 Overview of AEs (Study 102 Safety Set and Study 105 Safety Set IA2)  
Cumulative Safety Set 
In IA2, the Cumulative Safety Set included safety data from all 510 subjects. A total of 488 (95.7%) 
subjects had at least 1 AE. The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity. 
Two (0.4%) subjects had life-threatening AEs. SAEs were reported in 93 (18.2%) subjects. Ten (2.0%) 
subjects discontinued VX-445/TEZ/IVA due to AEs.

In IA2, a total of 265 (97.8%) subjects had at least 1 AE. The exposure-adjusted event rates for the 
majority of AEs were similar or lower than in the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. The majority of 
subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity (63 mild (23.2%), 161 moderate (59.4%), 41 
severe (15.1%)). There were no life-threatening AEs.   
A total of 50 (18.5%) subjects had at least 1 SAE. The exposure-adjusted rates for SAEs were similar 
or lower than in the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group.  
No subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation; 26 (9.6%) subjects had AEs that led to 
treatment interruption. 
Overview of AEs in Healthy Subjects 
In the pooled analysis of Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects, 43 (22.5%) subjects in the Any VX-445 
group and 13 (24.1%) subjects in the placebo group had at least 1 AE. In both groups, the majority of 
AEs were mild in severity; there were no SAEs or deaths. One (1.9%) subject in the placebo group had 
a severe AE.  
There were 2 (1.0%) subjects in the Any VX-445 group and 1 (1.9%) subject in the placebo group who 
had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. There were no AEs that led to treatment interruption in 
any group. 
Common AEs 
The AEs with an incidence of ≥5% of Study 102 Safety Set, and Study 105 Safety Set (OLE) is 
presented in Table 31. The details are provided per safety set.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
Overall, the AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with common 
illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age and older. 
AEs occurring in ≥8% of subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with an incidence ≥1% higher than in 
the placebo group were headache, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, alanine 
transaminase (ALT) increased, aspartate transaminase (AST) increased, blood creatine phosphokinase 
increased, nasal congestion, rash, and rhinorrhoea; each occurred in ≤20% of subjects in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group.  
Among the AEs with an incidence of ≥5% in any group, AEs occurring in < 8% of subjects in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group with an incidence ≥1% higher than in the placebo group were, sinusitis, rhinitis, 
influenza, and blood bilirubin increased.  
Blood bilirubin increased was observed with VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment; this finding is consistent with 
the OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporter inhibition effect by VX-445.  
The study was conducted through the winter season, and most of the AEs of influenza occurred during 
that time. In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, none of the AEs of influenza were considered related to study 
drug and all subjects continued study drug dosing, except 2 subjects who resumed treatment after an 
interruption.  
Lastly, there was a lower rate of AEs reported in the infections and infestations SOC overall in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group compared with the placebo group.

CF subjects 12 years of age and older. Overall, results from the Cumulative Safety Set were consistent 
with the safety data from parent Studies 102 and 103, as well as for Study 105. 
Subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
In the set of subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks, 57 (98.3%) subjects had at 
least 1 AE. In IA2, a total of 265 (97.8%) subjects had at least 1 AE. The AEs were mostly consistent 
with common manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age 
and older or with the safety profile for VX-445/TEZ/IVA of study 102 and study 105.

Study 103 Safety Set 
Twelve (21.8%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 9 (17.3%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group 
had at least 1 event considered related or possibly related to study drug. One (1.8%) subject in the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (1.9%) subject in the TEZ/IVA group had an AE assessed by the 
investigator as related. Eleven (20.0%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 8 (15.4%) subjects 
in the TEZ/IVA group had an AE assessed by the investigator as possibly related.  
The most frequent related in order of highest frequency is respiration abnormal (5.5%) while all other 
events were only observed in 1 or 2 patients.  
In TEZ/IVA group following possibly related or related events were observed: AST increased, cough, 
Sputum increased, haemoptysis, rhinorrhoea, infective PEx, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, Rectal 
haemorrhage, fatigue, headache, rash (2).  
In VX-445/TEZ/IVA group cough (2), respiration abnormal (3), oropharyngeal pain (2), sputum 
increase (2), haemoptysis, increased bronchial secretion, rhinorrhoea, sputum discoloured, Sputum

Study 102 Safety Set 
The majority of subjects overall had AEs that were mild (29.8%) or moderate (56.3%) in severity. 
In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 19 (9.4%) subjects had severe AEs and no subjects had life-threatening 
AEs. In the placebo group, 14 (7.0%) subjects had severe AEs and 1 (0.5%) subject had a life-
threatening AE of neuroglycopenia. 
Study 105 Safety Set 
In IA2, 51 (10.1%) subjects had severe (Grade 3) AEs and 2 (0.4%) subjects had life-threatening 
(Grade 4) AEs. The exposure-adjusted event rate for Grade 3/4 AEs was lower in Study 105 than in 
the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (19.84 versus 27.95 events/100PY).  
Brief descriptions of the 2 subjects who had life-threatening AEs are provided below.  
•  One subject with a medical history of depression had a life-threatening AE of suicide attempt, 
which was considered by the investigator to be not related to VX-445/TEZ/IVA. The event 
resolved without change to VX-445/TEZ/IVA dosing.

Study 103 Safety Set 
The majority of AEs in both the VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA groups were mild (41.1%) or moderate 
(18.7%) in severity. No subject in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (1.9%) subject in the TEZ/IVA 
group had a severe AE (musculoskeletal pain). There were no life-threatening AEs. 
Cumulative Safety Set 
Two (0.4%) subjects had life-threatening AEs (as in Study 105).  
Subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity (63 mild (23.2%), 161 
moderate (59.4%).   
A total of 41 (15.1%) subjects had at least 1 AE that was Grade 3 or 4 in severity. Grade 3/4 events 
that occurred in ≥2 subjects were infective PEx of CF (10 subjects), blood creatine phosphokinase 
increased (8 subjects), DIOS (4 subjects), AST increased (4 subjects), ALT increased (3 subjects), GGT 
increased (2 subjects), gastritis (2 subjects), and influenza (2 subjects).  
There were no life-threatening AEs. 
The majority of events were assessed by the investigator as unrelated (not related or unlikely related) 
to VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment and generally resolved without changes to study drug dosing.  
The overall exposure-adjusted rate for Grade 3/4 AEs was similar between the population who received 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks as of Study 105 IA2 and the placebo group in Study 102 (21.07 
and 23.02 events per 100PY, respectively.

The SAEs of at least 2 subjects in Study 102 Safety Set, and Study 105 IA2 Safety Set (OLE) are 
presented in Table 36. The details are provided per safety set.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
Twenty-eight (13.9%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 42 (20.9%) subjects in the placebo 
group had at least 1 SAE.  
Overall, the SAEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with common 
illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age and older. 
SAEs that occurred in ≥2 subjects in any group and were more common in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group 
than the placebo group included rash and influenza. Rash events are further discussed below. The 3 
SAEs of influenza in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group were all assessed by the investigator as not related to 
study drug. 
The majority of SAEs were assessed by the investigator as unlikely related or not related to study 
drug.

SAEs that occurred in ≥2 subjects are summarized in Table 37. 
Table 37 Serious AEs Occurring in At Least 2 Subjects by PT: Study 105 Safety Set
Study 103 Safety Set 
In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 2 (3.6%) subjects had SAEs: 1 subject had an SAE of infective 
pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF and 1 subject had an SAE of rash. In the TEZ/IVA group, 1 (1.9%) 
subject had an SAE of infective PEx of CF. 
Cumulative Safety Set 
SAEs were reported in 72 (14.1%) subjects. SAEs that occurred in > 2 subjects were infective PEx of 
CF, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, haemoptysis, influenza, and rash. In IA2, additionally 
vascular device infection, ALT increased, and AST increased occurred. All other SAEs occurred in a 
single subject each. 
Safety in subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
In IA2, 50 (18.5%) subjects had at least 1 SAE. SAEs that occurred in ≥2 subjects were infective PEx

Related serious adverse events  
Study 102 Safety Set, Study 105 IA2 Safety Set, Cumulative Safety Set  
Cumulatively across the parent Studies 102 and 103 and Study 105 IA2, 20 (3.9%) subjects who 
received any VX-445/TEZ/IVA had related SAEs: 6 subjects with related SAEs in Study 102, and 1 
subject with a related SAE in Study 103 and 13 subjects with related SAEs in Study 105.  
Related SAEs that occurred in ≥2 subjects in the Cumulative TC Safety Period were haemoptysis, rash, 
distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), infective PEx of CF, alanine transaminase (ALT)

increased, and aspartate transaminase (AST) increased; all other related SAEs occurred in 1 subject 
each. 
Overall, the incidence of related SAEs was low across studies. The majority of these events were 
consistent with common manifestations and complications of CF disease or with the established safety 
profile for VX-445/TEZ/IVA. Many of these events had plausible alternative aetiologies and/or 
confounding factors (e.g., pre-existing medical history, concurrent infections or illnesses), and most of 
the subjects were able to maintain or successfully resume study drug dosing.

Events of specific interest 
Prespecified events of special interest are transaminase elevation events and rash events. Data 
relevant to the assessment of blood bilirubin and creatine kinase are also discussed. 
Transaminase Elevations 
Liver function test (LFT) elevations have been seen in CF patients, including some receiving IVA 
monotherapy, TEZ/IVA, and VX-445/TEZ/IVA. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of liver-related 
data in VX-445 clinical studies was performed. 
The Liver function test (LFT) elevations in Study 102 Safety Set, and Study 105 IA2 Safety Set (OLE) 
are presented in Table 39. The details are provided per safety set.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
Twenty-two (10.9%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 8 (4.0%) subjects in the placebo 
group had at least 1 elevated transaminase event. The majority of events were mild or moderate in 
severity and were associated with ALT/AST elevations <5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN).  
There were no elevated transaminase events that led to treatment discontinuation. Two (1.0%) 
subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (1.5%) subjects in the placebo group had elevated 
transaminase events that led to treatment interruption: 1 of the subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group 
resumed treatment; the other subject enrolled in the open-label extension study while still on study 
drug interruption and eventually discontinued from the open-label extension study without resuming 
study drug.  
No subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 1 subject (0.5%) in the placebo group had a serious 
elevated transaminase event. 
The median time to onset of first elevated transaminase event was 57.0 days (range: 1, 176) in the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 58.0 days (range: 1, 169) in the placebo group. The median duration of 
elevated transaminase events was 17.0 days (range: 4,153) in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 17.0 
days (range: 5, 52) in the placebo group. 
Additional relevant hepatic AEs occurred in 3 (1.5%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (hepatic 
cirrhosis, hepatocellular injury, and portal hypertension) and 1 (0.5%) subject in the placebo group 
(hepatocellular injury). Events in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The event of portal hypertension was an SAE in a subject with a medical history of hepatic 
cirrhosis that led to discontinuation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment; it was assessed by the 
investigator as being of moderate severity and possibly related to study drug. 
The event of hepatocellular injury was a non-serious AE that was associated with mildly 
elevated transaminases (<2 × ULN) and was assessed by the investigator as being of mild 
severity and related to study drug. There was no change to study drug dosing. 
The event of hepatic cirrhosis was a non-serious AE that was associated with mildly elevated 
transaminases (<2 × ULN) and was assessed by the investigator as being of mild severity and 
unlikely related to study drug. There was no change to study drug dosing. 
The AE of hepatocellular injury in the placebo group was associated with transaminase 
elevations >8 × ULN and resulted in study drug interruption. 
Mean concentrations of transaminase parameters were variable over time in both groups. In the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group, increases from baseline in mean ALT and AST were observed. The mean (SD) 
increases in ALT ranged from 4.8 (20.5) U/L at Week 16 to 8.2 (28.9) U/L at Week 24. The mean (SD) 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020

increases in AST ranged from 3.2 (13.5) U/L at Week 16 to 6.6 (31.6) U/L at Week 24. In the placebo 
group, there were no trends in ALT or AST.  
An overview of subjects with ALT and/or AST elevations by predefined thresholds and of subjects with 
ALT and/or AST elevations >3 × ULN and total bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN is presented in Table 39. 
The ALT/AST and bilirubin elevations did not have to be concurrent and could occur at any time in the 
Treatment-emergent Period, regardless of baseline levels. 
The majority of subjects had ALT and AST values that remained within the normal range. More 
subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had ALT or AST >3×, 5× and 8× ULN, respectively, compared 
to subjects in the placebo group. No subject had elevations of ALT or AST >3 × ULN concurrent with a 
newly occurring elevation in total bilirubin >2 × ULN. Two subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had 
ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN during the study; in 1 subject, the elevations were 
not concurrent (ALT and AST >3 × ULN occurred at the Day 15 Visit; total bilirubin >2 × ULN occurred 
at the Week 24 Visit). The other subject had a medical history of Gilbert’s syndrome and an elevated 
total bilirubin at screening >2 × ULN that remained high throughout the study.

Study 103 Safety Set 
Two (3.6%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (1.9%) subject in the TEZ/IVA group had at 
least 1 elevated transaminase event. All events were mild in severity, and none were serious or led to 
treatment discontinuation or interruption.  
Increases from baseline in mean (SD) ALT and AST were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (9.0 
(16.5) U/L for ALT and 1.6 (13.9) U/L for AST), but not in the TEZ/IVA group (-3.1 (13.1) U/L for ALT 
and -2.0 (8.4) for AST). 
The incidences of maximum transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) >3 ×, >5 ×, or >8 × ULN in the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group were 7.3%, 3.6%, and 0%, respectively. No subjects in the TEZ/IVA group had 
ALT or AST elevations >3 × ULN or ALT or AST >3 × ULN with total bilirubin >2 × ULN.

subject had ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN during the study (not concurrent).  
One additional subject had AST and ALT >3 × ULN concurrent with bilirubin >2 × ULN due to an SAE 
of acute cholecystitis, that were not captured in the clinical database nor included in the Study 105 IA 
tables and listings. This subject recovered quickly following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and ALT, 
AST, and bilirubin parameters returned to the subject’s baseline levels (<2 × ULN).  
Overall, the data related to transaminase elevations in Study 105 were consistent with those in the 
parent studies. (Table 40)

Cumulative Safety Set 
Ten (2.0%) subjects discontinued VX-445/TEZ/IVA due to AEs, with 4 (0.8%) subjects discontinuing 
due to LFT elevations and 2 (0.4%) subjects discontinuing due to rash events.  
Subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
Elevated transaminase AEs occurred in 36 (13.3%) subjects, no events were serious.  
Laboratory elevations in ALT and/or AST >3 ×, 5 ×, and >8 × ULN occurred in 30 (11.1%) subjects, 7 
(2.6%) subjects, and 4 (1.5%) subjects. No subjects had elevations of ALT or AST >3 × ULN 
concurrent with a newly occurring elevation in total bilirubin >2 × ULN. Three (1.1%) subjects had ALT 
or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN during Studies 102 or 105; in 2 subjects, the elevations 
were not concurrent. The third subject had a medical history of Gilbert’s syndrome and an elevated 
total bilirubin at screening >2 × ULN that remained high throughout the study. 
Pooled Analysis of Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects 
No subjects had transaminase elevation events. There were no trends in mean ALT or AST in the Phase 
1 studies. In the Any VX-445 group, 1 (0.5%) subject had AST >3 × to ≤5 × ULN at the Safety 
Follow-up Visit. 
Bilirubin Elevation Events 
Blood bilirubin is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and VX-445 is an OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
inhibitor based on in vitro results; as such, blood bilirubin levels could be increased with VX-
445/TEZ/IVA treatment.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
AEs of bilirubin elevation occurred in 10 (5.0%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (1.0%) 
subjects in the placebo group. 
None of the AEs of bilirubin elevation were serious or led to treatment discontinuation. One subject in 
the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had an AE of blood bilirubin increased that led to treatment interruption; 
the AE resolved, and study drug was resumed. 
Increases from baseline in mean total bilirubin (up to 4.0 μmol/L) were observed in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group, with a greater increase in indirect bilirubin (up to 2.7 μmol/L) than in direct 
bilirubin (up to 1.3 μmol/L; Study 102 CSR/Table 14.3.4.1); however, the mean values of the 3 
bilirubin parameters were within normal range throughout the study. The bilirubin elevation was 
observed at Day 15 and remained at a similar level for the rest of the study. In the placebo group, 
changes from baseline in mean total bilirubin were minimal. 
The majority of subjects had bilirubin values that remained within the normal range. In the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group, 8 (4.0%) subjects had elevations in total bilirubin >2 × ULN of which one subject 
>2 × ULN. Threshold analyses for direct bilirubin and indirect bilirubin showed a similar pattern of 
elevations with that observed in the mean value analyses. In the placebo group, 1 (0.5%) subject had 
elevations in total bilirubin >2 × ULN.  
Study 103 Safety Set 
No subjects had AEs of bilirubin elevation. Increases from baseline in mean total bilirubin were 
observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with a greater increase in indirect bilirubin than in direct 
bilirubin; however, the mean values of the 3 bilirubin parameters were within normal range throughout 
the study. The greatest mean (SD) change in total bilirubin (3.0 (2.9) μmol/L) was observed at Week 
4, compared to placebo -0.6 (2.3) μmol/L.

Study 105 Safety Set 
AEs of bilirubin elevation occurred in 23 (4.5%) subjects. Nineteen (3.8%) subjects had elevations in 
total bilirubin >2 × ULN. Threshold analyses for other bilirubin parameters showed a similar pattern of 
elevations with that observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group of Study 102: the incidence of >2 × ULN 
elevations was higher for indirect bilirubin (26 subjects [5.1%]) than direct bilirubin (1 subject 
[0.2%]). Overall, the bilirubin data in Study 105 were consistent with those in the parent studies 
(Studies 102 and 103).  
In the Pooled Analysis of Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects, no subjects had AEs of bilirubin 
elevation. Increases in mean total bilirubin were observed in 2 of the Phase 1 studies in healthy 
subjects, with a greater increase in indirect bilirubin than in direct bilirubin.  
Rash Events 
In the Phase 1 DDI study in healthy female subjects taking VX-445/TEZ/IVA and oral hormonal 
contraceptives (Study 002), 4 of 15 subjects (26.7%) had a rash event. Therefore, rash was 
considered an event of special interest in the Phase 3 studies.  
The Treatment-emergent Rash Events in Study 102 Safety Set, and Study 105 IA2 Safety Set (OLE) 
are presented in Table 41. The details are provided per safety set.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
Twenty-two (10.9%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 13 (6.5%) subjects in the placebo 
group had a least 1 rash event. The majority of events were mild or moderate in severity. 
One (0.5%) subject in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had a rash event that led to treatment 
discontinuation. Four (2.0%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (0.5%) subject in the 
placebo group had events that led to treatment interruption; all resumed treatment. 
Serious rash events occurred in 3 (1.5%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (2 SAEs of rash, 1 
SAE of rash pruritic), of which 2 events were considered treatment related; all events resolved. In the 
placebo group, 1 (0.5%) subject had a serious rash event. 
The median time to onset of first rash event was 13.5 days (range: 5, 157) in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group and 27.0 days (range: 1, 157) in the placebo group. The median duration of rash events was 
7.0 days (range: 1, 92) in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 8.0 days (range: 2, 61) in the placebo 
group. 
The incidence of rash events was higher in females than in males in both treatment groups. In the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 16 (16.3%) female subjects and 6 (5.8%) male subjects had rash events. In 
the placebo group, 8 (8.3%) female subjects and 5 (4.8%) male subjects had rash events. 
In female subjects receiving VX-445/TEZ/IVA, 8 (20.5%) subjects who used hormonal therapy during 
the study and 8 (13.6%) subjects not using hormonal therapy had rash events. In female subjects 
receiving placebo, 3 (9.4%) subjects who used hormonal therapy during the study and 
5 (7.8%) subjects not using hormonal therapy had rash events. 
Of the 8 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group who used hormonal therapy and had a rash event, 1 
subject had a rash event before beginning hormonal therapy use; 4 subjects had no changes to study 
drug or hormonal therapy, and the rash resolved; 2 subjects had VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment 
interruptions, discontinued hormonal therapy, and resumed study drug after the rash resolved; and 
1 subject remained on hormonal therapy and discontinued VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment, and the rash 
resolved.

Study 103 Safety Set 
In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 2 (3.6%) subjects had a rash event; both were female. One rash event 
occurred in a subject who had concomitant use of hormonal therapy; this event was considered serious 
and possibly related to study drug. The subject discontinued use of OCs and continued study drug 
treatment, and the rash resolved.  
In the TEZ/IVA group, 2 (3.8%) subjects had a nonserious rash event; both were female, and 
1 subject had concomitant use of hormonal therapy. 
All rash events were mild in severity, and none led to treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
Study 105 Safety Set 
In Study 105, in IA2 50 (9.9%) subjects had rash events. The rash events were exanthematous and 
mostly mild to moderate in severity. A serious rash event occurred in 1 (0.2%) subject; study drug 
was discontinued, and the event resolved. Five (1.0%) subjects had rash events that led to treatment 
interruption.  
The incidence of rash events was higher in females than in males: 27 (10.8%) female subjects and 23 
(9.0%) male subjects had rash events. Of the 94 female subjects taking hormonal therapy during the 
study, 12 (12.8%) had rash events; of the 157 female subjects not taking hormonal therapy during 
the study, 15 (9.6%) had rash events. Overall, the nature and severity of the rash events in Study 105 
were consistent with those in the parent studies (Studies 102 and 103).

Safety in subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
In IA2, rash events occurred in 42 (15.5%) subjects; these events were generally exanthematous 
rashes and mostly mild (32, 11.8%) to moderate (9, 3.3%) in severity. The exposure-adjusted event 
rate for rash events was lower in this subset of subjects in Study 105 than in the Study 102 VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group (18.90 versus 29.95 events/100PY). Three (1.1%) subjects had rash events that 
were serious. Four (1.5%) subjects had rash events that led to treatment interruption.  
Pooled Analysis of Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects 
In the Any VX-445 group, 7 (3.7%) subjects had rash events, of whom 2 (1.0%) subjects discontinued 
study drug due to a rash event. All rash events were mild or moderate in severity and nonserious. The 
median time to onset of rash events was 11.0 days (range: 10 to 19 days).  
Of the 7 subjects who had rash events in the Any VX-445 group, 4 were female subjects from Study 
002 (OC DDI), and 3 were male subjects. The incidence of rash events in female subjects in Study 002 
was 4 of 15 subjects (26.7%). 
In the placebo group, 1 (1.9%) subject had 2 rash events of dermatitis. The time to onset of the first 
event was 9 days. 
CK Elevation Events 
Study 102 Safety Set 
AEs of CK elevation occurred in 20 (9.9%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (18 with AEs of blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased, 1 with an AE of rhabdomyolysis, and 1 with both AE) and 
9 (4.5%) subjects in the placebo group (9 with AEs of blood creatine phosphokinase increased and 
1 also with an AE of rhabdomyolysis). The majority of subjects with CK elevation events had 
asymptomatic laboratory elevations, many of which were preceded by exercise. The AEs were mostly 
mild or moderate; AEs were of severe intensity in 5 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and no 
subjects in the placebo group. One subject in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had an SAE of CK elevation 
(rhabdomyolysis). 
The 2 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with AEs of rhabdomyolysis presented with CK elevations, 
and neither subject had clinical features of rhabdomyolysis (e.g., kidney involvement, myoglobinuria). 
Before event onset, both subjects had performed strenuous exercise (power lifting and CrossFit). Both 
subjects resumed treatment following interruption. The 1 subject in the placebo group with an AE of 
rhabdomyolysis had increased CK as well as elevated blood myoglobin. Narratives for subjects who had 
AEs of rhabdomyolysis are provided. 
AEs of CK elevation led to study drug interruption in 3 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and no 
subjects in the placebo group. Most AEs of CK elevation in both treatment groups resolved without 
change to study drug dosing or after treatment interruption. No subjects discontinued treatment due 
to AEs of CK elevation in either treatment group.  
The mean CK concentration was variable over time in both groups. In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 
increases from baseline in mean CK were observed. The mean (SD) increases in CK ranged from 
35.9 (245.6) U/L at Week 12 to 108.2 (650.2) U/L at Week 24. In the placebo group, there were no 
trends in CK. 
The majority of subjects had CK levels that remained within the normal range. Twenty-
one (10.4%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had CK >5 × ULN, including 10 (5.0%) subjects 
with CK >10 × ULN. Ten subjects (5.0%) in the placebo group had CK >5 × ULN, including 3 subjects 
(1.5%) with CK >10 × ULN. The majority of subjects with elevations >10 × ULN had exercised before 
the elevations.

Study 103 Safety Set 
No subjects had AEs of CK elevation. 
Increases from baseline in mean and median CK were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. The 
greatest mean (SD) change (22.6 [171.0] U/L) was observed at Day 15. 
Study 105 Safety Set 
In Study 105, AEs of CK elevation occurred in 31 (6.1%) subjects, none of whom had AEs of 
rhabdomyolysis. The exposure-adjusted event rate for AEs of CK elevation was lower in Study 105 
than in the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (8.90 versus 19.96 events/100PY) 
The AEs were mostly mild or moderate in severity. One subject had a serious CK elevation event 
following strenuous exercise, and the SAE resolved without changes to study drug dosing. Four (0.8%) 
subjects had an AE of CK elevation that led to treatment interruption, and no subjects discontinued 
treatment due to AEs of CK elevation.  
The majority of subjects had CK levels that remained within the normal range. Forty-two (8.3%) 
subjects had CK >5 × ULN, including 16 (3.2%) subjects with CK >10 × ULN. 
Most subjects with CK elevations had asymptomatic laboratory elevations, many of which were 
preceded by exercise. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology and Coagulation 
Mean concentrations of haematology parameters were variable over time in both groups. In the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, decreases from baseline in mean platelets, leukocytes, and neutrophils were 
observed; however, mean values of all 3 parameters remained within normal limits at all assessed 
time points. These findings are not considered clinically adverse and may be markers of reduced 
systemic inflammation. There were no trends observed in other haematology parameters in either the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA or placebo group in study 102 or the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group in study 103. There were 
no trends in coagulation assessments in either group of both studies 102 and 103.  
AEs related to haematology and coagulation were infrequent; none of the AEs were serious or led to 
treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
Other Serum Chemistry 
Selected serum chemistry laboratory assessments are discussed in events of specific interest There 
were no trends in other chemistry parameters. Overall, AEs related to other chemistry parameters 
were infrequent and had a similar overall incidence between treatment groups. None of these AEs were 
serious or led to treatment discontinuation, and none led to treatment interruption in the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. 
Urinalysis 
There were no trends observed in the urinalysis results.  
Vital Signs 
In Study 102, increases from baseline in mean BP parameters were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group; increases from baseline ranged from 2.0 to 3.5 mm Hg for mean SBP and 1.1 to 1.9 mm Hg for 
mean DBP, without a trend of continued increase during the study. The proportion of subjects who had 
BP in the hypertensive range (i.e., SBP >140 mm Hg or DBP >90 mm Hg) on at least 2 occasions was 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 83/108 
 
 
 
similar between the treatment groups. There were few AEs of BP increase (1 subject in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group and 2 subjects in the placebo group). Given the similar incidence of subjects in the 
hypertensive range between treatment groups and occurrence of few AEs, the modest increase in 
mean BP in this normotensive population is unlikely to be clinically relevant. There were no meaningful 
changes in BP in Study 103 or the Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects. 
In study 105, for subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA in Study 102, there was no further increase 
in mean BP with continued VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment in Study 105. For subjects who received 
placebo in Study 102 and received VX-445/TEZ/IVA in Study 105, the increase in mean BP was 
generally similar to that observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group in Study 102. Few subjects 
(5 [1.0%] subjects) in Study 105 had AEs of increased BP; all AEs were mild in severity, and none 
required study drug interruption or discontinuation. 
In Studies 102 and 103, decreases from baseline in mean pulse rate (up to 4.3 bpm in Study 102 and 
up to 5.5 bpm in Study 103) were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. No subjects had AEs of 
decreased HR. The decrease in mean pulse rate is not considered to be clinically relevant. There were 
no meaningful changes in pulse rate in the Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects. 
In IA2, there were also 83 subjects that had tachycardia with >100 beats per minute. Among these 
subjects, tachycardia was accompanied by an increase of heartrate > 20 beats/min in 22 subjects.  
In all studies, there were no trends in temperature, respiratory rate, or pulse oximetry. 
Electrocardiogram Data 
In Studies 102 and 103, decreases from baseline in mean HR were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group. In study 102, the mean (SD) decreases in HR ranged from -3.7 (12.3) bpm at Week 16 
to -5.8 (12.4) bpm at 2 hours post-dose on Day 15. In the placebo group, changes from baseline in 
mean HR were minimal. In study 103, the greatest mean (SD) change in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (-
5.4 [8.8] bpm) was observed at Week 4 (compared to 1.9 [9.3] bpm in the TEZ/IVA group). 
AEs related to ECG findings or relevant cardiac disorders were infrequent with a similar overall 
incidence across treatment groups. None of the AEs related to ECG findings or relevant cardiac 
disorders were serious or led to treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
High-precision QT analysis (in Study 001) and a thorough QT/QTc study (Study 009) were conducted 
for VX-445 and its metabolite M23-445. Both studies showed a lack of effect of VX-445 on QTc.  
In separate thorough QT studies for the TEZ and IVA clinical development programs (Studies 661-010 
and 770-008, respectively), TEZ and IVA did not prolong the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects to 
any clinically relevant extent at doses up to 3 times the maximum recommended dose. 
Post-dose Spirometry 
Post-dose spirometry was assessed in healthy subjects at approximately 6 hours post-dose on Days 1 
and 9 in Study 001 (Parts B and C), and in CF subjects at 5 hours post-dose on Days 1 and 15 in 
Study 001 (Parts D, E, and F). There were no clinically relevant decreases in post-dose spirometry. 
Overall, the post-dose ppFEV1 values showed no evidence of decline from the pre-dose ppFEV1 at any 
assessment time points for both healthy and CF subjects. 
Ophthalmologic Examinations 
Due to nonclinical findings of cataracts/lens opacities in a study involving IVA monotherapy and the 
implementation of recommended ophthalmologic examinations in paediatric patients treated with IVA, 
ophthalmologic examinations were performed in the VX-445 clinical program in subjects <18 years of 
age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 84/108 
 
 
 
In Study 102, one (0.5%) subject in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had AEs of cataract cortical and 
lenticular opacity; this subject had a history of CF-related diabetes and concomitant use of 
corticosteroids. One (0.5%) subject in the placebo group had an AE of cataract; this subject had 
concomitant use of corticosteroids. Both AEs were mild in severity, not clinically significant, and did not 
require treatment or lead to interruption or discontinuation of study drug. In Study 103, follow-up 
ophthalmologic examinations were not required given the short study duration. 
Overall, the ophthalmological examination (OE) data are consistent with previous experience with IVA 
and IVA-containing regimens. 
Safety in special populations 
A summary of the safety profile of subjects in subgroups of F508del-CFTR mutation with F/MF and F/F 
in the cumulative safety data across Studies 102, 103, and 105. Across the F/MF and F/F subgroups, 
the majority of AEs were mild to moderate in severity, and most were consistent with common 
manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age 
and older. The most common AEs (incidence of ≥15% of subjects in any subgroup) were similar across 
the F/MF and F/F subgroups. Overall, the safety results were similar between the F/MF and F/F 
subgroups, and no new safety concerns were identified. 
The safety profile is generally also similar across subgroups of patients, including sex, ppFEV1, 
geographic regions, and genotypes. 
The safety results were generally consistent in the subgroups subjects ≥18 years of age and subjects 
≥12 to <18 years of age. There were no patients > 65 year in study 102 or study 103. 
Immunological events 
In Study 102, 4 (2.0%) subjects in each group had an immunological event. In Study 105 IA2, 22 
(4.3%) subjects had AEs in the immune system disorders SOC, mainly associated with external 
allergens (e.g., environmental, animal, food) and were not considered study drug-related. One subject 
had a nonserious AE of anaphylactic reaction that was caused by an allergic reaction to cashews. The 
event resolved without change to study drug dosing and was assessed by the investigator as not 
related to study drug.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No information on PD interactions is provided. For PK interactions, please refer to clinical 
pharmacology discussion for pharmacokinetic interactions (CYP3A inducer/inhibitor interactions). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Study 102, two subjects (both in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group) discontinued study drug due to an AE, 
one subject with a non-serious AE of rash and one subject with a medical history of hepatic cirrhosis 
because of a SAE of portal hypertension. Both events were assessed by the investigator as being of 
moderate severity and possibly related to study drug. 
In Study 103, no subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation.   
In IA2 of Study 105, 7 (1.4%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. Three subjects 
discontinued due to AEs of transaminase elevation. The other subjects discontinued treatment due to 
AEs of depression (1 subject), rash (1 subject), tinnitus and contusion (1 subject) and hepatic 
encephalopathy (1 subject). For the subject with non-serious AEs of tinnitus and contusion, study drug 
was discontinued, and the events were ongoing at time of the data cut. For the other subjects the AE 
were resolved after discontinuation of study drug. For the subject who discontinued VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
treatment due to an SAE of hepatic encephalopathy the event resolved with treatment. The subject 
had a history of hepatic cirrhosis, portal hypertension with gastric varices, and thrombocytopenia. 
In the Cumulative Safety Set, 10 (2%) subjects discontinued study drug due to AEs, with 4 (0.8%) 
subjects discontinuing due to LFT elevations and 2 (0.4%) subjects discontinuing due to rash events.   
In the set of subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks, none of the subjects were 
discontinued from study medication.  
In the Healthy Subjects, in the Any VX-445 group, 2 (1.0%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment 
discontinuation, both of which were rash events. One subject with rash generalized who received VX-
445 in Study 009, a thorough QT/QTc study and one subject with dermatitis who received VX-
445/TEZ/IVA in Study 001, a single- and multiple-dose escalation first-in-human study.  
AEs Leading to Interruption of Study Drug 
In Study 102, 29 subjects (19 subjects [9.4%] in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 10 subjects [5.0%] 
in the placebo group) interrupted study drug due to an AE. Of the 19 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group, 16 subjects resumed study drug treatment in Study 102, and 3 subjects enrolled in extension 
Study 105 while study drug was interrupted.  
In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, AEs that led to treatment interruption that occurred in ≥2 subjects were 
rash, ALT increased, infective PEx of CF, influenza, and rhabdomyolysis. In the placebo group, ALT 
increased led to treatment interruption in ≥2 subjects. 
In Study 103, no subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption.   
In Study 105, 29 (5.7%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption. Events that occurred 
in≥2 subjects were ALT increased, AST increased, rash, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, GGT 
increased, and blood creatinine phosphokinase increased. Other AEs that lead to interruption were 
pruritus generalised, abdominal pain upper, constipation, duodenitis, gastric haemorrhage, 
cholecystitis acute, depression blood bilirubin increased, liver function test increased, pityriasis rosea, 
rash maculo-papular, infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis, bacterial vaginosis, hand-
foot-and-mouth disease, tendonitis, pulmonary haemorrhage, pyrexia, burning sensation, haematuria..

Post marketing experience 
IVA monotherapy was first authorized globally in the US on 31 January 2012 for the treatment of CF 
and was subsequently authorized in multiple countries globally. Cumulatively worldwide as of 02 
September 2019, 6,511 patients (representing 17,817 person-years) were exposed to IVA in the post 
marketing setting. 
TEZ/IVA was first authorized globally in the US on 12 February 2018 for the treatment of CF and was 
subsequently authorized in multiple countries globally. Cumulatively worldwide as of 11 August 2019, 
9,652 patients (representing an estimated 6,538 person-years) were exposed to TEZ/IVA in the post 
marketing setting. 
Overall, the post marketing experience for both IVA and TEZ/IVA remains consistent with the safety 
profiles for each product that were established in clinical studies. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient population and exposure  
The core safety analyses in CF subjects evaluated data from Studies 102 and 103, and an interim 
analysis (IA2) of the open-label extension Study 105 as separate sets. Study 102 provided the main 
safety data. In addition to the core safety analyses, a Cumulative Safety Set and a subset of subjects 
in the Cumulative Safety Set who received ≥ 48 weeks of treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA were 
presented. Overall, these sets provide a sufficient overview of the safety. Study 105 is ongoing (IA1 
cut-off date 10 July 2019, IA2 cut-off date 31 October 2019). Further safety data will be provided post 
approval which was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
In the Phase 3 program, 510 subjects received at least 1 dose of VX-445/TEZ/IVA, with a total 
exposure of approximately 496.6 patient-years. In the Cumulative Safety Set (parent Studies 102 or 
103 and/or during Study 105), 12 subjects had an exposure of ≤ 24 weeks, 229 subject > 24 ≤ 48 
weeks, and 271 subjects ≥ 48 weeks. This is considered sufficient to assess long-term safety.  
Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths  
Pivotal placebo-controlled studies (Study 102 and Study 103) 
Nearly all patients in both arms in study 102 experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE (93.1% 
of patients in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm and 96.0% in the placebo arm). In study 103, these numbers 
are much lower, 58.2% in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 63.5% in the TEZ/IVA group, likely because 
of the shorter duration of this study. 
Overall,  the  AEs  were  mostly  consistent  with  common  manifestations  of  CF  disease  or  with  common 
illnesses. In study 102, AEs occurring in ≥8% of subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with an incidence 
≥1% higher than in the placebo group were headache (17.3% versus 14.9%), diarrhoea (12.9% versus 
7.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (11.9% versus 10.9%), abdominal pain (9.9% versus 6.0%), 
alanine  transaminase  (ALT)  increased  (9.9%  versus  3.5%),  aspartate  transaminase  (AST)  increased 
(9.4%  versus  2.0%),  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  increased  (9.4%  versus  4.5%),  nasal  congestion 
(9.4% versus 7.5%), rash (8.9% versus 4.5%), and rhinorrhoea (8.4% versus 3.0%).  All of these are 
included as ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Initially AEs occurring in ≥8% of subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with an incidence ≥1% higher 
than in the placebo group were considered an ADR. However, this margin was considered arbitrary and 
generous. Upon request by CHMP, additional analyses with more stringent margins were provided. Two 
additional ADRs occurred in ≥5% of subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with an incidence ≥1% higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 87/108 
 
 
 
than in the placebo group compared to the cut-off level of ≥8%, i.e. rhinitis and influenza. Compared to 
the cut-off level of >5%, 8 additional ADRs occurred in ≥3% of subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group 
with  an  incidence  ≥1%  higher  than  in  the  placebo  group,  i.e.,  abdominal  pain  upper,  flatulence, 
hypoglycaemia,  acne,  dizziness,  pruritus,  wheezing  and  abnormal  breathing.  All  of  these  have  been 
included in section 4.8 of the SmPC as ADRs. Blood pressure increased is also included in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC as an ADR.     
Results in Study 103 were reasonably similar to results in the study 102 Safety set. In Study 103, the 
incidence of subjects with at least 1 AE was lower than in Study 102 but similar in both treatment groups 
(58.2% in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 63.5% in the TEZ/IVA group). The different duration of the 
studies is likely the reason for the differences in incidence of AEs.  
In Study 102, related AEs occurred more frequently in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA (47.5%) compared to the 
placebo group (25.9%). These most frequent related in order of highest frequency are sputum 
increased (6.9%) ALT increased (5.9%), AST increased (5.4%) and rash (5.4%). These related AEs 
are also more frequent than in placebo. In study 103 Safety Set, more subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group (12 (21.8%)) had related AEs compared subjects in the placebo group (9 (17.3%)). The most 
frequent related in order of highest frequency was respiration abnormal (5.5%) while all other events 
were only observed in 1 or 2 patients.   
Overall the numbers of Grade 3 or 4 AEs were low. In study 102, 19 (9.4%) subjects had severe AEs 
and no subjects had life-threatening AEs in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, while 14 (7.0%) subjects had 
severe AEs and 1 (0.5%) subject had a life-threatening AE of neuroglycopenia in the placebo group. 
Blood creatine phosphokinase increased (2%) and alanine aminotransferase increased (1%) and 
aspartate aminotransferase increased (1%) occurred ≥ 1%. In the Study 103 Safety Set, only 1 
(1.9%) subject in the TEZ/IVA group had a severe AE (musculoskeletal pain).  
Eight cases of haemoptysis were classified as possibly related to study drug all in patients treated with 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA. Of note, an additional case of severe gastric haemorrhage (unlikely related) was 
reported. Two additional cases, one each of ocular retrobulbar haemorrhage (possibly related), 
menorrhagia (possibly related) and 3 cases of vaginal haemorrhage (not related) were reported. There 
were no clear markers of increased tendency to bleed. There was no evidence of increased 
prothrombin times, platelets decreased were reported in 6.7% of subjects but no subjects reported 
decreases ≥25 to <50 (10^9/L). Thus, no PI update was deemed necessary at this stage.  
The event rate for influenza was 3E/100PY in the placebo arm and 16E/100PY in VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm 
in Study 102, while it was 4.6E/100PY and 6.9E/100PY in the long term OLS and Cumulative safety 
analyses respectively. The difference between placebo arm and in VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm in Study 102 is 
not sufficiently explained. On the basis of this analysis, and also taking into consideration the analysis 
of AEs occurring in ≥5%, and ≥3% of subjects, Influenza is included as an ADR in section 4.8 in 
Kalydeco SmPC. The MAH committed to monitoring reporting rates of influenza in subsequent PSURs. 
In study 102, the incidence of SAEs was lower in VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (28 (13.9%)) than in the 
placebo group (42 (20.9%)). Overall, the SAEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of 
CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects. Rash and influenza occurred in ≥2 subjects in any 
group and were more common in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group than the placebo group. In study 103, 1 
subject had an SAE of infective pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF and 1 subject had an SAE of rash 
in VX-445/TEZ/IVA group while 1 (1.9%) subject had an SAE of infective PEx of CF in the TEZ/IVA 
group.  
No deaths were reported in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA clinical development program.

The long-term safety Study 105 Safety Set and Cumulative safety Set showed decreased incidences of 
(related) AEs, Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation with VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
compared to Study 102 Safety Set.  
The (related) AEs and SAE were mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with 
common illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age and older. A total of 169 (33.4%) subjects had AEs 
considered related or possibly related to VX-445/TEZ/IVA. In addition to already observed related AE 
in study 103, photosensitivity reaction was observed in 7 subjects, but all resolved with continued 
study drug treatment. Furthermore, the exposure-adjusted event rate for the AE of photosensitivity 
reaction overall was similar in Study 105 and in the placebo group of Study 102. Taking these 
arguments into account there is insufficient information to include photosensitivity as and ADR. 
Nevertheless, photosensitivity will be reviewed in subsequent PSURs. 
The exposure-adjusted event rates for the majority of AEs were similar or lower in Study 105 than in 
the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group apart from cough, fatigue, haemoptysis and sinus congestion 
that occurred more frequently in Study 105.   
In Study 105, 51 (10.1%) subjects had severe (Grade 3) AEs and 2 (0.4%) subjects had life-
threatening (Grade 4) AEs. Only pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (3.2%) occurred >1% as 
Grade 3 and 4 AE. The two life-threatening AEs were an event of non-related suicide attempt and an 
event pulmonary haemorrhage, which was considered to be possibly related to VX-445/TEZ/IVA.  
In both the overall cumulative analysis and the 48-week cumulative exposure analysis, Exposure-
adjusted analyses of event rates in Study 102 showed a decrease in the rates of the majority of related 
AEs with longer-term treatment compared with Study 105. 
In the set of subjects who receive VX-445 for at least 48 weeks, 41 (15.1%) subjects had at least 1 AE 
that was Grade 3 or 4 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 events that occurred in ≥2 subjects were infective PEx 
of CF (10 subjects), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (8 subjects), DIOS (4 subjects), AST 
increased (4 subjects), ALT increased (3 subjects), GGT increased (2 subjects), gastritis (2 subjects), 
and influenza (2 subjects).  
The safety profile of subjects in subgroups of F508del-CFTR mutation with F/MF and F/F in the 
cumulative safety set was broadly comparable across the F/MF and F/F subgroups respectively.  
Adverse events of special interest  
Transaminase elevations are common in CF and have been observed in patients receiving IVA 
monotherapy, TEZ/IVA, and VX-445/TEZ/IVA. In the pivotal VX-445/TEZ/IVA, exclusion criteria for 
patients with pre-existing liver function impairments were more stringent compared to the Orkambi  
and Symkevi clinical studies. In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA studies, patients were excluded when 1 out of the 
defined impairments were present instead of 2 (Symkevi) or 3 (Orkambi) trial.  
In Study 102, the incidence of transaminase elevation adverse events was 2-3 times higher in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group. The vast majority of the events were non-severe, non-
serious and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. In addition, only one event of portal 
hypertension in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA was a SAE, occurring in a subject with a history of hepatic 
cirrhosis, that led to discontinuation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment.  
Results from Study 103 and Study 105 were generally consistent with those from Study 102. In 
addition, increases from baseline in mean total bilirubin were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 
with a greater increase in indirect bilirubin than direct bilirubin. In the placebo group, changes from 
baseline in mean total bilirubin were minimal. AEs associated with bilirubin elevation occurred in 10 
(5.0%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (1.0%) subjects in the placebo group. One 
subject had an AE of bilirubin elevation that was not serious and led to treatment interruption. Rash

events have been seen in subjects treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA including in the Phase 1. In Study 
102, there was a higher incidence of rash events in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (10.9%, 22 subjects) 
than in the placebo group (6.5%, 13 subjects). Most rashes occurred within the first 3 weeks of study 
drug treatment. Serious rash events occurred in 3 (1.5%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 
while in 1 (0.5%) subject in the placebo group. There was also an increase in the incidence of rash in 
female subjects taking hormonal therapy compared with those not taking hormonal therapy; the 
increase was larger in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group. Therefore, a role for 
hormonal therapy in the occurrence of rash cannot be excluded. This has been adequately addressed 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
AEs of CK elevation occurred more frequently in subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group compared to the 
placebo group. The majority were asymptomatic laboratory elevations, many of which were preceded by 
exercise.  Most  AEs  of  CK  elevation  resolved  without  change  to  study  drug  dosing  or  after  treatment 
interruption. The 2 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with AEs of rhabdomyolysis presented with 
CK  elevations,  and  neither  subject  had  clinical  features  of  rhabdomyolysis  (e.g.,  kidney  involvement, 
myoglobinuria). Both subjects had performed strenuous exercise (power lifting and CrossFit), which was 
likely the cause of the CK elevations. A warning regarding increased CK is included in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC.  
No clinically meaningful trends in the respiratory-related AEs or postdose spirometry data were 
observed during phase I in healthy volunteers and CF patients at the proposed dose.  
In Study 102, small increases from baseline in SBP and DBP were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group were observed. This has been adequately captured in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Safety in special populations  
No patients in the Phase 3 clinical studies were aged 65 years or older at screening. This is acceptable 
when considering the severity of the disease and life-expectancy in the investigated CF mutations 
(homozygote F508del and heterozygote F508del/MF).  
The safety profile of Kaftrio in combination with Kalydeco is generally also similar across subgroups of 
patients, including sex, ppFEV1, geographic regions, and genotypes. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
No clinically relevant differences in safety profile of VX-445/TEZ/IVA between patients ≥12 to <18 
years of age and ≥18 years of age have been observed. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Kalydeco alone and in combination therapy with other CFTR modulators is 
sufficiently characterised with extensive post marketing experience. 
Additionally, the clinical studies submitted for the extension of indication of Kalydeco in association 
with Kaftrio are adequate.  
Overall, the combination treatment of Ivacaftor and Kaftrio was well tolerated with low discontinuation 
rates due to AEs. In the clinical studies performed with Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor, an 
increase in hepatic toxicity, influenza and rash were identified. These safety events have been 
introduced in the SmPC of Ivacaftor. They can be handled in the clinical practice and have been 
adequately described in the SmPC.  
A warning on the occurrence of rash events is introduced in section 4.4.

The safety profile has been adequately characterised and the safety of Kalydeco in combination with 
Kaftrio will be further monitored in the PSURs in the post marketing setting

CYP: cytochrome P450, PL: Patient Leaflet; SmPC: Summary of Product Characteristics 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Additionally, minor amendments are introduced in the PI according to QRD template version 10.1. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
- 
The package leaflet (PL) for ivacaftor (Kalydeco) was user tested in 2012 (tablets PL) and the 
2015 (granules PL).  
-  A bridging report was submitted and accepted as part of a Type II variation in 2017, after the 
addition of text relating to co-administration of Kalydeco with Symkevi. This included 
differences in the indication, advice on co-administration. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 93/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface that regulates 
salt and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride results in the accumulation of 
thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal 
absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. Lung disease is the 
primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF.  
F508del, is the most common disease-causing mutation (84.7% of the individuals in the US and 81.1% 
of the individuals in Europe)2,3. With the proposed indication, this would result in treatment possibility 
in a large majority of the patients.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Two types of CF therapies exist. The use CF therapies that target the symptoms of the disease (such 
as nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics), in combination with CFTR modulators (i.e. 
correctors and potentiators) is recommended to maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of 
infections and exacerbations, and improve quality of life. 
Correctors (such as tezacaftor and VX-445), facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of mutant 
CFTR to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in enhanced chloride 
transport. CFTR potentiators (like ivacaftor) enhance the channel gating activity of the CFTR which is 
delivered to the cell surface (by correctors).  
Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) and Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor, 
TEZ/IVA) are CFTR modulators approved for CF patients with specific mutations.  
The initially claimed indication for Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio was: 
“Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with elexacaftor 100 mg/tezacaftor 50 
mg/ivacaftor 75 mg tablets for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with 
cystic fibrosis (CF) who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene” 
The proposed indication covered F/F genotypes, F/MF ‘minimal function’ genotypes, F/G ‘gating’ 
genotypes, and F/RF ‘residual function’ genotypes. It comprises subpopulations in which approved 
modulator therapies are available (F508del homozygous patients (F/F), patient heterozygous for 
F508del and a specific residual function mutation (F/RF) or a specific gating mutation (F/G). 
Nevertheless, these treatments do not cure the disease and more efficacious treatments could fulfil the 
gap in these patients. For the populations heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation 
(F/MF) no treatment is available, which suggests an unmet need in this subpopulation. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy and safety is obtained from three trials. All three trials investigated the 
triple VX-445 200 mg/tezacaftor 100mg/ivacaftor 150mg morning dose in combination with ivacaftor 
150 mg as evening dose. 
Study 102 in CF patients 12 years an older is a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study in subjects heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and a minimal 
function mutation (as defined by the MAH). A total of 403 subjects received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. Placebo was used as control treatment because no CFTR modulators were approved. The primary

endpoint was absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1, which was accompanied by several key 
secondary endpoints (pulmonary exacerbations, SwCl, CFQ-R RD, BMI).  
Study 103 in CF patients 12 years an older is a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, TEZ/IVA-
controlled, parallel-group study in subjects homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. A total of 107 
subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug. TEZ/IVA (Symkevi) was used a control treatment, as 
this is an approved therapy in this patient populations. The primary endpoint was absolute change 
from baseline in ppFEV1, which was accompanied by key secondary endpoints on SwCl and CFQ-R RD 
score.  
Study 105 is an ongoing open-label rollover study that enrolled subjects from study 102 (n=400) and 
103 (n=107). This study is designed to support long-term safety (primary) and maintenance of 
efficacy (secondary). Interim analysis 2 (IA2) is submitted to allow evaluation of long-term safety of 
patients F/F and F/MF patients. Efficacy data, with an additional 36 week or 24 week treatment, are 
submitted is for F/F patients which were enrolled in study 103 and for F/MF patients enrolled in study 
24, respectively. 
The core safety analyses consist of separate analyses of Studies 102 and 103, and the second interim 
analysis (IA2) of the open-label extension Study 105.  The safety profile of VX-445/TEZ/IVA was 
mainly derived from Study 102. Safety data from Studies 102 and 103 were not pooled because of the 
substantial differences in the designs of the 2 studies. In addition, analyses of the Cumulative Safety 
Set and a subset of subjects in the Cumulative Safety Set who received ≥ 48 weeks of treatment with 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA were submitted.  
The Study 102 Safety Set contains all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Study 
103 Safety includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Study 103 Treatment 
Period (i.e., does not include subjects who were only dosed in the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period). The Study 
105 Safety Set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Study 105. The 
Cumulative Safety Set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of VX-445/TEZ/IVA during the 
parent Studies 102 or 103 and/or during Study 105.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Dose regimen 
For CF patients 18 years and older with an F/MF mutation three doses (50mg, 100mg and 200mg) of 
VX-445 were tested in combination with the approved dosage of TEZ/IVA. ppFEV1 and SwCl changes 
from baseline with the TC are compared to changes from baseline with placebo. A difference in ppFEV1 
compared to placebo is seen for all dose tested strengths (11.1, 7.8 and 13.8, for 50, 100 and 200mg 
respectively). For SwCl, an improvement (decline) compared to placebo is detected (-36.1, -31.0, 36.9 
for 50, 100 and 200mg respectively). In all cases, (the efficacy data, the exposure-response models 
and the simulated efficacy data for FEV1 and SwCl) the 200-mg provides the best performance. 
For CF patients 18 years and older with an F/F mutation, only the final 200 mg dose of VX-445 was 
investigated. A benefit with VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to TEZ/IVA is seen (ppFEV1:10.6%; SwCl: -
40.4 mmol/L). 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/MF genotype (study 102) 
Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA showed an absolute change in ppFEV1 through week 24 
between the IVA 150 mg and VX-445/TEZ/IVA versus placebo groups of 14.3% (CI 95%:  12.7 – 15.8; 
p<0.0001) in favour of the triple combination with ivacaftor. A comparable difference was observed at 
week 4 already (13.7; CI 95% 12.0 - 15.3; p<0.0001). Approximately 80% patients treated with the 
TC have an increase in ppFEV1 >5%, compared to 15% in the placebo group.

Several key secondary endpoints were analysed. For pulmonary exacerbations, the rate ratio was 0.37 
(95% CI: 0.25 – 0.55, p<0.0001) in favour of VX-445/TEZ/IVA in combination with ivacaftor, a 
reduction of 63%. The hazard ratio for time-to-first pulmonary exacerbations was also in favour of the 
triple combination (HR: 0.34; 95% CI 0.22, 0.52; p<0.0001). For changes in SwCl from baseline, a 
stable reduction of -41.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.4 to -39.3; p< 0.0001) through week 24 compared to 
placebo was observed. A higher CRQ-R RD score was observed in the TC arm compared to the placebo 
arm (20.2 points; 95% CI 17.5,23.0; p<0.0001). All other CFQ-R domains indicated an improvement 
with the TC compared to placebo. Last, an absolute change of 1.04 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.23; p<0.0001) 
compared to placebo was seen in BMI.  
All other endpoints also showed a positive effect for VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to placebo. 
Consistent and significant benefits in ppFEV1 favouring VX-445/TEZ/IVA in combination with ivacaftor 
were observed across all prespecified subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, P. 
aeruginosa infection, and baseline use of common CF medications. 
An ad-hoc subgroup analysis was performed on patients included based in genetic criterion 1 (likely to 
protein translated) and on criterion 2 (missense not responding the TEZ and/or IVA in vitro). Class 1 
(MF) mutant patients show an absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 of 14.8% comparing the triple 
combination with placebo. The missense mutant patients show a difference in ppFEV1 of 12.9%. 
Further subdivision of these genotypes (nonsense, splicing, and indel-frameshift) and FRT 
responsiveness show reasonably similar results. Subject treated with the TC in parent study continue 
to have a comparable benefit at 24 weeks (study 102) and through 48 weeks (study 105) of 
treatment, respectively (ppFEV1: 13.9 vs 14.3; SwCl: -42.2 vs -49.0; CFQ-R RD: 17.5 vs 20.1). 
Patients which received placebo in the parent study show similar benefits (ppFEV1: 14.9, SwCL: -50.3, 
CFQ-R: 19.2) in these parameters after 24 weeks of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment in combination with 
ivacaftor. 
With the results from study 105, also data for exacerbations and nutritional status became available. 
With regard to the number of PEx an estimated event rate per year of 0.32 (95% CI: 0.24-0.44) is 
anticipated. With regard to the nutritional status, a benefit compared to baseline is observed for all 
parameters (change in BMI, BMI z-score and body weight). 
Real world data from the US CFFPR for F/MF mutations showed consistent results with what was seen 
in the clinical study 102. 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype (study 103/105) 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA in combination with ivacaftor  showed an absolute change in ppFEV1 at week 4 
between the VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA groups of 10.0% (7.4 – 12.6; p<0.0001) in favor of the 
triple combination. Approximately 70% patients treated with the TC have an increase in ppFEV1 >5%, 
compared to 13% in the TEZ/IVA group. 
For the key secondary endpoint, change in SwCl from baseline, a reduction of -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: 
-50.1 to -40.1; p< 0.0001) at week 4 is observed after treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to 
TEZ/IVA. Change in CRQ-R RD score, key secondary endpoint, improved significantly in the TC arm 
compared to the TEZ/IVA arm (17.4 points; 95% CI 11.8,23.0; p<0.0001), all other CFQ-R domains 
indicated an improvement with the TC compared to TEZ/IVA. 
Ad hoc analyses on BMI and weight also demonstrate of beneficial effect of the TC over TEZ/IVA. 
Consistent benefits in ppFEV1 favouring VX-445/TEZ/IVA in combination with ivacaftor were observed 
across all prespecified subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, P. aeruginosa infection, and 
baseline use of common CF medications.

Subject treated with the TC in combination with ivacaftor in parent study continue to have a similar 
benefit at 4 weeks (study 103) and through 36 (ppFEV1) or 24 weeks (SwCL and CFQ-R) (study 105) 
of treatment, respectively (ppFEV1: 10.4 vs 11.9; SwCl: -43.4 vs -47.2; CFQ-R RD: 16vs 14.3). 
Patients which received placebo in the parent study show comparable benefits (ppFEV1: 12.8, SwCL: -
49.4, CFQ-R: 13.8) in these parameters after 36/24 weeks of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment in 
combination with ivacaftor. 
With regard to the number of PEx an estimated event rate per year of 0.30 (95% CI: 0.20-0.45) and a 
probability of event-free survival of 0.859 (95% CI: 0.777-0.912) is anticipated. With regard to the 
nutritional status, a benefit compared to baseline is observed for all parameters (change in BMI, BMI z-
score and body weight). 
Real world data from the US CFFPR for F/F showed consistent results with what was seen in the clinical 
study 103. 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/RF and F/G genotype (real world data). 
No clinical data was provided for the F/RF and F/G genotypes. Real world data from the US CFFPR for 
F/RF and F/G patients treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA were however provided towards the end of the 
assessment. Based on the available data, improvements in ppFEV1 were seen in the F/G and F/RF 
populations of 4.3% and 2.7% respectively, compared to a baseline ppFEV1 measurement before the 
start of VX-445/TEZ/IVA therapy. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The MAH hypothesis that if a modulator has a large effect on the F508del-CFTR, the presence of a 
single F508del allele would be sufficient to derive a clinical benefit (as defined by the F/any treatment 
paradigm) could not be demonstrated unambiguously, as it is theoretically still possible that some of 
the MF mutants may make a minor contribution to the CFTR-mediated chloride transport upon 
treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA in combination with ivacaftor.  
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/MF and F/F genotype (study 102 and study 103) 
In the F/MF patients, placebo is used as a comparator and in F/F TEZ/IVA are used as comparator. The 
added benefit over VX-445 monotherapy or VX-445/IVA is not investigated in a clinical setting.  
In study 102 the definition of an MF mutation (1) no protein or (2) not responding to TEZ, IVA or 
TEZ/IVA in vitro) is different when compared to the standard MF definition (Class I, II and III 
mutations). An ad-hoc subgroup analysis showed a consistent benefit in the patient included based on 
criterion 1 (and in the nonsense, splicing and indel frameshift subgroups). However, some small 
uncertainties remain on whether all criterion (1) mutants do not form a protein.  
Not all known MF mutations can be tested in clinical trial setting. 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype (study 103/105) 
Stratification according to ppFEV1 was applied on the ppFEV1 measurements taken after at least 13 
days of TEZ/IVA run-in, rather than the screening ppFEV1 values. These ppFEV1 measurements are 
influenced by whether the patients were Vertex CFTR modulator naïve or experienced. The data 
suggests that the screening period of 4 weeks may not have been sufficient for CFTR-modulator naïve 
patients randomized to TEZ/IVA to derive the full benefit of this treatment by time of baseline ppFEV1 
assessment. Consequently, it is considered that the magnitude of the treatment effect of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA vs TEZ/IVA in the overall study 102 population may be overestimated and that the 
treatment effect estimate obtained in the CFTR-modulator experienced patients is relevant to 
prescribers (LS mean 7.8%, 95% CI (4.8,10.8)). 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 97/108 
 
 
 
Effect on number of PEx can only be determined by data from study 105, without a control group or 
event rate at baseline present. When comparing the observed PEx data for study 103/105 to the data 
from for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group in study 102 these are considered similar. Therefore, the 
presented exacerbation results for F/F patients from study 105, are likely to be supportive for the 
benefit seen with the TC.  
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/RF and F/G genotype (real world data). 
The registry data presented is in itself limited and not sufficiently detailed, and as such raises 
questions. For example, the exact modulator therapy used, the duration of use is not known, as well as 
included specific genotypes and individual patient efficacy data not present. Unavailability of such 
information is inherent to obtaining data from a registry but leads to questioning whether the patients 
in the analysis set can be considered sufficiently representative of the overall F/G and F/RF populations 
to draw conclusions on these populations. Bearing in mind the limitations and questions arising from 
the registry data, the magnitude of the additional response from treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA over 
prior CFTR modulator therapies is not overwhelming. It is unexpected that the F/G group had a greater 
gain than that seen in the F/RF population. Indeed, in view of the limited efficacy observed in clinical 
trials for F/RF patients treated with TEZ/IVA  compared those patients with G/any mutations treated 
with IVA, it would be considered that F/RF group should have had more potential for improvement with 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA by treating the F allele.  
Overall, due to the uncertainties on the patients included and the effect size seen, these data cannot 
be accepted as the main data source for the F/G and F/RF populations. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
As most patients were included in Study 102, the safety profile of VX-445/TEZ/IVA in combination with 
ivacaftor was mainly determined by Study 102.  
Treatment-emergent AEs were reported for nearly all patients in both arms in the Study 102 Safety 
Set (93.1% of patients in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm vs. 96.0% in the placebo arm). TEAEs with an 
incidence of at least 8% in either treatment group and in VX-445/TEZ/IVA >1% higher than in placebo 
were headache, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, alanine transaminase 
(ALT) increased, aspartate transaminase (AST) increased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, 
nasal congestion, rash, and rhinorrhoea. Important AEs observed with incidence rates ≥ 3% and ≥1% 
more frequent than placebo are influenza, wheezing and hypoglycaemia.    
The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 12 years and older were headache 
(17.3%), diarrhoea (12.9%) and upper respiratory tract infection (11.9%). Adverse drug reactions 
were mostly mild to moderate and resolved without requiring treatment discontinuation.   
Related AEs occurred in 5.0% of patients treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA and in 3.0% treated with 
placebo; 42.6% of the subject in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 22.9% subjects in the placebo group 
had an AE assessed by the investigator as possibly related. 
Grade 3-4 AEs were reported for 9.4% (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) vs. 7.5% (placebo) of patients; infective 
pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (4.5%, placebo)  and blood creatine increased (2%, VX-
445/TEZ/IVA), ALT increased (1%, VX-445/TEZ/IVA), and AST increased (1%, VX-445/TEZ/IVA) were 
the only Grade 3 or 4 AEs that had an incidence of at least 1% in either treatment group.  
SAEs were reported for 13.9% (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) vs. 20.9 % (placebo). The SAEs that occurred in ≥
1% of patients in either treatment group were infective PEx of CF (5.4% vs. 16.4%), haemoptysis 
(1.0% vs. 1.5%) and rash (1.0% vs. 0.5%) and influenza (1.5% vs 0%). Related SAEs occurred in 
Assessment report  
EMA/563387/2020  
Page 98/108 
 
 
 
3.0% (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) vs. 1.0% (placebo). No related SAEs occurred in 2 or more patients in either 
treatment group. 
Transaminase elevations are common in CF patients receiving IVA monotherapy, TEZ/IVA, and VX-
445/TEZ/IVA. In the pivotal VX-445/TEZ/IVA, exclusion criteria for patients with pre-existing liver 
function impairments were more stringent compared to the Orkambi trials and Symkevi. The incidence 
of transaminase elevation adverse events was 2-3 times higher in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group than in 
the placebo group. The vast majority of the events were non-severe, non-serious and did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation. Increases from baseline in mean total bilirubin were also observed in the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, with a greater increase in indirect bilirubin than direct bilirubin, while in the 
placebo group, changes from baseline in mean total bilirubin were minimal. AEs associated with 
bilirubin elevation occurred in 10 (5.0%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (1.0%) subjects 
in the placebo group. None of the AEs of bilirubin elevation were serious or led to treatment 
discontinuation. This is already addressed in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 of Kalydeco. 
Rash occurred more frequently in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (10.9%, 22 subjects) than in the placebo 
group (6.5%, 13 subjects). Most rashes occurred within the first 3 weeks of study drug treatment. 
Serious rash events occurred in 3 (1.5%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group compared to 1 (0.5%) 
subject in the placebo group. A warning section 4.4 has been included in the Kalydeco SmPC.  
AEs of CK elevation occurred more frequently in subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group compared to 
the placebo group. The majority were asymptomatic laboratory elevations, many of which were 
preceded by exercise. The 2 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with AEs of rhabdomyolysis 
presented with CK elevations, and neither subject had clinical features of rhabdomyolysis (e.g., kidney 
involvement, myoglobinuria). Both subjects had performed strenuous exercise. However, the Kalydeco 
SmPC has been amended to reflect increase in blood creatine phosphokinase. 
Incidental increases from baseline in mean BP parameters were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group. Only a limited number of subjects had a blood pressure in the hypertensive range. However, 
the Kalydeco SmPC has been amended to reflect increase of blood pressure. 
In Study 103 Safety set, the incidence of subjects with at least 1 AE was 58.2% in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group and 63.5% in the TEZ/IVA group. In general, a similar pattern was in the TEAEs, 
but overall, with lower frequencies.  
The long-term safety data (Study 105 Safety Set, OLS) showed decreased exposure-adjusted event 
rate of (related AEs), Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs with VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to the Study 102 Safety 
Set. In the Cumulative Safety Set, the safety profile is quite similar to the safety profile of Study 102 
Safety Set.  
In Study 105 Safety Set, 7 (1.4%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation, of whom 3 
subjects discontinued due to AEs of transaminase elevation. The other subjects discontinued treatment 
due to AEs of depression (1 subject), rash (1 subject), tinnitus and contusion (1 subject), and hepatic 
encephalopathy (1 subject).  
Influenza was reported in the clinical studies performed in association with Kaftrio and therefore has 
been included as an ADR in section 4.8. The applicant committed to continue the monitoring of 
influenza in the post marketing setting.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In Study 105 IA2, 229 subject patients had an exposure of > 24 ≤ 48 weeks and 271 patients had an 
exposure ≥48 weeks. More information will become available during post-marketing pharmacovigilance 
when final results of the Study 105 will be submitted.  
Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. In addition, only in case of urgent and unavoidable need for treatment with Kaftrio and 
after weighing the benefits and risks of such treatment, Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
may be used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment applying a dose reduction, this has been 
introduced in the Kalydeco SmPC.  
Rash occurred frequently with Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment. There was an 
increase in the incidence of rash in female subjects taking hormonal therapy compared with those not 
taking hormonal therapy; the increase was larger in the Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group than in the placebo group. Therefore, a role for hormonal therapy in the occurrence of rash 
cannot be excluded. A warning in section 4.4. of the SmPC has been included.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
According to the MAH, if a modulator has a large effect on the F508del-CFTR, then the presence of a 
single F508del allele would be sufficient to derive a clinical benefit. Based on this new hypothesis and 
the results from study 102 and 103, a broad indication was initially proposed to include all patients 
with at least one F508del mutation independently of the second allele. This means that efficacy for 
non-tested populations of F/MF, F/RF and F/G should be extrapolated. It should be noted that 
uncertainties remain on the value of the new paradigm proposed, as it is not accepted by CHMP that all 
class 1 MF mutations are equal, and that no protein is produced in each and every case. Therefore, it 
cannot be excluded that some of the MF mutants may make a contribution to the CFTR-mediated 
chloride transport upon treatment with Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/MF genotype 
Importance of the favourable effects 
The observed difference of 14.3% between Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA and placebo 
in absolute change of ppFEV1 is well above the predefined threshold (5%) and also above the 
definition of clinical relevance in the context of the natural decline in CF patients in the pivotal study 
102. Approximately 80% patients treated with the TC have a benefit of ppFEV1 >5%, compared to 
15% in the placebo group. The results are considered clinically relevant.  
The rate ratio of 0.37 for exacerbations comparing VX-445/TEZ/IVA to placebo is relevant. 
Strength of the evidence 
Consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA were 
observed across all prespecified subgroups. 
The results of the primary parameter are supported by all key secondary parameters. CFQ-R 
respiratory domain, BMI and sweat chloride all showed improvements well above the MCID. 
The results were consistent across the subgroups of criterion 1 and criterion 2 mutations and upon 
further subdivision based on genotype or in vitro responsiveness.  
Impact of the uncertainties 
Not all known MF mutations can be tested in a clinical trial. The clinical benefit seen in these F/MF 
patients has such a large effect size, that it is unlikely that uncertainties related to MF mutations not 
being tested, the absence of a direct in vitro in vivo comparison, inclusion criteria or chosen dose 
regimen will affect the data to such an extent that the benefit could be questioned. 
Based on the pre-clinical data, the clinical data and the lack of evidence that all MF mutation do not 
form a protein, the F508del-only treatment paradigm has not been definitively substantiated.  
The consistent results in the F/MF population subgroups, together with the magnitude of the efficacy 
observed indicate that extrapolation to untested MF mutations can however be accepted.  
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype 
Importance of the favourable effects 
The observed difference of 10.0% between VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA in absolute change of 
ppFEV1 is well above the predefined threshold (5%) and also above the definition of clinical relevance

in the context of the natural decline in CF patients in the pivotal study 103. Approximately 70% 
patients treated with the TC have a benefit of ppFEV1 >5%, compared to 13% in the TEZ/IVA group. 
The results are considered clinically relevant.  
The results from study 105 confirm the benefit in FEV1 was maintained until 24 week. For pulmonary 
exacerbations, the estimated event rate per year was 0.30 in the F/F population of study 105. 
Strength of the evidence 
Consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA were 
observed across all prespecified subgroups. 
The result of the primary parameter is supported by all key secondary parameters. CFQ-R respiratory 
domain, BMI and sweat chloride all showed improvements well above the MCID. 
Study 103 had a duration of only 4 weeks, but from study 105 it was concluded that all effect seen in 
primary and secondary endpoints at week 4 were maintained through week 24.  
Impact of the uncertainties 
The clinical benefit seen in these patients has such a large effect size, that it is unlikely that 
uncertainties related to for example sensitivity analyses, inclusion criteria or chosen dose regimen will 
affect the data in such an extent that this benefit could be questioned.  
While there are no controlled data after 4 weeks for F/F patients due to the short study treatment 
duration, limited open label extension data from the 107 patients (F/F) that enrolled from parent Study 
103 are provided. For the key parameters such as ppFEV1, Sweat Chloride, CFQ-R as well as rate of 
pulmonary exacerbations the improvements seen at 4 weeks appear to be sustained in all patients, 
and the BMI, BMI z score and weight outcomes seem to continue to improve. The requested ongoing 
results from F/F patients in Study 105 remain favourable. Therefore, the limitation of the short-
controlled treatment period can be accepted.  
CF patients with the 12 years or older F/RF or F/G genotype 
Kalydeco monotherapy has been shown to result in an improvement in ppFEV1 for F/G subjects while 
the improvement in the case of F/RF with Symkevi (which excludes the most prevalent RF mutation, 
i.e., R117H) is more limited. Thus, there is still a need for better treatment for these patients.  
In the current variation no in vitro data have been presented, either in Fisher Rat Typhoid (FRT) cells 
(a heterologous system which allows the expression of a single CFTR mutant) or in Human Bronchial 
Epithelial (HBE) cells from donors with CF. No clinical data have been submitted either to assess the 
benefit risk in patients with F/G and F/RF mutations. Real world data form the US registry were 
provided. The ppFEV1 results suggest improvement on top of other CFTR modulators, but registry data 
come with many uncertainties due to bias and missing information.  
Cross-study comparison, responder analysis and the registry data on its own without the ongoing 
clinical study 104 data in F/G and F/RF mutations do not sufficiently support the added benefit of 
VX445/TEZ/IVA over approved modulator therapies. The lack of clear demonstration of the alleged 
"new paradigm" (F/any) does not support the extrapolation of the available data to these populations. 
Demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety by a randomized controlled trial is thus needed. Therefore, 
the CHMP considered that the efficacy has been demonstrated only in patients with F/F and F/MF 
mutations where randomized clinical trial data are available. 
Study 104, performed in this population, is ongoing. Results from this study will be submitted by the 
MAH in a variation procedure as soon as available, in order to help estimate the magnitude of 
additional benefit to these patients.

Safety 
Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA was well tolerated with low discontinuation rates due to 
AEs. The safety profile of the combination is recognizable when compared with the already licensed 
components and appeared comparable across studies. However, there were more adverse events for 
increased ALT, AST and bilirubin indicative for hepatic involvement. Based on a PK study in subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment, yielding increased exposure to VX-445, Ivacaftor in combination 
with VX-445/TEZ/IVA is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Only in case 
of urgent and unavoidable need for treatment with Ivacaftor in combination with Kaftrio and after 
weighing the benefits and risks of such treatment, Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA may 
be used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment applying a dose reduction. Expected exposure in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been investigated but is expected to be higher than 
that in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, and therefore, in the absence of further data in this 
patient population, Ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA should not be used in such patients. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The balance of benefits and risks has to be determined in three separate populations: the patients for 
whom preclinical and or clinical data is available (F/F and tested F/MF) and for the broader set of 
patients 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.  
For CF patients with the F/F genotype, the placebo-controlled study provided efficacy data that 
demonstrate that ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA provides a clinical benefit, both in the 
primary and the key secondary endpoints.  
For CF patients with the F/MF genotype included in study 102, the active (TEZ/IVA) control study also 
provided efficacy data that demonstrate that ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA provides a 
clinical benefit, both in the primary and the key secondary endpoints.  
For both populations, the results were considered sufficiently robust and clinically relevant.  
The safety profile of ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA was derived primarily from Study 
102. The extensive clinical experiences with CFTR modulator therapies (including IVA and TEZ/IVA) 
indicate that the safety profile is consistent across different genotypes for each of the individual CFTR 
modulator treatments. As such, the safety profile established from Study 102 in F/MF subjects is 
considered representative for the entire proposed indication, which is supported by the comparable 
safety profile observed in Study 103.  
Overall, ivacaftor in combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA was well tolerated with low discontinuation 
rates due to AEs. Most important adverse events concerned the adverse events indicative for hepatic 
involvement (ALT, AST and bilirubin). At the moment until more data become available, ivacaftor in 
combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA may be used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment applying 
a dose reduction. only in case of urgent and unavoidable need for treatment with ivacaftor in 
combination with Kaftrio and after weighing the benefits and risks of such treatment, ivacaftor in 
combination with VX-445/TEZ/IVA may be used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment applying 
a dose reduction.  
The long-term study 105 revealed no important additional safety events.  
Overall, the data of clinical studies 102, 105 and 103 indicate a large clinical benefit of ivacaftor in 
combination with VX-445/TEX/IVA in F/F and F/MF patients. Although the evidence for the F508del-
only hypothesis is considered not definitively conclusive and some uncertainties remain, the highly 
clinically relevant benefit, and the consistency of these effects seen with ivacaftor in combination with 
Assessment report

Page 106/108 
 
 
 
  
VX-445/TEZ/IVA in studies/subgroups make the extrapolation to all patients with an F/MF genotype 
acceptable. 
For F/RF and F/G population, the evidence for the F508del-only hypothesis is considered not 
definitively conclusive. The registry data provided for these patients are welcome, but subject to 
limitations and to bias to reliably demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in combination with 
VX445/TEZ/IVA in F/G and F/RF patients. In conclusion the CHMP was of the view that the registry 
data do not obviate the need for robust, comparative, clinical data in F/G and F/RF patients from 
clinical trials.  
While the benefit/risk balance for the extension of the indication to the broad population (i.e., all CF 
patients who have at least one F508del mutation) is considered negative, a positive B/R balance can 
be considered for the F/F and F/MF patient populations 
The indication granted by CHMP for Kalydeco tablets is therefore as follows: 
• 
In a combination regimen with ivacaftor 75 mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/elexacaftor 100 mg tablets for 
the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with CF who are homozygous 
for F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a 
minimal function (MF) mutation (see section 5.1). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kalydeco is positive in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 75 mg/tezacaftor 50 
mg/elexacaftor 100 mg tablets for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older 
with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or heterozygous for 
F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation.

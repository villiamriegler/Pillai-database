1.  Introduction 
On December 7, 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study EP0130 for lacosamide, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH submitted the EP0130 study “Vimpat tablets 50mg, Vimpat tablets 100mg, Vimpat 
dry syrup 10% Specified drug use-results surveillance -Monotherapy for partial onset seizures in 
paediatric patients with epilepsy” is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Lacosamide has been approved as monotherapy and adjunctive treatment in patients with partial onset 
seizures (POS) in the EU (2 years of age and older for tablets, oral solution [syrup], and intravenous 
[iv] infusion), US (1 month of age and older for tablets, oral solution [syrup], and iv infusion), and 
Japan (4 years of age and older for tablets, dry syrup, and iv infusion). Lacosamide has also been 
approved as adjunctive treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with 
idiopathic generalized epilepsy in the EU (4 years of age and older for tablets, oral solution [syrup], 
and iv infusion), US (4 years of age and older for tablets, oral solution [syrup], and iv infusion), and 
Japan (for patients 4 years of age and older with epilepsy who have not obtained sufficient response to 
other antiseizure medications for tablets, dry syrup, and iv infusion). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted <a> final report(s) for: 
• 
EP0130 study “Vimpat tablets 50mg, Vimpat tablets 100mg, Vimpat dry syrup 10% Specified 
drug use-results surveillance -Monotherapy for partial onset seizures in pediatric patients with 
epilepsy” 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
EP0130 study “Vimpat tablets 50mg, Vimpat tablets 100mg, Vimpat dry 
syrup 10% Specified drug use-results surveillance - Monotherapy for 
partial onset seizures in pediatric patients with epilepsy”  
Description 
EP0130 was a post-marketing surveillance study intended to detect the incidence of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs), to evaluate effectiveness, and to evaluate factors that may have affected the safety 
and effectiveness during the actual post-marketing use of VIMPAT tablets 50mg, VIMPAT tablets 
100mg, and VIMPAT dry syrup 10% (hereafter referred to as “the Survey Drug”) as monotherapy.

This surveillance was conducted as a non-interventional study to confirm the safety and effectiveness 
of this drug under daily clinical practice based on the approved indications and dosage and 
administration.  
EP0130 was conducted using a central registration system. Investigators registered patients, who 
newly initiated the administration of the Survey Drug, within 14 days, including the date initiating the 
administration for the first time. The observation period was 26 weeks. In case the administration 
period was less than 26 weeks (caused by discontinuation/no-show, etc), the observation period ended 
on the date of the discontinuation of the administration. Additionally, if patients had surgical operations 
or vagus nerve stimulation therapies, etc, aimed at treating epilepsy, the observation period ended on 
the previous date of the procedure. For those patients who discontinued the administration, as much 
as possible, a surveillance was conducted 2 weeks after discontinuation to check for possible 
withdrawal symptoms and rebound phenomenon. 
Methods 
Study participants 
The surveillance population included patients with POS (including secondary generalized seizures), who 
were 4 years to <16 years of age on the start date of administration of the Survey Drug, and who had 
newly initiated treatment with the Survey Drug and received the Survey Drug as monotherapy.  
Treatments 
EP0130 was conducted in Japan based on approved indications, dosage, and administration and 
included medical institutions where the Survey Drug had been delivered/adopted. 
Objective(s) 
This surveillance is intended to detect the incidence of adverse reactions, to evaluate effectiveness, 
and to evaluate factors that may affect the safety and effectiveness during the actual post-marketing 
use of “Vimpat® Tablets 50mg, Vimpat® Tablets 100mg, Vimpat® Dry Syrup 10%. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The prespecified time point for the evaluation of effectiveness under actual postmarketing use was 
Week 26 of the treatment with the Survey Drug (or upon discontinuation). Evaluable pediatric patients 
were those for whom global improvement rating was determined at the final evaluation time point. The 
acceptable time window for each evaluation time point was ±28 days. 
Safety Specifications (serious and nonserious) for the safety analysis set included the following 
important identified risks: electrocardiogram PR prolongation-related events (eg, atrioventricular block, 
bradycardia, syncope); toxic epidermal necrolysis and mucocutaneous ocular (Stevens Johnson) 
syndrome; drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome; and agranulocytosis. 
Effectiveness evaluations included: 
Response rate based on global improvement rating 
Global improvement rating: Evaluation on a 3-point scale, consisting of “Improved,” 
“Unchanged,” and “Worsened” during the observation period. Pediatric patients rated as 
“Improved” were considered as responders. 
Seizure-free rate 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/106809/2024  
Page 5/17 
 
 
 
Seizure-free patients were defined as pediatric patients who had no seizures 
throughout the observation period. 
Percent reduction in seizure frequency 
Number of seizures noted within the past 4 weeks compared with Baseline seizure 
frequency. 
Sample size 
A total of 150 patients were planned in the surveillance. The following rational for the sample size was 
provided: 
In the phase III study of lacosamide oral formulation in adults (all population including Japanese 
subjects), the incidence of adverse drug reactions related to cardiac disorder was 2.27%. Assuming 
that cardiac disorder occurred at similar rate (3%) in the study of pediatrics population, target sample 
size is set to 100 cases to estimate the incidence rate with a power of 95%. 
On the other hand, for effectiveness, in a Phase III clinical study of monotherapy in adult patients (all 
population including Japanese subjects), the proportion of 6-month seizure-free subjects was 
approximately 70%. Assuming a true 6-month seizure-free rate of 70%, the sample size in the 
surveillance is set to 150 to detect the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for seizure-free rate in 
the surveillance exceeding the threshold of 56% (calculated as 20% lower than the assumed true rate) 
at a power of 90%. 
Statistics 
Descriptive analysis 
Summary statistics such as ratio, mean, standard deviation, two-sided 95% confidence interval, 
minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum were calculated.  
Statistical tests were performed in subgroup analyses for the safety and effectiveness. Categorical data 
in 2 x 2 tables were analyzed by Fisher's exact test, and those in larger than 2 Percent reduction in 
seizure frequency (%) = "Baseline seizure frequency"- "Seizure frequency at each evaluation time 
point" X 100 Baseline seizure frequency x 2 tables were analyzed by Monte Carlo estimation. Ordered 
scale data were analyzed by Cochran-Armitage test. Tests were performed with two-sided significance 
level of 5%.  
Statistical measures were not used for other endpoints. Descriptive analyses were performed by 
calculating two-sided 95% confidence intervals. 
Results 
Recruitment 
There were 204 pediatric patients enrolled and 194 pediatric patients with surveillance sheets collected 
in EP0130. Of these 194 pediatric patients with surveillance sheets collected, 183 pediatric patients 
were included in the safety analysis set (after excluding patients who met exclusion criteria for the 
safety analysis). Of these 183 pediatric patients included in the safety analysis set, 151 pediatric 
patients were included in the effectiveness analysis set (after excluding patients who met exclusion 
criteria for the effectiveness analysis).

Safety results 
A total of 183 pediatric patients were included in the safety analysis set. 
The incidence of ADRs was 12.02% (22/183 pediatric patients); ADRs were most frequently reported in 
the system organ class (SOC) of Nervous system disorders (7.65%). The most commonly reported 
ADRs by preferred term (PT) were somnolence (7 pediatric patients [3.83%]) and dizziness (5 
pediatric patients [2.73%]), which were within the SOC of Nervous system disorders. The incidence of 
serious ADRs was 1.09% (2/183 pediatric patients); serious ADRs by PT were epilepsy and leukopenia 
(1 pediatric patient each). No infections were reported. 
Of the pediatric patients excluded from the safety analysis set, 2 pediatric patients experienced ADRs 
(by PT of anxiety, crying, and epilepsy [1 pediatric patient] and dizziness and headache [1 pediatric 
patient]). Of these ADRs by PT, epilepsy was considered serious in 1 pediatric patient. 
None of the Safety Specifications were observed.

Data source: EP0130 final report Table 2 
The MAH examined factors for potential impact on the incidence rates of ADRs (refer to the EP0130 
final report [Module 5.3.5.4] for additional details). 
There were statistically significant differences by age at Baseline (see Section 5.1.3.1 for additional 
details regarding the incidence rates of ADRs by age at Baseline). The incidence rate of ADRs tended to 
be higher in the older age groups. The incidence rate of pediatric patients with ADRs in the 12 years to 
<16 years age group was 27.50%. The incidence rate of ADRs in the SOC of Nervous system 
disorders, including neurological events, which are the main, commonly observed ADRs for 
antiepileptic drugs, including this Survey Drug, tended to be higher in the older age groups.

The Survey Drug was administered to 1 pediatric patient with renal impairment. The Survey Drug was 
administered to 2 pediatric patients with hepatic impairment. No ADRs were observed in the pediatric 
patient with renal impairment or in the pediatric patients with hepatic impairment. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH submitted a completed paediatric study EP0130 for lacosamide, in accordance with Article 46 
of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. The study EP0130 was a post-marketing surveillance study intended 
to detect the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), to evaluate effectiveness, and to evaluate 
factors that may have affected the safety and effectiveness during the actual post-marketing use of 
lacosamide as monotherapy. 
This surveillance was conducted as a non-interventional study to confirm the safety and effectiveness 
of this drug under daily clinical practice based on the approved indications and dosage and 
administration. 
The surveillance population included patients with POS (including secondary generalized seizures), who 
were 4 years to <16 years of age on the start date of administration of LCM, and who had newly 
initiated treatment with the LCM and received it as monotherapy. 
There were 204 pediatric patients enrolled and 183 pediatric patients included in the safety analysis 
set, and 151 pediatric patients were included in the effectiveness analysis set. The observation period 
was 26 weeks.  
The mean age of pediatric patients was 8.85 years, and the mean body weight was 30.09kg. The mean 
duration of epilepsy was 1.19 years with the majority (73%) having a duration of less than 1 year. The 
most common seizure types reported by pediatric patients in the safety analysis set were complex 
partial seizures (56.28%) and secondarily generalized seizures (38.25%). The seizure frequency was 
relatively low with the mean Baseline seizure frequency of 4.26 seizures per 4 weeks. Approximately 
88.5% have not been previously treated with any ASM. Thus, it could be considered that patients 
included into this survey were rather mild and early in their disease development.  
The most common mean daily doses per body weight were between 2mg/kg and 4mg/kg (47,52%), 
and 4mg/kg and 8mg/kg (37.16%) for safety analysis set.  
The effectiveness assessed as response rate based on global improvement rating, seizure-free rate and 
the mean percent reduction in seizure frequency was 85.43%, 55.63% and 79.79%, respectively. 
These exploratory data do not indicate any potential issues/differences of effectiveness of LCM 
treatment from the known effect in the population studied in real world setting. 
The safety analyses set included 183 patients. The incidence of ADRs was 12.02%. The most common 
reported ADRs by preferred term were somnolence and dizziness in line with the information provided 
in the SmPC. The incidence of serious ADRs was 1.09% and included epilepsy and leukopenia (1 
pediatric patient each). No infections were reported.  
The MAH reported that the incidence rate of ADRs tended to be higher in the older age groups. The 
incidence rate of paediatric patients with ADRs in the 12 years to <18 years age group was 26.86%. 
This observation that there were statistically significant differences in age at baseline in reporting the 
ADRs is difficult to interpret having in mind study design. 
In summary, no new information regarding effectiveness of LCM when used as monotherapy according 
to approved indication and dosing was reported. Also, safety and tolerability of LCM in patients 
included into the study did not reveal any new safety concerns and can be considered to be consistent 
with the known safety profile. Thus, the MAH proposal not to update the SmPC could be endorsed.

The benefit risk ratio of LCM treatment in paediatric patients when treated according to approved 
indications and dosage remains unchanged. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The safety and tolerability of LCM in paediatric patients with POS included into the study EP0130 did 
not reveal any new safety concerns. Thus, based on the results of the EP0130 study the MAH proposal 
not to update the SmPC of lacosamide could be endorsed. 
The benefit risk ratio of LCM treatment remains unchanged. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

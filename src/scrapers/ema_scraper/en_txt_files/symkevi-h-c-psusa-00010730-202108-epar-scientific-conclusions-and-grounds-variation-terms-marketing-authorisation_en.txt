Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tezacaftor / ivacaftor, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
There have been very serious reports of liver failure, transplantation and death in patients with CF and 
advanced liver disease whilst receiving the CFTR modulators ELX/TEZ/IVA (in combination with IVA) 
and LUM/IVA. Given the very serious nature of the events in question, in spite of a lack of specific data for 
TEZ/IVA it is considered that this information should be reflected in the product information of Symkevi in 
order to raise awareness of the potential for worsening of liver function so that patients can be monitored, 
and timely action taken to minimise the risk of serious outcomes.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tezacaftor / ivacaftor the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tezacaftor / ivacaftor is unchanged subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

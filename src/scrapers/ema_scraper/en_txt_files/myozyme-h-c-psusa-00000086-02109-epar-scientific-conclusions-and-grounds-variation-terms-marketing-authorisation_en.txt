Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for alglucosidase alfa, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on infusion associated reactions from clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous 
reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, 
the  PRAC  considers  a  causal  relationship  between  algucosidase  alfa  and  the  following  adverse  drug 
reactions:  dyspepsia,  dysphagia,  transient  skin  discoloration,  blister,  palmar  erythema,  infusion  site 
erythema, infusion site urticaria, and hypoxia, is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded 
that the product information of products containing alglucosidase alfa should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On  the  basis  of  the  scientific  conclusions  for  alglucosidase  alfa  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing alglucosidase alfa is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

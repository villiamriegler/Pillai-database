2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Mepolizumab  is  licensed  in  a  number  of  countries  for  add-on  maintenance  treatment  for  severe 
eosinophilic  asthma  and  for  add-on  maintenance  treatment  for  eosinophilic  granulomatosis  with 
polyangiitis (EGPA). Mepolizumab is available as a powder for solution for subcutaneous (SC) injection, 
and  as  a  solution  for  SC  injection  in  a  pre-filled  pen  [auto-injector  (AI)]  or  pre-filled  syringe  [safety 
syringe device (SSD)]. Mepolizumab is also in development for other eosinophilic indications. 
Disease or condition 
Nasal polyps (NP) develop in the setting of chronic paranasal sinus inflammation and are therefore 
associated with CRS.NP are chronic inflammatory outgrowths of the paranasal sinus mucosa 
(commonly the ethmoid sinuses) that present bilaterally along the middle and superior meatus and 
occur primarily in adults. NP greatly impacts a patient’s health-related quality of life (HRQoL) through 
increases in nasal obstruction, loss of sense of smell, facial pain, facial pressure and nasal discharge; 
and the persistence of these symptoms leads to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).  
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication for use in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
(CRSwNP) as follows: 
Nucala is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of adult 
patients with inadequately controlled severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The prevalence of CRSwNP ranges from 1.1% in the United States of America (USA) and China to 
4.3% in Finland. 
In general, up to 55% of patients with CRSwNP have asthma and the presence of NP increases with 
the severity of asthma. 
According  to the  European  Position  Paper on  Rhinosinusitis  and  NP  which  is consistent  with  the  2007 
American Academy of Otolaryngology guideline the diagnosis of CRS (with or without NP) in adults is 
defined as:  
• 
inflammation of the nose and the paranasal sinuses characterized by two or more symptoms, one 
of  which  should  be  either  nasal  blockage/obstruction/congestion  or  nasal  discharge 
(anterior/posterior nasal drip): 
o  ± facial pain/pressure 
o  ± reduction or loss of smell 
for ≥12 weeks and either 
•  endoscopic signs of: 
o  NP and/or 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 7/129 
 
 
 
 
o  mucopurulent discharge primarily from middle meatus and/or 
o  oedema/mucosal obstruction primarily in middle meatus and/or 
•  Computerised tomography (CT) changes:  
o  mucosal changes within the ostiomeatal complex and/or sinuses 
In addition, the European EPOS 2020 guidance defines disease severity using a total severity VAS: 0-3 
as mild disease, >3-7 as moderate and >7-10 as severe. 
Collectively, symptoms of CRSwNP have a significant impact on HRQoL 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The aetiology of CRSwNP is currently unknown although, in adults, eosinophils are the main 
inflammatory cell in the substantial proportion of NP tissue and are considered potentially responsible 
for the etiopathogenesis and prognosis of the disease. 
In Western countries, the majority of patients with CRSwNP have a type 2 inflammation characterised 
by eosinophilia (~80%) and elevated levels of interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and interleukin-13 
cytokines. 
It should be noted that the aetiology of NP in children appears to be different to that in adults and has 
less correlation with tissue eosinophilia.  
The standard of care (SoC) for CRSwNP in adults is treatment with intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) 
and nasal saline irrigation and, for severe symptoms, intermittent courses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) 
when short term relief is required. 
Dupilumab was approved in the USA in June 2019 and the EU in October 2019 as an add-on therapy to 
SoC in adult patients with CRSwNP. This was the first biologic treatment to be approved in this 
indication. Omalizumab has recently been approved in the EU (July 2020), and is under review in the 
USA, as an add-on therapy to SoC in adult patients with inadequately controlled CRSwNP. 
Surgery to remove the NP tissue may also be indicated for severe cases of CRSwNP. 
Surgery involves the removal of the NP tissue and diseased nasal mucosa, restoring aeration of the 
nasal passage and sinuses. 
A recent meta-analysis of surgery revision rates among patients with CRSwNP reported a mean 
revision rate of 16.2% over a weighted mean follow-up of 89.6 months: rates were higher among 
patients with asthma than without asthma (22.6% vs. 8.0%) and among patients with multiple 
previous surgeries than just one (26.4% vs. 14.3%). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Mepolizumab (NUCALA), a humanized monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin-G1 [IgG1], kappa, mAb), 
binds with high specificity and affinity to human interleukin (IL)-5, the key cytokine responsible for the 
regulation of blood and tissue eosinophils. 
The recommended dose is 100 mg of mepolizumab administered by SC injection once every 4 weeks. 
Mepolizumab can be provided as either 100 mg of lyophilized powder in single-dose vials for 
reconstitution or 100 mg/mL solution in single-dose prefilled AI or SSD.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH did seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP on the 17th of May 2016. (Procedure No.: 
EMEA/H/SA/156/4/2016/III).  
In particular, the MAH previously planned two replicate phase 3 studies with the primary endpoint at 
week 24. This was amended to a single pivotal trial and the timing of the co-primary endpoints 
amended form week 24 to week 52, following discussion with FDA. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.  
No non-clinical studies have been performed. An overview has been provided discussing the 
mechanism of action of mepolizumab to inhibit IL-5 signalling, reducing the production and survival of 
eosinophils and thereby a scientific rationale for potential efficacy in the proposed indication.  
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Being natural proteins, therapeutic antibodies such as mepolizumab, are not excreted unchanged and 
do not give rise to metabolites with potential biological activity. In view of this, guidance on the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00) specifically 
exempts amino acids, peptides and proteins from the need for a complete environmental assessment. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to 
a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of mepolizumab.  
Considering the above data, mepolizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
The weight of evidence from a critical review of non-clinical toxicity data do not raise a concern for new 
indications in proposed dosing regimen and aimed patient population.  
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of mepolizumab.  
Considering the above data, mepolizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
No concerns are raised from non-clinical point of view.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development program for CRSwNP consists of the pivotal Phase III study, 205687, with 
supportive data from the Phase II study MPP111782. 
Study 205687 was a multicentre, Phase III randomised, double-blind, parallel group study which 
investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of 100 mg SC mepolizumab in adult participants with 
CRSwNP receiving SoC therapy.  
Study MPP111782 was a Phase II, two-part (Part A and Part B), randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, multi-centre study to investigate the use of mepolizumab 750mg IV versus placebo in 
reducing the need for surgery in participants with CRSwNP refractory to current Standard of Care. 
Based on the findings from this study, an exposure-response (PK/PD) model was developed and used 
to support the progress to Phase III at a single dose level of mepolizumab 100 mg SC. 
An investigator led study (CRT110178) randomised placebo controlled was also submitted in adult 
patients.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

their respective sample analysis reports and bioanalytical method validation reports is presented below 
in Table 1.

Table 1: List of Bioanalytical Reports, respective validation reports and submission status 
Analytical methods for the evaluation of Mepolizumab Plasma Concentrations.   
The measurement of mepolizumab plasma concentrations for clinical study 205687 was carried out 
using method 111202M01. For clinical study MPP111782, two different validated ELISA methods were 
used.   
These methods are the same as those used during the initial MAA procedures for the lyophilised and 
liquid formulations. For assay runs to be acceptable, no more than one-third of the QC samples could 
deviate from the nominal concentration by more than 20% with %CV ≤ 20%. In addition, at least 50% 
of the results from each QC concentration had to meet the aforementioned criteria for accuracy and 
precision. There are also additional assay acceptance criteria in place for the calibration curve accuracy 
and precision.  
Analytical methods for the evaluation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
The measurement of ADA are the same as those used during the initial MAAs for the lyophilisate and 
the liquid formulations.  
For clinical study 200622, 494 sample clinical sample results are reported. 59 samples screened 
positive (12%) and 9 samples confirmed positive (1.8%). Titers were determined for confirmed 
positive results. The sample analysis report for MPP111782 briefly details the determination of in-study 
cut points from 50 pre-dose subjects. A standard approach was taken for derivation of cut points. 
Details of removal of outliers and assessment of normality are provided. A fixed screening cut point 
was derived based on the upper 95% prediction interval (5% false positive rate) and a 0.1% titration 
cut point was established.  
Given the drug concentrations in the immunogenicity sampling time points for clinical trial MPP111782, 
the ADA assay demonstrates sufficient drug tolerance to detect ADA. Only 7 out of 53 subjects had 
immunogenicity samples that contained greater than 100 µg/ml mepolizumab (drug tolerance of the 
assay) and the applicant describes only one potential false negative .The drug concentrations in the 
immunogenicity sample time points are presented for study 205687 and serum levels of mepolizumab 
were below the tolerance of the assay. 
Analytical methods for the evaluation of neutralising antibodies (NAb) 
The measurement of NAb for clinical study 205687 was carried out using the electrochemiluminescent 
(ECL) as bridging assay. In brief, quality controls and human serum samples were incubated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 12/129 
 
 
 
 
mepolizumab and biotinylated recombinant human IL-5 (bio IL-5). The samples are then transferred to 
a previously blocked streptavidin-coated MSD plate and a sulfo-tab labelled anti-human IgG1 is added. 
After washing the MSD plate, read buffer is added. In the absence of NAbs in the sample, the complex 
consisting of bio IL-5, mepolizumab and sulfo-tagged anti-IgG1 will results in an ECL signal. However, 
if the sample contains NAbs, then the ECL signal is reduced. Any sample with a %response less than or 
equal to the cutpoint (i.e., ≤85.75%), as determined during method validation, is determined as 
positive for NAbs.  
A summary of the method validation is presented below in Table 2.

The measurement of NAb for clinical study MPP111782 was same NAb assay used for the initial 
lyophilisate and liquid formulations.  
Absorption 
Mepolizumab subcutaneous absorption is slow, with a Tmax of 4 to 8 days. In healthy subjects, the 
absolute bioavailability of a single dose of SC mepolizumab ranged from 64%–75%, across 
administration sites (abdomen, thigh, upper arm). In a repeat dose study in moderate/severe 
asthmatic subjects, the SC absolute bioavailability was 74%, and in a Phase III severe asthma study 
was 80%. 
Distribution 
Mepolizumab distributes into a volume of approximately plasma and interstitial space (55 to 85 
mL/kg).  
Elimination 
Mepolizumab is catabolized by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes and does not undergo target-mediated 
clearance. 
Mepolizumab is eliminated with a systemic clearance of 1.9-3.3 mL/day/kg and has a SC terminal-
phase elimination half-life of 20 days, with two-fold accumulation following repeat dosing every four 
weeks, consistent with the long half-life. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab are linear, dose-proportional, and time-independent after both 
intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study MPP111782 (Supportive Phase IIa Study) 
This was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adult 
subjects with severe bilateral NP. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to receive mepolizumab IV 750 mg or 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 15/129 
 
 
 
 
placebo every 4 weeks over a period of 24 weeks. Sparse PK samples were collected throughout the 
study. 
A total of 52 subjects contributed 461 mepolizumab PK samples. All concentration-time profiles were 
analysed using a previously established population PK model with 2 compartments and IV bolus input. 
Bodyweight was incorporated into the model as a fixed effect with conventional fixed allometric scaling 
powers of unity for volume and 0.75 for clearance.  
Mepolizumab 750 mg IV showed expected PK, consistent with previous analyses, with bodyweight-
adjusted clearance of 0.22 L/day, volume of distribution at steady-state of 7.1 L, distribution half-life 
of 1.5 days, and a t½ of 24 days. 
No subjects in the mepolizumab treatment group tested positive for anti-mepolizumab antibodies. 
Study 205687 
In the pivotal Phase III 205687 study, adult patients with CRSwNP were randomised 1:1 to receive 
either mepolizumab SC 100 mg or placebo SC treatments every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. Sparse PK 
samples were collected pre-dose at Baseline, Week 4, Week 52 and Week 68, and, when applicable 
early withdrawal (EW). 
In order to investigate whether mepolizumab PK in adults with CRSwNP was similar to other 
eosinophilic conditions, the most recent meta-analysis population PK model was applied directly to the 
dataset of Study 205687 without modification and without parameter estimation. Observations from 
Study 205687 and model predictions were then subjected to statistical goodness of fit tests to assess 
the degree of comparability. 
The effect of prospectively selected covariates on mepolizumab exposure was evaluated graphically 
(PK parameters vs. covariates), and formally using a forward/backward approach. Albumin was not 
collected in this study and was set to previous population mean of 44 g/L.  
Results 
Of the 206 participants randomised to the mepolizumab group, 202 contributed 434 concentrations to 
the analysis. No additional covariates beyond the ones already included in the model (bodyweight and 
creatinine clearance) were identified. Goodness of fit plots are shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. 
A Visual Predictive Check (VPC) is presented in Figure 4.

Concordance between the predicted and observed plasma concentrations in the study was evaluated 
using the following goodness of fit tests: Shapiro-Wilks, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von-Mises and 
Anderson-Darling. There was no evidence to suggest, at the 5% significance level, that observations 
and model predictions were drawn from different distributions (Figure 5). It was therefore concluded 
that the existing population PK model was able to accurately predict 100 mg SC mepolizumab plasma 
concentrations in participants with nasal polyposis.

participant (1%, 1/183) in the placebo and 6 participants (3%, 6/196) in the mepolizumab group 
tested positive for emergent ADAs. None of the participants were positive for NAbs. There was no 
evidence that anti-drug antibodies influenced mepolizumab exposure (Figure 6).

Special populations 
No conventional clinical pharmacology studies were conducted due to the nature of the molecule, its 
mechanism of action and elimination pathways. Dose adjustments in special populations other than 
children (i.e., elderly, renal- and hepatic-impaired subjects) are not required. 
Age, race, gender and disease have not been identified as covariates of mepolizumab exposure across 
indications. In the population PK analysis (Study 205687), there was an increase in clearance was 
noted with increasing bodyweight in adults with CRSwNP. Systemic clearance (CL) by bodyweight 
category defined as ≤70 kg, >70 to ≤85 kg and >85 kg is presented Figure 7.

Figure 7: Box Plot of Systematic Clearance versus Bodyweight 
The effect of bodyweight on mepolizumab exposure was comparable with the previous population PK 
model; the predicted exposure ratio for 40 vs. 70 kg was 1.47 (95% CI 1.17, 1.84), 70 vs. 120 kg was 
0.69 (95% CI 0.55, 0.86) and 70 vs. 160 kg was 0.57 (95% CI 0.40, 0.79).

2.3.1.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Mepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa) that blocks interleukin-5 (IL-5) from 
binding to the IL-5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits 
signaling, resulting in the reduction in production and survival of eosinophils. 
Nasal polyposis is an eosinophil-mediated disease; eosinophils are the most common infiltrating 
inflammatory cells in nasal polyps with eosinophils being prominent in over 80% of polyps in European 
nasal polyposis patients [Fokkens, 2007; Stoop, 1993]. Overproduction of IL-5 has been reported in 
patients with a variety of eosinophilic associated disorders; therefore, anti-IL-5 therapy is a potential 
therapeutic target for the treatment of eosinophil-mediated diseases such as nasal polyposis. 
Primary pharmacology 
Study MPP111782 
A marked decrease in eosinophils in the mepolizumab group was observed over the course of the 
study, which was apparent as early as Week 2. At Week 25, the median ratio to baseline was 0.10 for 
mepolizumab and 0.93 for placebo.  
Study 205687 
In adult subjects with CRSwNP from the pivotal Phase III study 205687, geometric mean blood 
eosinophil counts at baseline were similar in both treatment groups (0.39 GI/L and 0.40 GI/L in the 
mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively). In the mepolizumab group, the geometric mean blood 
eosinophil count was reduced to 0.08 GI/L by Week 4 and remained at this level until Week 52 (0.06 
GI/L).  
The reduction in blood eosinophil counts was statistically significantly greater in the mepolizumab 
group compared with the placebo group at every 4-week timepoint, with an 81% reduction at Week 4 
(ratio: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.22; p<0.001) which was maintained through an 83% reduction at Week 
52 (ratio: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.19; p<0.001) (Figure 8).

Population) 
Secondary pharmacology 
Mepolizumab does not bind to the hERG channel and QT-mediated proarrhythmia due to blockade is 
not a concern with mAbs due to their very high molecular weight. In clinical studies there were no 
adverse effects on cardiac conduction or repolarisation at doses in excess of the proposed marketed 
dose in the various indications. Furthermore, a concentration-response analysis did not show any 
effects of mepolizumab on QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc). A thorough QTc study has not 
therefore been conducted. 
2.3.2.  PK/PD modelling 
Study MPP111782 
A total of 104 subjects contributed 673 pharmacodynamic samples.  
An Imax direct response model was fitted to serial blood eosinophil count data from both mepolizumab 
and placebo treatment using model-predicted mepolizumab concentrations, on account of the rapid 
eosinophil dynamics (compared with PK). Consistent with previous analyses, baseline blood eosinophil 
count was included as the only covariate and baseline and maximum inhibitory effect were modelled as 
random effects. The concentration associated with 50% of the maximal effect (IC50) was estimated at 
4.4 μg/mL and maximum inhibition at 90.1%. 
The IC50 of 4.4 μg/mL is higher than estimates in previous analyses, which might reflect the higher 
baseline blood eosinophil count in this study that was observed in absence of inhaled and oral 
corticosteroids compared with previous studies in other eosinophilic conditions.

Study 205687 
A PK/PD analysis was conducted to investigate whether the blood eosinophil response to mepolizumab 
treatment in patients with CRSwNP was consistent with the response observed in patients with other 
eosinophilic conditions. 407 adults with CRSwNP from the pivotal Phase III study 205687 were 
included in the PKPD dataset. Post-hoc individual predicted mepolizumab concentrations were merged 
with blood eosinophil count data before model fitting. 
The most recent meta-analysis population PKPD model was applied directly to the dataset without 
parameter estimation. An additional class of nasal polyposis for the fixed effect of disease on baseline 
blood eosinophil count was, however, added to the model in order to capture more specifically the 
baseline blood eosinophil count in subjects with CRSwNP. 
The impact of covariates on individual parameter estimates was examined graphically and formally 
using a forward/backward approach. No additional covariates beyond that already included in the 
model [baseline blood eosinophil count effect on baseline blood eosinophil count (KRO) and maximum 
effect (Imax)] were identified. 
Goodness of fit plots are shown in Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11

Concordance between the predicted and observed blood eosinophil counts in the study was evaluated 
using the following goodness of fit tests: Kolmogorov-Smirnov (location), Cramér–von Mises (tails of 
the distribution) and Anderson-Darling (tails of the distribution). In contrast to the PK analysis, there 
was evidence to suggest, at the 5% significance level, that observations and model predictions were 
drawn from different distributions (Figure 12 and Figure 13), possibly reflecting the different disease 
population and large sample size.

participants with nasal polyposis.

Individual exposure, measured by both weight-based dose (i.e., mg/kg) and average concentration 
(defined as Cav = dose/(clearance(L/d) x 28day dosing interval)) was estimated from screening 
bodyweight and posterior-predicted individual clearance. Individuals were ranked by exposure quartile 
(0 = placebo, 1 – 4 for mepolizumab) and data merged with efficacy data for Total Endoscopic Score 
and VAS, and change from baseline plotted by exposure quartile (Figure 15). Analysis by quantile 
regression showed no significant effect of exposure on clinical response beyond treatment as a class 
effect, implying that mepolizumab exposure and blood eosinophil inhibition achieved by 100 mg SC 
Q28D is optimal for response.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical development program for CRSwNP consists of the pivotal Phase III study, 205687, with 
supportive data from the Phase II study MPP111782. 
Bioanalytical methods 
For clinical studies 205687 and MPP111782, plasma concentrations of mepolizumab were determined 
using the same methods as were used during the initial MAA procedures for the lyophilised and liquid 
formulations. All samples were analyzed within the demonstrated storage stability parameters 
established in GSK and Alliance Pharma. The sample analysis reports confirm acceptable assay 
performance. The results of incurred samples reanalysis confirm the acceptability and reproducibility of 
the assays (at least two thirds of re-assayed samples were within ± 30% of their initial result). No 
sample was repeated in the study 205687. The MAH had requested confirmation reanalysis for 23 
study samples from the study MPP111782. However, due to the constraints of established stability 
parameters, 12 of these samples were not able to be repeated. Eleven samples out of 572 samples 
were repeated to confirm results. This approach is fully acceptable as this study MPP111782 is not 
bioequivalence study and thus is not threatened by suspicious adjustment of results.  
For clinical studies 205687 and MPP111782, ADA were determined using the same method(s) used 
during the initial MAA procedures for the lyophilised and liquid formulations. The sample analysis 
reports are provided for the clinical studies and confirm acceptable assay performance. For analysis of 
samples from clinical study 205687, 39 out of 43 runs met the acceptance criteria. For analysis of 
samples from MPP111782, 25 out of 28 runs met the acceptance criteria.  
For clinical study 205687, 917 sample results are reported. 126 samples screened positive (screening 
positive rate of 13.7%) and 16 samples confirmed positive (true positive rate of 1.7%). Titers were 
established for the confirmed positive results.  
For clinical study 200622, 494 sample clinical sample results are reported. 59 samples screened 
positive (12%) and 9 samples confirmed positive (1.8%). Titers were determined for confirmed 
positive results. The sample analysis report for MPP111782 briefly details the determination of in-study 
cut points from 50 pre-dose subjects. A standard approach was taken for derivation of cut points. 
Details of removal of outliers and assessment of normality are provided. A fixed screening cut point 
was derived based on the upper 95% prediction interval (5% false positive rate) and a 0.1% titration 
cut point was established.  
Given the drug concentrations in the immunogenicity sampling time points for clinical trial MPP111782, 
the ADA assay demonstrates sufficient drug tolerance to detect ADA. Only 7 out of 53 subjects had 
immunogenicity samples that contained greater than 100 µg/ml mepolizumab (drug tolerance of the 
assay) and the applicant describes only one potential false negative. The drug concentrations in the 
immunogenicity sample time points are presented for study 205687 and serum levels of mepolizumab 
were below the tolerance of the assay. 
The measurement of NAb for clinical study 205687 was carried out using the electrochemiluminescent 
(ECL) method M1707047 (version 3). Appropriate assay validity criteria have been defined for the 
method. In general, the method has been validated in line with the Guideline on bioanalytical method 
validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 rev.1) and the Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of 
biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006). Data has been 
presented to support the specificity and selectivity (lack of matrix interference) for the method. This 
assay has similar sensitivity and improved drug tolerance with reference to the previously used assay. 
The screening assay cut point was determined using 50 normal human serum samples. A standard 
approach was taken for derivation of cut point. Details of removal of outliers and assessment of 
Assessment report

normality are provided. A fixed screening cut point (85.75%) was derived using the parametric method 
(1% false positive rate).  
For clinical study 205687, 16 ADA positive samples were screened to assess for Nab. A total of 1 run 
was analysed and met the assay acceptance criteria confirming acceptable assay performance. All 16 
samples were determined to be negative for NAbs.  
The measurement of NAb for clinical study MPP111782 was carried out the same NAb assay as was 
used for the original lyophilisate and liquid formulations. Using 50 pre-dose individuals from study 
MPP111782 a fixed screening cut point was determined. A standard approach is described for 
derivation of the cut point. Based on a one-sided low 99% prediction interval, and the exclusion of high 
CV samples, the in-study assay cut point of (87.46%) was established. The method for exclusion of 
outliers is described and is acceptable. 
The NAb assay is susceptible to drug interference. Earlier time points during ADA sampling 
demonstrated drug concentrations greater than 10 µg/ml mepolizumab. Confirmed ADA positive 
samples would likely be negative in the NAb assay of such samples. Across the entire mepolizumab 
clinical program, only one participant was positive for neutralising antibodies (study MEA115575) and 
this individual did not have detectable levels of drug in their serum samples (due to reduction in free 
drug as a result of the strong ADA response). Thus, it is argued that while the NAb assay has limited 
drug tolerance it is sufficient to detect neutralising antibodies in the event of a strong ADA response. 
Taking into account the low immunogenicity of mepolizumab (low % confirmed ADA positive samples), 
this point will not be further pursued. 
Study MPP111782 
Mepolizumab 750 mg IV demonstrated expected PK in adults with severe bilateral NP, supporting the 
view that disease is not a covariate of mepolizumab exposure. No subjects treated with mepolizumab 
developed anti-drug antibodies, which is consistent with the low immunogenic potential of 
mepolizumab observed in other indications. 
There was a profound reduction in blood eosinophil count with similar maximum inhibition of 90.1% as 
previously observed in other eosinophilic conditions. 
Study 205687 
After mepolizumab SC dose of 100 mg was administered to adult subjects with CRSwNP, mepolizumab 
PK data was analysed using the most recent meta-analysis population PK model without modification 
and without parameterisation. No additional covariates beyond those already included in the model 
(body weight, creatinine clearance) were identified. The analysis showed that the PK of mepolizumab 
in adults with CRSwNP is consistent with that of patients with other eosinophilic conditions and that 
CRSwNP disease is not a determinant of mepolizumab exposure. 
6 participants (3%, 6/196) in the mepolizumab group tested positive for emergent ADAs and had 
detectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies after having received at least one dose of mepolizumab. None 
of the participants were positive for NAbs. There was no evidence that anti-drug antibodies influenced 
mepolizumab exposure. The findings support the low immunogenic potential of mepolizumab however, 
this information is provided to the prescribers in section 5.1. of the SmPC. 
Mepolizumab 100 mg SC in adult patients with CRSwNP resulted in a marked reduction in blood 
eosinophils early in treatment, which was sustained throughout the study. The magnitude of blood 
eosinophil count reduction was consistent with subjects with other eosinophilic conditions.  
The most recent meta-analysis population PK/PD model was applied directly to the PK/PD data 
collected from adults with CRSwNP in study 205687, without adjustment except for a fixed effect 
Assessment report

disease parameter for baseline blood eosinophil count to better capture the baseline in subjects with 
nasal polyposis. The GOF plots indicated that, in contrast to PK, the PKPD model did not fit the 
CRSwNP data particularly well, which was confirmed by the GOF statistical tests. This suggests that the 
PD response to mepolizumab in subjects with CRSwNP may not be similar to other eosinophilic 
conditions. The VPC showed that the model predicted the reduction in eosinophil count with 
mepolizumab treatment reasonably well, but there appears to be a tendency for over prediction of 
eosinophil counts. Thus, the applicant’s conclusion that the existing model adequately predicts blood 
eosinophil counts in participants with nasal polyposis is not necessarily agreed. However, a single dose 
level was tested in the pivotal phase III study and no extrapolation to any other dose level or patient 
population is foreseen. Therefore, this issue is not pursued as it is unlikely to impact on the benefit risk 
assessment. 
Based on the exposure response analysis, at the single dose of 100 mg SC Q4W investigated in the 
study 205687, there was no evidence of increased efficacy with increased mepolizumab exposure 
(individual weight-based dose or average plasma concentration). 
Special populations 
It is agreed that dose adjustments in special populations (i.e., elderly, renal- and hepatic-impaired 
subjects) are not warranted for adult patients with nasal polyposis. It is also agreed that a dose 
adjustment based on body weight is not warranted for adult patients with nasal polyposis. Despite a 
decrease in mepolizumab exposure with increasing body weight, the magnitude of the effect in adults 
with CRSwNP was comparable to other indications and not considered to be clinically relevant. This is 
supported by the efficacy exposure response analysis, which showed that mepolizumab exposure is not 
a significant predictor of clinical response in CRSwNP after adjusting for treatment effect.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of mepolizumab has been sufficiently characterised for the extension of 
indication to include Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP) in adults.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
As mentioned earlier, the clinical development program for CRSwNP consists of the pivotal Phase III 
study, 205687, with supportive data from the Phase II study MPP111782 (Table 4).

2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response studies were conducted.  
The proposed dose of 100 mg SC in NP in this study is supported by data from several studies: 
•  Clinical efficacy of mepolizumab in participants with NP has only been investigated at a supra-
pharmacological dose of 750 mg IV Q4W to date, although participants were followed for six 
months of washout. 
• 
• 
Two studies in participants with severe asthma MEA112997 and MEA114092 provided evidence 
of a dose response to suppression of blood eosinophil count. 
In study MEA112997, the lowest dose of 75 mg IV (equivalent to the proposed 100 mg SC 
dose) gave 78% inhibition. 
•  Higher doses of 250 mg IV and 750 mg IV provided only modest increases in suppression 
(86% and 88%, respectively) indicating that the lowest dose provides approximately 90% of 
maximal pharmacological response attributable to drug. 
A subsequent clinical pharmacology study MEA114092 confirmed equivalence of the SC route of 
administration and identified the half-maximal pharmacological dose of 11 mg SC, consistent with 
study MEA112997.

EMA/560926/2021  
Page 31/129 
 
 
 
The approved severe asthma dosing regimen of 100 mg SC dose Q4W provides 55% overlap with 750 
mg IV data when given 4-weekly. 
Since initiation of the NP Phase II program, a meta-analysis of mepolizumab blood eosinophil exposure 
and dose response across all indications has been conducted to investigate the role disease plays in 
mepolizumab response. When examined, the distribution of baseline eosinophil count (BEC) in 
participants enrolled in the Phase II NP studies was broadly similar to that seen in the severe asthma 
program after adjustment for inhaled and oral corticosteroid usage, and hence the exposure and dose 
responses for other diseases are predictive of NP. This finding was confirmed using BEC data from the 
Phase II NP study MPP111782. These data were predicted independently using a physiological 
exposure-response model of mepolizumab binding to IL-5, coupled to IL-5 action on BEC. After 
validation, the model was used to simulate alternative dosing regimens of interest in patients with NP, 
and then estimate the degree of pharmacological overlap 100 mg and 300 mg SC doses have with the 
tested 750 mg IV Q4W regimen for a range of dosing frequencies. Results show considerable overlap 
between monthly doses of 100 mg and 300 mg SC and the tested 750 mg IV Q4W. 
There was no dose-response study in the clinical development.

Title of Study : Study 205687 (Synapse) 
 A randomised, double-blind, parallel group PhIII study to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of 100 
mg SC Mepolizumab as an add on to maintenance treatment in adults with severe bilateral nasal 
polyps - SYNAPSE (StudY in NAsal Polyps patients to assess the Safety and Efficacy of mepolizumab) 
Methods 
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to assess the clinical 
efficacy and safety of 100 mg SC mepolizumab as an add-on to maintenance treatment in adults with 
CRSwNP.  
The objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mepolizumab 100 mg, administered SC by the 
Investigator or delegate via a pre-filled safety syringe every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The co-primary 
endpoints were change from baseline in endoscopic NP score at Week 52 and change from baseline in 
nasal obstruction VAS symptom score during the 4 weeks prior to Week 52.

Figure 16: Study Schematic  
The study comprised of a 4-week run-in period, followed by a 52-week treatment period (Figure 16). 
Participants received a total of thirteen, 4-weekly doses of mepolizumab 100 mg or placebo, delivered 
by SC injection using a pre-filled safety syringe. The final dose of study treatment was administered at 
Week 48. Participants who withdrew from study treatment prematurely were encouraged to remain in 
the study per protocol until Week 52. Participants who completed the Week 52 assessment were 
considered to have completed the study. 
In addition, it was planned for up to the first 200 randomised participants to enter a 6-month no-
treatment follow-up period following their Week 52 visit in order to assess maintenance of response 
and to validate a physiological model derived from the previous Phase II study (MPP111782). 
Participants who completed the Week 76 visit were considered to have completed the no treatment 
follow-up period. 
A total of 86 sites in 11 countries randomised participants: 24 sites in the United States (US), 11 sites 
in Argentina, 9 sites in Germany, 9 sites in the Russian Federation, 8 sites in the United Kingdom (UK), 
7 sites in Canada, 5 sites in Sweden, 4 sites in Australia, 4 sites in the Republic of Korea, 4 sites in

Treatments 
All participants were on SoC for CRSwNP throughout the study (run-in, treatment and no-treatment 
follow-up periods), which consisted of daily mometasone furoate nasal spray (MF), and if required, 
saline nasal douching, occasional short courses of high dose OCS and/or antibiotics. At the start of run-
in and throughout the study, participants were placed on MF at the maximum prescribed dose (if not 
already) according to local label, if available, or in line with local SoC. The maximum dose was 2 
actuations (50 mcg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily which equalled a total daily dose of 400 mcg. 
For participants intolerant to this dose, the lower dose of 200 mcg could have been used (2 actuations 
[50 mcg/actuation] in each nostril once daily). 
Concomitant medications excluded:

Objectives   
Primary objective : To evaluate the efficacy of 100mg mepolizumab compared to placebo 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint : 
•  Change from baseline in total endoscopic NP score at week 52 
•  Change from baseline in mean nasal obstruction VAS score during the 4 weeks prior to week 
52. 
Secondary endpoints 
• 
Time to first nasal surgery up to week 52. 
•  Change from baseline in mean overall VAS symptom score during the 4 weeks prior to week 
52. 
•  Change from baseline in SNOT-22 total score at week 52. 
• 
Proportion of participants requiring systemic steroids for nasal polyps up to week 52. 
•  Change from baseline in the mean composite VAS score (combining VAS scores for nasal 
obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat and loss of smell) during the 4 weeks prior to 
week 52. 
•  Change from baseline in the mean individual VAS symptom score for loss of smell during the 4 
weeks prior to week 52. 
Endoscopic nasal score 
Endoscopic NP assessment was performed at the site by trained heath care staff (usually an ear, nose 
and throat [ENT] surgeon). The image recordings of these nasal endoscopies were sent to a central lab 
for blinded assessment by a centralised team of qualified and experienced ENT surgeons. 
For endoscopies conducted at Screening, Randomisation (Baseline) and Week 52 (the primary 
endpoint), two independent members of the centralised team reviewed and recorded an endoscopic 
nasal polyp score. If the scores were in agreement, this value was considered the final score for the 
central read. If the scores were not in agreement, a third assessor was consulted and this adjudicator 
would decide between the two assessor's scores to provide a final score. 
The total endoscopic NP score was the sum of the right and left nostril scores, with a range of 0-8; 
higher scores indicating worse status. A responder was defined as a participant who, in the absence of 
surgery/sinuplasty, achieved a ≥1-point improvement (decrease) from baseline in total endoscopic NP 
score (based on centrally read data) at a given timepoint. 
For the purposes of randomisation, the site was notified if the central read of the Screening 
assessment was scored at ≥5 out of a maximum score of 8 (with a minimum score of 2 in each nasal 
cavity) (i.e. if the participant met the inclusion criteria).

Table 5: Description of Nasal Polyp Score 
Symptoms Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
A VAS was used to collect participant perceived symptom data for the co-primary endpoint of nasal 
obstruction. VAS was also used to collect data on overall symptoms (a secondary endpoint), loss of 
smell (a secondary endpoint), nasal discharge, mucus in the throat and facial pain. 
The nasal symptoms composite score, a secondary endpoint, combined the individual scores of nasal 
obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in throat and loss of smell. The nasal symptoms and facial pain 
composite score, another endpoint, combined the individual scores of nasal obstruction, nasal 
discharge, mucus in throat, loss of smell and facial pain 
All scales used in the study were presented on the eDiary and were collected daily in the morning from 
screening to the end of the study period. Participants were instructed on how to complete the VAS 
prior to first use. 
Every day, the participant was asked to indicate on a VAS the severity of 5 nasal polyposis symptoms 
(one VAS for each symptom) and symptoms overall: 
Please rate your “___________” at its worst over the previous 24 hours 
1. nasal obstruction; 2. nasal discharge; 3. feeling of mucus in the throat; 4. loss of smell; 5. facial 
pain; 6. nasal polyps symptoms.

Other endpoints 
Nasal Polyp surgery 
As an endpoint, for the purpose of this study, NP surgery was defined as any procedure involving 
instruments resulting in incision and removal of tissue (polypectomy) in the nasal cavity. Dilatation of 
the air passages in the nasal cavity (e.g. balloon sinuplasty) was not included in this endpoint. 
Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PnIF) 
Nasal peak inspiratory flow (NPIF) evaluation represents a physiologic measure of the air flow through 
both nasal cavities during forced inspiration expressed in liters per minute. A PnIF meter was used to 
derive forced inspiratory peak flow through the nose during the study according to the schedule of 
activities (SoA). PnIF was measured using an IN-CHECK flow meter. 
Olfaction testing: University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) 
UPSIT is a commercially available kit to measure an individual's ability to detect odours at a 
suprathreshold level. It is the gold standard of smell identification tests for its reliability and 
practicality. 
Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Assessments 
•  Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) Questionnaire 
SNOT-22 is a 22-item self-reported questionnaire developed to measure symptoms and impacts 
related to chronic rhinosinusitis. The questions are self-completed by the participant based on their 
recall of their symptoms over the past 2 weeks. The possible response to each question ranges from 0 
(no problem) to 5 (the problem is as bad as it can be). The score for each question is added to give 
the final SNOT-22 score, which has a theoretical range of 0 to 110, with a higher score indicating a 
greater impact of the disease state on the participant’s health-related quality of life. The MCID for this 
instrument is a ≥ 8.9 change in SNOT-22 score. 
•  Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) 
The ACQ-5 is a five-item questionnaire. The five questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity 
of symptoms over the previous week (nocturnal awakening due to symptoms, symptoms on waking in 
the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath, and wheeze). The response options for all these 
questions range from 0 (no impairment/limitation) to 6 (total impairment/ limitation). 
The score for each question is averaged to give the final ACQ-5 score, which has a theoretical range of 
0 to 6. A score of ≤ 0.75 indicates well-controlled asthma and a score ≥1.5 indicates poorly controlled 
asthma. The MCID for this instrument is a ≥0.5 decrease in total score. 
Sample size 
This study was designed to test the superiority of mepolizumab versus placebo. 
The sample size calculations were based on the co-primary efficacy endpoints of total endoscopic nasal 
polyp score and nasal obstruction VAS score at Week 52 and the key secondary endpoint of time to 
actual surgery. A study of 200 participants per treatment group was estimated to have over 90% 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 38/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
power to observe statistical significance at the two-sided 5% level for both co-primary endpoints and 
for the key secondary endpoint of time to actual surgery. 
The calculation for the co-primary endpoints was based on analysis of study MPP111782. This analysis 
showed 27% of placebo participants with a one-point improvement in NP score compared to 52% of 
mepolizumab participants. For nasal blockage, 39% of placebo participants showed a one-point 
improvement in NP score compared to 70% of mepolizumab participants. 
For surgery, 90% power to observe statistical significance at the two-sided 5% level is based on a true 
reduction in the proportion of participants receiving surgery from 40% on placebo to 25% on 
mepolizumab. In the six-month study MPP111782, 20% of participants on placebo and 9% of 
participants on mepolizumab received surgery; a greater proportion of participants receiving surgery 
was expected in this twelve-month study. 
The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statistically significant difference between 
treatment groups was a reduction in the proportion of participants receiving surgery from 40% on 
placebo to 30% on mepolizumab. 
Randomisation 
The randomisation was stratified by country. Participants were assigned to study treatment through an 
interactive response technology (IRT), the Registration and Medication Ordering System Next 
Generation (RAMOS NG) in accordance with the randomisation schedule. 
Blinding (masking) 
Mepolizumab and placebo were identical in appearance (blinded, pre-filled safety syringes). Treatment 
was administered by a blinded member of the site staff. The blinding of those involved in the 
evaluation of the study, i.e., physician, nurse and participant was maintained at all times. 
Post-randomisation, the site staff and central study team were blinded to each participant’s eosinophil 
count (including white blood count differential). 
Treatment codes could be unblinded by the investigator or treating physician only in the case of a 
medical emergency or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of the 
investigational product was essential for the clinical management or welfare of the participant. The 
MAH Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff could unblind treatment codes in the 
event of a serious adverse event (SAE). 
Protocol Amendments 
Four amendments were made to the protocol. Protocol Amendment 1 was made prior to FPFV (25 May 
2017) and applied only to sites in South Korea. Protocol Amendments 2 and 3 were made after FPFV 
and applied to all sites. Protocol Amendment 4 was made after LPLV (11 December 2019) but before 
unbinding and related to the analysis of data. 
• 
• 
Protocol Amendment 1 was approved on 15 May 2017, before FPFV. The amendment was 
made to support country-specific requirements and amendments for South Korea. The changes 
included the IP label, provided additional clarification about the inclusion criteria age as per 
local regulations and provided details of OCS supplied for South Korea 
Protocol Amendment 2 was approved on 14 July 2017, 2 months after FPFV. The main purpose 
of this amendment was to reflect comments from investigators to clarify points in the protocol 
that might be confusing or inconsistent. In addition, it also reflected the removal of CT scans 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 39/129 
 
 
 
and exit interviews as well as simplifying some of the endpoints such as reduction of 
endoscopic NP endpoints. 
• 
• 
Protocol Amendment 3 was approved on 20 February 2018, 9 months after FPFV. The purpose 
of this amendment was to clarify that screen failure could also be re-screened (not just run-in 
failures) and that the ECG machine did not need to be automated. 
Protocol Amendment 4 was approved on 13 February 2020, 2 months after LPLV and prior to 
unblinding. In order to reflect regulatory authority feedback, the protocol was amended to: 
- update the analysis methodology for the co-primary endpoints, including imputation rules such that 
participants with surgery/sinuplasty prior to Week 52 were assigned their worst observed value 
(endoscopic NP score or nasal obstruction VAS score, as appropriate) prior to surgery/sinuplasty. 
- limit the definition of surgery for the key secondary endpoint to include only events involving 
instruments resulting in incision and removal of tissue (polypectomy) in the nasal cavity. Dilatation of 
the air passages (e.g. balloon sinuplasty) if carried out alone were not considered as an event of 
surgery. 
- update the OCS endpoint to the proportion of participants requiring systemic steroids for nasal polyps 
instead of the total burden of systemic steroids. 
- include two additional secondary endpoints of composite nasal symptoms score and loss of smell 
symptom score that was previously included as ‘other’ endpoints.

The primary estimand compared mepolizumab 100 mg SC to placebo for the co-primary endpoints of: 
•  Change from Baseline in total ENP score at Week 52 (based on centrally read data) 
•  Change from Baseline in mean nasal obstruction VAS score during the 4 weeks prior to Week 
52 
A composite strategy was used for the intercurrent event of surgery/sinuplasty, such that the 
occurrence of surgery/sinuplasty was incorporated into the definition of the endpoint. 
Participants who had surgery/sinuplasty prior to Week 52 were assigned their worst observed score 
prior to the surgery/sinuplasty.  
A treatment policy strategy was used for the intercurrent event of discontinuation of study medication. 
The study was designed to continue collecting data for participants who prematurely discontinued from 
randomised treatment and all data reported were included in the primary analysis regardless of 
discontinuation from treatment. Missing data from participants who withdrew from study before Week 
52 without having experienced surgery/sinuplasty; these participants were assigned their worst 
observed  
Score prior to study withdrawal. 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population was the primary population for efficacy analyses and consisted of 
all randomised participants who received at least one dose of study medication. 
For each co-primary endpoint, the p-value for comparing the treatment groups was based on the non-
parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The difference in median change from Baseline with 95% 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021

confidence intervals (CIs) was estimated by quantile regression using a bootstrap approach with 
covariates of treatment group, region, Baseline score and loge Baseline blood eosinophil count. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint, time to first nasal surgery up to Week 52, was analysed by a Cox 
proportional hazards model with covariates of treatment group, region, Baseline total ENP score 
(centrally read data), Baseline nasal obstruction VAS, loge 
Baseline blood eosinophil count and number of previous surgeries for NP (1, 2, >2; ordinal). A 
treatment policy strategy was used for the intercurrent event of discontinuation of study medication. 
Statistical Analyses of other secondary endpoints 
•  Change from Baseline in VAS symptom scores 
•  Change from baseline in mean overall VAS symptom score during the 4 weeks prior to Week 
52 
•  Change from baseline in SNOT-22 total score at Week 52. 
• 
Proportion of participants requiring systemic steroids for nasal polyps up to Week 52. 
•  Change from baseline in the mean composite VAS score (combining VAS scores for nasal 
obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat and loss of smell) during the 4 weeks prior to 
Week 52. 
•  Change from baseline in mean individual VAS symptom score for loss of smell during the 4 
weeks prior to Week 52. 
Change from Baseline in VAS symptom scores; Change from baseline in SNOT-22 total score at Week 
52; Change from baseline in the mean composite VAS score (combining VAS scores for nasal 
obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat and loss of smell) during the 4 weeks prior to Week 
52 and change from baseline in mean individual VAS symptom score for loss of smell during the 4 
weeks prior to Week 52 were analysed using non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Quantile 
regression methods. 
For the analysis of the proportion of participants requiring systemic steroids for nasal polyps, a logistic 
regression model was used to compare the proportion of participants requiring a course of systemic 
steroids between the treatment groups. The odds ratio comparing treatment groups was estimated 
using the observed marginal distribution of the sample covariates. The analysis model included 
covariates of treatment group, region, number of OCS courses for NP in last 12 months (0, 1, >1; 
ordinal), baseline total endoscopic NP score (based on centrally read data), baseline nasal obstruction 
VAS score and loge baseline blood eosinophil. 
For the co-primary endpoints posthoc analyses were performed using a composite strategy for the 
intercurrent event of surgery where participants with surgery were assigned the worst possible score 
rather than their own worst observed score. Differences between treatments in mean scores were 
estimated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) and multiple imputation methods were used 
for missing data, firstly using missing at random (MAR) imputation and secondly imputing values using 
available ‘off-treatment’ data collected from participants who discontinued randomized treatment but 
continued in the trial. 
Results 
All primary and secondary endpoints achieved statistical significance at the two-sided 5% level 
adjusted for multiplicity. In order to provide strong control of type I error when making inferences for 
the pre-defined secondary endpoints, multiplicity was controlled using a hierarchical closed testing 
approach.

Recruitment 
A total of 86 sites in 11 countries randomised participants: 24 sites in the United States (US), 11 sites 
in Argentina, 9 sites in Germany, 9 sites in the Russian Federation, 8 sites in the United Kingdom (UK), 
7 sites in Canada, 5 sites in Sweden, 4 sites in Australia, 4 sites in the Republic of Korea, 4 sites in 
Romania and 1 site in the Netherlands.  
The trial was initiated on the 25th of May 2017 and completed on the 11th of December 2019. 
Conduct of the study 
The MAH states that the study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations were identified for 60% participants. The incidence was greater in the placebo 
group (65%) compared to the mepolizumab group (55%). The most frequently reported deviations 
were related to assessment or time point completion (39% of participants), and this category 
predominately consisted of spoilt samples for which the analysis of clinical chemistry, haematology 
and/or urinalysis could not be completed by the central laboratory (Listing 7). Other frequently 
reported categories of protocol deviations were visit completion (17% of participants), study 
procedures (14% of participants) and wrong study treatment/administration/dose (9% of participants). 
No other category of deviation was report for 5% or more of participants. 
Following unblinding, it was determined that 4 participants (<1%) had received a single dose of 
treatment which did not correspond to their randomised treatment. In the mepolizumab group, 2 
participants received a single dose of placebo (one at Week 32 and the other at Week 40). In the

Nasal Polyp Disease History and Characteristics 
The mean time since onset of NP at baseline was 11.41 years for the ITT population and similar 
between treatment groups.  Approximately half of participants had a diagnosis of NP for 10 or more 
years and approximately 30% of participants for 15 years or more. 
All participants had a history which included at least one surgery for NP in the past 10 years. The 
majority of participants had a history of 1 or 2 surgeries (70%). A greater proportion of participants 
had only 1 surgery in the mepolizumab group than the placebo group (52% and 40%, respectively). 
Approximately half of participants (48%) had received at least one course of OCS for NP in the 12 
months prior to screening.

Table 11: Summary of Nasal Polyp Disease History (Study 205687, ITT Population) 
Both Screening and Baseline mean total endoscopic score was similar between the two treatment 
groups. The centrally read Screening assessment was used to assess eligibility for randomisation in the 
study, and 4 participants had protocol deviations (i.e., their screening endoscopic score did not meet 
the minimum threshold of 5); all of these participants had a Screening endoscopic nasal polyp score of 
4 (3 participants [2%] in the placebo group and 1 participant [<1%] in the mepolizumab group).  
The mean endoscopic nasal polyp score improved in both treatment groups between Screening and 
Baseline, and at Baseline, a total of 75 participants (27%) had an endoscopic score <5 (40 participants 
[20%] in the placebo group and 35 participants in the mepolizumab group [17%]). 
Mean baseline nasal obstruction VAS score (8.97), mean baseline overall VAS score (9.07) and mean 
baseline SNOT-22 total score (64.1) were all similar between treatment groups.

Medical Conditions 
Overall, past medical conditions were reported for 17% of participants, the most common of which was 
pneumonia (9% of participants). Other frequently reported past medical conditions were cataract (3% 
of participants) and allergic rhinitis (2%). The incidence of past medical conditions was balanced 
between the treatment groups. 
Current medical conditions were reported for >99% of participants. 
Medical conditions classified as respiratory disorders were reported for >99% of participants, the most 
common of which were chronic sinusitis (99%), asthma (71%), allergic rhinitis (54%) and aspirin-
exacerbated respiratory disease (27%). Other current medical conditions reported for more than 10% 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021

of participants were hypertension (24%) and hypercholesterolemia (13%). The incidence of current 
medical conditions was balanced between the treatment groups. 
Asthma 
Overall, 71% of participants had a diagnosis of asthma at Screening. Few participants had experienced 
an asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to Screening (15% and 26% in the placebo and 
mepolizumab groups, respectively). 
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
98% of participants were receiving medication prior to the start of study treatment. The most common 
medications were in the respiratory system (98%) and dermatological (88%). In each ATC class, the 
proportion of participants receiving medication was similar between treatment groups. Eighty-seven 
percent (87%) of participants in the placebo group and 82% of participants in the mepolizumab group 
started a medication during the treatment period. 
The most common medications were for respiratory system (66% and 56% of participants in the 
placebo and mepolizumab groups, respectively). A greater proportion of participants in the placebo 
group than the mepolizumab group started a systemic corticosteroid for any reason during the 
treatment period (46% compared with 34%, respectively). 
Exposure and Treatment Compliance 
Mean exposure to study treatment was similar between the placebo and mepolizumab treatment 
groups (11.2 and 11.3 months, respectively). Median exposure was 12.0 months in both treatment 
groups. 
The mean number of treatments administered was similar between the placebo and mepolizumab 
treatment groups (12.0 and 12.2 injections, respectively).  
The mean duration of time spent in the no-treatment follow-up period for the 134 participants in the 
Follow-Up after Week 52 Population was similar between the placebo and mepolizumab treatment 
groups (5.42 and 5.37 months, respectively). 
Numbers analysed 
In the ITT population, 201 patients received placebo and 206 were treated with mepolizumab 100 mg 
SC. 
Outcomes and estimation 
All primary and secondary endpoints achieved statistical significance at the two-sided 5% level 
adjusted for multiplicity. 
Endoscopic Nasal Polyp Score at Week 52 (Co-Primary Endpoint) 
At the end of the 52-week treatment period, a greater proportion of participants in the mepolizumab 
group than the placebo group demonstrated a ≥1-point improvement in their total endoscopic NP score 
(50% compared with 28%, respectively. 
Correspondingly, fewer participants in the mepolizumab group than the placebo group had a worsening 
of their total endoscopic NP score over the same period (22% compared with 30%, respectively). 
For the co-primary endpoint of the change from baseline in total endoscopic NP score at Week 52, the 
median change in the mepolizumab group was -1.0 compared with 0 in the placebo group. There was a 
Assessment report

statistically significant improvement in this endpoint in favour of mepolizumab (p<0.001). Accounting 
for treatment group, geographic region, baseline score and log(e) baseline blood eosinophil count, the

Sensitivity and Supplementary Analyses of the Endoscopic Nasal Polyp Score Co-Primary 
Endpoint 
In the primary analysis, participants who had nasal surgery/sinuplasty were assigned their worst 
observed score prior to surgery/sinuplasty and participants with missing data (due to study withdrawal 
or otherwise) were assigned their worst observed score prior to study withdrawal or missing visit. Two 
sensitivity analyses were conducted using alternative imputation methods: 
• 
• 
participants who had nasal surgery/sinuplasty were assigned their worst observed score prior 
to surgery/sinuplasty and participants with missing data were assigned the worst possible 
score across all participants. 
participants who had nasal surgery/sinuplasty and/or missing data were assigned the worst 
possible score across all participants. 
In both sensitivity analyses, there was a statistically significant improvement in favour of mepolizumab 
(p<0.001) 
Figure 19: Figure of Change from Baseline Total Endoscopic Nasal Polyps Score (Centrally 
Read) at Week 52: Primary and Sensitivity Analyses (Study 205687, ITT Population) 
In a supplementary analysis of the co-primary endpoint using the PP Population, the median change 
from baseline in total endoscopic NP score at Week 52 in the mepolizumab group was -1.0 compared 
with 0 in the placebo group. There was a statistically significant improvement in this endpoint in favour 
of mepolizumab (p<0.001). 
Responder Analyses 
In the responder analysis of total endoscopic NP score, a responder was defined as a participant who 
had an improvement (decrease) of ≥ 1.0 point from baseline in the absence of surgery/sinuplasty at a 
given timepoint. 
The odds of being a responder in the mepolizumab group were consistently statistically significantly 
greater than the odds of being a responder in the placebo group from Week 20. At Week 52, the odds 
of being a responder in the mepolizumab group was 2.74 (95% CI 1.80, 4.18; p<0.001) times greater 
than the odds of being a responder in the placebo group.

Endoscopic Nasal Polyp Score (Investigator-Read) 
By Week 52, the total endoscopic NP scores were improved for participants in the mepolizumab group 
(median 5, mean 4.6, range 0-8), and to a lesser extent for participants in the placebo group (median 
6, mean 5.7, range 0-8). The change from baseline in total endoscopic NP scores showed a greater 
improvement in the mepolizumab group (median change: -1.0, mean: -1.6, SD: 2.07) than the 
placebo group (median change: 0.0, mean: -0.5, SD: 1.77).

In the 4-week period Week 49-52, at the end of the 52-week treatment period, a greater proportion of 
participants in the mepolizumab group than the placebo group demonstrated a >5-point improvement 
(decrease) in their nasal obstruction VAS score (44% compared with 23%, respectively). 
For the co-primary endpoint of the change from baseline in nasal obstruction VAS score during the 4 
weeks prior to Week 52, the median change in the mepolizumab group was -4.41 compared with -0.82 
in the placebo group. There was a statistically significant improvement in this endpoint in favour of 
mepolizumab (p<0.001). Accounting for treatment group, geographic region, baseline score and log(e) 
baseline blood eosinophil count, the adjusted treatment difference in medians was -3.14 (95% CI: -
4.09, -2.18).

Note: Participants with missing time period data were assigned their worst observed score prior to the missing time period. 
Nasal Symptoms and Facial Pain Composite VAS Score 
The nasal symptoms and facial pain composite VAS score was comprised of the individual VAS scores 
of nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat, loss of smell and facial pain. The nasal 
symptoms and facial pain composite VAS scores were similar in both treatment groups at baseline.  
Out of a maximum of 10, the median was 8.99 in the placebo group, with a mean of 8.77 (range: 
5.48-10.00; SD: 1.077), and 8.87 in the mepolizumab group, with a mean of 8.72 (range: 4.11-10.00; 
SD: 1.002). 
In the 4-week period Week 49-52, a greater proportion of participants in the mepolizumab group than 
the placebo group demonstrated a >5-point improvement (decrease) in their nasal symptoms and 
facial pain composite VAS score (38% compared with 21%, respectively). 
The median change in the mepolizumab group was -3.88 compared with -0.99 in the placebo group. 
There was a statistically significant improvement in this endpoint in favour of mepolizumab (p<0.001). 
Secondary endpoints 
Time to First Nasal Polyps Surgery (Key Secondary Endpoint) 
By Week 52, 18 participants (9%) in the mepolizumab group had undergone surgery compared with 
46 participants (23%) in the placebo group. Most participants had only 1 surgery, with 2 participants 
(<1%) in the mepolizumab group and 3 participants (1%) in the placebo group having 2 surgeries. 
The probability of undergoing surgery at any time prior to Week 52 was statistically significantly lower 
in the mepolizumab group than for participants in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 0.43, 95% CI: 
0.25, 0.76; p=0.003). The estimated risk of having surgery prior to Week 52 was 9.2% (95% CI: 
5.9%, 14.2%) for participants in the mepolizumab group compared to 23.6% (95% CI: 18.3%, 
30.3%) for participants in the placebo group (Kaplan-Meier estimates).

Note: Vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals. 
A tipping point sensitivity analysis shows that the results for time to first surgery are robust to the independent censoring assumption of the Cox 
proportional hazards model where participants who withdraw from the study before experiencing surgery have their event times censored at the time of 
study withdrawal.

Figure 25: Sensitivity Time to First Nasal Surgery: Tipping Point – Independent Censoring 
Assumption for Placebo (Study 205687, ITT Population) 
Note: The vertical reference line denotes expected number of surgeries under the assumption of independent censoring (IC) for mepolizumab, i.e. the risk 
of surgery for the imputed period is the same as the risk seen in the observed data. 
Note: The 2.3 post-withdrawal relative change in the risk of surgery for mepolizumab participants is equivalent to there being no treatment effect in the 
imputed period. 
Note: The tipping point occurs at a post-withdrawal relative change of approximately 22 in the risk of surgery for mepolizumab. 
Note: The risk of surgery for placebo is imputed under the assumption of independent censoring. 
A tipping point sensitivity analysis shows that the results for time to first surgery are robust to the 
independent censoring assumption of the Cox proportional hazards model where participants who 
withdraw from the study before experiencing surgery have their event times censored at the time of 
study withdrawal.  
A plausible assumption for mepolizumab withdrawals is the loss of any treatment benefit. This means a 
step-change in relative event rate equivalent to 1/(estimated treatment effect), i.e. 1/0.43 = 2.3-fold 
increase in event rate. Even under the best-case scenario for placebo withdrawals, such an increase in 
event rate among mepolizumab withdrawals would still produce a HR<0.50 and a statistically 
significant reduction. A plausible assumption for placebo withdrawals is independent censoring i.e. they 
continue to receive surgery at the same rate as participants who remain in the study (shown in the 
solid line on the y-axis). To tip the p-value ≥0.05, mepolizumab would need to experience an event 
rate over 20 times worse than that of participants in the same arm who stay longer and an event rate 
over 8 times worse than that of placebo participants. Such increases are biologically implausible. 
Time to First Nasal Surgery or Course of Systemic Steroids 
By Week 52, the risk of having surgery or systemic steroids was 29% lower for participants in the 
mepolizumab group than participants in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.00; 
p=0.050). 
Need for surgery  
The proportion of participants identified as having a need for surgery based on having an overall VAS 
symptom score of >7 (Weeks 49-52) and a total endoscopic score ≥5 (Week 52, centrally read), was 
lower in the mepolizumab group (57 participants, 28%) than the placebo group (98 participants, 
49%). The odds of no longer having a need for surgery up to Week 52 was statistically significantly 
Assessment report

higher for participants in the mepolizumab group than for participants in the placebo group (odds 
ratio: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.59, 3.79; p<0.001). 
SNOT-22 at Week 52 (Secondary Endpoint) 
At the end of the 52-week treatment period, a greater proportion of participants in the mepolizumab 
group than the placebo group demonstrated an improvement (decrease) at least 1 point in their SNOT-
22 score (77% compared with 60%, respectively). 
A ≥ 45-point improvement (decrease) was observed for 27% of participants in the mepolizumab group 
compared with 13% in the placebo group. 
For the secondary endpoint of the change from baseline in SNOT-22 total score at Week 52, the 
median change from baseline in the mepolizumab group was -30.0 compared with -14.0 in the placebo 
group.  
There was a statistically significant improvement in this endpoint in favour of mepolizumab (p<0.001). 
In the responder analysis of SNOT-22 total score, a responder was defined as a participant who had an 
improvement (decrease) of ≥8.9 points (the MCID) from baseline at a given timepoint. 
At Week 52, the odds of being a responder in the mepolizumab group was 2.44 (95% CI 1.60, 3.73; 
p<0.001) times greater than the odds of being a responder in the placebo group.

SNOT-22 Domain Scores at Week 52 
At Week 52, improvements (decreases) in the score for each domain were observed for participants in 
the mepolizumab group, which were in excess of improvements observed in the placebo group.

Systemic Steroid Use Proportion of Participants Requiring Systemic Steroids for Nasal 
Polyps (Secondary Endpoint) 
Over the 52-week treatment period, 25% of participants in the mepolizumab group required at least 
one course of systemic steroids for treatment of their NP, compared with 37% of participants in the

placebo group. The majority of participants who received systemic steroids only required 1 course (32 
of 52 participants [62%] in the mepolizumab group and 43 of 74 participants [58%] in the placebo 
group). 
For the secondary endpoint of the proportion of participants requiring systemic steroids for NP up to 
Week 52, the odds for participants in the mepolizumab group was statistically significantly lower than 
the odds for participants in the placebo group (odds ratio: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.92; p=0.020).

for Nasal Polyps up to Week 52 (Study 205687, ITT Population) 
Systemic Steroid Use for Nasal Polyps Across the 52-Week Treatment Period 
The number of days of use of systemic steroids for NP was similar between the two treatment groups.  
In the mepolizumab group, participants had a mean (SD) of 21.9 (45.81) days on systemic steroids, a 
mean (SD) of 6.22% (12.587) of days they were in the study up to Week 52.  
In the placebo group, participants had a mean (SD) of 19.0 (18.54) days on systemic steroids, a mean 
(SD) of 5.25% (5.049) of days they were in the study up to Week 52. 
The mean total prednisolone-equivalent use for NP was lower in the mepolizumab group (109.2 
mg/year, SD: 257.43) than the placebo group (181.2 mg/year, SD: 364.14). 
By Week 52, the probability of requiring an initial course of systemic steroid use for NP was lower in 
the mepolizumab group 25.4% (95% CI: 20.0, 32.1) than the placebo group 37.5% (95% CI: 31.1, 
44.6%). 
Over the 52-week treatment period, 25% of participants in the mepolizumab group required at least 
one course of systemic steroids for treatment of their NP, compared with 37% of participants in the 
placebo group. The majority of participants who received systemic steroids only required 1 course (32 
of 52 participants [62%] in the mepolizumab group and 43 of 74 participants [58%] in the placebo

Week 52, the odds for participants in the mepolizumab group was statistically significantly lower than 
the odds for participants in the placebo group (odds ratio: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.92; p=0.020).

University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) 
At Week 52, the median change from baseline in UPSIT was 0.0 in both treatment groups. The 
difference between treatment groups was not statistically significant (p=0.302). Accounting for 
treatment group, country, baseline score and log(e) baseline blood eosinophil count, the difference in 
adjusted medians between treatment groups was 0.40 (95% CI: -1.49, 2.28). 
Loss of Smell VAS Score at Week 49-52 (Secondary Endpoint) 
In the 4-week period Week 49-52, at the end of the 52-week treatment period, a greater proportion of 
participants in the mepolizumab group than the placebo group demonstrated a >5-point improvement 
(decrease) in their loss of smell VAS score (30% compared with 13%, respectively).  For the 
secondary endpoint of the change from baseline in mean individual VAS symptom score for loss of 
smell during the 4 weeks prior to Week 52, the median change in the mepolizumab group was -0.53 
compared with 0.00 in the placebo group. There was a statistically significant improvement in this 
endpoint in favour of mepolizumab (p<0.001).

At Week 52, the change from Baseline in PnIF was greater for the mepolizumab group (median: 30.0 
L/min, mean: 32.5 L/min, range -180 to 230, SD: 57.98), than for the placebo group (median: 0.0 
L/min, mean: 11.2 L/min, range -350 to 180, SD: 65.78). The improvement in the mepolizumab group 
was also in excess of the 20 L/min MCID for this assessment. 
Nasal Discharge 
Nasal discharge VAS scores were similar in both treatment groups at Baseline. Out of a maximum of 
10, the median was 9.04 in the placebo group, with a mean of 8.78 (range: 1.39-10.00; SD: 1.251), 
and 8.93 in the mepolizumab group, with a mean of 8.78 (range: 1.03-10.00; SD: 1.066). 
In the 4-week period Week 49-52, a greater proportion of participants in the mepolizumab group than 
the placebo group demonstrated a >5-point improvement (decrease) in their nasal discharge VAS 
score (47% compared with 23%, respectively). 
Follow-up Period after Week 52 
A total of 134 participants (33%) entered the no-treatment follow-up period after Week 52, 69 
participants (33%) in the mepolizumab group and 65 participants (32%) in the placebo group. 
At Week 76, 24 weeks after the end of the treatment period, the change from Baseline for total 
endoscopic nasal polyp score remained greater for participants in the mepolizumab group (median 
change: -1.0, mean change: -1.2, range: -6 to 3, SD: 1.80) than the placebo group (median change: -
0.0, mean change: -0.1, range: -4 to 4, SD: 1.59).

Individual VAS Symptom Scores 
VAS scores for each individual symptom were similar in both treatment groups at baseline for 
participants in the Follow-Up after Week 52 Population. The treatment effect observed for the 
mepolizumab group at the end of the treatment period (Weeks 49-52) was observed to slowly decline 
to the end of the no treatment follow-up period (Weeks 73-76), although values were still clearly 
differentiated from baseline values and there was no evidence of rebound. 
In the mepolizumab group the median change from baseline (min, max) at Weeks 49-52 was -5.76 (-
10.00, 0.55) compared with -4.39 (-10.00, 0.65) at Weeks 73-76. In the placebo group the median 
change from baseline (min, max) at Weeks 49-52 was -1.56 (-8.97, 1.19) compared with -0.83 (-9.03, 
1.39) at Weeks 73-76 
Nasal Polyp Surgery 
For the Follow-Up after Week 52 Population, the probability of having surgery prior to the end of 
treatment period (Week 52) was substantially lower for participants in the mepolizumab group than in 
the placebo group (4.3% and 24.6%, respectively). Participants in the mepolizumab group continued 
to have a substantially lower probability of surgery (8.7%) compared with the placebo group (30.8%) 
at the end of the no treatment follow-up period (Week 76). 
SF-36 Health Survey 
At Baseline, norm-based median scores for the SF-36 Health Survey ranged from lower values in 
General Health (40.35 for both the mepolizumab and placebo groups) to higher values for Social 
Functioning (75.00 for both the mepolizumab and placebo groups). 
At the end of the treatment period (Week 52), the median change from baseline was 0.00 in all 8 SF-
36 domains for the placebo group. The mepolizumab group had median improvements from baseline in 
the 6 domains of Physical Functioning (3.83), Role Physical (6.73), Body Pain (4.44), General Health 
(4.76), Vitality (5.94) and Mental Health (2.62). No improvement was observed in the 2 domains of 
Social Functioning (0.00) and Role Emotional (0.00). 
The median change from baseline at Week 52 for the Mental and Physical Component Summary scores 
0.00 for the placebo group. For the mepolizumab group, there was a larger median change from 
baseline in the Physical Component Summary score (6.75) than the Mental Component Summary 
Score (1.20). 
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI-GH v2). 
Mean WPAI scores were similar at baseline (Randomisation) for each question in both the mepolizumab 
and placebo treatment groups: work time missed due to health (4.9% and 5.0%, respectively), 
impairment while working due to health (48.1% and 50.1%, respectively), overall work impairment 
due to health (49.5% and 50.8%) and activity impairment due to health (53.4% and 53.2%, 
respectively). 
At Week 52, improvements were observed in both the mepolizumab and placebo groups, with lower 
impairment apparent in the mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group: impairment while 
working due to health (18.5% and 22.9%, respectively), overall work impairment due to health 
(20.6% and 27.0%) and activity impairment due to health (19.2% and 27.1%, respectively). Little 
improvement was observed in either the mepolizumab.

Additional post HOC analyses 
Co-Primary Endpoints 
Post-hoc supplementary analyses were carried out using a regression-based parametric mixed model 
repeated measures (MMRM) approach for the co-primary endpoints of: 
•  Change from baseline in total endoscopic nasal polyp (ENP) score at Week 52 (based on 
centrally read data) 
•  Change from baseline in mean nasal obstruction visual analogue (VAS) score during the 4 
weeks prior to Week 52. 
For these analyses, the summary measure of treatment effect was the difference between 
mepolizumab and placebo in variable means for the intent to treat (ITT) population. 
Nasal surgery represents an intercurrent event as any nasal surgical procedure can affect subsequent 
scores for the co-primary endpoints. 
Missing data from participants who prematurely withdrew from the study was imputed using multiple 
imputation. Two strategies were for the imputation of missing data: 
a)  missing at random (MAR) imputation implemented which assumes that future outcomes for 
those who withdraw can be predicted from a combination of participant characteristics, the 
participant’s past observations and the patterns of response of participants who remain in the 
trial (i.e. conditional on the data observed for each participant, their unavailable data are 
randomly missing). 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 72/129 
 
 
 
 
b)  off-treatment imputation which assumes that future outcomes for those who withdraw can be 
predicted from a combination of participant characteristics, the participant’s past observations 
and the patterns of response of participants who withdrew from the investigational product but 
continued in the trial. 
Stepwise imputation methods were implemented where imputations for a visit are conditioned on data 
from previous visits. For both models missing values were imputed sequentially at post-baseline visits 
1,…,T. At a given visit t the imputation regression model included both observed and imputed outcome 
values from previous visits 1,…,t-1, baseline score, region, log(e) baseline blood eosinophil count and 
treatment at visit t. 
Both observed and imputed outcome values from previous visits were used in the regression models. 
For the MAR model the treatment covariate at visit t was equal to the participants randomised 
treatment regardless of the on or off-treatment status. For participants who had already discontinued 
from the study at visit t, missing values were imputed based on the regression model and assuming 
those observations are per randomised treatment. 
For the off-treatment model, the treatment covariate at visit t was equal to the randomised treatment 
if the participant was still on-treatment or a generic ‘off-treatment’ if the participant had already 
discontinued treatment. For participants who had already discontinued from the study at visit t, 
missing values were imputed based on the regression model and assuming those observations are off-
treatment. 
For each co-primary endpoint, analysis of the completed datasets was carried out using a mixed model 
repeated measures analysis with covariates of treatment group, geographic region, baseline value, 
log(e) baseline blood eosinophil count and time point, plus interaction terms for time point by baseline 
value and time point by treatment group. The results were combined across 2000 imputations using 
Rubin’s rules. 
Nasal Polyp Surgery 
A post-hoc analysis of the proportion of participants in the ITT population requiring nasal surgery was 
carried out. The summary measure of treatment effect was the odds ratio representing the relative 
odds of a participant undergoing nasal surgery up to Week 52 in the mepolizumab arm compared with 
placebo. A treatment policy strategy was used for the intercurrent event of premature discontinuation 
of interventional product. All nasal surgeries were included in the analysis regardless of whether the 
surgery occurred before or after discontinuation of interventional product. The analysis was conducted 
using a logistic regression model with covariates of treatment group, geographic region, baseline total 
endoscopic score (centrally read), baseline nasal obstruction VAS, log(e) baseline blood eosinophil 
count and number of previous surgeries (1, 2, >2 as ordinal). 
Health-Quality of Life: SNOT-22 Total and Domain Scores 
Post-hoc supplementary analyses of the Sino-nasal Outcome Test - 22 items (SNOT-22) total score 
and individual domain scores were conducted, the summary measure of treatment effect being the 
difference between mepolizumab and placebo in variable means for the ITT population (the summary 
measure for the primary analysis of SNOT-22 was the difference in medians). For this post-hoc 
analysis, handling of intercurrent events was the same as for the primary analysis. 
Analysis was carried out using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of treatment group, 
geographic region, baseline, log(e) baseline blood eosinophil count and visit, plus interaction terms for 
visit by baseline and visit by treatment group.

Summary of the results of the post hoc analysis 
•  Endoscopic Nasal Polyp Score and Symptoms of Nasal Obstruction (Co-Primary 
Endpoints) 
Total ENP Score (Centrally Read) 
The total ENP score was the sum of the right and left nostril scores, with a range of 0 (no polyps in 
either nostril) to 8 (large polyps causing almost complete congestion/ obstruction of the inferior 
meatus in both nostrils). Total ENP scores were similar in both treatment groups at Baseline, with a 
mean (SD) score of 5.4 (1.17) in the mepolizumab group and 5.6 (1.41) in the placebo group.

By Week 52, 18 participants (9%) in the mepolizumab group and 46 participants (23%) in the placebo 
group had undergone nasal surgery. In a post-hoc analysis of the proportion of participants requiring 
nasal surgery, the odds of surgery were statistically significantly lower for participants in the 
mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group (odds ratio: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.72;

Table 26: Analysis of Mean Change from Baseline in SNOT-22 Domain Scores at Week 52 
(MMRM Analysis) (Study 205687, ITT Population) 
The treatment effect estimates from the post-hoc analyses for the total nasal polyps score are aligned 
with the results from the primary analysis and from the pre-specified sensitivity analysis. 
For the nasal obstruction VAS, the treatment effect estimates from the post-hoc MMRM analyses are 
smaller than the adjusted treatment difference in medians from the primary and pre-specified 
sensitivity analyses. The MMRM LS mean improvement in the placebo arm of -2.5 is larger than the 
median of -0.82 (205687 CSR Table, reflecting the skewed nature of the distribution of nasal 
obstruction VAS scores.

Supportive study - 
Study MPP111782  
This phase 2 study was originally designed as a two-part (Part A and Part B) randomised, double-blind, 
placebo controlled, multi-center study to investigate the use of 750 mg mepolizumab in reducing the 
need for surgery in subjects with severe bilateral nasal polyposis. Part A of the study consisted of 
Screening, Run-in and Treatment Periods. 
Part B of the study was the follow-up phase and was intended to give an indication of potential trends 
in post-treatment nasal polyposis dynamics with a focus on time to recurrence and/or surgery; no 
formal hypothesis was to be tested. 
Subjects who were successfully enrolled in the study were randomized into one of two treatment 
groups, receiving a total of six doses (one every four weeks): 
•  Group 1: 750 mg of mepolizumab by intravenous (IV) infusion 
•  Group 2: Placebo by IV infusion 
The total duration of the study for each subject enrolled was up to 11 months if completing Part A only 
or 13 months if eligible for Part B. 
Number of Subjects: 
It was planned to enrol up to 110 subjects in this study. A total of 109 were enrolled of whom 105 
subjects were included in the Safety and Intent-to-Treat (ITT) populations. 
An un-blinded sample size re-estimation was performed after 46 subjects completed the study.

Outcomes /Endpoints 
The primary endpoint for this study was the number of subjects with reduced need for surgery at the 
end of Part A of the study 
Secondary endpoints for this study included endoscopic nasal polyp score dynamics for 750 mg dose 
levels and placebo subjects; the number of subjects requiring polyp surgery per treatment group; 
FEV1, FVC, and PEFR parameters. Clinical PD was also assessed as a secondary endpoint including 
symptoms, PnIF, olfaction testing and VAS questionnaires. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to the 750 mg mepolizumab or placebo treatment groups in accordance with 
the randomization schedule generated by Clinical Statistics prior to the start of the study using 
validated internal software. A centre-based randomization schedule was used for this study. 
Blinding 
This was a double-blind study. A site third-party un-blinded pharmacist was required for investigational 
product (IP) dispensing. 
Treatment codes could be unblinded by an investigator or treating physician only in case of medical 
emergency or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of the investigational 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 80/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
product was essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject. The investigator was to 
make every effort to contact the medical monitor or appropriate study personnel to discuss options 
before unblinding the subject’s treatment assignment. 
If the blind was broken for any reason and the investigator was unable to contact the Sponsor prior to 
un-blinding, the investigator was to notify the sponsor as soon as possible after the unblinding incident 
but without revealing the subject’s study treatment assignment, unless the information was important 
to the safety of subjects remaining in the study. The date and reason for the unblinding of treatment 
assignment of that subject was fully documented by the investigator in the appropriate data collection 
tool. 
Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff could unblind the treatment codes for 
individual subject in the event of serious adverse event (SAE). If an expedited regulatory report was to 
be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the regulatory report identifying the subject’s 
treatment assignment was sent to investigators in accordance with relevant regulations and/or the 
MAH policy. 
Individuals in World-Wide Bioanalysis, Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (DMPK), directly 
involved in the bioanalysis of PK samples for mepolizumab were unblinded. Operating procedures were 
in place which were strictly followed to ensure that all other personnel involved in the study remained 
blinded. 
The intention for this study was for the treatment blind to remain intact until Inform Database Lock 
(also known as Source Data Lock and formally Database Freeze), at which point the blind would be 
officially broken. It was intended that Data management and site staff would remain blinded during the 
conduct of the study and during the data cleaning, although treatment was dispensed at the site using 
an unblinded pharmacist. During the final cleaning effort prior to database release the Data Quality 
Lead (DQL) discovered two incidences of unblinding to actual treatment. Both subjects were withdrawn 
from the study at the time of unblinding due to misdosing. There was no compromise to subject safety 
as a result of this unblinding and these subjects’ data were fully excluded from the Per Protocol (PP) 
statistical analysis.  
Since the PK concentration data would have unblinded the study team, partial Database Lock was 
declared on all the study data except for PK. Only after partial database lock were data unblinded and 
the PK concentration dataset processed to allow the derivation of the PK parameters. 
Sample size 
The sample size was determined using a technique called ‘predictive’ power whereby interim data were 
planned to be collected after 40 subjects (in total) completed the study (approximately 20 subjects per 
treatment group). In total, 42 subjects had completed the study and a further 4 subjects were 
considered withdrawals and their data were included in the interim analyses. Based on these interim 
data, the predictive power was determined. A 1-sided alpha level of 0.05 was used when determining 
the predictive power. Following a review of operational characteristics assessing the impact of decision 
rules for the sample size determination it was deemed necessary for a prior distribution to be included 
in the derivation of predictive power when determining sample size re-estimation. A Beta (20, 80) prior 
was be used for placebo and a Beta (50, 50) was used for the mepolizumab dose. 
Sample Size Re-estimation 
Given that stopping rules (both for efficacy and for futility) were applied, the sample size re-estimation 
was only to be carried out if the efficacy and futility rules were not met. The sample size could be re-
estimated using the interim data and Bayesian priors mentioned above so that the final sample size 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 81/129 
 
 
 
 
 
gave a ‘predicted’ power of at least 90%. For logistical purposes, the maximum sample size was 
however set to approximately 55 per group, even if the predictive power suggested more subjects 
were required to achieve 90% power. 
Analysis populations 
All subjects’ population included all subjects who were enrolled into the study and included run-in 
failures. 
Safety population comprised of all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment. This 
population was based on the treatment the subject actually received. In cases where there was a 
discrepancy between randomised and actual treatment, the analysis used the actual treatment 
received by the subject (for more than 50% of their treatment administrations) rather than the 
randomised treatment. If a subject received an equal number of both treatments then they were 
assigned to the treatment to which they were randomised. 
Intent-To-Treat population (Treated or Exposed) comprised all randomised subjects who received at 
least one dose of study treatment. This population was based on the treatment to which the subject 
was randomised. Any subject who received a treatment randomization number was to be considered to 
have been randomized. 
Per-Protocol population (Treated or Exposed) comprised all randomized subjects who received at least 
one dose of study treatment and who complied with the protocol. 
Pharmacokinetic population included subjects in the ‘Safety’ population for whom at least one 
pharmacokinetic sample was obtained and analysed. 
Statistical Methods 
The main aim of this study was to test for superiority of mepolizumab against placebo. The null 
hypothesis for the treatment comparison was that there is no difference between mepolizumab and 
placebo in the proportion of subjects who do not require surgery following 6 months of treatment. The 
alternative hypothesis was that the proportion of subjects with a reduction in the need for surgery at 
Week 25 is greater in mepolizumab then placebo. 
An adaptive design incorporating an interim analysis was used with two separate alpha levels. At the 
interim the mepolizumab dose was deemed to have shown to reject H0 if the p-value was less than or 
equal to 0.025 (1-sided); i.e., alpha was set to a 1-sided 0.025 level at the interim. The interim 
showed that the efficacy results met the criteria specified in the protocol to continue recruiting 
subjects. There was no qualitative difference in the conclusion contingent upon the missing data 
methods (last observation carried forward [LOCF] or set to non-responder). The predictive power 
calculation suggested a revised sample size of 50 per arm in total. 
A one-sided test with α=0.05 could be used to test the above hypothesis at the final look. Different 
alpha levels were chosen at interim and final lock so that the study would only be stopped early for 
efficacy if there was overwhelming evidence of effect. No formal alpha adjustments were made as a 
consequence of the interim look. The resultant study-wise overall estimated significance level for the 
adaptive design was estimated as 0.0527. This was based on an assumption that the placebo 
proportion of subjects requiring surgery was 20%. Slight changes were seen in the overall estimated 
significance as the assumed placebo rate changed. 
Efficacy data were analysed using three methods: 
o  The “per protocol” missing method, which set any missing responses or steroid excluded 
responses to non-responder status. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 82/129 
 
 
 
 
o  The LOCF method, where the last non-missing or non-steroid-excluded responder status was 
carried forward to the final Part A visit. 
o  The multiple imputation method, which imputed missing data (and any steroid excluded data) 
in a chronological order from the first missing visit up to and including the final Part A visit 
(separate imputation models were used for each treatment arm [via by-group processing]). 
Results 
Participant flow  
A total of 105 subjects were randomized, received at least one dose of study drug, and were included 
in the ITT Population. 
Prior to Protocol Amendment 5, subjects were considered to have completed the study if they 
completed Part A and Part B; they were considered a non-completer if they completed Part A but did 
not meet the continuation criteria for Part B. For this reason, completion rates appear artificially low. 
Most subjects did not go into part B and therefore were reported as “withdrawn” at the end of Part A, 
even though they did complete Part A. 
After Protocol Amendment 5, a subject was considered to have completed the study if they completed 
Part A; the requirement for subjects to enter Part B of the study was removed. 
Table 28: Subject Disposition (Study MPP111782, ITT Population) 
Fourteen subjects in the mepolizumab treatment group and 7 subjects in the placebo treatment group 
chose to continue to Part B. Of these, 4 subjects in the placebo group and 4 subjects in the 
mepolizumab continued into Part B despite not meeting the continuation requirements

Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups. The study population 
was primarily White (97%) and over half were male (71%). 
The majority of subjects had a history of asthma (44 [81%] subjects in the mepolizumab treatment 
group and 38 [75%] subjects in the placebo treatment group). All subjects with a history of asthma 
had mild or moderate disease and most had not had an exacerbation in the last year (93% in the 
mepolizumab treatment group and 92% in the placebo group). 
The mean duration of asthma for the asthmatic subjects was 160.4 months in the placebo group and 
180.3 months in the mepolizumab group. 
Table 29: Demographics (Study MPP111782, ITT Population)  
Concomitant medication 
Prior medications were not collected for this study. Concomitant medications were used during the 
Run-in Period by all subjects. The most frequently used concomitant medications during Run-in (≥10% 
overall) were: fluticasone (104 subjects [>99%]), salmeterol (37 subjects [35%]), budesonide 28 
subjects [(27%]), formoterol (27 subjects [26%]), salbutamol (22 subjects [21%]), montelukast (11 
subjects [10%]) and paracetamol (10 subjects [10%]). 
During the Treatment Period, concomitant medications were used by all subjects in the mepolizumab 
treatment group and 98% of subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently used concomitant 
medications during treatment (≥10% in either treatment group) were: fluticasone (54 subjects 
[100%] and 49 subjects [96%] in the mepolizumab and placebo treatment groups, respectively), 
paracetamol (17 subjects [31%] and 22 subjects [43%], respectively), ibuprofen (4 subjects [7%] and 
9 subjects [18%], respectively) and diclofenac (7 subjects [13%] and 0%, respectively). 
Numbers analysed 
Of the subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment, 54 subjects were randomized to the 
mepolizumab treatment group and 51 subjects were randomized to the placebo treatment group. 
However, 1 subject who was randomized to mepolizumab received placebo in error. Hence, the Safety 
Population comprised 53 subjects in the mepolizumab group and 52 subjects in the placebo group.

Table 30: Summary of Analysis Populations (Study MPP111782) 
Outcomes and estimation 
At Week 25, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the mepolizumab group compared with the 
placebo group no longer required surgery (33% versus 10%; p=0.003 for the Per Protocol (PP) 
Population where missing data were set to non-responder). A supportive analysis using the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) method also confirmed these results (35% versus 16% for the 
mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively; p=0.016). Analyses of the data using the ITT 
Population (when missing data were either set to non-responder or using LOCF) supported the main 
analyses. Nucala vs placebo showed responses 30% versus 10% resp; p=0.006. The additional 
analysis using the LOCF method also confirmed these results (35% versus 16% for the mepolizumab 
and placebo groups, respectively; p=0.012). 
The increase (compared with placebo) in the number of subjects receiving mepolizumab who did not 
require polyp surgery by Week 25 could be observed from Week 9 onwards. 
The difference between the treatment groups then increased steadily until the end of Part A when 33% 
of subjects in the mepolizumab group were considered responders compared with 10% in the placebo 
group. 
Table 31: Summary and Analysis of the Reduction of Subjects Who Require Polyp Surgery by 
Week 25 (Study MPP111782, PP Population) 
More limited data were available for Part B of the study as only 7 subjects in the placebo group and 14 
subjects in the mepolizumab group entered this part of the study. By Week 45 of the study, 36% of 
subjects in the mepolizumab group were considered to be responders compared with 29% of the 
placebo group. 
Endoscopic nasal polyp score of the worst affected nostril was included in the composite primary 
endpoint and was a secondary endpoint of this study. The probability of having a lower endoscopic 
nasal polyp score of the worst affected nostril at Week 25 was higher in the mepolizumab group than 
in the placebo group for the PP Population (odds ratio: 5.22; 95% CI: 0.99, 27.44; p=0.051). Note 
that the p-value represents the odds of a lower endoscopic nasal polyp score of the worst affected 
nostril in the mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group. Similar results were observed in 
the ITT Population at Week 25 (odds ratio: 6.62; 95% CI: 1.27, 34.49; p=0.025). 
The assessment of nasal polyposis using VAS was also part of the composite primary endpoint of the 
study as well as a secondary endpoint. The nasal polyposis VAS represented as the treatment

difference (mepolizumab - placebo) at Week 25 was -1.81 (CI: -2.90, -0.71; p=0.001). These results 
were supported by the ITT Population at Week 25 (treatment difference: -1.84; 95% CI: -2.92, -0.76; 
p=0.001). 
Based on the post-hoc definition of responders (subjects who improved from baseline by at least 1 
point in total [sum of left and right nostril scores] endoscopic nasal polyp score by Week 25 of the 
study), in the PP Population at Week 25, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the 
mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group had an improvement of at least 1 point over 
baseline in the total endoscopic nasal polyp score (57% versus 27%; p=0.001). The supportive 
analysis using the LOCF method also confirmed these results (61% versus 33% for the mepolizumab 
and placebo groups, respectively; p=0.003). Data from the ITT Population were supportive of the PP 
Population findings. 
Secondary endpoints: 
Endoscopic Nasal Polyp Score 
Endoscopic nasal polyp score of the worst affected nostril was included in the composite primary 
endpoint of this study and was a secondary endpoint of this study.  
The probability of having a lower endoscopic nasal polyp score of the worst affected nostril at Week 25 
was higher in the mepolizumab group than in the placebo group (odds ratio: 5.22; 95% CI: 0.99, 
27.44; p=0.051). Note that the p-value represents the odds of a lower endoscopic nasal polyp score of 
the worst  
affected nostril in the mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group. Similar results were 
observed in the ITT Population at Week 25 (odds ratio: 6.62; 95% CI: 1.27, 34.49; p=0.025). 
Table 32: Endoscopic Nasal Polyp Score of the Worst Affected Nostril at Week 25 (Study 
MPP111782, PP Population 
In both treatment groups, there was a tendency for the distribution of endoscopic nasal polyp scores of 
the worst affected nostril to shift over time towards lower scores, although this was more marked in 
the mepolizumab group than in the placebo group. 
Nasal Polyposis VAS 
Severity of condition was assessed by asking subjects to indicate on a VAS (0 – 10 cm) the severity of 
their nasal polyposis in the mepolizumab and placebo groups at Week 25. The treatment difference 
(mepolizumab – placebo) at Week 25 was -1.81 (CI: -2.90, -0.71; p=0.001). Similar results were 
observed in the ITT Population at Week 25 (treatment difference: -1.84; 95% CI: -2.92, -0.76; 
p=0.001). 
In Part A, the difference between treatments in the assessment of severity of nasal polyps was apparent 
from Week 9 and persisted through Week 25. In general, the response seemed to persist through Part

B of the study but there were limited subjects included in Part B. Therefore, caution should be taken 
when interpreting this data due to the limited number of subjects. Similar results were observed for the 
ITT Population. 
Table 33: Assessment of Nasal Polyposis by Visit – VAS (cm) at Week 25 (Study 
MPP111782, PP Population 
Post-Hoc Analyses of Responders Based on Total Endoscopic Nasal Polyp Score Improvement 
The increase (compared with placebo) in the number of subjects receiving mepolizumab who improved 
from baseline by at least 1 point by Week 25 was observed from Week 9 onwards (27 subjects [55%] 
and 15 subjects [29%] responders in the mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively [p=0.005). 
This improvement was maintained until the end of Part A with very little change in either treatment 
group during the intervening visits. Although the number of responders and the magnitude of response 
was greater with the new definition of responders it was observed for both the mepolizumab and 
placebo groups. There was therefore no overall change in the magnitude of difference between 
treatments. Overall, these results support the primary analysis. 
Results from the PP Population where missing data were imputed using the LOCF method supported 
these findings. 
This difference between the mepolizumab and placebo groups in the number of subjects who improved 
from baseline by at least 1 point in total endoscopic nasal polyp score was maintained in Part B of the 
study. In the mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively, 10 subjects [71%] and 3 subjects [43%] 
were responders at Week 29, and 8 subjects [57%] and 3 subjects [43%] were responders at Week 45 
(PP Population, missing data set to non-responders. 
At Week 25, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the mepolizumab group compared with the 
placebo group had an improvement of at least 1 point over baseline in the total endoscopic nasal polyp 
score (57% versus 27%; p=0.001). 
A post-hoc summary of subject response based on the total endoscopic nasal polyp score improvement 
from baseline at Week 25 were performed on the PP Population. 
Subgroup Summary for Subjects with Asthma 
A post-hoc summary of subject response based on the total endoscopic nasal polyp score improvement 
from baseline at Week 25 for subjects with asthma was performed on the PP Population. As in the 
main analysis, a greater proportion of subjects in the mepolizumab group compared with the placebo 
group were considered responders at Week 25 (60% versus 22%). The additional analysis using the 
LOCF method also confirmed these results (65% versus 30% for the mepolizumab and placebo groups, 
respectively). 
Subgroup Summary for Subjects with Rhinitis 
A greater proportion of subjects in the mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group were 
considered responders at Week 25 (53% versus 26%). The additional analysis using the LOCF method 
also confirmed these results (55% versus 33% for the mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively).

Subgroup Summary for Subjects with Rhinosinusitis 
A greater proportion of subjects in the mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group were 
considered responders at Week 25 (54% versus 27%). The additional analysis using the LOCF method

Subgroup Summary for Subjects with Aspirin Sensitivity 
A greater proportion of subjects in the mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group were 
considered responders at Week 25 (53% versus 16%). The additional analysis using the LOCF method 
also confirmed these results (58% versus 24% for the mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively). 
Subgroup Summary for Subjects with Baseline Blood Eosinophil 
Concentrations of >0.3 cells x 109/L A greater proportion of subjects in the mepolizumab group 
compared with the placebo group were considered responders at Week 25 (58% versus 22%). 
The additional analysis using the LOCF method also confirmed these results (63% versus 24% for the 
mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively). 
Individual Symptoms Visual Analogue Scales 
Individual symptoms VAS scores were a secondary efficacy endpoint of this study. 
Subjects were asked to indicate on a VAS (0 – 10 cm) the severity of 4 nasal polyposis symptoms (1 
VAS for each symptom): rhinorrhea, mucus in the throat, nasal blockage and loss of smell.  
Assessment of rhinorrhea at Week 25 for the PP Population: The treatment difference (mepolizumab – 
placebo) at Week 25 was -2.33 (CI: -3.44, -1.22; p<0.001).  
Assessment of mucus in the throat at Week 25 for the PP Population:  The treatment difference 
(mepolizumab – placebo) at Week 25 was -2.11 (CI:-3.22, -1.01; p<0.001). 
Assessment of nasal blockage at Week 25 for the PP Population: The treatment difference 
(mepolizumab – placebo) at Week 25 was -1.76 (CI: -2.87, -0.65; p=0.002). 
Assessment of loss of smell at Week 25 for the PP Population: The treatment difference (mepolizumab 
– placebo) at Week 25 was -1.81 (CI: -2.84, -0.78; p=0.001). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH initially submitted a variation application for the following indication:  
Nucala is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of adult 
patients with inadequately controlled severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 
Scientific advice was given by CHMP on May 17th 2016 (Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/156/4/2016/III). 
The MAH previously planned two replicate phase 3 studies with the primary endpoint at week 24. This 
was amended to a single pivotal trial and the timing of the co-primary endpoints amended from week 
24 to week 52, following discussion with FDA. For the additional aspects the advice was followed by 
the MAH. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Three studies were submitted by the MAH. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 88/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The first study  (CRT110178) was an investigator led randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
single centre study to investigate the use of mepolizumab 750 mg IV versus placebo study in adult 
patients with severe CRSwNP (grade 3-4) or NP that were recurrent after surgery or refractory to 
corticosteroid therapy. Based on the results of this study the MAH initiated the Phase II study 
MPP111782. 
Mepolizumab 750 mg IV demonstrated expected PK in adults with severe bilateral NP, supporting the 
view that disease is not a covariate of mepolizumab exposure. 
No subjects treated with mepolizumab developed anti-drug antibodies, which is consistent with the low 
immunogenic potential of mepolizumab observed in other indications. 
The second (Phase II study MPP111782) was a supportive phase 2b randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled parallel groups study. Consisting of part A which was 24 weeks duration. Patients 
received mepolizumab 750 mg iv or placebo Q4W. Part B was for 20 weeks patients received standard 
of care for NP.  110 patients enrolled and 109 were randomised.  
No formal dose-response study was performed in patients with nasal polyps. The dose regimens were 
selected based on the totality of clinical evidence in the Nucala program including data from Phase 2 
study MPP111782 in patients with nasal polyps and symptoms of chronic sinusitis. 
The PK data demonstrated that Mepolizumab 100 mg SC in adult patients with CRSwNP resulted in a 
marked reduction in blood eosinophils early in treatment, which was sustained throughout the study. 
The magnitude of blood eosinophil count reduction was consistent with subjects with other eosinophilic 
conditions. 
A recent meta-analysis population PK/PD model was applied directly to the PK/PD data collected from 
adults with CRSwNP in study 205687, without adjustment except for a fixed effect disease parameter 
for baseline blood eosinophil count to better capture the baseline in subjects with nasal polyposis. 
The GOF plots indicated that, in contrast to PK, the PKPD model did not fit the CRSwNS data 
particularly well, which was confirmed by the GOF statistical tests. This suggests that the PD response 
to mepolizumab in subjects with CRSwNP may not be similar to other eosinophilic conditions. It 
appears to be a tendency for over-prediction of eosinophil counts. Based on the exposure-response 
analysis, at the single dose of 100 mg SC Q4W investigated in the study 205687, there was no 
evidence of increased efficacy with increased mepolizumab exposure (individual weight-based dose or 
average plasma concentration). Therefore, the 100mg regimen is acceptable. 
There are no proposed dose adjustments in special populations (i.e., elderly, renal- and hepatic-
impaired subjects) are not warranted for adult patients with nasal polyposis. 
Phase 3 SYNAPSE (StudY in NAsal Polyps patients to assess the Safety and Efficacy of mepolizumab) – 
study 205687 
A single pivotal phase 3 study was conducted. This was a randomised, double-blind, parallel group 
PhIII study to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of 100 mg SC Mepolizumab as an add-on to 
maintenance treatment in adults with severe bilateral nasal polyps - SYNAPSE (StudY in NAsal Polyps 
patients to assess the Safety and Efficacy of mepolizumab). 
The study comprised of a 4-week run-in period, followed by a 52-week treatment period. Participants 
received a total of thirteen, 4-weekly doses of mepolizumab 100 mg or placebo, delivered by SC 
injection using a pre-filled safety syringe. The final dose of study treatment was administered at Week 
48. Patients were followed up to week 76. 
All participants were on SoC for CRSwNP throughout the study (run-in, treatment and no-treatment 
follow-up periods), which consisted of daily mometasone furoate nasal spray (MF), and if required, 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 89/129 
 
 
 
 
saline nasal douching, occasional short courses of high dose OCS and/or antibiotics. At the start of run-
in and throughout the study, participants were placed on MF at the maximum prescribed dose (if not 
already) according to local label.  
The patient population consisted of patients 18 years and older with body weight > 40 kgs. 
Participants who have had at least one previous surgery in the previous 10 years for the removal of 
NP, high CRSwNP disease burden (based on polyps score) and symptoms of NC. Patients were to have 
at least 2 symptoms of nasal blockage/congestion, nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure, reduction or 
loss of smell or rhinorrhea for at least 12 weeks prior to randomization (8 weeks prior to screening) 
despite therapy with intranasal corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids in the past 2 years or sino-
nasal surgery.  
The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar between treatment groups in the 
randomized population. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) history was comparable 
among the treatment groups as well as the disease baseline characteristics. 
Some protocol amendments and changes in the planned analyses were made in both studies. These 
changes were unlikely to have a significant impact on the study results. 
There were 2 co-primary endpoints: 
•  Change from Baseline in total ENP score at Week 52 (based on centrally read data) 
•  Change from Baseline in mean nasal obstruction VAS score during the 4 weeks prior to Week 
52. 
This approach is acceptable as change in nasal polyp size on its own is not considered sufficient as the 
primary endpoint as the interpretation of the clinical relevance of a reduction is difficult as no MCID 
has been established and therefore, adding an endpoint evaluating the impact of symptoms is of key 
importance in measuring outcomes in nasal polyposis. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
• 
Phase 2 study 
The phase 2 study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the need for surgery at Week 
25. 33% versus 10%; p=0.003 for the Per Protocol (PP) Population where missing data were set to 
non-responder).  The secondary endpoints also demonstrated efficacy for mepolizumab treatment. 
The probability of having a lower endoscopic nasal polyp score of the worst affected nostril at Week 25 
was higher in the mepolizumab group than in the placebo group for the PP Population (odds ratio: 
5.22; 95% CI: 0.99, 27.44; p=0.051.  
The assessment of nasal polyposis using VAS was also part of the composite primary endpoint of the 
study as well as a secondary endpoint. The nasal polyposis VAS represented as the treatment 
difference (mepolizumab - placebo) at Week 25 was -1.81 (CI: -2.90, -0.71; p=0.001). These results 
were supported by the ITT Population at Week 25 (treatment difference: -1.84; 95% CI: -2.92, -0.76; 
p=0.001). However, there was a very high withdrawal rate in this study only 39% completed the 
study, however it is viewed as supportive evidence. 
The immunogenicity results support the low immunogenic potential of mepolizumab. 
Dose Justification 
An SC mepolizumab dose regimen of 100 mg every 28 days was selected in place of 750 mg IV (used 
in the MPP111782 Phase II study) for this Phase III confirmatory study for several reasons. First, the 
exposure-response for mepolizumab is independent of administration route. Secondly, the lower (SC) 
dose provides substantial pharmacological overlap with the higher (IV) dose, with at least a 75% 
inhibition of blood eosinophils compared to placebo. Thirdly, in study MPP111782, participants 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021

continued to experience benefit from mepolizumab treatment during drug wash-out when their higher 
dose of 750mg IV had declined to exposures commensurate with a lower dose of 100 mg SC. Finally, 
during the Phase III severe asthma confirmatory study, MEA115588, participants with concomitant NP 
experienced clinical benefit for symptoms of NP, in addition to reductions in clinical exacerbations of 
their severe asthma. 
Treatments 
• 
Phase 3 study 
Of the 407 patients that were randomised to treatment, 373 completed to week 52. 134 entered the 
follow-on stage where no treatment was given. 
All primary and secondary endpoints achieved statistical significance at the two-sided 5% level 
adjusted for multiplicity. 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population was the primary population for efficacy analyses and consisted of 
all randomised participants who received at least one dose of study medication. 
For each co-primary endpoint, the p-value for comparing the treatment groups was based on the non-
parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The difference in median change from Baseline with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) was estimated by quantile regression using a bootstrap approach with 
covariates of treatment group, region, baseline score and loge baseline blood eosinophil count. 
The median change from baseline in total endoscopic NP score at week 52 was -1.0 (p<0.001) in 
favour of mepolizumab.  The adjusted treatment difference in medians (Quantile Regression)- 0.73. 
For the other co-primary endpoint the median change from baseline in mean nasal obstruction VAS 
score during the 4 weeks prior to Week 52 (i.e. weeks 49-52) showed a difference of -3.59 in favour of 
mepolizumab (p<0.001). 
Thus, the primary objectives to show superiority of mepolizumab to placebo were formally met. 
The results of the sensitivity analyses performed (including as-observed analysis taking into account all 
data in patients who receive SCS for any reason or missing data) were similar and support the results 
from the primary analysis. 
The MAH was requested to conduct additional analyses for the co-primary endpoints. Post-hoc 
supplementary analyses were carried out using a regression-based parametric mixed model repeated 
measures (MMRM) approach for the co-primary endpoints. 
For the co-primary endpoint Week 52 in Total Endoscopic Nasal Polyps Score using multiple imputation 
missing at random (MAR) showed an LS Mean difference of -0.99 (-1.36, -0.61) p < 0.001. 
Using an off-treatment imputation an LS Mean difference of -0.93 (-1.31, -0.55) p < 0.001. These 
were similar to the initial analysis results. 
For the other co-primary endpoint there were lower results observed in the Weeks 49-52 in Nasal 
Obstruction VAS Score. 
For MAR, the LS mean difference was -1.97 (-2.63, -1.31) p < 0.001, and with off treatment 
imputation the LS Mean difference was -1.86 (-2.52, -1.19) p < 0.001. These are below the MCID (> 
3) quoted by the MAH.   
The Applicant was requested to further justify the clinical relevance for results seen in the Weeks 49-
52 in Nasal Obstruction VAS Score and the responses were accepted as clinically meaningful.

Subgroup analyses show consistent results across demographic and baseline characteristics, however 
for gender, the NPS showed no effect in males even though 139 males were enrolled while it would be 
expected that both males and females would respond similarly. There is no apparent biological 
rationale to suspect that there would be a difference in outcomes between genders. As well no effect 
seemed also demonstrated in patients that had 2 or more surgeries. However, additional subgroup 
analyses provided by the MAH using MMRM upon CHMP request, demonstrated that effects are seen in 
these 2 subgroups,  therefore the issue in these two populations was considered solved and not 
relevant for further investigation. 
Secondary endpoints 
o  Participants with nasal surgery prior to Week 52 showed a lower percentage of patients treated 
with mepolizumab needing surgery (9% of patients) compared to 23% in the placebo group. 
HR 0.43. 
o  Change from baseline in median overall VAS symptom score during the 4 weeks prior to 
Week 52, was in favour of Mepolizumab treatment versus placebo -3.58 (adjusted -3.18, p < 
0.001). 
o  Change from baseline in Sino-nasal Outcome Test – 22 item (SNOT-22) total score at Week 52 
showed a median difference of -16.0, (adjusted -16.49, p < 0.001) this is above the MCID of 
8.9. 
o  The proportion of participants requiring systemic steroids for nasal polyps up to Week 52 was 
lower 12% in patients receiving mepolizumab. Odds ratio 0.58. 
o  Change from baseline in the mean composite VAS score (combining VAS scores for nasal 
obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat and loss of smell) during the 4 weeks prior to 
Week 52, showed a favourable effect in mepolizumab versus placebo with a median difference 
of -3.07 (adjusted -2.68, p < 0.001) 
Change from baseline in mean individual VAS symptom score for loss of smell during the 4 weeks prior 
to Week 52, a median difference of -0.53 (adjusted -0.37, p <0.001). At Week 52, the median change 
from baseline in UPSIT was 0.0 in both treatment groups. The difference between treatment groups 
was not statistically significant (p=0.302). Accounting for treatment group, country, baseline score and 
log(e) baseline blood eosinophil count, the difference in adjusted medians between treatment groups 
was 0.40 (95% CI: -1.49, 2.28). 
A total of 134 participants (33%) entered the no-treatment follow-up period after Week 52, 69 
participants (33%) in the mepolizumab group and 65 participants (32%) in the placebo group. 
At Week 76, 24 weeks after the end of the treatment period, the change from Baseline for total 
endoscopic nasal polyp score remained greater for participants in the mepolizumab group (median 
change: -1.0, mean change: -1.2, range: -6 to 3, SD: 1.80) than the placebo group (median change: -
0.0, mean change: -0.1, range: -4 to 4, SD: 1.59). There was no evidence of rebound effects during 
the follow up period. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The Paediatric committee granted a product-specific waiver on the ground that mepolizumab (in the 
treatment of CRSwNP) did not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatment for 
paediatric patients. The applicant proposed to add the following information to the SmPC which is 
acceptable. 
Children less than 18 years old 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021

The safety and efficacy in children with CRSwNP below the age of 18 years have not been established 
(see section 4.2 of the SmPC). No data are available. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The effects of mepolizumab as an add-on therapy to intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of 
adult patients with inadequately controlled severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps have been 
sufficiently demonstrated.  
The final indication granted by CHMP is as follows: 
Nucala is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of adult 
patients with severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery do not 
provide adequate disease control.´ 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data from the 512 participants with CRSwNP (259 exposed to mepolizumab) participating in the 
2 completed placebo-controlled studies, a Phase III study 205687 and a Phase II study MPP111782, 
have been integrated. The 100 mg subcutaneous (SC) dose of mepolizumab (NUCALA), which is the 
dose intended for registration, was assessed in the pivotal Phase III placebo-controlled study 205687 
and the 750 mg intravenous (IV) dose was assessed in the supportive Phase II placebo-controlled 
study MPP111782. Key safety data from the broader MAH-sponsored mepolizumab clinical 
development program have also been integrated. 
CRSwNP Placebo-Controlled Studies: The 2 completed MAH-sponsored placebo-controlled studies in 
the CRSwNP indication, 205687 and MPP111782, were integrated and are referred to as “CRSwNP 
Placebo-Controlled Studies”; these data are the primary focus of this safety summary. 
All Studies Combined: The study grouping referred to as “All Studies Combined” comprises of 
completed MAH-sponsored studies and ongoing studies with an interim report across all indications. 
The integrated summaries of demographics, exposure, incidence of SAEs, and deaths are presented. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 259 participants received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab in the CRSwNP placebo-controlled 
studies. Of these, 206 participants were treated with mepolizumab 100 mg SC and 53 participants 
were treated with mepolizumab 750 mg IV. Total treatment exposure in the CRSwNP placebo-
controlled studies was 207.32 subject-years in the integrated placebo group and 216.44 subject-years 
in the mepolizumab all doses group (194.79 subject-years in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group and 
21.65 subject-years in the mepolizumab 750 mg IV group (Table 34). By the study design, the study 
treatment duration was 52 weeks for Study 205687 and was 24 weeks for Study MPP111782. 
The majority of participants (88% mepolizumab and 84% placebo) in Study 205687 were exposed to 
study treatment for 52 weeks; 87% of mepolizumab-treated participants and 80% of placebo-treated 
participants received 13 doses of study treatment. Two participants in the mepolizumab group and 8 
participants in the placebo group received less than 13 doses over 52 weeks. 
For Study MPP111782, 72% of mepolizumab-treated participants and 52% of placebo-treated 
participants were exposed to study treatment for 24 weeks; 79% of mepolizumab-treated participants 
and 63% of placebo-treated participants received 6 doses of study treatment; Four participants in the 
mepolizumab group and 6 participants in the placebo group received 6 doses in less than 24.

Table 34: Summary of Exposure to Study Treatment by Dose (CRSwNP Placebo-Controlled 
Studies), Safety Population 
Extent of Exposure in All Indications (All Studies Combined) 
A total of 4363 participants received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab in a MAH-sponsored study or 
program, and 2087 participants received placebo (Table 35). 
Across all indications, total treatment exposure for the 2722 participants who received mepolizumab 
100 mg SC was 4035.87 subject-years, and for the 446 participants who received mepolizumab  
750 mg IV, this was 517.69 subject-years. The 750 mg IV dose group in the summary tables does not 
include those participants who received 750 mg IV in the mepolizumab HES EAP (all participants 
receiving mepolizumab in the mepolizumab HES EAP are included in the ‘other’ dose group).

Adverse events  
Table 37 shows the proportion of participants reporting the most common on-treatment AEs (defined 
as AEs with an incidence of ≥3% in any treatment group) in the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies 
and the corresponding event rate adjusted for exposure (frequency of events per 1000 subject-years 
of exposure). 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021

The incidence of on-treatment AEs was similar between the placebo (83%) and mepolizumab all doses 
groups (81%). The most frequently reported on-treatment AEs were nasopharyngitis and headache in 
both groups. Participants treated with placebo had a higher incidence of headache, asthma, and 
sinusitis than participants treated with mepolizumab (≥5% difference). There were no individual AE 
where incidence was ≥5% higher in the mepolizumab all doses group compared with the placebo 
group. 
The SOC with the highest incidence of on-treatment AEs in both treatment groups was Infections and 
Infestations, the incidence was 63% in the placebo group and 54% in the mepolizumab all doses 
group. None of SOCs where there was ≥10% difference between treatment groups. 
Relative risks using the CMH method were calculated for the most common on-treatment AEs for 
placebo and mepolizumab (all doses), together with the corresponding CMH-adjusted proportions 
(Figure 28). 
The relative risk for mepolizumab vs. placebo was ≥2.0 for AEs of rash and arthralgia: 3.1% of  
participants (8/259) in the mepolizumab group and 0.8% of participants (2/253) in the placebo group 
reported rash with the RR of 3.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 18.21); 6.2% of participants (16/259) in the 
mepolizumab group and 3.2% of participants (8/253) in the placebo group reported arthralgia with the 
RR of 1.95 (95% CI: 0.85, 4.49). The relative risk for mepolizumab vs. placebo was ≤0.5 for the AEs 
of asthma, ear pain, fatigue, sinusitis, otitis media, and nasal polyps.

•  Adverse Events by Maximum Intensity 
In the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies, the majority of participants reported on treatment AEs with 
a maximum intensity of mild or moderate (66% in the placebo group and 68% in the mepolizumab all 
doses group). The incidence of events of severe intensity was 15% in the placebo group and 11% in 
the mepolizumab all doses group. Headache was the most frequently reported severe AE for both 
treatment groups (3% each group). The other severe AEs, which occurred with an incidence of 2%, 
were Nasopharyngitis and fatigue in the placebo group. 
•  Drug-Related Adverse Events 
The overall incidence of on-treatment AEs considered by the investigator to be related to study 
treatment was 14% in the mepolizumab all doses group and 9% in the placebo group (Table 38). 
Headache was the most frequently reported drug-related AE for both treatment groups.

•  Adverse Events Reported on the Day of Dosing 
The overall incidence of AEs reported on the day of dosing (pre- or post-dose) was comparable 
between treatment groups, 26% in the placebo group and 24% in the mepolizumab all doses group 
(Table 39). The most frequently reported AE on the day of dosing was headache for both treatment 
groups.

• 
Post-Treatment Adverse Events 
For the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies, post-treatment AEs were defined as any event which 
started more than 28 days after the last dose of study treatment; this included all events reported 
during the no-treatment post-week 52 follow-up period of Study. Post-treatment AEs were reported in 
18% (46/253) of participants in the placebo group and 17% (44/259) in the mepolizumab all doses 
group. Post-treatment AEs which occurred with an incidence of ≥2% included headache (3%), 
nasopharyngitis, cough, and 
ear pain (2% each) in the placebo group and nasopharyngitis (3%), back pain, headache, and sinusitis 
(2% each) in the mepolizumab group. In Study 205687, 134 participants (65, 32% in the placebo 
group and 69, 33% in the mepolizumab group) were enrolled in a No Treatment Post-Week 52 Follow-
up Period and were followed-up for additional 24 weeks. The incidence of non-serious AEs in the no 
treatment post-week 52 follow-up period was 20% in each treatment group (13/65 placebo and 14/69 
mepolizumab); the incidence of SAEs was 6% in the placebo group and 3% in the mepolizumab group. 
The most frequently reported AE was headache (5, 8%) in the placebo group and nasopharyngitis (6, 
9%) in the mepolizumab group.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Within the mepolizumab clinical development program, the following are considered AESIs: systemic 
(allergic [Type I hypersensitivity] and other systemic) reactions, local injection site reactions, 
infections (including potentially opportunistic), malignancies, and cardiac disorders including serious 
cardiac, vascular, and thromboembolic (CVT) events and serious ischemic events. 
The relative risk and risk difference for SAEs and AESIs in the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies are 
presented in Table 40 and Figure 29. Infections were the most frequently reported AESI category for 
both treatment groups (63% for placebo, 54% for mepolizumab all doses. With the exception of all 
infections, participant numbers in each category of AESIs were low (≤5%).

Controlled Studies), Safety Population 
•  Systemic Reactions 
Systemic reactions were collected via a targeted eCRF in Study 205687 only. Therefore, systemic 
reactions in Study 205687 and AEs identified by MAH as hypersensitivity in Study MPP111782 are 
presented separately below.  
In Study 205687, systemic reactions were reported in 3 participants: systemic allergic (type I 
hypersensitivity) reactions in 2 participants in the mepolizumab group and other systemic reactions in 
1 participant in the placebo group (Table 40). All events were nonserious, mild or moderate in 
intensity, considered related to study treatment by the investigator, resolved, and did not lead to 
discontinuation of study treatment.  
One event was considered to represent a potential hypersensitivity reaction following the MAH review 
of AEs in Study MPP111782. 
Anaphylaxis 
In Study 205687, systemic reactions were collected via a targeted eCRF, and investigators were asked 
to assess systemic reactions against Sampson’s criteria of anaphylaxis. There were no events of 
systemic reactions meeting Sampson’s criteria for anaphylaxis in Study 205687, and no other events 
of anaphylaxis reported in Study 205687 or MPP117872.  
• 
Local Injection Site Reactions 
Local injection site reactions were collected via targeted eCRF in Study 205687 only. In Study 205687, 
AEs of local injection site reactions were reported in 7 participants (2 with 5 events in the placebo 
group and 5 with 6 events in the mepolizumab group). All events in both treatment groups were non-
serious, of mild intensity, resolved, and did not lead to discontinuation of study treatment. All AEs of 
local injection site reactions but 1 were considered to be drug-related by the investigator. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 102/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With the exceptions of 2 participants*, all received 13 doses of study treatment and completed the 
study. (*Note: 1 participant in the placebo group discontinued study treatment due to a protocol 
deviation and 1 participant in the mepolizumab group was consent withdrawn from the study due to 
moving out of the area where the clinical study was being conducted.) 
• 
Infections 
The incidence of on-treatment AEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC in the CRSwNP placebo-
controlled studies was 63% (160/253) in the placebo group and 54% (140/259) in the mepolizumab 
all doses group. The most frequently reported event within the SOC was nasopharyngitis for both 
treatment groups. The incidence of individual AEs where there was ≥5% difference between treatment 
groups was sinusitis (9% placebo, 4% mepolizumab). 
Serious Infections 
SAEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC were reported in 4 participants in the placebo group and 1 
participant in the mepolizumab group, all in Study 205687. Pneumonia was reported in 2 participants 
(1 in each treatment group). The remaining SAEs in the placebo group were acute sinusitis*, cellulitis, 
influenza, and periorbital cellulitis*. All events resolved with continued study treatment and no events 
were considered drug-related by the investigator. (*Note: SAEs of acute sinusitis and periorbital 
cellulitis were reported in 1 participant in the placebo group on the same day.) 
Potential Opportunistic Infections 
AEs of potential opportunistic infections in the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies were reported in 8 
participants (3%) in the placebo group and 4 participants (2%) in the mepolizumab all doses group. 
According to Expert opinion on the criteria for opportunistic infections in the setting of biological 
therapy, herpes simplex infections are considered opportunistic only when invasive. In the CRSwNP 
placebo-controlled studies, the reported events of oral herpes, herpes simplex, and genital herpes are 
unlikely to represent an invasive disease based on being reported as non-serious, of mild intensity and 
verbatim terms suggestive of localized infection (e.g., cold sore). Similarly, the events of candida 
infection (verbatim term “thrush”) are unlikely to represent an invasive disease based on event 
characteristics. The events of herpes zoster and oropharyngeal candidiasis meet the criteria for 
opportunistic infections by Winthrop in 2015. 
All events in both studies were non-serious, mild/moderate in intensity, resolved, not considered drug-
related by the investigator, and did not lead to permanent discontinuation of study treatment. An AE of 
herpes zoster in 1 participant in the placebo group in Study 205687 led to study treatment 
interruption. With the exception of 2 participants* in the placebo group in Study 205687, all completed 
study treatment and completed the study. (*Note: 2 participants in the placebo group in Study 205687 
were consent withdrawn from the study. 
•  Malignancies 
On-treatment AESI in the category of malignancies were reported in 2 participants, both in the placebo 
group in Study 205687. Both events (renal neoplasm and basal cell carcinoma) were non-serious, not 
considered related to study treatment by the investigator, and did not lead to discontinuation of study 
treatment. No malignancies were reported in MPP111782. 
•  Serious Cardiac, Vascular, and Thromboembolic Events and Serious Ischemic Events 
On-treatment serious CVT events were reported in 3 participants (2 in the placebo group and 1 in the 
mepolizumab group), all in Study 205687. All events were resolved. The event of transient ischemic 
attack in the placebo-treated participant was considered by the investigator to be related to study 
Assessment report

Page 103/129 
 
 
 
 
treatment. The event of myocardial infarction in the mepolizumab-treated participant led to the 
interruption of study treatment.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The overall incidence of SAEs in the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies was generally similar between 
mepolizumab all doses and placebo groups. In Study 205687, the incidence of on-treatment SAEs was 
comparable between treatment groups. In Study MPP111782, no SAEs were reported. 
The incidence of on-treatment non-fatal SAEs in the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies was similar 
between placebo and mepolizumab all doses groups (5% each treatment group) (Table 41). On-
treatment non-fatal SAEs that occurred in more than 1 participant within a treatment group were 
anemia and contusion (2 each in the mepolizumab group). With the exception of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus in the mepolizumab group, all events were resolved. An SAE of transient ischemic attack in 
the placebo group was considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment.

included abortion missed, anemia*, asthma, deep vein thrombosis*, duodenal ulcer, myocardial 
infarction, pulmonary embolism*, and urticaria. SAEs reported in the mepolizumab group included 
back pain, pneumonia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. (*Note: Three SAEs were reported in 1 placebo-
treated participant.) 
A summary of frequently reported on-treatment nonfatal SAEs in the placebo and mepolizumab all 
doses group is presented in Table 42.

Deaths 
No deaths were reported in Study MPP111782. No deaths were reported during the 52-week treatment 
period in Study 205687. One death due to an SAE of myocardial infarction in the placebo group in 
Study 205687 was reported during follow-up after Week 52. 
Laboratory findings 
•  Clinical Chemistry 
On-Treatment Chemistry Data Change from Baseline 
In Study 205687, clinical chemistry assessments were performed at baseline, Week 52, early 
withdrawal, and as clinically indicated. The definition of an on-treatment sample was one taken after 
the first dose and within 28 days after the last dose. Samples taken more than 28 days after last dose 
are defined as post-treatment. For completeness, in addition to the planned presentation of on-
treatment clinical laboratory evaluations, post-hoc presentations of on- and post-treatment data were 
prepared. There were no meaningful differences between the on-treatment and on- and post-
treatment data, and therefore this section presents on- and post-treatment results. In Study 
MPP111782, clinical chemistry assessments were performed at baseline, at Week 2, and every 4 weeks 
thereafter up to Week 24. 
There was no evidence of treatment effect on clinical chemistry parameters for both studies. For all 
post-baseline clinical chemistry parameters in the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies, the majority of 
participants in each treatment group had values shift to the normal range or no change. Shifts from 
baseline in clinical chemistry parameters with an incidence ≥10% in integrated treatment group was 
glucose (to high; 12% placebo and 9% mepolizumab). The incidence of clinical chemistry parameter 
values outside the normal range at any time post-baseline occurred with comparable incidence across 
the treatment groups, with the exception of urea in Study MPP111782 (10% placebo and 19% 
mepolizumab). 
One participant (in the placebo group) in Study MPP111782 had a clinical chemistry change from 
baseline that met pre-defined potential clinical importance (PCI) value. This participant had a high 
calcium value of PCI at Week 9 during the study; the calcium values were within normal reference 
range at baseline and at all the rest of the post baseline assessments. 
No participants in Study 205687 had clinical chemistry change from baseline values of PCI. No clinical 
chemistry abnormalities were reported as AEs in both studies. 
• 
Liver Function Tests 
In the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies, there were no possible ‘Hy’s Law’ events (i.e., drug-induced 
liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia, defined as alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ≥3x upper limit of 
normal [ULN] and bilirubin ≥2x ULN [>35% direct] [or ALT ≥3x ULN and international normalized ratio 
[INR] >1.5, if INR measured]). 
No participant had liver function test values that met protocol-defined liver chemistry 
monitoring/stopping criteria. 
•  Hematology 
Laboratory parameters for hematology that were assessed in both Study 205687 and MPP111782 were 
integrated. Eosinophil data were pharmacodynamics assessments in both studies and are presented in 
the Summary of Clinical Pharmacology. With the exception of blood eosinophil counts, there were no 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021

evidence of treatment effect on hematology parameters. For most post-baseline hematology 
parameters in the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies, the majority of participants in each treatment 
group had values shift to the normal range or no change. The incidence of hematology parameter 
values outside the normal range at any time post-baseline occurred with comparable incidence across 
the treatment groups, with the exceptions of eosinophils and leukocytes. Shifts from baseline in 
hematology parameters with an incidence ≥10% in either integrated treatment group are presented in 
Table 43. 
Table 43: On- and Post-Treatment hematology Data Changes from Baseline Relative to the 
Normal Range Any Time Post-baseline (Incidence ≥10% in either Integrated Treatment 
Group) (CRSwNP Placebo-Controlled Studies), Safety Population 
One participant in the mepolizumab group in Study 205687 had hematology laboratory values that met 
the pre-defined criteria for low values of PCI. Of 4 participants who reported anemia, 2 cases were 
reported as SAEs. 
Vital Signs 
Mean values for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate were similar to 
baseline throughout the course of CRSwNP studies for both placebo and mepolizumab all doses groups.  
• 
ECG 
In Study 205687, electrocardiograms (ECGs) were assessed at baseline, at Week 52 (4 weeks after the 
last dose) and at early withdrawal visit. In Study MPP111782, ECGs were assessed at baseline, at 
Week 2, and at each 4-week visit thereafter, as well as at early withdrawal visit. The majority of 
participants had normal ECGs at baseline and at post-baseline visits in both studies and summarized in 
the respective CSRs. No participants had a clinically significant ECG during the studies. 
QTc Intervals 
On- and post-treatment maximum value of QTc interval and maximum change from baseline are 
presented in Table 44. No participants in Study MPP111782 met the protocol-defined QTc stopping 
criteria (defined as QTc >500 msec or change from baseline >60 msec). 
QTc values that met protocols-defined stopping criteria were reported in 7 participants (4 in the 
placebo group and 3 in the mepolizumab group) in Study 205687. All of values were from Week 52 (4 
weeks after the last dose of study treatment). No follow-up ECGs were available for these participants.

AEs reported by these participants were unremarkable compared to the AEs reported by other 
participants in the study. No QT prolongation-related AE was reported during the study.

• 
Immunogenicity Results 
Serum samples were assessed for immunogenicity using a tiered analysis approach with validated 
assays: 1) for binding anti-drug antibodies (ADA): screening, confirmation, and titration analysis; and 
2) for neutralizing antibodies (NAb). Both Study 205687 and MMP111782 used the same methods to 
detect binding ADA (6th generation assay) and NAb (3rd generation assay). Both binding ADA and Nab 
assay life cycles have been captured in the Integrated Summary of Immunogenicity for Mepolizumab. 
Both programs used the same generation binding ADA and NAb assays as the mepolizumab severe 
asthma clinical program. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 110/129 
 
 
 
 
In Study 205687, serum samples for binding ADA analyses were collected at baseline, Week 52 (end of 
treatment), and at early withdrawal visits (if applicable). Participants who entered the post-Week 52 
follow-up period had an additional sample taken at Week 68. 
In Study MPP111782, serum samples were collected for binding ADA analyses at baseline, Week 5, 
Week 13, Week 25 (exit or early withdrawal), and follow-up (4-6 months after the last dose). 
In CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies, 3% (6/237) of participants in the placebo group and 2% 
(6/249) of participants in the mepolizumab group were positive for binding ADA any time post-
baseline. Treatment emergent ADA participants had titer values of 32 or less, similar to other 
indications using mepolizumab. None of the participants were positive for neutralizing. 
For participants who were ADA positive post-baseline in Study 205687, 8 participants (3 placebo and 5 
mepolizumab) reported at least 1 on-treatment AE. AEs reported in more than 1 participant were acute 
sinusitis, headache, and rhinitis (1 participant in each treatment group for all these 3 individual AEs).

Safety in special populations 
•  Adverse Events by Age 
In the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies, the majority of participants in both treatment groups were 
aged 18 to 64 years. The incidence of on-treatment AEs in this age group was similar to that observed 
in the Safety Population (83% in the placebo group and 81% in the mepolizumab all doses group) 
(Table 46). The most frequently reported AEs were nasopharyngitis and headache in both treatment 
groups. 
Sixty-seven participants (32 placebo and 35 mepolizumab) were aged ≥65 years. The incidence of on-
treatment AEs in this age group was 81% (26/32) in the placebo group and 77% (27/35) in the 
mepolizumab group. Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported AE in both treatment groups.

•  Adverse Events by Gender 
The incidence of AEs within each gender was similar for placebo and mepolizumab in all doses groups. 
Headache and nasopharyngitis were the most frequently reported AEs for both gender subgroups for 
both placebo and mepolizumab all doses groups (Table 47).

•  Adverse Events by Race 
Most participants in the Safety Population were White (94%). Amongst White participants, the 
incidence of on-treatment AEs and the incidence of the most frequently reported SOC and preferred 
terms was similar to that observed in the Safety Population. 
Given the low proportion of participants in the Safety Population who were of Asian (4%), African 
American/African Heritage (2%), or Multiple Race (<1%), there is a limited ability to compare the 
incidence and pattern of on-treatment AEs in these subgroups to the Safety Population. 
•  Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
During the conduct of the mepolizumab clinical development program, female subjects were required 
to commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control (defined as the failure 
rate of <1%) from the time of consent, for the duration of the study, and for 4 months after the last 
dose of study drug administration. 
As of 23 September 2019 (cut-off date for current Investigator’s Brochure), 33 pregnancies were 
reported for 31 female subjects receiving investigational product in the completed and ongoing 
mepolizumab studies (all indications) (Table 48). Of the 33 pregnancies, 2 were reported in subjects 
who received placebo. There was 1 report of congenital anomalies for the live births (see description 
below). Two additional pregnancies were reported for the female partners of study subjects: 1 on 
placebo which resulted in spontaneous abortion (Study SB-240563/035), 1 on mepolizumab 100 mg 
SC which resulted in live birth with congenital anomaly (study 201312). These exposures via partner 
cases are not included in Table 48.

Table 48: Reported Pregnancies in the Mepolizumab Clinical Development Program 
(Completed and Ongoing GSK-Sponsored Studies and Expanded Access Program; Status as 
of 23 September 2019) 
The live birth of a healthy neonate in Study 201810 (Table 48) was reported for a female participant 
who was randomized to continued mepolizumab 100 mg SC in Part C of the study. The live birth with 
congenital anomalies of low hemoglobin, mild pulmonary valve stenosis, and heart murmur in Study 
205687 (Table 48) was reported for a female participant who received mepolizumab 100 mg SC. The 
pregnancy was confirmed after the 4th dose of mepolizumab, and study treatment was discontinued. 
Another female participant in Study 205687 (Table 48), who was randomized to receive placebo, 
reported a missed abortion 41 days after her first dose of placebo and was withdrawn from the study. 
•  Overdose 
The dose of mepolizumab considered to be an overdose has not been defined. Single doses of up to 
1500 mg have been administered intravenously without evidence of dose-related toxicities. There are 
no known antidotes and the MAH does not recommend a specific treatment in the event of a suspected 
overdose. Clinical judgment should be used in treating the symptoms of a suspected overdose. 
•  Drug Abuse 
There is no evidence for and no anticipation of patient abuse of mepolizumab 
• 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
There have been no studies to investigate the effect of mepolizumab on driving performance or the 
ability to operate machinery. A detrimental effect on such activities would not be anticipated from the 
pharmacology or adverse reaction profile of mepolizumab. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with mepolizumab in participants with severe 
bilateral nasal polyposis. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
By study design, participants who permanently discontinued study treatment in Study MPP111782 
were withdrawn from the study and AEs which led to withdrawal from the study are presented 
elsewhere. In Study 205687, participants who permanently discontinued study treatment could 
continue in the study off study treatment. Therefore, AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment 
Assessment report

are presented for Study 205687 only. In Study 205687, 4 participants (2%) in each treatment group 
discontinued treatment due to an AE (Table 49). Of these 8 participants, all but 1 placebo-treated 
participant* remained in the study. 
Two events leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment (focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis in 1 participant and pancreatitis acute in 1 participant) were reported as SAEs, both 
occurred in the placebo group. Four events leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment in 
2 participants were considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment: eczema in 1 
participant in the placebo group; abdominal pain upper, diarrhea, and headache in 1 participant in the 
mepolizumab group. 
Table 49: Adverse Events Leading to Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment (Study 
205687), Safety Population 
Study Treatment Interruption 
On-treatment AEs/SAEs led to study treatment interruption in 4 participants in the placebo group 
(herpes zoster, cellulitis*†, rash†, nasal polyps, and viral upper respiratory tract infection) and in  
2 participants in the mepolizumab group (depressive symptom, hiatus hernia*†, and myocardial 
infarction*†). None of these events were considered by the investigator to be related to study 
treatment. (*Note: the events were SAEs. †Note: the events reported by the same participant.) 
Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study 
As described previously, participants who permanently discontinued study treatment in Study 
MPP111782 were withdrawn from the study. In the CRSwNP placebo-controlled studies, 9 participants 
(6, 2% in the placebo group and 3, 1% in the mepolizumab group) were withdrawn from the study due 
to their AEs (Table 50). All participants but 1 were in Study MPP111782. No individual AE leading to 
Assessment report

withdrawal was reported in more than 1 participant. Events of rash and toxic skin eruption in the 
mepolizumab group in Study MPP111782 were considered by the investigator to be drug-related.

Controlled Studies), Safety Population 
Post marketing experience 
At the time of submission, the most recent PBRER/EU-PSUR has a cut-off date of 23 September 2019. 
The cumulative exposure to NUCALA in the post-marketing setting is estimated to be 76,383 patient-
years. 
The safety profile of mepolizumab from post-marketing sources remains generally similar to that 
known at initial market authorization. During the post-marketing period, following a review of 
spontaneous post-marketing reports of anaphylaxis, the mepolizumab label was updated to include 
“anaphylaxis” in the existing Warning regarding hypersensitivity reactions and in the Adverse 
Reactions section. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data from the 512 participants with CRSwNP (259 exposed to mepolizumab) participating in the 
2 completed placebo-controlled studies (Phase III study 205687 and Phase II study MPP111782) have 
been integrated. The 100 mg subcutaneous (SC) dose of mepolizumab (NUCALA) was assessed in the 
pivotal Phase III placebo-controlled study 205687 and the 750 mg intravenous (IV) dose was assessed 
in the supportive Phase II placebo-controlled study MPP111782. Key safety data from the broader 
MAH-sponsored mepolizumab clinical development program have also been integrated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 116/129 
 
 
 
 
The overall incidence and percentage of CRSwNP patients that experienced any AE was similar across 
all main studies, 81% and 83% in mepolizumab and placebo treatment arms respectively. The most 
common AEs were nasopharyngitis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, back pain and epistaxis.  
Across both studies, the CMH adjusted relative risk was highest for the PT rash at 3.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 
18.21) in the mepolizumab all doses group compared with the placebo group. Rash is considered 
expected for mepolizumab and is included in the SPC under systemic non-allergic administration-
related reactions. Most of these AEs were mild to moderate in severity.  
Headache was the most common adverse reaction and the most common AE to occur on the day of 
treatment, headache is expected as per the Nucala SmPC with a frequency of very common. Other 
adverse reactions occurred in ≤1% of subjects.  
The SOC with the highest incidence of on-treatment AEs in both treatment groups was Infections and 
Infestations, the incidence was 63% in the placebo group and 54% in the mepolizumab all doses 
group. 
AESI include systemic reactions, local injection site reactions, infections, malignancies, and 
cardiovascular safety events.  
Systemic reactions including hypersensitivity reactions occurred with a higher frequency in 
mepolizumab-treated participants, with a RR of 1.95. This is in line with hypersensitivity reactions 
being listed in the SmPC section 4.8 with a frequency of common, while systemic reactions are 
considered an important identified risk in the RMP and subject to routine risk minimisation procedures. 
In addition, a targeted follow-up questionnaire is used to collect data on severe 
hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis. The following text is proposed to be added to the SmPC section 4.8. and 
is accepted “In the 52-week placebo-controlled study, systemic allergic (type I hypersensitivity) 
reactions were reported in 2 patients (<1%) in the group receiving Nucala 100 mg and in no patients 
in the placebo group. Other systemic reactions were reported by no patients in the group receiving 
mepolizumab 100 mg and in 1 patient (<1%) in the placebo group.”  
Injection site reactions occurred with a higher frequency in mepolizumab-treated participants, with a 
RR of 2.44. This is in line with Injection site reactions being listed in the SmPC section 4.8 with a 
frequency of common. All events were non-serious, of mild intensity and resolved and plausibly related 
to the method of administration. The following text is proposed to be added to the SmPC which is 
accepted “In the placebo-controlled study, injection site reactions (e.g., erythema, pruritus) occurred 
at a rate of 2% in patients receiving mepolizumab 100 mg compared with <1% in patients receiving 
placebo.“ 
Infections and serious infections occurred with a lower frequency in mepolizumab-treated participants, 
with a RR of 0.85 and 0.29 respectively and does not raise any concerns. The most frequently reported 
event within the SOC was nasopharyngitis for both treatment groups.  
No malignancies were reported in mepolizumab-treated participants. Serious Cardiac, Vascular, 
Thromboembolic and Ischemic Events occurred at a lower frequency in mepolizumab-treated 
participants than placebo patients. Alterations in immune response (malignancies) and alterations in 
cardiovascular safety are important potential risks in the RMP, subject to routine risk minimisation 
procedures. In addition, targeted follow-up questionnaires are employed to collect data on MI/Unstable 
Angina, Cerebral Vascular Accident/Transient Ischemic Attack, Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary 
Embolism and Peripheral Arterial Thromboembolism. 
Overall, for the AESIs where an imbalance in frequency was observed for mepolizumab-treated 
patients compared to placebo patients, data from the CRSwNP indication is in line with previous safety 
profile of Nucala and appropriately risk minimised. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 117/129 
 
 
 
On-treatment non-fatal SAEs that occurred in more than 1 participant within a treatment group were 
anaemia and contusion (2 each in the mepolizumab group). One SAE of anaemia was mild in severity 
and the patient was hospitalised along with numerous cardiac issues, the other case was likely caused 
by bleeding associated with erosive gastritis and unlikely to be related to mepolizumab.  Based on case 
narratives the SAEs of contusion were likely related to injury. Other SAEs occurred in no more than 
one subject. 
The SOC with the highest number of SAEs in the mepolizumab group was the cardiac disorder SOC (6 
v 0 SAEs in the mepolizumab group compared to the placebo group). Cardiovascular, thrombotic and 
ischemic disorders are discussed elsewhere as AESIs. No SAE in the mepolizumab group was 
considered related to the IMP. 
The only fatality in the nasal polyp trials occurred in the placebo group and therefore raises no safety 
concerns. 
For the majority of chemistry laboratory results, haematological laboratory results, and liver function 
tests there was no evidence of treatment effect. Exceptions included eosinophils and leukocytes which 
is expected and linked to the mechanism of action of the IMP; and urea where an imbalance between 
arms for values outside the normal range was noted. This was only observed in Study MPP111782 
(10% placebo and 19% mepolizumab) and not in the pivotal study.  
Mean values for vital signs were similar to baseline throughout the course of CRSwNP studies for both 
placebo and mepolizumab all doses groups, with the majority of patients having results in the normal 
ranges.  
Immunogenicity with mepolizumab in CRSwNP patients was low at 3% in the pivotal study and 2% 
across both studies. This is in line with the level of immunogenicity seen in severe asthma patients. No 
neutralising antibodies were detected in any patient that tested positive for ADAs. The SmPC section 
5.1. has been updated accordingly.  
Mepolizumab is not indicated for paediatric or adolescent CRSwNP patients and the clinical trial 
programme did not recruit this age group. In patients greater than 65 years of age, headache occurred 
with a greater frequency in mepolizumab patients compared to placebo and younger patients, however 
this AE is already listed as expected in the SmPC. Otherwise, in patients less than or greater than 65 
years, the safety profile is broadly similar across both treatment arms, although numbers are low in 
the over 65 years group. This is in line with no dose adjustment being required for elderly patients as 
per SmPC. There was a low number of Asian (4%), African American/African Heritage (2%), or Multiple 
Race (<1%) CRSwNP patients treated with mepolizumab limiting safety analysis in these sub-groups.   
The incidence of AEs across both treatment arms was generally similar regardless of sex, the number 
of females recruited to both studies were lower than for males.  
No formal studies have been performed on renal and hepatic impairment, however, based on 
population pharmacokinetic analyses no dose adjustment is required in patients with creatinine 
clearance values between 50-80 mL/min, while changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any 
effect on the elimination of mepolizumab due to mepolizumab being degraded by widely distributed 
proteolytic enzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue. Renal and hepatic impairment have not been 
discussed by the MAH in relation to CRSwNP patients, however no differences are anticipated in these 
patients.  
The numbers of pregnancies in mepolizumab-treated clinical trial subjects is low (n=33) and as per the 
SmPC use in pregnancy should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than 
any possible risk to the foetus. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560926/2021  
Page 118/129 
 
 
 
The levels of discontinuations, treatment interruptions and withdrawals due to AEs was low across both 
treatment groups, and the same or lower for mepolizumab treated patients compared to placebo-
treated patients and raises no concerns. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of mepolizumab in CRSwNP patients is consistent with the known safety 
profile of mepolizumab. The SmPC adequately reflects the data submitted in CRSwNP patients. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
Nucala is being approved for Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), Hypereosinophilic 
Syndrome (HES) and Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP) indications in parallel at the 
same time. Therefore, an increase in PSUR frequency is warranted to monitor adequately the safety 
profile of mepolizumab in the new patient populations, mainly for the indication EPGA. The PSUR 
frequency is therefore increased to 6 monthly basis. The MAH should plan at least a further 6-month 
DLP period after the next December 2021 submission. 
Based on the above considerations, the CHMP is of the opinion that the already existing entry in the 
EURD list for mepolizumab needs to be amended as follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product 
should follow a half-yearly cycle. The next data lock point will be 23.9.2021. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH was requested to submit an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.2 is acceptable. The CHMP endorsed 
this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 7.2 with the following content:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Nasal polyps (NP) are chronic inflammatory outgrowths of the paranasal sinus mucosa (commonly the 
ethmoid sinuses) that present bilaterally along the middle and superior meatus and occur primarily in 
adults. NP greatly impacts a patient’s health-related quality of life (HRQoL) through increases in nasal 
obstruction, loss of sense of smell, facial pain, facial pressure and nasal discharge; and the persistence 
of these symptoms leads to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). NP develop in the setting of chronic paranasal 
sinus inflammation and are therefore associated with CRS.  
CRSwNP is a disease of middle age with the average age of onset being approximately 42 years and 
the typical age of diagnosis ranging from 40–60 years. Males are more likely to have CRSwNP than 
females, however, disease may be more severe in females than males. Using cross-sectional patient 
surveys of random samples of the general population, the prevalence of CRSwNP ranges from 1.1% in 
the United States of America (USA) and China to 4.3% in Finland. 
In general, up to 55% of patients with CRSwNP have asthma and the presence of NP increases with 
the severity of asthma. 
The aetiology of CRSwNP is currently unknown although, in adults, eosinophils are the main 
inflammatory cell in the substantial proportion of NP tissue and are considered potentially responsible 
for the etiopathogenesis and prognosis of the disease. In Western countries, the majority of patients 
with CRSwNP have a type 2 inflammation characterised by eosinophilia (~80%) and elevated levels of 
interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and interleukin-13 cytokines.  
In general, patients with CRSwNP have higher blood eosinophil levels than patients with CRS without 
NP (CRSsNP) and CRSwNP patients that additionally have asthma had higher eosinophil levels 
compared to CRSwNP patients without asthma. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard of care (SoC) for CRSwNP in adults is a treatment with intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) 
and nasal saline irrigation and, for severe symptoms, intermittent courses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) 
when short term relief is required. Surgery to remove the NP tissue may also be indicated for severe 
cases of CRSwNP. Surgery involves the removal of the NP tissue and diseased nasal mucosa, restoring 
aeration of the nasal passage and sinuses. However, without control of the underlying inflammation NP 
have a strong tendency to recur. 
A recent meta-analysis of surgery revision rates among patients with CRSwNP reported a mean 
revision rate of 16.2% over a weighted mean follow-up of 89.6 months: rates were higher among 
patients with asthma than without asthma (22.6% vs. 8.0%) and among patients with multiple 
previous surgeries than just one (26.4% vs. 14.3%).

Dupilumab was approved in the EU in October 2019 as an add-on therapy to Standard of Care (SoC) in 
adult patients with CRSwNP. This was the first biologic treatment to be approved in this indication. 
Omalizumab has recently been approved in the EU (July 2020). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
A single pivotal study is submitted to support the use in adult patients with CRSwNP. Study 205687 
was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, Phase III study of 
mepolizumab in adult participants with CRSwNP receiving SoC therapy. The study was designed to 
provide confirmatory evidence that mepolizumab 100 mg SC every 4 weeks is effective in improving 
symptoms, reducing NP size (as primary endpoint) and reducing the occurrence of nasal surgery in 
patients with the recurrent disease despite current optimal medical management (as secondary 
endpoint). The study enrolled 407 participants with severe, bilateral NP (CRSwNP) despite treatment 
with current SoC, a history of at least one prior surgery for NP. SoC consisted of daily mometasone 
furoate nasal spray (MF), and if required, saline nasal douching, occasional short courses of high dose 
OCS and/or antibiotics. At the start of run-in and throughout the study, participants were placed on MF 
at the maximum prescribed dose in line with local SoC. The maximum dose was 2 actuations (50 
mcg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily which equaled a total daily dose of 400 mcg. For participants 
intolerant to this dose, the lower dose of 200 mcg could have been used (2 actuations [50 
mcg/actuation] in each nostril once daily). 
The study comprised of a 4-week run-in period, followed by a 52-week treatment period. Participants 
had a history of at least one prior surgery for nasal polyps (NP) in the last 10 years, had recurrent NP 
despite treatment with current SoC and were in current need for NP surgery (at study enrolment). 
The co-primary endpoints were the change from Baseline in total ENP score at Week 52 and change 
from Baseline in nasal obstruction VAS score in the 4-week period Week 49-52.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
For the co-primary endpoint, change from Baseline in total ENP score at Week 52, the median change 
in the mepolizumab group was -1.0 compared with 0 in the placebo group (p<0.001). A greater 
proportion of participants who received mepolizumab demonstrated an improvement (decrease) of 
≥1.0 point compared with placebo in their total ENP score (50% vs 28%) at Week 52 [odds ratio: 2.74 
(95% CI: 1.80, 4.18); p<0.001].  
Similarly, a greater proportion of participants who received mepolizumab demonstrated an 
improvement (decrease) of ≥2.0 points compared with placebo in their total ENP score (36% vs 13%) 
at Week 52 [odds ratio: 4.05 (95% CI: 2.43, 6.76); p<0.001]. 
For the second co-primary endpoint, change from Baseline in nasal obstruction VAS score in the 4-
week period Week 49-52, the median change from Baseline in the mepolizumab group was -4.41 
(compared with -0.82 in the placebo group (p<0.001). The minimal important change (MIC) is 
considered to be ≥3.0). A greater proportion of participants who received mepolizumab demonstrated 
a clinically meaningful improvement (decrease) of ≥3.0 points compared with placebo in their nasal 
obstruction VAS score (60% vs 36%) in the 4-week period Week 49-52 [odds ratio: 2.66 (95% CI: 
1.77, 4.00); p<0.001]. 
For the key secondary endpoint of time to first nasal surgery up to Week 52, there was a clinically and 
statistically significant 57% reduction for the mepolizumab treated group compared to placebo in the 
risk of having surgery (hazard ratio: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.76, p=0.003).

Treatment with mepolizumab resulted in clinically significant improvements in overall VAS score 
(p<0.001), composite VAS score (p<0.001), and loss of sense of smell VAS score (p<0.001) compared 
to placebo. 
HRQoL showed improvements in HRQoL (in excess of the MIC of ≥28), as determined by SNOT-22, 
compared to placebo (p<0.001). 
There was a statistically significant 42% reduction compared to placebo in the odds of requiring 
systemic corticosteroid treatment (p=0.020). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is only a single pivotal trial supporting this extension of indication. 
Post-hoc supplementary analyses were carried out using a regression-based parametric mixed model 
repeated measures (MMRM) approach for the co-primary endpoints. This analyse provides an estimate 
of a treatment effect that assumes all patients completed treatment as planned and is consequently 
biased. However, the analysis showed similar results for the NPS score, a lower response rate was 
demonstrated for Nasal Obstruction VAS Score. For missing at random the LS mean difference was -
1.97 (-2.63, -1.31) p < 0.001, and with off treatment imputation the LS Mean difference was -1.86 (-
2.52, -1.19) p < 0.001. This would appear to be below the minimal important change limit of 3.0. 
It is not known whether the effects of treatment over a more prolonged duration of years would be 
maintained as demonstrated at week 52, however this will be followed up in the post marketing 
setting. 
Nucala is intended for long-term treatment. Consideration can be given to alternative treatments in 
patients who have shown no response after 24 weeks of treatment for CRSwNP. Some patients with 
initial partial response may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 24 weeks. This is 
reflected in section 4.2. of the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety assessment of mepolizumab in patients with CRSwNP (chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal 
polyposis) was mainly focused on 2 completed placebo-controlled studies, concretely Study 205687 
(phase III) and Study MPP111782 (phase II). Within Study 205687 (phase III), a total of 206 adult 
patients were treated with mepolizumab 100 mg SC and within Study MPP111782 (phase II), a total of 
53 adult patients were treated with mepolizumab 750 mg IV. 
Overall, for both studies, there were 35 drug-related AEs (14%) in the mepolizumab group and 
22 drug-related AEs (9%) in the placebo group. The most frequently reported on-treatment AEs were 
nasopharyngitis and headache in both groups. 
From clinical trial data in patients with nasal polyps, mepolizumab has an acceptable safety profile. 
Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity. The overall rates for AEs and SAEs were similar across 
treatment arms. Headache was the most common adverse reaction with a frequency of very common. 
No new ADRs were added in the existing tabulated list of ADRs of the section 4.8 of SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
While the safety analysis of the current clinical development programme appears to demonstrate that 
the safety profile is consistent with what is already known about mepolizumab, the long-term safety

profile in adult patients with nasal polyps will be fully characterised in the post-marketing setting 
though routine pharmacovigilance.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The MAH has demonstrated the beneficial treatment effects of Nucala add-on therapy to intranasal 
corticosteroids in patients with CRSwNP.  
In the pivotal studies, statistical significance was reached for the 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints 
(change from baseline in total endoscopic NPS and change from baseline in VAS NC score at Week 52) 
and all multiplicity adjusted key secondary endpoints demonstrated beneficial effect with Nucala 
treatment on top of intranasal corticosteroid compared to intranasal corticosteroid alone. 
The safety profile is similar to the current known safety profile and therefore acceptable. The 
immunogenicity effects were low and also in line with the known profile of this product. Nucala is not 
significantly associated with a higher risk of experiencing systemic hypersensitivity reactions in the 
CRSwNP population. 
3.7.2.   Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall benefit-risk is considered positive as an add-on treatment for patients with severe 
CRSwNP. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nucala is positive.

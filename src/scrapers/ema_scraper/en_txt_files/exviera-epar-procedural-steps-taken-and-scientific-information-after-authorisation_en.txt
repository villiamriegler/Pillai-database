The study (M12-999, CORAL-I) was designed to examine 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC of Viekirax and 
Exviera in order to update the efficacy and safety 
information based on study M12-999 listed as a 
category 3 study in the RMP. This is  an open-label, 
phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
the combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 
with or without dasabuvir and with or without 
ribavirin (RBV) in adult liver or renal transplant 
recipients with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) GT1 or GT4 
infection (CORAL I).

of studies to the competent authority 
the safety and efficacy of treatment with 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with dasabuvir (with or 
without ribavirin) in adult liver transplant recipients or renal 
transplant recipients.  
The primary objectives of this study were to assess safety 
and efficacy (the percentage of subjects achieving a 12-
week sustained virologic response, SVR12 [HCV RNA < 
lower limit of quantification {LLOQ} 12 weeks following 
treatment]) of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and 
dasabuvir and with or without ribavirin in HCV GT1-infected 
adult liver or renal transplant recipients and 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin in HCV GT4-
infected adult liver transplant recipients. 
Overall, the SVR12 rates were fully in line what has been 
described for non-transplanted HCV patients.  
The adverse events presented are overall consistent with 
the known safety profile of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 
and dasabuvir when used with ribavirin. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated to include 
information of the final study report of study CORAL I.

load at study start which support that earlier treatment had 
failed. One subject in Part 1 experienced relapse by post-
treatment week 12. One subject in Part 2 was identified 
with on-treatment virologic failure.  
Sustained virologic response at week 12 (SVR12) was 
achieved in 21/22 (95.5%) of the subjects included in Part 
1 and in 6/7 (85.7%) of the subjects included in Part 2. No 
subject who achieved SVR12 relapsed through the 48 
weeks follow-up, which suggests that efficacy is 
comparable with previous clinical results associated with 
this treatment regimen 
No baseline or treatment-emergent substitutions were 
identified in NS5A or NS5B at signature amino acid 
positions except for the subject in Part 2 who experienced 
on-treatment virologic failure where treatment-emergent 
substitutions were observed in NS3 and NS5B at the time 
of failure. Except from that case, baseline polymorphism in 
NS3, NS5A or NS5B was not associated with impaired 
treatment results. 
Adverse events reported in this study were generally 
consistent with the established safety profile for 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir, and for 
ribavirin (RBV) and the combination of these DAAs with 
RBV in previous studies of HCV subjects with and without 
cirrhosis. No subject experienced a treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAE) that met the criteria for severe 
cutaneous reactions or hepatic decompensation. One 
subject included in Part 1 discontinued the study drugs due 
to pneumonia and one subject in Part 2 experienced 
impaired glucose tolerance. No clinically relevant results of 
urinalysis, vital signs, or ECGs were observed. No deaths 
were reported.

associated substitutions in NS3 declined over time, while 
most substitutions in NS5A persisted through PT Week 96. 
Due to the limited data, no conclusions can be made on the 
persistence of treatment-emergent substitutions in NS5B.

in subjects with severe renal impairment was similar to that

subjects required intervention due to ribavirin-associated 
decreases in serum haemoglobin. The mean baseline 
haemoglobin level was 12.1 g/dL and the mean decline in 
haemoglobin at the end of treatment for subjects taking 
ribavirin was 1.2 g/dL. Thirty-nine of the 50 subjects who 
received ribavirin required interruption of ribavirin, and 11

Four subjects experienced a haemoglobin level < 8 g/dL.  
Two subjects received a blood transfusion.  Adverse events 
of anaemia were not seen in the 18 GT1b-infected subjects

response rates (SVR12) of >97%. A 12 Week 3-DAA 
regimen in GT1b infected patients was also highly effective 
(SVR12 97.6%) and had a superior safety profile. 
Based on the totality of the efficacy and safety data in 
Studies M13-774 and M13-862, no changes to the 
information in the Summary of Product Characteristics for 
Viekirax and Exviera are considered necessary.

recommended doses and monitoring strategies can be

Tacrolimus or sirolimus whole blood concentrations should 
be monitored upon initiation and throughout 
coadministration with dasabuvir and

and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir without ribavirin 
yielded excellent efficacy in subjects without cirrhosis, and 
with compensated cirrhosis. 
Page 19/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety profile of Viekirax and dasabuvir or Exviera and 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir were similar in subjects 
without cirrhosis, and with compensated cirrhosis with the 
exception of increased rates of transient hyperbilirubinemia 
when ribavirin was part of the regimen. 
In subjects receiving Viekirax and dasabuvir or Exviera and 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir without ribavirin, adverse 
events typically associated to ribavirin were less frequent 
and no subjects permanently discontinued treatment due to 
adverse reactions. 
Extreme caution must be taken to avoid pregnancy in 
female patients and female partners of male patients when 
Viekirax/exviera is taken in combination with ribavirin; 
refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for 
ribavirin for additional information. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in

treatment of patients with GT1b HCV infection

only Viekirax and Exviera as result of analysis of

updated based on an EMA request during procedure 
MEA/H/C/WS/808 in order to bring the statement on 
contraceptive use with ribavirin into line with that for 
other ribavirin products. The Package Leaflet is

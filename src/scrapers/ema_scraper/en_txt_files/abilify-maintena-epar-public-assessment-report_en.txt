2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This  is  a  complete,  Article  8(3)  application  for  Abilify  Maintena  (aripiprazole)  for  a  known  active 
substance through the centralised procedure. The product is intended for prescription only. 
Aripiprazole is a novel antipsychotic.  This active substance is already authorised for the treatment of 
schizophrenia in the European Union (EU) as tablets (5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg), orodispersible 
tablets  (ODT)  (10  mg,  15  mg  and  30  mg),  Oral  Solution  (1  mg/mL),  intramuscular  (IM)  Solution  for 
Injection,  7.5  mg/mL  (rapid  formulation).  The  efficacy  of  this  atypical  antipsychotic  has  been 
hypothesized  to  be  mediated  through  a  combination  of  partial  agonism  (agonism/antagonism)  at 
dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors as well as antagonism at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.

The claimed indication for Abilify Maintena is maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults. 
Schizophrenia 
is  a  chronic,  disabling,  and  progressive  disease  characterized  by  delusions, 
hallucinations,  and  cognitive  impairment;  symptoms  and  disease  course  differ  across  patients.  
Lifetime  prevalence  may  vary  across  countries  but,  overall,  adult  schizophrenia  affects  0.8  to  1%  of 
the general population1. The course of schizophrenia is typically characterized by episodes of psychotic 
behaviours occurring at varying intervals between periods of relative symptomatic stability.  Following 
each relapse, it is unlikely that patients will return to baseline functioning2. The 1-year relapse rate in 
schizophrenia, defined as worsening of psychopathological symptoms or rehospitalisation, is as high as 
40%  to  50%,  and  the  5-year  relapse  rate  after  a  first  episode  is  80% 3 .  Prevention  of  future 
exacerbations is a crucial goal of therapy and patients who stay on continual treatment are more likely 
to achieve optimal outcomes4. 
Non-adherence  to  treatment  has  been  identified  as  a  major  risk  factor  for  relapse  in  schizophrenia; 
even  brief  periods  of  non-adherence  can  lead  to  an  increased  risk  of  hospitalization  and  this  risk 
increases further with worsening adherence5. Non adherence to treatment, ie, patients not taking their 
medication  as  prescribed,  is  high  among  patients  with  schizophrenia  and  it  is  estimated  that 
approximately  50%  of  patients  miss  taking  30%  or  more  of  their  medications  for  schizophrenia 6.  A 
majority of patients with schizophrenia have poor insight into the fact that they have a psychotic illness 
and  this  predisposes  the  individual  to  non-adherence  with  treatment  and  has  been  found  to  be 
predictive  of  higher  relapse  rates,  increased  number  of  involuntary  hospital  admissions,  poorer 
psychological functioning, and a poorer course of illness7. Furthermore, poor insight into the illness and 
its  consequences  is  thought  to  be  one  of  the  most  important  contributors  to  non-adherence 8 .  In 
addition,  side  effects  of  the  current  medications  approved  for  schizophrenia,  such  as  extrapyramidal 
symptoms, weight gain, and cognitive impairment, also contribute to non-adherence9.

Long-acting  intramuscular  depot  medications  relieve  patients  from  the  daily  need  to  take  medication 
and  thus  have  the  potential  to  improve  outcomes  in  the  long  term  due  to  improved  adherence 10. 
Furthermore,  regular  interactions  with  the  health  care  provider  for  injection  visits  can  promote 
adherence,  as  failure  to  attend  an  injection  visit  serves  as  a  signal  for  treatment  non  adherence 11. 
Limited  data  comparing  oral  and  depot  formulations  suggest  that  depot  formulations  may  have  an 
advantage over oral antipsychotics for relapse prevention and rates of hospitalization. After a year or 
more of treatment, the relapse rate in outpatients with schizophrenia treated with depot antipsychotics 
was significantly lower than in those treated with oral antipsychotics12. 
Currently  there  are  two  depot  products  approved  under  a  centralised  procedure:  Zypadhera 
(olanzapine depot) and Xeplion (paliperidone depot) which have been authorized for the maintenance 
treatment of schizophrenia. 
The present submission is for IM aripiprazole depot product which is a sterile, single-dose, lyophilized 
powder for prolonged-release injectable suspension, indented to deliver 300 mg of aripiprazole in 300-
mg/vial strength and 400 mg of aripiprazole in 400-mg/vial strength.  The drug product is for gluteal 
injection.  At  the  initial  submission,  the  proposed  starting  and  maintenance  dose  of  aripiprazole  IM 
depot was 400 mg (2.0 mL) administered monthly by a healthcare professional as a single injection in 
the  gluteal  muscle.  However,  some  patients  may  benefit  from  a  lower  maintenance  dose  of  300  mg 
(1.5  mL)  based  on  individual  patient  tolerability.  The  first  dose  should  be  accompanied  by  14 
consecutive  days  of  concurrent  treatment  with  10  mg  to  20  mg  of  oral  aripiprazole  (or  current  oral 
antipsychotic). During the evaluation,the applicant followed the CHMP recommendation to change the 
indication  to  the  following:  “maintenance  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adult  patients  stabilized  with 
oral  aripiprazole”.  The  posology  was  consequently  amended  to  remove  the  reference  to  concomitant 
treatment with current other antipsychotic. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Abilify Maintena is presented as powder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection. 
Two strengths have been developed; 300 mg and 400 mg. The powder vial contains a sterile 
lyophilized cake, which is to be reconstituted with 1.5 or 1.9 ml water for injections from the solvent 
vial, to obtain an extended-release injectable (IM) suspension, containing 200mg/mlaripiprazole (as 
monohydrate) as active substance. Abilify Maintena is available in two pack sizes. The package 
contains powder and solvent vials, syringes, a vial adapter, and needles necessary for the 
reconstitution and administration.

The powder vial contains the following excipients: carmellose sodium, mannitol, sodium dihydrogen 
phosphate monohydrate, and sodium hydroxide. The solvent vial contains water for injections. The list 
of excipients is described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Aripiprazole monohydrate is a white to off-white crystal. It is not hygroscopic, and is very soluble in 
acetic acid, freely soluble in benzyl alcohol and tetrahydrofuran, soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide, slightly 
soluble in ethanol and acetonitrile, and insoluble in methanol. It is practically insoluble in water and 
shows a profile characteristic of basic organic compound. The solubility increases with a decrease of 
pH. The chemical name is 7-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butoxy]-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, 
as monohydrate (1:1). 
Aripiprazole monohydrate has the following structural formula: 
Aripiprazole exists in several crystalline forms. The monohydrate is the most stable crystal form in 
water. Aripiprazole has no asymmetric centres and is not optically active. There is no Ph.Eur. 
monograph for aripiprazole.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. The chemical structure of aripiprazole monohydrate is 
confirmed by elemental analysis, spectral analysis (UV, IR, NMR, MS), single crystal X-ray analysis and 
thermal analyses (DTA and TGA). The monohydrate form is confirmed by single crystal structure 
analysis. 
Manufacture 
Sterile aripiprazole monohydrate active substance is obtained from two suppliers. One of the suppliers 
has provided the information on the active substance in the form of an active substance master file 
(ASMF).  
Sterile aripiprazole monohydrate is manufactured aseptically by recrystallization of aripiprazole. 
Aripiprazole anhydrous is the active substance of Abilify, a medicinal product from the same applicant. 
The sterile crystallization is a one step process with no intermediates involved. The manufacturing of 
sterile aripiprazole monohydrate includes: i) synthesis of aripiprazole followed by ii) dissolution, iii) 
sterilization by filtration, iv) aseptic recrystallisation, v) aseptic drying and vi) aseptic packaging. Since 
this is an aseptic process, the only in-process control that is performed is the bioburden test before 
sterilisation by filtration, which is acceptable. No reprocessing is proposed. The manufacturing process 
is well described and the use of sterilisation by filtration instead of by heat has been adequately 
justified (see also the section on pharmaceutical development). Impurity profiles before and after the 
sterile crystallization show that no new drug-related impurities are generated by the recrystallization 
process.The manufacturing process has been appropriately validated.

(USP), residue on ignition (USP), bacterial endotoxins(USP/Ph.Eur.) and sterility (USP/Ph.Eur.).   
The critical quality attributes for sterile aripiprazole monohydrate are crystalline form and sterility, 
which are adequately controlled by the manufacturing process and specifications. Batch analysis data 
for 21 representative batches of sterile aripiprazole monohydrate drug substance used in pre-clinical, 
clinical, and stability studies, were presented by the applicant. Batch analysis data cover both suppliers 
and demonstrate that all batches comply with the proposed specifications and that the active 
substance can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Stability 
The  ICH  formal  stability  studies  were  performed  on  three  commercial-scale  batches  of  sterile 
aripiprazole monohydrate active substance, manufactured at both active substance manufacturers and 
packaged  in the  proposed  commercial primary  packaging  and  closure  system.  The  long-term  stability 
study  samples  were  stored  at  30°C/65%  RH  and  the  accelerated  storage  conditions  were  40°C/75% 
RH.  Up  to  36  months  long-term  data  and  up  to  6  months  accelerated  stability  data  have  been 
provided. Stress stability studies were carried out on one batch. The samples were tested at 25°C/90% 
RH (open dish), 40°C/75% RH (open dish), 50°C, and under white fluorescent/near ultraviolet lamps. 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  description,  identification  (IR  and  XRPD),  impurities  (HPLC), 
water  content  (KF),  assay  (HPLC),  sterility,  and  bacterial  endotoxins.  The  analytical  methods  used 
were adequate for stability determination of the substance. 
The results of a photostability study indicate that the drug substance is stable to light. The data from 
the open-dish studies and an elevated temperature study (50°C) demonstrate the stability of the drug 
substance to heat and humidity. The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by 
the proposed suppliers is stable and justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim was to develop a prolonged-release formulation for intramuscular injection that prevents the 
relapse of schizophrenia by maintaining the effect for 4 weeks after one single injection. Because an 
administration volume of not more than 2 ml is preferable for intramuscular injections, the 
concentration of the formulation to be developed was defined as 200 mg/ml. To keep irritation at the 
administration site acceptable and to reduce pain on administration, it is important that the finished 
product can be injected with a 21G or thinner needle. 
Aripiprazole monohydrate is very poorly soluble in water in the physiological pH range, and thus, the 
absorption rate of aripiprazole from the intramuscular injection site is dependent on the dissolution 
rate of the suspended crystalline particles of aripiprazole monohydrate. The dissolution rate is 
considered to be mainly influenced by the mean particle size and crystalline form. During the 
development, the influence of the crystalline form on the pharmacokinetic profile in rats was studied.

Page 11/70 
 
  
 
 
 
In view of the importance of the crystalline form and particle size for the absorption rate, the applicant 
developed an appropriate dissolution method, which was able to detect any differences in the particle 
size distribution (mean particle size) and different crystalline forms, which may vary during the 
manufacturing process and influence the in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles of the formulation in animals. 
The dissolution test method was demonstrated to be reproducible and is routinely carried out during 
the drug product release testing. 
The excipients in Abilify Maintena are commonly used in injectable dosage forms and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur standards. The compatibility of the drug substance and the excipients has been 
studied. The excipients in the powder vial are: carmellose sodium (suspending agent), mannitol 
(bulking agent), sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate (buffering agent), sodium hydroxide (pH 
adjustment agent), and nitrogen. For sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate adequate in-house 
specifications have been proposed. The solvent vial contains only water for injections (vehicle for 
reconstitution). There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients can be found in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The pharmaceutical development focussed on i) selecting a delivery system, ii) selecting the 
appropriate suspension, and iii) controlling the mean particle size and crystal form. 
Based on in vivo drug release studies in rats and local tolerance studies in rabbits, a flocculated 
suspension was chosen as the starting point for further development because it was shown to be the 
most promising in meeting the initial target product profile. However, a deflocculated suspension 
showed lower irritation at the administration site compared with the flocculated suspension.  
Because particle sedimentation occurred when the deflocculated suspension was stored for a long time, 
resulting in a difficult re-dispersion, it was decided to select, as the final drug product, a homogenised, 
deflocculated lyophilised formulation, which has to be reconstituted with sterile water for injections 
immediately prior to injection. The applicant demonstrated that the resulting suspension is easy to 
reconstitute, is homogeneous, has no aggregated masses (coarse particles), and exhibits excellent 
syringeability. The same formulation has been used throughout the clinical trials.  
The manufacturing process development focused on finding an appropriate way to obtain a sterile 
medicinal product. Studies demonstrated that the drug substance is not suitable for terminal 
sterilization. Aripiprazole monohydrate is discoloured and slightly decomposed by both gamma-ray and 
electron beam, and is melted by dry heat sterilisation. Aripiprazole monohydrate particles in aqueous 
suspension tend to agglomerate by steam heat sterilisation. Based on these findings, aseptic 
processing, instead of terminal sterilisation, had to be employed for the manufacturing process of 
Abilify Maintena. The manufacturing process of the commercial product is the same as the one used for 
the batches in the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Abilify Maintena is presented as a carton box containing one vial each for powder and solvent, a sterile 
syringe with pre-attached needle for reconstitution, a sterile syringe for administration, two 
hypodermic safety needles, and a vial adapter. The powder and solvent vials are Type-I glass vials, 
which are closed with a laminated rubber stopper, and sealed with a flip-off aluminium cap. This type 
of container closure system is commonly used for injectable dosage forms and is adequate to support 
the stability and use of the product. All materials comply with applicable European regulations, and 
declarations of EC conformity have been provided for the syringes, needles, and the vial adapter.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of animal or human origin have been used.

Manufacture of the product 
Abilify Maintena is a lyophilised product, produced by aseptic processing. The process is considered to 
be a non-standard manufacturing process.  
The manufacturing process of the powder vials consists of the following steps: i) sterile filtration of the 
vehicle solution, ii) addition of the sterile drug substance aseptically, iii) milling and filtration to obtain 
the desired particle size, iv) filling the suspension into depyrogenated vials and partially stoppering the 
filled vials, v) lyophilisation, and subsequently vi) stoppering and capping with steam sterilised 
aluminum caps.  
The vehicle solution is the solution in which the following excipients are dissolved during the drug 
product manufacturing process: carmellose sodium, mannitol, sodium dihydrogen phosphate 
monohydrate, and sodium hydroxide and water for injections. Because the viscosity of carmellose 
sodium is known to be irreversibly affected at high temperatures when in aqueous solution, sterile 
filtration was selected for the sterilization method of vehicle solution instead of heat sterilisation.. 
Although the EU GMP guideline recommends the use of heat sterilization, the use of sterile filtration 
was accepted for the reasons described above. 
In-process overfill is in place to compensate for loss of aripiprazole monohydrate due to adhesion of 
the drug substance to the filling lines. Overfill is also needed to compensate for the fact that after 
reconstitution some suspension cannot be withdrawn from the vial due to adhesion to the vial wall. The 
critical manufacturing steps (milling and lyophilisation), critical process parameters and control 
strategy have been adequately described and justified.  
The manufacturing process of the solvent vials consists of: i) washing, drying, sterilising, and 
depyrogenation of the vials, ii) filtration of the water for injections, iii) filling, and iv) stoppering. Water 
for injections is generated from highly purified water by distillation. Highly purified water is generated 
from potable water by reverse osmosis coupled with filtration and deionization. The quality complies 
with the Ph.Eur. and US Pharmacopoeia (USP) monographs. The details of the manufacturing process, 
flow diagrams and in-process controls are provided. There are no critical steps in the manufacture of 
the sterile water for injections vials. 
The manufacturing process has been fully validated for three batches of each strength of the powder 
vials and three batches of the solvent vials. The validation results demonstrate that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.   
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications of the powder vial include appropriate tests for description, 
identity (HPLC-PDA and XRPD (Ph.Eur.)), bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur.), sterility (Ph.Eur.), content 
uniformity (Ph.Eur.), pH (Ph.Eur.), water content (Ph.Eur.), syringeability, dissolution (Ph.Eur.), 
polymorphs (XRPD (Ph.Eur.)), particle size distribution (laser light diffraction, Ph.Eur.), aggregates 
(particle image analyzer), impurities/degradation products (HPLC) and assay (HPLC). 
The release specifications of sterilised water for injections are as in the monograph of the Ph.Eur. 
Batch analysis data have been provided for six production scale batches of both strengths of the 
powder vials and for three validation batches of the water for injections vials. The data confirm the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture the finished product with the 
intended product specification.

Stability of the product 
The stability studies were carried out on twelve production-scale batches, i.e. on six batches of each 
strength. Up to 24 months data have been presented for batches stored at 5ºC, 25ºC/60%RH and 
30ºC/75%RH and up to 6 months data are available for batches stored at 40ºC/75%RH. The batches 
were packed into the packaging materials, which are intended for marketing. 
The stability samples have been tested for: description, identification (by HPLC-PDA and XRPD), 
bacterial endotoxin, sterility, content uniformity, pH, water content, particulate matter, syringeability, 
dissolution, limit test for polymorph  particle size distribution, aggregates (by particle image analyzer), 
impurities/degradation products and assay.  
The absence of stability studies on powder samples stored in the inverted position has been justified 
based on the fact that the solid cake does not come into contact with the stopper when placed in 
inverted position. Additional tests that have been performed are: checking the maximum injection 
force, suspension viscosity, amorphous limit test (by thermal analysis and XRPD), anhydrous 
crystalline form (by NMR), crystalline form (by XRPD), osmolarity ratio, seal integrity test, insoluble 
foreign matter, dissolution and pressure in container.  
Stress stability studies have been performed on one commercial-scale batch of each strength of the 
powder vials. The studies were performed under the following conditions: 3 months at 50ºC, exposure 
to fluorescent light and UV for 600 hours and freeze-thaw cycling (-20ºC to 40ºC/ Day) for 2 weeks. In 
addition, a low humidity study (at 40ºC/20%RH) has been performed on one commercial-scale batch 
of each strength of the powder vials and an in-use stability study was conducted on the reconstituted 
suspension. Information on the in-use stability has been included in section 6.3 of the SmPC.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture, and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were no unresolved quality issues having an impact on the 
benefit/risk ratio of the product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  non  clinical  data  mainly  consisted  of  studies  previously  conducted  with  aripiprazole  as  oral  or  IM 
rapid  solution  for  injection  and  used  in  support  of  the  granted  marketing  authorisation  for  these 
formulations (Abilify).  Furthermore,  specific  studies were  performed  with  the  IM  aripiprazole  depot  to 
further  characterise  the  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  profiles  of  the  formulation  applied  for  and 
are presented in this application. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No  specific  pharmacology  studies  in  animal  models  for  IM  aripiprazole  depot  have  been  conducted 
taking into account existing pharmacological data for oral aripiprazole and its metabolites. 
The pharmacological properties of aripiprazole are mediated through a combination of partial agonism 
at  dopamine  D2  and  serotonin  5-HT1A  receptors  and  antagonism  at  serotonin  5-HT2A  receptors  as 
described below.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Aripiprazole  (OPC-14597,  OPC-31,  BMS-337039)  binds  with  high  affinity  to  dopamine  D2  and  D3, 
serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, with moderate affinity to dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-
HT7,  α1-adrenergic,  histamine  H1  receptors  and  the  serotonin  reuptake  site.  Aripiprazole  exhibits  low 
affinity for muscarinic receptors. 
Aripiprazole potently activates recombinant human D2 receptors which are coupled to the inhibition of 
cAMP  accumulation  achieving  a  maximal  effect  of  approximately  80%  of  that  produced  by  the 
endogenous agonist dopamine and in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells, it produces a dose-dependent 
inhibition of prolactin release with a maximal inhibitory effect of 70% of that displayed by dopamine. 
The affinity of aripiprazole for rat 5-HT2A receptors is lower than that of risperidone and chlorpromazine 
but  is  comparable  to  that  of  haloperidol  and  clozapine.  Additionally,  aripiprazole  inhibits  5-HT2A- 
mediated  behaviours,  suggesting  5-HT2A  antagonist  activity.  Aripiprazole  also  inhibits  gamma-
butyrolactone  and  reserpine-induced  increases  in  3,  4-dihydroxyphenylalanine  (DOPA)  accumulation 
consistent with a reduction in presynaptic tyrosine hydroxylase activity, and this effect was blocked by 
the  D2  receptor  antagonist  haloperidol  and  produces  a  hyperpolarization  of  ventral  tegmental  area 
dopamine neurons accompanied by a concomitant decrease in firing produced by activation of D2 auto-
receptors, an effect which was antagonized by the D2 receptor antagonist domperidone. 
Aripiprazole has cataleptogenic effects in rodents. In mice, the ratio of doses that are cataleptogenic to 
those  that  inhibit  apomorphine-induced  stereotyped  behaviour  was  about  11  times  that  of 
chlorpromazine  and  5  times  that  of  haloperidol.  In  rats,  the  dose  ratio  of  aripiprazole  was  about  14 
times  that  of  chlorpromazine  and  8  times  that  of  haloperidol.  Aripiprazole  was  4.8-  and  7.1-fold  less 
potent than olanzapine and risperidone, respectively in inducing catalepsy. 
In  electrophysiologic  studies,  the  effects  of  aripiprazole  on  neuronal  activity  in  nucleus  accumbens 
neurons, activated monosynaptically by stimulation of the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus, were 
examined.  Although  aripiprazole  alone  was  without  effect,  dopamine-,  SKF 38393-  and  quinpirole-
induced  inhibition  of  spike  generation  in  Acc  neurons  tended  to  be  antagonized  during  simultaneous 
application  of  aripiprazole.  Aripiprazole,  as  well  as  domperidone,  a  selective  D2  receptor  antagonist, 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 15/70 
 
  
 
 
 
show significant inhibition of striatal neuronal firing elicited by stimulation of dopaminergic inputs from 
the substantia nigra. Aripiprazole also blocks quinpirole-induced firing in striatal neurons, but does not 
alter  glutamate-induced  firing,  suggesting  that  aripiprazole  blocks  dopamine  D2  receptors  on  striatal 
cells receiving dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra. Aripiprazole produces a reduction in the 
firing rate of serotonin-containing dorsal raphe neurons in rats which is reversed by administration of 
the  selective  5-HT1A  antagonist  WAY-100635.  Additionally,  in  acutely  dissociated  hippocampal 
pyramidal  neurons  of  the  rat,  aripiprazole  (at  10-5M)  significantly  reduces  the  γ-aminobutyric  acid 
(GABA)-induced inward current but is less potent than the neuroleptic, zotepine. Aripiprazole does not 
influence the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced current. 
In  behaviorial  studies,  aripiprazole  showed  a  significant  inhibition  of  the  conditioned  avoidance 
response  comparable 
to  conventional  antipsychotics  (e.g.  haloperidol,  chlorpromazine)  and 
demonstrated anti-conflict behaviour in rats like the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Aripiprazole produced a dose-dependent reduction in body temperature in both mice (≥ 50 mg/kg/day) 
and rats (≥ 100 mg/kg/day).  Such hypothermic effects are consistent with the actions of serotonin 5-
HT1A  agonists,  including  partial  agonists  in  both  rodents  and  humans.  In  comparison,  haloperidol 
resulted in a slight reduction in body temperature of mice at an oral dose 30 mg/kg and reduced body 
temperature at oral doses 100 mg/kg or higher in rats. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Central and peripheral nervous systems 
Aripiprazole  was  less  potent  than  chlorpromazine  and  haloperidol  in  producing  behavioral  signs 
consistent with CNS depression, in inducing catalepsy, and in suppressing spontaneous motor activity 
and, unlike these comparators, did not cause convulsions. Additionally, it reduced motor coordination 
and  prolonged  the  duration  of  hexobarbital-induced  hypnosis  with  a  potency  comparable  to 
chlorpromazine.    In  contrast,  aripiprazole  demonstrated  less  potential  than  chlorpromazine  or 
haloperidol to induce muscular relaxation and analgesia. 
Cardiorespiratory system 
Aripiprazole  and  OPC-14857  inhibited  the  HERG/Ikr  current  only  at  very  high  multiples  of  the 
maximum steady-state plasma free-drug concentration and there were no effects on   action  potential 
duration  (APD)  in  the  rabbit  Purkinje  fiber  assay.  OPC-3373  demonstrated  no  in  vitro  inhibition  of 
HERG/Ikr current or prolongation of APD at concentrations up to 10 μM. Neither aripiprazole nor the 
main  human  metabolites (OPC-14857,  OPC-3373)  accumulate  in  rat  cardiac  tissue  following  single  or 
repeat  (13  days)  dosing.  Potential  cardiovascular  effects  were  also  assessed  in  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
safety  pharmacology  studies  (anesthetized  dogs)  and  in  toxicology  studies  (39  week  treatment  in 
monkeys)  where  no  significant  changes  were  observed.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  evidence  of  drug-
related  QTc  (Bazett's  correction) interval  prolongation  or  other clinically  significant ECG  abnormalities 
in over 2100 patients treated with aripiprazole. 
Other systems and tissues 
In vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the potential of aripiprazole 
to alter gastric secretion, gastrointestinal motility, smooth muscle contractility, and urine volume and 
electrolyte  excretion.    These  studies  indicated  that  aripiprazole  has  little  potential  to  cause 
gastrointestinal or renal side effects or affect smooth muscle contractility.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Co-administration  of  D2  receptor  antagonists  such  as  chlorpromazine  with  aripiprazole  reduce  the 
presynaptic dopamine (DA) autoreceptor agonist efficacy of aripiprazole. In contrast, lorazepam alone 
significantly  reduces  DOPA  accumulation  following  reserpine  injection  and  significantly  enhances 
aripiprazole's  action  as  a  presynaptic  DA  autoreceptor  agonist.  Fluoxetine  did  not  alter  aripiprazole's 
actions  on  presynaptic  DA  autoreceptors.  Co-administration  of  aripiprazole  with  other  agents  that 
produce  postsynaptic  D2  receptor  blockade  (haloperidol,  chlorpromazine,  risperidone)  act  in  an 
additive  manner  to  block  DA-mediated  behavior  and  induce  catalepsy.  Concomitant  administration  of 
aripiprazole  with  haloperidol  or  risperidone  produced  a  greater  increase  in  plasma  prolactin  levels  in 
rats than did aripiprazole alone. However, combined administration of aripiprazole with chlorpromazine 
did  not  produce  such  an  increase.  Concomitant  administration  of  aripiprazole  with  lorazepam 
decreased plasma prolactin levels. However, lorazepam alone significantly reduced prolactin levels. In 
contrast,  co-administration  of  aripiprazole  with  benztropine  or  fluoxetine  had  little  effect  on  plasma 
prolactin levels. Similar to the effects on DA-mediated behaviour, co-administration of aripiprazole with 
D2 receptor antagonists enhanced blockade of pituitary D2 receptors culminating in increased prolactin 
levels. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In addition to the existing pharmacokinetic data supporting the granted marketing authorisation (MA) 
for the oral and IM rapid aripiprazole (Abilify), the pharmacokinetic profile of IM aripiprazole depot and 
its metabolites was studied in rats. 
No  specific  studies  on  plasma  protein  binding  and  distribution  to  blood  cells  were  conducted,  nor 
excretion studies or studies on placenta transfer. Available studies are derived from oral aripiprazole or 
IM rapid aripiprazole.  
The pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole was dose linear and qualitatively similar in mice, dogs, monkeys, 
and humans; however, dose-dependent bioavailability was seen in rats likely due to saturation of the 
presystemic metabolism and/or elimination. The absolute oral bioavailability of aripiprazole was 47% in 
mice,  16%  at  10  mg/kg  in  rats,  6-12 %  in  dogs,  8%  in  monkeys,  and  87%  in  humans. In  bile  duct-
cannulated  rats,  aripiprazole  was  well  and  rapidly  absorbed  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract  and  about 
80% of drug-related material was recovered in the bile, suggesting that the low oral bioavailability in 
rats was due to extensive presystemic metabolism.  
The steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of aripiprazole in animals and humans was substantially 
greater  than  the  volume  of  total  body  water,  suggesting  extensive  extravascular  distribution  of  the 
drug and/or preferential binding to tissue proteins. Aripiprazole readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, 
as  there  is  rapid  uptake  and  extensive  distribution  of  aripiprazole  in  the  rat  brain  following  its  oral 
administration. Aripiprazole was extensively serum protein bound and the binding site was determined 
to be albumin site II specific. The ex vivo protein binding of aripiprazole was 99.75% and was similar 
to the protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis in vitro. 
Following  [14C]-aripiprazole  administration  to  pregnant  rats,  drug-related  radioactivity  was  widely 
distributed  in  maternal  tissues.  Distribution  of  radioactivity  to  the  fetus  was  low  and  only  a  trace 
amount of radioactivity was detected in the amniotic fluid even though concentrations of radioactivity 
in  the  placenta  were  1.3-4.5  times  higher  than  that  in  maternal  plasma.  Highest  fetal  tissues 
concentrations were observed in the fetal liver; lower concentrations were noted in fetal kidney, heart, 
blood,  lung,  and  brain.  Drug-derived  radioactivity  was  secreted  in  the  milk  within  0.5  h  after  oral 
administration  of  [14C]-aripiprazole  to  lactating  rats.  In  addition,  the  milk  vs.  blood  concentration 
ratios were greater than one for up to 24 h postdose. These results in rats suggest there is a potential 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 17/70 
  
 
 
 
for  fetal  and  neonatal  exposure  to  aripiprazole  if  administered  to  pregnant  or  lactating  women.  This 
information is included in section 4.6 of the SmPC.  
Following injection of aripiprazole IM depot formulation in rats, the Cmax and AUC of aripiprazole in the 
males increased with the dose increment.  Aripiprazole injected as a depot formulation remained at the 
injection  site  without  being  metabolized  or  decomposed  for  a long  time.  There  was  no  significant  sex 
difference observed in the blood concentration profiles in the rats administered at  3.75 mg/kg.  After 
14C-aripiprazole  IM  rapid  formulation  was  injected  to  male  rats  in  single  IM  administration  of  3.75 
mg/kg,  the  radioactive  concentrations  in  blood,  cerebrum,  cerebellum,  eyeball,  lung,  liver,  adrenal 
gland,  kidney,  muscle  and  plasma  were  the  highest  at  0.25  hours  after  the  administration  and 
decreased  thereafter.    At  168  hours,  the  radioactive  concentrations  in  harderian  gland,  sub-maxillary 
gland,  liver,  adrenal  gland  and  kidney  were  detected,  however,  the  radioactivity  in  the  other  tissues 
(blood, cerebrum, cerebellum, eyeball, lung, fat, muscle and plasma) was not detected.  The residual 
radioactivity  of  the  femoral  muscle  injected  with  the  test  article  at  0.25  hours  was  35.24%  of  dose.  
The  residual  radioactivity  in  the  injection  site  (muscle)  at  168  hours  was  0.68%  of  dose.    This  result 
showed  that  almost  all  dosed  radioactivity  from  the  femoral  muscle  injected  with  the  test  article  was 
eliminated by 168 hours.   
Aripiprazole  was  completely  bioavailable  following  IM  and  SC  administration.  No  new  metabolites  are 
formed  following  IM  administration  of  aripiprazole.  There  was  no  sex  difference  in  the  plasma 
concentrations of aripiprazole metabolites after dosing of aripiprazole IM depot formulation.  The rank 
order of the Cmax and AUCt for aripiprazole and its metabolites was aripiprazole > DM-1451 > OPC-
3373 > OPC-14857.   
After  14C-aripiprazole  IM  rapid  formulation  was  injected  to  both  male  and  female  rats  in  single  IM 
administration  of  3.75  mg/kg,  the  cumulative  urinary  and  fecal  excretion  rates  of  radioactivity  within 
168 hours after the administration were 4.88% and 92.05% in the male rats, and 6.57% and 91.09% 
in the female rats, respectively.   
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The  following  toxicology  studies  were  performed  with  IM  aripiprazole  depot:  1)  single  dose  toxicity 
studies  in  dogs,  2)  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  up  to  6  months  in  rats,  12  months  in  dogs,  and  4 
weeks in monkeys and 3) local tolerance studies in several species (rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys).   
Because  the  plasma  concentration  of  aripiprazole  after  IM  administration  in  humans  does  not  exceed 
those  after  oral  administration,  existing  data  for  oral  carcinogenicity  and  reproductive  toxicity  testing 
of  aripiprazole  as  described  below,  were  considered  sufficient  to  support  the  present  application.    In 
addition, the genotoxic potential of aripiprazole and its metabolites have been adequately evaluated in 
the  battery  of  genotoxicity  tests  previously  conducted  in  support  of  the  granted  marketing 
authorisation  of  the  oral and  IM  rapid  aripiprazole (Abilify)  and no  additional  studies  were  considered 
necessary. Available genotoxicity results are presented below.  
Single dose toxicity 
Following  single  IM  administration  of  aripiprazole  to  dogs  (doses  up  to  400  mg),  swelling  of  injection 
sites was noted on Days 1 to 4 at 100 mg in females and at doses of 200 and 400 mg  in males and 
females.  Microscopically,  a  dose-related,  minimal  to  moderate  granulomatous  inflammation  was 
observed.    The  inflammatory  response  was  characterized  by  the  presence  of  numerous  epithelioid 
macrophages  with  lesser  numbers  of  multinucleated  (foreign  body)  giant  cells  and  lymphocytes  that 
were localized primarily in the interstitial tissue of skeletal muscle.  The macrophages were associated 
with deposits of birefringent crystalline material, interpreted as test article, and represented a foreign

body reaction to deposited drug.  Injection site alterations were slightly diminished in size and severity 
on  Day  43  (study  termination)  compared  to  Day 29.  The  inflammation  and  deposited  drug  at  the 
injection sites decreased slightly over time, but did not completely resolve after 6 weeks.  There was 
no evidence of drug-related skeletal muscle injury or fibrosis/fibroplasia at the injection sites.  
Tremors were observed at all doses with decreased activity observed in males and females at ≥200 mg 
on the day of dosing but were not present the next day (Day 2).  These effects were considered related 
to  the  exaggerated  pharmacological  activity  of  aripiprazole.  Other  clinical  observations  included 
pain/discomfort  at  the  injection  site,  hind  limb  lameness/limping  (all  doses)  and  hind  limb  muscle 
fasciculations in 1 male at 300 mg and 1 female at 400 mg. Lameness/limping occurred on the day of 
dosing  and  resolved  by  Day  2.    Muscle  fasciculations  were  noted  on  Day  2  and  resolved  by  Day 3. 
Drug-related changes consisted of increased white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts and fibrinogen 
levels in all treated male and female groups on Day 2.  Minimal decreases in serum potassium occurred 
in all treated male and female groups on Day 2. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Preliminary  data  in  rats  (50  or  100  mg/kg/day,  weekly  or  biweekly  injection)  and  dogs  (20  or  40 
mg/kg/day, weekly (1 or 2 injections) or biweekly injection) revealed injection site tissue reactions. At 
necropsy, white (discolored) foci were observed in the injection sites of all rats and dogs treated with 
the  aripiprazole  suspension.  In  dogs,  the  foci  were  characterized  microscopically  by  slight 
granulomatous  inflammation.  A  scab  in  the  injection  site  was  also  observed  for  only  2  days  following 
the  second  injection  in  one  dog  treated  biweekly  with  40  mg/kg/day.  In  monkeys,  following  2  week 
administration  of  once  daily injection  of  2,  4  or  7.5  mg/kg/day,  dose-related,  increased  incidences  of 
tremors and hypoactivity were observed in males and females with the onset generally occurring within 
1 to 2 hours post-dose and resolving by 8 to 24 hours post-dose.  At 7.5 mg/kg/day, increases were 
observed in reticulocyte counts and ALT levels in males and females and AST levels in females.  Also, 
urine pH was minimally increased in males. Red discoloration at the injection site was noted across all 
groups.  Microscopic findings at the injection sites included degeneration, necrosis and regeneration of 
the  muscle  and  sub-acute  inflammation,  hemorrhage,  edema,  and  fibroplasia/fibrosis  of  the  muscle 
and adjacent connective tissue.  Minimal hemorrhage at the injection site was seen in all groups and 
varied from minimal (2 and 4 mg/kg/day) to mild severity (7.5 mg/kg/day).  At the end of the 2-week 
post-dose period, all drug-related changes recovered with nearly complete reversibility of injection site 
changes.  
In  rats,  at  doses  of  25,  50,  or  100  mg/kg  administered  weekly  for  26  weeks,  body  weights  and  food 
consumption of high-dose rats were generally lower than controls during the study with the decrease 
observed more in males than females. During recovery, the body weights of male rats at the high dose 
remained lower than controls. Transient changes in body weights and food consumption were observed 
at 50 mg/kg. Subcutaneous nodules and swelling (raised area) at the injection sites in the animals at 
all  doses  of  aripiprazole  with  a  greater  incidence  of  these  signs  at  the  high  dose.  The  subcutaneous 
nodule and swelling were occasionally observed after injection, but resolved either between injections 
or  as  the  study  progressed.  At  necropsy,  development  of  the  mammary  gland  was  observed  in  the 
females  given  25 mg/kg  and  was  higher  at  the  end  of  the  dosing  period,  and  was  also  noted  in  the 
females  given  100  mg/kg  at  the  end  of  the  recovery  period.  The  morphological  changes  in  the 
reproductive  and  mammary  tissues  in  the  females  given  25 mg/kg  and  higher  and  atrophy  of  pars 
intermedia in the pituitary gland in the males and females given 25 mg/kg and higher were considered 
pharmacologically  mediated  and  a  consequence  of  D2  partial  agonistic  activity  of  aripiprazole. 
Decreased  liver  weights  in  the  males  and  decreased  adrenal  and  relative  uterine  weights  in  females

given  100  mg/kg/day  were  observed  at  the  end  of  the  dosing  phase.  Increased  spleen  weights  were 
observed in females treated with 100 mg/kg. 
In  dogs,  at  doses  of  10,  20,  or  40 mg  administered  weekly  for  26  weeks,  a  subcutaneous  nodule 
(raised area) at the injection site in the animals given 20 and 40 mg/kg was noted. This subcutaneous 
nodule  was  occasionally  observed  after  injection,  but  resolved  over  time.  For  all  treated  animals,  the 
white  foci  observed  at  the  injection  site  were  characterized  microscopically  by  slight  granulomatous 
inflammation at the end of the dosing and recovery periods in line with the observations made for the 
single-dose toxicity study. In another study using the same doses but of longer duration (52 weeks), 
no  drug-related  deaths  occurred  throughout  the  dosing  period  although  1  control  female  receiving 
physiological  saline  was  euthanized  at  Week  51  due  to  sudden  deterioration  associated  with  heart 
failure. Necrosis of muscle fibers was noted in one female given 40 mg/kg at the end of the 52-week 
dosing  period  and  was  limited  to  the  area  of  granulomatous  inflammation.  This  was  considered  a 
consequence  of  focal  ischemia  secondary  to  granulomatous  inflammation  since  interstitial  tissues 
including  vessels  in  the  necrotic  muscles  were  also  necrotic.  No  evidence  of  muscle  necrosis  at  the 
injection  site  was  observed  in  any  other  treated  animals.  Also,  no  other  drug-related  gross  or 
microscopic changes were noted in the treated dogs. At the end of the 26-week recovery period, there 
were no gross or histopathological changes at the injection site in any animals given 40 mg/kg. 
In  monkeys,  at  doses  of  2,  4,  or  7.5  mg/kg/day,  administered  as  daily  injection  for  4  weeks,  a 
dose-related  pharmacologically  mediated  decreased  activity  and  tremors  were  evident  at  all  doses  in 
line with the observation made for the single-dose toxicity study. Decreased food consumption, which 
was likely secondary to the pharmacologic activity of aripiprazole, occurred in all drug-treated animals 
except for 2 males at 2 mg/kg/day.  During the dosing phase, mean food consumption of males given 
2,  4,  or  7.5  mg/kg/day  was  about  24%,  63%,  and  51%  lower  than  control,  respectively.  
Corresponding  values  in  the  females  given  2,  4,  or  7.5  mg/kg/day  were  about  34%,  62%,  and  58% 
lower  than  control,  respectively.  Dehydration  and  a  thin  appearance  of  monkeys  in  the  4  and  7.5 
mg/kg/day groups also were observed and were considered related to the reduced food consumption. 
Dose-related  clinical  findings  at  the  injection  sites  included  an  increased  incidence  of  scabbing  at  all 
doses  and  red  discoloration  at  7.5  mg/kg/day.  Minimal  increases  in  serum  AST  levels  at  4  or  7.5 
mg/kg/day were attributed to minor skeletal muscle injury at injection sites. 
Genotoxicity 
Aripiprazole  demonstrated  genotoxic  potential  in  several  tests:  (1)  in  the  bacterial  reverse-mutation 
test  where  a  slight  concentration-dependent  increase  of  reverse  mutations  in  TA100  strain  in  the 
presence of S9 metabolic activation was noted, (2) in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test (CHL) 
at  30  µg/ml  and  above,  corresponding  to  highly  cytotoxic  concentration  and  suggesting  an  indirect 
clastogenic  effect,  and  (3)  in  the  oral  in  vivo  micronucleus  tests  in  mice  at  100  mg/kg  and  above, 
possibly  related  to  a  profound  drug-induced  hypothermia.  Aripiprazole  demonstrated  no  genotoxic 
potential in the bacterial DNA repair assay, forward gene mutation test in mouse lymphoma cells, and 
in vivo-in vitro unscheduled DNA repair assay in rat hepatocytes. Based on the weight of evidence from 
the battery of genotoxicity studies, aripiprazole is not considered to pose a genotoxic risk to humans at 
therapeutic doses and exposures. 
Carcinogenicity 
In mice, dietary administration of aripiprazole at doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks was 
associated  with 
increased 
incidences 
of  mammary 
tumors,  namely 
adenocarcinomas 
/adenoacanthomas  and  pituitary  adenomas  in  females  at  the  mid-  and  high  doses.  Gall  bladder 
adenoma  was  observed  in  both  sexes  at  the  two  highest  doses,  but  not  in  control  or  the  lower  dose

tested.  A  dose-related  increase  of  skin  schwannoma  or  malignant  schwannoma  as  well  as  spleen 
hemangioma 
or 
hemangiosarcoma  was 
also 
observed. 
The 
incidence 
of 
liver 
hemangioma/hemangiosarcoma and hepatoblastoma was increased in males (an effect not observed in 
females) comparatively to control for all tested doses. Increases in mammary and pituitary neoplasms 
as well as other drug-related mammary/reproductive tissue alterations in females were considered, by 
the applicant, likely to be secondary to aripiprazole-related increases in serum prolactin.  
In a supplementary study, dietary administration of aripiprazole at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day to mice for 
100  to  104  weeks  was  associated  with  increased  incidences  of  mammary  adenocarcinomas/ 
adenoacanthomas  and  pituitary  adenomas  in  female  mice.  Increases  in  mammary  and  pituitary 
neoplasms,  as  well  as  other  drug-related  mammary/reproductive  tissue  alterations  in  female  mice 
were  considered  to  be  secondary  to  aripiprazole-related  increases  in  serum  prolactin.  An  increased 
incidence of liver haemangioma or hemangiosarcoma was also observed.  
In rats, dietary administration of aripiprazole at doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day to F344 rats for 104 
weeks was associated with an increased incidence of mammary gland fibroadenoma (a benign tumor) 
in females at the high dose only. The mammary fibroadenomas and uterine atrophy were considered, 
by  the  applicant,  to  be  secondary  to  aripiprazole-related  increases  in  serum  prolactin.  There  was  no 
drug-related increased incidence of tumors in male rats. 
In order to reach a maximum tolerated dose, another oral carcinogenicity study was conducted using 
gavage administration to Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 10, 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks. 
In this study, there was an increased incidence of adrenocortical tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) 
at  60  mg/kg/day  in  females  only.  Drug-related  non-neoplastic  findings  at  40  and  60 mg/kg/day 
included  increased  incidences  and/or  severities  of  bilateral  retinal  degeneration  attributed  to  the 
greater lifetime exposure to light due to a higher survival rate in these groups. 
The highest doses tested in carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats resulted in exposures (AUC0-24 h) 
that  were  equivalent  (mice)  and  up  to  approximately  10  times  greater  than  (rats)  exposure  at  the 
maximum  recommended  dose  in  humans  (30 mg).  The  highest  non-tumorigenic  exposure  in  female 
rats was approximately 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.  
Additional clinical data after the granting of the MA for the oral formulation suggested that aripiprazole 
did  not  have  any  systematic  biochemical  effect  upon  the  adrenocortical  hormones.  These  data  were 
considered  reassuring  and  in  line  with  the  conclusion  that  the  tumours  observed  in  the  female  rats 
were species specific.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The  full  standard  battery  of  reproduction  toxicity  studies  was  conducted  in  rats  and  rabbits  with 
aripiprazole. 
The  following  findings  point  to  hazard  caused  by  aripiprazole  administration  during  reproduction:  (i) 
oral administration of aripiprazole to pregnant rats at doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day from days 7 to 17 
of  gestation  produced  evidence  of  maternal  toxicity  and  suppressed  fetal  growth  (decreased  body 
weight  and  retarded  ossification);  (ii)  in  the  study  of  embryo-fetal  development  in  rats,  fetal 
abnormalities  (with  low  incidence)  were  observed  at  the  dose  of  30  mg/kg  in  almost  all  types  of 
abnormalities  evaluated.  In  some  cases,  abnormalities  were  also  observed  at  3mg/kg.  Noteworthy,  it 
was observed a dose-dependent decrease in fetal ossification, which became statistically significant at 
30 mg/kg. Dose-related maternal toxicity and a slight delay in vaginal opening in F1 females occurred 
at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day. A maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day resulted in slight prolongation of gestation,

developmental  delay  of  F1  fetuses  and  pups,  and  minimally  decreased  reproductive  performance 
(fertility  index)  of  F1  rats;  (iii)  In  a  supplemental  embryo-fetal  development  study  in  rats,  decreased 
body weight on day 4 postpartum and a tendency for delayed vaginal opening and an increase in pre-
implantation  loss  occurred  at  30  mg/kg/day  in  F1  females;  (iv)  In  the  study  of  embryo-fetal 
development  in  rabbits,  fetal  body  weights  were  decreased  in  males  at  30  mg/kg/day  and  in  both 
sexes  at  100  mg/kg/day.  Other  drug-related  changes  at  100  mg/kg/day  included:  abortion  in  seven 
dams,  minimal  maternal  body  weight  loss  during  the  treatment  period,  increased  post-implantation 
loss, decreased placental weight, and increased incidences of common skeletal variations (20 thoraco-
lumbar vertebrae and extra 13th rib and fused sternebrae. 
NOELs for embryo-fetal and peri/postnatal development occurred at subtherapeutic or low multiples of 
the human steady-state exposures to aripiprazole and its active metabolite, OPC-14857.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data were collected from the toxicology studies specifically conducted with aripiprazole IM 
depot. 
Exposure  to  aripiprazole  with  IM  injection  was  prolonged  with  the  parent  compound  detected  at 
29 days  or  more  following  a  single  injection.    With  repeat  dosing,  systemic  levels  of  aripiprazole  and 
metabolites increased with dose and the increase was not generally dose proportional.  There were no 
remarkable  differences  between  genders.    No  new  metabolites  or  decomposition  products  of 
aripiprazole  were  formed  at  the  injection  site.  Exposure  profiles  of  aripiprazole  and  metabolites  vary 
across  the  different  non  clinical  species  (rats,  dogs  and  monkeys)  although  the  exposure  to 
aripiprazole  was  higher  than  those  for  the  metabolites.    There  was  no  dose  proportionality  across 
species.    With  extended  treatment  from  26  to  52 weeks  in  dogs,  there  were  minimal  differences  in 
Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole or metabolites.  The plasma levels, based on Cmax, of the metabolites 
OPC-14857  and  DM-1452  tended  to  be  greater  in  dogs  compared  to  rats,  and  OPC-14857  plasma 
levels tended to be higher in dogs than in monkeys.  In contrast, the plasma levels for DM-1451 was 
about  4-fold  higher  in  rats  compared  to  dogs.  Other  metabolites,  eg,  OPC-3373  and  DCPP  were 
generally similar between rats and dogs. 
Local Tolerance  
Seventeen  IM  injection  local  tolerance  studies  with  aripiprazole  were  conducted  in  rats,  rabbits,  dogs 
and monkeys.  Nine of the studies were exploratory and aimed to determine an appropriate vehicle for 
aripiprazole formulations that could be used in subsequent toxicity studies.  Results indicated a better 
tolerance  for  formulations  using  CMC,  HPC  or  15%  Captisol  as  vehicle.The  remaining  8  pivotal  local 
tolerance studies were conducted using formulation with CMC or 15% Captisol. 
In  rats,  after  a  single  dose  of  12.5,  25  or  50  mg/kg  (CMC  formulation),  a  dose-related  increased 
incidence  of  injection  site  swelling  was  observed  and  likely  represented  deposits  of  test  article  in  the 
muscle.    There  was  a  greater  incidence  in  males,  compared  to  females.  At  the  injection  sites,  white 
discolored foci were observed at necropsy on Days 29 and 45 at all doses although the size of the foci 
generally decreased over time but did not completely resolve by Day 45 (study termination).  The foci 
were characterized microscopically by a dose-related minimal to mild granulomatous inflammation and 
minimal  fibroplasia/fibrosis  on  Day  29.    The  localized  inflammatory  response  consisted  of  numerous 
epithelioid  macrophages  and  foreign  body  giant  cells  in  association  with  deposits  of  birefringent 
crystals  (interpreted  as  drug)  in  the  muscle  interstitium.    These  findings  were  considered  a  foreign 
body reaction to deposited drug.  By Day 45, partial resolution of the granulomatous inflammation and 
fibroplasia/fibrosis had occurred. In another rat study using a different CMC formulation and doses (75 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 22/70 
  
 
 
 
or  100  mg/kg  as  a  single  administration),  there  were  no  drug-related  injection  site  findings.  
Microscopically, the primary finding at the injection site was a localized, minimal to mild granulomatous 
inflammatory  response  to  deposited  drug  that  was  consistent  with  a  foreign-body  reaction.    This 
inflammation  was  not  completely  resolved  by  Day  45.    No  evidence  of  skeletal  muscle  injury  at  the 
injection sites was observed at either dose. After repeated dose of 1 or 3.75 mg/kg/day once daily for 
2 weeks using Captisol formulation, a dose-related increased incidence of discoloration and swelling at 
injection sites was observed during the dosing phase.  These findings resolved by Day 17 after 3 days 
of recovery.  At the end of the dosing phase, a statistically significant increase in the mean serum AST 
was  observed  in  females  at  the  high  dose.    No  effects  on  either  AST  or  CPK  levels  were  observed  in 
either gender at the end of the recovery phase. At necropsy, a minimally increased incidence of dark 
and/or  red  discoloration  of  injection  sites  was  present.    Microscopically  at  the  injection  sites, 
degeneration, necrosis, and regeneration of muscle and sub-acute inflammation, hemorrhage, edema, 
and  fibroplasia/fibrosis  of  muscle  and  surrounding  connective  tissue  occurred  at  a  generally  minimal 
severity  in  the  vehicle  and  1  mg/kg/day  groups  and  at  a  minimal  to  mild  severity  in  the  3.75 
mg/kg/day  group.    In  all  dose  groups,  the  fibroplasia  was  located  primarily  in  connective  tissue 
adjacent to the muscle, with lesser involvement of IM connective tissue in most animals.  During the 2-
week  post-dose  period,  there  was    nearly  complete  reversibility  of  injection  site  changes.    Only 
minimal, late stage muscle regeneration and fibroplasia/fibrosis were still present in vehicle control, 1 
and 3.75 mg/kg/day animals.   
In  rabbits,  after  single  doses  of  25,50  or  100  mg  (CMC  formulation)  and  at  necropsy,  white 
discoloration  at  the  injection  sites  (consistent  with  deposits  of  the  test  article  and  associated 
inflammation) was noted in all drug-treated animals at all timepoints.  The size of these discolored foci 
was  generally  dose  related,  and  there  was  a  reduction  in  size  over  time.    The  principal  microscopic 
finding  at  the  injection  site  was  generally  dose-related  and  was  observed  as  minimal  to  moderate 
granulomatous  inflammation  in  the  muscle  interstitium.    The  localized  granulomatous  inflammation 
was  characterized  by  the  presence  of  numerous  epithelioid  macrophages  and  lesser  numbers  of 
heterophils  and  lymphocytes  and  was  most  severe  at  Days  15  and  29,  with  incomplete  resolution  by 
Day 57.  The finding was considered to represent a foreign body reaction to deposited drug.  Additional 
drug-related microscopic findings included minimal to mild sub-acute inflammation through Day 15 in 
the 25 and 50 mg dose groups and through Day 57 in the 100 mg dose group, an increased incidence 
of minimal muscle degeneration/regeneration, and minimal or mild fibroplasia that generally resolved 
by  Day  57.    Birefringent  polymorphic  crystalline  material,  interpreted  as  deposited  drug,  remained  in 
areas  of  inflammation  through  Day  57  for  all  treated  groups.    In  another  rabbit  study  using  single 
doses of 100 or 200 mg (CMC formulation), mild edema at the injection site was noted in 1 rabbit on 
Day  2  and  persisted  to  Day 4  (day  of  necropsy).    At  necropsy,  white  and/or  red  discoloration  at  the 
injection site were seen in all treated animals at scheduled sacrifices on Days 4, 7, 15 and 29.  At the 
Day 57 necropsy, tan discoloration was noted at the injection site in the treated rabbits at both doses.  
These foci of white/tan discoloration at the injection sites were considered to be deposited test article, 
and the  deposits were generally comparable in size through Day 29 but were notably smaller on Day 
57.  Microscopic finding at the injection site at all timepoints included minimal to moderate (generally 
mild)  granulomatous  inflammation  as  a  foreign-body  reaction  in  response  to  deposited  drug 
(polymorphic, birefringent crystalline material).  The inflammatory reaction was most severe on Day 15 
but  declined  in  severity  through  Day  57.    Other  drug-related  findings  indicative  of  skeletal  muscle 
injury  included  minimal  degeneration  and  necrosis  (Days  4  and/or  7)  and  minimal  regeneration  (Day 
15).  Additionally,  mild  sub-acute  inflammation  was  observed  at  the  injection  sites  through  Day  15. 
After single dose of 2, 4 or 7.5 mg using Captisol formulation, very slight to slight injection site edema 
was  observed  across  all  groups  including  controls.    Increased  CPK  level  was  observed  for  all  groups, 
including  controls,  relative  to  pre-dose  values.  A  dose-related  increased  CPK  level  on  Day  2  was 
observed  compared  to  (saline)  controls  but  were  similar  across  all  groups  at  Day  18.    At  the  Day  4 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 23/70 
  
 
 
 
necropsy, focal tan areas associated with and/or surrounded by hemorrhage were observed at injection 
sites  of  some  animals  receiving  4  and  7.5  mg/mL.  Microscopically,  muscle  degeneration/regeneration 
and  inflammation  were  observed  on  Day  4  with  minimal  severity  in  the  saline  control  group  and 
minimal to mild severity in the vehicle control, 2, and 4 mg/mL groups and mild to moderate severity 
in  the  7.5 mg/mL  group.    Additionally,  minimal  to mild  hemorrhage  and  mineralization of  degenerate 
muscle  fibers  were  noted  in  vehicle-  and  drug-treated  groups.    By  Day  18,  minimal  muscle 
regeneration  and  mineralization  were  still  present  in  one  animal  at  2 mg/mL,  and  very  slight  edema 
and minimal muscle regeneration, inflammation, mineralization, and/or perimysial/endomysial fibrosis 
were apparent at 7.5 mg/mL. 
In dogs, single doses of 200,300 or 400 mg (CMC formulation) were administered as 2 injections. At 
300 and 400 mg doses, swelling and erythema were evident at the injection sites. At necropsy, white 
discoloration  (deposits  of  the  test  article)  was  apparent  at  the  injection  sites  of  all  dogs,  and  red 
discoloration of subcutaneous tissue (hemorrhage) and minimal or mild swelling were noted in dogs in 
the  300  and  400  mg  dose  groups.    Microscopically,  the  primary  tissue  response  to  deposited  drug 
(birefringent crystalline material) was mild sub-acute inflammation at the 200 mg dose with moderate 
to  marked  sub-acute  inflammation  in  dogs  given  the  higher  doses.    Other  microscopic  injection  site 
changes  observed  in  one  or  both  dogs  given  each  dose  volume  were  minimal  to  mild  in  severity  and 
included:  edema,  hemorrhage,  degeneration  of  skeletal  muscle,  granulomatous  inflammation,  and 
fibroplasia/fibrosis.  
In monkeys, after single doses of 50 or 100 mg, hypoactivity (1 female), acute injection site swelling 
or discoloration (female/male) were noted at highest dose tested. There was a drug related increase in 
AST (1.4-fold to 6.3-fold) and CPK  levels (3-fold to 18.7-fold) in both sexes on Day 2 post-dose, after 
50 mg (CMC) and 100 mg (saline) dose. On Days 4 and 7 post-dose, minimal changes in AST and CPK 
levels  were  observed.  At  necropsy,  white  discoloration,  apparent  test  article  deposits  in  muscle,  was 
noted  in  the  injection  sites  through  Day  29  for  both  concentrations.    The  white  foci  were  of  variable 
shape and size and did not decrease with time.  Microscopically, the principal finding was a minimal to 
mild  granulomatous  inflammatory  response  to  birefringent  crystalline  drug  deposits  that  was 
characterized by accumulation of macrophages with foamy cytoplasm and eosinophilic deposits of the 
test  article.    The  severity  of  the  microscopic  changes  tended  to  decrease  with  time,  but  complete 
resolution  of  the  inflammatory  process  did  not  occur  by  Day  29.    Minimal  focal  inflammation  and 
skeletal muscle regeneration was observed in the injections sites from CMC and saline administration 
as a consequence of needle damage from injection. 
Other toxicity studies 
No  other  toxicity  studies  were  specifically  performed  with  aripiprazole  IM  depot..  Available  studies 
derived from oral aripiprazole. 
Antigenicity: Aripiprazole was evaluated for its antigenic potential in groups of 10 male Hartley guinea 
pigs  sensitized  with  doses  of  0.5  or  5  mg/kg  of  aripiprazole in Freund’s  complete  adjuvant  (FCA).  No 
antigenic potential in guinea pigs was found. 
Immunotoxicity:  
In rats, no significant change in the T-cell dependent antibody response to sheep red blood cell antigen 
occurred  at  oral  doses  up  to  60  mg/kg/day  in  a  4  week  study,  indicating  the  humoral  response  was 
unaltered by treatment with aripiprazole. No clear drug-related morphologic changes in lymphoid and 
hematopoietic  tissues  of  rodents  and  monkeys  were  observed  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  of 
aripiprazole.    Minimal  bone  marrow  depletion  was  observed  in  rats  at  20  mg/kg/day  in  the  5-week 
screening study and at 60 and 100 mg/kg/day in the 4-week toxicity study.   
Dependence:  The  physical  dependence  and  abuse  potential  of  aripiprazole  were  evaluated  in  three 
pivotal studies: a primary physical dependence study in rats, a primary physical dependence study in

monkeys,  and  a  self-administration  substitution  test  in  monkeys.  The  obtained  results  suggest  that 
aripiprazole does not have significant abuse liability. 
Metabolites:  
A  single-dose  intravenous  toxicity  study  of  OPC-14857  in  rats  showed  at  50  and  100  mg/kg,  clinical 
signs of poor general condition partially reversible on day 2, with evidence of intravascular haemolysis. 
In the single-dose intravenous toxicity study of OPC-3373 in rats, there were no drug-related effects. A 
bacterial reverse-mutation test of DCPP was negative. 
Photo-safety: 
As aripiprazole binds to melanin-containing tissues (tissue distribution studies), in vitro (photostability, 
3T3 NRU PT) and in silico studies were performed and did not indicate a risk to patients.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No  pharmacological  studies  were  specifically  conducted  with  IM  aripiprazole  depot  in  animals  taking 
into  account  existing  pharmacological  data  for  oral  aripiprazole  and  its  metabolites  and  this  was 
considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  The  pharmacological  properties  of  aripiprazole  are  mediated 
through  a  combination  of  partial  agonism  at  dopamine  D2  and  serotonin  5-HT1A  receptors  and 
antagonism at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.  
The pharmacokinetic profile of aripiprazole has also already been characterised with oral and IM rapid 
aripiprazole  (crosses  the  blood  brain  barrier,  placenta  transfer,  >99%  plasma  protein  binding; 
excretion  into  faeces;  urine  and  notably  milk).  Aripiprazole  was  completely  bioavailable  following  IM 
and  SC  administration.  No  new  metabolites  were  formed  following  IM  administration.  Aripiprazole 
injected  as  a  depot  formulation  remained  at  the  injection  site  without  being  metabolised  or 
decomposed for a long time and was eliminated by approximately 168 hours.  At similar doses, higher 
exposure (determined by Cmax and AUC) were observed using the oral route as compared to the IM 
depot  injection  indicating  that  extrapolation  of  the  non  clinical  data  from  oral  aripiprazole  could  be 
made.  With  oral  aripiprazole,  repeat-dose  toxicity  in  rat  and  monkeys  revealed  mainly  CNS-related 
effects. The NOAEL were mostly below the resulting human exposure at therapeutic dose (30 mg/day). 
The  genotoxicity  battery  was  positive  in  some  tests,  but  at  very  high  and  cytotoxic  concentrations. 
Overall,  based  on  the  weight  of  evidence  from  the  whole  battery  of  genotoxicity  studies,  aripiprazole 
was not considered to pose a genotoxic risk to humans at therapeutic doses and exposures. The main 
finding in carcinogenicity was an increased incidence of adrenocortical tumors in rats. Additional clinical 
data  suggested  that  aripiprazole  did  not  have  any  systematic  effect  upon  adrenocortical  hormones, 
indicating  that  the  observed  tumours  in  female  rats  were  probably  species  specific.  Developmental 
toxicity,  including  dose-dependent  delayed  foetal  ossification  and  possible  teratogenic  effects,  were

observed  in  rats  at  doses  resulting  in  subtherapeutic  exposures  (based  on  AUC)  and  in  rabbits  at 
higher exposure.  
The toxicology studies conducted with the aripiprazole IM depot showed a toxicological profile generally 
similar to oral aripiprazole to the exception of local tissue responses to injection of the depot observed 
in  the  extensive  data  package  investigating  local  tolerance.  The  severity  of  the  tissue  reactions  was 
proportional  to  the  dose  volume,  the  drug  concentration  at  the  injection  site  and  the  frequency  of 
injections,  and  the  changes  were  fully  or  partially  reversible  following  cessation  of  administration. 
Gross  and  microscopic  evidence  of  injection  site  inflammation  at  all  doses  with  incomplete  recovery 
were  noted  in  every  studies  across  different  animal  species.  These  were  in  fact  the  principal  drug-
related  findings  in  the  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys  specifically  conducted  with  the  IM 
depot.  According  to  the  applicant,  the  vehicle  (Captisol)  may  have  contributed  to  some  extent  to  the 
local  tissue  responses  and  trauma  associated  with  the  injection,  with  a  slight  exacerbation  of  the 
injection  site  injury  related  to  aripiprazole.  Whilst  local  site  injection  reactions  are  further  discussed 
from a clinical perspective (see 2.6), a description of these findings (granulomatous inflammation, foci, 
cellular infiltrate, swelling, fibrosis) in section 5.3 was considered adequate by the CHMP. 
Based  on  estimated  sale  forecast  for  2015  for  aripiprazole,  no  additional  impact  to  the  environment 
was expected with the use of IM aripiprazole depot. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non clinical aspects of aripiprazole IM depot have been adequately documented and meet 
the requirements to support this application. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
A  routine  GCP  inspection  was  performed  at  one  investigator  site  for  study  31-07-247  and  two 
investigator  sites  for  study  31-07-246.  Overall,  three  major  findings  and  a  number  of  minor  findings 
were  reported  by  the  inspectors.  No  critical  findings  were  reported  at  any  site.  The  GCP  inspectors 
concluded  that  the  sites  inspected  appeared  to  be  GCP  compliant  and  therefore  recommend  the 
acceptance  of  the  data.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  GCP  findings  reported  did  not  impact  on  the 
study results and conclusions. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  Phase  I  clinical  pharmacology  program  (studies  CN138-020,  31-07-002  and  31-05-244,  31-11-
289) has been conducted in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. 
In  addition  to  these  phase  I  studies  specifically  conducted  with  IM  aripiprazole  depot,  a  population 
pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  performed  using  data  from  Phase  I  and  III  studies  (CN138020,  31-07-
246)  together  with  Phase  I  studies  from  the  clinical  development  of  oral  aripiprazole  (studies  31-98-
206,31-98-207).  An  external  validation  of  the  population  PK  model  was  obtained  from  this  analysis 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 27/70 
  
 
 
 
using  the  Phase  III  study  31-07-247  and  was  considered  adequate  by  the  CHMP.  Finally, 
pharmacokinetic characteristics derived from studies with oral (mainly) and IM rapid aripiprazole, were 
also considered. 
Plasma  concentration  of  aripiprazole  and  analysed  metabolites  (e.g  dehydro-aripiprazole)  was 
determined using high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection 
(HPLC-MS/MS)  method  in  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  studies.  Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were 
determined using non compartmental models. Population PK analyses were conducted using non linear 
mixed effects modeling methodology (NONMEM). 
Absorption  
Following a single IM dose of aripiprazole depot ranging from 15 to 400 mg, the plasma concentrations 
of aripiprazole gradually increase to reach maximum plasma concentrations within 7-24 days (167-577 
hours).  The  release  of  the  drug  starts  as  early  as  day  1  and  the  estimated  time  required  to  absorb 
50% of the dose ranged between 10 to 35 days across the tested dose range. The average absorption 
half life  of  IM  aripiprazole  depot  was 28  days.  After  IM  multiple  dosing,  the  plasma  concentrations  of 
aripiprazole  gradually  rise  and  at  steady  state  reach  maximum  plasma  concentrations  at  a  median 
Tmax  of  5-7  days.  Dehydro-aripiprazole,  the  active  metabolite,  represents  about  29.1-32.5  %  of 
aripiprazole  AUC  in  plasma.The  absorption  of  aripiprazole  from  the  IM  depot  formulation  was 
considered  complete  relative  to  the  IM  standard  (immediate-release) 
formulation.  Relative 
bioavailability of the IM aripiprazole depot compared with the IM rapid aripiprazole (5 mg) indicated a 
supra-bioavailability (based on AUC) ranging from 1.10 to 1.44 for all doses, except for the lower dose 
of 15 mg. The dose adjusted Cmax values for the IM aripiprazole depot were approximately 5% of the 
Cmax from the IM rapid aripiprazole. A direct comparison with IV aripiprazole has not been performed 
and was not considered necessary. 
Comparison of exposure with oral aripiprazole 
Simulation  of  median  aripiprazole  concentration  and  its  estimated  fifth  and  95th  percentiles  after 
administration of 400 mg IM aripiprazole depot at dose initiation and at steady-state and comparison 
to  that  of  10  and  30  mg  oral  aripiprazole  are  presented  in  Figure  1.  Based  on  simulations  using  the 
population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  the  median  aripiprazole  concentrations  after  an  initial  IM  depot 
administration  (solid  black  line,  left  panel)  and  its  estimated  lower  fifth  percentiles  aripiprazole 
concentrations  (hashed  black  line,  left  panel)  were  similar  to  that  of  the  concentrations  achieved  by 
administration of 10 mg oral aripiprazole. At steady state, the median aripiprazole concentration (solid 
black  line,  right  panel)  and  its  estimated  lower  fifth  and  upper  95th  percentiles  aripiprazole 
concentrations  (hashed  black  lines,  right  panel)  were  within  the  concentrations  achieved  by 
administration of 10 to 30 mg daily oral aripiprazole. 
Additional  simulation  of  aripiprazole  median  and  its  fifth  and  95th  percentiles  up  to  16  aripiprazole 
administrations and comparison with that of 10 and 30 mg aripiprazole administered as an oral tablet 
are presented in Figure 2.

Distribution 
No  specific  distribution  study  has  been  performed  with  the  IM  aripiprazole  depot  and  this  was 
considered acceptable taking into account that the distribution profile of aripiprazole has already been 
characterised with the studies previously conducted for the oral aripiprazole MA. 
Aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%). However its steady-state volume of distribution 
following  i.v.  administration  is  404L  or  4.94L/kg,  indicating  a  higher  affinity  to  tissue  proteins.  Dose 
dependent D2 receptor occupancy confirms that aripiprazole crosses the blood-brain barrier, as already 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 29/70 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
established from rat studies. No preferential distribution of aripiprazole to blood cells was established 
based on total blood to plasma activity ratio (approximately one) obtained after a 14C labelled 20 mg 
single dose of aripiprazole. 
Following  oral  administration,  aripiprazole is  widely distributed  throughout  the  body  with an  apparent 
volume of distribution of 4.9 l/kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.  
Elimination 
Following  multiple  dose  administration,  the  mean  aripiprazole  apparent  terminal  elimination  half-lives 
for  aripiprazole  IM  depot  300  mg  and  400  mg  doses  differed  significantly  (29.9  days  and  46.5  days, 
respectively  and  presumably  due  to  absorption  rate-limited  kinetics.Following  a  single  oral  dose 
administration  of  [14C]-aripiprazole,  approximately  27%  of  the  administered  radioactivity  was 
recovered  in  the  urine  and  approximately  60%  in  the  feces.  Less  than  1%  of  unchanged  aripiprazole 
was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the feces.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Less  than  Dose-proportional  increases  in  aripiprazole  and  de-hydro-aripiprazole  exposures  were 
observed after the 300 mg and 400 mg multiple doses of aripiprazole IM depot. It was noted that after 
single dose administration ranging from 15 to 400 mg, a lower exposure was observed at 400 mg as 
compared to 300 mg. This finding may be associated to the different volumes injected with the doses 
and/or  different  sites  of  administration  used  in  the  concerned  studies  and  was  considered  of  limited 
clinical relevance taking into account the data collected from phase III studies using the 400 mg as a 
starting dose (see 2.4). 
Time dependency 
No differences in PK steady state profiles were observed after repeated administrations (for 6 months 
in  31-05-244  and  44  weeks  in  31-07-246),  hence  no  significant  time  dependency  for  the 
pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole IM depot is expected. 
Inter and Intra-individual variability 
After multiple dose of IM aripiprazole depot, a higher variability in aripiprazole exposure was noted for 
the  400  mg  dose.  In  the  PK  population  analysis,  the  inter  individual  variability  of  400 mg  dose  of  IM 
aripiprazole  depot  was  found  in  the  range  of  39-42%  and  thus  not  greater  than  oral  aripiprazole 
tablets estimated in the range of 51-57%. 
Special populations 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  evaluating  demographic  variables  (e.g  race,  gender,  age)  was 
conducted.  The  effect  of  BMI  was  also  investigated.  No  studies  in  paediatric  population  with 
schizophrenia was performed in accordance with the waiver granted for all subsets of this population. 
Available information with oral aripiprazole was also considered.  
With  oral  aripiprazole,  no  clinically  relevant  effect  on  race,  gender,  age,  smoking,  renal  or  hepatic 
function was observed. 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 30/70 
  
 
 
 
After  oral  administration  of  aripiprazole,  there  are  no  differences  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
aripiprazole  between  healthy  elderly  and  younger  adult  subjects.  Similarly,  there  was  no  detectable 
effect  of  age  in  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  IM  aripiprazole    depot  in  schizophrenia 
patients.  
In  a  single-dose  study  with  oral  administration  of  aripiprazole,  the  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of 
aripiprazole  and  dehydro-aripiprazole  were  found  to  be  similar  in  patients  with  severe  renal  disease 
compared to that in young healthy subjects.  
A  single-dose  study  with  oral  administration  of  aripiprazole  to  subjects  with  varying  degrees  of  liver 
cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on 
the  pharmacokinetics  of  aripiprazole  and  dehydro-aripiprazole,  but  the  study  included  only  3  patients 
with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  were  performed  with  IM  aripiprazole  depot.  Available 
information  was  derived  from  studies  with  oral  aripiprazole.  In  addition,  simulations  and  modelling 
based on these data and the population pharmacokinetic analysis used to characterise IM aripiprazole 
depot  were  performed  to  analyse  whether  dose  adjustments  should  be  considered  in  the  following 
cases:  CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant administration of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole 
AUC  by  107%,  while  Cmax  was  not  changed.  The  AUC  and  Cmax  of  dehydro-aripiprazole,  the  active 
metabolite,  decreased  by  32%  and  47%.  Other  potent  inhibitors  of  CYP2D6,  such  as  fluoxetine  and 
paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects.  
In  a  clinical  study  with  healthy  subjects,  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  (ketoconazole)  increased 
aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37% respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole 
increased  by  77%  and  43%  respectively.  In  CYP2D6  poor  metabolisers,  concomitant  use  of  potent 
inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  may  result  in  higher  plasma  concentrations  of  aripiprazole  compared  to  that  in 
CYP2D6  extensive  metabolizers.  Other  potent  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4,  such  as  itraconazole  and  HIV 
protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects. 
Following  concomitant  administration  of  carbamazepine,  a  potent  inducer  of  CYP3A4,  the  geometric 
means  of  Cmax  and  AUC  were  68%  and  73%  lower,  respectively,  compared  to  when  aripiprazole 
(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and 
AUC  after  carbamazepine  co-administration  were  69%  and  71%  lower,  respectively,  than  those 
following aripiprazole alone treatment.  
When  either  valproate  or  lithium  were  coadministered  with  aripiprazole,  there  was  no  clinically 
significant change in aripiprazole concentrations. 
Effects  of  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  drugs,  which  are  substrate  for  the  isozymes  involved  in 
aripiprazole  biotransformation,  such  as  dextromethorphan  (CYP3A4  and  CYP2D6),  warfarin  (CYP2C9) 
and omeprazole (CYP2C19) were not significant.  
Based  on  the  simulation  modelling  data,  CYP2D6  poor  metaboliser  subjects  exhibited  aripiprazole 
concentrations  that  were  about  twice  that  of  CYP2D6  extensive  metaboliser  subjects.    Long-term 
chronic administration of aripiprazole IM depot with either a CYP2D6 or a CYP3A4 inhibitor with the 300 
mg  IM  depot  (for  subject  receiving  400  mg  aripiprazole  IM  depot)  and  200  mg  IM  depot  (for  subject 
receiving  300  mg  aripiprazole  IM  depot)  resulted  in  steady-state  median  aripiprazole  concentrations 
within  the  therapeutic  window    during  the  entire  dosing  interval.  Long-term  chronic  administration  of

aripiprazole  IM  depot  with  both  a  CYP2D6  and  a  CYP3A4  inhibitor  with  the  200  mg  IM  depot  (for 
subject  receiving  400  mg  aripiprazole IM  depot)  and  160  mg  IM  depot  (for  subject  receiving  300  mg 
aripiprazole  IM  depot)  resulted  in  steady-state  median  aripiprazole  concentrations  within  the 
therapeutic window. Long-term chronic administration of 200 mg aripiprazole IM depot with a CYP3A4 
inhibitor  in  subjects  who  are  known  poor  metabolizers  of  CYP2D6  resulted  in  steady-state  median 
aripiprazole  concentrations  comparable  with  that  of  300  mg  aripiprazole  IM  depot  and  within  the 
therapeutic window during the entire dosing interval.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Aripiprazole mechanism of action is suggested to be mediated through a combination of partial agonist 
at  dopamine  D2  receptors  and  serotonin  5-HT1A  receptors  and  antagonism  at  serotonin  5-HT2 
receptors. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary  and  secondary  pharmacology  have  already  been  characterised  with  studies  with  oral 
aripiprazole  which  consisted  in  a  single  pharmacodynamic  study  (Study  31-94-201)  and  a 
pharmacodynamic  interaction  study  between  aripiprazole  and  alcohol  (Study  31-00-230).No  specific 
study with IM aripiprazole was conducted. 
Study 31-94-201 was conducted to  determine the degree of brain D2 receptor occupancy induced by 
aripiprazole  by  PET  scanning.  A  dose-dependent  increase  in  dopamine  D2  receptor  occupancy  was 
observed at doses ranging from 0.5mg/day  to 10 mg/day. Receptor occupancy approached saturation 
at  10  mg/day  with  approximately  85%  receptor  occupancy;  at  30  mg/day,  the  next  dose  level 
evaluated,  receptor  occupancy  was  approximately  80%-95%.  Receptor  occupancy  at  the  0.5-mg/day 
dose level was approximately 23% - 46%. No data on the binding to other relevant receptors, namely 
5-HT2, are provided. 
Study  31-00-230  was  conducted  to  assess  the  potential  for  pharmacodynamic  interactions  between 
orally co-administered aripiprazole and ethanol. There were no differences in the gross motor skills or 
cognitive  abilities  when  ethanol  was  added  to  aripiprazole  and  placebo.  However  due  to  variations  in 
placebo effect it was not possible to determine if co-administration of aripiprazole with ethanol had a 
meaningful impact on cognitive function. Therefore, as mentioned in the SmPC, concomitant intake of 
alcohol with aripiprazole is not recommended. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  absorption  and  elimination  profile  of  IM  aripiprazole  depot  has  been  adequately  characterised. 
Available information on the distribution, metabolism derived mainly from studies with oral aripiprazole 
and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Following a single IM dose of aripiprazole depot ranging from 15 to 400 mg, the plasma concentrations 
of aripiprazole gradually increase to reach maximum plasma concentrations within 7-24 days (167-577 
hours).  The  release  of  the  drug  starts  as  early  as  day  1  and  the  estimated  time  required  to  absorb 
50% of the dose ranged between 10 to 35 days across the tested dose range. The average absorption 
half  life  of  IM  aripiprazole  depot  was  28  days.  The  absorption  of  aripiprazole  from  the  IM  depot 
formulation  was  considered  complete  relative  to  the  IM  standard  (immediate-release)  formulation. 
Additional  simulations  using  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  confirmed  that  similar  exposure 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 32/70 
  
 
 
 
was  achieved  for  IM  aripiprazole  depot  (400  mg  dose)  and  oral  aripiprazole  (10-30  mg)  within  an 
acceptable  time  window.  No  specific  studies  investigating  special  populations  and  drug-drug 
interactions  were  performed.    Information  related  to  renal,  hepatic  impairment,  elderly  derived  from 
oral aripiprazole and are reflected in the SmPC accordingly. 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  did  not  suggest  effects  of  race,  gender,  age,  BMI.  Based  on  the 
knowledge  on  oral  aripiprazole  interactions  with  CYP2D6  inhibitors  and  CYP3A4  inhibitors/inducers, 
additional  simulations  were  performed  and  specific  dosing  reduction  were  introduced  in  the  SmPC  in 
case of concomitant treatment greater than 14 days and in case of CYP2D6 known poor metabolisers. 
An  additional  precautionary  SmPC  statement  was  introduced  for  the  dosing  recommendation  on 
CYP2D6  or  CYP3A4  inhibitors  pending  further  modelling  from  the  applicant,  as  recommended  by  the 
CHMP.  In  the  absence  of  data  on  concomitant  use  of  CYP3A4  inducers,  the  SmPC  information  also 
recommends to avoid such association for more than 14 days. 
During  the  evaluation  (see  2.5.3),  the  applicant  followed  the  CHMP  recommendation  to  change  the 
indication  to  the  following:  “maintenance  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adult  patients  stabilized  with 
oral  aripiprazole”.  Consequently  and  on  the  basis  of  the  clinical  data  available  in  patients  orally 
stabilized  with  oral  aripiprazole,  no  further  data  were  considered  by  the  CHMP  necessary  to  address 
switching situations.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacological profile of aripiprazole IM depot in human studies has been adequately 
characterised.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The initial indication applied for is: maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults. 
The  clinical  development  included  long  term  studies  investigating  the  maintenance  of  the  effect. 
Maintenance  was  studied  in  one  placebo  controlled  withdrawal  study  and  one  active  controlled  non 
inferiority study (versus oral aripiprazole). 
In both studies, the injection site was the gluteal muscle and the  needle length for the injection was 
selected  based  on  BMI  (21  gauge,  1.5  inch  for  BMI  ≤  28  kg/m2;  21  gauge,  2  inch  for  BMI  >  28 
kg/m2). 
A tabulated summary of the efficacy studies are presented in Table 2.

Taking into  account  the  design  of  study  31-07-246  that  did  not  include  a  direct  comparison  with  oral 
aripiprazole and used a different primary efficacy endpoint than study 31-07-247, the CHMP considered 
the active controlled study 31-07-247 as the pivotal study.Study 31-07-246 is regarded as supportive 
of the present application. 
An  additional  non  inferiority  study  versus  oral  aripiprazole  (6-24  mg/day)  using  doses  of  400  mg  or 
300 mg is ongoing with a different dosing regimen for oral supplementation (6-12 mg/day) during the 
first  2  weeks.Long  term  open  label  studies  are  also  ongoing  (studies  31-08-248,  31-10-270,  31-11-
283 and 31-11-284) mainly investigating the long term safety of IM aripiprazole depot.. Interim data 
(cut off date: April 2012) related to these studies are presented as supportive of safety profile of the 
IM aripiprazole depot (see 2.6). 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No specific dose-response study was conducted for IM aripiprazole depot.. The choice of the doses for 
the phase III studies (400 mg and 300 mg) was based on PK data from multiple dose study 31-05-244 
and single dose study CN138-020 and efficacy/safety data of oral aripiprazole 10-30 mg. 
Studies 31-05-244 and CN138-020 suggested efficacy of IM aripiprazole depot at 400 mg and 300 mg 
doses,  while  once-monthly  administration  of  the  200  mg  IM  depot  injections  did  not  result  in  mean 
aripiprazole through plasma concentrations that were comparable to the therapeutic concentrations of 
10 mg to 30 mg oral aripiprazole administered daily to subjects with schizophrenia.  
Study 31-05-244 included 3 doses (200, 300 and 400 mg) administered once every 28 days for a total 
of 5 monthly doses. This study suggested that the initial administration of 400 mg IM depot resulted in 
mean  aripiprazole  trough  plasma  concentrations,  prior  to  the  administration  of  the  second  IM  depot 
administration,  that  were  equal  to  or  greater  than  steady-state  aripiprazole  concentrations 
corresponding  to  10  mg  oral  aripiprazole  (lowest  effective  oral  dose  in  patients  with  schizophrenia). 
Consequently, the 400 mg dose was selected for further evaluation in the phase III trials as initiation 
dose and 300 mg dose used in the flexible dose regimen. 
At  the  CHMP  request,  additional  simulations  of  dose  initiation  with  300  mg  aripiprazole  IM  depot  in 
subjects  stabilized  on  10-15  mg  oral  aripiprazole  with  and  without  10  mg  oral  aripiprazole

administration  for  14  days  were  provided  to  support  the  exclusion  of  the  300  mg  dose  as  initiation 
dose as well as simulation of dose initiation with 300 mg, followed by 300 mg aripiprazole IM depot in 
subjects stabilized on 10-30 mg oral aripiprazole with and without oral aripiprazole administrations for 
14  days.  These  data  predicted  median  aripiprazole  trough  concentrations  lower  than  that  of  the  pre-
dose concentrations (prior to administration of 300 mg aripiprazole IM depot) and were considered as 
sufficient evidence by the CHMP to exclude the 300 mg as starting dose. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
This  was  a  double-blind, randomised,  active-controlled,  parallel-group  study  (31-07-247)  evaluating 
the efficacy and safety of  flexible dose monthly regimens of IM aripiprazole depot (400 or 300 mg; 50 
or 25 mg) with prior conversion and stabilization with oral aripiprazole versus oral aripiprazole 10-30 
mg/day followed up by 38 weeks of treatment (see Figure 3- screening and treatment). 
Figure 3 
The study was conducted in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Estonia, 
France, Hungary, Italy, South Korea, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, and United States (US). 
2.5.2.1.  Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
Male and female subjects, aged 18 to 60 years: with a current diagnosis of schizophrenia as defined by 
DSM-IV-TR criteria and a history of the illness for at least 3 years prior to screening; who had a history 
of  symptom  exacerbation  with  interruption  or  discontinuation  of  antipsychotic  treatment,  who  were 
currently  being  treated  with  one  or  more  antipsychotic(s)  other  than  clozapine  and  who,  in  the

investigator’s  judgment,  required  chronic  treatment  with  an  antipsychotic  medication  and  would 
benefit from treatment with an aripiprazole IM depot formulation. 
Prior  to  receiving  aripiprazole  IM  depot  treatment,  subject  enrolled  were  converted  (up  to  6  weeks) 
and stabilised with oral aripiprazole for a minimum of 8 consecutive weeks. 
Main exclusion criteria 
Exclusion  criteria  mainly  included:  subjects  with  a  current  DSM-IV-TR  diagnosis  other  than 
schizophrenia  (e.g  schizoaffective  disorder,  major  depressive  disorder,  bipolar  disorder,  delirium, 
dementia,  amnestic  or  other  cognitive  disorders);  subjects  with  borderline  ,  paranoid,  histrionic, 
schizotypal,  schizoid,  or  antisocial  personality  disorder;  with  significant  risk  of  violent  behaviour  or  a 
significant risk of committing suicide based on history or investigator’s judgment, subjects treated with 
CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers  and  CYP2D6 
inhibitors  (at  all  phases); 
  antidepressants,  other 
antipsychotics,    mood  stabilisers  after  screening  phase;  electroconvulsive  therapy  (within  180  days 
prior  to  entry  into  the  stabilisation  phase);  subjects  who  had  more  than  one  excursion  from  stability 
(as per criteria) after achieving a response to oral aripiprazole at a point in the trial where they would 
not be able to maintain oral stabilisation; subjects who had not achieved stability by 28 weeks of oral 
stabilisation or who had consecutive excursions at weeks 20 and 22. 
Treatments 
Subjects eligible for the double-blind, active-controlled phase were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio 
to  double-blind  treatment  to  one  of  3  treatment  groups,  stratified  by  region  (US  and  non-US):  1) 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg,  2)  the  stabilization  dose  of  oral  aripiprazole  10-30  mg,  or  3) 
aripiprazole IM depot 50  mg/25 mg. The aripiprazole IM depot  50 mg/25 mg dose was included as a 
low-dose  aripiprazole  group  to  test  assay  sensitivity  for  the  non-inferiority  design.  Each  subject 
randomized to oral aripiprazole was randomly assigned to a placebo group to match the administration 
procedure for either the aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg group or the aripiprazole IM depot 50 
mg/25  mg  group.  In  addition,  concomitant  double-blind  oral  aripiprazole  was  given  for  2  weeks  to 
maintain therapeutic plasma concentrations. 
Eligible  subjects  who  either  completed  or  were  withdrawn  for  any  reason  after  at  least  one  dose  of 
study  medication  in  the  double-blind,  active-controlled  Phase  of  Trial  31-07-247  had  the  option  to 
enter a 52-week, long-term, open-label safety trial (Trial 31-08-248). 
Patients randomized to oral aripiprazole received the same aripiprazole dose that they were stabilized 
on during the stabilization phase. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare two dosing regimens of IM aripiprazole depot (400 or 300 mg; 
50 or 25 mg) versus oral aripiprazole (10-30 mg/day) in patients with schizophrenia, converted and 
stabilised with oral aripiprazole. 
The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the two dosing regimens of IM 
aripiprazole depot versus oral aripiprazole (10-30 mg/day), followed up by 38 weeks of treatment, in 
patients with schizophrenia, converted and stabilised with oral aripiprazole. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the estimated proportion of subjects experiencing impending relapse by end 
of 26 weeks from the date of randomization in the maintenance phase, in subjects with schizophrenia 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 36/70 
  
 
 
 
stabilised with oral aripiprazole a minimum of 8 consecutive weeks. Secondary endpoints included time 
to  impending  relapse  from  the  date  of  randomization  in  the  maintenance  phase,  percentage  of 
responders  (defined  as  stabilised  patients  at  Week  38),  Percentage  of  subjects  achieving  remission 
(defined as a score of≤ 3 on each of the following specific PANSS items, maintained for a period of 6 
months:  delusions  (P1),  unusual  thought  content  (G9),  hallucinatory  behavior  (P3),  conceptual 
disorganization (P2), mannerisms/posturing (G5), blunted affect (N1), social withdrawal (N4), and lack 
of  spontaneity  (N6),  mean  changes  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  PANSS  total  score,  CGI-S,  PANSS 
positive and negative subscales and personal and social performance (PSP) score, mean CGI-I score at 
endpoint, time to discontinuation due to all causes.    
Impending  relapse  was  defined  as  meeting  any  or  all  of  the  following  4  criteria:  1)  Clinical  Global 
Impression  of  Improvement  (CGI-I)  of  ≥  5  (minimally  worse)  and  either  an  increase  on  any  of  the 
following  individual  PANSS  items  (conceptual  disorganization,  hallucinatory  behavior,  suspiciousness, 
unusual  thought  content)  to  a  score  >  4  with  an  absolute  increase  of  ≥2  on  that  specific  item  since 
randomization  or  an  increase  on  any  of  the  following  individual  PANSS  items  (conceptual 
disorganization,  hallucinatory  behavior,  suspiciousness,  unusual  thought  content)  to  a  score  >  4  and 
an absolute increase of ≥4 on the combined 4 PANSS items (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory 
behavior,  suspiciousness,  unusual  thought  content)  since  randomization;  2)  Hospitalization  due  to 
worsening  of  psychotic  symptoms  (including  partial  hospitalization  programs),  but  excluding 
hospitalization for psychosocial reasons; 3) Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicide (CGI-SS) 
of  4  (severely  suicidal)  or  5  (attempted  suicide)  on  Part  1  and/or  6  (much  worse)  or  7  (very  much 
worse)  on  Part  2  and  4)  Violent  behavior  resulting  in  clinically  relevant  self-injury,  injury  to  another 
person, or property damage. 
Stabilised  patients  were  defined  as  fulfilling    all  of  the  following  criteria  for  8  consecutive  weeks  :1) 
outpatient status , 2) PANSS total score ≤80, 3) Lack of specific psychotic symptoms on the PANSS as 
measured  by  a  score  of  ≤4  on  each  of  the  following  items  (possible  scores  of  1  to  7  for  each  item: 
conceptual  disorganization,  suspiciousness,  hallucinatory  behaviour,  unusual  thought  content),    4) 
CGI-S ≤4 (moderately ill),  5) CGI-SS ≤2 (mildly suicidal) on Part 1 and ≤5 (minimally worsened) on 
Part 2. 
Sample size 
The  sample  sizes  were  estimated  to  achieve  about  93%  power  for  the  primary  non-inferiority 
comparison  at  an  alpha  level  of  0.05  (two-sided)  using  large  sample  normal  approximations  for  the 
distribution of the difference in binomial proportions. The assumed population proportion of impending 
relapse at or before 182 days for the oral aripiprazole (10 to 30 mg) was 18%, and the non-inferiority 
margin  was  11.5%.  The  resulting  sample  size  was  260  patients  per  arm  for  each  of  the  IM  depot 
400/300mg and oral aripiprazole (10 to 30 mg) arms.  
For the superiority comparison of IM depot 400/300mg to IM depot 50/25mg, on a 2:1 randomization, 
sample  sizes  of  260  and  130,  respectively,  provide  about  95%  power  at  alpha=0.05  (two-sided).  A 
difference of 17% is assumed. In total, 650 subjects were estimated to be randomized. 
Randomisation 
Stabilised  patients  with  oral  aripiprazole  were  randomized  to  double-blind  treatment  on  the  day  that 
the  week  8  was  fulfilled  via  an  IVRS  (Interactive  voice  response  system)  and/or  an  interactive  web 
response  (IWR)  system.  Subjects  were  randomized  2:2:1  to  one  of  3  respective  treatment  groups, 
stratified  by  region  (US  and  non-US).  In  addition,  each  subject  randomized  to  oral  aripiprazole  was 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 37/70 
  
 
 
 
randomly assigned to a placebo group to match the administration procedure for either the aripiprazole 
IM depot 400 mg/300 mg group or the aripiprazole IM depot 50 mg/25 mg group.  
Blinding (masking) 
The investigator was blinded both to treatment (active vs placebo) and to dose of aripiprazole IM depot 
(400 mg vs 50 mg vs placebo). Aripiprazole IM depot formulation could not be blinded, an unblinded 
Site  Study  Drug  Manager  (USSDM)  dispensed  open-label  and  double-blind  oral  trial  medication  at 
weekly and biweekly visits, as directed by the IVRS/IWR, and administered all IM depot injections. This 
individual  was  utilized  to  maintain  the  blind  for  site  staff  involved  with  trial  assessments.  Subjects 
randomized  to  either  dose  of  aripiprazole  IM  depot  (400  mg  or  50  mg)  continued  to  receive  oral 
aripiprazole 10 mg to 20 mg daily (dispensed as double-blind trial medication) for the first 14 days of 
maintenance phase in order to maintain therapeutic plasma concentrations.  
Statistical methods 
Primary  Efficacy  Analysis:  all  subjects  belonging  to  the  ITT  dataset  were  included.  The  test  of  non-
inferiority of aripiprazole IM depot (400 mg/300 mg) to oral aripiprazole (10 to 30 mg) was performed 
using a 95% confidence interval (CI; 2-sided) for the difference in the estimated proportion of subjects 
meeting impending relapse criteria by end of Week 26 (aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg vs oral 
aripiprazole tablets 10 mg to 30 mg). Non-inferiority was considered confirmed if the upper bound of 
the 2-sided 95% CI was below the predefined margin, 11.5%. Once non-inferiority was declared by the 
preceding  test,  superiority  of  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  over  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  was  tested  by 
examining  the  difference  in  the  estimated  proportions  of  subjects  meeting  impending  relapse  criteria 
between IM depot 400 mg/300 mg and IM depot 50 mg/25 mg by end of Week 26 using z-statistic for 
statistical significance at the 0.05 significance level (2-sided) as assay sensitivity analysis. In addition, 
a similar test was performed to compare oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg with aripiprazole IM depot 
50  mg/25  mg.  Although  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  based  on  the  ITT  population,  a  similar 
analysis  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  also  performed  by  excluding  subjects  who  were 
unblinded or potentially unblinded at site level and excluding duplicate-entry subjects with overlapping 
aripiprazole oral tablets/IM depot injections. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis: The Cox Proportional Hazard model in the model was fitted to the time to 
impending relapse event data with treatment as factor. The 95% CIs for the hazard ratios (aripiprazole 
IM depot 400 mg/300 mg to oral aripiprazole, aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg to aripiprazole IM 
depot  50 mg/25 mg) were provided. The log-rank test was performed to test the equality of survival 
curves  (aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  vs  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg)  at  the  0.05 
significance level (2-sided). Percentage of patients (with impending relapse as per criteria, responders, 
achieving  remission)  was  analysed  using  Chi-squared  tests.  Descriptive  statistics  for  other  variables 
(e.g mean changes from baseline for PANSS total score, CGI-S, PANSS positive and negative subscales, 
mean CGI-I score) were  also used with analysis using covariance (ANCOVA) model or Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel  method.  Additionally,  changes  from  baseline  in  PANSS  total  score  and  CGI-S  score  were 
analyzed  using  the  Mixed  Model  Repeated  Measures  (MMRM)  model  and  OC  datasets.  Kaplan-Meier 
curves for the time to discontinuation due to all causes were plotted and analyzed using the log-rank 
test. In order to assess sensitivity of results due to missing data, analyses were performed using both 
LOCF and OC methods. The LOCF method was used to impute the missing data at post-baseline visits 
in the stabilisation and maintenance phases for the efficacy analysis.

Participant flow- Figure 4 
Recruitment 
Study period was from 26 September 2008 to 31 August 2012. 
Conduct of the study 
Three  protocol  amendments  were  made.  These  were  related  to  study  design  and  evaluation  (mainly 
safety). Out of these amendments, a main change related to the primary efficacy endpoint was made 
from “time from randomization to exacerbation of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse in Phase 3” 
to “the proportion of subjects experiencing exacerbation of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse by 
end of 26 weeks of treatment from the date of randomization in Phase 3, in schizophrenic subjects who 
have maintained stability on oral aripiprazole for at least 8 consecutive weeks in Phase 2 of the study.” 
The original primary efficacy endpoint, “time to exacerbation of psychic symptoms/impending relapse” 
became,  under  this  amendment,  a  secondary  efficacy  endpoint.  The  statistical  method  was 
consequently amended considering this change. 
Overall,  8  subjects  discontinued  due  to  protocol  deviations:  2  during  the  stabilisation  phase  and  6 
during  the  maintenance  phase.  The  proportion  of  patients  was  2(0.8%)  in  the  IM  aripiprazole  depot 
400mg/300mg  group,  3  (1.1%)  in  the  oral  aripiprazole  10-30  mg  group  and  1  (0.8%)  in  the  IM 
aripiprazole depot 50 mg/25 mg.

During the study, 12 subjects were identified as either enrolled at 2 different study sites or enrolled in 
another trial investigating aripiprazole IM depot (Trial 31-07-246 or Trial 31-08-248). There were also 
13 confirmed individual subject unblindings during the course of the study, including 2 intentional and 
11  unintentional  unblindings.  Efficacy  analysis  was  conducted  including  and  excluding  these  patients.  
A  total  of  662  patients  were  randomised:    265/662  in  Aripiprazole  IM  (400/300mg)  arm,  266/662  in 
Aripiprazole oral (10-30 mg) arm, and 131/662 in Aripiprazole IM (50/25mg) arm. Completers in each 
arm were: 196/662 in Aripiprazole IM (400/300), 178/662 in Aripiprazole oral (10-30 mg), and 61/662 
in Aripiprazole IM (50/25mg).

Secondary efficacy results 
The  proportion  of  responders  (ie,  subjects  who  met  the  stability  criteria)  at  endpoint  double  blind 
maintenance  phase  was  89.8%  (237/264)  in  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group 
compared with 89.4% (235/263) in the oral aripiprazole 10-30 mg group, and 75.2% (97/129) in the 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  group.  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  the  proportion  of 
responders  between  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group  and  the  oral  aripiprazole  10-30 
mg group (p = 0.8750); however, the proportion of responders was statistically significantly higher in

the aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg group than in the aripiprazole IM depot 50 mg/25 mg group 
(p = 0.0001). 
The proportion of subjects achieving remission was 48.8% (105/215) in the aripiprazole IM depot 400 
mg/300  mg  group  compared  with  53.2%  (107/201)  in  the  oral  aripiprazole  10-30  mg  group,  and 
59.7%  (43/72)  in  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  group.  The  differences  between  the 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group  and  oral  aripiprazole  10-30  mg  group,  and  between  the 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  and  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  groups  were  not 
statistically significant (p = 0.3700 and p = 0.1097, respectively). 
Sixty seven (67/265, 25.3%) patients treated with IM aripiprazole 400mg/300 mg depot discontinued 
due to all causes by Day 280, as compared to 87 (87/266, 32.7%) in the oral aripiprazole 10-30 mg 
group, 266 subjects were randomly assigned to treatment in the Double blind, Active-controlled Phase; 
87  discontinued  by  Day  280,  for  a  discontinuation  rate  of  32.7%.  There  was  a  statistically  significant 
difference  in  time  to  discontinuation  due  to  all  reasons  between  the  2  groups  (log-rank  test,  p  = 
0.0484) in favor of the aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg treatment group.  In the aripiprazole IM 
depot 50 mg/25 mg group, 70 of the 131 subjects randomly assigned to treatment discontinued, for a 
discontinuation  rate  of  53.4%.  The  median  time  to  discontinuation  was  234  days  and  there  was  a 
statistically  significant  difference  between  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  and  the 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  groups  (p  <  0.0001)  in  favor  of  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400 
mg/300 mg treatment group. 
For  subjects  in  the  double  blind  maintenance  phase,  a  0.45  and  0.08  point  increases  for  the 
aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg and oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg groups,were noted in the 
PSP  total  score,  respectively.  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  the  magnitude  of  the  change 
between the 2 treatment groups (p = 0.9946). However, for subjects in the aripiprazole IM depot 50 
mg/25 mg group, the PSP total score decreased from baseline to the last visit during the double blind 
maintenance  phase  (-2.39  points),  indicating  a  decrease  in  social  functioning.  The  difference  in  the 
change from baseline to last visit in the PSP score was statistically significant between the aripiprazole 
IM depot 50 mg/25 mg group and the aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg group (p = 0.0266).

Although the design of study 31-07-246 (see Figure 8) was different than the main study 31-07-247, 
as described above, the enrolled subject population, efficacy assessments, and criteria for stability and 
impending relapse were the same in these studies.

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  time  to  impending  relapse  during  the  Double-blind,  Placebo-
controlled Phase.  A prespecified interim efficacy analysis was performed and included 344 randomized 
subjects  and  64  events  of  impending  relapse.    These  interim  data  showed  that  time  to  impending

relapse  was  significantly  shorter  for  subjects  randomized  to  placebo  compared  with  subjects 
randomized to aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg in the double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase (p 
< 0.0001; log-rank test). The hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazard model for the placebo to 
aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg comparison was 4.72 (95% CI = 2.81, 7.94); thus, subjects in 
the placebo group had a 4.72-fold greater risk of experiencing impending relapse than subjects in the 
aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg group. The hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazard model 
for  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  to  placebo  comparison  was  0.212  (95%  CI  =  0.126, 
0.357).  
The final efficacy analysis included 403 randomized subjects and 80 impending relapse events. Results 
from  the  final  analysis  were  consistent  with  the  interim  analysis  results  showing  that  the  time  to 
impending  relapse  was  significantly  shorter  for  subjects  in  the placebo  group  compared  with  subjects 
in the aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg group (p < 0.0001; log-rank test). The hazard ratio from 
the  Cox  proportional  hazard  model  for  the  placebo  to  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg 
comparison  was  5.029  (95%  CI  =  3.154,  8.018),  thus  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  had  a  5.03-fold 
greater risk of experiencing impending relapse than subjects in the aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 
mg group. The hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazard model for the aripiprazole IM depot 400 
mg/300 mg to placebo comparison was 0.199 (95% CI = 0.125, 0.317). See Figure 9. 
Figure 9   Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Plot for Time to Exacerbation of Psychotic 
Symptoms/Impending Relapse 
Additional  efficacy  analysis  following  the  last  dose  in  the  oral  stabilization  phase  was  performed 
showing  that  the  effect  of  IM  aripiprazole  depot  was  sustained  up  to  6  weeks  (i.e.,  2-week  delay  in 
dosing) in case of patients missing their doses. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
According to the CHMP guideline on clinical development on schizophrenia (EMA/CHMP/40072/2010 
Rev. 1) which incorporated the existing CHMP appendix related to methodology of clinical trials 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 49/70 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
concerning the development of depot preparations of approved medicinal products in schizophrenia, 
depot preparations of antipsychotic products will usually be given after the patient is stabilised on the 
oral form. For the latter, efficacy and safety will have been shown in agreement with the existing 
guidance. This implies that not only the effect in short-term trials is known but shown that the effect of 
the product is maintained over time. The duration of the studies (more than 6 months double blind 
maintenance phase) were considered sufficient to support the claim for maintenance treatment in 
schizophrenia. The applicant followed this CHMP guideline and presented two efficacy studies aiming at 
demonstrating maintenance of the effect of the depot formulation (31-07-246, 31-07-247), as well as 
non-inferiority versus the oral formulation (31-07-247). According to the applicant, study 31-07-246 
was conducted following recommendation from other regulatory authorities. Taking into account the 
design of study 31-07-246 that did not include a direct comparison with oral aripiprazole and used a 
different primary efficacy endpoint than study 31-07-247, the CHMP therefore considered the active 
controlled study 31-07-247 as the pivotal study. Study 31-07-246 is regarded as supportive of the 
present application. 
In the study population, patients were stabilised on oral treatment before evaluating the efficacy of the 
depot formulation in maintenance treatment. The demographic characteristics for subjects randomized 
to the double blind maintenance phase were similar to those seen in the previous phases; most 
subjects randomized were male (406/662, 61.3%), Caucasian (387/662, 58.5%), and non-
Hispanic/Latino (564/662, 85.2%). The percentages of Black or African American and Asian subjects 
were 23.1% (153/662 subjects) and 10.4% (69/662 subjects), respectively. The mean age was 41.2 
years and mean BMI was 28.8 kg/m2 (ranged from 17.3 to 57.6 kg/m2). These baseline data were 
comparable across treatment groups. Whilst overall, the CHMP considered that the patients included in 
study 31-04-247 were sufficiently representative of the intended population (with inclusion of EU 
patients), the mean age (considered slightly higher than expected) and the long duration of the oral 
stabilisation (for at least 8 weeks) may have been possible factors contributing to the lower than 
anticipated relapse rate observed in both studies.. 
In study 31-07-247, the main protocol changes related to the primary efficacy endpoint was discussed 
during  a  CHMP  scientific  advice.  Change  from  “time  from  randomization  to  exacerbation  of  psychotic 
symptoms/impending  relapse  in  Phase  3”  to  “the  proportion  of  subjects  experiencing  exacerbation  of 
psychotic  symptoms/impending  relapse  by  end  of  26  weeks  of  treatment  from  the  date  of 
randomization in Phase 3, in schizophrenic subjects who have maintained stability on oral aripiprazole 
for  at  least  8  consecutive  weeks  in  Phase  2  of  the  study”  was  proposed  due  to  the  lower  than  the 
anticipated relapse rates observed during the study ,  the original primary efficacy endpoint, becoming 
a  secondary  efficacy  endpoint.  During  this  scientific  advice,  the  CHMP  considered  that  this  change 
might  require  a  further  revision  of  the  non  inferiority  margin  of  the  IM  depot  (originally  of  15%, 
considering 31% relapse rate), suggesting a lowering of the proposed 11.5% to 10% margin. 
The initial indication applied for was: maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults. On the basis of 
the design of the presented efficacy studies, the CHMP recommended to change the indication to the 
following: “maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients stabilized with oral aripiprazole”. 
This was agreed by the applicant. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  pivotal  study  31-07-247,  the  objective  of  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  to  demonstrate  non-
inferiority of aripiprazole im depot 400 mg/300 mg to oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg with regard to 
the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  “proportion  of  subjects  experiencing  impending  relapse”  and  thereafter 
to show superiority of the im formulation over the pseudo placebo (aripiprazole im 50/25 mg) for assay 
sensitivity. The estimated relapse rate by end of Week 26 was 7.12% in the aripiprazole IM depot 400 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 50/70 
  
 
 
 
mg/300 mg group and 7.76% in the oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg group, a difference of −0.6%. 
The  95%  CI  (−5.26,  3.99)  for  the  difference  in  the  estimated  proportion  of  subjects  experiencing 
impending relapse by end of Week 26 excluded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 11.5%.  Since 
the difference in relapse rate between IM formulation and the oral form of -0.6% in favour of the IM 
arm with a 95% CI ranging between -5.26 and 3.99 showed an upper bound of 4% for the difference 
between  IM  and  oral  formulation,  the  CHMP  considered  that  non-inferiority  was  demonstrated.  Even 
with  a  10%  margin,  as  suggested  in  the  CHMP  scientific  advice,  the  actual  results  would  still 
demonstrate  non  inferiority,  the  pre-specified  non  inferiority  margin  of  11.5%  was  therefore  not 
further questioned by the CHMP. The estimated proportion of subjects experiencing impending relapse 
by  end  of  Week  26  for  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group  was  statistically  significantly 
lower  than  that  of  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  group  (21.8%;  p  =  0.0006).  Thus, 
superiority  of  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  over  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  was 
considered established by the CHMP and the validity of the trial design ie the results were not due to 
lack of events and assay sensitivity was confirmed.  
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  time  to  impending  relapse,  was  similar  in  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot 
400 mg/300 mg group as compared with the oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg group (hazard ratio = 
0.992, 95% CI = 0.545, 1.803). However, the time to impending relapse was statistically significantly 
delayed  (ie,  improved)  in  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group  compared  with  the 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  group  (log-rank  test,  p  <  0.0001).  The  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50 
mg/25  mg  group  had  a  3.158-fold  higher  risk  of  relapse  than  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300 
mg  group  (95%  CI  =  1.813,  5.502).  Other  secondary  results  were  also  consistent  with  the  primary 
efficacy  analysis  showing  stabilisation  of  the  psychotic  symptoms  in  patients  treated  with  IM 
aripiprazole  depot  400mg/300  mg  and  suggesting  that  the  lower  dose  was  not  efficacious  in  the 
proposed indication.  
Moreover, the proportion of responders was statistically significantly higher in the aripiprazole IM depot 
400 mg/300 mg group than in the aripiprazole IM depot 50 mg/25 mg group (p = 0.0001). 
In the supportive study 31-07-246, the primary efficacy variable was the time to impending relapse in 
adult  subjects  with  schizophrenia  who  maintained  stability  for  at  least  12  consecutive  weeks  on 
aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg. Results showed that time to impending relapse was significantly 
shorter  for  subjects  randomized  to  placebo  compared  with  subjects  randomized  to  aripiprazole  IM 
depot  400  mg/300  mg  in  the  double  blind  maintenance  phase  (p  <  0.0001;  log-rank  test)  further 
supporting the primary efficacy analysis. 
Dosing recommendation 
Based  on  the  dosing  regimens,  the  method  of  administration  used  and  the  results  observed  in  the 
efficacy  studies,  the  applicant  proposed  a  starting  and  maintenance  dose  of  400  mg,  to  be 
administered monthly in the gluteal muscle, with possible lower maintenance dose of 300 mg based on 
individual  patient  tolerability.  The  first  dose  should  be  accompanied  by  14  consecutive  days  of 
concurrent treatment with 10 mg to 20 mg of oral aripiprazole. On the basis that patients who will be 
switching to the IM depot can be stabilized to different doses of oral aripiprazole (ranging from 10-30 
mg),  the  CHMP  requested  additional  analyses  to  support  such  dosing  recommendation.  Simulations 
were  provided  and  considered  satisfactory  by  the  CHMP.  These  included  cases  where  patients  were 
stabilized on 10 to 30 mg daily oral aripiprazole and continued with 10 mg (patients receiving 10 to 20 
mg  oral  aripiprazole  prior  to  IM  depot  initiation)  or  15  mg  (patients  receiving  20  to  30  mg  oral 
aripiprazole prior to IM depot initiation) oral aripiprazole for 2 weeks after IM depot administration. In 
addition, the applicant clarified that the proposed concomitant use of oral aripiprazole for 2 weeks after 
administration  of  the  initial  dose  of  aripiprazole  IM  depot  was  to  maintain  aripiprazole  concentrations 
around  predose  IM  depot  aripiprazole  concentrations  given  the  known  slow  absorption  of  IM 
Abilify Maintena

aripiprazole depot from the site of administration and was not an additional oral loading dose. Overall, 
the initial proposed dosing recommendation was sufficiently justified and no change was proposed by 
the CHMP. 
In addition, simulations and additional efficacy analyses (see study 31-07-246) were also provided to 
support dosing recommendation in case of missed doses and included scenarios with delays of varying 
duration  in  the  timing  of  the  2nd,  3rd,  4th  and  10th  aripiprazole  IM  depot  administrations  occurred. 
Simulation  data  showed  the  following  situations:  1)  when  the  2nd  dose  was  delayed  by  1  week  (7 
days),  the  median  aripiprazole  concentration  was  slightly  below  the  threshold  of  the  therapeutic 
window; 2) When the 3rd dose was delayed by 1 week, the median aripiprazole concentration did not 
drop  below  the  threshold  of  the  therapeutic  window;  3)  When  the  4th  (representing  steady  state)  or 
the  10th  aripiprazole  IM  depot  doses  were  delayed  by  2  weeks  (14  days),  the  median  aripiprazole 
concentrations did not drop below the threshold of the therapeutic window. In addition, the simulation 
analysis predicted that administration of aripiprazole IM depot without concomitant oral therapy during 
a  1-week  (7  days)  delay  for  Doses  2  and  3  and  during  a  2-week  (14  days)  delay  for  doses  4  and 
beyond  would  result  in  median  aripiprazole  concentrations  above  the  therapeutic  window  after 
administration  of  aripiprazole  IM  depot.  On  this  basis  and  considering  the  efficacy  of  IM  aripiprazole 
depot  was  sustained  up  to  6  weeks  (i.e.,  2-week  delay  in  dosing)  in  case  of  patients  missing  their 
doses  in  study  31-27-246,  it  can  be  recommended  that  when  the  monthly  aripiprazole  IM  depot 
administration  is  delayed,  it  should  be  administered  as  soon  as  possible  and  concomitant  oral 
aripiprazole dosing is not needed if the delay is no longer than 7 days for the 2nd and 3rd injections 
and  14  days  for  the  4th  and  subsequent  aripiprazole  IM  depot  injections.  However,  if  aripiprazole  IM 
depot  injections  are  delayed  beyond  7  days  for  Doses  2  and  3  and  beyond  14  days  for  Doses  4  and 
beyond, then re-initiation of therapy is needed (i.e., concurrent oral administration of aripiprazole for 2 
weeks with the aripiprazole IM Depot injection). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  efficacy  in  the  maintenance  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adults, 
stabilised with oral aripiprazole was demonstrated in the proposed dosing regimen for Abilify Maintena. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety database presented in the dossier included the following datasets:1) completed phase III 
controlled trials (31-07-246 and 31-07-247) and 2) all trials (completed and ongoing) excluding trial 
31-08-003 which is an ongoing, double blind trial. 
Patient exposure 
As of April 2012, 1,624 adult subjects with schizophrenia have been exposed to aripiprazole IM depot 
(15-400 mg).  Additional subjects have been exposed to aripiprazole IM depot in an ongoing Japanese 
double-blind phase 3 trial (trial 031-08-003), but treatment remains blinded and therefore these data 
are  not  available  at  this  time.  Of  the  1,624  adult  subjects  exposed  to  aripiprazole  IM  depot,  1,539 
subjects have been treated with aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg, 995 subjects have received at 
least 7 aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg injections (ie, have been treated for at least 6 months), 
784 subjects have received at least 13 injections (ie, have been treated for at least 12 months), and 
244 subjects received at least 26 injections (ie, have been treated for 24 months).

Treatment-emergent  AEs  potentially  related  to  trial  medication  reported  for  ≥  5%  and  <  10%  of 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  subjects  were  increased  weight  (48/534,  9.0%),  akathisia 
(42/534, 7.9%), insomnia (31/534, 5.8%), and injection site pain (27/534, 5.1%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
During  the  double-blind  controlled  maintenance  phase,  the  incidence  of  deaths  due  to  TEAEs  was 
comparable  in  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group,  oral  aripiprazole  tablets  10-30  mg 
group,  and  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  group.  Three  subjects  died;  one  subject  in  the 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group  (1/534,  0.2%)  died  due  to  pancreatic  carcinoma,  one 
subject (1/266, 0.4%) in the oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg group died due to cardiac arrest, and 
one subject (1/131, 0.8%) in the aripiprazole IM depot 50 mg/25 mg group died due to a completed 
suicide  No  subjects  treated  with  placebo  died  during  the  double-blind  treatment  phase.  No  TEAE 
leading  to  death  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  trial  treatment.  Serious  TEAEs 
were  observed  as  follows:  26/534  (4.9%)  in  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group,  15/266 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 55/70 
 
  
 
 
 
(5.6%) in oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg group, 11/131 (8.4%) in aripiprazole IM depot 50 mg/25 
mg  group,  and  9/134  (6.7%)  in  placebo  group.  The  only  serious  TEAEs  reported  for  >  1%  of 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  subjects  were  schizophrenia  and  psychotic  disorder  and 
occurred  as  follows:  7/534  (1.3%)  in  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group,  2/266  (0.8%)  in 
oral  aripiprazole  tablets  10-30  mg  group,  3/131  (2.3%)in  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  group, 
and in 2/134 (1.5%) placebo group. 
In  all  trials,  10  (0.6%)  of  1539  aripiprazole  IM  depot  300-400  mg  subjects  and  1/168  (0.6%) 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  <  300  mg  subjects  died  due  to  TEAEs.    Although  the  causes  of  death  varied, 
approximately  half  of  the  deaths  appeared  to  be  cardiovascular-related  (ie,  myocardial  infarction, 
cardiac  arrest,  cardio  respiratory  arrest,  coronary  artery  insufficiency,  arteriosclerosis).    Treatment 
emergent AEs resulting in death were considered by the investigator to be either not likely related or 
unrelated to trial medication except for one event  of cardiac arrest.  One event of cardiac arrest was 
considered by the investigator to be possibly related to trial medication in the absence of other direct 
causes. 
Laboratory findings 
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  mean  changes  in  hematology,  blood  chemistry,  and  urinalysis.  A 
higher  incidence  of  potentially  clinically  relevant  low  WBC  count  in  study  31-07-247,  IM  aripiprazole 
depot  400  mg/300mg:  6/260  (2.3%)  versus  oral  aripiprazole  10-30  mg:2/258  (0.8%).  No  IM 
aripiprazole depot 50mg/25 mg had potentially clinically relevant low WBC value. During double blind 
maintenance phases, 3/534 (0.6%) aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg subjects, 1/266 (0.4%) oral 
aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg subjects, and 1/131 (0.8%) aripiprazole IM depot 50 mg/25 mg subjects 
had TEAEs related to WBC abnormalities. The abnormality in each group was neutropenia. Neutropenia 
was  transient  in  4  of  the  5  subjects  (including  one  subject  with  a  medical  history  of  neutropenia). 
Neutropenia  continued  in  the  fifth  subject  treated  with  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg); 
however, it was also present at screening in this subject and resolved during the open label study 31-
08-248.  No  placebo  subject  had  a  TEAE  related  to  WBC  abnormalities.  Neutropenia  case  typically 
started around day 16 after first injection, and lasts a median of 18 days.

a: Ne is the total number of subjects with a post-baseline weight result at the visit. 
b: n is the number of subjects meeting the criteria for potential clinical relevance. 
c: Change from Double-blind, Active-controlled Phase baseline. 
The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  related  to  weight  was  14.3%  (166/1160)  for  subjects  treated  with 
aripiprazole IM depot 300-400 mg ≥3 months and 18.6% (41/221) for subjects treated ≥24 months. 
There  were  increases  in  the  incidence  of  the  following  weight-related  TEAEs  in  subjects  with  longer 
exposure  to  aripiprazole  IM  depot  300-400  mg:  increased  weight  (9.4%  [109/1160]  for  ≥3  months 
exposure and 13.1% [29/221] for exposure ≥24 months) and decreased weight (5.0% [58/1160] for 
exposure ≥3 months to 5.9% [13/221] for exposure ≥24 months). 
Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) 
During  double-blind  maintenance  phase  treatment-emergent  EPS  and  EPS-related  AEs  were  reported 
for 98/534 (18.4%) aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg subjects, 31/266 (11.7%) oral aripiprazole 
tablets 10-30 mg subjects, 16/131 (12.2%) aripiprazole IM depot 50 mg/25 mg subjects, and 13/134 
(9.7%)  placebo  subjects.  The  difference  between  treatment  groups  in  the  incidence  of  treatment-
emergent EPS and EPS-related AEs was considered clinically relevant and this is considered as a well 
known effect of atypical antipsychotics. In the aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg group, the most 
frequently  reported  treatment-emergent  EPS  and  EPS-related  events  were  akathisia  events  (44/534 
subjects, 8.2%) followed by parkinsonism events (37/534 subjects, 6.9%). 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 57/70 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In  all  trials,  249/1539  (16.2%)  aripiprazole  IM  depot  300-400  mg  subjects  had  treatment-emergent 
EPS  and  EPS-related  AEs.  The  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  EPS  and  EPS-related  AEs 
excluding akathisia was 10.7% (164/1539) of subjects treated with aripiprazole IM depot 300-400 mg. 
The  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  EPS  and  EPS-related  AEs  was  18.2%  (211/1160)  for 
subjects treated with aripiprazole IM depot 300-400 mg ≥ 3 months and 22.2% (49/221) for subjects 
treated ≥ 24 months. The overall incidence of EPS and EPS-related AEs excluding akathisia was 12.7% 
(147/1160)  for  aripiprazole  IM  depot  300-400  mg  subjects  treated  ≥  3  months  and  19.0%  (42/221) 
for subjects treated≥24 months.In study 31-08-248, the incidence of any treatment-emergent EPS or 
EPS-related  AEs  by  time  to  onset  after  the  first  IM  aripiprazole  depot  400  mg/300  mg  injection  was 
≤1.5% in patients without prior IM aripiprazole depot exposure. 
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) 
In  all  trials,  there  was  a  single  reported  event  of  NMS  among  the  IM  aripiprazole  depot  treated 
population.  The  subject  was  randomized  to  and  treated  with  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  in 
study  31-07-247.  During  the  maintenance  phase,  on  day  68,  the  subject  was  agitated  with  altered 
mental  status.  During  hospitalization,  NMS  with  dehydration,  respiratory  failure,  metabolic  acidosis, 
aspiration  pneumonia,  rhabdomyolysis,  and  acute  renal  failure  was  provisionally  diagnosed.  The 
investigator  considered  this  case  as    serious,  severe  NMS  in  severity  and  potentially  related  to  trial 
medication  and  led  to  trial  discontinuation.  This  NMS  case  did  resolve  20  days  later  with  sequelae. 
(acute renal failure). 
Suicidality 
The incidence of suicidality-related TEAEs in the controlled trials was low overall, although it was noted 
that  there  were  more  suicide  attempts  and  suicide  ideation  in  IM  depot  aripiprazole    treated  patients 
than with oral aripiprazole treated patients . See Table 12. 
Except  for  the  fatal  event  of  completed  suicide  in  one  subject  in  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25 
mg  group,  all  suicidality  events  resolved.  In  trial  31-07-246,  2  events  of  suicidal  ideation  were 
considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug. In trial 31-07-247, suicidal 
ideation  in  one  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  subject  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be 
definitely related to study drug, and all other TEAEs related to suicidal ideation/suicide were considered 
by the investigator to be unrelated or not likely related to study drug.

ideation/suicide in trials 31-07-246 and 31-07-247

Comparison  on  the  time  of  onset  of  the  suicidality  related  events  did  not  reveal  relevant  difference  
between IM aripiprazole depot and oral aripiprazole. 
Convulsions/Seizures 
The  incidence  of  convulsions/seizures  was  low  in  each  treatment  group.  During  double-blind 
maintenance  phase,  1/131  (0.8%)  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg  subjects  and  1/134  (0.7%) 
placebo subjects had TEAEs of convulsions/seizures. 
In  all  trials,  2/1539  (0.1%)  aripiprazole  IM  depot  300-400  mg  subjects  had  TEAEs  related  to 
convulsions/seizures. Both events occurred in subjects treated with aripiprazole IM depot 300-400 mg 
≤3 months (2/1160, 0.2%). One subject (1/168, 0.6%) treated with aripiprazole IM depot < 300 mg 
(any  exposure)  also  had  a  convulsion.  In  study  31-08-248,  convulsion  occurred  in  1/388  (0.3%) 
subjects ≤3 months after the first aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg injection. 
Orthostasis 
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  related  to  orthostasis  was  low  in  subjects  treated  with  aripiprazole  IM  depot 
400 mg/300 mg. During double-blind maintenance treatment, these events were reported as follows: 
2/534 (0.4%) in aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg group, 2/266 (0.8%) in oral aripiprazole tablets 
10-30 mg group, and 1/131 (0.8%) aripiprazole IM depot 50 mg/25 mg group and  included postural 
dizziness  in  1/266  (0.4%)  in    oral  aripiprazole  10-30  mg  group;  syncope  in  1/534  (0.2%)  in 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group  and  1/131  (0.8%)  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg 
subjects; and orthostatic hypotension in 1/534 (0.2%) in aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg group 
and  1/266  (0.4%)  in  oral  aripiprazole  10-30  mg  group.  No  placebo  subject  had  TEAEs  related  to 
orthostasis.  No  subjects  had  vital  signs  indicative  of  orthostatic  hypotension.In  all  trials,  16/1539 
(1.0%)  aripiprazole  IM  depot  300-400  mg  subjects  had  TEAEs  related  to  orthostasis.  The  overall 
incidence  of  TEAEs  related  to  orthostasis  in  subjects  treated  with  aripiprazole  IM  depot  300-400  mg 
was 1.2% (14/1160) for exposure ≥3 months and 1.4% (3/221) for subjects treated ≥24 months. 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 59/70 
 
  
 
 
 
In study 31-08-248, TEAEs related to orthostasis that were reported during the trial included postural 
dizziness and syncope in patients without prior IM aripiprazole depot exposure. Postural dizziness and 
syncope were each reported for 1/314 (0.3%) subjects within 6-9 months after their first aripiprazole 
IM depot 400 mg/300 mg injection. 
Local injection site reactions 
During  the  double  blind  maintenance  phase,  injection  site-related  TEAEs  in  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot 
400  mg/300  mg  group  included  injection  site  pain  (28/534  subjects,  5.2%),  injection  site  induration 
(8/534,  1.5%),  injection  site  swelling  (3/534,  0.6%),  injection  site  erythema  (3/534,  0.6%),  and 
injection  site  discomfort,  injection  site  pruritus,  injection  site  reaction,  and  vessel  puncture  site  pain 
(each  in  1/534,  0.2%).  Injection  site  reactions  reported  by  oral  aripiprazole  10-30  mg  subjects 
included  injection  site  pain  (6/266,  2.3%),  injection  site  erythema  (3/266,  1.1%),  and  injection  site 
induration and injection site swelling (each in 2/266, 0.8%). In the aripiprazole IM depot 50 mg/25 mg 
group,  injection  site-related  TEAEs  included  injection  site  pain  (1/131,  0.8%).  In  the  aripiprazole 
placebo group, injection site-related TEAEs included injection site pain (5/134, 3.7%) and injection site 
erythema  (1/134,  0.7%).  In  both  efficacy  studies,  infrequent  injection  site  reactions  were  observed; 
those seen were generally mild to moderate in severity, and resolved over time. 
In  all  trials,  121/1539  (7.9%)  aripiprazole  IM  depot  300-400  mg  subjects  had  TEAEs  related  to  the 
injection  site.  The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  related  to  the  injection  site  in  subjects  treated  with 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  300-400  mg  was  9.3%  (108/1160)  for  subjects  treated  ≥3  months  and  11.3% 
(25/221)  for  subjects  treated  ≥24  months.  There  were  increases  in  the  incidence  of  the  following 
injection  site-related  TEAEs  in  subjects  with  longer  exposure  to  aripiprazole  IM  depot  300-400  mg: 
injection  site  pain  (95/1160  [8.2%]  for  subjects  treated  ≥3  months  and  20/221  [9.0%]  subjects 
treated  for  ≥24  months)  and  injection  site  induration  (12/1160  [1.0%]  and  6/221  [2.7%], 
respectively).  
The incidence of TEAEs related to the injection site was low (< 1.0%) for each time period except for 
the injection site pain in subjects without prior exposure to aripiprazole IM depot. See Table 13.

Subjects with multiple occurrences of TEAEs are counted only once per specific category. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses by region, gender, age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI did not reveal clinically meaningful 
differences in the safety profile of IM aripiprazole depot.

Pregnancies were reported in 7 subjects treated with aripiprazole IM depot (including one false positive 
test result) and 7 female partners of male subjects treated with aripiprazole IM depot.. Two additional 
pregnancies were reported during the double-blind treatment phase of ongoing trial 031-08-003. Three 
subjects (including one female partner) had normal full-term infants via spontaneous vaginal delivery 
with no complications and one infant was born with congenital bilateral club feet (considered unrelated 
to study drug); 3 subjects (all female partners) delivered full-term infants via cesarean section with no 
complications;  one  subject  (female  partner)  delivered  a  healthy  pre-term  infant  via  vaginal  delivery 
with no complications; 4 subjects (including one female partner) elected to terminate their pregnancy, 
and 2 subjects (including one female partner) had spontaneous abortions. In addition, an infant born 
to  another  female  partner  was  referred  to  a  neurologist  at  7  months  of  age  as  the  paediatrician  was 
concerned  that  the  infant  may  have  cerebral  palsy.  No  information  has  been  received  about  this 
evaluation. This case was considered by investigator as unrelated to study drug. Based on the available 
data,  IM  aripiprazole  depot  should  only  be  used  during  pregnancy  after  careful  assessment  of  the 
benefit-risk profile in this population and considering the long-acting properties of the product. 
IM aripiprazole depot has not been studied in the paediatric population and no safety data are available 
according to the waiver granted for all subsets of this population. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  additional  data  other  than  the  information  derived  from  the  clinical  pharmacology  of  oral 
aripiprazole  were  presented.  The  CHMP  noted  that  both  efficacy  studies  (31-04-247  and  31-04-246) 
excluded patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers and CYP2D6 inhibitors (at all phases). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During  double-blind  maintenance  treatment,  TEAEs  resulting  in  drug  discontinuation  were  as  follows: 
40/534  (7.5%)  in  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group,  19/266  (7.1%)  in  oral  aripiprazole 
group, 24/131 (18.3%) in aripiprazole IM depot 50 mg/25 mg group, and 18/134 (13.4%) in placebo 
group. Treatment-emergent AEs resulting in drug discontinuation reported for ≥ 1% of aripiprazole IM 
depot  400  mg/300  mg  subjects  were  psychotic  disorder  and  schizophrenia.  TEAE  related  to  EPS 
symptoms  and  leading  to  discontinuation  were  only  reported  in  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot 
400mg/300mg group (n=8, 0.5%). 
In  all  trials,  one  hundred  forty-five  (9.4%)  of  1,539  aripiprazole  IM  depot  300-400  mg  subjects  had 
TEAEs  resulting  in  drug  discontinuation  compared  with  25/168  (14.9%)  aripiprazole  IM  depot  <  300 
mg  subjects.  Most  AEs  in  the  IM  depot  <300  mg  were  due  to  treatment  failure  AEs  (5.4%  for  each 
psychotic disorder and schizophrenia). 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data for IM aripiprazole depot are presented since the product was not marketed in 
any countries at the time of the initial submission. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  database  for  IM  aripiprazole  depot  was  considered  adequate,  considering  that  more  than 
1000  patients  were  treated  for  at  least  6  months  (patient  exposure  greater  than  1600  subjects).  No 
new  safety  concern  was  identified  as  compared  to  the  safety  profile  of  oral  and  rapid  IM  aripiprazole 
with  the  exception  of  local  injection  site  reactions,  and  specifically    injection  site  pain. Local  injection 
site  reactions  were  also  reported  as  preclinical  findings.  A  higher  incidence  of  potentially  clinically 
Abilify Maintena 
EMA/737723/2013 
Page 61/70 
  
 
 
 
relevant  low  WBC  count  was  also  observed  in  study  31-07-247  in  the  IM  aripiprazole  depot  400 
mg/300mg  arm  (6/260,  2.3%)  compared  to  the  oral  aripiprazole  10-30  mg  arm  (2/258 
,0.8%).The   applicant  clarified  that  among  those  patients  having  potentially  clinically  relevant  low 
WBC,  3 out of 6 (50%) had low WBC values present at baseline in the IM aripiprazole depot 400/300 
mg arm. However, from the CHMP viewpoint, the low WBC values persisted over time, hence the CHMP 
agreed with the PRAC recommendation to include this safety concern as important identified risk in the 
risk  management  plan.  Additionally,  the  CHMP  considered  as  relevant  for  the  prescribers  the  time  of 
onset of neutropenia. This is reflected in the SmPC accordingly. 
The  most  frequently  observed  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  reported  in  ≥ 5 %  of  patients  in  two 
double-blind  controlled  clinical  trials  of  Abilify  Maintena  were  weight  increased  (9.0 %),  akathisia 
(7.9 %),  insomnia  (5.8 %),  and  injection  site  pain  (5.1 %).On  the  basis  of  the  presented  data 
regarding EPS (excluding akathisia) and weight gain, increasing incidences were observed over time.. 
Given the higher frequency of EPS symptoms with the IM aripiprazole depot 400/300 mg compared to 
oral  aripiprazole  10-30  mg  and  increasing  incidence  over  treatment  duration  ,  the  PRAC  and  CHMP 
agreed  for  a  post-authorization  safety  study  (PASS)  to  further  investigate  this  known  safety  concern 
with this specific formulation. The CHMP also noted that further data from the long term safety study 
31-10-270 will be collected to monitor this safety concern. 
Safety  data  on  drug  interactions  are  derived  from  the  oral  aripiprazole  marketing  authorisation.  Both 
efficacy  studies 
(31-04-247  and  31-04-246)  excluded 
the  concomitant  use  of  CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers  and  CYP2D6  at  all  phases.  Given  the  pharmacokinetic  findings  (see  2.4.2),  the 
CHMP  agreed  with  the  proposed  dosing  reduction  in  case  of  concomitant  use  of    strong  CYP3A4 
inhibitors  or  strong  CYP2D6  inhibitors  and  in  poor  CYP2D6  poor  CYP2D6  metabolisers.  In  case  of 
adverse  reactions  despite  dose  adjustments  of  Abilify  Maintena,  the  necessity  of  concomitant  use  of 
CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor should be reassessed. 
The  only  serious  TEAEs  reported  for  >  1%  of  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  subjects  were 
schizophrenia  and  psychotic  disorder  in  both  analysed  datasets.  These  events  were  considered  to  be 
associated with the underlying psychotic disorder and no specific concerns were raised in this regard. 
During  the  evaluation,  the  CHMP  requested  additional  information  on  reports  of  inadvertent  injection 
into  a  blood  vessel,  a  possible  risk  with  IM  depot  preparations.  While  no  cases  were  reported  in  the 
clinical studies, the CHMP recommended to include a precautionary SmPC statement in section 4.9 to 
ensure close monitoring in such situation. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  safety  profile  of  IM  aripiprazole  depot  did  not  raise  any  new 
concern,  with  the  exception  of  local  injection  site  reactions  and  this  is  reflected  accordingly  in  the 
SmPC.  The proposed legal status is “medicinal product subject to medical prescription” and no further 
restrictions were recommended by the CHMP. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based  on  the  data  collected  to  date,  the  safety  profile  of  IM  aripiprazole  depot  appeared  favourable 
and similar to that of oral aripiprazole. From the safety database, all the adverse reactions reported in 
clinical trials and postmarketing (for oral aripiprazole only) have been included in the SmPC. 
As detailed in the risk management plan, the CHMP considers and agreed to the pharmacovigilance 
plans as described below in section 2.8. :

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 8.2 the PRAC considers by consensus 
decision  that  the  risk  management  system  for  Aripiprazole  (Abilify  Maintena)  in  the  maintenance 
treatment of schizophrenia in adults, could be acceptable provided an updated risk management plan 
is submitted with the following changes: 
-  Leukopenia  is  considered  to  be  an  important  identified  risk  based  on  clinical  data,  where  the 
incidence of IM depot related leukopenia was almost 3 times higher than what was observed in the oral 
route  (2.3%  vs.  0.8%).  There  seems  to  be  a  different  risk  incidence  related  to  this  particular 
formulation.  Leukopenia should be included as important identified risk. 
-  a  finalised  protocol  of  “Extrapyramidal  symptoms  in  patients  treated  with  Abilify  Maintena:  Cohort 
study  with  a  2-year  follow-up  using  European  longitudinal  electronic  medical  records  or  claims 
databases” should be submitted within 2 months. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The applicant amended the RMP accordingly and the revised RMP was agreed by the CHMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Oral aripiprazole has been on the market for several years in the treatment of schizophrenia in adults, 
and  has  a  well  characterised  efficacy  and  safety  profile.  The  present  application  relates  to  the  depot 
preparation  of  aripiprazole  intended  to  be  used  as  a  possible  maintenance  treatment  option  for  adult 
patients  with  schizophrenia  and  suggested  to  improve  treatment  adherence  and  compliance  with  a 
proposed monthly administration instead of daily oral intake. Such treatment option may be considered 
as  an  important  medical  need  given  its  potential  association  with  improved  long  term  outcomes  for 
patients with schizophrenia. 
In  an  adequately  designed  pivotal  study  31-07-247,  non-inferiority  of  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400 
mg/300  mg  to  oral  aripiprazole  tablets  10-30  mg  was  demonstrated  and  the  assay  sensitivity  was 
confirmed.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  experiencing  impending 
relapse.  The  estimated  relapse  rate  by  end  of  Week  26  was  7.12%  in  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400 
mg/300 mg group and 7.76% in the oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg group, a difference of −0.6%. 
The  95%  CI  (−5.26,  3.99)  for  the  difference  in  the  estimated  proportion  of  subjects  experiencing 
impending relapse by end of Week 26 excluded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 11.5%. 
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  time  to  impending  relapse,  was  similar  in  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot 
400 mg/300 mg group and the oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg group (log-rank test, p = 0.9920). 
The  risk  of  impending  relapse  was  similar  in  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group  as 
compared with the oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30  mg group (hazard ratio = 0.991, 95% CI = 0.545, 
1.803). The time to impending relapse was also statistically significantly delayed (ie, improved) in the 
aripiprazole  IM  depot  400  mg/300  mg  group  compared  with  the  aripiprazole  IM  depot  50  mg/25  mg 
group  (log-rank  test,  p  <  0.0001).  Other  secondary  results  were  also  consistent  with  the  primary 
efficacy  analysis  showing  stabilisation  of  the  psychotic  symptoms  in  patients  treated  with  IM 
aripiprazole depot 400mg/300 mg and suggested that lower dose was not efficacious in the proposed 
indication.    Moreover,  the  proportion  of  responders  was  statistically  significantly  higher  in  the 
aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg group than in the aripiprazole IM depot 50 mg/25 mg group (p 
= 0.0001). 
In the supportive study 31-07-246, the primary efficacy variable was the time to impending relapse in 
adult  subjects  with  schizophrenia  who  maintained  stability  for  at  least  12  consecutive  weeks  on 
aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg/300 mg. Results showed that time to impending relapse was significantly 
shorter  for  subjects  randomized  to  placebo  compared  with  subjects  randomized  to  aripiprazole  IM

depot  400  mg/300  mg  in  the  double  blind  maintenance  phase  (p  <  0.0001;  log-rank  test)  further 
supporting the primary efficacy analysis. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Both studies (31-07-247 and 31-07-246) included patients stabilised with oral aripiprazole, for at least 
8  weeks  in  study  31-07-247  and  up  to  12  weeks  in  study  31-07-246.    Whilst  overall,  the  CHMP 
considered that the patients included in the pivotal study 31-04-247 was sufficiently representative of 
the intended population, it is noted that no efficacy data are available for patients stabilised with oral 
aripiprazole for shorter time periods. 
Uncertainties in the dosing recommendation for CYP2D6 known poor metabolisers or concomitant users 
of  CYP3A4  inhibitors/inducers  and  CYP2D6  inhibitors  subject  to  higher  exposure  were  identified  and 
have been adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
No new safety issues have been identified in preclinical studies conducted with IM aripiprazole depot as 
compared  to  oral  aripiprazole,  with  the  exception  of  local  injection  site  reactions.  Local  injection  site 
reactions were confirmed in clinical trials, in particular injection site pain  
Furthermore,  the  incidence  of  leukopenia-related  events  (low  WBC)  was  almost  3  times  higher  than 
what  was  observed  in  the  oral  route  (2.3%  vs.  0.8%)  in  the  pivotal  study.  There  seems  to  be  a 
different risk incidence related to this particular formulation. Therefore, leukopenia is considered as an 
important identified risk in addition to the other important identified/potential risks already existing for 
the  oral  aripiprazole  (EPS  and  tardive  dyskinesia,  NMS;  seizures,  hyperglycemia/diabetes,  suicide-
related event, orthostatic hypotension and dyslipidemia). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Data  are  expected  to  be  collected  via  a  post-authorization  safety  study  (PASS)  to  further  investigate 
EPS given the higher frequency of EPS symptoms observed with the IM aripiprazole depot 400/300 mg 
as compared to the oral route, and increasing incidence over treatment duration. In addition, the long 
term open label safety study 31-10-270 is ongoing and should generate additional data with respect to 
this observation. 
Elderly population was not studied. This is considered as missing information in the Risk Management 
Plan. 
Pregnancies were reported during the clinical studies. Based on preclinical findings and limited clinical 
data,  IM  aripiprazole  depot  profile  in  this  population  is  considered  not  fully  characterised  and  the 
product  should  only  be  used  during  pregnancy  after  careful  assessment  of  the  benefit-risk  profile  in 
this  population  and  considering  the  long-acting  properties  of  the  product.  Use  in  pregnancy  is 
considered as missing information in the Risk Management Plan.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The non inferiority of IM aripiprazole depot versus oral aripiprazole was demonstrated in the proposed 
dosing regimen in patients orally stabilized with aripiprazole for a sufficient long term period (at least 8 
weeks). The only new safety issues as compared to oral aripiprazole of importance were the injection 
pain. Although these might affect the adherence to treatment, they were considered to be manageable 
with routine pharmacovigilance. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Having considered the benefits of this new depot formulation (aripiprazole) over the limited new risks 
identified as compared to the oral aripiprazole, already approved in the treatment of schizophrenia, the 
CHMP concluded that the benefit-risk balance for Abilify Maintena is positive with the following 
indication: 
“Abilify Maintena is indicated for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients stabilised 
with oral aripiprazole.” 
4. Recommendations 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus 
that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Abilify  Maintena  in  the  “maintenance  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in 
adult patients stabilised with oral aripiprazole” is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of 
the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

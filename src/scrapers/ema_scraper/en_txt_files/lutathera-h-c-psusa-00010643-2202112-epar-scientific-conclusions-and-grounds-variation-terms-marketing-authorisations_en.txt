Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide, 
the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of the available data on hypersensitivity reactions from a cumulative review of hypersensitivity 
and anaphylactic reactions from post-marketing sources, the PRAC concluded that the product 
information of products containing lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide should be amended accordingly. 
In view of the available data on angioedema from one case with positive rechallenge, the PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide should be 
amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

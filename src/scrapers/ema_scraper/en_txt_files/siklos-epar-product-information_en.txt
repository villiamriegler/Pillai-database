CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Siklos is indicated for the prevention of recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crises including acute chest 
syndrome in adults, adolescents and children older than 2 years suffering from symptomatic sickle cell 
syndrome (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Siklos should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of patients 
with sickle cell syndrome. 
Posology 
In adults, adolescents and children older than 2 years 
The posology should be based on the patient’s body weight (b.w.). 
The starting dose of hydroxycarbamide is 15 mg/kg b.w. and the usual dose is between 15 and 
30 mg/kg b.w./day.  
As long as the patient responds to therapy either clinically or haematologically (e.g. increase in 
haemoglobin F (HbF), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), decrease in neutrophil count), the dose of 
Siklos should be maintained. 
In case of non-response (re-occurrence of crises or lack of reduction in crisis rate), the daily dose may 
be increased by steps of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg b.w./day using the most appropriate strength. 
Under exceptional circumstances a maximum dose of 35 mg/kg b.w./day may be justified under close 
haematological monitoring (see section 4.4). 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the patient does not respond to the maximum dose of hydroxycarbamide (35 mg/kg b.w./day) given 
over three to six months, permanent discontinuation of Siklos should be considered. 
If blood counts are within the toxic range, Siklos should be temporarily discontinued until blood 
counts recover. Haematological recovery usually occurs within two weeks. Treatment may then be 
reinstated at a reduced dose. The dose of Siklos may then be increased again under close 
haematological monitoring. A dose producing haematological toxicity should not be tried more than 
two times. 
The toxic range may be characterised by the following results of blood tests: 
Neutrophils 
Platelets   
Haemoglobin 
Reticulocytes 
< 1 500/mm3 
< 80 000/mm3 
< 4.5 g/dL 
< 80 000/mm3 if the haemoglobin concentration < 9 g/dL 
Long-term data on the continued use of hydroxycarbamide in patients with sickle cell syndrome are 
available in children and adolescents, with a follow-up of 12 years in children and adolescents and 
over 13 years in adults. It is currently unknown how long patients should be treated with Siklos. The 
duration of treatment is the responsibility of the prescribing physician and should be based on the 
clinical and haematological status of each patient. 
Special populations 
Children less than 2 years of age 
The safety and efficacy of hydroxycarbamide in children from birth up to 2 years have not yet been 
established. Limited data suggest that 20 mg/kg/d reduced painful episodes and were safe in children 
less than 2 years of age but safety of long-term treatment remains to be established. Therefore no 
recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Renal impairment 
As renal excretion is a main pathway of elimination, a dose reduction of Siklos should be considered in 
patients with renal impairment. In patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min, the initial Siklos dose 
should be decreased by 50%. Close monitoring of blood parameters is advised in these patients. Siklos 
must not be administered to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) 
(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
There are no data that support specific dose adjustments in patients with hepatic impairment. Close 
monitoring of blood parameters is advised in these patients. Due to safety considerations, Siklos is 
contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  
Method of administration 
Conforming to the individual prescribed dose, the tablet or the half or quarter of the tablet should be 
taken once daily, preferably in the morning before breakfast and, when necessary, with a glass of 
water or a very small amount of food. 
For patients who are not able to swallow the tablets, these can be disintegrated immediately before 
use in a small quantity of water in a teaspoon. Adding a drop of syrup or mixing with food can mask a 
possible bitter taste. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. 
Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification C). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). 
Toxic ranges of myelosuppression as described in section 4.2. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Bone marrow depression 
Treatment with Siklos requires close clinical monitoring. The haematological status of the patient, as 
well as renal and hepatic functions should be determined prior to, and repeatedly during treatment. 
During treatment with Siklos, blood counts must be monitored once a month at treatment initiation 
(i.e. for the first two months) and if the daily dose of hydroxycarbamide is up to 35 mg/kg b.w. 
Patients who are stable on lower doses should be monitored every 2 months. 
Treatment with Siklos should be discontinued if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. 
Neutropenia is generally the first and most common manifestation of haematological suppression. 
Thrombocytopenia and anaemia occur less frequently, and are rarely seen without preceding 
neutropenia. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is discontinued. Siklos 
therapy can then be re-initiated at a lower dose (see section 4.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Siklos should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see section 
4.2). 
Since there are limited data in patients with mild to moderate liver impairment, Siklos should be used 
with caution (see section 4.2). 
Leg ulcers and cutaneous vasculitis toxicities 
In patients with leg ulcers, Siklos should be used with caution. Leg ulcers are a common complication 
of sickle cell syndrome, but have also been reported in patients treated with hydroxycarbamide. 
Cutaneous vasculitic toxicities, including vasculitic ulcerations and gangrene, have occurred in 
patients with myeloproliferative disorders during therapy with hydroxycarbamide. These vasculitic 
toxicities were reported most often in patients with a history of, or currently receiving, interferon 
therapy. Due to potentially severe clinical outcomes for the cutaneous vasculitic ulcers reported in 
patients with myeloproliferative disease, hydroxycarbamide should be discontinued and/or its dose 
reduced if cutaneous vasculitic ulcerations develop. Rarely, ulcers are caused by leukocytoclastic 
vasculitis. 
Macrocytosis 
Hydroxycarbamide causes macrocytosis, which may mask the incidental development of folic acid 
and vitamin B12 deficiency. Prophylactic administration of folic acid is recommended. 
Carcinogenicity 
Hydroxycarbamide is unequivocally genotoxic in a wide range of test systems. Hydroxycarbamide is 
presumed to be a transspecies carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxycarbamide for 
myeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukaemia has been reported. It is unknown whether this 
leukaemogenic effect is secondary to hydroxycarbamide or is associated with the patient’s underlying 
disease. Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxycarbamide. 
Safe administration and monitoring 
Patients and/or parents or the legal responsible person must be able to follow directions regarding the 
administration of this medicinal product, their monitoring and care. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Specific interaction studies have not been performed with hydroxycarbamide. 
Potentially fatal pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, and severe peripheral neuropathy have been reported 
in HIV-infected patients who received hydroxycarbamide in combination with first generation 
antiretroviral medicinal products, particularly didanosine plus stavudine. Patients treated with 
hydroxycarbamide in combination with didanosine, stavudine, and indinavir showed a median decline 
in CD4 cells of approximately 100/mm3. 
Concurrent use of hydroxycarbamide and other myelosuppressive medicinal products or radiation 
therapy may increase bone marrow depression, gastro-intestinal disturbances or mucositis. An 
erythema caused by radiation therapy may be aggravated by hydroxycarbamide. 
Concomitant use of hydroxycarbamide with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the 
vaccine virus and/or may increase the adverse reaction of the vaccine virus, because normal defence 
mechanisms may be suppressed by hydroxycarbamide therapy. Vaccination with a live vaccine in a 
patient taking hydroxycarbamide may result in severe infections. Generally, the patient's antibody 
response to vaccines may be decreased. Treatment with Siklos and concomitant immunisation with 
live virus vaccines should only be performed if benefits clearly outweigh potential risks. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females  
Women of childbearing age receiving hydroxycarbamide should be advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant, and to inform the treating physician immediately should this occur. 
An effective method of contraception is strongly recommended in women of childbearing potential. 
Male and female patients on hydroxycarbamide wishing to conceive should stop treatment 3 to 6 
months before pregnancy if possible. The evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio should be made on an 
individual basis taking into consideration the respective risk of hydroxycarbamide therapy against the 
switch to a blood transfusion programme.  
Pregnancy  
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients on hydroxycarbamide 
should be made aware of the risks to the foetus. 
There is limited amount of data from the use of hydroxycarbamide in pregnant women. Siklos is not 
recommended during pregnancy. 
The patient should be instructed to immediately contact a doctor in case of suspected pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding  
Hydroxycarbamide is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in 
infants, breastfeeding must be discontinued while taking Siklos. 
Fertility  
Fertility in males might be affected by treatment. Very common reversible oligo- and azoospermia 
have been observed in man, although these disorders are also associated with the underlying disease. 
Impaired fertility was observed in male rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Siklos has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to 
drive or operate machines, if dizziness is experienced while taking Siklos. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety profile of hydroxycarbamide in sickle cell syndrome was established from clinical trials 
and confirmed with long-term cohort studies including up to 1 903 adults and children of more than 2 
years of age. 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction is myelosuppression with neutropenia as the most 
common manifestation. Bone marrow depression is the dose-limiting toxic effect of 
hydroxycarbamide. When the maximum tolerated dose is not reached, transient myelotoxicity usually 
occurs in less than 10% of patients, while under the maximum tolerated dose more than 50% can 
experience reversible bone marrow suppression. These adverse reactions are expected based on the 
pharmacology of hydroxycarbamide. Gradual dose titration may help diminish these effects (see 
section 4.2).  
The clinical data obtained in patients with sickle cell syndrome have not shown evidence of adverse 
reactions of hydroxycarbamide on hepatic and renal function. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are 
defined as very common (>1/10), common (>1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (>1/1 000 to <1/100), rare 
(>1/10 000 to <1/1 000), very rare (<1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing

Weight gain5 
1 Haematological recovery usually occurs within two weeks of withdrawal of hydroxycarbamide.  
2 The macrocytosis caused by hydroxycarbamide is not vitamin B12 or folic acid dependent. 
3 Mainly due to infection with Parvovirus, splenic or hepatic sequestration, renal impairment.

4 Oligospermia and azoospermia are in general reversible but have to be taken into account when 
fatherhood is desired (see section 5.3). These disorders are also associated with the underlying 
disease. 
5 Weight gain may be an effect of improved general conditions. 
Pediatric population 
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children is generally similar to adults. 
Postmarketing data from one observational study with Siklos® (Escort HU) on a large set of patients 
(n=1 906) with sickle cell disease showed that patients aged 2 to 10 years were at higher risk for 
neutropenia and at lower risk for dry skin, alopecia, headache and anaemia. Patients aged 10 to 18 
years were at lower risk for dry skin, skin ulcer, alopecia, weight increase and anaemia compared to 
adults.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V 
4.9  Overdose 
Acute mucocutaneous toxicity has been reported in patients receiving hydroxycarbamide at doses  
several times above the therapeutic dose. Soreness, violet erythema, oedema on palms and soles 
followed by scaling of hand and feet, severe generalised hyperpigmentation of the skin and stomatitis 
have been observed. 
In patients with sickle cell syndrome, severe bone marrow depression was reported in isolated cases of 
hydroxycarbamide overdose between 2 and 10 times the prescribed dose (up to 8.57 times of the 
maximum recommended dose of 35 mg/kg b.w./day). It is recommended that blood counts are 
monitored for several weeks after overdose since recovery may be delayed. 
Treatment of overdose consists of gastric lavage, followed by symptomatic treatment and control of 
bone marrow function. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX05. 
Mechanism of action 
All mechanisms of action of hydroxycarbamide are not fully understood. One of the mechanisms is the 
increase in foetal haemoglobin (HbF) concentrations in sickle cell patients. HbF interferes with the 
polymerisation of HbS and thus impedes the sickling of red blood cell and in turn decreases 
vasocclusion and haemolysis. In all clinical studies, there was a significant increase in HbF from 
baseline after hydroxycarbamide use. Increased HbF also increases red blood cell survival and total 
haemoglobin level and thus reduces anaemia in these patients. 
Hydroxycarbamide has shown to be associated with the generation of nitric oxide suggesting that 
nitric oxide stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphatase (cGMP) production, which then activates a 
protein kinase and increases the production of HbF. Other known pharmacological effects of 
hydroxycarbamide which may contribute to its beneficial effects in sickle cell syndrome include 
decrease in neutrophils, increase in water content of red blood cells, increased deformability of sickled 
cells, and altered adhesion of red blood cells to the endothelium. 
In addition hydroxycarbamide causes an immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis by acting as a 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, without interfering with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or protein. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Beside the inconstant correlation between reduction of crisis rate and the increase in HbF, the 
cytoreductive effect of hydroxycarbamide, particularly the decrease in neutrophils, was the factor with 
the strongest correlation with the reduction in crisis rate. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In nearly all clinical studies conducted in sickle cell syndrome, hydroxycarbamide reduced the 
frequency of vaso-occlusive episodes by 40% to 80%, in children and in adults. The same decrease 
was observed for the number of hospital admissions and the number of days of hospitalisation in the 
treated groups. The yearly frequency of acute chest syndrome (ACS) was also reduced by 25 to 68% 
under hydroxycarbamide in several studies. Acute chest syndrome is a frequent life-threatening 
complication of sickle cell syndrome and is characterised by chest pain or fever or dyspnoea with 
recent infiltrate on chest X-ray. 
A sustained clinical benefit was demonstrated in patients remaining on hydroxycarbamide treatment 
for more than 8 years.  
In 1 906 patients included in the cohort study ESCORT HU, after twelve and twenty-four months of 
treatment with hydroxycarbamide and compared to the baseline, it was observed a significant increase 
of Hb level (+1.4 g/dL and 1.5 g/dL) and percentage of HbF (+14.65% and 15%). In parallel after one 
year of treatment there was a significant reduction of the number of painful crises lasting >48 h (-40% 
in children and -50% in adults), episodes of ACS (-68% in children and -57% in adults), and 
hospitalizations (-44% in children and -45% in adults) and the percentage of patients requiring blood 
transfusion decreased by 50% The safety profile of hydroxycarbamide in adults and in children 
observed in ESCORT-HU was consistent with previous published data with no new risk 
(Montalembert 2021). 
Paediatric population 
In NOHARM trial (Opoka 2017) children of mean age of 2.2 years old (from 1 to 3.99 years) were 
randomized to either hydroxycarbamide (n=104) or placebo (n=104). Treatment was administered 
once daily at 20 ± 2.5 mg/kg for 12 months. A composite SCD-related clinical outcome (vaso-
occlusive painful crisis, dactylitis, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, or blood transfusion) 
was less frequent with hydroxyurea (45%) than placebo (69%, p=0.001). Regarding the risk of 
increased infection in children with drug-induced neutropenia, it was rare in NOHARM and did not 
differ on hydroxyurea versus placebo treatment. 
At the end of the NOHARM trial, children were enrolled in the NOHARM extension trial (John 2020), 
and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to receive hydroxycarbamide at a fixed standard dose 
(mean [±SD], 20±5 mg per kilogram per day) or to escalate hydroxycarbamide to the maximum 
tolerated dose. 187 children were randomized: 94 (age 4.6 ± 1.0) in the fixed dose group (19.2±1.8 mg 
/kg/d) and 93 (age 4.8 ± 0.9) in the dose escalation group (29.5±3.6 mg/kg/d). After 18 months, an 
increase in Hb level (+0.3 g/dL) and % HbF (+8%) was found in the escalation group.  
Clinical adverse events of any grade were more frequent in the fixed-dose group, including all sickle 
cell–related events (245 vs 105) and specific events: vaso-occlusive pain crisis (200 vs 86) and acute 
chest syndrome or pneumonia (30 vs 8). The number of key medical interventions were also fewer in 
the dose-escalation group than in the fixed-dose group, both for transfusions (34 vs. 116) and 
hospitalizations (19 vs. 90).  
In infants with SS/Sb0 aged 9–23 months, a decrease of episodes of pain (-52%, 177 events vs 375), 
dactylitis (- 80%, 24 vs 123), acute chest syndrome (8 vs 27) and hospitalizations (- 28%, 232 vs 324) 
has been reported with hydroxycarbamide (n=96) compared to placebo (n=97) respectively in the 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
randomized controlled trial Baby Hug. In 25 patients treated for 1 year in the uncontrolled ESCORT 
HU over 1 year, compared to 1 year prior to enrolment (n=25), reduction of vaso-occlusive crises: -
42% and hospitalizations: -55%.  
The benefit risk ratio and long-term safety remain to be established in this population. 
In the uncontrolled cohort ESCORT HU, a subset of 27 pediatric patients with severe chronic anemia, 
treated with Siklos for 12 months, had haemoglobin levels less than 7 g/dL at baseline. Of these, only 
6 (22%) patients had levels less than 7 g/dL at Month 12. While there have been a majority of patients 
(56%) who had a change from baseline equal to or exceeding 1 g/dL, due to the large proportion of 
missing data, potential for regression to the mean and that an effect of transfusions could not be 
excluded, no robust efficacy conclusions can be made from this uncontrolled study. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption  
After oral administration of 20 mg/kg of hydroxycarbamide, a rapid absorption is observed with peak 
plasma levels of about 30 mg/L occurring after 0.75 and 1.2 h in children and adult patients with sickle 
cell syndrome, respectively. The total exposure up to 24 h post-dose is 124 mg.h/L in children and 
adolescents and 135 mg.h/L in adult patients. The oral bioavailability of hydroxycarbamide is almost 
complete as assessed in indications other than sickle cell syndrome. 
Distribution  
Hydroxycarbamide distributes rapidly throughout the human body, enters the cerebrospinal fluid, 
appears in peritoneal fluid and ascites, and concentrates in leukocytes and erythrocytes. The estimated 
volume of distribution of hydroxycarbamide approximates total body water. The volume of 
distribution at steady state adjusted for bioavailability is 0.57 L/kg in patients with sickle cell 
syndrome (amounting to approximately 72 and 90 L in children and adults, respectively). The extent 
of protein binding of hydroxycarbamide is unknown. 
Biotransformation  
The biotransformation pathways as well as the metabolites are not fully characterised. Urea is one 
metabolite of hydroxycarbamide. 
Hydroxycarbamide at 30, 100 and 300 µM is not metabolised in vitro by cytochrome P450s of human 
liver microsomes. At concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 µM, hydroxycarbamide does not 
stimulate the in vitro ATPase activity of recombinant human P glycoprotein (PGP), indicating that 
hydroxycarbamide is not a PGP substrate. Hence, no interaction is to be expected in case of 
concomitant administration with substances being substrates of cytochromes P450 or P-glycoprotein. 
Elimination  
In a repeated dose study in adult patients with sickle cell syndrome approximately 60% of the 
hydroxycarbamide dose was detected in urine at steady state. In adults, the total clearance adjusted for 
bioavailability was 9.89 L/h (0.16 L/h/kg) thereof 5.64 and 4.25 L/h by renal and non-renal clearance, 
respectively. The respective value for total clearance in children was 7.25 L/h (0.20 L/h/kg) with 2.91 
and 4.34 L/h by renal and non-renal pathways. 
In adults with sickle cell syndrome, mean cumulative urinary hydroxycarbamide excretion was 62% of 
the administered dose at 8 hours, and thus higher than in cancer patients (35–40%). In patients with 
sickle cell syndrome hydroxycarbamide was eliminated with a half-life of approximately six to seven 
hours, which is longer than reported in other indications. 
Geriatric, gender, race  
No information is available regarding pharmacokinetic differences due to age (except paediatric 
patients), gender or race. 
Paediatric population  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In paediatric and adult patients with sickle cell syndrome the systemic exposure to hydroxycarbamide 
at steady state was similar by means of the area under the curve. The maximum plasma levels and the 
apparent volume of distribution related to body weight were well comparable between age groups. The 
time to reach maximum plasma concentration and the percentage of the dose excreted in urine were 
increased in children compared to adults. In paediatric patients, the half-life was slightly longer and 
the total clearance related to body weight slightly higher than in adult patients (see section 4.2).  
Renal impairment  
As renal excretion is a pathway of elimination, consideration should be given to decreasing the dose of 
Siklos in patients with renal impairment. In an open single-dose study in adult patients with sickle cell 
syndrome (Yan JH et al, 2005) the influence of renal function on pharmacokinetics of 
hydroxycarbamide was assessed. Patients with normal (creatinine clearance CrCl>80 mL/min), mild 
(CrCl 60–80 mL/min), moderate (CrCl 30 - 60 mL/min), or severe (<30 mL/min) renal impairment 
received hydroxycarbamide as a single dose of 15 mg/kg b.w. by using 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg 
capsules. In patients, whose CrCl was below 60 mL/min or patients with end-stage renal disease the 
mean exposure to hydroxycarbamide was approximately 64% higher than in patients with normal 
renal function. As evaluated in a further study, in patients with a CrCl<60 mL/min the area under the 
curve was approximately 51% higher than in patients with a CrCl ≥60 mL/min, which suggests that a 
dose reduction of hydroxycarbamide by 50% may be appropriate in patients with a CrCl < 60 mL/min. 
Haemodialysis reduced the exposure to hydroxycarbamide by 33% (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Close monitoring of blood parameters is advised in these patients. 
Hepatic impairment  
There are no data that support specific guidance for dose adjustment in patients with hepatic 
impairment, but, due to safety considerations, Siklos is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.3). Close monitoring of blood parameters is advised in patients with hepatic 
impairment.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In preclinical toxicity studies the most common effects noted included bone marrow depression, 
lymphoid atrophy and degenerative changes in the epithelium of the small and large intestines. 
Cardiovascular effects and haematological changes were observed in some species. Also, in rats 
testicular atrophy with decreased spermatogenesis occurred, while in dogs reversible spermatogenic 
arrest was noted. 
Hydroxycarbamide is unequivocally genotoxic in a wide range of test systems. 
Conventional long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydroxycarbamide have not 
been performed. However, hydroxycarbamide is presumed to be a transspecies carcinogen. 
Hydroxycarbamide crosses the placenta barrier and has been demonstrated to be a potent teratogen and 
embryotoxic in a wide variety of animal models at or below the human therapeutic dose. 
Teratogenicity was characterised by partially ossified cranial bones, absence of eye sockets, 
hydrocephaly, bipartite sternebrae, missing lumbar vertebrae. Embryotoxicity was characterized by 
decreased foetal viability, reduced live litter sizes, and developmental delays. 
Hydroxycarbamide administered to male rats at 60 mg/kg b.w./day (about double the recommended 
usual maximum dose in humans) produced testicular atrophy, decreased spermatogenesis and 
significantly reduced their ability to impregnate females.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Siklos is and what it is used for 
Siklos is used to prevent painful crises, including sudden chest pain, caused by sickle cell disease, in 
adults, adolescents and children older than 2 years.  
Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects the disc shaped red cells of the blood.  
Some cells become abnormal, rigid and take a crescent or sickle shape which leads to anemia. 
The sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow. This can cause acute pain crises 
and organ damage. 
For  severe  painful  crises,  most  patients  require  hospitalisation.  Siklos  will  decrease  the  number  of 
painful crises as well as the need for hospitalisation linked with the disease.  
The active substance of Siklos, hydroxycarbamide, is a substance which inhibits growth and 
proliferation of some cells, such as blood cells. These effects lead to a reduction of circulating red, 
white and coagulation blood cells (myelosuppressive effect). In sickle cell disease, hydroxycarbamide 
helps also to prevent red blood cells from taking abnormal shape. 
2. 
What you need to know before you take Siklos 
Do not take Siklos 
- 
if you are allergic to hydroxycarbamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6), 
if you suffer from severe liver disease, 
if you suffer from severe kidney disease, 
if you are myelosuppressed (if you have decreased production of red, white, or coagulating 
blood cells) as described in section 3 “How to take Siklos, Treatment follow-up”, 
if you are breast-feeding (see section “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility”).

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before taking Siklos 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have a liver disease, 
if you have a kidney disease, 
if you have leg ulcers, 
if you are taking other myelosuppressive medicines (decrease production of red, white, or 
coagulating blood cells) or receiving radiation therapy, 
if you have a known lack of vitamin B12 or folate. 
If you experience (or have experienced) any of the above, please tell your doctor. If you have any 
question, please ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. 
Patients and/or parents or the legal responsible person must be able to follow directions regarding the 
administration of this medicine, their monitoring and care. 
Other medicines and Siklos 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Information sharing is especially required for 
- 
some antiretroviral medicines (those that inhibit or destroy a retrovirus such as HIV), e.g. 
didanosine, stavudine and indinavir (a drop in your white cell count may occur), 
-  myelosuppressive medicines (those that decrease production of red, white, or coagulating blood 
cells) and radiation therapy, 
some vaccines. 
- 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Siklos is not recommended during pregnancy. Please contact your doctor immediately if you think you 
may be pregnant. The use of effective contraception is strongly recommended. 
If you become pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking Siklos, your doctor will discuss with 
you the potential benefits and risks of continuing using Siklos.  
For male patients taking Siklos, if your partner becomes pregnant or plans to become pregnant, your 
doctor will discuss with you the potential benefits and risks of continuing using Siklos. 
The active substance of Siklos passes into human breast-milk. You must not breast-feed while taking 
Siklos. 
Hydroxycarbamide may decrease sperm production in male patients while they are being treated. 
Driving and using machines 
Some people may experience dizziness when using Siklos. Do not drive or use any tools or machines if 
you experience dizziness whilst taking Siklos. 
3. 
How to take Siklos 
Always take Siklos exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you 
are not sure. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose 
Your doctor will tell you how much of Siklos to take each day and will describe the dose in 
whole, half or quarter tablets. 
The prescribed dose of Siklos must be taken once daily, preferably in the morning before breakfast.  
It can be taken with a glass of water or a very small amount of food. 
If you cannot swallow the tablets, you can disintegrate them in water immediately before use: 
•  Place the required dose (preferably broken if Siklos 1 000 mg tablet is used) in a teaspoon and add 
some water. 
•  As soon as the tablet is disintegrated, swallow the content of the teaspoon. You can add a drop of 
syrup or mix the content with food to mask a possible bitter taste. 
•  Then drink a large glass of water or any other drink. 
Handling 
Siklos is a cytotoxic medicine that must be handled with care. 
Any person, in particular pregnant women, who are not taking Siklos should avoid direct contact with 
the parts when breaking a tablet. Wash your hands before and after contact with the tablets. 
In case the prescribed dose requires breaking the tablet in halves or quarters, this should be done out of 
the reach of food. Powder spilled from the broken tablet should be wiped up with a damp disposable 
towel which must be thrown out. For the storage of unused broken tablets, see section 5 “How to store 
Siklos”. 
Treatment follow-up 
Your doctor will tell you how long to take Siklos. 
When taking Siklos you will have regular blood tests and check your liver and kidney. 
Depending on the dose you take, these tests may be performed monthly or every two months.  
Depending on these results your doctor will adjust your dose of Siklos. 
If you take more Siklos than you should 
If you take more Siklos than you should or if a child has taken any, contact your doctor or the nearest 
hospital immediately as you may need urgent medical treatment. The most common symptoms of 
overdose with Siklos are: 
Redness of the skin, 
- 
Soreness (touch is painful) and swelling of the palms of hands and soles of feet followed by the 
- 
hands and feet becoming scaly, 
Skin becoming strongly pigmented (locally changes of colour), 
Soreness or swelling in the mouth.

the next dose as prescribed by your doctor. 
If you stop taking Siklos 
Do not stop your treatment unless advised by your doctor. 
If you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

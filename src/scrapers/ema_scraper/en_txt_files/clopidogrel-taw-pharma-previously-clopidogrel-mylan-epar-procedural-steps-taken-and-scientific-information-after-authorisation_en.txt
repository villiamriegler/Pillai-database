SmPC, 
The safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been 
Labelling and 
demonstrated by several large clinical studies. No literature 
PL 
review on the efficacy/effectiveness has been submitted by 
the MAH within this application. Since the clinical efficacy of 
clopidogrel in the approved indications is well established 
and evidence of clinical efficacy has been discussed at time 
of approval the CHMP finds acceptable the MAH approach of 
not performing a literature review on the 
efficacy/effectiveness of clopidogrel. 
The beneficial effect of Clopidogrel Mylan remains in line 
with that of the originator product (Plavix), and is 
considered positive.

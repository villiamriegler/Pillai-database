1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Roche Registration GmbH 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 24 May 2018 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

Update of sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC of Tecentriq in order to restrict the indication ‘for the 
treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who are 
considered cisplatin ineligible’ to those patients ‘whose tumours have a PDL-1 expression ≥ 5% (see 
section 5.1). This restriction is based on the review of interim analysis data by the independent data 
monitoring committee (IDMC) from study IMvigor 130 (WO30070). This is a Phase III, multicentre, 
randomized, placebo-controlled study of atezolizumab administered as monotherapy or in combination 
with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with 
untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma enrolling patients in the first line setting 
who are both cisplatin eligible and cisplatin ineligible currently listed as a post authorisation efficacy 
study (PAES) in the Annex II. The MAH is proposing to distribute a DHPC. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.  Introduction 
The CHMP has been informed by the MAH for Tecentriq (Atezolizumab) that on 19 March 2018, the 
IDMC for Study IMvigor130 met for an ad-hoc closed session scheduled at their request. Based on the 
review of data from a snapshot dated 12 March 2018, and meeting discussion, the IDMC 
recommended the following to the Sponsor Data Review Board (DRB): 
“Based on review of survival data in all patients randomized to date, the DMC recommends closure of 
Arm B (Atezo alone) to further accrual for all patients whose tumours are IC0 or IC1 for PD-L1. 
Patients who have tumours that are IC2/3 can continue to be randomized to Arms A, B or C. Arms A 
and C should remain unchanged (open to all eligible patients irrespective of their PD-L1 status).” 
This recommendation was accepted by the Sponsor’s DRB on 26 March 2018. After further follow up (5 
April 2018), IDMC provided additional clarification on two points: 1) to implement their 
recommendation using a mechanism that minimises the number of patients with IC0 or IC1 tumours 
randomized to Arm B (atezolizumab monotherapy); and 2) they do not recommend a change of 
therapy for patients already randomized on study.  
The Sponsor remains blinded to all IMvigor130 data reviewed by the IDMC and has only been provided 
the IDMC recommendations.   
The IMvigor130 study is stated in the EC decision as an Annex II condition under section D “Obligation 
to conduct post-authorisation measures” which defines study IMvigor130 as a PAES.

Considering the above, the MAH submitted a variation to restrict the indication for the Tecentriq 
monotherapy of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC). 
3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
3.1.  Introduction 
The proposed change follows the review of survival data by the independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (iDMC) of study IMvigor130 in an ad-hoc meeting on 19th March 2018. IMvigor130 
(WO30070) is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study of atezolizumab 
administered as monotherapy or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with 
platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma enrolling patients in the first line setting who are both cisplatin eligible and cisplatin 
ineligible:    
  Arm  A  [atezolizumab  in  combination  with  platinum-based  chemotherapy  (cisplatin  or 
carboplatin) and gemcitabine],  
  Arm B (atezolizumab monotherapy) or  
  Arm  C  [placebo  in  combination  with  platinum-based  chemotherapy  (cisplatin  or  carboplatin) 
and gemcitabine] 
The IMvigor130 study is included as an Annex II condition under section D “Obligation to conduct post-
authorisation measures” which defines study IMvigor130 as a PAES in order to evaluate the efficacy of 
atezolizumab in terms of PFS and OS. The MAH was asked to conduct IMvigor 130, comparing 
atezolizumab monotherapy versus atezolizumab and carboplatin/gemcitabine or cisplatin/gemcitabine 
in untreated patients (cisplatin-ineligible and –eligible patients) as at the time of the initial approval of 
Tecentriq in 1L cisplatin-ineligible patients the overall response rate of atezolizumab compared less 
favourably to the best historical comparator of CarboGem (22.7% vs. 36.1%), responses were ongoing 
in 70% of patients with a median follow-up of 17.2 months (compared to 5.3 months for Carbo/Gem). 
In the 2L+ patients response rates in the same range as for chemotherapy were demonstrated 
consistently in 767 2L UC patients across IMvigor 210 and IMvigor 211. Duration of responses was 
substantially longer for treatment with atezolizumab (median DOR 21.7 vs. 7.4 months in the 
atezolizumab vs. control arm). OS data for atezolizumab were numerically superior to SOC for the 
overall study population and across all IC subgroups. The Kaplan-Meier OS curves showed a separation 
after approximately 7 months in favour of the atezolizumab monotherapy arm, and it was maintained 
thereafter suggesting a non-negligible clinical benefit for those patients that achieved a response. 
3.2.  Discussion - review of interim results of IMvigor130 
At the time of the initial approval of Tecentriq in the 1L cisplatin-ineligible the overall response rates of 
atezolizumab compared less favourably to the best historical comparator of CarboGem (22.7% vs. 
36.1%), responses were ongoing in 70% of patients with a median follow-up of 17.2 months 
(compared to 5.3 months for Carbo/Gem). The MAH was requested to conduct a PAES in order to 
evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab in terms of PFS and OS. The MAH was asked to submit the 
results of study IMvigor 130, a phase 3 randomised study comparing atezolizumab monotherapy or 
atezolizumab and carboplatin/gemcitabine with cisplatin/gemcitabine in untreated patients (cisplatin-
ineligible and –eligible patients).

On 19 March 2018, the IDMC for Study IMvigor130 met for an ad-hoc closed session scheduled at their 
request. Based on the review of data from a snapshot dated 12 March 2018, and meeting discussion, 
the IDMC recommended the following to the Sponsor Data Review Board (DRB): 
“Based on review of survival data in all patients randomized to date, the DMC recommends closure of 
Arm B (Atezo alone) to further accrual for all patients whose tumors are IC0 or IC1 for PD-L1. Patients 
who have tumors that are IC2/3 can continue to be randomized to Arms A, B or C. Arms A and C 
should remain unchanged (open to all eligible patients irrespective of their PD-L1 status).” 
The Sponsor, through a firewalled internal team that has been unblinded to the IMvigor130 data, has 
reviewed the results of the interim analysis on which the IMvigor130 iDMC based their 
recommendation. In the subgroup of patients whose tumours express low levels of PD-L1 (less than 
5% of immune cells staining for PD-L1), decreased overall survival was observed for the patients 
treated with atezolizumab monotherapy (Arm B) compared to the patients treated with the control 
treatment of platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm C). In the subgroup of patients whose tumours 
express high levels of PD-L1 (5% or greater immune cells staining positive for PD-L1 by 
immunohistochemistry) the interim results do not impact the current label. 
The MAH has appropriately distributed a Dear Investigator Letter (DIL) to all study sites and local 
health authorities. The DIL clearly describe the decision made by IDMC and the consequences it has.  
Overall, data show a lower OS in patients whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression < 5% . The lower 
efficacy cannot be attributed to higher rates of AE, SAEs or withdrawals, as the safety of atezolizumab 
in the monotherapy is as expected. Nor can the differences be attributed to differences in baseline 
characteristics. Tecentriq was approved in 1L cisplatin-ineligible patients based on single arm data. 
However, study IMvigor130 now provides comparative data that show a lower efficacy in patients that 
are either PD-L1 negative (IC0) or low expressers (IC1). Thus, a restriction of the indication to patients 
with PD-L1 expression ≥ 5% is warranted. 
Following the review of the data provided by the iDMC and the MAH, the CHMP agreed with the 
changes of section 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC to restrict the indication as follows:  
  Section 4.1 ‘Therapeutic indications’ 
Tecentriq  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC): 
 
after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy, or 
  who  are  considered  cisplatin  ineligible,  and  whose  tumours  have  a  PD-L1  expression  ≥  
5% (see section 5.1).  
  Section 4.2 ‘Posology and method of administration’ 
PD-L1 testing for patients with UC 
Patients with previously untreated UC should be selected for treatment based on the tumour 
expression of PD-L1 confirmed by a validated test (see section 5.1). 
  Section 5.1 ‘Pharmacodynamic properties’ 
IMvigor130 (WO30070): Phase III multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 
atezolizumab as monotherapy and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in 
patients with untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma

Based on an independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) recommendation following an 
early review of survival data, accrual of patients on the atezolizumab monotherapy 
treatment arm whose tumours have a low PD-L1 expression (less than 5% of immune cells 
staining positive for PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry) was stopped after observing 
decreased overall survival for this subgroup. The iDMC did not recommend any change of 
therapy for patients who had already been randomized to and were receiving treatment in 
the monotherapy arm.  
The Package Leaflet has also been updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
In addition, a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) is considered necessary in order 
to communicate on the restriction of indication after agreement of the translations local specificities of 
the DHPC with national competent authorities.  
The DHPC should be sent by 9 July 2018 to Prescribing Oncologists/Oncology clinics/Oncology 
departments/Pharmacists as per country-specific distribution channels. The DHPC and the 
communication plan are provided as attachments to this report. 
3.3.  Conclusion  
Based on the data provided by the iDMC and the MAH, the CHMP agreed with the SmPC changes to 
restrict the 1st line indication in urothelial carcinoma based on the preliminary data from an ongoing 
clinical trial (IMvigor130) which showed reduced survival with Tecentriq monotherapy compared to 
standard chemotherapy when used as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose tumours have low expression of PD-L1.  
A DHPC will be sent by 9th July to Prescribing Oncologists/Oncology clinics/Oncology 
departments/Pharmacists as per country-specific distribution channels. 
4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
The safety of atezolizumab monotherapy is as expected. There was no increase in frequency of all 
grade AEs, severe (Grade 3-4) AEs or AEs leading to treatment discontinuations observed for patients 
in the atezolizumab monotherapy arm of IMvigor130 study and the adverse event profile to date is 
consistent with the known safety profile for atezolizumab. 
5.  Risk management plan 
The MAH should update the RMP accordingly within an upcoming regulatory procedure affecting the 
RMP.  
6.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
At the time of the initial approval of Tecentriq in the 1st line cisplatin-ineligible indication, the overall 
response rates of atezolizumab compared less favourably to the best historical comparator of 
carboplatine/gemcitabine (Carbo/Gem) (22.7% versus 36.1%), responses were ongoing in 70% of 
patients with a median follow-up of 17.2 months (compared to 5.3 months for Carbo/Gem). In order to

evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab in terms of PFS and OS, the MAH was requested to submit the 
results of study IMvigor 130, a phase 3 randomised study comparing atezolizumab monotherapy or 
atezolizumab and carboplatin/gemcitabine with cisplatin/gemcitabine in untreated patients (cisplatin-
ineligible and –eligible patients). 
On 19 March 2018, the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) for study IMvigor130 met for 
an ad-hoc closed session scheduled at their request. Based on the review of data from a snapshot 
dated 12 March 2018, and meeting discussion, the IDMC recommended the following to the Sponsor 
Data Review Board (DRB): 
“Based on review of survival data in all patients randomized to date, the DMC recommends closure of 
Arm B (Atezo alone) to further accrual for all patients whose tumors are IC0 or IC1 for PD-L1. Patients 
who have tumors that are IC2/3 can continue to be randomized to Arms A, B or C. Arms A and C 
should remain unchanged (open to all eligible patients irrespective of their PD-L1 status).” 
The MAH has appropriately distributed a Dear Investigator Letter (DIL) to all study sites and local 
health authorities. The DIL clearly describes the decision made by IDMC and the consequences it has.  
Overall, data show a lower OS in patients whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression < 5%. The lower 
efficacy cannot be attributed to higher rates of AE, SAEs or withdrawals, as the safety of atezolizumab 
in the monotherapy is as expected. Nor can the differences be attributed to differences in baseline 
characteristics. Tecentriq was approved in 1L cisplatin-ineligible patients based on single arm data. 
However, study IMvigor 130 now provides comparative data that show a lower efficacy in patients that 
are either PD-L1 negative (IC0) or low expressers (IC1).  
Thus, a restriction of the indication is warranted.  
The MAH applied for a variation to update section 4.1 and 5.1.  
The CHMP agreed with the update of Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC.  
A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) was considered necessary to communicate on 
the restricted indication. 
The benefit-risk balance of Tecentriq remains positive in the NSCLC indication and 2nd line urothelial 
carcinoma indications. As for the 1st line urothelial indication, the benefit risk remains positive in 
patients whose tumours have a PDL-1 expression ≥ 5%.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ataluren is conditionally approved in the European Union (EU) since 31 July 2014 for the following 
indication: 
“Treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin 
gene, in ambulatory patients aged 5 years and older.”  
Ataluren is a first-in-class oral orphan drug designed to enable ribosomal read through of premature 
stop codons, resulting in the formation of a full-length functional protein in patients with nonsense 
mutation genetic disorders. Ataluren is available in granules for oral suspension in sachets of different 
strength (125 mg, 250 mg, and 1000 mg). 
On 31 July 2014, the European Commission issued a conditional Marketing Authorisation (MA) for 
ataluren. This implied that the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) had to complete ongoing studies, 
and to conduct (PTC124-GD-020-DMD [Study 020]) as a Specific Obligation, in order to confirm that 
the risk-benefit balance is positive and to provide additional data. These data formed the basis of the 
renewal of the conditional MA. The benefit/risk was re-evaluated during the renewal procedure in 
2016. In November 2016, the CHMP concluded that the conditional marketing authorisation could be 
renewed considering that the totality of the clinical data available continued to support the positive B/R 
of ataluren in the context of a conditional approval. The Committee also took into account the fact that 
the MAH proposed an updated confirmatory study design, built upon the most current knowledge of 
the disease and its natural progression, as well as on the data gathered from the previous studies, and 
considered it appropriate to serve as a specific obligation to answer the remaining uncertainties in the 
context of conditional marketing authorisation. 
In the current application the MAH proposes to lower the age limit.  Originally the MAH proposed to 
perform clinical studies in children from 6 months – 5 years. However, the PDCO concluded that due to 
possible different PK and safety concerns, the clinical studies should be split into two different groups; 
6 months - 2 years and 2 - 5years. Taken the concerns from the PDCO into account the MAH has 
performed a clinical study in 2-5 years. The current proposal is to change the indication to patients  ≥ 
2years because, from a disease pathology perspective, that treatment for DMD would be most 
effective when initiated as early as possible in the course of the disease.

In summary, the current submission concerns the request for the extension of indication to include a 
new population (children from 2 to less than 5 years of age) for Translarna for the treatment of 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene in 
ambulatory patients aged 2 years and older.   
The proposed recommended dose and schedule of ataluren in children 2-5 years of age is the same as 
that approved for children ≥ 5 years of age, i.e. 10 mg/kg body weight in the morning, 10 mg/kg body 
weight at midday, and 20 mg/kg body weight in the evening (for a total daily dose of 40 mg/kg body 
weight). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The clinical trial supporting this application was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the 
applicant. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The basis of this submission is Study PTC124-GD-030-DMD (study 030) - a multiple-dose, open-label 
study evaluating the safety and PK of ataluren in patients aged ≥ 2 to <5 years old with nmDMD for a 
period of 28 days (4 weeks). In order to collect longer-term safety and some efficacy functional 
endpoint information (i.e, TFTs and NSAA assessments), a 48-week extension phase was added. 
The role of the pharmacokinetic data in this application is to show comparable ataluren 
pharmacokinetics in children 2-5 years with the pharmacokinetics in older children in order to bridge 
the efficacy and safety from children ≥ 5 years of age to children 2-5 years of age. For that purpose an 
updated popPK analysis was presented.  
Study design 
Study 030 was a Phase 2, multiple-dose, open-label study evaluating the safety and  PK of ataluren in 
patients aged ≥2 to <5 years with nmDMD. The study included a 4-week screening period, a 4-week 
treatment period to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics, a 48-week extension period, and a 4-week 
follow-up period (60 weeks total). The PK evaluation was conducted in the first 4 weeks (day 1 and 
day 28), which also included safety assessments.  
The results from a population PK simulation supported that a study design of 12 patients with 7-point 
sampling after the morning dose (sample size and sparse sampling strategy) would provide adequate 
data to assess PK in children with nmDMD aged ≥2 to <5 years. This design was agreed upon by the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431114/2018 
Page 6/63 
Changes in this updated version consist in the redaction of personal data, in compliance with

Paediatric Committee (PDCO) as well as the Modelling and Simulation Working Group (MSWG) through 
a Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) consultation (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/34612/2017).  
Patients were administered ataluren 3-times per day (10, 10, 20 mg/kg). The drug product lots used 
were the granules for oral suspension formulation, which is the same as the marketed formulation in 
the European Union (EU), and the one used in Phase 2b PTC124-GD-007-DMD and Phase 3 PTC124-
GD-020-DMD studies.   
Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours post morning dose on Days 1 
and 28 to provide information about Day 1 and steady-state ataluren plasma concentrations. 
Conventional PK parameters of ataluren on Day 1 and 28 were derived by non-compartmental analysis 
(NCA), using Phoenix WinNonlin® v6.4 software (Certara, LP, Princeton, NJ, USA).  PK parameters 
such as AUC0-6, AUC0-10, Cmax (0-6 hr), Ctrough@6h, tmax (0-6 hr) were calculated as appropriate for Day 1 
and Day 28.  The accumulation ratio (AR) on Day 28, AR(AUC) and AR(Cmax) were also calculated. 
Using the nmDMD Relative F Model (2017) with pooled data from healthy volunteers, patients with 
nmDMD, and patients from Study 030, ataluren plasma exposures and other PK parameters such as 
AUC0-24, Cmax, and Cave, CL/F, and Vss/F were estimated and compared with those estimated for 
nmDMD patients aged ≥5 years who received the same dosing regimen (studies PTC124-GD-004-DMD 
and PTC124-GD-007-DMD) (as discussed in the population PK modelling below). 
Population PK analysis 
The population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for ataluren has been refined over time based upon the 
availability of data from various studies. The data from a recently completed study in patients with 
nmDMD aged 2-5 years (Study 030) and from study 026 (interaction study with rifampin) in healthy 
volunteers were pooled with data from healthy volunteers (studies 001 and 002) and patients with 
nmDMD who had participated in Studies 004/004e and 007/007e, which had been used to previously 
develop a population PK model for ataluren (ICPD 00321-2). The population PK model has been refined 
using the pooled data. In addition, several activities were performed to comply with scientific advice 
that was provided by the SAWP in January 2017 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/34612/2017). The primary goals 
of the analysis were as follows: 
 Refine the previous population PK model to incorporate the data from younger patients (ages 2 – 5), 
 Confirm the driver for the decrease in ataluren exposure with time (i.e., time-dependent relative 
bioavailability or time-dependent clearance), 
 Conduct a covariate analysis to identify any other patient characteristics that are associated with the 
inter-individual variability in ataluren PK (including confirmation of the previously derived coefficients 
governing the relationship between body weight and clearance or volume), and 
 Refine the presentation of prediction-corrected visual predictive check plots to mimic those most 
commonly presented in the literature 
In the above mentioned 6 studies, ataluren was administered orally with doses ranging from 3 to 200 
mg/kg. PK data from 76 healthy volunteers and 226 nmDMD patients were included in the model. PK 
data from study 15, 24 Japanese and 24 non-Japanese healthy volunteers administered a single dose 
5, 10 or 20 mg/kg of ataluren granules formulation were used as external validation. 
PK model structure 
The PK structural model used rich data from healthy volunteers. The primary structural model was a 
two-compartment model with first-order absorption and linear elimination. The impact of food on both

Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 
 
 
the rate (ka) and extent (relative bioavailability or F) of absorption, as well as the impact of diurnal 
variation (e.g., impact of morning vs. evening dosing) on CL/F, were assessed a priori as part of the 
structural PK model.  
The structural model parameters were then re-estimated after pooling the data from the healthy 
volunteers, nmDMD patients and cystic fibrosis patients to allow for testing for potential differences 
between the three populations. Absorption rate dependent on dose and relative bioavailability 
dependent on time with time), formulation (day 1), or disease state (at steady-state) were included 
into the model. 
This population PK (popPK) model was the base model and refined with the pooled data from the 6 
studies in healthy volunteers (N= and nmDMD patients. PK data from cystic fibrosis patients were not 
longer included in order to enrich the PK dataset for nmDMD patients.   
The decrease in ataluren exposure over time was evaluated by time-dependent relative bioavailability 
and a time dependent clearance model. A model using allometric scaling i.e. 0.75 or clearance and 1.0 
for volume of the central compartment, was tested but found unstable. 
Covariate analysis 
After updating the Expanded Model (2013/2014) using the additional PK data, a formal covariate 
analysis was initiated in NONMEM using stepwise forward selection. Continuous descriptors that were 
evaluated for their potential to explain a portion of the inter-individual variability in PK parameters 
included age in years, weight in kg, height in cm, BSA in m2, BMI in kg/m2, and calculated CLcr in 
mL/min/1.73 m2. Categorical covariates that were evaluated include sex, race, patient status (healthy 
subjects, nmDMD), formulation, and potentially study if warranted. 
Stepwise forward (6.635 change in the MVOF (α = 0.01, 1 df ) and backward elimination (at least a 
10.83 increase in the MVOF (α = 0.001, 1 df) was applied to select the covariates. 
Model Evaluation 
Model evaluation was assessed by graphical evaluation of standard goodness-of-fit plots, as well as 
plots of the observed and predicted concentration-time profiles, examination of the predicted 
parameter estimates and their precision (standard error of the mean) and comparison of these values 
to historical results. A prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC) was also used to assess the 
ability of the fixed and random effects components of the final PK model to adequately describe the 
observed ataluren concentration-time data. 
The fit of the time-dependent relative bioavailability and a time dependent clearance model were 
compared by graphical evaluation of standard goodness-of-fit plots, examination of the predicted 
parameter estimates and their precision (standard error of the mean). Further the models were used 
to predict the plasma concentration-time profiles for the subjects from study 026 when ataluren was 
given in combination with rifampin. 
Generation of PK Exposure Measures 
The individual, Bayesian post-hoc PK parameters from the most appropriate model were used to 
simulate plasma ataluren concentration-time profiles in order to estimate Day 1 and steady-state 
exposure (Cmax, AUC0-24, and Cave) for the patients from Study 030 (≥2 and <5 years age) included 
in the analysis as well as the patients from Study 004 and 007 (>5 years age) who received the same 
dose regimen as those in Study 030 (10/10/20 mg/kg). Note that, due to the sparse sampling 
employed in Study 030, the simulated profile contained augmented times in order to provide a more 
relevant comparison to the profile from patients in Study 004, who were sampled relatively intensively 
on Day 1 and at steady-state (e.g., Day 28).

Model-Based Simulations 
The final population PK model will be used as the basis for model-based simulations of PK results from 
Study PTC124-GD-030-DMD (Study 030), a Phase 2, open-label study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, 
and pharmacodynamics of ataluren in patients with nmDMD aged two to five years. The objective of 
the simulation exercises will be to assess the expected exposure to ataluren in children aged two to 
five years of age receiving the labelled daily dose of 40mg/kg/day (as administered in 3 doses of 
10/10/20 mg/kg) to assure that exposure is consistent across the age continuum.  
POPPK ANALYSIS RESULTS 
Parameter estimates and associated standard errors from the fit of the nmDMD Relative F Model 
(2017) to the data from healthy subjects and nmDMD patients are provided in Table 1. The parameters 
relative bioavailability at steady-state (FSS) for healthy subjects (0.568 or 56.8%) and kdec (0.0113 
hr-1) were fixed to the final estimate from the healthy subject models in the previous report. An 
attempt was made to fit the value for TSTART but the resultant value was consistent with the previous 
estimate of 60 hr and was estimated with poor precision. Thus, this parameter was also fixed. 
Similarly, the values for F0 and FSS for the POS and granules formulations were fixed to the prior 
estimates. The final estimate of F0 was 0.642 (64.2%) for the POS formulation and 0.898 (89.8%) for 
the granules formulation. The estimate of FSS was 0.568 (56.8%) for healthy subjects, and was 
slightly lower (FSS = 0.414 or 41.4%) for nmDMD patients.

The pc-VPC plots are provided in Figure 2,Figure 3, and Figure 4 for all subjects/patients, nmDMD 
patients only, and Study 030 patients only, respectively.  
Note that the data from the extension studies (004e and 007e) were not included in the pc-VPC plots 
due to the extremely long time of treatment, which resulted in file size issues. However, these plots 
are considered sufficient for assessing the predictive ability of the model at steady state as all patients 
received at least 28 days of treatment.

External Validation using single-dose adult data in order to assess the ability of the nmDMD Relative F 
Model (2017) to capture single-dose data obtained from adults that were not included in the 
development of the model, a traditional visual predictive check (VPC) was constructed. This involved 
the replication of the Study 015 dataset 500 times in order to simulate concentration-time profiles for 
the 48 subjects while incorporating the inter-individual and residual variability from the final population 
PK model. The resultant VPC plots are provided in Figure 5.

Bioanalytical assay 
The quantitation of ataluren in human plasma in the clinical studies was carried out using validated 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays with high sensitivity and

Comparison between nmDMD patients 2-5 years of age and ≥ 5 years of age 
PopPK analysis was used to estimate the ataluren exposure in the population of ≥2 to <5 years (study 
030) and compare it with the exposure in the population of patients aged ≥5 (studies 004 and 007). 
Table 5 summarises ataluren PK parameter and exposure estimates in patients receiving the 10/10/20 
mg/kg regimen by study. The median steady-state ataluren Cave in the 14 patients from Study 030 was 
6.23 μg/mL, which is slightly lower but consistent with that seen in the older nmDMD patients (median 
steady-state ataluren Cave of 10.3 in Study 004 and 6.55 in Study 007).  
Visual comparisons of exposure in the patients from Study 030, Study 004, and Study 007 are provided 
in Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
There are no pharmacodynamics data submitted by the applicant. The MAH performed only PK studies 
and relied on the claim of a PK-PD correlation from the previous study. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Based on previous PK-PD analyses [17], a target ataluren Cave,ss of >0.970 and <17.6 μg/mL is aimed 
for. All of the patients 2-5 years of age had an ataluren Cave of >0.970 and <17.6 μg/mL suggesting that 
the dose of ataluren 10/10/20 mg/kg is appropriate for nmDMD patients aged ≥2 to <5 years. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The basis of this submission for the extension of indication to include a new population (children from 2 to 
less than 5 years of age) for Translarna for the treatment of nmDuchenne muscular dystrophy is one 
multiple-dose, open-label study 030, evaluating the safety and PK of ataluren in patients aged ≥ 2 to <5 
years old with nmDMD for a period of 28 days (4 weeks). It was intended to show comparable ataluren 
pharmacokinetics in children 2-5 years with the pharmacokinetics in older children in order to provide 
basis for a conclusion on the expected the efficacy and safety in children 2-5 years of age.  
Ataluren is mainly eliminated by intestinal and hepatic glucuronidation. Maturation rates of hepatic UGTs 
vary between the UGTs, but may extend beyond the age of two years. UGT1A9 is the main UGT enzyme 
involved in metabolism of ataluren. Hepatic UGT1A9 levels reached adult values well before the age of 
two years (Strassburg et al. 2002, Miyagi et al. 2012). Therefore, no age related differences in 
glucuronidation other than difference in body size between patients ≥2 to <5 years and ≥5 years of age 
are to be expected.  
Pharmacokinetic data were collected at day 1 and day 28. The treatment dose was 10/10/20 mg/kg for 
morning/midday/evening dose. Using the available data on the observed plasma values, ataluren 
exposure appears to be similar in nmDMD patients ≥2 to <5 years of age compared to those ≥5 years of 
age. 
Flat dosing is recommended per predefined weight groups (SmPC section 4.2). As a consequence, 
children <31 kg were dosed 125 mg or 250 mg, dose range 7.7 mg/kg to 15.1 mg/kg. Ataluren exposure 
varied dose proportionally, hence there was considerable variability between subjects due to the 
difference in dosing. Using the dosing regimen currently proposed (multiples of sachets of 125 mg, 250 
mg and 1000 mg), this resulted in almost a 1.6-fold difference in predicted ataluren exposure in nmDMD 
patients 2-5 years old: patients 2-5 years old with low body weight <17 kg had a lower exposure than 
nmDMD patients ≥ 17 kg. Further, the predicted exposure in patients <17 kg was lower compared to 
nmDMD patients ≥ 5 years of age in study 004 without an overlap in ataluren exposure. Additional data 
analysis showed that the trend was not universal and the intersubject variability in ataluren exposure 
cannot be fully attributed to the different dosing regimen. As body weight was a covariate on clearance 
with a power coefficient less than 1, a lower exposure in subjects with a low body weight can be expected 
applying a mg/kg dosing regimen. 
The MAH proposal to use PopPK analysis was to estimate the ataluren exposure in the population of ≥2 to 
<5 years and compare it with the exposure in the population of patients aged ≥5. However, the CHMP 
concluded that there were too many shortcomings in the proposed model, bringing about uncertainties 
about the ability of the popPK model to adequately describe the pharmacokinetics of ataluren in children 
2-5 years of age.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431114/2018 
Page 23/63 
 
  
  
These uncertainties related to model development and presentation of the data and included e.g.: 
external validation using single dose data in healthy volunteers from study 15 indicates that the model 
does not capture well the dose dependent elimination; a time-dependent bioavailability was included in 
the model while PK data from study 30 in nmDMD patients 2-5 years of age did not indicate time 
dependent pharmacokinetics. Empirical adjustments have been made to the model to fit the measured 
steady-state data without a mechanistic basis. Despite the efforts by the MAH, ultimately the popPK 
model can provide little additional value over measured plasma concentration data.  
In terms of the expected pharmacodynamics of ataluren, it is plausible to assume that a similar 
pharmacodynamic effect in boys 2-5 years old should be expected as in patients >5 years old, provided 
similar exposure levels are achieved. The MAH did not submit new PD data, but rather reiterated the 
position that due to the specific exposure-response behaviour of ataluren, a dose of 10/10/20 mg/kg 
could be appropriate for nmDMD patients aged ≥2 to <5 years, as it is assumed that it would result in 
target concentrations of ataluren that are likely to provide the expected PD effect. In their conclusion the 
CHMP agreed with the proposed approach.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP concluded that the presented popPK model had inherent flaws not allowing it to serve the 
initially intended purpose of demonstrating comparable ataluren exposure in patients aged 2-5 years with 
that of nmDMD patients aged ≥5 years of age. Despite all the efforts by the MAH, the concerns regarding 
the model remain, and ultimately it was seen as unable to provide additional value over measured plasma 
concentration data. With that in mind, the Committee reviewed the available pharmacokinetic results 
from paediatric study 030 in nmDMD patients aged ≥2 to <5 years old dosed 10/10/20 mg/kg ataluren, 
and considered that the analysis of the observed plasma values can constitute another approach in 
verifying the comparability of exposure between the two groups. Recognizing the potential uncertainties 
in this approach, the Committee ultimately agreed that ataluren exposure appears to be similar in 
nmDMD patients ≥2 to <5 years of age compared to those ≥5 years of age, after administration of 
10/10/20 mg/kg ataluren. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
PTC124-GD-030-DMD (Study 030) is  multiple-dose, open-label study evaluating the safety and PK of 
ataluren in patients aged ≥2 to <5 years old with nmDMD for a period of 28 days (4 weeks). In order to 
collect longer-term safety and functional endpoint information (i.e, TFTs and NSAA assessments), a 48-
week extension phase was added. All patients received approximately 10-, 10, 20-mg/kg ataluren 3 times 
daily (TID) for 4 weeks during the PK portion and continue to receive the same dose for an additional 48 
weeks during the ongoing extension period. Ataluren is administered orally immediately after preparation. 
During the treatment period, each patient returned to the clinical research facility during Week 0 and 
Week 4 for PK testing, and at Week 16, Week 28 for safety and efficacy assessments. Subsequent visits 
are scheduled for Week 40 and Week 52. 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application.

Methods of Assessing Muscle Function 
Muscle function was assessed through timed function tests (TFTs) and the North Star Ambulatory 
Assessment. The time taken to run or walk 10 meters, to climb 4 standard stairs, and to rise from supine 
has predictive value for clinically meaningful loss of function, including ambulation, in DMD [McDonald 
2013]. 
The NSAA is a functional assessment tool designed for ambulant patients affected by DMD [Mazzone 
2010]. In its original form, it consists of 17 activities (including, for example, standing upright, rising to 
standing from a seated position, standing on one leg, walking, running, hopping, and jumping) each 
scored as 0, 1, or 2, with a higher score indicating better function and a maximum total score of 34. The 
full 17-item scale has been validated for use in children above the age of 5 years [Mercuri 2016]. 
Before the age of 4, many of the items (for example, standing on one leg and hopping) are not yet 
reliably performed by typically developing boys. At age 3, 85% of typically developing boys are able to 
fully perform 8 of the 17 items and 100% are able to perform 3 of them. It is only at age 4 that 85% of 
typically developing boys are able to achieve full scores in all 17 items [Mercuri 2016]. As a result, 
revised NSAA scales that include the subsets of items reliably performed by boys in the ≥ 2 and < 5 year 
age group are the most appropriate approach for this age group. The results for these developmentally 
appropriate 8- and 3-item scales, as well as the full 17-item NSAA scale, are presented here. 
These assessments were scheduled to be performed at baseline (Week 0), Week 28, and Week 52. 
Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
The patients ≥2 and < 5 years of age in the CINRG study and the patients in Study 030 were similar 
across a range of demographic and baseline characteristics. 
The mean age among patients in the selected age range of the CINRG study and in Study 030 was 3.5 
years and 3.4 years, respectively. Patients in Study 030 are slightly taller and heavier than their CINRG 
counterparts, but the BMI in both groups is comparable.

In Study 030, 6 (43%) patients (5 of whom are included in the evaluable population) received 
corticosteroid treatment at baseline, in comparison with 9 (29%) patients in the CINRG dataset. Given 
the effects of chronic administration of steroids on the slowing of disease progression in DMD, in Study 
030 investigators were encouraged to maintain as uniform a steroid regimen as possible. All 6 patients 
who received corticosteroids at baseline in Study 030, continued to do so concomitantly in stable 
regimens (Listing 16.2.8.7). 
Patient Disposition 
All 14 patients who were enrolled in Study 030 completed the 4-week PK phase and entered into the 48-
week extension phase. As of the 21 July 2017 cut-off date, 2 patients have completed the extension 
phase and no patients have discontinued prematurely from the study.

Results 
Time to run or walk 10 meters 
In the CINRG natural history dataset, for the 31 patients with both baseline and Week 28 assessments for 
the time to run or walk 10 meters, the mean time in seconds was slightly improved from the 7.32 second 
baseline, as is expected among patients in this age group, with a mean decrease of 0.32 seconds (a 
mean improvement of approximately 4% from baseline). Among the 12 patients in Study 030 with valid 
baseline and Week 28 assessments, the mean improvement was 0.6 seconds from the 6.7 second 
baseline, an 8.9% improvement over baseline. The relative improvement from baseline compared with 
that of natural history data (8.9% versus 4%) is evidence of clinical benefit of ataluren in younger 
patients.

aOne patient was excluded from this analysis due to a baseline assessment deemed invalid by the investigator, while a second patient 
did not have reported functional assessments at Week 28.  
Time to climb 4 stairs 
Clinical benefit is further supported by the results for the time to climb 4 stairs. In the CINRG natural 
history dataset, for the 28 patients with both baseline and Week 28 assessments for the time to climb 4 
stairs, the mean time in seconds was improved from the 7.30 seconds at baseline to 6.00 seconds at 
Week 28 (a mean decrease of 1.30 seconds and an improvement of approximately 18% from baseline). 
Among the 12 patients in Study 030 with valid baseline and Week 28 assessments, the mean time in 
seconds was also improved from the 7.4 seconds at baseline to 5.3 seconds at Week 28 (a mean 
decrease of 2.1 seconds and an improvement of approximately 28% from baseline). The magnitude of 
the relative improvement from baseline over natural history data (28% versus 18%) is further evidence 
of clinical benefit.

The time to stand from a supine position 
The time to stand from a supine position is an established early predictor of disease progression in boys 
with DMD over the age of 7 [Mazzone 2016] and is also of important clinical validity in younger boys, 
since it is the first milestone to be lost in DMD patients. In the CINRG natural history dataset, for the 25 
patients with both baseline and Week 28 assessments for the time to stand from a supine position, the 
mean time in seconds was slightly improved from the 5.68 second baseline, with a mean decrease of 0.65 
seconds, as is expected among patients in this age group. Among the 12 patients in Study 030 with valid 
baseline and Week 28 assessments, the mean time in seconds was also improved from the 7.6 seconds at 
baseline to 4.3 seconds at Week 28 (a mean decrease of 3.3 seconds and an improvement of 
approximately 43% from baseline). The magnitude of the improvement over natural history data (43% 
versus 11%) is notable.

aOne patient was excluded from this analysis due to a baseline assessment deemed invalid by the investigator, while a second patient

NSAA 
At 3 years of age, at least 85% of typically developing boys are able to reliably perform 8 of the 17 
functions on the full NSAA scale: stand, walk 10 meters, go from sitting in a chair to standing, climb a 
step (with the right and left foot), get to a sitting position, jump, and run. [Mercuri 2016] In order to 
more accurately assess functional improvement in patients ≥2 and <5 years of age, the 8-item scale 
based on only these functions was used. In the CINRG natural history data, for the 11 patients with both 
baseline and Week 28 assessments for the NSAA, the 8-item score was unchanged from the 14.00 
baseline. Among the 12 patients in Study 030 with a valid baseline and Week 28 assessment, the mean 
NSAA 8-item score was improved from the 10.42 baseline by 1.5 points, providing further support for 
clinical benefit of ataluren in this population, in a developmentally appropriate subset of functions.

Table 11 Change in North Star Ambulatory Assessment 8-item Score from Baseline to 
Week 28 in CINRG Natural History Dataset and Study 030 (Evaluable Population) 
There are 3 items that 100% of typically developing boys are able to perform from the age of 3 years: 
the ability to stand, walk 10 meters, and go from sitting in a chair to standing [Mercuri 2016]. In order to 
further evaluate functional improvement in patients ≥2 and < 5 years of age in the CINRG dataset and 
Study 030, a 3-item scale assessing only these items was also analyzed. In the CINRG natural history 
dataset, for the 11 patients with both baseline and Week 28 assessments for the NSAA, the 3-item score 
increased by 0.09 points from the baseline of 5.91. Among the 12 patients in Study 030 with a valid 
baseline and Week 28 assessment, the mean NSAA 3-item score was improved from the 5.33 baseline by 
0.5 points. 
While the populations in the ≥2 and < 5 age group in the CINRG dataset and Study 030 are generally 
comparable, the subset of 11 CINRG patients for whom NSAA assessments are available is not 
representative of the larger CINRG population in this age group. All 11 CINRG patients with both baseline 
and Week 28 assessments for the NSAA were 4 years old at baseline, an age at which at least 85% 
typically developing 4 year olds are able to perform all 17 functions of the full NSAA scale [Mercuri 2016]. 
The 12 patients in Study 030 with both baseline and Week 28 assessments included 4 patients who were 
3 years old at baseline and 1 patient who was 2 years old at baseline. This reflected in the more than 7-
point difference in the baseline NSAA total scores for this subset of CINRG patients and the 12 patients in 
Study 030 with valid baseline and Week 28 assessments. In the CINRG natural history dataset, for the 11 
patients with both baseline and Week 28 assessments for the NSAA, the total score was slightly improved 
from the 24.00 baseline, with a mean increase of 0.64 points. Among the 12 patients in Study 030 with 
valid baseline and Week 28 assessments, the mean NSAA total score was improved from the 16.8 
baseline by 3.4 points. The difference in the improvement in NSAA total score among CINRG patients and 
the ataluren-treated patients in Study 030 (0.64 points versus 3.4 points, respectively) is notable, despite 
the limitations of the comparison for this endpoint, and represents another indication of clinical benefit.

Table 12 Change in North Star Ambulatory Assessment Total Score from Baseline to 
Week 28 in CINRG Natural History Dataset and Study 030 (Evaluable Population) 
The linear transformation of NSAA scores to a scale of 0 to 100 has also been performed. An increase of 
4.0 linearized units per year has been reported in the literature for boys with DMD prior to age 7 [Ricotti 
2015]. 
Table 13 Change in North Star Ambulatory Assessment Linear Score from Baseline to 
Week 28 in CINRG Natural History Dataset and Study 030 (Evaluable Population) 
In the CINRG natural history dataset, for the 11 patients with both baseline and Week 28 assessments for 
the NSAA, the linear score was slightly improved from the 66.10 baseline, with a mean increase of 0.40 
points. Among the 12 patients in Study 030 with a valid baseline and Week 28 assessment, the mean 
NSAA linear score was improved from the 51.2 baseline by 8.2 points. Again with the caveat that the 
age-related difference in baseline complicates the comparison, this represents a notable and potentially 
clinically meaningful increase in function in relative to the change seen among the patients in the CINRG 
dataset.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
A  phase  II,  multi-dose  open  label  study  was  conducted  to  perform  PK  analysis.  The  study  included 
patients  between  2  and  5  years.  Patients  were  treated  with  40mg/kg/day  ataluren  for  4  weeks  in  this 
initial phase. To further assess the efficacy and safety profile of the product in the population, the study 
was extended to 48 weeks. As, this study was originally intended as a PK study, there was no placebo-
controlled  arm  included,  and  the  data  are  prone  to  different  kinds  of  bias  because  of  the  open-label 
structure of the study.  
The  MAH  has  used  historical  data  set  from  CINRG  to  provide  for  a  comparison  of  efficacy.  In  general, 
motor  function  development  and  disease  progression  in  DMD  subjects  are  subject  to  significant 
variability. For that reason the use of any historical data in the form of a treatment control group could 
only  be  accepted  if  the  strict  comparability  of  the  included  patients  is  guaranteed.    In  the  specific  case 
here,  the  selected  CINRG  population  did  not  differ  from  the  patients  included  in  study  030  in  terms  of 
age, sex, height and BMA. Importantly though, the two groups showed differences in patient weight and 
the  recorded  baseline  steroid use.  Although  a higher  mean  body  weight  did  not  result  in  a difference  in 
BMI between groups, it cannot be excluded that it might have an effect on the dose which each individual 
patient has received. In terms of concomitant steroid use, there were more patients in the study 030 that 
were  treated  with  steroids  (42.9%),  than  those  in  the  CINRG  data  set  (29%).  Since  treatment  with 
corticosteroids has a proven effect on disease progression in DMD (particularly notable in the first years 
of  treatment),  the  efficacy  and  safety  results  in  the  030  study  subjects  may  be  influenced  by  this,  and 
should be interpreted with caution.  
The extension phase is for 48 weeks, the study 030 is currently ongoing and in the application the MAH 
has provided data after 28 weeks of treatment. In light of the described mechanism of action of ataluren, 
and the results presented in the previous phase III studies (007 and 020), there is an increasing body of 
evidence  that  suggests  that  longer time  may  be  needed  for  any  effect  of  the  product  to  be observed in 
clinical  terms.  The  effect  on  the  6MWT  and  the  TFTs  was  not  convincing  after  48  weeks  in  the  studies 
mentioned above and the CHMP has recommended 1.5 years phase III study in order to account for the 
fact that clinical effect may need longer periods to be robustly demonstrated.  Therefore the presented 28 
weeks’  data  on efficacy  could  at  best  be  considered as  supportive information,  and  on  their  own  will be 
insufficient  to  provide  the  basis  for  a  robust  conclusion  on  the  efficacy  of  ataluren  in  the  target 
population. 
Considering  the  described  mechanism  of  action  of  ataluren,  the  MAH  maintained  the  position  that 
favourable  effects  of  treatment  could  be  expected  on  patient  functioning  and  less  likely  on  muscle 
strength. In support of this, the data presented in this extension of the indication application focused on 
parameters  and  endpoints  that  describe  functioning.  It  is  recognized  that  the  6MWT  is  not  a  reliable 
outcome measurement tool  in children <5years, and therefore in study 030 the efficacy outcomes were 
selected  to  be    three  measures  of  timed  function  tests  (TFTs)  and  a  revised  version  of  the  NSAA. 
Although in principle it is agreed that these may represent a more appropriate way to measure efficacy in 
this  young  patient  population,  it  has  to  be  kept  in  mind  that  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed 
differences  should  be  appropriately  justified.  Additionally,  the  interpretation  of  the  clinical  value  of  the 
observed difference is hindered by the short study duration and the lack of an appropriate control, in the 
form of a placebo or fully matched historical control group. In addition, supportive evidence from muscle 
strength and PD outcome measures is still considered insufficient.  
From the results presented for the three TFTs, it was evident that there were minor differences between 
the CINRG  controls and the study 030 population. The effect size of the observed difference is such that 
it fell within the variety range of both groups. For both the time to climb 4 stairs and the time to stand 
from  a  supine  position,  a  difference  in  baseline  levels  was  noted,  which  is  more  prominent  in  the  stand 
from supine position, and may influence the interpretation of the results. As mentioned before, the clinical 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431114/2018 
Page 33/63 
 
  
  
relevance of an improvement of 0.3 seconds in the time to run/walk 10 meters and an improvement of 
0.8 seconds in the time to descent 4 stairs has to be properly justified, preferably by a clear correlation to 
a clinical event signifying a clear effect on disease progression.  
The MAH performed the full NSAA test and 2 revised subsets – of 3 and 8 items. It has to be highlighted 
that the results provided represent an overlap, since the 3 items are also included in the 8 items subtest 
and in the full NSAA. Taking the clinical experts’ opinion into account, the most relevant test would be the 
revised 8-item NSAA as it can be performed reliably by patients aged 4 years (the average age of Study 
030 population). Based on this evaluation, the CINRG patients showed no improvement or deterioration, 
while for the subjects in study 030 there was an observed improvement of 1.5 points. The interpretation 
of  this  result  should  be  made  with  caution  as  there  are  confounding  factors  that  may  have  significantly 
contributed to it, like the inherent variability in the disease course, or the abovementioned differences in 
the patients’ characteristics in the two groups.  
The  demographics  of  the  11  subjects  from  CINRG  were  not  provided,  but  the  fact  that  these  have  a 
higher mean NSAA score at baseline (14.0 versus 10.4) might suggest that these are older boys (i.e. able 
to  perform  more  items  on  the  8  item  NSAA).  This  assumption  is  also  supported  by  the  difference  in 
baseline as provided on the total NSAA – 24.0 versus 16.8 on the total score and 66.1 versus 51.2 on the 
linear score respectively. The lack of any improvement in the CINRG (on the 8 item and the total NSAA) 
as compared to some improvement in the 030 subjects might also be due to the fact that the historical 
control group was not completely matched, as these were older boys able to perform more of the items 
on the NSAA, who were compared to younger boys still acquiring new skills and functions.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Although the efficacy data from study 030 present a trend in favour of ataluren treated DMD patients 
aged 2-5 years old, when compared to a group of controls, taken from the CINRG database, there are a 
number of inconsistencies in the matching of the historical controls were noted, and have to be taken into 
consideration in the evaluation of the observed differences between the groups. Additionally, the effect 
size and its clinical relevance remain to be fully ascertained in terms of their importance for the 
functioning of patients and the expected potential benefit from ataluren treatment. Despite the 
abovementioned irregularities, it cannot be denied that a trend favouring ataluren was observed when 
measuring the functional performance of DMD boys, using clinically valid and established instruments like 
the TFTs and NSAA and its variants. Although the level of robustness of these data is insufficient to serve 
on their own as the basis for a conclusion that efficacy in DMD patients, aged 2-5 years has been 
unequivocally demonstrated, in the context of the available PK data they do provide additional support 
that efficacy is expected to be similar in these patients and the ones aged >5 years, as demonstrated in 
the previous development steps. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The most common side effects with ataluren (seen in more than 5 in 100 people) are vomiting, diarrhoea, 
nausea (feeling sick), headache, stomach ache and flatulence. Side effects are usually mild or moderate 
in severity.  
Ataluren must not be used at the same time as certain antibiotics known as aminoglycosides when these 
are given by injection into a vein.

Patient exposure 
Study 030 began with a 4-week PK phase assessing short-term safety and PK, followed by a 48-week 
extension phase to provide long-term safety and efficacy information in this population. Safety and 
pharmacokinetic data from the 4-week PK phase are available in a final PK CSR dated 21 April 2017. The 
cut-off date of the PK CSR was 10 February 2017.  
This summary presents safety data with a cut-off date of 21 July 2017 (the date by which data for the 28 
Week visit was captured in the database for all 14 patients), and includes events with a start date on or 
before that date. 
After the PK CSR cut-off date, the database was updated to include 6 additional adverse events 
experienced by 3 patients during the PK phase not previously reported in the PK CSR. 
These TEAEs (2 patients with events of flatulence, and one patient with events of pyrexia, contusion, 
constipation, and rash) are reflected in this summary. 
During development, 2 doses of ataluren: 10, 10, 20 mg/kg per day and 20, 20, 40 mg/kg per day were 
evaluated (Study 007). While both doses were well tolerated, clinical benefit was observed at the 10, 10, 
20 mg/kg dose, which was selected for the Phase 3 study 020 and subsequently granted marketing 
authorisation. This addendum thus summarizes safety data for the 172 patients administered the 10, 10, 
20 mg/kg dose from the two pooled nmDMD pivotal studies in patients aged ≥5 years (Study 007 and 
Study 020, the Pooled Studies) for the first 28 days of treatment. 
Adverse events 
Adverse Events During the First 28 Days of Treatment 
To allow for a comparison of safety in patients 5 and older with those < 5 years old in the 28-day PK 
phase of the ongoing Study 030, adverse event data from the first 28 days of treatment in Study 007 and 
020 (the two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week trials in patients with nmDMD aged 
≥5 years) were pooled and summarized. The adverse-event profile of ataluren in Study 030 was 
comparable to that of patients aged 5 and older in the pooled studies. 
The overall frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was slightly higher among patients 
in PK phase of Study 030 (10 patients; 71.4%) than among ataluren-treated patients the first 28 days of 
treatment in the Pooled Studies (81 patients; 47.1%). Treatment emergent events considered to be 
related to ataluren were infrequent in both Study 030 and the Pooled Studies. Within the first 28 days of 
treatment in the Pooled Studies, 3 patients receiving 10, 10, 20 mg/kg ataluren experienced TEAEs with a 
maximum Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade of severe (events of 
constipation, ileus, and disease progression). All TEAEs in the PK phase of Study 030 were mild or 
moderate in CTCAE-grade of severity.

Table 14 Overview of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events by Study for First 28 Days 
of treatment Reported for More than One Patient in the Pooled studies (Study 007 
and study 020) or Study 030 (Safety Population)  
There were no serious TEAEs among ataluren-treated patients in the first 28 days of the Pooled Studies or 
in the PK phase of Study 030. The most frequently occurring TEAEs among patients in the Pooled Studies 
treated with the 10, 10, 20 mg/kg dose of ataluren during the first 28 days of treatment were vomiting 
(15.1% of patients), diarrhea (8.7% of patients), headache (5.8% of patients), nausea (5.2% of 
patients).

During the PK phase of Study 030, 4 patients (28.6%) experienced TEAEs of pyrexia, 4 patients (28.6%) 
experienced TEAEs of rash (3 [21.4%] with events with the preferred term “rash” and 1 [7.1%] with an 
event with the preferred term “viral rash”) and 2 patients experienced TEAEs of flatulence (14.3%). 
In the PK phase of Study 030, all 4 events of rash began within the first 27 days of treatment(one event 
each on Day 6, Day 12, Day 22, and Day 27) and were mild in severity. (The event with the preferred 
term of “viral rash” was considered to be unlikely related to ataluren treatment.) The 3 events with a 
preferred term of “rash” were considered possibly related to ataluren. Study treatment was not changed 
in response to any of these events, which resolved within 1 to 15 days. 
All other individual adverse events were experienced by 1 patient each.

There were no deaths in the Pooled Studies or during Study 030 during the PK phase or as of the cut-off 
date, and no ataluren-treated patients experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) during the first 28 days 
of treatment in the Pooled Studies or in the PK phase of Study 030.

Adverse Events During the Extension Phase 
As of 21 July 2017, all 14 patients have completed the Week 28 visit. Adverse events beginning on or 
before this date are included in this submission. 
As of the cut-off date, all 14 patients (100.0%) experienced at least one TEAE, including 10 (71.4%) 
patients who experienced TEAEs in the PK phase and 10 (71.4%) patients who experienced TEAEs in the 
extension phase. The most commonly occurring treatment-emergent adverse events were pyrexia (6 
patients; 42.9%), rash (5 patients in total, 3 [21.4%] with events with the preferred term “rash”, 1 
[7.1%] with and event with the preferred term “viral rash”, and 1 [7.1%] with an event with the 
preferred term “rash generalized”), ear infection (4 patients; 28.6%), nasopharyngitis (3 patients; 
21.4%), and flatulence, vomiting, and cough (2 patients each; 14.3%). All other TEAEs were experienced 
by 1 (7.1%) patient each as of the cut-off date.

All TEAEs in both the PK phase and the extension phase were mild or moderate in severity. Of the 10 
(71.4%) patients who experienced TEAEs during the extension phase, 6 (42.9%) experienced TEAEs with 
a maximum CTCAE grade of mild, and 4 (28.6%) experienced TEAEs with a maximum CTCAE grade of 
moderate. Cumulatively, of the 14 (100%) patients who experienced a TEAE during the PK phase and the 
extension phase combined as of the cut-off date, 7 (50.0%) experienced TEAEs with a maximum CTCAE 
grade of mild and 7 (50.0%) experienced TEAEs with a maximum CTCAE grade of moderate.

Treatment-related adverse events are those deemed by the investigator to have a possible or probable 
relationship to study drug. In the PK phase, 3 events of rash and 2 events of flatulence were considered 
related to ataluren treatment by the investigator. In the extension phase as of the cut-off date, one event 
of fatigue was considered related to ataluren treatment by the investigator. 
No patient to date discontinued from the study due to a TEAE. In addition, there were no SAEs or deaths 
in the PK phase or the extension phase of Study 030 as of the cut-off date. 
Laboratory findings 
No clinically meaningful trends in hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis parameters were observed 
during the 28-day PK phase of Study 030 or the extension phase as of the cutoff date, and shifts from 
normal values at baseline to abnormal values at Week 4 and Week 28 were infrequent. Laboratory 
abnormalities were similar to those seen in the Pooled Studies and attributable to the underlying disease. 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with elevated total cholesterol and triglycerides [Srivastava 
2010] in part attributable to the use of corticosteroids, and changes in lipid profile are an identified risk 
associated with ataluren treatment for DMD [SmPC April 2017]. Most patients in Study 030 had normal 
values for HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides at baseline and at Week 28. At Week 28, there 
were mean increases from baseline in cholesterol and HDL levels of 13%, while LDL levels increased by 
18%. Mean triglyceride levels were decreased more than 8% from baseline at Week 28. Shifts from 
normal baseline values to abnormal values at Week 28 for lipid parameters were infrequent and 
experienced by 4 patients for total cholesterol (two of whom were receiving concomitant treatment with 
steroids), 1 patient for LDL, and 2 patients for triglycerides (1 of whom was receiving concomitant steroid 
treatment). In general, these patients had values at the higher end of the normal range at baseline and 
experienced relatively small increases to values above the upper limit of normal at Week 28.

As is characteristic of patients with DMD due to the leakage of enzymes from the muscle in the absence 
of dystrophin [Tay 2000], elevated levels of AST and ALT were common at baseline in Study 030. Low 
baseline levels of bilirubin were also common, while GGT levels were typically normal at baseline and on 
treatment. At Week 28, small mean decreases in AST and bilirubin, and small mean increases in GGT and 
ALT were observed. These changes were not clinically significant. There were no patients with shifts from 
normal baseline values to abnormal values for ALT or AST at Week 28. One patient with a normal value at 
baseline for GGT experienced a shift to a low value for that parameter at Week 28; 2 patients with normal 
baseline values for bilirubin also experienced a shift to low values at Week 28.

Low levels of serum creatinine can be characteristic of patients with DMD, since creatinine is produced in 
skeletal muscle, and patients with compromised muscle mass have correspondingly low levels of serum 
creatinine [Zhang 2015]. At Week 28, the mean values for serum creatinine and cystatin C were slightly 
increased from baseline. These changes were not clinically significant. The mean BUN value was 
unchanged from baseline to Week 28. All patients had normal values for cystatin C at both baseline and 
Week 28. Five patients had low serum creatinine values at baseline; 3 also had low values for serum 
creatinine at Week 28, while 2 had normal values at the latter timepoint. Nine patients had normal values 
for serum creatinine at baseline, 4 of whom had a shift to a low value at Week 28. One patient 
experienced a shift from a normal baseline value to an elevated BUN value at Week 28. Creatinine levels 
and urinalysis were normal for this patient throughout the treatment. No patients had elevated values for 
creatinine or cystatin C. 
There were no patients with shifts from normal values at baseline to abnormal values at Week 28 for 
albumin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, creatine kinase, direct bilirubin, glucose, indirect bilirubin, lactate 
dehydrogenase, protein, or sodium.

At Week 28, shifts from normal to low for bicarbonate and chloride and from normal to high for 
magnesium, potassium, and urate were experienced by 1 patient each. Two patients with normal values 
at baseline had high values for phosphate at Week 28 (Table 14.3.6.5). These shifts were not clinically 
meaningful.

Vital Signs, Physical Findings and Other Observations Related to Safety 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in vital sign parameters in Study 030 as of the cut-off date. 
Electrocardiograms 
Per protocol, ECGs are performed at baseline, Week 4, and Week 52 or End of Treatment. There were no 
clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities at baseline or Week 4 in Study 030.  
Other Studies Enrolling Patients Less Than 5 Years of Age 
Study 012 enrolled 11 patients ≥2 years of age with nonsense mutation methylmalonic acidemia 
(nmMMA) to receive ataluren 5, 5, 10 mg/kg for a 28 day cycle, followed by a period of 21 to 42 days 
without ataluren treatment before a second cycle of ataluren at a 10, 10, 20 mg/kg dose for 28 days. 
Three of the 11 patients were <5 years old at the time of enrollment; 2 patients were 3 years of age and 
1 patient was 4 years of age. Ataluren treatment was well tolerated by these patients at both dose levels. 
Vomiting was the most frequently reported TEAE. All TEAEs were mild in severity and resolved without 
concomitant treatment or dose modification. No patients discontinued treatment due to a TEAE.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The reported adverse events are in line with the reported events for the patient population >5 years.  
However, in the first 28 days of exposure the overall frequency of TEAEs in  Study 030 was higher than in 
the pooled studies 007 and 020 (10 patients; 71.4% versus 81 patients; 47.1%). The higher frequency 
seems to be driven by a higher frequency of malaise(7,1%), pyrexia (42.9%), ear infection (28,6%) and 
rash (21,4%), which may be considered as more frequent in younger children in general.  
For the 28 week cut off, the most common TEAEs were vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, nausea.  
All patients experienced at least one TEAE, however, these were all mild to moderate in nature.  
The  laboratory  test  analysis  showed  an  increase  in  cholesterol  and  triglycerides,  shifting  into  the 
abnormal range. At 4 weeks 2 patients shifted from normal to the high range. At 28 weeks an additional 
2,  leading  to  a  total  of  4  patients  shifted  to  the  high  range  of  cholesterol.  This  could  indicate  that  the 
cholesterol  levels  increase  over  time.  Therefore,  data  from  longer  exposure  is  required.  The  increase  in 
triglyceride was observed after 28 weeks and was not detected yet at 4 weeks.  
The  cholesterol  and  triglyceride  increase  is  observed  in  patients  both  with  and  without  corticosteroid 
treatment.  This  indicates  that  ataluren  treatment  alone  may  result  in  elevated  cholesterol  and 
triglycerides  reaching  abnormal  high  levels.  Furthermore,  the  renal  parameters  tested  show  an  increase 
in  blood  urea  nitrogen.  This  could  indicate  an  effect  on  renal  function  over  time.  Both  these  safety 
concerns are mentioned in the SmPC and are part of the RMP.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The available data on the safety of ataluren in the target population confirm the known safety profile of 
the product and do not raise any new concerns. They can be used to support the conclusion that there 
are reasons to believe that from a safety perspective, ataluren would behave similarly in DMD patients 2-
5-year-old as in those >5 years old. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

1Change in lipid profile was previously classified as an important identified risk however due to the signfiicant overlap between the risk 
and the important potential risk of long-term cardiovascular effects, the risk has been reclassified and is presently encompassed within 
the important potential risk: long-term cardiovascular effects. 
2Use  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  hepatic  impairment  is  no  longer  considered  missing  information  based  on  enhanced 
understanding  through  PTC124-GD-033-HV,  a  study  that  evaluated  the  safety  and  PK  of  ataluren  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe 
hepatic  impairment  (PRAC  recommendation  on  PSUSA/00010274/201707  –  08  February  2018).    The  study  was  conducted    to  develop 
guidance  for  ataluren  dosing  in  this  population.    Chronic  hepatic  impairment  is  an  uncommon  baseline  comorbidity  among  nmDMD 
patients.  The study completed in Q32017 and it was concluded no dose adjustments are necessary.  
3The use in patients whose ethnic origin is other than Caucasian is no longer considered missing information. The MAH has evaluated the 
evidence base to date and has found no meaningful difference in efficacy or safety with ataluren use in patients of non-Caucasian ethnic 
origin. 
4Safety with use in patients who do not have DMD caused by a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene is not established and there are 
no studies planned to evaluate off-label use.  As such, off-label use of this type will continue to be classified and monitored as missing 
information.

The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Translarna (Ataluren) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as  
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU.  
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14(7)] 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Main clinical study 
The  extension  of  the  indication  in  children  aged  ≥  2  to  <5  years  old  with  nmDMD  is  supported  by  data 
from one clinical study - Study 030. This was a Phase 2, multiple-dose, open-label study evaluating the 
safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ataluren in patients aged ≥ 2 to <5 years with nmDMD. The 
study  included  a  4-week  screening  period,  a  4-week  treatment  period  to  evaluate  safety  and 
pharmacokinetics,  a  48-week  extension  period,  and  a  4-week  follow-up  period  (60  weeks  total).  The 
proposed dose and schedule of ataluren in children 2-5 years of age was the same as those approved for 
children ≥ 5 years of age, i.e. 10 mg/kg body weight in the morning, 10 mg/kg body weight at midday, 
and 20 mg/kg body weight in the evening (for a total daily dose of 40 mg/kg body weight). 
Favourable effects 
The results from Study 030 were used to demonstrate that ataluren plasma levels in nmDMD patients in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431114/2018 
Page 59/63 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
the age range ≥ 2 to <5 years old overlapped with the ataluren plasma levels in children ≥ 5 years of age 
(studies  004  and  007)  when  dosed  according  to  the  regimen  10/10/20  mg/kg.  There  was  complete 
overlap in plasma concentrations between patients ≥2 to <5 years of age (study 30) compared to those 
≥5  years  of  age  (study  007,  pivotal  for  PKPD  relationship)  at  day  1  and  at  steady-state.  Although  the 
popPK model had inherent flaws which prevented use for its initially intended purpose, the plasma level 
data  allowed  the  CHMP  to  positively  conclude  that  the  ataluren  exposure  in  both  age  groups  was 
comparable. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Initially, a PopPK analysis was to be used to estimate the ataluren exposure in the population of ≥2 to <5 
years and compare it with the exposure in the population of patients aged ≥5. However, a number of 
uncertainties with the model hindered a reliable and accurate description of the pharmacokinetics of 
ataluren. Thus the data from the modelling alone were not considered sufficient to support the proposed 
dosing recommendations in children 2-5 years of age.  
The MAH did not provide any PD data, that may support the dosing in nmDMD patients ≥2 to <5 years. 
Hence, there was no actual confirmation that steady state levels in patients ≥2 to <5 years are sufficient 
to achieve the same magnitude of a PD effect and subsequent clinical improvement.  
Additional  results,  describing effects  of  ataluren  in  the  target  population,  were  provided  for  a  treatment 
period of 28 weeks, using a comparison with historical control data from the CINRG (n=14 and n=11 to 
31  for  the  study  group  and  historical  data  group,  respectively).  From  this  comparison,  the  results 
obtained  from  on  3  out  of  4  possible  TFTs  showed  a  trend  for  stabilisation  or  improvement.    The 
differences  were  0.3  sec.,  0.8  sec.,  2.65  sec.,  respectively  on  time  to  run/walk  10  m,  time  to  climb  4 
stairs, time to stand from supine tests. A similar trend was also observed for the NSAA and the revised 
NSAA results, both favouring the ataluren-treated patients.  The differences observed for the NSAA were 
2.0 points, 0.5 points and 3.0 points respectively on the 8-item, 3-item and total NSAA score.  
With regard to efficacy, the robustness of the observed results and conclusions is significantly affected 
from both the open label study design and a comparison with the external control CINRG data. The open 
label study design makes it susceptible to all types of bias, known to be present in unblinded studies, 
while the comparison to the CINRG data has several known drawbacks including pitfalls of indirect 
comparisons, large variability, some baseline differences between the two groups (e.g. treatment with 
corticosteroids), and short study duration.   
Additionally, the effect size of the observed differences on the TFTs and NSAA scores make it difficult to 
conclude whether they were of true clinical relevance, and therefore these results can only be interpreted 
as being supportive for efficacy in the young age group of 2-5 years, but will be insufficient on their own 
if presented outside of the context of the effects observed in the group of DMD patients >5 years of age.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Most adverse events as reported from study 030 are already known from previous experience with 
exposure to ataluren.  
However, in the first 28 days of exposure the overall frequency of TEAEs in  Study 030 was higher than in 
the pooled studies 007 and 020 (10 patients; 71.4% versus 81 patients; 47.1%). The higher frequency 
seems to be driven by a higher frequency of malaise (7,1%), pyrexia (42.9%), ear infection (28,6%) and 
rash (21,4%), which may be considered as more frequent in younger children in general.  
For the 28 week cut off, the most common TEAEs were vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, nausea. All 
patients experienced at least one TEAE; however, these were all mild to moderate in nature.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/431114/2018 
Page 60/63 
 
  
  
The laboratory test analysis showed an increase in cholesterol and triglycerides, shifting into the 
abnormal range. Change in cholesterol levels was observed at 4 weeks already, while for the triglycerides 
– only at week 28. Since changes in lipid profile have been observed in patients both with and without 
corticosteroid treatment, this is the first time that it can be concluded with certainty ataluren treatment 
alone may result in elevated cholesterol and triglycerides reaching abnormal  levels. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The additional safety data of exposure of the younger age group is with a maximum of 28 weeks. Longer 
exposure data is missing. Therefore it is uncertain what the long term safety of children 2- 5 years would 
be.  
The observed elevation in lipid cholesterol and triglyceride levels are in line with the data from nmDMD 
children aged >5 years old. As it is unknown whether these levels will continue to increase, the nmDMD 
children aged 2-5 years old need to be monitored similarly to the nmDMD children aged >5 years.   
Furthermore, although renal function seems in line with the data of nmDMD children aged > 5 years, the 
renal function needs to be monitored in both age groups as the long term effects remain unknown.

Ataluren  has  been  approved  for  ambulant  children  with  DMD  who  are  older  than  5  years.  Due  to  the 
progressive nature of the disease, from a biological and clinical perspective, it is agreed that it would be 
beneficial  to  start  early  treatment  in  DMD  patients,  if  the  beneficial  effects  outweigh  the  unfavourable 
effects.    In  order  to  expand  the  indication  in  younger  children,  it  was  recommended  clinical  studies  in 
children  aged  2-5  years  should  be  performed,  in  order  to  collect  as  much  PK  and  clinical  efficacy  and 
safety data as possible in this population. The MAH  provided the results from such a study (Study 030) 
and  argued  that  the  observed  PK  behaviour  and  the  positive  trends  registered  in  the  measured  clinical 
outcomes, together with the benign safety profile of the product, warrant the extension of the indication 
in  younger  DMD  patients.    The  provided  clinical  data  focused  on  patient  functioning only,  without  direct 
measurement of the effects on muscle strength. This may be acceptable, as the mechanism of action of 
ataluren  suggests  at best stabilisation  and  reduction  of  the  rate  of  loss  of  function,  rather than  a  direct 
effect on muscle strength.   
Regarding the outcome measures used, it is accepted that the 6MWT is not a reliable way of measuring 
effect in DMD children younger than 5 years, as they are still in the development phase of their walking 
ability.  Therefore  it  is  acceptable  that  in  study  030  the  efficacy  outcome  measures  were  3  TFTs  and  a 
revised  NSAA  tool.  It  was  difficult  for  the  CHMP  to  conclude  on  the  actual  clinical  relevance  of  the 
observed differences in the endpoints, but the registered positive trend could not be ignored. 
With  regard to the unfavourable  effects,  some  TEAEs  have  always  been of  special interest, especially  in 
the  context  of  a  lifelong  treatment.    The  safety  profile  data  from  study  030  confirms  that  the  already 
identified risks related to treatment with ataluren in older DMD patients are also relevant in patients 2-5 
years old. Additionally, in this study was the first time that subjects treated with ataluren only show an 
increase  in  glycerol  and  triglycerides  and  after  a  28  week  exposure.  This  is  an  indication  that  ataluren 
may  increase  the  cardiovascular  risk  and  has  to  be  considered  in  the  decision  on  the  time  to  start 
treatment in young nmDMD boys.  
The  concerns  regarding  the  suitability  of  the  popPK  model  to  provide  reliable  quantifiable  estimation  of 
ataluren  exposure  remain,  and  thus  it  was  concluded  that  the  model  could  not  be  used  to  support  the 
proposed  dosing  in  paediatric  patients  ≥2  to  <5  years.  Instead  the  comparison  of  ataluren  exposure  in 
nmDMD patients ≥ 2 to <5 years old with those ≥ 5 years of age has been mainly based on comparison 
of plasma concentrations.

Benefit-risk balance 
For this extension of the indication to nmDMD children aged 2-5 years, the applicant presented data from 
a single study in the target population, building upon the clinically justified approach that treating as early 
as possible in a neuro-muscular, progressive condition is meant to provide the most benefit for the 
treated patients. The applicant continues to defend that based on the available PK data, it can be 
reasonably assumed that similar exposure can be observed in older and younger DMD patients, providing 
for a similar efficacy and safety in both groups. Additionally, the observed positive trends in efficacy data 
can be used as supportive, and taking into account the generally mild safety profile of ataluren, can 
justify a positive benefit/risk ratio conclusion.  
The CHMP acknowledged that comprehensive assessment of efficacy in children ≥2 and <5 years of age 
is not feasible due to the rarity of diagnosed nmDMD patients <5 years of age. Thus, the Committee 
agreed with the above argumentation, concluding that assumption about the similarity of the efficacy and 
safety established in nmDMD children in both groups ( ≥5 years and below 5 years of age) can be made, 
provided that comparable exposure has been demonstrated in both age groups.  
The background of this position is that the disease process and pathogenesis of nmDMD, which is loss of 
muscle due to the absence of dystrophin, is independent of age. Also the mechanism of action of 
ataluren, to enable ribosomal read-through of mRNA containing a premature stop codon, resulting in 
production of a full-length protein (dystrophin), is expected to be the same in both age groups. 
Additionally, comparable ataluren exposure in patients ≥2 to <5 years of age with those ≥5 years of age 
could be assumed, based on the observed full overlap in ataluren plasma concentrations in patients from 
both groups.   
It was recognised that the results from the clinical data on TFTs and NSAA as provided, were not robust 
on their own. There are too many factors which influence the interpretation and put in question the effect 
size and clinical relevance of the observed results.  Nevertheless the observed positive trends cannot be 
ignored. On the other hand, the preliminary short term safety data seems in line with the patient 
population aged >5 years, and confirms the generally benign safety profile of the drug. No major 
unexpected safety issues were encountered in patients aged ≥2 to <5 years, and ataluren is well 
tolerated. 
In conclusion, taking into account the totality of the presented data up to this moment, the CHMP agreed 
that they allow to reasonably assume that the efficacy and safety profile of ataluren in children with DMD 
2- 5 years old could be expected to be similar to the one in patients older than 5 years, thus providing for 
a conclusion on a positive B/R ratio in this population.

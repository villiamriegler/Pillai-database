1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Gentium S.p.A. submitted on 3 May 2011 an application for Marketing Authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Defitelio, through the centralised procedure falling 
within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 27 July 2010. 
Defitelio was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/04/211 and EU/3/04/212 on 29 
July 2004 for the prevention and treatment of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) respectively 
in the following indication: 
Defitelio is indicated for the prevention of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) also known as 
Sinusoidal Obstructive syndrome (SOS) in haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation therapy. 
Defitelio is indicated for the treatment of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) also known as 
Sinusoidal Obstructive syndrome (SOS) in haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation therapy. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Defitelio as an orphan medicinal product in 
the approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website 
ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Rare disease designations. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Known active substance (Article 8(3) of Directive No 2001/83/EC) 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, 
non-clinical and clinical data and bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain test(s) or 
studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Not applicable 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for 
a condition related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 19 March 2008 
(EMEA/H/SA/996/2008/PA/II). The Scientific Advice pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier.

Licensing status 
Defibrotide (DF) was nationally approved in Italy in 1986 for “prophylaxis of deep vein 
thrombosis and treatment of thrombophlebitis. On 21 April 1993, marketing authorizations for 
defibrotide capsules 400 mg (Prociclide, Noravid and Dinelasi) for the treatment of peripheral 
obstructive (mild to moderate) arteriopathy, were granted in Italy. On 13 March 1993, the 
indication for all products was changed by the Italian Ministry of Health to “vascular disease 
associated with the risk of thrombosis (acute stage)”. 
The marketing authorisations for both Noravid and Prociclide were withdrawn by Gentium S.p.A. 
effective April 2009 for commercial reasons (principally to limit the import of the product in the US 
and Europe, as this was impacting the investigational use of the product in clinical trials). Dinelasi 
was never placed on the Italian market and the Marketing Authorization ceased to be valid 
according to Article 24 of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended (sunset clause) as of 9 July 2010. To 
date, defibrotide is no longer authorised in any of the EU Member States.  
The active substance was not licensed in any country at the time of submission of the application.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a complication of vascular origin, described in patients 
receiving high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy as conditioning regimens for Haematopoietic 
Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT). 
The pathophysiology of hepatic VOD is complex; the causative event is thought to be injury to 
sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes in zone 3 of the hepatic acinus as a result of the high 
dose chemotherapy preparative regimens used for stem cell transplant procedures. Thus, hepatic 
VOD is considered a regimen-related toxicity. A pro-coagulant and hypofibrinolytic state is present 
in hepatic VOD, perhaps representing the essential underlying mechanism of this disorder. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 11/135 
 
 
  
  
Table 1 
Clinical criteria to diagnose VOD 
The clinical diagnosis of hepatic VOD usually relies on the application of validated criteria described 
by Seattle or Baltimore criteria (Table 1). The principal difference in Baltimore criteria is the 
absolute requirement for bilirubin to rise to a level of >2 mg/dL (>34 µmol/L), in conjunction with 
≥2 additional clinical features of hepatic VOD. Baltimore criteria are known to identify the more 
advanced cases of hepatic VOD.  
As a consequence of liver dysfunction, patients may have hepatorenal syndrome with sodium 
retention and portal hypertension. This frequently progresses to acute oliguric renal failure which 
occurs in approximately half of the patients with severe disease, often leading to need for dialysis.   
Severe hepatic VOD, is defined as VOD in the presence of multi organ failure (MOF); either 
pulmonary dysfunction (with an oxygen requirement with an oxygen saturation of <90% on room 
air and/or ventilator dependence), and/or renal dysfunction (defined as doubling of baseline 
creatinine and/or dialysis dependence), and/or encephalopathy. Severe hepatic VOD is associated 
with a high risk of severe morbidity and mortality. Rarely do patients with severe hepatic VOD die 
of their liver failure; progressive MOF with consecutive lethal renal and cardiopulmonary 
complications are typically the main causes of death.  
Well-established risk factors for hepatic VOD include age, liver inflammation, prior abdominal 
irradiation, hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, and repetitive transplants with myeloablative conditioning 
regimens. The conditioning regimen is also a well-established risk factor in the pathogenesis of 
hepatic VOD, with cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation, and particularly busulfan being the 
most commonly associated conditioning agents associated with the onset of hepatic VOD.  
No therapy for the treatment or the prophylaxis of hepatic VOD has been approved in the US or in 
Europe. Investigations with several experimental approaches using anti-thrombotic and 
thrombolytic agents, including prostaglandin E1 and t-PA with or without concurrent heparin, have 
not proven successful, leaving the management of hepatic VOD restricted to supportive care alone. 
The current management of VOD is limited to supportive care, such as diuretics, analgesia, 
haemodialysis and mechanical ventilation.

About the product  
Defibrotide is a sterile, aqueous, concentrate for solution for infusion in clear 2.5 ml glass vials. 
Defibrotide is a mixture of oligonucleotides obtained from porcine intestinal mucosa and prepared 
by controlled depolymerisation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Defibrotide had been approved for 
thrombotic vascular disease indications in Italy, as both ampoules for injection and oral capsules.  
To date, the applicant’s development program of defibrotide in the treatment of VOD consists of 
three studies of defibrotide (Protocol 2005-01 (pivotal), Protocol 99-118 (dose-finding), and 
Protocol 2006-05, treatment-IND) in patients with severe hepatic VOD that are included in the 
efficacy database, conducted in the United States, Canada, and Israel. For the prevention indication 
of hepatic VOD, the study Eudra-CT 2004-000592-33 was performed in Europe and Israel. 
Compassionate use programs for the treatment of non-severe and severe VOD were established by 
the applicant. During the late stage of development, a treatment IND protocol (expanded access 
program) was initiated in the US to provide defibrotide to patients. 
On 21 January 2008, the applicant requested protocol assistance for their product defibrotide 
pursuant to Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000. The general subject of the protocol 
assistance was a planned phase III study for the prevention of VOD in adults and children, which, 
however, was never initiated. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Defibrotide (DF) is a polydisperse collection of the sodium salt of predominantly single-stranded 
oligodeoxyribonucleotides obtained from porcine intestinal mucosa and prepared by controlled 
depolymerisation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).  
The finished product is presented as a sterile, aqueous, concentrate for solution for infusion. The 
container closure system for Defitelio consists of 2.5 ml type I, neutral, clear glass vials closed with 
a rubber stopper and an aluminium cap. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Defibrotide is a polydisperse mixture of oligonucleotides produced by random, chemical cleavage 
(depolymerisation) of porcine DNA.  It is predominantly single stranded, of varying base sequence, 
lengths and conformations; unfolded, folded or combined. The mean oligonucleotide length is 50 
bases with a mean molecular weight of 17 ± 4 kDa. No individually defined component is at more 
than femtomolar concentration. The only meaningful scientific information that can be obtained 
about the biochemical nature of defibrotide (aside from determination of percentage of each 
nucleobase) is a measurement of its average length and its average percentage double stranded 
character. Therefore, it can be established that this active substance is of highly heterogenic 
nature.

described. The porcine mucosa for defibrotide is provided from three Italian abattoirs used in 
production of meat for food. The process is detailed adequately. Details on the audit system in place 
are provided and it is confirmed that all stages of sourcing are subjected to a suitable Quality 
Management System.  
The manufacturing process is overall, well described. The in-process control (IPC) tests are not 
extensive but the strategy has been justified by the applicant. 
Process Validation  
Results from three process validation batches were submitted. These are representative of the 
proposed current commercial process and the results shows consistency across the lots for the 
parameters and controls measured. 
The applicant uses pro-fibrinolytic assays and a cell based viability assay to demonstrate the 
activity of defibrotide. The CHMP conclusions from the results of these assays is that any in vitro 
activity in both fibrinolysis or endothelial cell protection is weak, and might even be seen as 
negligible when compared to negative controls.  
The claimed cell-protection activities of defibrotide have not been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Further work to investigate and confirm these properties is needed. 
Nonetheless, these are the only activities of defibrotide that could be shown by the applicant. Based 
on the measure of these biological activities on defibrotide produced for clinical trials, process 
validation lots, lots produced to support manufacturing process change and stability – there are no 
discernible differences in activity when samples are compared to appropriate defibrotide reference 
standards and proposed commercial lots.  
Characterisation 
The applicant has used a wide panel of methods to try to characterise defibrotide. In view of there 
being no identifiable discrete moieties, the applicant has characterised the ‘bulk’ properties. The 
applicant has shown that it is impossible to separate defibrotide constituents into any meaningful 
components. Component nucleic base analysis has been undertaken and demonstrates that the 
results are in line with that expected for DNA from other animal sources.  
Impurities 
The information presented regarding potential impurities/degradation products is considered 
sufficient, and the specification limits for impurities/degradation products and residual solvents are 
considered acceptable. The control strategy for impurities is adequately justified.

Overall, the assays used for testing in the active substance specification are described and shown to 
be validated. The validation of the proposed cell protection test has not been adequately 
demonstrated and completed. Furthermore, if the results support it, the assay should be introduced 
as a routine quality control test for batch release and stability testing for both defibrotide active 
substance and finished product. 
Stability 
Based on the data provided a shelf-life of 36 months for the active substance when stored at 
15-30°C is considered acceptable.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Defitelio  finished  product  is  a  sterile,  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  containing  80  mg  of 
defibrotide per mL in clear glass type I vials sealed with a rubber stopper and blue aluminium flip off 
seal. 
The excipients of the finished product solution are water for injections (WFI) as solvent, sodium 
citrate and sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid. All excipients comply with Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is supplied in single use glass vial of 2.5 mL sealed with a rubber stopper.  
Compatibility studies have demonstrated that the finished product is stable when diluted with 0.9% 
Sodium  Chloride  Injection  and  5%  Dextrose  in  infusion  bag  and  held  in  sterile  and  disposable 
syringes for up to 72 hours (at 15°C -25°C). However, from a microbiological point of view the 
product should be used immediately as indicated in the SmPC.  
Adventitious agents 
Virus safety 
It can be concluded from the viral safety evaluation, that the three viral clearance steps tested in 
the studies were robust and effective at clearing virus during the manufacturing process.  
Manufacture of the product 
The finished product manufacturing steps are adequately described. The manufacturing process 
can be regarded as a standard process. The in-process controls (IPC) are described and deemed 
suitable for controlling and monitoring the manufacturing process.

The applicant presents results from three process validation lots and gives IPC and batch analytical 
data. The clinical studies were conducted using material produced before some changes were made 
during development and thus not in line with proposed commercial product.   
The applicant uses pro-fibrinolytic assays and a cell based viability assay to demonstrate the 
comparability of defibrotide active substance/product over the years. Though the applicant has 
provided batch analysis data for the majority of the batches and these show comparability for the 
parameters measured, due to deficiencies relating to the appropriate characterisation of 
defibrotide, it is not possible to ascertain whether the changes will impact on relevance of 
commercial product with respect to clinical trials material and this was raised as a major objection. 
Without the ability to measure and compare more significant in vitro defibrotide biological activity, 
which is not likely to be forthcoming for this active substance, then it can be concluded that 
developmental changes over the years and over stability have not impacted the measured activity 
attributes. Thus, there appear to be no changes occurring that would affect activity of defibrotide 
and this might be due to there being negligible ability to detect any changes on account of activity 
being so close to negative controls. In conclusion, the issue raised relating to the characterisation of 
defibrotide and comparability is cleared from a quality perspective as no further quality input can be 
expected to provide useful information. 
Appropriately designed media fill studies have been conducted and showed that the results were 
acceptable. The container-closure has been shown to be resistant to microbial intrusion. All 
validation batches complied with the established in-process and release specifications as well as 
additional process monitoring data.  
Product specification 
Overall, the applicant has detailed the methods, equipment and parameters for the analytical tests.  
Where appropriate, the tests undertaken to confirm equipment calibration and system suitability 
have been stated. Methods have been validated. 
Stability of the product 
Based on the stability data provided the requested shelf-life (24 months, no specified storage 
condition) is considered acceptable. All studied parameters remained within the specification limits 
during the stability studies.  
For the in-use stability after first opening and dilution the applicant claims that defibrotide is 
chemically and physically stable at concentration range of 4 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL in sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or 5% glucose solution for infusion at 15-25ºC for 72 hours. 
However, from a microbiological point of view the product should be used immediately as indicated 
in the SmPC. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would not normally be expected to exceed 24 hours at 2-8°C unless 
dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
For this polydisperse and difficult to characterise product, a good manufacturing process control 
strategy plus the use of a discriminatory bioassay capable for showing batch to batch consistency is 
essential to ensure that commercial product remains representative to material used and qualified 
in clinical trials. 
The applicant has characterised defibrotide with several related profibrinolytic activity assays. The 
applicant also uses a cell protection assay to determine cell-protective activity in vitro. From a 
quality perspective, the activity of defibrotide in the profibrinolytic and endothelial cell protection 
assay is weak and possibly confounded by the signal:noise ratio.  
The claimed cell-protection activities of defibrotide have not been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Further work to investigate and confirm these properties is needed. If the results support it, the 
cell-protection assay should also be included in the finished product tests as well as the finished 
product testing strategy.  
No clear clinical correlation to quality attributes has been demonstrated. In addition to the biological 
assays described, much reliance will have to be placed on physicochemical tests. The above issues 
could lead to significant problems in confirming the quality of defibrotide over the lifecycle of this 
polydisperse and heterogeneous product.  
The benefit-risk assessment for authorisation of this product should take into account the 
limitations listed above. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The manufacturing process is overall, well described. The in-process control (IPC) tests are 
described and deemed suitable for controlling and monitoring the manufacturing process. 
Nevertheless, due to its intrinsic highly heterogenic nature, defibrotide is difficult to characterise 
using physicochemical tests, and together with the inability to show strong biological activity in an 
in vitro assay, the quality, consistency and control of defibrotide rests significantly on robust control 
over the manufacturing process. In view of the limitations in defining defibrotide from a quality 
perspective, and as no clear clinical correlation to quality attributes has been established, this could 
lead to significant problems in confirming the quality of the product throughout the lifecycle of this 
biologically sourced and polydisperse product. 
2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended further points for investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Defibrotide is described as a polydisperse collection of the sodium salt of predominantly 
single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from porcine intestinal DNA. The mean 
oligonucleotide length is 50 bases with a mean molecular weight of 17 ± 4 kDa, and at least 40% 
being >12 kDa. The structural formula is representative only of the composition as the 
oligonucleotides have varying base sequences, length and conformations; unfolded, folded or 
combined.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The applicant has presented a review of the pharmacological properties through a mixture of 
literature articles and non-clinical study data, in order to demonstrate and explain the complex 
mechanism of action for defibrotide. Three aspects were identified in this review to describe the 
activity of defibrotide (profibrinolytic/antithrombotic activity, its protection of endothelial cells from 
injury and its anti-inflammatory ability).  
In vitro studies examining the activity of plasmin, which plays an important role in fibrinolysis, have 
shown that defibrotide can increase its activity and can in turn increase fibrinolytic activity. There 
was noted that the defibrotide complex composition plays a part in its ability to bind to plasmin, 
however this has not been confirmed by the applicant. In vitro studies on HMECs and HUVECs have 
shown that Endothelial Cells (EC) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induce increased t-PA and 
PAI-1 expression, and this mechanism of activation of endothelial procoagulant and fibrinolytic 
response may be related to transplant complications such as VOD. Defibrotide was able to inhibit 
LPS-induced PAI-1 expression, and further increased t-PA activity, causing an increase in 
fibrinolytic activity. 
Damage to EC can be caused by an immunosuppressant such as F-Ara via up-regulation of ICAM-1 
molecules. Defibrotide is shown to down-regulate ICAM-1 and MHC class II antigen expression on 
the  endothelium  as  well  as  a  number  of  other  genes,  most  notably  caspase-3,  an  important 
pro-apoptotic  protein.  Defibrotide  has  also  been  shown  to  protect  against  TNF-α  induced 
cytotoxicity in cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells but had no effect in protecting 
L929 mouse tumour cells. The protective action seems to be limited to ECs only. 
The third mechanism of defibrotide activity was its anti-inflammatory action. A key part of the 
inflammatory process appears to be the translocation of leukocytes from the circulation to 
extravascular compartments. 
However, a clear mechanism of action of defibrotide was not convincingly established in the view of 
the CHMP.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were conducted by the applicant. A review of the relevant 
literature has been assessed. This review indicates a possible secondary pharmacodynamic activity 
of defibrotide of anti-angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a multi-step process involving the formation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 18/135 
 
  
  
new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature and is necessary for primary tumour growth, 
invasiveness and development of metastasis. It is thought that defibrotide with its endothelium 
protective properties would stabilise or normalise the endothelium and thus prevent proliferation 
and/or sprouting of endothelial cells into the malignant tissue. In vitro and in vivo studies have 
shown an anti-angiogenic potential of defibrotide (Koehl 2007, Gottfried 2007). Other studies have 
shown that defibrotide may enhance in vivo chemosensitivity of multiple myeloma and mammary 
carcinoma xenografts in animal models. The proposed mechanism is that defibrotide favourably 
modulates antitumour interactions between bone marrow stromal cells and endothelia in the 
tumour microenvironment. However, the CHMP concluded that this is not fully demonstrated.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Central nervous system(CNS) 
CNS effects were studied as part of a 13 week i.v. infusion toxicity study in rats. The study included 
a Functional Observational Battery (FOB). The rats were given defibrotide at 240, 1200 or 4800 
mg/kg/day (multiple of human equivalent dose [HED] is 1.5, 7.7 and 31, respectively - human dose 
is four 2 hour infusion daily at dose of 6.25 mg/kg [≈25 mg/kg/day]) by continuous i.v.infusion for 
9 weeks. There were no test article-related changes in FOB over the course of the study. Some 
test-article related effects were observed which were not considered to be adverse. Studies 
performed in rats in the 1970s showed no effect on body temperature, no modification of 
pentobarbital sleeping time and no antagonism on pentrazole convulsions. 
Cardiovascular system (CV) 
Defibrotide did not reduce hERG tail current at concentrations up to 500 μg/ml. ECG examinations 
were performed as part of a 13 week intravenous infusion toxicity study in dogs. Dogs were given 
defibrotide at 60, 300 or 1600 mg/kg/day (multiple of HED is 1.3, 6.6 and 35, respectively) by 
2-hour iv infusions for 13 weeks. There were no effects of defibrotide on quantitative ECG 
parameters. 
Respiratory system 
No dedicated study to examine the respiratory effects of defibrotide has been performed. No effects 
on respiratory functions were observed in 13 week toxicology studies in dogs or rats, and no effect 
on respiratory function was observed in a QTc study in healthy volunteers. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Defibrotide did not impair the in vitro antitumor effect of F-Ara (Eissner 2002) or thalidomide. In a 
mouse xenograft multiple myeloma model, defibrotide did not blunt the antitumour effect of several 
cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, such as dexamethasone or the proteosome inhibitor bortezomib 
(Mitsiades 2009). 
Since defibrotide has been considered a potential therapeutic agent for use in thrombosis, several 
studies have been conducted to evaluate its concomitant administration with other antithrombotic 
drugs. (heparin, molsidomin, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), Daltroban and the fibrinolytic inhibitor 
tranexamic acid). In these studies, defibrotide generally enhanced the anticoagulant activity of 
heparin but did not affect the activity of other antithrombotic drugs.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Defibrotide is a polydisperse collection of predominantly single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides, 
as a result, the product is rapidly degraded in vivo and posed problems in detecting in ADME studies. 
Single dose studies were performed in mice, rats and rabbits to assess the pharmacokinetics of 
defibrotide. Systemic exposure to defibrotide was determined in toxicokinetic studies as part of 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. 
Methods of Analysis 
The older studies conducted with defibrotide and which pre-date the implementation of GLP 
standards, used a colorimetric assay of the 2’-deoxyribose carbohydrate moiety or measured 125I 
after administration of labelled defibrotide, to detect sample levels of defibrotide. These methods both 
lack the ability to distinguish between intact defibrotide and degraded defibrotide. Studies on 
distribution, metabolism and excretion were performed using 125I-labelled defibrotide. In recent 
studies a HPLC-UV method, determining intact defibrotide, was used.  
Absorption  
Defibrotide is intended for intravenous infusion and therefore no specific studies have been 
performed to study absorption of the product. 
Rats were given defibrotide by continuous iv infusion for 9 weeks. Dogs were given defibrotide by 
i.v. infusion of 2 h duration every 6 hours 4 times daily for 13 weeks. No evidence for accumulation 
of defibrotide in plasma was observed in either species after multiple dosing, nor was this seen in 
the extended length studies for rats and dogs. There were short plasma half-lives in all  the three 
species, ranging from 11 to 16 min. This was not seen in juvenile rats, where the half-life was 
substantially increased to 33 to 51 min. 
Distribution  
Tissue distribution was measured as total radioactivity and after single i.v. and oral administration 
of 125I-defibrotide to albino and pigmented rats. Radio-labelled defibrotide showed preferential 
distribution into highly perfused tissues: kidneys, liver, bone marrow, spleen and small intestine 
with lower levels in rat testes and low levels to the brain and to fat. There was higher distribution to 
pigmented skin that may indicate a tendency to bind to melanin. Protein binding assays showed 
that defibrotide does not bind to plasma proteins. 
Metabolism 
Limited data on the metabolism of defibrotide have been presented, and it is stated that defibrotide 
is rapidly degraded to 6-deoxyribose and purine and pyrimidine bases following administration. One 
in vitro metabolism study using human hepatocytes from 5 month, 2 year old and adult donors did 
not reveal any detectable metabolite products of defibrotide. The extent of data on metabolism is 
acceptable for this kind of substance. No appreciable in vitro metabolism of defibrotide by 
hepatocytes was observed. 
The in vivo metabolism in rabbits was assessed by plasma analysis following defibrotide 
administration by iv infusion for 2h, 4 times over a period of 24 h at 320 mg/kg/day. The in vivo 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 20/135 
 
 
  
  
study demonstrated the occurrence of nucleotides and nucleosides with free bases, resulting from 
the expected enzymatic degradation of the single-stranded DNA. 
Elimination  
Defibrotide is likely to be rapidly degraded to its constituent moieties following administration. 
Excretion in rats is mainly via urine and was very rapid. The majority of administered radioactive 
defibrotide was excreted by 24 hours post-dosing. 
Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions 
One in vitro study in human liver microsomes has been conducted to assess the potential of 
defibrotide to inhibit common cytochrome P450 enzymes and no inhibitory effect was observed. The 
lack of in vivo interaction studies is acceptable for this type of substance.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The legacy studies with defibrotide utilise single oral (to mice and rats), i.v. (to mice, rats, rabbits 
and dogs) or i.p. (to mice, rats and dogs) administrations. When using i.v. bolus, ≤1000 mg/kg 
dose levels of defibrotide are used. These doses are lower than the doses used in repeat-dose 
toxicity studies and so their applicability to the safety review for defibrotide is limited. 
In a dose range finding study in rats, the dose of 4800mg/kg/day was administered and tolerated 
for 7 days. This dose was considered the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), even though adverse 
effects due to defibrotide were not seen. The use of dose levels higher than 5 g/day was generally 
considered as unethical and the need to run a single dose study was considered as not necessary.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
A number of studies have been conducted in rats (7 days, 4 weeks and 13 weeks: reduced to 9 
weeks), rabbits (21 days: reduced to 17 days) and dogs (7 days, 13 weeks and 26 weeks). There 
were no apparent treatment related effects for weight gain, food intake or for clinical signs. Animals 
were dosed intravenously at doses ranging from 80 to 4800 mg/kg/day (rats, equivalent multiple of 
HED up to 31); 900 mg/kg (rabbits dosed by slow i.v. infusions of 6 hours for 21 days, equivalent 
multiple of HED of 11); and 15 to 1600 mg/kg/day (dogs, equivalent multiple of HED up to 35). 
Of the 8 studies three pre-date implementation of GLP standards: 4 weeks in rats and 13/26 weeks 
in dogs. 
In rats, the 13-week continuous infusion study was however interrupted after 9 weeks due to high 
mortality. The mortality was mostly related to complications resulting from the infusion procedure. 
Although mortality was higher in defibrotide treated animals, no firm conclusions on the 
toxicological properties of defibrotide can be drawn. Liver and kidney were identified as potential 
target organs. The findings may however to a large extent be related to indirect effects from the 
infusion procedure, most importantly infections. 
In dogs, a 7 day study with 2h infusion four times daily did not reveal any toxicity. Haematological 
tests in the 13 week study showed decreased erythrocytes, haemoglobin, and haematocrit, and 
prolonged APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) and PT (prothrombin time), as seen in the 
rat study. As was seen in the rat, there was mild Kupffer cell hypertrophy (male and female) – 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 21/135 
 
  
  
vacuolated macrophages, and minimal sub-acute inflammation (males). The Kupffer cell related 
effects are likely due to uptake of defibrotide. There were no adverse effects on body weight, or food 
intake, urinalysis or clinical chemistry apart from a dose-dependent increase in alanine 
aminotransferase and the discussed haematological changes. No NOEL could be determined for 
female dogs, though for male dogs this was 60 mg/kg/day. 
TK (toxicokinetic) parameters showed that there was increased exposure to defibrotide with 
increasing dose, and no difference between gender.  
Genotoxicity 
In vitro 
A GLP compliant study was performed to determine the potential of defibrotide to induce mutations 
in the required 5 bacterial strains of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98 and 
TA100 and the tryptophan operon of Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA. The results of the bacterial 
reverse mutation test with defibrotide, with or without exogenous rat liver S9 fraction, used to 
induce metabolic activation, demonstrated no dose related and reproducible increases in revertant 
colony numbers at any dose or in any of the bacterial strains tested.   
In vivo 
An in vivo mouse micronucleus test (GLP-compliant) was performed. The applicant used groups of 
5 male and 5 female Swiss Crl: CD1(ICR) mice were treated i.p. on two successive days with 
defibrotide at doses of 250, 833 and 2500 mg/kg. No significant increase in the incidence of 
micronucleated PCEs (polychromatic erythrocytes) were found in either males or females at all 
doses, compared with vehicle treated animals. 
Carcinogenicity 
Two studies in mice and rats were conducted to review the potential long-term/carcinogenicity 
effects of defibrotide. The studies were performed to GLP standards and used the oral route of 
administration. Defibrotide was administered to groups of 50 males and 50 females at doses of 100, 
400 and 2000 mg/kg/day to both mice and rats. As this is not the clinical method of administration 
for the product and the relative defibrotide exposure would be substantially less, there are very 
limited conclusions to be drawn from these studies. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic 
potential from these studies.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies on fertility and general reproductive performance, embryo-fetal development, and peri- 
and postnatal development were performed in 1975-1976 to support the original anti-thrombosis 
indication. These studies were performed with i.v. bolus or i.m. (intramuscular) injection.  
To support the current indication, studies were performed on embryo-fetal development with i.v. 
infusion and at higher doses than in previous studies. Pregnant rats were administered with 240, 
1200 and 4800 mg/kg/day by continuous infusion over 24 h. Due to an excessive toxicity observed 
at these dosages, 3 additional groups of 8 mated females were dosed at 60, 120 and 240 
mg/kg/day by 2 h infusion followed by 4 h interval 4 times a day. Pregnant rabbits were given 30, 
60 and 120 mg/kg/day from gestation Day 6 to Day 18 by 2 h infusion followed by 4 h wash-out 
periods, 4 times a day. Defibrotide was associated with strong maternal toxicity in both rats and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 22/135 
 
  
  
rabbits when given by infusion. Therefore, effects on embryo-fetal development could not be 
evaluated. The applicant has stated that the results from 13 week repeat dose studies in the rat and 
dog at doses of 240, 1200, and 4800 mg/kg/day and 60, 300 and 1600 mg/kg/day, respectively 
revealed no observed effect on sexual organs for either sex or species.  
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed as part of repeat dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and rabbits. In 
infusion studies in rats and rabbits there were reactions at the injection site. These were seen both 
in control and treated animals and were considered related to the infusion procedure rather than to 
defibrotide. Local tolerance in patients was reported to be generally good so the relevance of these 
animal findings is limited. 
Other toxicity studies 
The antigenicity and the potential of defibrotide to elicit anti-drug antibodies was assessed by 
testing rat and dog plasma samples generated in the repeat dose 13-week toxicity studies. The 
applicant has also summarised three further studies conducted in their earlier development 
package that can also be regarded as supportive. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has not performed an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) in accordance with the 
“Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of the medicinal products for human use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)”. Defibrotide is argued to be a naturally derived substance and is a 
characterised polydisperse collection of the sodium salt of predominantly single-stranded 
oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The substance, similarly to vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, 
peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, is exempted from ERA requirements in the EU 
Guideline because these substances are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
Further discussion on the metabolic fate of defibrotide suggests that the metabolic products are 
already ubiquitous in the environment.  
The drug substance, defibrotide, is designated an orphan drug status by the European Medicines 
Agency indicated for hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). VOD is almost exclusively associated 
with the conditioning regimens prior to stem cell transplantation (SCT), with 5 – 60% of recipients 
going on to develop VOD.  The prevalence of SCT per 10000 in the EU was 0.449 and 0.177 for 
allogeneic SCT, i.e those at highest risk of developing VOD (Gratwhol 2010). These prevalence 
figures have been used to estimate potential environmental exposure in a Phase I ERA. 
Assuming 100% market penetration, maximum daily administration of 25 mg/kg of defibrotide to 
60 kg, the predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PEC surfacewater) is calculated 
as 0.03 µg/L for total SCT and 0.01 µg/L for allogeneic SCT (see Table 5). When assuming 60% 
market penetration (based on maximum number patients undergoing SCT and likely to develop 
VOD), PEC surfacewater is estimated as 0.02 µg/L for total SCT and 0.007 µg/L for allogeneic SCT. 
Therefore, due to the medicinal product`s naturally occurring components and the controlled use of 
defibrotide in transplant units, the risk posed to the environment is negligible and further Phase II 
studies were not required.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A clear mechanism of action has not been convincingly established. No secondary 
pharmacodynamic studies were conducted by the applicant. Safety Pharmacology studies did not 
highlight any potential concern. Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies highlighted a potential 
to enhance antithrombotic activity of heparin. 
The pharmacokinetics of defibrotide was studied in vivo in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs and also by 
in vitro cell models. These studies indicate that defibrotide is limited in accumulation and is rapidly 
degraded by nucleases as would be expected for single-stranded DNA. Elimination is rapid mainly 
via urine and defibrotide exhibited no inhibitory effects to a range of common cytochrome P450 
enzymes. 
To support the current application, single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in 
rats and dogs with intravenous infusion.  
In repeat-dose toxicity studies performed by the applicant in rats no clear evidence for toxicity was 
observed. In dogs, there was an increase in liver weight and some microscopic findings (minimal to 
mild Kupffer cell hypertrophy, minimal subacute inflammation, mild individual hepatocellular 
necrosis) with uncertain toxicological significance but probably caused by cellular uptake of 
defibrotide. Defibrotide was not genotoxic based on a study on gene mutations in bacteria and a 
micronucleus test in mice. Defibrotide has previously been shown not to be carcinogenic in oral 
studies in rats and mice. 
To support the current indication, studies were performed on embryofoetal development with i.v. 
infusion in rats and rabbits. Defibrotide was associated with strong maternal toxicity with high 
mortality in both rats and rabbits when given by infusion, and there were no or very few foetuses. 
These studies provided very limited information about defibrotide effects on embryo-foetal 
development as they could not be evaluated; the studies performed were also non GLP-compliant. 
Studies were performed in the 1970’s to evaluate effects on immune functions. Mice were treated 
orally or i.p. daily (5 days a week) for 4 weeks and a number of functional assays were performed 
(NK cell activity, anti-SRBC antibody response, macrophage cytotoxicity, lymphocyte proliferation). 
No clear effect on immune functions was observed.

The substance, similarly to vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates 
and lipids, are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant provided a non-clinical program consisting of studies using intravenous infusion as 
route of administration, together with bibliographic data.  
Based on the provided data, the CHMP concluded that the pharmacological rationale for the use of 
defibrotide has not been established; therefore, no extrapolations to clinical data can be made 
based on “pharmacological plausibility”. The pharmacokinetic and toxicological aspects of the 
non-clinical dossier are limited in their relevance to this application and a number of the older 
studies presented pre-date GLP.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The applicant states that all clinical studies assessing the efficacy and safety of defibrotide were 
conducted according to GCP and in accord with local and international regulations. Clinical trials 
carried out outside the European Union are stated to have met the ethical requirements of Directive 
2001/20/EC. 
In view of the small data set and the open-label nature of the two pivotal trials, a GCP inspection 
was recommended by CHMP at D180. 
The results of the relevant inspection are detailed below in the discussion section in each of the 
inspected studies.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The main PK study was study R09-1425. This was a double-blind randomized 4-way crossover trial 
to define PK and the ECG effects of defibrotide using a clinical and a supratherapeutic dose 
compared to placebo and moxifloxacin (a positive control) in healthy adults. Study RO9-1425 was 
conducted between May-June 2010.  It should be noted that only a single batch of defibrotide was 
used for this study. 
The study included 52 healthy male and female subjects who received each of four treatment 
regimens separated by a three day washout period. The four treatments were: 
(A) therapeutic doses of 6.25 mg/kg defibrotide delivered in a single 2-hour IV infusion,  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 26/135 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
(B) supratherapeutic doses of 15 mg/kg defibrotide delivered in a single 2-hour IV infusion,  
(C) placebo dose of 5% dextrose water and  
(D) moxifloxacin delivered in a single oral 400 mg tablet.  
Table 6 
Defibrotide Pharmacokinetics: R09-1425 
For both defibrotide doses, Tmax was at approximately the end of each infusion. Cmax and AUC 
values were approximately dose related. Terminal half-lives (T1/2) were calculated at 0.71 hours 
and 0.45 hours for the therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses, respectively.  
The time course of defibrotide clearance for the two test doses (Figure 1) illustrates the rapid 
clearance after the 2-hour infusion is completed. Given this evidence of very rapid clearance of 
defibrotide, it is anticipated that the standard therapeutic regimen [four times a day (QID) dosing 
for several consecutive days] would not result in any accumulation in healthy controls with normal 
renal function.

The volume of distribution of 6.1 ±2 L at the high dose of 15mg/kg is consistent with the 
intravascular compartment.  A volume of distribution of 9.9 ±3 L was noted at the lower and 
proposed therapeutic dose of 6.25mg/kg.  
Elimination  
The elimination of defibrotide has not been thoroughly elucidated; however, being an 
oligonucleotide mixture, detailed information was not requested. Defibrotide is likely rapidly 
degraded to its constituent moieties following administration. From study R09-1425 the urinary 
clearance of defibrotide was relatively rapid, with the majority of study drug (>98% of that excreted 
from the therapeutic dose administration and >97% from the supratherapeutic dose) detected in 
urine during the first collection period of 0-4 hours. Higher exposure and prolonged elimination can 
be expected in patients with renal impairment. In view of the trend for a dose-related toxicity in 
terms of increased bleeding events and the increased mortality in children receiving high dose 
defibrotide in study 99-118, the lack of PK in children and in those with renal impairment remains 
a major concern. 
Limited data on the metabolism of defibrotide have been presented, and it is stated that defibrotide 
is rapidly degraded to 6-deoxyribose and purine and pyrimidine bases following administration. One 
in vitro metabolism study using human hepatocytes from 5 month, 2 year old and adult donors did 
not reveal any detectable metabolite products of defibrotide. The extent of data on metabolism is 
acceptable for this kind of substance. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population  
Study DFPK 99-118 (substudy of Study 99-118) was performed in 11 adults with VOD. This was a 
substudy of the main dose-finding study for defibrotide.  
The PK data from DFPK 99-118 cannot be considered to provide reliable information on the PK of 
defibrotide in adult VOD patients for the following reasons. 
The PK was limited to 11 subjects; 5 in arm A and 6 in arm B in adults (18-46 years) only with 
severe VOD. No data on children or in special populations with VOD was provided. No data on 
urinary DF concentrations was collected. In addition the requirement for re-analysis of several 
samples raises doubts about the accuracy of the results. An additional concern with this study was 
that the samples were 3-10 years old before they were analysed by HPLC for defibrotide levels. 
From DFPK99-118 overall the number of samples contributing to each data point is between 4 and 
5. Although the half-life and volume of distribution were broadly similar to the PK study in healthy 
adults, high CVs were noted. The exposure at the applied dose of 6.25 mg/kg was higher in VOD 
patients compared healthy volunteers and it cannot be excluded that the difference is larger, due to 
stability problems, e.g. if the concentrations in VOD patients are underestimated. The estimated 
half-lives were somewhat longer in VOD patients.   
VOD, if severe, can be associated with multiorgan failure, including hepatorenal syndrome. Thus, 
the target population may have both impaired hepatic and renal function. No dose adjustment is 
considered necessary by the applicant for patients with hepatic or renal impairment but no 
pharmacokinetic data are available to support these recommendations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 28/135 
 
  
  
Defibrotide is dosed based on weight but the effect of weight on PK parameters has not been 
assessed. From a pharmacokinetic point of view it is difficult to assess whether the weight-based 
dosage is adequate, e.g. in obese patients.  
Data from healthy volunteers suggest no relevant gender difference in the pharmacokinetics of 
defibrotide. 
In the paediatric population, there is no PK support for the safe use of defibrotide due to the lack of 
PK data. Hence, the applicant proposes that the posology in this group has to rely upon available 
clinical efficacy and safety data and that this also applies to elderly subjects. 
Far more robust PK data is required for patients with VOD, for those with renal impairment and 
particularly PK in children is required. The statistically significant elevated mortality in children 
receiving the high dose of defibrotide in study 99-118 raises the need for PK data in children. Higher 
exposure is expected in renal impairment due to the renal excretion of defibrotide, and this 
combined with the observation of increased bleeding events being commoner in those on high dose 
defibrotide from the compassionate use programme (DF-CUP) further highlights the need for 
adequate PK data. In view of the lack of PK data to support the dose chosen together with the lack 
of clearly demonstrated efficacy, the absence of PK data in children and the lack of sufficient PK data 
in renal failure are considered serious deficiencies. This is particularly important considering the 
proposed indication which includes children and for those with severe VOD will also include subjects 
with renal impairment. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies  
Only one dose level is recommended for Defitelio, i.e. 25 mg/kg/day divided in four doses per day. 
Some information about dose proportionality can be obtained from study R09-1425, in which doses 
of 6.25 and 15 mg/kg were administered.  The increases in AUC0-t and Cmax were greater than dose 
proportional (3.5 and 3.9-fold, respectively), while AUCinf increased proportional to the increase in 
dose. AUCinf could not be accurately estimated in several individuals, however. Also in study 99-118 
conducted in VOD patients, different dose levels were administered. These data indicate no major 
deviations from dose proportionality, although the data should be interpreted with caution due to 
the potential stability problems and small numbers of individuals in each group in study 99-118. 
PK data from up to 7 days of treatment with defibrotide were available in the VOD study 99-118. 
These limited data indicate no obvious changes in the pharmacokinetics of defibrotide over a 7-day 
period. It can, however, be expected that the pharmacokinetics could change over time to some 
extent if the organ function and general status of the patient changes over time, due to 
improvement or worsening of the VOD condition.  
In healthy volunteers, the variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters of defibrotide was low (CVs 
15-20%). In VOD patients, the CVs were generally in the range 30-60% for Cmax and AUC values, 
although higher values were observed. The number of subjects in each dose group of VOD was very 
small, though. No data are presented on intra-individual variability. 
Special populations 
The number of subjects with pharmacokinetic data in the target population, VOD patients, is small 
(n=11) and no pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted with defibrotide in special 
populations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012

Data from healthy volunteers suggest no relevant gender difference in the pharmacokinetics of 
defibrotide. In the paediatric population, there is no pharmacokinetic support for the safe use of 
defibrotide due to the lack of data. Hence, the proposed posology in this group has to rely upon 
available clinical efficacy and safety data. This also applies to elderly subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
One in vitro study in human liver microsomes has been conducted to assess the potential of 
defibrotide to inhibit common cytochrome P450 enzymes and no inhibitory effect was observed. The 
lack of in vivo interaction studies is acceptable for this type of substance. The potency assays 
provided by the company included several profibrinolytic activity assays which measure 
profibrinolytic activity. Therefore pharmacodynamic interactions with other drugs with 
anticoagulant properties may occur. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Multiple proposed mechanisms (MoA) of action for defibrotide were claimed. 
One of the MoA describes that defibrotide primarily targets endothelium, particularly of small 
vessels and appears to modulate endothelial cell injury. Clinical studies have described that 
defibrotide: 
(a) protects endothelial cells against chemotherapy-induced cell death and activation; 
(b) promotes fibrinolysis via up-regulation of Tissue Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) and Tissue Factor 
Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI), and increasing the plasmin activity without activating plasminogen to 
plasmin; 
(c) reduces circulating levels of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1); 
(d) decreases expression of cell surface adhesion molecules (e.g. P-selectin and intercellular 
adhesion molecule-1) on activated endothelial cells; 
(e) down-regulates the gene expression, protein level and activity of heparanase, inflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines in activated endothelial cells but without modulating the gene expression 
profile of endothelial cells under normal conditions. 
However the review of the literature data provided in support of the various proposed MoA for 
defibrotide were found not be of adequate quality as the methodology used were not described 
adequately and many reports had conflicting results. This was further complicated by the fact that 
the defibrotide used was not always the defibrotide that is the subject of this MAA, namely of 
porcine intestinal origin - the source of the defibrotide in many papers referred to defibrotide as of 
mammalian lung/bovine lung origin. This casts further doubt on the relevance of the literature for 
providing useful information on the PD effects of defibrotide. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The applicant provided PD measurement in the dose-finding study in VOD patients (99-118) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 30/135 
 
 
  
  
the PD marker measured was PAI-1. PAI-1 levels are known to be raised in VOD and the 
applicant’s position is that the rise in PAI-1 is reduced with defibrotide treatment. 
Pharmacodynamic Analyses from study 99-118 
Study 99-118 was an open-label randomised phase II study to determine the effective dose and is 
the only dose-finding study provided by the applicant. 
Study subjects were defined as those with severe VOD (defined as VOD with associated renal, 
pulmonary and/or CNS dysfunction) or at least a 30% risk for severe VOD based on the Bearman 
model following HSCT. 
For both arms, the starting dose of defibrotide on Day 1 was 2.5 mg/kg every 6 hours (Q6H) for four 
doses (total dose 10 mg/kg), based on baseline weight. From Day 2, the defibrotide dose was 
increased to 6.25 mg/kg Q6H (total dose 25 mg/kg/day; Arm A), or 10 mg/kg Q6H (total dose 40 
mg/kg/day; Arm B). There were 75 patients in Arm A and 74 patients in Arm B. 
Laboratory tests (primarily of coagulation parameters) were serially obtained, starting at study 
entry and performed twice weekly while on defibrotide. Results of these analyses are considered 
exploratory and were not provided by the applicant. Both PAI-1 and total bilirubin levels were 
observed to change with defibrotide treatment (Figure 2). This figure demonstrates PAI-1 levels (A) 
and total bilirubin levels (B) in those patients with a complete response (CR) compared to patients 
who were non-responders, patients who survived by Day+100 post-SCT compared to those 
patients who did not survive, and by treatment arm. PAI-1 and other selected laboratory 
parameters were summarized at baseline, Day 7, and Day 14 of treatment; changes from baseline 
to Days 7 and 14 were reported.

Page 31/135 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Figure 2 
Mean (SD) PAI-1 (A) and total bilirubin (B) by treatment arm and 
outcome 
There were no statistically significant differences in mean PAI-1 levels by dose group, between 
patients with or without CR, or between patients alive or dead at Day+100. Mean PAI-1 levels at 
Days 7 and 14 were lower, although this result did not reach statistical significance when 
compared to baseline in patients with CR and those who were alive at Day+100, with a similar 
pattern observed in both treatment arms. 
Secondary pharmacology 
A QT study was conducted (R09-1425) by the applicant. The moxifloxacin positive control group 
showed the expected small change in QTc duration. The results of this ECG trial showed no signal of 
any effect on heart rate, AV conduction or cardiac depolarization as measured by the PR and QRS 
interval durations. The results from Study R09-1425 demonstrated that defibrotide had no effects 
on heart rate, PR and QRS interval duration or cardiac morphology. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 32/135 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic analysis showed that defibrotide did not affect cardiac 
repolarization. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Only limited human pharmacokinetic data are available for defibrotide. The only reliable PK data is 
from study R09-1425 in healthy adults, and this was performed with a single batch of defibrotide. 
The PK data from DFPK 99-118 is very limited in terms of the number (less than 5 subjects 
contributed to most time points) and the samples were up to 10 years old but validated stability of 
the samples was only to 325 days, thereby further weakening the obtained results. As defibrotide is 
renally excreted, a higher exposure is expected in patients with renal failure. As there was a trend 
for increased bleeding events in the defibrotide compassionate use programmed (DF-CUP) for 
subjects receiving higher doses this remains an issue.  
The absence of any PK data in children is not acceptable in view of the higher mortality for children 
in study 99-118 in the high dose arm. Pharmacokinetic data can thus not give support for dose 
recommendations in special populations, e.g. paediatrics and for those with renal impairment 
(which will be present in many cases of severe VOD). 
Regarding secondary PD effects, a QT study was conducted, R09-1425. This study did not detect 
any effects on heart rate, AV conduction, cardiac depolarisation, or repolarisation, and no clinically 
relevant changes on heart function.  
It can therefore be concluded that no clinical pharmacodynamic effects have been demonstrated for 
defibrotide. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK data provided by the applicant are considered seriously deficient and do not support dose 
recommendations in special populations, e.g. paediatrics and those with renal impairment. PK data 
was provided for healthy volunteers with only a single batch of product. Data for PK in children and 
PK in renal failure are considered by the CHMP as important missing information. This is particularly 
significant considering the increased mortality in children receiving the high dose in study 99-118. 
In addition, as defibrotide is renally excreted, higher exposure in those with renal impairment is 
likely. These concerns are relevant in view of the proposed indication which will include children and 
renal impairment and constitutes an unresolved PK issue. No PD effects have been demonstrated 
for defibrotide.

Defibrotide for hematopoietic SCT Patients with severe VOD: A Randomized Phase II Study to 
Determine the Effective Dose. 
This was a randomised, open label, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial conducted at 9 medical centres 
in the US between April 2000-May 2007 to determine the safety and efficacy of two doses of 
defibrotide (25 and 40 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses, Arms A (n=75, ITT) and B (n=74, ITT), 
respectively) for the treatment of severe VOD in hematopoietic SCT patients.

Adult and paediatric patients were defined as those with severe VOD (defined as VOD with 
associated renal, pulmonary and/or CNS dysfunction) or at least a 30% risk for developing severe 
VOD based on the Bearman model following HSCT. All of the patients in Study 99-118 had 
diagnosed VOD at study entry, the majority of which had MOF [96% (72/75) in Arm A, 93% (69/74) 
in Arm B]. Of the 8 patients without multi organ failure (3 in Arm A, 5 in Arm B) who had Bearman 
risk of developing severe VOD (Bearman risk 30-60), 8/8 (100%) subsequently developed MOF 
within 1-11 days (median 4 days). 
Endpoints 
The primary objective was to determine the complete response (CR) rate of severe VOD (total 
bilirubin less than 2 mg/dL and resolution of MOF) treated with defibrotide in the two dose groups. 
CR was defined as bilirubin <2 mg/dL after initiation of defibrotide (regardless of whether treatment 
was ongoing or completed).  
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
To catalogue the possible toxicity of defibrotide used in this setting, including Grade 3-4 
• 
• 
• 
• 
toxicities and all grade toxicity; 
To determine the effect of defibrotide on PAI-1; 
To investigate whether there appears to be a dose relationship between defibrotide and/or 
Day +100 mortality in PAI-1 levels in these patients; 
To determine if one dose has a trend toward a higher therapeutic effect on Day +100 
survival post-SCT in the study population; 
To determine the feasibility of pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis across the two dose arms in a 
subset of patients and generate descriptive data of the PK of defibrotide in the study 
population.

Subjects 
Treatments 
Two doses of defibrotide (25 and 40 mg/kg/day, Arms A and B, respectively) for the treatment of 
severe VOD in hematopoietic SCT patients were administered to patients. Randomization was 
stratified by whether patients’ conditioning regimen included cyclophosphamide and patient age 
(>18 years versus ≤18 years). 
Defibrotide treatment was recommended for a minimum or 14 days or until the time of complete 
response, progression of hepatic VOD, or unacceptable toxicity. 
Results 
The results on the primary efficacy variable showed that thirty-two patients (43%) of Arm A and 29 
patients (39%) in Arm B were considered to have had a CR. The difference between the two groups 
was not statistically significant with a p-value of 0.7397 (Fisher exact test). Table 9 provide the 
overall summary of CR in severe VOD with 95% CI.

Comparison of the time to CR demonstrates no difference between the two dose groups. The 
median time to CR for those patients who achieved a CR equalled 40.5 days and 44.0 days, 
respectively for Arms A and B. 
Secondary explorative analyses showed  
• 
There were no statistically significant findings for any subgroup analysis (ventilator and/or 
dialysis dependence at study entry; age, type of CST or number of prior SCTs). 
•  Arm A children (age ≤16) may have demonstrated a slight trend to higher CR rate 
compared to Arm B children (64% versus 43%; p-value 0.2362 Fisher exact test); a similar 
trend was observed in children when defined as age ≤18 (60% versus 42%; p-value 0.2668, 
Fisher exact test) 
The difference in CR in those less than 16 years in Arm A compared with Arm B in favour of the lower 
dose suggests that either this is a chance finding in view of the small absolute numbers or that 
toxicity is higher at dose B in children only (as a similar trend was not seen for those over 18 years).   
In a similar manner to that for the CR analysis, multiple subgroups analyses were performed for 
Day+100 survival. Key summary points from these secondary explorative analyses include: 
For children (whether defined as ≤16 or ≤18 years old) Kaplan-Meier estimates for survival at day 
100 were 68.2% in Arm A versus 32.5% in Arm B for the ≤16 years subgroup and 64.0% in Arm A 
versus 32.5% in Arm B for the ≤18 years subgroup (p-value= 0.0259; p-value= 0.0275 
respectively, log-rank test). No other significant trends noted from the subgroup analyses. 
From the two doses used in study 99-118, the efficacy results are poorer in the high dose group 
particularly in children. This raises serious concerns about the efficacy/safety and PK in children 
particularly for a product where the mechanism of action is poorly defined and can only be 
considered to be that of a weak profibrinolytic. This is particularly noted in the KM estimates for 
survival in those under the age of 16 years and also in those less than 18 years. 
Conclusion 
Given the similar results in terms of CR and D100+ survival and the similar overall (combined adults 
and children) safety profile in the two treatments arms the applicant concluded that the lower, 25 
mg/kg/day dose would be explored further in a controlled phase 3 trial. Although the inclusion 
criteria and the definition of CR differed from those used in the 2005-01 study, the decision to 
choose the 25 mg/kg/day level for further investigations is considered appropriate.

than 2 mg/dL and resolution of MOF) by Day+100 post-SCT compared with a historical control 
group. The study was performed between July 2006-November 2008. 
Study Participants  
The Treatment group (TG) included the following: 
Eligible subjects included those who had a clinical diagnosis of VOD by Day+21 post-SCT (defined 
by jaundice (bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL) and at least 2 of the following clinical findings: ascites, weight gain 
≥5% above baseline weight and/or hepatomegaly.  
In addition, an eligible subject must have severe VOD, defined as VOD with multi-organ failure 
(MOF); MOF is defined as the presence of one or both of the following by Day+28 post-SCT: 
•  Renal dysfunction:  
a)  serum creatinine ≥3x value on the date of admission to the SCT unit for 
conditioning or ≥3x lowest value during conditioning prior to SCT (whichever is 
lowest); or  
b)  creatinine clearance or GFR ≤40% of admission value; or  
c)  dialysis dependence; 
•  Pulmonary dysfunction: 
a)  documentation of oxygen saturation ≤90% on room air (two consecutive 
measurements at least one hour apart) or  
b)  requirement for oxygen supplementation/ventilator dependence. 
In this trial 2005-01 both adults and children are included and all had MOF.   
The historical control group (HC) were chosen from multiple retrospective case note reviews and 
the number and characteristics of the patients included in the HC were amended during the trial. 
Treatments 
The HC group did not receive defibrotide. 
All patients enrolled in the treatment group (TG) received 25 mg/kg/day of intravenous defibrotide 
given in 4 divided doses (approximately every 6 hours) at a maximum concentration of 4 mg/mL, 
each infused over 2 hours. Defibrotide was recommended to be administered for a minimum of 21 
days.  
Thereafter treatment was continued, as circumstances allowed, until the patient was discharged 
from the hospital. Defibrotide administration could be held for toxicity or delayed for necessary 
medical/surgical interventions. If the patient required re-hospitalization, treatment with defibrotide 
could be reinitiated. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of defibrotide in patients with severe VOD in 
terms of Complete Response of severe VOD (total bilirubin less than 2 mg/dL and resolution of MOF) 
by Day+100 post-SCT as the primary parameter.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 38/135 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The secondary objectives were: 
•  To compare survival at 100 and 180 days following SCT in patients receiving Defibrotide to those 
in a Historical Control who did not receive defibrotide;  
•  To assess the safety of the selected dose and schedule; 
•  To collect and bank samples prior to and during therapy for special studies of potential serum 
and endothelial markers for VOD; 
•  To collect historical information about the treatment centres, including severe VOD treatment 
across hospitals and over time and number and type of transplants per year. 
It has to be noted that as the HC group notes were not assessable for safety in terms of identifying 
SAEs it is unclear how the applicant planned to meet the secondary objective of assessing the safety 
of the selected dose. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
This was a historically controlled, open label, multicentre, international, Phase III clinical trial to 
determine the safety and efficacy of 25 mg/kg/day of defibrotide for the treatment of severe VOD 
in hematopoietic SCT patients. In this study, the term “severe VOD” was applied to patients 
meeting the Baltimore diagnostic criteria for VOD (hyperbilirubinemia ≥ 2 mg/dL plus two of the 
following three criteria: ascites, ≥5% weight gain and hepatomegaly), who also have MOF (i.e., 
pulmonary and/or renal dysfunction). This represents a group of SCT patients in whom mortality at 
Day+100 has been shown to be 90-100%. 
The primary efficacy parameter was CR by Day+100 post-SCT, utilizing historical controls as a 
comparator. Secondary parameters included survival rate at 100 and 180 days post-SCT, time to 
CR, concordance of CR with survival, and analysis of special laboratory studies. 
Sample size 
The original trial planned to have 80 subjects in the TG and 80 in the HC. There were several 
amendments in the study whereby the HC group were reduced to 32 subjects and the TG was 
increased to 102. The ITT population were 102 patients in the treatment group and 32 patients in 
the historical control. 
In the Per Protocol population 61 patients were included in the treatment group and 32 patients in 
the historical control. Safety population 102 patients were included in the treatment group and 32 
patients in the historical control. 
Statistical methods 
The final primary endpoint was incidence of Complete Response (CR) at by Day 100 post-SCT 
regardless of whether defibrotide treatment is ongoing or completed at the time of CR. The initial 
primary endpoint chosen by the Applicant was Mortality at Day 100. This amendment was made on 
3rd December 2007. This was before the first interim analysis formally took place at the DSMB.

The DSMB were concerned with the gross imbalance between the 2 arms for the Steinbach site, as 
well as the high proportion of historical arm patients from this centre. The DSMB was also concerned 
with the inclusion/exclusion criteria violators by study centre.  
2nd DSMB 
At the 2nd DSMB, the DSMB recommended that the steering committee confirm the criteria used to 
select historical controls and the practical application of those criteria to guarantee that the 
historical patients match the patients in the prospective study arm. At the time of the second DSMB 
meeting, 3 patients (out of 46) in the defibrotide arm, and 0, out of 86 in the historical control arm 
were considered to have failed the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Fifty-four SCT patient medical charts 
were excluded following review by the independent MRC which was blinded to outcome, as 
symptoms of VOD and/or MOF were considered to be secondary to an alternate cause. 
The results of the interim analysis raise serious concerns about the validity of the results. If the 
enrolled defibrotide population were in general less ill than the historical control arm this would 
clearly bias the results in favour of defibrotide. The applicant reviewed the patients in the TG group 
and identified 4 subjects whose symptoms were eventually considered to be attributable to other 
aetiologies. This large difference in those excluded from the HC as compared with the TG following 
inclusion in the study highlights the problems with use of a revised HC group. 
Changes to the protocol – March 2006 
Two entry criteria were amended for the Historical Control: 
Hemodynamic instability was added as an exclusion criterion to the historical control group in order 
to make the treatment and control arms more comparable. 
Two additional stratification variables were included: allogeneic transplant versus autologous 
transplant; prior stem cell transplant (yes/no). These two variables (expected to produce worse 
patient outcome) were incorporated in order to assure balance between treatment and historical 
control groups. The protocol therefore incorporated a total of four dichotomous stratification 
variables.  
The Statistical Analysis section was amended. 
No change was made to the primary efficacy analysis (comparison of survival at Day 100 between 
the Treatment Group and Historical Control using a 99% CI). The amendment clarified that a log 
rank test of the two survival curves over the duration of the study would be a secondary analysis. 
Changes to the Protocol - December 2006 
The protocol revised the statistical analysis plan to include an alpha penalty to account for the 
interim analysis to be performed after 40 patients in the prospective group have been followed until 
Day 100.

In general, it appears that all 86 patients were in general well matched to the 46 patients on 
defibrotide in terms of diagnosis and baseline variables. Although the DSMB were surprised that the 
rate observed in these patients was not what they were expecting from the literature, there does 
not appear to be substantial evidence for any systematic differences between the populations.

Numbers analysed 
Three populations were defined for this study (intent-to-treat, Per Protocol and Safety). The 
intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set was the primary analysis set for all efficacy analyses, with 
secondary efficacy analysis performed on the Per Protocol analysis set. 
The ITT set for the Treatment Group consisted of all subjects who were consented to participate in 
the protocol. The ITT set for the Historical Control consisted of all subjects who were selected by the 
MRC as having severe VOD without any protocol exclusion criteria. The ITT analysis set was used for 
as the primary analysis set for the primary and all secondary efficacy variables. 
The Per Protocol (PP) analysis set for the Treatment Group consisted of all subjects in the intent-to- 
treat analysis set who received at least 21 days of defibrotide therapy. The PP analysis set for the 
Historical Control remained the same as for the ITT group. The PP analysis set was the secondary 
analysis set for all efficacy analyses. The safety analysis set consisted of all HC subjects and all TG 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of defibrotide.

GCP inspection findings 
The MRC process for selecting subjects into the historical control group was the key to the study 
2005-01.  The MRC process for selecting subjects in study 2005-01 into the historical control group 
was not fully GCP compliant. The selection process was not transparent; the rationale and evidence 
to support the decision was not consistently documented. It was noted that there was no 
independent documentation of what questions have been asked by the MRC, answers given by the 
independent physician and rationale for the final decision. The only documentation available was 
the conclusions recorded in the summary of patient review. In addition, the answers given by the 
independent physician were not verified. The findings in the selection process cause doubt on the 
objectiveness of the selection of the historical group against the treatment group. 
The failure in identifying suspected cases may have led to under reporting cases of VOD in the 
prophylaxis arm because only suspected cases in the control arm, given at least one dose of 
defibrotide were referred. The selection of the historical control group appeared to be more vigorous 
than the treatment group. The findings in the selection process cause doubt on the objectiveness of 
the selection of the historical group against the treatment group.

The original trial planned to have 80 subjects in the TG and 80 in the HC. The HC group was reduced 
to 32 subjects and the TG was increased to 102. 
As management and treatment improve year on year the use of a HC group is problematic. The 
problem of using a dated HC group for this trial remains a serious problem in terms of assessment 
of efficacy in view of the differences in overall clinical management over the last 17 years. 
Given this is an open label, historically controlled trial; the results rely heavily on the use of a finally 
chosen HC group of only 32 subjects.   
There is an additional serious concern regarding changing of the HC group from an initial HC group 
of 86 to the final chosen HC group of 32. The repeated alteration of the composition of the HC group 
during an ongoing open label study raises the serious risk that the finally chosen subset of HC 
patients had more severe characteristics than the TG. In addition, the stringency applied to finally 
ascribing an unequivocal diagnosis of VOD meant that the notes of these HC patients were reviewed 
over a period of time such that those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were, in many cases 
considered finally not to have VOD. This highly stringent selection of VOD cases from historical 
notes raises the problem that selection was not the same as for the TG. On reviewing the HC notes 
54/86 patients (63%) were considered ineligible whereas only 4 (4%) of the enrolled TG were 
ineligible. The decision to remove 54 patients from the historical control group is not supported. 
Fifty-one of these 54 patients met the inclusion criteria and thus would have been included in the 
defibrotide arm. By removing the least ill patients in the historical control group, a large bias in 
favour of defibrotide will be generated. 
The GCP non-compliance of the processes for and documentation of the removal of subjects from 
the HC group further impact on the acceptability of the small final HC group used.  
The GCP inspectors recommended sensitivity analysis of the original 86 HC subjects compared with 
the TG. This analysis shows no difference between treatment arms and no evidence of efficacy.

There are serious methodological flaws in this study that make it extremely difficult to quantify the 
benefits. This study is severely compromised by the changing of the HC group and therefore the 
efficacy data as presented by the applicant cannot be considered as robust evidence for an effect in 
the treatment indication for VOD. The GCP inspection raised a major issue on the process for and 
documentation of selection of the HC group. These GCP findings further question the utility of the 
small final HC chosen, as no efficacy was seen when the TG and 86 HC group were compared. 
In addition while the diagnosis of VOD was possible from the notes, the safety profile of the patients 
was not assessable. The absence of such safety data precludes any conclusions and raises concerns 
about the adequacy of the HC notes. The uncertainty regarding the comprehensiveness of the data 
from the clinical notes of the HC group raises concern for both diagnosis and safety data collection.  
In conclusion the results from the treatment study 2005-01 are not considered to provide adequate 
evidence for efficacy of defibrotide in the treatment indication. 
Additional Study in support of the treatment indication 
•  Protocol 2006-05 
Interim analysis of the 2006-05 phase III protocol: Defibrotide for Hematopoietic Stem Cell 
Transplant (SCT) Subjects with Severe Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD): A Treatment IND Study 
(Under 21 CFR 312.34); amended to enrol patients with VOD (without a requirement for associated 
multi-organ failure).This is a single arm, open label multi-centre study conducted in the US to 
provide defibrotide (25 mg/kg/day) to subjects diagnosed with VOD. Start date December 2007 
and trial is ongoing.  
Protocol 2006-05 is a prospective trial of defibrotide 25 mg/kg/day in adult and paediatric patients 
with a clinical diagnosis of severe hepatic VOD characterized by bilirubin >2 mg/dL and two or more 
of the following: ascites, weight gain >5% of baseline, hepatomegaly, or biopsy-proven hepatic 
VOD up to Day+35 after transplantation, and evidence of severe hepatic VOD based on 
development of pulmonary or renal dysfunction before Day+45.  
The design of protocol 2006-05 was similar to that of protocol 2005-01 (study 2005-01 described 
above), differing mainly by allowing inclusion of patients with late-onset severe hepatic VOD (VOD 
diagnosed to Day + 35 and MOF diagnosed to day + 45). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 46/135 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Treatments 
All subjects treated in the study received 25 mg/kg/day of intravenous defibrotide. Defibrotide was 
administered in 5% dextrose or saline in water IV given in 4 divided doses (approximately every 6 
hours) at a maximum concentration of 4 mg/mL, each infused over 2 hours for a minimum duration 
of 21 days. 
The principle parameters for clinical response were complete resolution of hepatic VOD/MOF and 
survival at Day+100. The primary efficacy variable, defined as complete response of hepatic VOD 
according to the definition used for study 2005-01, required that bilirubin improve to less than 2 
mg/dL with resolution of MOF. 
Objectives 
To provide defibrotide under 21 CFR 312.34 “Treatment use of an investigational new drug” to 
subjects with a diagnosis of severe VOD. 
The secondary objectives were: 
- To collect additional usage, tolerability and safety data from subjects with VOD. 
- To assess the outcome in subjects who met eligibility criteria for Study 2005-01.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy 
For all subjects enrolled into Protocol 2006-05, the percentage of subjects surviving to Day+100 
and Complete Response rates was calculated. 
For subjects enrolled into Protocol 2006-05 who met Protocol 2005-01 entry criteria, mortality at 
Day +100 and Complete Response (CR) rate at Day+100 was compared to the Historical Control 
arm of Protocol 2005-01. Complete Response was defined as the percentage of subjects who had a 
total bilirubin < 2 mg/dL and resolution of MOF (renal and/or pulmonary dysfunction, whether this 
existed at study entry or anytime on study). 
- Resolution of renal dysfunction was defined as a) serum creatinine < 1.5 times baseline or the 
upper limit of normal for the subjects age; AND CrCl and/or GFR > 80% of admission value (if 
available); OR For subjects who were dialysis dependent at study entry or became dialysis 
dependent at any point during the study, resolution of renal dysfunction is defined as 
independence from dialysis. 
- Resolution of pulmonary dysfunction was defined as documentation of oxygen saturation > 
90% on room air AND/OR oxygen supplementation no longer required/ resolution of ventilator 
dependence. 
Safety 
Safety assessments included clinical assessment of VOD and MOF, review for treatment emergent 
adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths and withdrawals due to toxicity.

the 2006-05 study who met eligibility criteria for Protocol 2005-01 (ITT200605AME1 2005-01) to 
the 32 Historical Control subjects from Protocol 2005-01. An interim analysis was performed based 
on a two sided 0.95 confidence interval (CI) of the difference between defibrotide and Historical 
Control Complete Response rate. 
Table 12 
Efficacy in Study 2006-05 
The complete response by day 100 is similar to that for Study 2005-01 and for the 86 HC patients 
used initially for the main treatment trial (2005-1). Further analyses against the 32 HC group finally 
chosen for study 2005-01 does not add value to this study as the problems with final 32 HC group 
have been highlighted above on review of study 2005-01 and the GCP inspectorate findings. This 
open label study 2006-05 is not considered to support the treatment indication.

Prevention Indication 
Main study EudraCT 2004-000592-33 
Methods 
This was a phase III randomised open-labelled study in paediatric patients undergoing SCT at high 
risk of VOD, conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of defibrotide versus no prophylactic 
treatment on the incidence and outcome of VOD. 
Treatments 
All patients randomized to the defibrotide Prophylaxis Arm received 25 mg/kg/day of defibrotide. 
Defibrotide was administered IV in 4 divided doses (approximately every 6 hours), each infused 
over 2 hours. For patients who did not develop symptoms of VOD, defibrotide was continued until 
Day+30 post-SCT or upon discharge from inpatient care (with a minimum treatment of 14 days).  
Patients randomized to the control arm who were diagnosed with VOD (at any point in the post-SCT 
course, including after Day+30) crossed-over to defibrotide, receiving the same dose of 25 
mg/kg/d as the defibrotide Prophylaxis Arm. For patients with a diagnosis of VOD randomized to 
either group, defibrotide was continued until complete resolution of symptoms: 
• 
• 
complete resolution of the ascites and 
reversion of the hepatopedal flow (if present) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012

• 
normalisation of the total and direct bilirubin. (This last parameter was omitted if other causes 
were responsible for additional hepatic injury, i.e. GVHD of the liver) 
For patients diagnosed with VOD that subsequently resolved, defibrotide could be tapered by 
10mg/kg/d for three to four days and stopped thereafter, with the option to return to therapeutic 
doses if signs and symptoms of VOD reoccur. 
Dose selection 
The lower dose of 25 mg/kg/day from the dose-finding study (99-118) was used. 
Selection and timing of dose for each patient 
The daily dose of defibrotide (6.25 mg/kg every 6 hours) was based on the patient’s baseline 
weight, defined as weight on the first day of conditioning. In the defibrotide prophylaxis arm, 
patients received their first dose of defibrotide on the day of conditioning (prior to conditioning). In 
the control arm, patients received their first dose of defibrotide on the day that the patient met 
criteria for VOD by investigator determination. Although dose delays and omissions could occur, 
dose escalation and reductions were not planned. 
After at least 14 days of therapy, defibrotide could be discontinued for patients who were 
discharged from the hospital. If VOD recurred, the patient was readmitted and defibrotide therapy 
reinstituted at the same dose and infusion volume with which he/she was previously treated.  
Defibrotide was held for surgical procedures or to accommodate other urgent medication without 
necessitating dose modification. For surgical procedures, it was recommended that defibrotide 
administration be completed > 2 hours prior to the procedure. Dosing was recommended to be 
scheduled around other medications and interventions, such as dialysis. Defibrotide was not held 
for continuous veno-venous haemofiltration. Interruption of defibrotide prophylactic dosing for 
more than 4 consecutive days was a protocol violation. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate if prophylactic defibrotide has an impact on the incidence of 
VOD by Day+30 from SCT in a paediatric patient population at high risk for VOD. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the benefit of prophylactic defibrotide on a composite scoring system, taking into 
account VOD-associated MOF up to Day+100 after SCT and survival through Day+100 after 
SCT; 
To evaluate if prophylactic defibrotide has an impact on the incidence and severity of 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); 
To evaluate the potential benefit of defibrotide on the incidence of transplant associated 
microangiopathy (TAM; also known as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or TTP); 
To evaluate the effect of defibrotide on the incidence of MOF up to Day+100 and survival 
through Day+100 and Day+180. 
Outcomes/Endpoints

Incidence of VOD by Day+30 post-SCT using modified Seattle criteria which required the presence 
of at least 2 of the following features: 
1) bilirubin > 2 mg/dL,  
2) hepatomegaly (this may be accompanied by right upper quadrant pain) and  
3) ascites and/or unexplained weight gain >5%. 
Sample size 
An initial enrolment of 270 patients into the defibrotide Prophylaxis Arm and Control Arm was 
planned with a specified adaptive interim analysis after 120 patients per arm were completed. The 
sponsor remained blinded to the interim results; results were only available only to an independent 
statistician and DSMB. 
Randomization 
Randomisation was centralized with a randomisation sequence list generated by a computer 
algorithm. Randomisation was 1:1, stratified by centre and the diagnosis of osteopetrosis. 
The Control Arm received no VOD prophylaxis with defibrotide. Patients in either arm who 
developed VOD were allowed to receive treatment with defibrotide at 25mg/kg/day until complete 
resolution of all symptoms (or death). Two interim assessments were performed by an independent 
statistician and overseen by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (the first after 120 
patients total were enrolled, for assessment of patient safety; the second after 120 patients per arm 
were completed for primary outcome, to determine the final sample size). 
Blinding 
Due to defibrotide’s amber colour, a safe and appropriate placebo could not be provided for the 
control arm and the study design was therefore open-label. While investigators were not blinded, 
the independent review committee was blinded in making the determination used in the primary 
endpoint analyses that VOD was present. 
Statistical methods 
ITT was defined as all randomized subjects who consented to participate in the protocol. The 
intent-to-treat analysis set was used as the primary analysis set for the primary and all secondary 
efficacy variables.  
Per protocol: Includes only non-dropouts prior to Day +30 without a serious protocol violation. 
Serious protocol violations were defined in the protocol as those patients who did not proceed to 
myeloablative conditioning or SCT, withdrawal prior to Day+30 post-SCT, violation of the 
defibrotide prophylaxis regimen or daily dose or more than 4 consecutive days without DF 
Prophylactic therapy or other serious protocol violation (such as no high-risk VOD criteria at entry). 
The PP analysis set was the secondary analysis set for all efficacy analyses. 
Adaptive interim efficacy analysis: Performed when 120 patients in each group were completed for 
analysis of the primary outcome to determine the final sample size. The purposes of the adaptive 
interim analysis were to assess the conditional power for achieving a statistically significant result 
on the primary endpoint, in favor of defibrotide, by end of the study with the protocol-specified 
Assessment report

planned final sample size and if such conditional power was less than 30%, to stop the study for 
futility, or to recalculate the final sample size required to achieve conditional power at least 80%. 
Primary efficacy analysis: Based on the one-sided 0.0001 level of significance (interim stage) 
and one-sided 0.02498 level of significance (final stage) comparing the defibrotide Prophylactic 
Group and Control Arm on incidence of VOD. To minimize bias, a blinded Independent Review 
Committee, comprised of experienced clinicians who were nonparticipating investigators in this 
study, was appointed to adjudicate the diagnosis of VOD for those patients with 
investigator-suspected and determined VOD with VOD criteria from SCT through Day+30. The 
adjudication of this committee provided the primary data used in the analysis of the endpoints.  
Treatments were compared on time to VOD, where all randomised patients who did not achieve 
VOD by Day+30 were censored at Day+30 or date of last known follow-up, whichever was earlier. 
Death not due to VOD (deaths in patients without a VOD diagnosis), discontinuing the study due to 
an adverse event, and receipt of a second transplant due to failure of the first transplant were all 
considered competing risks in this analysis. This method is referred to as Available Data Imputation. 
The Z-test was used to calculate P-value. For purposes of sensitivity, the analysis of Available Data 
Imputation was repeated using standard censoring rules by Kaplan Meier analysis (i.e., where 
premature withdrawals, death not due to VOD, discontinuing the study due to an adverse event, 
and receipt of a second transplant due to failure of first transplant were censored), with treatment 
comparisons performed using the log-rank test. 
As additional sensitivity analyses, the defibrotide Prophylaxis Arm comparison was carried out the 
following ways, each with a different method for handling missing data due to patients prematurely 
withdrawn before achieving VOD and before Day+30 (results were compared across the different 
methods to assess consistency of results in the presence of missing data): 1) Worst case 
imputation: All randomized patients who prematurely withdrew before Day+30 were assumed to 
have VOD by Day+30. Following this imputation, the two sample z-test of proportions using the 
normal approximation to the binomial distribution was used to compare treatments on incidence of 
VOD by Day+30. 2) multiple imputation. The logistic regression approach to multiple imputation 
was carried out to impute missing VOD by Day+30 status. The covariates used in the imputation 
model were randomized DF Prophylaxis Arm, age, sex, weight and diagnosis of osteopetrosis. Fifty 
data sets were imputed, and a one-sided test of the significance of the risk difference in VOD 
between treatments carried out on each data set using the above-mentioned logistic regression of 
proportions. In the protocol it was planned to impute five data sets but due to stability reasons in 
the SAP it was decided to impute fifty data sets. SAS PROC MIANALYZE on the results of 50 
significance tests were then used to obtain an assessment of the significance of the overall 
one-sided treatment difference across the five data sets. Each of these methods were used for 
additional treatment comparisons within subgroups (age category, busulfan, 
Mylotarg/gemtuzumab, busulfan with melphalan, infants undergoing IV bulsulfan conditioning and 
allogeneic SCT).

For the type of donor, the numbers were well-matched between the DF Prophylaxis Arm and Control 
Arm. The two arms were relatively well-matched for type of conditioning and immunosuppressant.  
Table 14 provides a summary of baseline criteria that rendered a patient high-risk for VOD and 
thereby eligible for this protocol. Overall, the two groups were well balanced for high-risk criteria. 
The most common high-risk category in each arm was conditioning with busulfan and melphalan, 
followed by pre-existing liver disease, second myeloablative transplantation and allogeneic SCT for 
leukemia.

The defibrotide Prophylaxis Arm had a slightly lower incidence of pre-existing liver disease (24% 
versus 32% in the Control Arm). Overall, the incidence of pre-existing coagulopathy was similar 
between the groups (8% and 7%, respectively), as were systemic viral infections.  
Numbers analysed 
Three populations were defined for this study (ITT, Per Protocol and Safety). The ITT analysis set 
was the primary analysis set for all efficacy analyses. Analysis sets and primary reasons for 
exclusion from the Per Protocol population are summarized in Table 16 below.

GCP inspection findings 
The variability in the diagnosis of VOD in the VOD-DF study (2004-000592-33) was a critical 
concern due to the fact that each site applied its own criteria for diagnosing VOD. The differences in 
methods calculating the 5% weight gain, the availability and timing of the baseline ultrasound, 
processes for performing the ultrasound, interpreting the thickening of the gallbladder wall and flow 
in para-umbilical vein, the precedence of clinical judgment over ultrasound result and the need for 
ultrasound result to confirm VOD diagnosis have all contributed to the inter-site variability.   
The small difference in VOD at day 30 of 8% from this open label trial; the finding that the absolute 
difference falls to 6% when missing data is taken as failure and the concerns about the very 
restricted IRC input raise serious doubt as to the reliability and reproducibility of the results. The 
GCP findings of the critical and major non-compliances included the observation that the two 
centres inspected used different approaches for reaching a diagnosis of VOD.   
In addition, the failure in identifying suspected cases may have led to under reporting cases of VOD 
in the prophylaxis arm because only suspected cases in the control arm, given at least one dose of 
defibrotide were referred.  
The inspection team was of the opinion that the lack of consistency in the processes has contributed 
to the data quality issues identified in the inspection report. The GCP findings are relevant to the 
interpretation of the study results. As the integrity of the data is compromised, the results from the 
prevention study cannot be accepted as providing reliable evidence of efficacy. Only with a second 
blinded prospective trial in adults and children would there be a sufficient level of evidence available 
on which to conclude on the efficacy of defibrotide. 
Discussion on prevention trial results 
Primary efficacy analysis results 
For the final analysis, the primary efficacy variable was VOD by modified Seattle criteria up to 
Day+30 post-SCT (at least two of the following: total bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL, hepatomegaly with or 
without RUQ pain, ascites and/or weight gain >5%) using an overall one-sided 2.5% level of 
significance across the interim and final analysis. The primary analysis compares the ITT population 
of the DF Prophylaxis Arm (180 patients) to the ITT population of the Control Arm (176 patients). 
The hepatic VOD incidence in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm was 12% (22/180), and the hepatic 
VOD incidence in the control arm was 20% (35/176) representing an absolute difference of 8%.

The 2 pre-specified time-to-event analyses provide very similar results, with p-values of 0.0488 
and 0.0507. Although formally one of these analyses failed at the 5% level, the difference between 
them is negligible. The Multiple Imputation (MI) approach yielded broadly similar results, and the 
difference between active (20%) and control (12%) is approximately 8%. 
Due to 5% of the data being missing in the defibrotide arm and 3% being missing in the control arm, 
missing as failure led to a non-significant result, with the point estimate of efficacy being smaller at 
6%. With this imputation for missing as failure it is relevant that the number of subjects that 
accounts for this 6% difference is n=9. Therefore even though the amount of missing data is 
extremely small, the small treatment effect and the small imbalance between arms has led to a key 
sensitivity analysis yielding a non-significant result, with the non-significance being driven by a 
smaller point estimate. It is entirely plausible that this imbalance between arms in missing data is 
due to chance, as the numbers are so small.  
Secondary endpoints 
Several secondary efficacy endpoints were defined for this study. Composite score for hepatic 
VOD-associated multi-organ failure and death (incorporating respiratory failure, renal failure, 
encephalopathy, and survival through Day+100), showed for all patients in the ITT population that 
there was a significant reduction in the composite score for patients randomized to the defibrotide 
prophylaxis arm (p=0.0340).   
The incidence of multi-organ failure through Day +100 showed a significant reduction in the 
incidence of hepatic VOD-associated renal failure in patients receiving defibrotide prophylaxis, 1% 
vs. 6% (p=0.0169) for defibrotide and control arms respectively. Other multiorgan failure incidence 
comparisons did not show treatment differences.  
Composite scores for those patients in either group who were diagnosed with hepatic VOD did not 
show a difference between groups; however this was likely due to the small sample size. 
This study was not powered to demonstrate a reduction of hepatic VOD-associated mortality and for 
ethical reasons (in view of defibrotide usage at the centres) did not incorporate an arm of patients 
who were not treated for hepatic VOD. VOD-associated mortality at Day+100 was lower in the 
defibrotide arm than the control arm (2% and 6%, respectively), but these results were not 
statistically significant. Survival through Day+100 after HSCT and through Day+180 (data not 
shown) did not show a significant difference in survival between the two treatment groups (90% of 
patients in each arm survived to Day+100 post-HSCT; 87% and 86% of the defibrotide Prophylaxis 
and Control patients, respectively, survived to Day+180).  
The mean time to death also was similar between groups (55.4 + 31 days and 49.5 + 29 days for 
the DF Prophylaxis and Control patients, respectively). Overall, patients from both arms with severe 
hepatic VOD had a mortality rate of 32%. Patients with mild to moderate disease had a mortality 
rate of 12%. Below is the table for the secondary outcome of mortality: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 59/135 
 
 
  
  
Mortality analysed by Day +100 was significantly higher in patients with hepatic VOD (24.6%, 
compared to 6% in those without hepatic VOD; p<0.0001). Of 28 patients from both treatment 
arms with hepatic VOD and MOF, 19 (68%) survived to Day +100 and 9 (32%) died.  
Recovery of hepatic VOD in those with MOF is 71% in the control arm versus 64% in the defibrotide 
arm. However in those with hepatic VOD without MOF, the recovery rates were 83% and 100% in 
the control and defibrotide groups respectively.   
With a large number of analyses, the relevance of these small differences, which are not all in favour 
of the defibrotide arm, are not clear. This is particularly important when considering the lack of 
reliability of the data as highlighted by the GCP inspection.   
For a secondary efficacy parameter, the incidence of graft vs. host disease through Days+30, +100 
and +180 was significantly lower in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm on Day+30 and Day+100 
compared to the control arm. In addition, the severity (grade) of graft vs. host disease was 
significantly lower in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm at both these timepoints.

000592-33 
There is weak statistical evidence for the efficacy in the prevention of VOD, with a p-value of 
approximately 0.05 using the absolute number of VOD as diagnosed by the IRC. One reason the 
p-value is large, given the size of the trial, is that the effect size is modest (missing as failure 
analysis yields 23% VOD in control, 17% VOD in defibrotide). Other analyses provide slightly more 
favourable point estimates for the difference of approximately 8%.  
The small differences seen in this open label trial for VOD at Day 30 (12% versus 20% in the active 
and control arms respectively) cannot be confidently ascribed to defibrotide. The finding that the 
absolute difference falls to 6% when missing data is taken as failure and the concerns about the 
very restricted IRC input all raise serious doubt as to the reliability of the results. 
With no effect on mortality and the fact that this was a single adaptive trial which was open-label, 
the results are not considered robust enough to conclude that defibrotide has efficacy in prevention 
of VOD in children at high risk of developing VOD. With a large number of secondary endpoint and 
additional analyses, the relevance of these small differences, which are not all in favour of the DF 
arm, are not clear. This is particularly important when considering the lack of reliability of the data 
as highlighted by the GCP inspection.   
The small difference in VOD at day 30 of 8% from this open label trial; the finding that the absolute 
difference falls to 6% when missing data is taken as failure and the concerns about the very 
restricted IRC input, together with uncertainty as to whether the number of VOD cases in the 
control arm was 35 or 32, all raise serious doubts as to the reliability of the results. This study is not 
considered sufficient to clearly demonstrate a beneficial effect from prophylactic defibrotide. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012

critical and major non GCP-compliance findings identified by the GCP inspection led to the 
conclusion that data from the prevention trial are not reliable. Only with a second blinded 
prospective trial in adults and children would there be a sufficient level of evidence available on 
which to conclude on the efficacy of defibrotide in the prevention of VOD.

Notes 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Although the applicant has provided information on pooled efficacy analysis from the treatment 
trials, this analysis relies heavily on the 32 historical control patients finally chosen for study 
2005-01. A brief overview is presented below but no conclusions can be drawn in view of the 
outstanding major objections relating to the final 32 HC patients.

An Integrated summary of efficacy was presented in the dossier. In this document, efficacy 
summaries are presented for 2 analysis populations: 
• 
ITT5: patients enrolled in Protocol 2005-01, plus those patients enrolled in 
Protocols 99-118 and 2006-05 who would have met eligibility criteria for Protocol 
2005-01. This combined group includes 201 patients with severe VOD enrolled in three 
clinical trials who received a dose of 25 mg/kg/day. 
•  HC: the historical control created for Protocol 2005-01 (n=32). 
A patient enrolled in Protocol 99-118 or 2006-05 was considered to be eligible for Protocol 2005-01 
if the patient had a Baltimore diagnosis of VOD by Day+21 post-SCT with renal and/or pulmonary 
dysfunction as defined by Protocol 2005-01, together with a diagnosis of MOF up to and including 
Day +28 post-SCT. The ITT5 group was analyzed and compared to the Historical Control. 
•  Comparison of ITT5 did not show any statistically significant differences between any of the 
baseline demographics. 
•  Comparison of ITT5 to the HC did not show any major difference in renal or pulmonary 
dysfunction at study entry. 
Table 21 
CR in the treatment population was 30% as compared to 9% in the historical control group, a 
statistically significant finding for the propensity-adjusted analysis (p-value = 0.0015).  
Also survival by Day+100 (40.2% vs 25.0%) was significantly better in the treatment arm 
(p=0.0294). 
It remains unclear whether patients included retrospectively from the 99-118 and 2006-05 studies 
were subjected to the same rigorous selection process as for the final HC or how a biased selection 
was actually and practically avoided.

Currently, the pooled analysis is associated with the major uncertainties relating to the selection of 
the original and final HC cohorts and is not considered supportive. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The prevention trial was performed in children at high risk of VOD. The treatment trial was 
performed in adults and children with severe VOD. 
Supportive study(ies) 
DF-VOD Trial was a multicentre, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial to determine the 
safety and efficacy of defibrotide iv (40 mg/kg/day) for the treatment of hepatic VOD in 
hematopoietic SCT patients. Although 340 patients were planned only 68 were analysed due to slow 
recruitment and the study was terminated. 
Efficacy 
Only primary endpoints were analysed in the interim analysis. Eleven patients (32.4%) of the 
defibrotide group and 15 patients (44.1%) of the Control group were considered to have had a 
Complete Remission (Complete Response) by Day +100. The difference between the two groups 
was not statistically significant (at a p-value of 0.456 by Log-Rank test). Twenty-one patients 
(61.8%) of the defibrotide group and 20 patients (58.8%) of the control died by Day+100. The 
difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (at a p-value of 0.829 by Log- 
Rank test). 
The interim analysis data from defibrotide-VOD show a higher CR in the control arm. Although this 
was only an interim analysis and the number were limited (68) it needs to be considered that each 
arm in the DF-VOD was similar in size to the HC group. 
The results from this study DF-VOD Trial (September 2001 – October 2005) are not supportive of 
efficacy and the widespread off-label use of DF led to slow recruitment and early termination. 
Although limited in size and open label, the DF-VOD trial has the advantage over the pivotal 
treatment trial in that a concurrent control group (n=34), which was numerically larger than the 
final HC group (n=32) in the pivotal treatment trial has been used. The results from this study 
further highlight the lack of a clear demonstration of efficacy in the treatment of VOD. 
Such additional information from the DF-VOD-Trial needs to be taken into account when viewing the 
entire data-set provided in support of efficacy. Although it is also noted that there were baseline 
imbalances in this trial favouring the control arm in the DF-VOD trial it could be argued that the data 
from DF-VOD-Trial, being the only study with a concurrent control group, are relevant.  
Supportive studies from the literature were also provided by the applicant for treatment and 
prevention indications. 
Compassionate Use Program Experience: Treatment of Hepatic VOD 
In 1998, the applicant established a prospective, open-label, non-comparative compassionate-use 
program to monitor the safety and effectiveness of defibrotide for the treatment of hepatic VOD 
(Study DF-CUP). To receive compassionate supply, treating physicians were asked to complete an 
‘Eligibility form’ which included patient initials, age, gender, weight, transplant details, hepatic VOD 
criteria, exclusion criteria and documentation of informed consent. Physicians were also requested 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 68/135 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements specific to their Member State, and to 
obtain any necessary authorisations (Ethical Committee) for the compassionate use of a 
defibrotide, an unapproved drug for the treatment of hepatic VOD. After review of the eligibility 
form, the applicant’s Medical Department shipped the defibrotide to the site address provided by 
treating physicians. 
In response to requests from treating physicians from 311 sites worldwide, defibrotide intravenous 
solution was supplied for 1,129 patients for the treatment of hepatic VOD post HSCT or following 
chemotherapy from December 1998 until March 2009. Physicians from 230 sites provided voluntary 
safety and outcome information via standardised forms for 711 patients who had received at least 
one dose of drug. Patients eligible to receive defibrotide treatment included those who had a clinical 
diagnosis of hepatic VOD by Seattle criteria or those who developed hepatic VOD post 
chemotherapy (without HSCT). Patients who did not meet the Seattle criteria but whom had other 
criteria (ultrasound or histological criteria) were also eligible to receive drug. Severe hepatic VOD 
was classified when the criteria for hepatic VOD were met and MOF in at least one of the following 
organ systems was documented: renal (and or dialysis-dependence), respiratory and/or central 
nervous system; ventilator dependence was also documented. 
The 711 patients with safety outcome data and the 1,129 patients who were originally requested for 
defibrotide are similar for demographic data, baseline and primary diseases characteristics. 
Conditioning regimens were found to be similarly represented between Europe, Asia and America, 
with the most frequently received regimens including cyclophosphamide, busulfan and total body 
irradiation Of the 711 patients documented to have hepatic VOD, 676 (95%) had at least two 
hepatic VOD criteria (elevated bilirubin >2mg/dL, hepatomegaly, ascites, or weight gain >5%) and 
were included in the ITT (treated) hepatic VOD Population. Severe hepatic VOD was documented for 
42% (285/676) of these patients. The summary of complete response is presented in Table 22.

The CR and survival data are variable and better in those with VOD associated with chemotherapy 
without HSCT. For those with severe hepatic VOD survival was lower and at ~40% at day 100, 
similar to the results from 2005-01. However the efficacy collection was voluntary and not 
standardised. Only a subset of patients who received defibrotide in the DF-CUP had efficacy data 
provided. The results therefore can only be considered as supportive for safety.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
For the main trial provided in support of the treatment indication (Study 2005-01) there are major 
problems with the conduct of this multicentre open label historically controlled trial. The historical 
control group were reduced from 86 to 32 subjects following an interim analysis. The baseline 
characteristics of the original 86 HC subjects were similar to the treatment group. However 54 cases 
were identified as not being eligible due to exclusion criteria over a period of days following 
inclusion. The removal of these subjects altered the results markedly. The conduct of this trial and 
the requirement to re-review the notes of the originally agreed HC group over a period of time such 
that an “unequivocal” diagnosis of severe VOD could be assigned raises the major concerns that this 
stringency was not applied to the treatment group. 
The GCP inspection raised a major issue on the process for and documentation of selection of the HC 
group. These GCP findings further question the reliability of the small final HC chosen, as no efficacy 
was seen when the TG and 86 HC group were compared. 
In conclusion, the results from the treatment study 2005-01 are not considered to provide adequate 
evidence for efficacy of DF in the treatment indication. 
The main trial in support of the prevention of VOD (Study 2004-000592-33) was in children only 
and was an open label multi-centre study with one group receiving defibrotide prophylaxis and the 
other as a control. This is termed the prophylaxis phase. On development of VOD subjects in either 
arm received defibrotide at the same dose as for the prophylaxis and entered the treatment phase. 
The lack of blinding is a serious limitation for a single pivotal multi-centre trial where the endpoint 
(VOD) is not as clearly objective as a single centralised laboratory parameter or mortality would be. 
The contribution of the independent review panel (IRC) was limited to review of cases only in whom 
a diagnosis of VOD was made by the investigator. This restriction weakens the IRC contribution to 
the study. Further to the triggered GCP inspection further problems have been highlighted with the 
design and conduct of the prevention study. It is of note that in 3/35 cases in the control arm that 
were diagnosed as having VOD by the IRC, these 3 subjects subsequently had their diagnosis 
rejected by the principal investigator. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Treatment indication 
For study 2005-01 for the treatment of VOD, the primary endpoint was complete response by Day 
100 and The Imputed Analysis was the primary method for analysis. For the imputed complete 
response rates there was a difference when the treatment group was compared to the 32 HC group 
(23.5% versus 9.4%) whereas no significant difference was seen when the treatment group was 
compared with the original HC group of 86 (23.5% versus 19.8%).  
The results from study 2005-01 cannot be regarded as providing evidence of efficacy as the 32 HC 
group is not considered an acceptable control. The results from study 2006-5 were similar to those 
from 2005-01 in terms of CR, and the comparison to the finally chosen HC group is considered to be 
problematic as for study 2005-01. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 71/135 
 
 
  
  
Study DF-VOD was a standard of care-controlled trial for the treatment of VOD. This study was 
terminated and data for only 34 patients in each arm was available. There was no statistical 
difference between the two arms in CR or Day 100 survival.  CR was 32.4% in the defibrotide arm 
versus 44.1% in the control arm. Death at day 100 was 61.8% in the defibrotide arm compared with 
58.8% of the control arm. This trial cannot be considered as supportive for the treatment indication. 
Prevention indication 
For the final analysis of the prevention trial (2004-000592-33), the primary efficacy variable was 
VOD by modified Seattle criteria up to Day+30 post-SCT using an overall one-sided 2.5% level of 
significance across the interim and final analysis. The primary analysis compares the ITT population 
of the defibrotide Prophylaxis Arm (180 patients) to the ITT population of the Control Arm (176 
patients). 
The Multiple Imputation (MI) approach yielded broadly similar results, and the difference between 
active (20%) and control (12%) is approximately 8% (weakly statistically significant). 
Due to 5% of the data being missing in the defibrotide arm and 3% being missing in the control arm, 
missing as failure led to a non-significant result, with the point estimate of efficacy being smaller at 
6%. Therefore even though the amount of missing data is extremely small, the small treatment 
effect and the small imbalance between arms has led to a key sensitivity analysis yielding a 
non-significant result, with the non-significance being driven by a smaller point estimate. It is 
entirely plausible that this imbalance between arms in missing data is due to chance, as the 
numbers are so small.  
From a clinical perspective the small difference in VOD at day 30 of 8% from this open label trial is 
not considered sufficient to clearly demonstrate a beneficial effect from defibrotide in view of the 
problems associated with the trial design and conduct.   
The small difference in VOD at day 30 of 8% from this open label trial; the finding that the absolute 
difference falls to 6% when missing data is taken as failure and the concerns about IRC input all 
raise serious doubt as to the reliability and reproducibility of the results. This study is not considered 
sufficient to clearly demonstrate a beneficial effect from prophylactic defibrotide. The GCP findings 
raise serious doubt about the integrity of the data.  
Only with a second blinded prospective trial in adults and children would there be a sufficient level 
of evidence available on which to conclude on a beneficial effect from defibrotide. 
Additional expert consultation 
An ad hoc expert group meeting was held on 12.09.2012 to provide advice to the CHMP on specific 
questions. 
The expert panel made the following recommendations: 
•  The experts agreed that the mechanism of action (MoA) is not yet understood from the 
data submitted by the applicant. The expert panel agreed that limitations in defining 
defibrotide from a quality perspective, could lead to significant problems in confirming the 
quality of the product in the management of the lifecycle for this biologically sourced and 
polydisperse product. It was also mentioned that since the pharmacological rationale for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 72/135 
 
  
  
the use of DF has not been established, no extrapolation of clinical data can be made 
based on “pharmacological plausibility”.   
•  The experts were of the view that the HC group could not be accepted as a good and 
reliable control group in the clinical trial setting. The HC group was altered during the 
clinical trial. Although there were 86 patients initially included in the clinical trial, the HC 
group was reduced to 32 cases during an interim analysis. A total of 54 patients in the 
historical control group were removed although 51 out of these 54 patients met the 
inclusion criteria. The experts’ view is that the removal of these subjects could have 
altered the study results in favour of DF. In addition the experts noted that the data on 
complete response rates in each arm showed no difference when the original 86 HC group 
were compared with the treatment group. 
• 
For the VOD prevention indication the experts noted that the applicant performed a single 
open label multicentre trial in children at high risk of developing VOD. The study was 
planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of defibrotide (intravenously at 25 mg/kg/day) 
versus no prophylactic treatment on the incidence and outcome of VOD. The experts 
agreed that the results are not sufficiently robust to conclude that defibrotide can be used 
for prophylaxis of VOD. 
• 
From the safety point of view, the expert group noted that the death rate was higher in the 
prevention study when children who did not develop VOD and received DF were compared 
with subjects in the control arm who did not develop VOD. This fact still remains 
unexplained and in their views could be associated with defibrotide exposure. This 
according to the experts is particularly important considering that the proposed indication 
by the applicant includes both children and those with renal impairment who would have 
higher exposure to defibrotide. it was agreed that the lack of clear safety data results from 
the lack of a placebo controlled group available for comparison to those with or without 
VOD. 
• 
The expert group agreed that whereas for the treatment indication there is a lack of an 
effective alternative therapy for patients suffering from severe hepatic VOD, for the 
prophylactic indication, management may include general supportive therapy and 
treatment or prophylaxis of, for instance, infection or metabolic derangements. They are 
of the opinion that current data do not support the prevention indication for defibrotide. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy has not been clearly demonstrated for the treatment of VOD due to concerns about the 
conduct of the treatment study 2005-01, particularly the adjustment of the HC group, such that 32 
cases with very poor outcome were ultimately chosen. The GCP inspection raised a major issue on 
the process for and documentation of selection of the HC group.  These GCP findings further 
question the utility of the small final HC chosen, as no efficacy was seen when the TG and 86 HC 
group were compared. In conclusion, the results from the treatment study 2005-01 are not 
considered to provide adequate evidence for efficacy of DF in the treatment indication. 
The prevention indication trial has methodological weaknesses and with a point estimate of 8%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 73/135 
 
  
  
reduced to 6% for a worse case analysis is not considered robust evidence for efficacy from an 
open label study. No difference in mortality was seen between the 2 arms although the trial was 
not powered to demonstrate such an effect. Therefore the data to support efficacy for the 
prophylactic indication from a single pivotal open label trial is not considered robust.    
The critical and major non GCP-compliance findings identified by the GCP inspection lead to the 
conclusion that the data for the prevention trial are not reliable. Therefore although the data and 
multiple analyses provided by the applicant have been presented and discussed above, based on 
the data integrity issues highlighted by the GCP inspection the validity of the results are in serious 
doubt. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The four principal studies in severe VOD treatment and VOD prophylaxis included a total of 647 
HSCT subjects who received at least one dose of defibrotide. In addition, 52 healthy volunteers 
were dosed with defibrotide in the R09-1425 cardiac safety study. Nearly all subjects in the 
treatment and prophylaxis studies received a daily dose of 25 mg/kg/day (in 4 divided doses) with 
the exception of 75 subjects in 99-118 who received 40 mg/kg/day. The duration of treatment in 
the post-HSCT trials was dependent upon the patient’s condition and ranged from a mean of 21.6 
days in 2006-05 to a mean of 28.7 days in patients who were switched from prophylaxis to 
treatment in EudraCT 2004-000592-33. Subjects in R09- 1425 received single exposures from each 
of two defibrotide doses: 6.25 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg.

Table 24 
Study Subject Drug Exposure by Mean Daily Dose and Duration of 
Exposure: severe VOD treatment and VOD prevention studies  
Adverse events 
The demographic profiles of subjects in defibrotide’s VOD treatment protocols 99-118, 2005-01 and 
2005-06 were similar in most demographic variables. The major difference between the various 
studies was that EudraCT 2004-000592-33 was conducted in a paediatric population exclusively, 
whereas the severe VOD treatment studies spanned an age range from infants to the elderly. 
Accordingly, the patients in EudraCT 2004-000592-33 were younger, weighed less and were 
shorter than the patients in the other three studies. All patient populations were predominantly 
white (69%-81%). The principal studies in support of defibrotide are 99-118, 2005-01, and 
2006-05 for treatment of severe VOD, and EudraCT:2004-000592-33 for prevention of VOD in 
paediatric patients. All were multiple-dose studies in very ill patients following stem cell 
transplantation. The cardiac safety trial R09-1425 was limited exposure (two single dose 
administrations) in healthy volunteers, and is not included in this adverse event analysis across 
studies. 
In each of the four VOD studies, subjects were undergoing stem cell transplantation for significant 
underlying disease (e.g., cancer in most cases). The paediatric prevention study 
EudraCT:2004-000592-33 was designed to provide randomized efficacy and safety data in 
comparison to a “best care” cohort which did not receive prophylactic defibrotide. Study 2005- 01, 
which was historically controlled for ethical and practical considerations, provided a controlled 
evaluation of defibrotide safety in a patient population generally sicker, on the basis of severe VOD 
with organ system involvement beyond the liver as an inclusion criterion, than in the paediatric 
prevention study. Study 99-118 provided a randomized evaluation of safety at two different 
defibrotide doses to potentially detect dose-limiting toxicities. Study 2006-05 was not controlled, 
but the key inclusion and exclusion criteria matched those of study 2005-01 such that the latter 
study’s historical control group can provide context for the observed safety findings in 2006-05. 
There was high risk of clinically important adverse events in the populations studied in these 
defibrotide trials based on the clinical condition of subjects at entry. Based on the known clinical 
courses of patients undergoing stem cell transplantation, it was anticipated there would be 
substantial risk of serious adverse events including fatality during the time period of evaluation in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 75/135 
 
 
 
 
  
  
these trials (follow-up to as long as 100-180 days after transplantation). We believe these risks 
were not likely equivalent between the four studies on the basis of some differences in 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and in some key demographic variables relative to the potential impact 
of such differences on efficacy endpoints. In particular, factors such as extent of dialysis or 
ventilator dependence at entry, which were not equivalent for these studies, would be expected to 
meaningfully affect a patient’s clinical course and safety assessment following HSCT. For a relative 
assessment of safety across the studies, we rank the patients entered in the 2005-01 treatment 
arm as the sickest in terms of underlying multi-system dysfunctions at entry. At the other end of the 
risk spectrum, the EudraCT:2004-000592-33 paediatric prevention trial clearly represented a 
healthier patient population than those of the severe VOD trials since VOD had not developed at 
study entry, and high-risk conditions at initiation of prophylaxis such as renal failure and use of 
assisted ventilation were very unusual. 
Adverse events were very common across these studies. Nearly all subjects experienced at least 
one adverse event, and the majority also experienced at least one serious or severe (grade 3-5) 
event. Haemorrhage was noted in half of more of subjects in each study. Adverse events leading to 
discontinuation from the studies was more variable, as were events associated with death. In 
general, the relative adverse events profiles across studies appear to correlate with the variable 
clinical status of subjects in these studies at entry, prior to receiving defibrotide. The subjects at 
greatest risk for clinical complications in the post-HSCT period due to their poor medical status, 
those in study 2005-01 as discussed above, demonstrated the worst overall adverse events profile. 
Subjects in EudraCT:2004-000592-33, who did not have VOD or advanced multi-organ failure at 
study entry, demonstrated the least severe adverse events profile. 
Investigators in each of these studies were very experienced with stem cell transplantation and its 
complications, and the majority of recorded adverse events were considered related to clinical 
factors other than administration of defibrotide. Defibrotide-related adverse events were greatest 
in study 2005-01 (occurring in 45% of subjects) and study 2006-05 (22% of subjects), and very 
infrequent in the dose-ranging 99-118 and EudraCT:2004-000592-33 prophylaxis trials (4-9%). 
The three severe VOD trials, which primarily involved the major U.S. transplant centres, had 
extensive overlap in the participating investigators, and relatedness classification decisions would 
be expected to be relatively consistent across these studies. However, there were protocol specified 
differences in causality assessment which clearly would influence related/unrelated determinations 
despite the investigator continuity. In study 99-118 related events were fairly stringently defined as 
probably or definitely related to defibrotide, and therefore their contribution to all adverse events is 
logically lower than in studies 2005-01 and 2006-05 which each also included possibly-related 
within this category. Related events in EudraCT 2004- 000592-33 were defined as possibly, 
probably or definitely related to defibrotide, and their relative paucity compared to studies 2005-01 
and 2006-05 is not clear. This may be a function of the participating investigators, who in 
comparison to most US investigators had extensive prior experience with defibrotide, or it may 
reflect different philosophies for relatedness determinations. It is also conceivable that the nature of 
events occurring during prophylaxis in EudraCT 2004-000592-33 were more readily attributable to 
the HSCT experience itself. The explanations for the variable reporting and causality association 
given by the applicant above are acknowledged. This variability in reporting and of assigning levels 
of causality which differ by trial and by investigator further complicates identification of DF-related 
toxicity.

Page 76/135 
 
  
  
In studies 2005-01, 2006-05 and EudraCT 2004-000592-33, events considered by investigators to 
be related to defibrotide administration were mostly haemorrhagic in nature (especially epistaxis, 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, pulmonary haemorrhage, cerebral haemorrhage, or catheter site 
haemorrhage) or episodes of hypotension.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
The patient population in the three severe VOD treatment studies were subjects undergoing stem 
cell transplantation for significant underlying disease (e.g., cancer in most cases) with VOD and 
multiple organ dysfunctions. Based on an extensive clinical experience in these patient populations, 
the subjects in all studies were very sick at entry and had substantial risks to develop serious 
complications during the course of the study due to the transplantation procedure. Accordingly, the 
risk of death was high in these patients independent of any potential complication from addition of 
defibrotide to a complicated therapeutic milieu. In the paediatric VOD prevention study, subjects 
did not have VOD with organ failure at study entry, and their risk of death would be anticipated to 
be much lower. 
The frequencies of patients receiving defibrotide in the three severe VOD treatment studies with 
adverse events leading to death were substantial. Events associated with fatal outcomes in these 
studies were 65% in the 2005-01 study, 47% in 2006-05, and 16-19% in the two treatment arms 
of 99-118. As discussed in the overall analysis of adverse events, the relative severity of a patient’s 
clinical status when entered into these studies was not equivalent between the studies. In general, 
the relative distributions of events associated with fatal outcomes parallels the overall clinical status 
at entry in these severe VOD treatment trials. The incidence of events leading to death in the 
paediatric prophylactic study EudraCT:2004-000592-33 was relatively low (16-18% in the two 
arms); however, due to the large size of the trial this represented a substantial number of fatalities. 
Adverse events associated with fatal outcomes were varied, and distributed across many of the 
body systems.  
The most common events associated with fatalities (arbitrarily chosen at >2% for convenience of 
discussion) were generally attributable to the clinical condition under investigation of stem cell 
transplantation for cancer, with the further complications of VOD and multi-organ system 
dysfunction in the severe VOD treatment trials. Accordingly, most events associated with fatalities 
were in the hepatobiliary, renal, respiratory, and neoplastic disorders systems. 
The general categories of events that are reproducibly distributed across these studies are related 
to underling cancers, VOD, organ dysfunctions, infectious complications, and graft vs. host disease. 
In the 2005-01 and EudraCT:2004-000592-33 trials for which control groups were evaluated, 
fatalities were overall equivalent between treatment and control groups and there are no apparent 
associations between specific events and use of defibrotide. In the uncontrolled studies, similarities 
in the general distribution of fatalities to events associated with death from both treatment and 
no-treatment arms in the controlled studies further suggest that events associated with fatal 
outcomes are inherent to the study populations. 
In study 99-118, none of the events associated with fatal outcomes were related to defibrotide 
according to the investigators. In 2005-01, all drug-related deaths in the treatment group (10) had 
some component of haemorrhage (pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or involving the central nervous

system) involved in the death. However, a similar distribution of haemorrhagic events was 
associated with death in the historical control group, suggesting that these related events  may 
have been components of the underlying clinical state. In 2006-05, defibrotide-related events 
associated with death in 3 subjects similarly had either a component of haemorrhage 
(gastrointestinal, involving the central nervous system, mouth or epistaxis) or hypotension. In the 
paediatric study EudraCT 2004-000592-33, investigators considered only one case involving 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage to be potentially related to defibrotide. Within the high background 
risk of fatal outcomes in both treatment and control arms of these studies, no signal is apparent to 
suggest a contribution from defibrotide-related toxicity. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Non-fatal serious adverse events were presented by the applicant (note that serious adverse events 
could not be evaluated from the historical control group of study 2005-01). Serious adverse events 
were reported from all the major body systems. From EudraCT:2004-000592-33 the distribution of 
serious adverse events was similar between the active defibrotide arm and the untreated control 
arm. From 99-118, serious adverse events are similarly distributed between the high-dose 40 
mg/kg/day arm and the low-dose 25 mg/kg/day arm. The adverse events that are reproducibly 
distributed across these studies are consistent with the patients’ underling cancers, VOD, renal, 
pulmonary or central nervous system dysfunctions, infectious complications, graft vs. host disease, 
and high frequencies of fatal outcome. No adverse events have been identified that are suggestive 
of defibrotide toxicity. 
Laboratory findings 
Standard laboratory evaluations, including determinations at baseline, during and/or at the end of 
defibrotide dosing, and during long-term follow-up, were conducted in studies 99-118, 2005-001, 
and EudraCT: 2004-000592-33. Treatment IND study 2006-05 did not collect laboratory results. 
As expected for very ill patients in the post-stem cell transplant period, laboratory results were 
highly variable. This variability reflected very heterogeneous clinical courses as well as frequent 
support with blood products and coagulation factors, large fluid shifts over time, and development 
and resolution of concomitant disease processes such as coagulopathy, bleeding, infection, and 
metabolic complications. Renal function abnormalities, and elevated bilirubin and other liver 
analytes, were found by definition in all subjects who met entry criteria of VOD with multi-organ 
failure. Analytes such as total bilirubin, fibrinogen concentrations, and renal function tests often 
improved with response to defibrotide and worsened in subjects with progressive VOD. Otherwise, 
it is difficult to identify laboratory trends that reflect more than the effects of subject variability in 
clinical course. 
In controlled studies 2005-001 and EudraCT: 2004-000592-33, there were no obvious differences 
in laboratory parameters between cohorts with active defibrotide treatment and untreated control  
groups. In dose-ranging study 99-118, there were no apparent differences between low-dose and  
high-dose defibrotide therapy. There also were no obvious differences in laboratory abnormalities 
that were identified as adverse events. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
Assessment report

Study EudraCT:2004-000592-33 was conducted in paediatric patients in the age range from infants 
(28 days) to 18 years. Defibrotide was well tolerated in this VOD prevention study, with no apparent 
differences in safety profile to the control group (randomized to no defibrotide prophylaxis). Few 
elderly were studied in the other defibrotide trials because stem cell transplantation is uncommon 
in this age subgroup. However, occasional subjects in the age group > 65 years in 2005-01 (1 
subject) and 2006-05 (1 subject) did not appear to have a different safety profile from younger 
subjects. Our intrinsic facts such as gender, height, weight, body mass and composition, other 
illness, and organ dysfunction did not appear to impact defibrotide tolerability. 
Extrinsic Factors 
There is no available information related to interactions of defibrotide with alcohol, tobacco, food 
habits or other extrinsic factors. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Defibrotide has not been studied in pregnant or lactating females. 
Overdose 
There have been no overdoses in clinical trials of defibrotide. 
Drug Abuse 
No information is available about potential for drug abuse. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No information is available about potential with withdrawal effects or rebound. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
No information is available about potential for impairment of mentation or coordination. 
Immunological events 
No antibody assays were developed for detection of an immune response to defibrotide. No reports 
of anaphylactic reactions were reported in the clinical trials.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is no available information related to interactions of defibrotide with other drugs. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Events Leading to Discontinuation 
Defibrotide was generally well tolerated in the clinical trials, although adverse events leading to 
discontinuation in these studies were relatively common. Six subjects in 99-118 discontinued due to 
adverse events; however, only 3 were considered related to defibrotide. Thirty-six subjects in the 
active treatment arm of 2005-01 discontinued due to adverse events; in 22 cases the events 
leading to discontinuation were considered related to defibrotide. In 2006- 05, 69 subjects in 
discontinued due to adverse events; in 26 cases the events were considered  related to defibrotide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 79/135 
 
 
 
  
  
In EudraCT: 2004-000592-33, 17 subjects in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm discontinued for 
adverse events, and 21 subjects in the control arm. 
The common adverse events associated with discontinuation from the studies were varied, and 
often related to organ dysfunction, underlying neoplastic processes, or bleeding complications. 
In general, the adverse events that led to discontinuation were severe toxicities that are frequently 
part of the post-HSCT course (infection, recurrent malignancy, transplant rejection, etc.). Such 
events are unlikely to be considered potentially related to study drug. Those events leading to 
discontinuation that were considered by investigators to be related to defibrotide treatment were 
relatively few, and consist predominantly of haemorrhagic events and hypotension. Given the 
likelihood that haemorrhagic events and hypotension are part of underlying disease processes in 
these patients, supported by the generally similar component of such events in the control groups 
when all events leading to discontinuation are viewed, these events do not appear to represent a 
signal of defibrotide intolerability or limiting toxicity. 
Post marketing experience 
Twelve PSURs were received from the time defibrotide was available both as an oral and IV 
formulation on the Italian market from 1995 to 2008. Three reports were spontaneous and 9 were 
received from the Italian authorities.  
Although defibrotide has been used for over 20 years, it is clear from the literature reports that 
defibrotide was not from the same animal and tissue source as the defibrotide that in the current 
applicant. As such the data from PSURs (which include oral usage) cannot be considered as 
supportive evidence for safety. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Although the size of the total safety database in total is considered to be reasonable for the 
proposed indications, the safety evaluation is hampered by the following: 
1) In the historical control group it was not possible to retrospectively classify SAEs and AEs 
separately. This hampers the utility of the safety data from the HC group to act as a control. 
2) Signs and symptoms related to SCT or pre-existing conditions/VOD/MOF were generally not 
reported, unless worsened, representing an SAE or presentation at a higher seriousness or 
intensity than expected. But in the absence of a control group possible relatedness to defibrotide 
cannot be established. 
3) Decisions regarding the relation of a sign or symptom specifically to a study drug in such a 
complicated clinical situation as the setting of post SCT, especially when VOD/MOF is present, 
must be considered to be associated with a degree of uncertainty. 
In the total safety database for VOD treatment (n=1986), MedDRA PTs reported as related to 
defibrotide in ≥1% of patients are gastrointestinal haemorrhage (2.17%), hypotension (1.56%), 
coagulopathy (1.16%), epistaxis (1.01%), and pulmonary haemorrhage (1.46%); none is 
reported in ≥1% of patients receiving defibrotide for prophylaxis (n=772). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 80/135 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
In clinical studies, 568 patients (88%) who received any dose of defibrotide experienced AEs, with 
the most frequent being Hypotension (20%), Diarrhoea (13%), and Vomiting (10%), 
Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Nausea and Pyrexia (8%), Epistaxis (7%), Pulmonary 
haemorrhage, Pleural effusion, Exfoliative rash, Hypertension, Haemorrhage (site not specified), 
Abdominal pain (5%). The most frequent defibrotide-related adverse events were Haemorrhages 
(104/135 patients 77%); Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Pulmonary haemorrhage and epistaxis. 
Fatal AEs that were considered defibrotide-related by the investigator were reported in 7 patients 
in the treatment population and 1 patient in the prevention population. All of these included a 
component of bleeding and occurred at the 25 mg/kg/day level. This number does not include the 
18 deaths predominantly due to haemorrhage in DF-CUP.  
For reasons given above, as well as the lack of a PD marker and uncertainties regarding the MoA, 
interpretation of laboratory findings potentially related to defibrotide is difficult and laboratory 
abnormalities potentially related to defibrotide therefore may remain to be detected. 
There are no major safety signals that can be clearly attributed to defibrotide although an 
increased risk for bleeding which is higher in higher dose groups has been noted and the concern 
about an increased mortality in children receiving high dose defibrotide have been raised. The lack 
of clear safety data is in part a result of the lack of a placebo controlled group available for 
comparison in those with VOD. 
Data from study DF-VOD which included a concurrent control VOD group was limited to 34 
subjects in the DF and control arm. Major bleeding events were present for 9 patients (26.5%) in 
the Control group and 11 (32.4%) in the defibrotide group, but SAEs considered as possibly 
related to treatment were similar in both arms. Haemorrhage is being identified as a risk by the 
applicant. 
The safety of defibrotide is provided for healthy volunteers, for those at risk of developing VOD and 
for those with VOD. As those undergoing HSCT and those with VOD have serious concurrent 
morbidity, it is difficult to distinguish between disease-associated and treatment related AEs.  This 
is problematic also because of the protracted duration of infusion and treatment (4 daily IV 
infusions each of 2 hours for a total duration of at least 14 days). Another complication in 
assessing the safety relates to the unclear MoA for defibrotide and the absence of an identified PD 
effect.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The assessment of paediatric safety showed an excess of mortality in the high dose arm (group B) 
in the dose-finding study 99-118 for those under 18 year. This issue raises questions about the 
safety of defibrotide in children.   
For assessing the safety of DF in those without VOD, a comparison of safety in the prevention 
study comparing the defibrotide arm with the control arm for only those subjects who never 
developed VOD was provided by the applicant. The safety profile was less favourable in the 
defibrotide arm and a higher death rate of 25 (17%) in the defibrotide arm compared with 18 
(13%) in the control arm was noted. With the exception of one case of haemorrhage for which

some contribution of defibrotide cannot be excluded it is not possible to ascribe these deaths to DF 
with any degree of certainty. While the absolute number of excess deaths was small (n=7), there 
remains doubt as to whether defibrotide contributed to the excess deaths in the prophylaxis arm. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The CHMP noted that the data are hampered by the absence of sufficient concurrent controlled 
safety data, however no major safety signals that can be definitely attributed to defibrotide were 
observed. A dose-response in toxicity (increased bleeding at higher doses in DF-CUP and increased 
mortality in children on high dose in the dose finding study) cannot be excluded from the data 
provided.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD) is a serious pathology resulting from endothelial damage 
most commonly seen in the setting of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The 
predisposing factors include agents causing endothelial injury such as chemotherapy for SCT 
conditioning and total body irradiation. The precise pathogenesis of VOD is not fully elucidated but 
damage to the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium followed by thrombosis in the sinusoids leads to 
hepatic dysfunction, fluid retention and, if severe, can be associated with renal impairment and 
multi-organ failure. The diagnosis of VOD is very difficult as it requires exclusion of other 
pathologies seen often in the Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) setting such as infection 
and Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD). In addition the diagnosis may take a few days to make and 
is dependent upon the criteria used. The Baltimore criteria are more stringent than the Seattle 
criteria. In addition the more recently modified Seattle criteria allow for the diagnosis of VOD up to 
day 30 post-transplant.   
Another difficulty in the management of cases with VOD is when to give potentially toxic therapies 
(e.g. recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) in an attempt to stop the microthrombosis in the 
liver. For aiding clinical decisions in these cases the Bearman model has been employed. This model 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 82/135 
 
 
  
  
takes into account the timing, degree and rate of rise in body weight and serum bilirubin levels. This 
prospectively validated prediction model applies to patients treated with cyclophosphamide and 
may not be applicable to patients treated with less toxic conditioning regimens. Using this model 
has been shown to have a high specificity, but only moderate sensitivity, for predicting those who 
will go on to develop severe VOD, which is defined as VOD with multi-organ failure. 
Currently the literature reports on both the incidence of and prognosis for VOD support the fact that 
for severe VOD the prognosis is poor with a high mortality rate. With less toxic conditioning 
regimens, lower doses of TBI and overall better HLA matching available over the last decade, it is 
possible that the incidence of VOD may be declining but on the other hand the increasing use of SCT 
in more patients and in older patients may offset this. Currently there is no licensed therapy for this 
indication and the availability of an effective treatment for this patient group would be of great 
benefit. 
This application is for both the treatment of VOD and the prevention of VOD. Both proposed 
indications were supported by open label clinical trials. 
For the treatment indication trial (2005-01) a historical control (HC) group was used, and patients 
in both arms were defined as having severe VOD. The multiple amendments during the on-going 
open label study to the HC group led to a change from the originally chosen 86 HC subjects to a 
finally chosen 32 cases. When the primary endpoint of complete response was compared between 
the treatment group receiving DF (TG) and the original HC group no differences were seen. When 
the comparison was made between the TG group and the final HC group of 32 cases the results were 
significant with 23% versus 9% in complete response (CR) at Day 100.  
For the prevention indication paediatric patients at high risk of developing VOD were assigned to an 
active prophylaxis arm and a placebo arm in Study 2004-000532. Once subjects in either the 
control or prophylaxis arm developed VOD they received treatment with defibrotide. The results 
showed a very small benefit for the active group in terms of the primary endpoint: development of 
VOD at day 30; with an 8% difference in the incidence of VOD between the 2 arms with borderline 
statistical significance. This difference between the arms was reduced to a non-statistically 
significant difference of 6% when missing data was treated as failure.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The underlying MoA of defibrotide was claimed initially by the applicant as having multiple 
endothelial protective properties. Much of the older literature cites this as the MoA for defibrotide. 
The applicant has provided information on an endothelial cell protection assay and this remains to 
be confirmed in validation studies. The data are preliminary and it cannot be ascertained at this 
stage whether any activity seen is due to a pharmacological or physicochemical effect. The 
claimed cell-protection activities have not been sufficiently demonstrated. Further work to 
investigate and confirm these properties is needed.  
An updated expert statement provided by the applicant also claims a MoA for plasmin activation. 
The CHMP noted that a weak profibrinolytic effect has been shown and the MoA for Defibrotide is 
likely to be that of a weak fibrinolytic agent. The applicant has characterised defibrotide with 
several related profibrinolytic activity assays.  
The CHMP’ conclusions from the results of these assays is that the in vitro activity for fibrinolysis 
is weak and might even be seen as negligible when compared to negative controls and that the 
endothelial cell protection needs to be confirmed with more adequately designed studies.   
For both indications of treatment and prevention the absence of well characterised pharmacology 
and justified dose and posology highlights the need for clear evidence of efficacy. There is also 
uncertainty about the relevant dose to use and the optimal posology and optimal duration of 
infusions and number of days treatment required. This is because the dose-finding study did not 
demonstrate a dose-response either for the PD marker chosen of PAI-1 or for efficacy.  In the 
treatment indication, because the original HC group fulfilled the eligibility criteria for inclusion as 
pre-defined, the changes to the HC constitute a key confounding factor.  
The data from the additional open label interim analysis of study 2006-05, which compared the 
results with the final 32 HC subjects from study 2005-01, is not considered to provide reliable 
efficacy data either, considering that  these 32 HC subjects had a particularly poor outcome and do 
not constitute an acceptable control group.  Indeed the stringent criteria applied by the Medical 
Review Committee (MRC) in  choosing these 32 cases from the originally agreed HC group of 86 
subjects was to follow the patient progress over time in order to reach an “unequivocal” diagnosis 
of severe VOD. However, the notes from the TG were not subject to a similar MRC stringent 
blinded review. When the applicant then reviewed the TG with these criteria 4 (4%) of the TG were 
considered ineligible. It is noted that removal of these 4 cases would not impact on the overall data 
on CR from the trial but the differences highlight the difficulties with the amended HC group. A 
major GCP finding was that the processes for and documentation of the reduction in the HC group 
from 86 to 32 was unclear. This raises further concerns about the reliability of the 32 HC group. 
There is also uncertainty regarding the adequacy of the documentation available for the accurate 
diagnosis of VOD and also for the assignment of complete response. These combined uncertainties 
raise serious doubts as to the level of evidence provided in support of efficacy in the treatment 
indication. 
The only data where concomitant controls were used for a treatment indication in VOD was the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 84/135 
 
  
  
DF-VOD-Trial. In view of the widespread off-label use this trial failed to recruit and was terminated. 
Nonetheless there is data on complete response rates in each arm (n=34 in each arm) and no 
difference was found between the active and a concurrent control arm.   
For the single pivotal trial for prevention the weak efficacy seen is not considered to provide 
sufficient evidence for a clear conclusion that defibrotide is effective in preventing VOD. The small 
percentage difference (8%, 12 patients) between the two arms with borderline statistical 
significance is further reduced to a non-significant 6% (n=9) in the key sensitivity analysis of 
treating missing data as failure. Although the study was not powered for an effect on mortality, a 
trend in favour of the treatment arm would have provided additional support for a beneficial effect 
from treatment.   
The use of an Independent Review Committee can improve the reliability of data from an open 
label study; however, the independent review committee for the prevention trial did not have 
access to all of the subjects CRFs nor to all cases of “suspected VOD” and their input was restricted 
to cases where the investigator diagnosed VOD or administered DF.  This limits the strength of the 
data from this open label trial. 
The small difference in VOD at day 30 of 8% from this open label trial; the finding that the absolute 
difference falls to 6% when missing data is taken as failure and the concerns about the limited IRC 
input raises serious doubt as to the reliability of the results. This study is not considered sufficient 
to clearly demonstrate a beneficial effect from prophylactic defibrotide.  
The critical and major non GCP-compliance findings identified by the GCP inspection have resulted 
in the conclusion that it is not possible to rely on the integrity of the data and therefore the validity 
of the results is in serious doubt. Only with a second blinded prospective trial in adults and children 
would there be a sufficient level of evidence available on which to conclude on a beneficial effect 
from defibrotide. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Although haemorrhagic complications were anticipated with defibrotide, it is difficult to ascribe with 
any degree of certainty AEs to the treatment itself in post-SCT patients, particularly those with 
VOD. The lack of a clear dose-response in AEs from the dose-finding study in the overall population 
also suggests that the unfavourable effects of DF cannot be characterised with certainty from the 
clinical data provided.  An exception is the statistically significant differences in Kaplan-Meier 
estimates for survival (68.2% Arm A 25mg/kg/day, versus 32.5% arm B 40mg/kg/day, p= 0.0259) 
in those under 16 years, and this remains unexplained but does raise concerns regarding safety in 
children at doses higher that the proposed posology (25 mg/kg/day). 
In terms of trying to assess the safety of defibrotide in VOD in the absence of a control group with 
adequate safety data, the largest safety database where different doses were administered to VOD 
patients is from DF-CUP and these results suggest a dose-related increase in bleeding. There were 
18 deaths in DF-CUP considered possibly, probably or definitely related to defibrotide – all these 
deaths were as a result of haemorrhage or in one case coagulopathy. 9 children and 9 adults died 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 85/135 
 
 
 
  
  
and of the 18 subjects only one was on the low dose of 10mg/kg/day, 4 subjects received between 
20-40mg/kg/day, 12 received 40mg/kg/day or higher, and for one subject the dose was not 
provided. Also of note is that in one case where defibrotide was stopped due to bleeding and then 
re-started again eleven days later, a further bleeding episode occurred within 5 days of 
re-commencement and DF was discontinued. Although the applicant states that there was no 
increase in efficacy with the 40mg/kg/day dose it does seem that for fatal bleeding events there was 
an association with higher doses. 
Although no clear major signals for defibrotide related bleeding AEs across the clinical programme 
have been found, the relatedness of defibrotide to the signals seen cannot be clearly concluded in 
view of the lack of a concurrent control with VOD.   
The prevention trial does allow some comparison between arms. When comparing those in each 
arm who never developed VOD the safety profile of those on DF prophylaxis was worse than the 
placebo arm. Overall in the prevention trial a higher death rate of 25 (17%) in the defibrotide arm 
compared with 18 (13%) in the control arm was noted.  Although most deaths occurred more than 
1 month after cessation of defibrotide, in 7 cases AEs related to the death occurred during 
treatment with defibrotide or within one week of stopping defibrotide. Only one case of 
haemorrhage was considered as possibly related to defibrotide. Treatment discontinuation occurred 
in 5 (3%) in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm and these discontinuations were predominantly 
because of bleeding-related AEs during the prophylaxis phase. The reasons for discontinuation in 
the defibrotide prophylaxis arm included epistaxis, haemorrhagic cystitis, prolonged PT and GI 
haemorrhage. In the treatment phase 1 subject (4%) in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm and 4 
subjects (11%) in the control arm discontinued. The discontinuations in the treatment phase were 
predominantly for haemorrhage. 
The data from defibrotide use in other indications does raise a signal for occasional allergic 
reactions, but no such signal was seen in the clinical trials provided in support of VOD. Interpreting 
the significance of the safety data is difficult as it is not clear when the applicant changed the animal 
and tissue source of defibrotide as the older literature reports refer to defibrotide as being of 
“mammalian origin” or derived from “bovine lung”. As the defibrotide in this application for the 
pivotal trials is from porcine intestine, this is not identical to the product previously marketed by the 
applicant. 
In summary the unfavourable effects at present appear to be dose-related haemorrhage and 
increased toxicity (death) in children with the higher dose.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
From a quality perspective, the activity of defibrotide in the profibrinolytic and endothelial cell 
protection assay is weak and possibly confounded by the signal: noise ratio. Defibrotide is 
polydisperse and difficult to characterise using physicochemical tests, and together with the 
inability to show strong biological activity in an in vitro assay, the quality, consistency and control 
of defibrotide rests significantly on robust control over the manufacturing process. In view of the 
limitations in defining defibrotide from a quality perspective, and as no clear clinical correlation to 
quality attributes has been demonstrated, this could lead to significant challenges in confirming the 
quality of the product over the lifecycle of this polydisperse product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 86/135 
 
 
  
  
The finding of a dose-related increase in bleeding from DF-CUP is noted but in view of the open label 
nature of DF-CUP and the voluntary data provision by clinicians which is incomplete, firm 
conclusions cannot be drawn. 
There is only very limited data on PK of defibrotide in VOD. The lack of PK data in children and in 
those with renal failure, while both of these groups are included in the proposed indication of VOD, 
raises the level of uncertainly regarding the posology for children, in view of the safety signals at 
high doses, and in those with renal failure, as defibrotide is renally excreted and increased exposure 
will be expected in those with renal impairment. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Favourable effects from the treatment trial are not considered to have been demonstrated in view 
of the small and amended HC group chosen, where the documentation of the decision making 
process of the MRC to remove 54 from the original 86 cases was inadequate and a major GCP 
non-compliance. 
The favourable effect for prevention of VOD is based on a small difference of 6-8% in the 
prevention trial.  Such a small difference is not accepted as robust evidence of efficacy particularly 
when the data is from an open label, adaptive design trial. The critical and multiple major issues 
identified in the GCP inspection further add doubts to the reliability and integrity of the data from 
the prevention trial. 
The unfavourable effects of defibrotide have not been clearly elucidated, although a dose-related 
increase in bleeding and increased mortality with higher exposure in children was seen. In addition 
effects such as those associated with prolonged infusions and the administration of an animal 
product carry additional risks including administration-associated AEs and allergic reactions to the 
product.   
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefits demonstrated from the treatment trial are considered unreliable in view of the 
multiple amendments and changes to the HC group during the conduct of the study. For a single 
pivotal open label trial the use of a historical control group and the choice of that group needs to 
be transparent and the process GCP compliant. The GCP findings that the processes for and 
documentation of the revision of the HC group were not transparent add to the concern about this 
HC group as a valid and reliable comparator group.  
The only data where concomitant controls were used for the treatment indication was 
DF-VOD-Trial, which was terminated early due to inadequate recruitment. No difference was seen 
between concurrent control (n=34) and treatment arms (n=34) in terms of complete response. 
The lack of a dose-response results from study 99-118 also raises doubts about the effect of 
defibrotide.   
The benefits demonstrated are considered very weak for the prevention indication and the level of 
difference between the two arms for prevention cannot be considered to provide sufficient 
evidence to support efficacy from a single open label trial.  In the absence of a well-characterised 
pharmacology profile the requirements of a single pivotal study are higher. The small difference in

VOD at day 30 of 8% between the defibrotide and control arm is not considered sufficient to clearly 
demonstrate a beneficial effect from defibrotide and may be due to chance.  Further compounding 
the acceptance of the reliability of the results is the very restricted IRC input which was limited to 
cases where the investigator has diagnosed VOD or administered defibrotide. The GCP inspection 
identified critical and multiple major non-compliances which undermine the integrity of the data 
from this study. It is considered that the data provided in support of the prevention of VOD 
indication lacks the level of reliability and robustness which are required from a single pivotal trial. 
The risks are those associated with administration of prolonged frequent IV treatments and in 
addition the administration of an animal-derived product. In terms of clarification of the safety 
profile of DF, one of the proposed MoAs is a weak profibrinolytic effect and this raises concern 
about increased bleeding in a group where haemorrhage occurs frequently due to concomitant 
factors. Without a comparison between a defibrotide group and a placebo/physician’s choice group, 
AEs cannot be attributed clearly to the defibrotide in the setting of post-SCT patients with VOD.  
Additional risks are the lack of information on PK in children and in those with renal failure where 
in view of the trend for increased haemorrhages in higher dose patients in DF-CUP, together with 
increased deaths in children in the high dose group raise the need for further PK data in these 
groups. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy of Defitelio in the following 
indications: 
Defitelio is indicated for the prevention of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) also 
known as Sinusoidal Obstructive (SOS) in haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation 
therapy. 
Defitelio is indicated for the treatment of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) also 
known as Sinusoidal Obstructive (SOS) in haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation 
therapy. 
The CHMP considers by consensus that the efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product is 
not sufficiently demonstrated, and therefore, pursuant to Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, recommends the refusal of Marketing Authorisation for the above mentioned medicinal 
product. 
The CHMP considers that: 
One open label pivotal trial was provided in support of the prevention indication. The statistical 
significance of the results was not sufficiently convincing in the context of a single pivotal trial. 
Furthermore critical and major GCP non-compliances relating to the documentation and reporting of 
efficacy, the lack of clarity in the protocol and the differences in interpretation of the protocol at the 
two sites inspected raise doubts as to the reliability and generalizability of the data. It was therefore 
not possible to conclude that efficacy had been demonstrated in the prevention of hepatic 
veno-occlusive disease.

One open label pivotal trial was provided in support of the treatment indication. The historical 
control group was not considered a suitable control arm in view of the small size, the timeframe of 
recruitment and the amendment to the historical control group where 54 subjects were removed. In 
addition, the lack of transparency in the processes and decision making relating to the amendment 
of the historical control group raise further uncertainty as to the reliability of the final 32 subjects 
chosen. It was therefore not possible to conclude that efficacy has been demonstrated in the 
treatment of hepatic veno-occlusive disease. 
5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 21 March 2013 
Following the CHMP conclusion that Defitelio was not approvable for the treatment of:  
Defitelio is indicated for the prevention of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) also 
known as Sinusoidal Obstructive syndrome (SOS) in haematopoietic stem-cell 
transplantation therapy. 
Defitelio is indicated for the treatment of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) also 
known as Sinusoidal Obstructive syndrome (SOS) in haematopoietic stem-cell 
transplantation therapy. 
as the efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product was not sufficiently demonstrated, the 
applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.  
5.1.  Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The applicant presented in writing and at an oral explanation their grounds that the adopted CHMP 
opinion may not have considered the data fully and also provided further information. The applicant 
presented the revised indication: 
• 
• 
Prevention of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), also known as sinusoidal obstructive 
syndrome (SOS), in high risk patients undergoing haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation 
therapy (HSCT) 
Treatment of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), also known as sinusoidal 
obstructive syndrome (SOS), in haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation therapy (HSCT) 
During the oral explanation held on the 22 July 2013, the applicant explained that the prophylactic 
indication for defibrotide had been withdrawn. The applicant presented the following grounds for 
re-examination: 
The applicant emphasises that for the treatment indication, efficacy data from controlled trials show 
positive effects of defibrotide and this is supported by data from other sources. The safety profile of 
defibrotide has been well characterised using a large database given the orphan indication. The 
identified risk of bleeding can be very effectively managed in the specialist centres where 
defibrotide will be prescribed and the clinicians are very confident in their ability to administer the 
drug safely.  
In summary, for defibrotide, there is a large database of clinical experience and the applicant has 
provided the CHMP with as full information as can be obtained not only from formal controlled 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 89/135 
 
 
 
  
  
clinical trials but also from an on-going treatment IND (2006-05), an independent US registry, 
additional studies, the literature, and the compassionate use program. Overall the balance of 
Benefit/Risk is favourable in these very small populations. 
The applicant addresses specifically the CHMP’s grounds for refusal as follows: 
Ground 1 
One open label pivotal trial was provided in support of the prevention indication.  
1.a The statistical significance of the results was not sufficiently convincing in the context of a single 
pivotal trial. 
1.b Critical and major GCP non-compliances relating to the documentation and reporting of efficacy 
1.c the lack of clarity in the protocol and the differences in interpretation of the protocol at the two 
sites inspected raise doubts as to the reliability and generalizability of the data. 
1.a Statistical significance of the results was not sufficiently convincing in the context of a single 
pivotal trial 
Consistent with the submitted evidence, the Applicant points out that the prevention study 
(2004-000592-33) was conducted exclusively in the paediatric population as these children are 
considered to be at higher risk of developing VOD than the adult population. This study is the largest 
study ever performed for this orphan disease in the paediatric HSCT population. The study protocol 
was jointly developed with the Paediatric Working Party of the European Group for Blood and 
Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and the EBMT co-sponsored the trial. The study is a controlled, 
multicentre, prospective, randomised 1:1 study, comparing prophylaxis with defibrotide versus no 
treatment (control). Rescue medication was provided only after the primary endpoint (development 
of VOD) was assessed so this did not impact the interpretation of the study primary results. 
However, in the Applicants’ view, the analysis of secondary and exploratory endpoints evaluating 
differences between the subsets of patients who developed VOD in the different treatment groups 
must be interpreted with caution because secondary endpoints compared two strategies, 
defibrotide prophylaxis plus defibrotide treatment versus no defibrotide prophylaxis plus defibrotide 
treatment.  
An Independent Review Committee (IRC) comprising independent clinical experts, who were not 
involved with the conduct of the study, was tasked with adjudicating diagnoses, thus ensuring 
independence and reliability of the results. The IRC conducted its review of patient data in a blinded 
fashion without knowledge of which treatment group the patients were allocated to. The study 
enrolled 356 patients from 28 paediatric HSCT centres in 11 countries and took nearly four years to 
complete. 
The applicant reiterates that the study met its pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint in the 
intention-to-treat (ITT) population demonstrating that defibrotide prophylaxis significantly reduced 
the incidence of VOD with a conventionally accepted two-sided alpha p-value <0.05. The size of 
reduction from 20% in the control arm (35/176) to 12% (22/180) in the defibrotide arm, represents 
a relative reduction of 40% in the incidence of VOD. In addition to the primary analysis of VOD 
incidence by Day+30, secondary analyses from this study are consistent and support the conclusion 
of the primary endpoint. The percentage of patients developing severe VOD was 6% in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 90/135 
 
  
  
defibrotide prophylaxis arm and 10% in the control arm and the pattern of organ failure shows a 
benefit for defibrotide prophylaxis.  
1.b Critical and major GCP non-compliances relating to the documentation and reporting of efficacy 
The Applicant’s view is that many of the GCP findings reflect some confusion about how the 
diagnosis of VOD is made. The diagnosis of VOD is in fact well-understood and clearly described. 
The sites involved with this study were all registered by the EBMT and this group has issued clear 
guidance for the 2-stage differential diagnosis of VOD.  
Regarding the GCP findings related to VOD diagnosis (clinical judgment versus ultrasound results), 
the Applicants’ view is that there is a misunderstanding of how the diagnosis is made and the role 
of ultrasound in the diagnostic process. Ultrasonography assessments are not considered the basis 
of diagnosis of VOD but in some cases supportive and useful for confirmatory purposes.  
Regarding the lack of unified set of objective rules in diagnosing VOD, the Applicant accepts the fact 
that ideally some of these aspects (e.g., baseline time point from which the weight change was to 
be calculated) could have been defined in the study protocol, but the Applicant understood that 
there are internationally accepted guidelines to diagnose VOD as reflected in the EBMT Handbook. 
Other GCP concern relating to the open label nature of the study included the possibility that 
investigators were more inclined to start defibrotide treatment at the first sign of VOD for the 
control group because of the fear of disease progression and that investigators could be more 
sanguine with the prophylaxis arm because subjects were on defibrotide and as a result be less 
likely to report mild or suspect VOD cases. The Applicant’s position was that these concerns were 
not based on evidence that subjects in the control group who were referred to the Independent 
Review Committee for adjudication of the VOD diagnosis did not have a higher proportion of 'mild 
VOD' reported and that VOD cases in the control group were more severe than those who received 
defibrotide prophylaxis.  
The applicant has provided information as to whether the GCP findings had an impact on the study 
results. The Independent Review Committees (IRC), a group of specialists blinded to treatment 
group and the investigator’s final view of whether VOD was present or not, added a layer of 
independent adjudication to the primary endpoint of VOD diagnosis. In addition to all cases where 
the investigator diagnosed VOD, the IRC was sent all cases where the patient received ‘treatment 
defibrotide’ as that implied a provisional diagnosis of VOD, and so all these cases were also fully 
reviewed by the IRC.  
Since some concerns remain about the IRC adjudication step, the Applicant has performed various 
sensitivity analyses. The sensitivity analyses set higher thresholds than the modified Seattle criteria 
as used in the protocol, so only the more serious cases of VOD would be included i.e., Seattle 
criteria with hyperbilirubinemia (comparable with Baltimore criteria), Seattle criteria with MOF, or 
Seattle criteria with both hyperbilirubinemia and MOF. The results are consistent whether the 
Seattle criteria are used, or alternative criteria that set a higher threshold of disease severity. 
Whichever criteria are used, a consistent relationship between defibrotide prophylaxis and control is 
observed, with defibrotide use consistently conferring at least a 40% reduction in the risk of 
developing VOD at any given threshold of severity.  
In addition to these sensitivity analyses, a new Expert Panel was convened by the Applicant to 
review data from this study. This new group of experts reviewed a sample of approximately 10% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 91/135 
 
  
  
the patient’s data from the study. The new Expert Panel concluded that the issues identified in the 
study would not have affected the reliability of the results. 
1.c  the lack of clarity in the protocol and the differences in interpretation of the protocol at the two 
sites inspected raise doubts as to the reliability and generalizability of the data. 
Since the GCP inspectors observed the possible differences between sites and raised concerns 
about the ‘reliability and generalisability’ of the data, the applicant generated Forest plots with 95% 
CIs (by centre, by country and by baseline prognostic factors). There is a considerable overlap 
across the centres and the observed centre differences are consistent with chance. The Forest plots 
have been based on differences in the incidence rates for VOD (not odds ratios) since in some sites 
there was no VOD event in the treatment group.  
Forest plots include CIs have also been generated grouping the sites by country to investigate 
country differences (Austria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Israel, Italy, 
Netherlands, and Sweden). No events were observed for any of the sites in Switzerland and that 
country has therefore been omitted from this analysis. In addition, Forest plots have been 
generated by presence of background risk factors together with p-values for interaction. These 
analyses support the presence of a consistent treatment effect across the various subgroups 
defined by baseline factors. There is no evidence from these analyses that the treatment effect 
lacks consistency.  
Taken together these analyses comparing the treatment effect across centres, across countries and 
for different levels of the key baseline prognostic factors strongly support a consistent treatment 
difference for the population as a whole and the external validity of the trial. 
An apparent survival benefit was seen for patients developing VOD following defibrotide prophylaxis 
and for patients given immediate treatment with defibrotide upon the diagnosis of VOD, compared 
with waiting until VOD is established.  
Regarding the ‘generalisability’ of the data, it is acknowledged that the initial indication statement, 
‘prevention of VOD’, was inclusive of all patients and this study was performed only in those at high 
risk of developing VOD. The Applicant proposed to modify the indication statement “… in high risk 
patients in haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation therapy (HSCT)”. 
Ground 2 
One open label pivotal trial was provided in support of the treatment indication.  
2.a The historical control group was not considered a suitable control arm in view of the small size. 
2.b The timeframe of recruitment and the amendment to the historical control group where 54 
subjects were removed.  
2.c The lack of transparency in the processes and decision making relating to the amendment of the 
historical control group raise further uncertainty as to the reliability of the final 32 subjects chosen. 
2.a The historical control group was not considered a suitable control arm in view of the small size. 
This orphan indication of severe VOD associated with multi organ failure is applicable to fewer than 
1000 patients per year in the EU. There was an ethical problem with conducting a 
placebo-controlled study in this indication because of the risk of death if severe VOD is left 
untreated. This pivotal study was conducted in adult and paediatric patients suffering from severe 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 92/135 
 
 
  
  
VOD with multi organ failure. The applicant accepts that the historical control group was not ideal 
but it was considered the best option conducting a study in this life-threatening disease. The 
primary efficacy endpoint was the complete response of severe VOD (defined as total bilirubin 
below 2 mg/dL (34 μmol/L) and resolution of all multi organ failure). A key secondary endpoint was 
Day+100 mortality. Mortality rate in the 2005-01 HC group was 75.0% at Day+100 post HSCT. This 
was consistent with the available literature. One hundred and two patients suffering from severe 
VOD with multi organ failure were recruited to the Treatment Group (TG) and 32 to the Historical 
Control (HC) group. The study showed a significant difference in the primary efficacy endpoint 
(Complete Response, CR) in favour of the defibrotide-treated patients. A total of 23.5% of patients 
in the defibrotide treatment group achieved CR compared with only 9.4% in the HC group 
(p=0.0131). Mortality in the defibrotide TG compared with the HC group was decreased; 38% of the 
TG were alive at Day+100 vs 25% of the HC group. 
Whilst the use of an historical control in this indication has been accepted, the validity of the actual 
HC group used has been questioned. The patients included in the HC arm were selected by an 
independent Medical Review Committee (MRC) who were kept blinded to the outcome. The finally 
agreed HC group was comprised of 32 patients. Although small, this percentage of the total HSCT 
patients finally included in the HC (0.5%) was similar to the percentage of patients screened and 
finally included in the defibrotide treatment group (0.9%).  
2.b The timeframe of recruitment and the amendment to the historical control group where 54 
subjects were removed.  
Regarding the timeframe of recruitment there is a concern related to the fact that the HC arm 
included patients transplanted between 1995 and 2006 and the dataset was considered rather old. 
The Applicant has pointed out that the majority of the HC patients (21/32) were recruited from the 
year 2000 onwards. Some concern was raised that in the refinement of the HC group from 86 to 32 
patients, the more historic patients data may have been included preferentially and that these 
patients might have been expected to have a worse outcome. The mortality rate of the HC used in 
the 2005-01 study (75.0% at Day+100 post HSCT) is consistent with the literature, which provides 
an additional external validation for its use as a control in this study.  
Regarding the amendment to the historical control group, the Applicant has provided further 
information on the fact that the 54 patients not included in the HC group were removed because the 
MRC (blinded to patient outcome), upon review, considered that the signs/symptoms evident in 
these patients were more likely due to an alternate aetiology, and not due to VOD-associated MOF, 
or because they met an exclusion criterion for the study. The stringency applied by the MRC in 
reaching an unequivocal diagnosis of severe VOD was to ensure they underwent a similar level of 
stringency to that applied to the TG patients in the clinic. It became apparent during the study that 
once potential TG patients were identified, the TG investigators performed differential diagnosis in 
line with internationally accepted standard practices in order to confirm the diagnosis of VOD with 
associated MOF. This standard clinical approach was in line with the EBMT guideline. These 
guidelines require the exclusion of alternate aetiologies that might have caused the patients’ signs 
and symptoms. Therefore it was necessary to request that the independent MRC follow the same 
approach for the identification of the HC patients as well.  
In summary, the approach taken to include patients into the TG and HC groups with VOD  was 
equally stringent in both arms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 93/135 
 
  
  
In the HC group, similarly the MRC were allowed to request information from the patient notes for 
a few days after they met the initial inclusion criteria for the study so that the MRC could review the 
possibility that other aetiologies were the cause of the signs and symptoms. 
It is of crucial importance to note that the MRC were blinded to patient outcome when they 
performed their decision making to include/not include patients in the HC Group. 
2.c The lack of transparency in the processes and decision making relating to the amendment of the 
historical control group raise further uncertainty as to the reliability of the final 32 subjects chosen. 
This concern relates to the GCP findings on the process for inclusion of the patients into the HC 
group. The physician’s clinical diagnoses involve a 2-step process with inclusion criteria which must 
be met followed by exclusion of signs and symptoms caused by alternative aetiologies prior to 
diagnosing VOD.   
It is worth reiterating that the independent MRC, composed of leading haematologists, was blinded 
to patient outcome throughout the entire process when they conducted their deliberations about 
whether patients should be included in the HC group. During the initial reviews by MRC, the 
committee gathered all patients who met the inclusion criteria for the diagnosis of VOD. The second 
step was the exclusion, by differential diagnosis, of those patients with other conditions. Within the 
clinics treating the VOD patients in the TG, the second step of the exclusion criteria for VOD and/or 
MOF associated with VOD was applied extremely thoroughly and excluded patients unless the 
diagnosis was unequivocal i.e. VOD with MOF associated with the VOD as opposed to any other 
possible aetiologies. Equal rigor was applied in selecting the HC patients.  
In addition, the reasons for non-inclusion of every patient were clearly listed in the MRC 
documentation. The Applicant acknowledged that not every diagnostic consideration was recorded, 
however the MRC document provide details on non-inclusion patients. In order to know the Impact 
of GCP Findings on Results, two approaches have been taken by the Applicant. The first one is a 
comparison of the baseline characteristics of the HC group vs the TG. The second approach was the 
performance of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the results when different inclusion 
criteria are applied. 
Regarding the comparison of the baseline characteristics of the HC group vs the TG, the results 
show no clinically meaningful differences in the distribution of these factors between the 32 HC 
patients, and the TG, and support that the HC and the TG were well-balanced and comparable. 
In connection with the second approach to know the impact of the GCP findings on the results, the 
Applicant has performed three sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the data.  These 
sensitivity analyses address concerns (a) about the amount of time taken for diagnosis of VOD with 
MOF in the 2 groups and (b) to evaluate whether applying a greater level of stringency to the TG 
would have made a material difference to the results. 
Regarding the time taken to make a diagnosis, concerns were raised about the time taken to 
determine the diagnosis of VOD and the question was asked whether the time taken in the HC 
meant that there was a greater stringency applied to the HC than the TG.   
In fact, for both the HC and the TG, there was a very similar pattern in the period of time taken to 
determine a diagnosis of VOD. In general, a diagnosis of VOD can be made for the majority of 
patients within 2 days; this was the case for 81% of the patients in the HC and 78% of patients in 
the TG. Because the assessor raised doubts about the accuracy of the diagnosis of patients for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 94/135 
 
  
  
whom determination of VOD took longer than 2 days, the applicant has performed a sensitivity 
analysis including only those patients in whom a diagnosis of VOD was confirmed within 2 days. In 
this population, 27.5% (22/80) TG patients were complete responders compared with 11.5% 
(3/26) in the HC group, with a p value of 0.0076. Regarding survival, 38.8% (31/80) of TG patients 
survived compared with 23.1% (6/26) of patients in the HC Group, with a p value of 0.0345. 
Therefore, if the applicant had excluded patients for whom definitive diagnosis took more than 2 
days, this would have made no difference qualitatively to the conclusions. 
Applying a greater level of stringency to the TG, two sensitivity analyses have been undertaken. The 
first excludes patients who were, after recruitment, considered to be protocol violators and the 
second excludes patients in the TG that according to the GCP inspectors may not have met an 
unequivocal diagnosis of VOD with associated MOF. 
There were 4 patients in the TG who were eventually considered to be violators. Since none of these 
4 TG patients were complete responders, if the applicant had excluded these patients from the TG, 
this would only have led to a greater difference in favour of defibrotide in CR rate between the TG 
and the HC group; instead of 23.5% (24/102) TG patients being complete responders compared 
with 9.4% (3/32) in the HC group, the revised figures would be 24.5%(24/98) versus 9.4%, with a 
p-value of 0.0117 compared with the p-value for the whole group of 0.0131. Regarding mortality, 
instead of 61.8% (63/102) TG patients dying compared with 75.0% (24/32) in HC Group, the 
revised figures would be 60.2% (59/98) versus 75.0% with a p-value of 0.0268 compared with a 
p-value for the ITT group of 0.0341. 
There were 8 patients in the TG that the GCP inspectors quoted as in their view, not meeting an 
unequivocal diagnosis of VOD with associated MOF (6 who were taking nephrotoxic drugs where the 
renal failure might possibly have been considered due to the drugs and not the VOD and 2 who had 
pulmonary infections that were considered by the GCP inspectors to possibly have been the 
underlying cause of the pulmonary failure). Notwithstanding that the applicant would strongly 
argue that the treating investigators are best placed to evaluate a diagnosis of VOD, especially since 
the investigators would have been able to amend the use of the drugs and review other aspects of 
infection and take an overall view of the condition of the patient, the applicant has evaluated the 
impact of exclusion of these patients. Once again, the results were unaffected. For Complete 
Response, instead of 23.5% (24/102) TG patients being complete responders compared with 9.4% 
(3/32) in the HC group, the revised figure would be 24.5% (23/94) compared with 9.4%, with a 
p-value of 0.0110 compared with the p-value for the whole group of 0.0131. Regarding survival, 
instead of 38.2% (39/102) TG patients alive at Day+100 compared with 25.0% (8/32) in HC Group, 
the revised figures would be 38.3% (36/94) vs 25.0% (8/32) with a p-value of 0.0432 compared 
with a p-value for the whole group of 0.0341. 
In summary, there is no evidence that the HC patients were not well balanced and comparable with 
the TG patients. The mortality of the HC group (75.0%) is in fact slightly lower than predicted by the 
literature for this life-threatening disease (>84.0%; Coppell, 2010). The stringent review process 
ensured that only patients with an unequivocal diagnosis of severe VOD with multi organ failure 
were recruited to the HC group to allow appropriate comparison with the TG.

5.2.  Additional expert consultation- Report from the Ad hoc expert 
group meeting 
Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened an Ad 
hoc Expert Group inviting the experts, including a patient representative, to provide their views on 
the questions posed by the CHMP, taking into account the applicant’s response to the grounds for 
refusal. 
5.2.1.  Prevention indication 
1.a. Considering the methodological and GCP weaknesses as pointed out by the inspectors (single 
pivotal study, open-label, allowance of defibrotide as rescue for control patients, potential 
differences in the work-up for establishing the VOD diagnosis among centres etc.) do you feel that 
the fact that the study met its pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint in the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
population demonstrating that defibrotide prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of VOD 
with a conventionally accepted two-sided alpha p-value <0.05, represents a sufficient 
demonstration of clinical efficacy? 
b. Considering the methodological and GCP weaknesses, is the demonstration of benefit convincing 
by itself or of any support to the treatment study?  
c. An incidence of 20% in the control arm (35/176) was reduced to 12% (22/180) in the defibrotide 
arm (p=0.0488).  Is the difference clinically meaningful? 
The experts were of the opinion that, although a 40% reduction in incidence of VOD is considered 
clinically meaningful, the results are not sufficiently robust to demonstrate clinical efficacy in the 
prevention indication and should rather be viewed as a signal. The experts noted that there is a 
significant number of study confounders and that the methodological issues remain the main 
weaknesses of the study and do not allow for a positive conclusion. Furthermore, the pivotal study 
did not demonstrate any survival advantage for the defibrotide group. There was also concern 
regarding a safety signal of increased death in patients who had been given defibrotide as 
prophylaxis and not developed VOD when compared with patients not given prophylaxis who did not 
develop VOD.  
The group agreed that in general, the GCP findings are considered less of a concern regarding the 
interpretation of the outcome of the study; nevertheless the study results are on their own not 
convincing enough for the prophylaxis indication. However, the group agreed that the results of 
those who were treated for VOD were consistent with the results of the treatment study. The 
experts were of the view that only by performing further studies would there be a sufficient level of 
evidence available on which to conclude on a beneficial effect of DF in the prophylaxis of VOD.  
5.2.2.  Treatment indication 
2. 
Considering the issues raised against the screening for identification of an adequate 
historical control (HC) group that ended with 32 patients with unequivocal VOD diagnosis would it 
be possible to look at the data as the results of a simple phase II study and assess clinical benefit 
on a VOD CR rate at D100 of 24%.     
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 96/135 
 
  
  
The experts agreed that looking at the data as a simple phase II trial would not be adequate. The 
VOD CR rate at D100 is not an appropriate endpoint for this indication and should be considered a 
surrogate one as it does not allow for an assessment of overall clinical benefit. In their view, the 
applicant could have chosen a more appropriate end point (i.e: overall survival).  
3. 
If the answer to question 1 is no, do you think that the applicant has applied sufficient 
meticulous diagnostic criteria (blinded MRC, strict application of the Seattle Criteria as first step, 
and strict exclusion of other aetiologies) to convince you that the Historical Control group albeit 
small represents a sufficient external control. 
The experts noted the fact that a high number of patients (54 out of 86) had been excluded from the 
control group due to alternative aetiologies, which resulted in a very small final HC group 
comprising 32 patients in total. It was further noted that the trial did not meet the pre-specified 
significance level of 1% due to the small patient numbers included, and that only a trend in favour 
of DF had been shown. However, the experts were of the view that the HC group, although small, 
was appropriately chosen and could be accepted as comparable to the treatment group and the best 
available control group in the clinical trial setting. Thus, it was considered that the historical control 
group chosen represents an appropriate external control. Based on this, the experts supported the 
rapporteur’s view on the treatment indication. 
4. 
Do you consider peer-reviewed literature and the independent US REGISTRY data 
supportive of treatment benefit or should such data be dismissed in the drug approval procedure. 
The expert group agreed with the fact that independent registry data can be considered supportive 
of a benefit in the treatment of VOD. Overall, the expert group agreed that independent registry 
data can be useful if the study endpoints are clearly defined. 
In the experts’ views, recent registry data indicate that patients who do not receive DF still have a 
high mortality rate. In addition the US REGISTRY data support the fact that DF increases the VOD 
resolution rate and reduces the mortality rate. 
Furthermore, the group agreed that peer review literature is also considered generally supportive of 
the treatment indication for DF, although less so than independent registry data in view of the 
frequent methodological limitations observed.  
5.3.  Additional information provided by the applicant 
During the Oral Explanation on 22 July 2013, the applicant provided additional clarification on the 
following issues: 
1.  The 'treatment study' is formally a failed study if starting pre-planned rules are considered: the 
risk was set at a value of 0.01 to take into account the relatively low robustness of the study 
design. Alternative and simple statistical analyses further decrease the global robustness of an 
efficacy conclusion (24/102 vs 3/32, hi-square test p = 0.0816; Fisher's test p = 0.1275). 
Please discuss (i) the use and validity of a stratified analysis on a propensity score, as opposed 
to a simpler analysis, (ii) the discrepancies between the possible statistical analyses and (iii) the 
overall statistical reliability of the efficacy conclusion in the treatment indication. 
2.  Please provide further justification for the use of other external (historical) control data in 
support of the small HC group (CIBMT data, US treatment-IND study, others).

5.4.  Discussion on grounds for re-examination 
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by 
the applicant and considered the views of the ad hoc expert group meeting held on 8 July 2013. 
Ground 1 
The CHMP noted that the difference between the active arm (20%) and control arm (12%), i.e., 
8%, for the primary efficacy endpoint is only of borderline statistical significance: p = 0.0488 and 
thus cannot be considered as providing the compelling scientific evidence that would be required in 
the context of a single pivotal trial for the prevention indication.  
The lack of robustness of the results is illustrated by the results of the sensitivity analyses which fail 
to confirm significance:  p = 0.0507 for Analysis A2 (Kaplan Meier, available data), p = 0.0644 for 
Analysis B (Multiple imputation) and p = 0.1937 for Analysis C (Worst case). 
Moreover, this study presents several methodological weaknesses: 
- Open label study: this is a serious limitation for a single pivotal study where the primary endpoint 
is not as clearly objective as a single centralised laboratory parameter or mortality would be. 
- The contribution of the independent review panel is limited to review cases only for whom a 
diagnosis of VOD was made by the investigator. This restriction weakens the IRC contribution to the 
study. 
- No clear advantage in overall survival at Day 180. 
Regarding the problems associated with the trial design and conduct, the results on VOD at day 30 
cannot be considered as sufficient to clearly demonstrate a beneficial effect from defibrotide. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that although the study has met its pre-specified primary endpoint,  
despite the size of the study the results are not considered sufficiently convincing because of 
methodological and GCP wweaknesses (single pivotal study, open-label, allowance of defibrotide as 
rescue for control patients, potential differences in the work-up for establishing the VOD diagnosis 
among centers).  
The treatment difference is small in absolute terms and may be of borderline significance. The 
overall borderline result for the primary endpoint makes any subgroup or sensitivity analysis 
difficult to interpret. The results for the secondary endpoints give little support because of the 
allowance of defibrotide as rescue in control patients. The CHMP therefore maintain the view that 
efficacy of defibrotide in the prevention of VOD is not established. 
The proposed restriction of indication to high risk patients would not lift the doubts about 
generalisability of the data to real life even though a smaller target population may be more 
representative of the inclusion population of the study (i.e., high risk patients). 
During the re-examination procedure, at the oral explanation held on the 22 July 2013, the 
applicant withdrew the prevention indication, limiting the claimed indication of defibrotide only to 
the treatment population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 98/135 
 
  
  
Ground 2 
For the treatment indication the applicant provided data from study 2005-01, a phase II study 
including 102 patients with severe VOD/MOF showing a CR rate by Day 100 of 24% and a mortality 
rate by Day 100 of 62%. Due to the uncontrolled nature of the study some type of external control 
is necessary as a control group of only 32 patients is too limited and cannot stand alone. The 
controversial issue was the removal of 54/86 patients due to alternative aetiologies resulting in a 
very small final HC group of 32 patients. The applicant has provided the reasons given by the MRC 
for patients’ exclusions and have compared the reasons with exclusion/inclusion criteria of the 
treatment protocol. The CHMP’s view is that the MRC did not preferentially select patients with a 
particular poor outcome for the HC group. In addition, the reasons for not including the 54 patients 
appear to be sufficiently documented. The exclusion of 10/86 patients due to insufficient record 
data is not an issue considering the inherent problems with the use of retrospective clinical data.  
It is acknowledged that a placebo-controlled study is not feasible. Therefore, the CHMP’s view is 
that the results in the treatment group in terms of percentage of patients who have complete 
resolution of severe VOD by Day 100 post SCT and complete resolution of multi organ failure (MOF) 
as well as survival rate Day 100 should either be evaluated on their own merits or compared with an 
adequate external historical control. In other words, since there are concerns about the nature of 
the HC group and running a controlled study in this indication is not possible, it is appropriate to 
consider additional sources of data that could support study control data provided by the Applicant. 
Registry data have been the major driver in the advances of allogeneic HSCT in the absence of 
randomised clinical trials (conditioning regimens, anti-GVHD prophylaxis and therapies, infection 
prophylaxis). The CHMP’s view is that there appears to be a treatment effect in severe VOD and the 
high mortality for severe VOD from the literature and the finally chosen historical control group 
suggest that DF is of use. The mortality of sVOD is reported to be in excess of 85% without DF 
treatment. 
Assessment report

Page 99/135 
 
  
  
Figure 1:  Study 2005-01: Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves for Deﬁbrotide TG and HC 
Patients 
The CHMP also agrees that the mortality of patients with severe VOD/MOF using supportive therapy 
without defibrotide has remained quite constant over two decades despite other therapeutic 
improvements for patients undergoing HSCT and that the mortality rate of 62% compares 
favourably with the expected mortality rate of 75-85% . 
The US treatment-IND study (2006-05) is an open study treating patients with VOD in US and the 
results were presented at ASH 2012. These results also indicate a reduction in Day 100 mortality as 
compared to the expected 75-85%. 
The Applicant also provided additional data analysis from a US Registry as an external comparator 
(2008-2011 timeframe). All data analyses were performed by the US Registry statistical group in 
Wisconsin directly from the Registry dataset. The applicant provided analyses of sVOD patients 
(Baltimore criteria + MOF) treated and not treated with defibrotide. 
The number of patients with comprehensive records in the transplant registry was 8341, and of 
these, 275 were reported to have VOD (3.2%), with 101 [Note: Of the 101 patients, 2 were 
excluded from further analysis because it is unknown whether they received any treatment; 3 
patients were excluded because it is unknown whether they received deﬁbrotide or standard of 
care, so in the sVOD group 96 records could be evaluated for outcomes] patients meeting the 
definition of severe VOD (1.2%). This confirms the rarity of the condition and is also a similarly 
small proportion to that included in the TG and HC groups of the 2005-01 study.  
In patients who were reported not to have received any specific interventions for their VOD, a 
mortality rate of 78% showed that despite any improvements in supportive care, the mortality rate 
remains very high with this disease. This US Registry  data could provide an estimate of the effect 
size that can be expected in the clinic under real life conditions. Day+100 survival of patients 
treated with standard of care (SOC) plus defibrotide was 39% compared with 31% for patients 
treated with SOC alone. VOD resolution occurred in 51% of the patients treated with SOC plus 
defibrotide compared with 29% of patients treated with SOC alone.

The following endpoints of relevance in the treatment of sVOD were presented in 2 sub-groups; 
those receiving/not receiving defibrotide with no other treatments, and those receiving/not 
receiving defibrotide with standard of care treatments (such as diuretics, steroids, Ursodiol, etc.):

Taking the most conservative comparison i.e., between the TG from study 2005-01 and the US 
REGISTRY non-defibrotide treated group, there is an absolute 7% benefit in favour of defibrotide, 
giving a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 14 to save one life (Figure 3). The data from the US 
REGISTRY registry substantiate the clinical benefit seen for defibrotide in the 2005-01 study. Taking 
all the data into consideration, the weight of the evidence suggest a survival benefit for defibrotide 
in the treatment of severe VOD. 
Figure 3: 
2005-01 Treatment Group vs US REGISTRY no Defibrotide 
The only treatment trial where there was a concurrent control group for VOD (mixed VOD ~50% 
severe) was DF-VOD. Although the trial was terminated due to slow enrolment and as a result only 
34 subjects were included in each arm, the interim analysis results were on randomised patients 
only (twelve patients were included in the observational registry at time of the interim analysis but 
were not included in the results). 
Only primary endpoints were analysed in the interim analysis. Eleven patients (32.4%) of the 
Defibrotide group and 15 patients (44.1%) of the Control group were considered to have had a 
Complete Remission (Complete Response) by Day +100. Twenty-one patients (61.8%) of the 
Defibrotide group and 20 patients (58.8%) of the Control died by Day+100. No trend for a beneficial 
effect from defibrotide in either CR or mortality was seen. While this randomised study failed to 
show a benefit, it has limited numbers of subjects and based on the totality of the data, including 
the ongoing IND and the US REGISTRY data, CHMP considered that sufficient supportive evidence 
has been provided in support of the revised treatment indication.   
In conclusion, following the assessment of the detailed grounds for refusal provided by the 
applicant, and in view of the revised indication proposed, the CHMP is of the view that the benefit 
risk balance of the above mentioned medicinal product can be considered positive in the treatment 
indication on the following grounds: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 102/135 
 
 
 
  
  
• 
• 
• 
The HC group cannot stand alone but it is accepted that even recent registry data indicate that 
patients who do not receive defibrotide still have a very high mortality rate;  
The US treatment IND- study (2006-05) although uncontrolled indicate a beneficial effect on 
mortality of defibrotide; 
The US REGISTRY data support that defibrotide increases the VOD resolution rate and reduces 
the mortality rate;  
•  External control data is the only possible comparison. 
5.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements. 
5.6.  Risk Management Plan 
Based on the review of the Risk Management Plan version 1.0, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk management system for defibrotide (Defitelio) in the treatment of severe 
hepatic veno-occlusive disease in haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation therapy in adults, 
adolescents, children and infants over 1 month of age is acceptable.  The following points should be 
taken into account in the next update.  
1.  The MAA decided to submit the RMP in the new format; however, not all aspects of the new 
format are entirely compliant with the guidelines. For instance, references are missing, 
description of the epidemiology is incomplete and Table V.3 is not in the correct format. This 
needs to be corrected. 
2.  Throughout the document, there are instances where frequency measures are provided as 
percentages and referred to as incidence rates. This is incorrect and needs to be amended. 
3.  Reference  throughout  the  RMP  to  measuring  the  impact  of  risk  minimisation  through 
‘monitoring of incidence reported from the market’ is insufficiently clear and this needs to 
be made more specific.  
Advice on conditions of the marketing authorisation  
The CHMP advises that the following should be conditions of the Marketing Authorisation: 
Risk management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency;  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 103/135 
 
  
  
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The CHMP considers that no additional risk minimisation measures will be necessary for the safe 
and effective use of the medicinal product. 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The CHMP recommends that a study to investigate all safety concerns identified in the RMP should 
be a condition of the MA. 
The CHMP recommends that this should take the form of a non-interventional (observational) 
study, namely a patient registry.

defibrotide when given 
intravenously and thus 
co-administration may present 
an increased risk of

Defibrotide has a profibrinolytic 
effect (see section 5.1) and this 
may potentially enhance the 
activity of 
antithrombotic/fibrinolytic 
medicinal products.  
At this time there is no reported 
experience in patients on the 
concomitant treatment with 
Low Molecular Weight Heparins 
(LMWHs), warfarin or the 
concomitant treatment with 
direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., 
dabigatran) or direct Factor Xa 
inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban 
and apixaban). Therefore, the 
use of defibrotide with 
antithrombotic/fibrinolytic 
medicinal products is not 
recommended.  
However, if used, in 
exceptional circumstances, 
caution should be exercised by

8.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD) is a serious pathology resulting from endothelial damage 
most commonly seen in the setting of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The precise 
pathogenesis of VOD is not fully elucidated but damage to the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium 
followed by thrombosis in the sinusoids leads to hepatic dysfunction, fluid retention and, if severe, 
can be associated with renal impairment and multi-organ failure. The diagnosis of VOD is very 
difficult as it requires exclusion of other pathologies seen often in the Haematopoietic Stem Cell 
Transplant (HSCT) setting such as infection and Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD). Another 
difficulty in the management of cases with VOD is when to give potentially toxic therapies (e.g. 
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) in an attempt to stop the microthrombosis in the liver. 
For aiding clinical decisions in these cases the Bearman model has been employed. This model takes 
into account the timing, degree and rate of rise in body weight and serum bilirubin levels. This 
prospectively validated prediction model applies to patients treated with cyclophosphamide and 
may not be applicable to patients treated with less toxic conditioning regimens. Using this model 
has been shown to have a high specificity, but only moderate sensitivity, for predicting those who 
will go on to develop severe VOD, which is defined as VOD with multi-organ failure. 
Currently the literature reports on both the incidence of and prognosis for VOD support the fact that 
for severe VOD the prognosis is poor with a high mortality rate. Currently there is no licensed 
therapy for this indication and the availability of an effective treatment for this patient group would 
be of great benefit. 
This application is for the treatment of severe hepatic VOD. In support of the claimed indication the 
applicant provided data from study 2005-01, an open-label phase II study including 102 patients 
with severe VOD/MOF showing a CR rate by Day 100 of 24% and a mortality rate by Day 100 of 
62%. Due to the uncontrolled nature of the study some type of external control is necessary as a 
control group of only 32 patients is too limited and cannot stand alone.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 125/135 
 
  
  
It is acknowledged that a placebo-controlled study is not feasible. Therefore, the CHMP’s view is 
that the results in the treatment group in terms of percentage of patients who have completed 
resolution of severe VOD by Day 100 post SCT and complete resolution of multi organ failure as well 
as survival rate Day 100 should either be evaluated on their own merits or compared with an 
adequate external historical control. In other words, since there are concerns about the nature of 
the HC group and running a controlled study in this indication is not possible, it is appropriate to 
consider additional sources of data that could support study control data provided by the Applicant.  
Registry data have been the major driver in the advances of allogeneic HSCT in the absence of 
randomised clinical trials (conditioning regimens, anti-GVHD prophylaxis and therapies, infection 
prophylaxis). There appears to be a treatment effect in severe VOD and the high mortality for 
severe VOD from the literature and the finally chosen historical control group suggest that DF is of 
use. The mortality of sVOD is reported to be in excess of 85% without DF treatment. 
The mortality of patients with severe VOD/MOF using supportive therapy without defibrotide has 
remained quite constant over two decades despite other therapeutic improvements for patients 
undergoing HSCT and the mortality rate of 62% compares favourably with the expected mortality 
rate of 75-85%. 
The US treatment-IND study (2006-05) is an open study treating patients with VOD. Results from 
this study also indicate a reduction in Day 100 mortality as compared to the expected 75-85%. 
The Applicant also provided additional data analysis from the US REGISTRY as an external 
comparator. In patients who were reported not to have received any specific interventions for their 
VOD, a mortality rate of 78% showed that despite any improvements in supportive care, the 
mortality rate remains very high with this disease. This US REGISTRY data could provide an 
estimate of the effect size that can be expected in the clinic under real life conditions. Day+100 
survival of patients treated with standard of care (SOC) plus defibrotide was 39% compared with 
31% for patients treated with SOC alone. VOD resolution occurred in 51% of the patients treated 
with SOC plus defibrotide compared with 29% of patients treated with SOC alone. 
Taking the most conservative comparison i.e., between the TG from study 2005-01 and the US 
REGISTRY non-defibrotide treated group, there is an absolute 7% benefit in favour of defibrotide, 
giving a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 14 to save one life. The data from the US REGISTRY 
substantiate the clinical benefit seen for defibrotide in the 2005-01 study. Taking all the data into 
consideration, the weight of the evidence suggest a survival benefit for defibrotide in the treatment 
of severe VOD. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The underlying MoA of defibrotide was claimed initially by the applicant as having multiple 
endothelial protective properties. Much of the older literature cites this as the MoA for defibrotide. 
The applicant has provided information on a cell protection assay and this remains to be confirmed 
in validation studies. The data are preliminary and it cannot be ascertained at this stage whether 
any activity seen is due to a pharmacological or physicochemical effect. The claimed cell-protection 
activities have not been sufficiently demonstrated. Further work to investigate and confirm these 
properties is needed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/824715/2012   
Page 126/135 
 
  
  
An updated expert statement provided by the applicant also claims a MoA for plasmin activation. 
The CHMP noted that a weak profibrinolytic effect has been shown and the MoA for Defibrotide is 
likely to be that of a weak fibrinolytic agent. The applicant has characterised defibrotide with several 
related profibrinolytic activity assays.  
The CHMP’ conclusions from the results of these assays is that the in vitro activity for fibrinolysis is 
weak and might even be seen as negligible when compared to negative controls and that the 
endothelial cell protection needs to be confirmed with more adequately designed studies.   
From a quality perspective, the activity of defibrotide in the profibrinolytic and endothelial cell 
protection assay is weak and possibly confounded by the signal: noise ratio. Defibrotide is 
polydisperse and difficult to characterise using physicochemical tests, and together with the 
inability to show strong biological activity in an in vitro assay, the quality, consistency and control 
of defibrotide rests significantly on robust control over the manufacturing process. In view of the 
limitations in defining defibrotide from a quality perspective, and as no clear clinical correlation to 
quality attributes has been demonstrated, this could lead to significant challenges in confirming the 
quality of the product over the lifecycle of this polydisperse product. In this regard, the Applicant 
has the obligation to provide the results of the validation of the SK-HEP-1 cell based assay as a a 
quality post-authorisation measures. Together with the results a proposal to include the assay as an 
additional routine Quality Control test for batch release and stability testing for both defibrotide 
active substance and finished product should be provided. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Although haemorrhagic complications were anticipated with defibrotide, it is difficult to ascribe with 
any degree of certainty AEs to the treatment itself in post-SCT patients, particularly those with 
VOD. The lack of a clear dose-response in AEs from the dose-finding study in the overall population 
also suggests that the unfavourable effects of DF cannot be characterised with certainty from the 
clinical data provided.  An exception is the statistically significant differences in Kaplan-Meier 
estimates for survival (68.2% Arm A 25mg/kg/day, versus 32.5% arm B 40mg/kg/day, p= 0.0259) 
in those under 16 years, and this remains unexplained but does raise concerns regarding safety in 
children at doses higher than the proposed posology (25 mg/kg/day). 
In terms of trying to assess the safety of defibrotide in VOD in the absence of a control group with 
adequate safety data, the largest safety database where different doses were administered to VOD 
patients is from DF-CUP and these results suggest a dose-related increase in bleeding. There were 
18 deaths in DF-CUP considered possibly, probably or definitely related to defibrotide – all these 
deaths were as a result of haemorrhage or in one case coagulopathy. 9 children and 9 adults died 
and of the 18 subjects only one was on the low dose of 10mg/kg/day, 4 subjects received between 
20-40mg/kg/day, 12 received 40mg/kg/day or higher, and for one subject the dose was not 
provided. Also of note is that in one case where defibrotide was stopped due to bleeding and then 
re-started again eleven days later, a further bleeding episode occurred within 5 days of 
re-commencement and DF was discontinued. Although the applicant states that there was no 
increase in efficacy with the 40mg/kg/day dose it does seem that for fatal bleeding events there was 
an association with higher doses.

Although no clear major signals for defibrotide related bleeding AEs across the clinical programme 
have been found, the relatedness of defibrotide to the signals seen cannot be clearly concluded in 
view of the lack of a concurrent control with VOD.   
The data from defibrotide use in the treatment indication does raise a signal for occasional allergic 
reactions, but no such signal was seen in the clinical trials provided in support of VOD. Interpreting 
the significance of the safety data is difficult as it is not clear when the applicant changed the animal 
and tissue source of defibrotide as the older literature reports refer to defibrotide as being of 
“mammalian origin” or derived from “bovine lung”. As the defibrotide in this application for the 
pivotal trial is from porcine intestine, this is not identical to the product previously marketed by the 
applicant. 
In summary, the unfavourable effects at present appear to be dose-related haemorrhage and 
increased toxicity (death) in children with the higher dose.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The finding of a dose-related increase in bleeding from DF-CUP is noted but in view of the open label 
nature of DF-CUP and the voluntary data provision by clinicians which is incomplete, firm 
conclusions cannot be drawn. 
There is only very limited data on PK of defibrotide in VOD. The lack of PK data in children and in 
those with renal failure, while both of these groups are included in the proposed indication of VOD, 
raises the level of uncertainly regarding the posology for children, in view of the safety signals at 
high doses, and in those with renal failure, as defibrotide is renally excreted and increased exposure 
will be expected in those with renal impairment. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Favourable effects from the uncontrolled treatment study have demonstrated an increase of the 
VOD resolution rate and reduction of the mortality rate. Taking all the data into consideration, the 
weight of the evidence suggest a survival benefit for defibrotide in the treatment of severe VOD. 
The unfavourable effects of defibrotide have not been clearly elucidated, although a dose-related 
increase in bleeding and increased mortality with higher exposure in children was seen. In addition 
effects such as those associated with prolonged infusions and the administration of an animal 
product carry additional risks including administration-associated AEs and allergic reactions to the 
product.   
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
For the treatment indication the applicant has provided data from a Phase III study including 102 
patients with severe VOD/MOF showing a CR rate by Day 100 of 24% and a mortality rate by Day 
100 of 62%. Due to the uncontrolled nature of the study some type of external control is necessary. 
However, a control group of only 32 patients is too limited and cannot stand alone. 
The benefits demonstrated from the treatment trial are considered reliable. For a single pivotal 
open label trial the use of a historical control group and the choice of that group have been clarified

by the applicant and the GCP findings do not seem to have an impact on the study results. The 
CHMP is of the opinion that the selection of the control group is sufficiently transparent and well 
explained by the Applicant. 
It is acknowledged that a placebo-controlled study is not feasible. Therefore, the CHMP’s view is 
that the results in the treatment group in terms of percentage of patients who have completed 
resolution of severe VOD by Day 100 post SCT and complete resolution of multi organ failure as well 
as survival rate Day 100 should either be evaluated on their own merits or compared with an 
adequate external historical control. In other words, since there are concerns about the nature of 
the HC group and running a controlled study in this indication is not possible, it is appropriate to 
consider additional sources of data that could support study control data provided by the Applicant.  
Registry data have been the major driver in the advances of allogeneic HSCT in the absence of 
randomised clinical trials (conditioning regimens, anti-GVHD prophylaxis and therapies, infection 
prophylaxis). There appears to be a treatment effect in severe VOD and the high mortality for 
severe VOD from the literature and the finally chosen historical control group suggest that DF is of 
use. The mortality of sVOD is reported to be in excess of 85% without DF treatment. 
The mortality of patients with severe VOD/MOF using supportive therapy without defibrotide has 
remained quite constant over two decades despite other therapeutic improvements for patients 
undergoing HSCT and that mortality rate of 62% compares favourably with the expected mortality 
rate of 75-85%.  
Considering all available information, the CHMP is of the opinion to grant Marketing Authorisation 
under exceptional circumstances and that in order to have additional data, prior to launch, the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall set up a patient registry to investigate the long term 
safety, health outcomes and patterns of utilisation of defibrotide during normal use.  It shall be a 
multi-centre, multinational and prospective observational disease registry of patients diagnosed 
with severe hepatic VOD following haematopoietic stem cell plantation (HSCT) and enroll patients 
treated with defibrotide, other treatments or supportive care. The MAH shall ensure that 
information regarding all safety concerns identified in the most recent version of the Risk 
Management Plan is being collected. The MAH shall also ensure that all health care professionals 
who might prescribe defibrotide are provided with information on the importance of, and how to 
enter patients in, the registry.   
The US treatment-IND study (2006-05) is an open study treating patients with VOD in the US. 
Results from this study also indicate a reduction in Day 100 mortality as compared to the expected 
75-85%. 
The Applicant also provided additional data analysis from the Centre for International Blood and 
Marrow Transplant Research (US REGISTRY) as an external comparator. In patients who were 
reported not to have received any specific interventions for their VOD, a mortality rate of 78% 
showed that despite any improvements in supportive care, the mortality rate remains very high 
with this disease. This US REGISTRY data could provide an estimate of the effect size that can be 
expected in the clinic under real life conditions. Day+100 survival of patients treated with standard 
of care (SOC) plus defibrotide was 39% compared with 31% for patients treated with SOC alone. 
VOD resolution occurred in 51% of the patients treated with SOC plus defibrotide compared with 
29% of patients treated with SOC alone.

Taking the most conservative comparison, i.e. between the TG from study 2005-01 and the US 
REGISTRY non-defibrotide treated group, there is an absolute 7% benefit in favour of defibrotide, 
giving a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 14 to save one life. The data from the US REGISTRY 
substantiate the clinical benefit seen for defibrotide in the 2005-01 study. Taking all the data into 
consideration, the weight of the evidence suggest a survival benefit for defibrotide in the treatment 
of severe VOD. 
The risks of defibrotide treatment are those associated with administration of prolonged frequent IV 
treatments and in addition the administration of an animal-derived product. In terms of clarification 
of the safety profile of DF, one of the proposed MoAs is a weak profibrinolytic effect and this raises 
concern about increased bleeding in a group where haemorrhage occurs frequently due to 
concomitant factors. Without a comparison between a defibrotide group and a placebo/physician’s 
choice group, AEs cannot be attributed clearly to the defibrotide in the setting of post-SCT patients 
with VOD.  
Additional risks are the lack of information on PK in children and in those with renal failure where in 
view of the trend for increased haemorrhages in higher dose patients in DF-CUP, together with 
increased deaths in children in the high dose group raise the need for further PK data in these 
groups. 
In conclusion, based on the totality of the data including the ongoing IND and the US REGISTRY 
data, the CHMP considered that sufficient evidence has been provided in support of the proposed 
revised treatment indication.   
Following the assessment of the detailed grounds for refusal provided by the applicant, the CHMP is 
of the view that the benefit risk balance of the above mentioned medicinal product can be 
considered positive in the proposed treatment indication on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
The HC group cannot stand alone but it is accepted that even recent registry data indicate that 
patients who do not receive defibrotide still have a very high mortality rate; 
The US treatment IND- study (2006-05) although uncontrolled indicate a beneficial effect on 
mortality of defibrotide; 
The US REGISTRY data support that defibrotide increases the VOD resolution rate and reduces 
the mortality rate; 
•  External control data is the only possible comparison. 
Furthermore, the CHMP is of the opinion that a comprehensive clinical data package in the above 
indication cannot reasonably be expected to be provided, as the disease is very rare and a placebo 
controlled designed study impossible to conduct. Therefore, the CHMP recommends the granting of 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances, with the condition that a registry is put in 
place to continuously collect safety and efficacy data to be reported annually.  
The CHMP is of the view that the risk management system for Defitelio in the treatment of severe 
hepatic veno-occlusive disease is acceptable.  Routine risk minimisation measures are considered 
sufficient for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. Further, the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to further identify and 
characterise the risks of the product.

9.  Recommendations following re-examination 
Based on the arguments of the applicant and all the supporting data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion concluded by majority decision that 
the risk-benefit balance of Defitelio in the treatment of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease 
(VOD), also known as sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS), in haematopoietic stem-cell 
transplantation therapy (HSCT) is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances subject to the following conditions:

Divergent Positions 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the 
granting of a Marketing Authorisation for Defitelio. 
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
The pivotal study supporting the indication consists in a comparison between 102 patients treated 
with Defitelio for VOD with an historical control arm composed by 32 patients suffering from VOD. 
The study is formally a failure as it did not meet its pre-planned level of significance, which was set 
at 1%. The control arm has been repetitively altered leading to the exclusion of 54 patients initially 
included. It cannot be excluded that has led to bias. Moreover the robustness of the results is 
questioned. 
Finally, external support obtained from ongoing studies such as the US REGISTRY is of limited value 
as individual patient based data is not yet available to the MAA for a critical review and in-depth 
assessment by the CHMP. 
Taking into account these elements, the benefit/risk of defibrotide in the treatment and prevention 
of VOD is not established.

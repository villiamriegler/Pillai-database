1.1. 
Introduction 
Neupro (rotigotine) is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic 
Parkinson’s disease.  
Parkinson’s  disease  (PD)  is  a  neurodegenerative  disorder  characterized  by  a  progressive  loss  of 
dopaminergic  neurons  in  the  substantia  nigra.  Parkinson's  disease  is  clinically  characterised  by 
bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and postural reflex impairment. The cause of Parkinson's disease 
is,  at  present  time,  unknown.  Parkinson's  disease  is  a  slowly  progressive  disease.  Pharmacological 
intervention  of  Parkinson's  disease  is  symptomatic.  Improvement  of  an  impaired  dopaminergic 
neurotransmission  is  the  backbone  of  therapy.  About  70%  of  patients  with  PD  will  require 
symptomatic  therapy  within  2  years  of  disease  onset.  The  choice  between  levodopa+decarboxylase 
inhibitor  or  a  dopamine-agonist  for  initial  therapy  remains  controversial.  On  the  one  hand 
levodopa+decarboxylase  inhibitor  is  more  effective  and  better  tolerated  than  dopamine-agonists,  on 
the other hand there are concerns that it might be toxic to dopaminergic neurons and that it promotes 
the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. 
Rotigotine  (Neupro)  belongs  to  the  group  of  non-ergolinic  dopamine  agonists  and  shows  a  close 
structural analogy to dopamine and apomorphine. The currently approved formulations are presented 
as  10  cm2,  20  cm2,  30 cm2
  transdermal  patches  containing  respectively  4.5  mg,  9.0  mg, 
13.5 mg and 18.0 mg of rotigotine, and designed to release respectively 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg and 8 mg of 
rotigotine per 24 hours. 
  and  40  cm2
The variation refers to an extension of the therapeutic indication to include ‘the treatment of the signs 
and symptoms of advanced idiopathic Parkinson’s disease in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the 
course  of  the  disease,  through  to  late  stages  when  the  effect  of  levodopa  wears  off  or  becomes 
inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or ‘on-off’ fluctuations).’ 
Consequential changes were made to relevant sections of the Summary Product Characteristics (SPC). 
The  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  was  updated  accordingly.    In  addition,  contact  details  of  Bulgaria  and 
Romania local representatives were also included. 
1.2.  Non clinical aspects 
The  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  results  from  animal  studies,  supportive  of  the  approved 
formulations have been previously assessed at the time of the initial application for Neupro. The dose 
of  18  mg  (40  cm2  patch  size,  i.e  8  mg/24h),  maximum  therapeutic  dose  observed  for  the  currently 
approved indication, was used as basis to calculate the safety margins of rotigotine. 
This  variation  application  concerns  an  extension  of  indication  to  include  the  treatment  of  signs  and 
symptoms  of  advanced  stage  Parkinson  patients  in  combination  with  levodopa.  The  proposed 
maximum therapeutic dose is 36 mg (i.e 16 mg/24h) and has been used in the pivotal clinical study 
SP515, conducted in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. 
Within  this  variation  application,  the  MAH  has  therefore  proposed  to  update  the  calculation  of  the 
safety margins and revise the product information accordingly. 
The  toxicological  safety  margins  were  calculated  for  the  maximum  human  dose  of  36  mg  for  the 
treatment  of  advanced  stage  of  Parkinson’s  disease  based  on  the  mean  maximum  plasma  levels  in 
patients , achieved during the maintenance phase (i.e. 6.71 ng/mL).

Safety ratios at No-Observed-Effect Levels (NOELs) 
Table 1: Safety ratios at NOELs 
*AUC (daily) is not available; therefore calculation has not been made 
At  doses  above  the  NOEL,  the  most  prominent  systemic  effects,  such  as  restlessness  and  effects  on 
food/water  consumption  and  body  weight  ,  are  mainly  related  to  the  pharmacodynamic,  dopamine 
agonistic  effects  in  healthy  animals  and/or  the  well-known  influence  of  dopamine  agonists  on  sex 
hormone (e.g. prolactin) secretion.  
Safety ratios at Well Tolerated Dose Levels (WTDLs) 
Well  tolerated  dose  levels  (WTDLs)  were  defined  by  the  MAH  as  to  show:  no  substance-related 
deaths;  no  findings  which  are  not  related  to  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  rotigotine;  no 
irreversible rotigotine-related effects.

Given  the  results  provided  by  the  long-term  pivotal repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  which  were  mainly 
related to pharmacodynamic, dopamine agonistic related-effects, the use of the WTDL is interesting 
and may reflect a more realistic estimation of the safety margins.  
Overall, rotigotine did not result in any target organ toxicity. With respect to the toxicological data and 
relevant non-clinical findings, the CHMP concluded that the safety ratios compared to the maximum 
intended dose in advanced Parkinsonian patients (36 mg) were acceptable. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
The clinical development program to support the extension of indication of Neupro to advanced-stage 
Parkinson’s disease included 3 placebo-controlled studies: 
- 
- 
1 phase II study (SP511) was conducted in patients with advanced stage Parkinson’s disease and 
evaluated dose-response with the following patches: 9 mg/20 cm2, 18mg /40 cm2 and 27mg /60 
cm2. 
2 pivotal phase III studies (SP650 and SP515) , were conducted in patients with advanced-stage 
Parkinson’s  disease.  Both  clinical  studies  were  multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind  and 
parallel group design, consisting of a titration period in which the patients were titrated to their 
optimal dose or up to a maximum dose, followed by a maintenance and de-escalation periods. In 
study  SP515,  treatment  arm  included  pramixepole,  as  an  active  control  and  the  patients  were 
receiving doses up to 36 mg (i.e 16 mg/24h). 
Additional  phase  II/IIIb  open-label  studies  were  conducted  and  mainly  evaluated  the  safety  and 
tolerability of rotigotine in patients with advanced stage Parkinson’s disease. Particularly, two phase 
IIIb  studies  were  performed,  respectively,  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  overnight  switching  from  
ropinirole,  pramipexole,  or  cabergoline  to  rotigotine  (SP824)  and  the  effect  of  rotigotine  on  early 
morning motor impairment and sleep disorders (SP826).  
Clinical Efficacy 
• 
Dose-Response Study  
Study SP511 
METHODS 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this phase II study was to determine the dose group of rotigotine patch that 
shows efficacy with optimal benefit/risk ratio in subjects with advanced-stage, idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease.  
Design  
SP511  was  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  parallel  study  with  4  arms  respectively 
placebo, rotigotine at 9mg (20 cm2), 18 mg (40cm2) and 27mg (60cm2). 
Study Participants  
Subjects  with  idiopathic  Parkinson’s  disease  who  were  required  to  exhibit  the  cardinal  sign  of 
bradykinesia and at least 1 of the additional signs of advanced-stage disease: resting tremor, rigidity, 
and/or impairment of postural reflexes. Furthermore, these subjects were not adequately controlled on 
the levodopa dose (in combination with benserazide or carbidopa), which was judged by the treating  
Page 4 of 21                                                                       ©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
physician to be optimal. At Baseline, subjects had motor fluctuations with diary confirmation that at 
least  2.5  hours/day  were  spent  in  the  ‘off’  state.  Subjects  with  unpredictable  ‘on’/’off’  fluctuations 
were excluded from the trial. 
Treatment study arms  
In  study  SP511,  the  target  doses  selected  in  patients  with  advanced-stage  Parkinson’s  disease  were 
9.0mg  (20cm2),  18.0mg  (40cm2),  and  27mg(60cm2)  rotigotine.  The  subjects  were  titrated  to  their 
target doses in weekly increments of 4.5mg (10cm2), starting at 9.0mg/day (20cm2). 
Back-titration  could  be  performed  once  during  the  entire  titration  period.  Once  a  back  titration  was 
performed, the patient was maintained at the back titrated dose for the remainder of the study period. 
If  another  dose  reduction  was  necessary,  the  subject  was  withdrawn  from  the  study.  Different 
combinations of 4 patches (including placebo, 4.5mg, and 9.0mg patches) were used to titrate subjects 
weekly  for  5  weeks  to  their  target  doses.  Patients  randomised  to  9mg  (20cm2)  and  18.mg  (40cm2) 
received  placebo  patches  for  4  and  2  weeks,  respectively.  Patients  in  each  treatment  group  were 
maintained  on  the  target  dose  for  7  weeks.  The  maximum  treatment  exposure  to  rotigotine  was  3 
months. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary variable was the absolute change from baseline to end of treatment in absolute time spent 
‘off’. 
RESULTS 
A total of 324 subjects were randomised to treatment: 84 to placebo and 240 to rotigotine (of which 2 
discontinued  the  trial  prior  to  receiving  randomised  medication).  Of  the  238  remaining  subjects 
randomised to rotigotine, 15 never received rotigotine because of sham back titrations.  
The different treatment groups were well balanced with respect to age, sex, body weight, ethnic origin, 
and  duration  of  disease  (range  of  7.3  to  7.9  years).  At  baseline,  the  absolute  time  spent  “off”  was 
similar across treatment groups (range 5.97 – 6.47 hours). The baseline UPDRS (Unified Parkinson’s 
Disease Rating Scale) scores (I, II, and III) were well balanced between treatment groups. In addition, 
subject’s  distribution  using  Hoehn  &  Yahr  staging,  levodopa  use  at  baseline,  and  agreement  for 
training of subjects for completion of subject’s diaries were well balanced between treatment groups.

Main studies 
Studies SP650 and SP515 
METHODS 
Objectives 
The  objectives  of  the  2  phase  III  studies  (SP650  and  SP515)  were  to  evaluate  efficacy,  safety  and 
tolerability  of  rotigotine  transdermal  patch  as  adjuvant  to  levodopa  in  advanced  idiopathic  
Parkinson’s disease as compared to placebo and  active control i.e. pramipexole (only SP515). 
Study Design  
Studies SP650 and SP515 had a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel study design.  
Study Participants  
Subjects  with  advanced  idiopathic  Parkinson’s  Disease,  who  experienced  wearing-off  type  motor 
fluctuations on levodopa. 
Subjects were included if they had been diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease of >3 years in 
duration, had a Hoehn & Yahr stage II through IV as observed in both the ‘on’ and ‘off” state, were on 
a stable dose of levodopa of at least 200 mg/day (SP650) or 300 mg/day (SP515) for at least 28 days 
prior  to  baseline,  were  not  adequately  controlled  on  anti-Parkinson  medication  as  judged  by  the 
treating investigator to be optimal, had an average of 2.5 hours/day or more spent in the ‘off’ state at 
screening; were on a stable dose of all anti-Parkinsonian medications at least 28 days prior to baseline. 
For the duration of the trial the concurrent anti-Parkinson medication allowed, had to remain stable.  
Main exclusion criteria were patients with a history of surgical interventions for Parkinson’s disease, 
serious  concurrent  co-morbidity,  QTc  interval  abnormalities,  orthostatic  hypotension  and  history  of 
skin sensitivity to adhesives.

Treatment study arms  
Procedure  
The  run-in  period  was  approximately  28  days.  The  subsequent  dose  escalation  phase  was  5  weeks 
(SP650) or 7 weeks (SP515).  
In study SP650, patients were titrated up to the target dose (18 or 27 mg/day) or maximum tolerated 
doses.  
In  study  SP515,  patients  were  titrated  up  to  the  optimal  dose,  tolerated  dose  or  maximum  dose 
(36mg/day). 
The  maintenance  phase  lasted  24  weeks  (SP650)  or  16  weeks  (SP515).  In  the  maintenance  phase, 
patients remained on the optimal doses determined. During the first 2 weeks of the maintenance phase 
L-dopa could be reduced.  At the end of the maintenance phase a blinded de-escalation over 8 days 
(SP650) or 6 days (SP515) days followed.  
Doses 
In study SP650, subjects were randomised to rotigotine transdermal patch 18  mg/day, 27 mg/day or 
placebo. All patients received  two  10 cm2 patches (placebo patch  or  4.5 mg rotigotine ) and  two 20 
cm2 patches (placebo or 9.0 mg rotigotine).  
Based on the targeted daily dose, the titration schedule is presented in the following table:

Concomitant treatment 
Subjects  had  to  be  on  a  stable  dose  of  levodopa defined  as  no  change  in  total daily  dose  and  in  the 
treatment  regimen  for  at  least  28  days  prior  to  baseline.  Subjects  were  not  permitted  to  adjust  their 
daily  dose  of  L-DOPA  at  any  time  during  the  course  of  the  trial.  In  case  of  adverse  events  due  to 
excessive dopaminergic stimulation, the physician could reduce the L-DOPA dose but only in the first 
2 weeks of the maintenance phase. Thereafter the dose had to remain stable.  
Concurrent medication acting on the dopaminergic system other than levodopa was not allowed. Other 
anti-Parkinson's drugs and/or CNS active drugs were allowed, provided the dose was stable and kept 
stable  during  the  trial.  In  study  SP650,  COMT-inhibitors  were  not  allowed  whereas  in  study  SP515 
entacapone was allowed. 
Efficacy endpoints 
Subjects  recorded  the  time  spent  ‘off’,  ‘on  without  troublesome  dyskinesias’,  ‘on  with  troublesome 
dyskinesias”,  sleep,  and  time  of  anti-Parkinson  medication.  Before  study  entry,  subjects  were 
intensively trained to recognise these motor stages and how to complete their diaries. Three diaries had 
to be completed for 3 consecutive days prior to the next visit. A diary was considered valid if at least 
22 of the 24 hours data were completed. Less than 2 valid diaries out of 3 was considered missing. 
According  to  different  regulatory  recommendations,  the  primary  endpoint  was  defined  differently  in 
Europe (EU) and the United States (US).  
In the EU, the primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of responder at the end of treatment. A 
responder was defined as a subject with a ≥ 30% decrease in absolute time spent ‘off’. In the US, the 
primary  efficacy  parameter  was  the  absolute  reduction  in  absolute  time  spent  ‘off’  at  the  end  of 
treatment.

Secondary  outcomes  variables  notably  included  on/off  time  based  variables,  absolute  change  in  on 
stage  of  UPDRS  II  (ADL),  UPDRS  III  (Motor  score)  and  UPDRS  IV  (impairment),  Parkinson’s 
Disease Questionnaire (SP515 only), EuroQoL (SP650 only) and clinical global impression.   
Sample size 
Study SP560 
Assuming  the  true  proportions  of  responders  is  60%  and  40%  for  active  treatment  and  placebo 
respectively,  a    sample  size  of  110  subjects  in  each  treatment  arm  was  needed  to  detect  such 
difference, (α=0.05, 1-β=0.80).  
Study SP515   
The sample size was determined by the active comparison of rotigotine to pramipexole.  
Assuming a true responders rate of 50% for both active treatment arms, 180 subjects per active arm 
was needed to ensure that the lower bound of the two sided CI95% does not exceed the non-inferiority 
margin of 15% (1-β=0.80).  
For  the  absolute  reduction  in  absolute  time  spent  ‘off’  at  the  end  of  treatment,  sample  size  was 
calculated on the analysis as performed for the EU. For the comparison to placebo, the expected 20% 
difference  as  given  in  the  responder  endpoint  corresponded  to  1.5  hours  reduction  in  absolute  ‘off’ 
time  (power  >  0.95,  SD  2.48).    For  the  active  comparison  the  15%  non-inferiority  margin 
corresponded to a reduction in absolute ‘off’ time of approximately 1.2 hours (power > 0.95).   
Assuming a difference in responder’s rate with placebo of 20%, 90 subjects are needed in the placebo 
arm  to  establish  a  statistical  significant  difference,  if  it  exists  (2-sided  normal  approximation  test, 
α=0.05, 1-β=0.85, 2:2:1 randomization ratio).  
Statistical methods 
No interim analyses or data monitoring board meetings were conducted.  
The responder status was analyzed using large sample normal approximation. The analysis of absolute 
change  in  ‘off’  time  was  evaluated  by  means  of  an  ANCOVA  (analysis  of  covariance)  model  with 
treatment as main effect and geographic region and baseline absolute time spent ‘off’ as covariates. 
The  primary analysis  concerned  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS).  The  Full  Analysis  Set  incorporates  all 
randomized patients receiving trial medication and with a valid baseline visit (4 valid diary cards out 
of 6) and at least 1 valid post-baseline visit (2 valid diary cards out of 3). For non-inferiority testing 
(SP650) the FAS data set was also the primary analyses set. 
In study SP650, the first comparison was between rotigotine 27 mg/day and placebo (α=0.025 1-sided) 
for  superiority  of  rotigotine  responder  rate  to  the  placebo  responder  rate.  If  significant,  the  second 
comparison was between rotigotine 18 mg/day versus placebo (α=0.025 1-sided).  
In  study  SP515,  the  first  comparison  was  between  placebo  and  rotigotine  (α=0.05  2-sided)  for 
superiority  of  rotigotine  responder  rate  to  the  placebo  responder  rate.  If  significant,  the  second 
comparison  was  between  rotigotine  and  pramipexole  for  non-inferiority  (α=0.025  1-sided),  if  non-
inferior  and  the  corresponding  confidence  interval  (CI)  lied  above  0,  then  a  2-sided  p-value  for 
superiority of rotigotine to pramipexole was to be calculated. 
Secondary variables were presented using descriptive statistics only. 
Missing values 
Only data from valid visits were used for analyses. A daily diary card was regarded to be valid if at 
least 22 hours of the 24 hour clock were filled in. The missing hours were imputed according to the 
proportions ‘on/off’ of the observed hours. Further, a visit was regarded only valid if for the baseline

visit at least 4 diary cards out of the 6 were valid and for the post-baseline visits at least 2 diary cards 
out of 3 were valid. For missing data the last observation carried forward was used.

Two phase IIIb studies were provided, respectively, to evaluate the effect of overnight switching from  
ropinirole,  pramipexole,  or  cabergoline  to  rotigotine  (SP824)  and  the  effect  of  rotigotine  on  early 
morning motor impairment and sleep disorders (SP826).  
In  study  SP824,  subjects  switched  from  an  oral  dopamine  agonist  to  rotigotine  transdermal 
experienced no loss of efficacy or increase in sleeps impairment. 
In study SP826, treatment with transdermal rotigotine improved early morning motor impairment and 
sleep  disorders  in  subjects  who  were  diagnosed  with  idiopathic  Parkinson’s  disease  and  who  were 
titrated  to  an  optimal  dose  of  rotigotine  up  to  36mg/day.  In  addition,  the  CGI  (Clinical  Global 
Impression), PGI (Patient Global Impression), and PDQ-8 (Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire, short 
form)  showed  consistent  improvement.  An  improved  control  of  motor  performance  as  supported  by 
improvements  in  tapping  Rates,  UPDRS  Part  III  Score,  nocturnal  akinesia  score,  and  the  standing-
walking-turning test was observed. An improved control of sleep disorders was observed as supported 
by  a  decreased  nocturnal  akinesia,  decreased  nocturnal  dystonia,  decreased  nocturnal  cramps,  fewer 
nocturias,  an  improved  sleep  and  nocturnal  disability  score  and  an  improved  sleep  without  daytime 
somnolence.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical  development  program of rotigotine, proposed by the applicant  to extend the therapeutic 
indication  to  advanced  stage  Parkinson’s  disease  is  in  accordance  with  the  Note  for  Guidance  on 
Clinical 
treatment  of  Parkinson’s  disease 
(CPMP/EWP/563/95).

The  design  and  conduct  of  the  pivotal  studies  did  not  raise  critical  issues.  Especially  the  complex 
double-dummy  schedule  applied  in  both  pivotal  studies  was  quite  challenging.  Furthermore,  the 
management of concomitant medication was as expected in those studies performed in patients with 
advanced  Parkinson’s  disease.  One  point  of  criticism  is  the  predefined  non-inferiority  margin  in  the 
active  controlled  study  (SP515).  The  predefined  non-inferiority  margin  is  questionable  since  in  the 
worse case scenario as a loss of effect of 50% would in principle have been accepted.  
Rotigotine  was  effective  in  reducing  ‘off’  time  as  compared  to  placebo,  irrespective  of  whether  this 
was  expressed  in  terms  of  responders,  defined  as  a  subject  with  a  ≥  30%  decrease  in  absolute  time 
spent ‘off’, or absolute change in ‘off’ time.   
In  study  SP650,  responder  rates  were  55%,  57%  and  34%  for  rotigotine  27  mg/day,  rotigotine  18 
mg/day and placebo respectively. The ‘off’ time decreased from baseline by 2.1, 2.7 and 0.9 hours for 
rotigotine 27 mg/day, rotigotine 18 mg/day and placebo respectively.   
In  study  SP515,  responder  rates  were  67%,  60%  and  35%  for  pramipexole,  rotigotine  and  placebo 
respectively.  The  ‘off’  time  decreased  by  2.5,  2.8  and  0.9  hours  for  rotigotine,  pramipexole  and 
placebo respectively.  
Differences  with  placebo  were  all  highly  significant  and  a  reduction  in  ‘off’  time  of  2  hours  as 
compared to placebo was clinically relevant.  
Nevertheless, non inferiority has not been demonstrated even wih a predefined non-inferiority margin 
considered to be set too high. The lower limit of the confidence interval of the difference in responder 
rates exceeded the non-inferiority margin of 15% (CI95%: -16.7%; 2.1%). In contrast, the confidence 
interval of the difference in the absolute change in the ‘off’ time between rotigotine and pramipexole 
was  within  the  predefined  non-inferiority  margin  i.e.  1.2  hrs  (CI95%  :  -0.91;  0.21).  Although  these 
results appeared controversial, a clinical benefit of rotigotine in the ‘on’ time without dyskinesia was 
also observed, as compared to pramipexole. 
With  respect  to  the  open  label  and  uncontrolled  studies  SP824  and  SP826,  results  do  not  allow  any 
conclusions concerning the overall efficacy of rotigotine and efficacy variables such as improvement 
in sleep (as measured by the Parkinson’s disease sleep scale or PDSS, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
or ESS). The limitation of these efficacy results was acknowledged by the MAH as only descriptive 
statistics were presented.  
Overall,  the  efficacy  results  from  the  clinical  development  program  of  Neupro  are  supportive  of  the 
applied  extension  of  indication  to  include  the  treatment  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  advanced 
idiopathic  Parkinson’s  disease  in  combination  with  levodopa,  i.e.  over  the  course  of  the  disease, 
through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations 
of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or ‘on-off’ fluctuations). 
Clinical Safety 
All  subjects  receiving  at  least  1  dose  of  trial  medication  (rotigotine  silicone  patch  formulation, 
pramipexole, or placebo) were included in the safety analyses.  
The safety results presented mainly concern the primary analysis set, i.e. all subjects from the pivotal 
studies SP650 and SP515. 
Safety variables included the occurrence of adverse events, changes in vital signs, body weight, ECGs, 
clinical  laboratory  values,  physical  and  neurological  examination,  Epworth  Sleepiness  Scale  scores 
and Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (SP515 only).

Set AS1 primary analysis set, included all subjects in the double blind of the pivotal studies i.e. studies SP650 and SP515.  
Set  AS2  included  all  subjects  with  advanced-stage  Parkinson’s  diseases  in    the  phase  2/3  trials  excluding  the  open-label 
extension data i.e. studies SP533, SP591, SP824, SP826, SP511, SP515 and SP650.  
Set AS3 is an extension of AS2 included the open-label data as well. 
Set AS4 includes all subjects with advanced-stage Parkinson’s disease treated in the pivotal studies and treat at least once in 
the open-label extension: SP515 + SP516 and SP650DB + SP650OL. 
Set AS5 included the same subjects as in set AS4, but only the open-label data were used.

Adverse events (AEs) 
Aside from those events that are associated with the method of administration (i.e. use of transdermal 
patch), the reported AEs mainly concern those generally considered as class-related and well-known 
pharmacodynamic  effects  of  dopamine  agonists.  Of  importance,  no  dose  relationship  was  observed 
between rotigotine dose and the occurrence of the AEs.

The rates of AEs for rotigotine and pramipexole are comparable. Any differences in numerical values 
are probably due to random variation.

Deaths and other serious adverse events 
There  were  20  reports  of  deaths.  These  concerned  patients  who  received  rotigotine  (n=16),  placebo 
(n=3) and no medication (n=1, the death occurred during the run-in period). The reported deaths under 
medication were not considered related to study treatment. The causes of death under rotigotine were: 
cerebrovascular  accident  (n=3),  myocardial  infarction  (n=2),  pneumonia  (n=2),  completed  suicide 
(n=2),  cardiac  disorder(n=1),  renal  cancer  metastatic(n=1),  unexplained  death(n=1),  road  traffic 
accident(n=1), bronchial carcinoma(n=1), intestinal obstruction (n=1) and pulmonary embolism(n=1). 
Forty-six  (9%),  33  (9%)  and  16  (7.4%)  serious  AEs  were  reported  in  the  rotigotine,  placebo  and 
pramipexole groups, respectively.

Serious  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  related  to  rotigotine    medication  included:  myocardial 
ischemia  (0.2%),  atrial  fibrillation  (0.2%),  supraventricular  tachycardia  (0.2%),  nausea  (0.2%), 
application  and  instillation  site  reactions  (0.5%),  application  site  dermatitis  (0.5%),    Oedema 
peripheral  (0.2%),  cellulitis  (0.2%),  fall  (0.2%),  dyskinesia  (0.2%),  vasovagal  syncope  (0.2%),    and 
sleep attacks (0.2%). No serious adverse events were reported with respect to hallucination, psychosis, 
paranoid reaction, or somnolence. 
• 
Other safety findings 
Among all rotigotine-treated subjects there were 514 application and instillation site reactions reported 
by 334 out of 1151 subjects (29%).  
Oedema  was  reported  in  1%  of  placebo-treated  subjects  and  9%  of  rotigotine-treated.  Two  subjects 
(<1%)  in  the  rotigotine  group  had  severe  peripheral  oedema,  one  case  was  reported  as  serious  and 
resulted  in  discontinuation  of  treatment.  Three  additional  rotigotine-treated  subjects  (<1%  total) 
discontinued treatment as a result of peripheral oedema.  
The rate of oedema was higher in study SP650 (placebo<1%, rotigotine=13%) as compared to study 
SP515 (placebo=2%, rotigotine=4%, pramipexole=3%). 
In clinical studies, the 6 month-specific rates of peripheral oedema remained at about 4% through the 
entire observation period up to 36 months. 
• 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse  events  lead  to  discontinuation  in  8%  of  the  placebo-treated  subjects  and  13%  of  the 
rotigotine-treated subjects.  
Adverse  event  terms  that  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  >1%  of  rotigotine-treated  subjects  included 
nausea (4%), vomiting (2%), and application and instillation site reactions (2%). Peripheral Oedema 
lead to discontinuation in the Rotigotine group (0.9%). 
Dose  reduction  due  to  AE  occurred  in  3%  of  subjects  receiving  placebo  and  in  5%  of  subjects 
receiving  rotigotine.  In  the  rotigotine  group,  the  most  frequent  AE  leading  to  dose  reduction  was 
dyskinesia (3%). 
• 
Discussion on Clinical Safety 
The  safety  profile  of  rotigotine  in  advanced  Parkinson's  disease  is  similar  to  the  one  observed  for  a 
dopamine-agonistic  agent.  Although  the  rotigotine  doses  were  higher  in  this  patient  population,  no 
dose-response  relationship  with  respect  to  AEs  was  present.  In  addition,  an  increased  frequency  of 
AEs was observed as compared to monotherapy.  
In  studies  SP650  and  SP515,  high  incidence  of  application  site  reactions  (31%)  has  been  observed. 
Although these AEs may counteract the convenience gained by the once dosing schedule, they have 
similarly been reported in the monotherapy studies and therefore did not raise any new concern. Most 
application and instillation site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, and most had resolved by 
the end of double-blind treatment. The incidence of these AEs did not appear to be dose dependent.  
Safety  analysis  of  specific  issues  such  as  cardiac  arrythmias,  eye  disorders,  severe  application  site 
reactions,  oedema,  orthostatic  hypotension,  dyskinesias,  sleep  attacks,  compulsive  behaviour,  and 
potential  for  QT  prolongation  were  performed  in  patients  with  advanced  stage  Parkinson’s  disease 
from those clinical studies. No concerns were raised. In clinical studies, the 6 month-specific rates of 
peripheral oedema remained at about 4% through the entire observation period up to 36 months.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
1.5  Overall Conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit-risk  for 
Neupro  transdermal  patches  indicated  in  ‘the  treatment  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  advanced 
idiopathic  Parkinson’s  disease  in  combination  with  levodopa,  i.e.  over  the  course  of  the  disease, 
through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations 
of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or ‘on-off’ fluctuations)’, is favourable and recommended 
the variation to the marketing authorisation. 
A  revised  risk  management  plan  was  submitted.  The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted, 
was of the opinion that: 
-  
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.

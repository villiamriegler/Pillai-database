1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Sanofi-aventis Deutschland GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 25 
April 2014 an extension of the existing marketing authorisation of Optisulin to register an additional 
form 300 units/ml grouped with a Type IAIN variation to change the invented name from Optisulin 
to Toujeo.  
The  applicant  applied  for  an  addition  of  a  new  strength/potency  (300  units/ml),  grouped  with  a 
change in the (invented) name of the medicinal product (Toujeo). The applicant applied initially for 
the following indication for the new strength/potency: Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, point (c) - Extensions of marketing authorisations 
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Background 
Diabetes  mellitus  is  a  chronic  disease  characterized  by  hyperglycaemia  from  defects  in  insulin 
secretion, insulin action, or both.   
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) usually begins at a young age (<20 years) and is mainly due to 
autoimmune  destruction  of  the  pancreatic  ß-cells  that  produce  insulin.  As  a  result,  patients    with 
T1DM require lifelong insulin supplementation for survival.  
In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),, the most common form of diabetes accounting for over 90% of 
all diabetes cases , the combined impact of impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance results in 
elevated blood glucose (BG) levels. Due to the latter, hyperglycaemia may prevail despite plasma 
insulin  levels  exceeding  those  in  non-diabetic  individuals.  Treatment  initially  involves  changes  in 
lifestyle (diet, exercise), with oral antihyperglycaemic drugs (OADs) added as necessary to maintain 
adequate BG control. Other injectable therapeutic agents, such as the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
receptor agonists may be an option before or in addition to insulin in some patients. Ultimately, due 
to  the  progressive  β-cell  failure  in  T2DM,  insulin  replacement  is  indicated  in  patients  to  manage 
hyperglycaemia. As many patients with T2DM maintain some residual endogenous insulin secretion, 
the insulin treatment regimen in T2DM may be less complex than in T1DM . 
It has been established in T1DM and T2DM that uncontrolled, high levels of BG are a factor for chronic 
microvascular  and  macrovascular  complications  that  can  result  in  retinopathy,  nephropathy, 
neuropathy  and  premature  cardiovascular  (CV)  morbidity  and  mortality.  Studies  have  shown  that 
improving the control of BG levels in both T1DM , and T2DM  reduces the risk of these complications.  
About the product 
Insulin is the most effective available glucose-lowering treatment. Insulin preparations differing both 
in  their  time  of  onset  and  duration  of  action  are  available  for  insulin  substitution  therapy.  Of the 
different  therapeutic  options,  basal-bolus  regimens  try  to  closely  mimic  physiological  insulin 
concentrations by injections of long-acting insulin products for basal insulin supply (comprising insulin 
glargine,  insulin  detemir,  degludec      or  human  insulin  [neutral  protamine  Hagedorn-insulin; 
NPH-insulin])  and  premeal  (bolus)  injections  of  short-  or  short-  and  rapid-acting  insulin  products 
(comprising  human  insulin  or  human  insulin  analogues  aspart,  lispro  or  glulisine).  The  combined 
time-action profiles of the basal insulin dose(s) and the short-acting insulin products are to match 
fasting  and  prandial  glucose  load;  inappropriately  high  or  low  insulin  levels  may  lead  to 
hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.  
Insulin glargine is a recombinant analogue of human insulin. 
Toujeo (Insulin glargine 300 U/mL, HOE901-U300 in this document: U300).) is indicated in diabetes 
mellitus  where  treatment  with  insulin  is  required.  U300  has  the  same  composition  as  Lantus  and 
Optisulin, which were the commercial formulations of insulin glargine 100 U/mL available when the 
studies included in this dossier were performed, except for adjustment of 3 times the amount of active 
pharmaceutical ingredient and corresponding zinc content. 
Insulin  glargine  as  Lantus  [EMEA/H/C/000284]  and  Optisulin  [EMEA/H/C/000309]  has  been 
authorised  in  the  EU  since  June  2006.  The  efficacy  and  safety  of  insulin  glargine  are  well  known 
through  extensive  data  collection  involving  over  200  000  patients  included  in  clinical  trials  and 
observational studies.

In  the  subsequent  text  insulin  glargine  100  U/mL  is  also  referred  to  as  U100  or  as  Lantus  (a 
commercial  formulation  of  insulin  glargine  100  U/mL  available  when  the  studies  included  in  this 
dossier were performed).  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The U300 pen injector is a multiple-dose, disposable insulin pen injection system for single patient use. 
Insulin  glargine  is  available  as  solution  for  injection  containing  10.91  mg/mL  insulin  glargine 
[equivalent  to  300  U  (units)  of  insulin  glargine/mL].  The  finished  product  is  to  be  administered 
subcutaneously. The total content of the 1.5 ml cartridge is 450 insulin units. The injection system 
provides a maximum of 80 units in one dosing. The dose for injection is adjusted in 1U increments. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Insulin glargine, is a known active substance used for the approved solution for injection containing 
100 U/mL. No further data was provided regarding the active substance for this line extension 
application as the active substance has been approved for manufacturing 100 U/mL solution for 
injection finished product preparations. The active substance used in this formulation is of the same 
quality as that used for the manufacture of the already approved 100 U/mL solution for injection, thus 
no new information or assessment is required.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The 300U pen contains 1.5 mL of solution for injection, which is equivalent to 450 Units (450U is  
indicated on the pen). Each mL contains 300 Units insulin glargine (equivalent to 10.91 mg). 
The registered Insulin glargine 100U/mL solution for injection is a 3 mL cartridge containing 100U/mL. 
Compared to the 100U/mL presentation, the 300U/mL presentation contains a threefold amount of 
insulin glargine as well as a threefold amount of zinc chloride per mL.  The amounts of other excipients 
are similar to the 100U/mL composition. 
The insulin glargine finished product is contained in a sealed cartridge assembled into a pen injector. 
The pen injector is operated fully mechanically and does not contain electronics. The construction of 
the U300 pen injector is based on SoloStar®, an insulin injection device which is marketed world-wide 
by Sanofi since 2007. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process and the process controls correspond to those approved for the marketed 
insulin  glargine  solution  for  injection  100  U/mL  process.  During  development  only  minor  changes 
were made in the manufacturing procedure to adapt the process to the scaled up batch sizes. The 
presentation was changed from a 3 mL to a 1.5 mL cartridge.  
The manufacturing process is described in detail.  The critical process controls in place are deemed 
sufficient.  
No animal and/or human derived material is used. No novel excipients are used. 
Product specification 
Overall  the  finished  product  is  considered  sufficiently  controlled.  The  analytical  procedures  are 
sufficiently described and appropriately validated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/157145/2015  
Page 8/74 
 
 
 
The end of shelf life specifications are brought in line with the specifications for the 100U/ml 
presentation.  
Stability of the product 
Overall the stability (and in-use stability) of Insulin Glargine (300U/ml) filled in the 1.5 ml cartridge 
has  been  sufficiently  demonstrated  for  its  intended  use.  The  stability  data  provided  supports  the 
proposed shelf life of 30 months at +2°C to 8°C and an in-use period of 4 weeks at up to 30°C.  
Adventitious agents 
No materials of human or animal origin are used during manufacture. There is no viral safety risk 
since  the  same  active  substance  is  used  as  for  the  approved  insulin  glargine  100U/mL  and  the 
manufacturing process and the process controls of the insulin glargine 300 U/mL correspond to insulin 
glargine 100U/mL. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on composition, pharmaceutical development and manufacture has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner.  
Compared  to  the  registered  100U/mL  insulin  glargine  presentation,  the  300U/mL  line  extension 
contains a threefold amount of insulin glargine as well as a threefold amount of zinc chloride per mL.  
The amounts of other excipients remain the same. No further development has been performed. 
The  manufacturing  process  is  deemed  sufficiently  described  and  validated.  Overall,  the  finished 
product is well controlled. The list of specification tests, their limits and justifications, the validation of 
the methods as well as the characterization of impurities are considered appropriate.   
The company presents the 300U pen injector as a 1U-80U dosing system and the accuracy of the 
1U-80U dosing is suited for its purpose. 
Overall the stability (and in-use stability) of Insulin Glargine (300U/mL) filled in the 1.5 mL cartridge 
is sufficiently demonstrated for its intended use. The results generated during the stability studies 
support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Overall,  information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  finished  product  has  been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency 
and uniformity of important quality characteristics.  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction, Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics 
Given the drug substance is the same in HOE901-U100 formulation and HOE901-U300 formulation, 
the  nonclinical  profile  of  insulin  glargine  has  been  well  characterized.  Therefore,  no  additional 
nonclinical studies were performed with the HOE901-U300 formulation, except for a local tolerance 
study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/157145/2015  
Page 9/74 
 
 
 
2.3.2.  Toxicology 
Local Tolerance  
Both HOE901 formulations (100 U/mL and 300 U/mL), did not cause any local effects at the injection 
sites different from saline solution-treated injection sites. The U300 formulation showed the same 
good local tolerability as the U100 formulation following subcutaneous administration, which is the 
intended route of clinical use. Following intramuscular, intravenous and paravenous administration, 
representing the potential false administration routes, also a good tolerability was seen. 
2.3.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Insuline glargine is a protein which will rapidly be degraded in the environment. 
Furthermore,  insulin  glargine  is  already  used  in  existing  marketed  products  and  no  significant 
increase in environmental exposure is anticipated, since patients who switch to a different strength 
will not start using more insulin glargine.   
Therefore insulin glargine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Repeat-dose  toxicity  of  insulin  glargine  (HOE901-U100)  has  been  studied  in  the  mouse  (up  to  20 
U/kg/day), rat (up to 50 U/kg/day) and dog (up to 5 U/kg/day) previously. The carcinogenic potential 
was  evaluated  up  to  12.5  U/kg/day  in  mice  and  rats.  In  all  studies  HOE901  was  administered 
subcutaneously.  In  all  species  the  toxicological  profile  was  dominated  by  the  exaggerated 
pharmacological, blood glucose lowering activity of HOE901. Since the drug substance is the same for 
both  formulations,  HOE  901-U100  and  HOE901-U300,  no  differences  in  the  nonclinical  profile  are 
expected for HOE901-U300.  
Given the drug substance is the same in HOE901-U100 formulation and HOE901-U300 formulation, 
the  nonclinical  profile  of  insulin  glargine  has  been  well  characterized.  Because  there  is  already  a 
wealth of human safety experience, the applicant believes that the results of the nonclinical studies 
conducted with HOE901-U100 and submitted to the original marketing authorization applications and 
subsequent  submissions  for  the  authorized  product  also  apply  to  HOE901-U300.  Therefore,  no 
additional  nonclinical  studies  were  performed  or  are  planned  with  the  HOE901-U300  formulation, 
which was found to be acceptable.  
The additional evaluation of local tolerability in one  dedicated study conducted in rabbits with the 
HOE901-U300  formulation  to  compare  this  formulation  with  the  HOE  901-U100  formulation  was 
considered to be sufficient by CHMP to complete the nonclinical program for insulin glargine and to 
support the use of the HOE901-U300 formulation in patients. 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From  a  non-clinical  point  of  view  there  were  no  objections  against  extending  the  Marketing 
Authorisation of the product. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
In  the  subsequent  text,  insulin  glargine  100  U/mL  is  also  referred  to  as  U100  or  as  Lantus  (a 
commercial  formulation  of  insulin  glargine  100  U/mL  available  when  the  studies  included  in  this 
dossier were performed).

A total of 6 Phase 1 studies were performed with HOE901-U300 providing clinical pharmacology data 
in this submission; see Table 2. One single-dose study (PKD10086) was conducted in healthy subjects 
and  2  single-dose  studies  (PKD11627,  PKD12270)  and  3  multiple  dose  studies  (TDR11626, 
PDY12335,  and  PKD13560)  were  conducted  in  patients  with  T1DM.  All  studies  employed  the 
euglycaemic clamp technique, except PDY12335 which used CGM. 
Study PKD10086 examined the bioequivalence and equivalent bioefficacy of the insulin glargine 300 
U/mL (U300) and 100 U/mL formulations in 24 healthy male and female subjects following 2 single SC 
doses of 0.4 U/kg in a crossover design. 
Study TDR11626 investigated the safety and tolerability of 8-day repeated dose regimens at 2 dose 
levels of U300 (0.4 and 0.6 U/kg/day) and compared their PD and PK properties to those of U100 (0.4

Study PKD11627 investigated the glucodynamic activity and exposure of 3 different single SC doses 
of U300 (0.4 [T1], 0.6 [T2], and 0.9 [T3] U/kg) versus a standard dose of 0.4 U/kg U100 as comparator 
(R) in a crossover euglycaemic clamp setting in 24 male and female patients with T1DM. 
Study  PKD13560  was  a  double-blind,  randomized,  2-treatment  crossover  bioequivalence  study 
comparing 2 different formulations of U300, using the euglycaemic clamp technique, in 50 patients 
with T1DM. 
Study PKD12270 investigated the metabolic effects, the exposure to insulin glargine and the safety 
and tolerability of single SC doses of U300 in 18 Japanese T1DM patients. Two different SC doses of 
U300  (0.4  [T1]  and  0.6  [T2]  U/kg)  versus  a  standard  dose  of  0.4 U/kg  U100  as  comparator  were 
assessed in a euglycaemic clamp setting.  
Study  PDY12335  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  2-sequence,  2-period,  2-treatment  crossover 
multiple  dosing  study  in  20  Japanese  male  and  female  patients  with  T1DM  comparing  24-hour 
glycaemic profile in CGM between U300 and U100 at steady state.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine is well known. The assessment of the pharmacokinetics was 
mainly based on comparative bioavailability between the already marketed product with 100 U/ml 
and the new formulation with 300 U/ml. 
Assessment report  
EMA/157145/2015  
Page 12/74 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
After administration of the new formulation in equal doses at steady state as insulin glargine 100 U/ml, 
the rate of absorption is considerably lower but the extent is more a less similar (study 11626). The 
new  formulation  shows  a  flatter  concentration-time  curve  reflecting  in  a  low  PTF  and  fluctuation 
compared with 100U/ml (see figure below) 
. 
Figure 1 - Mean (± S.D.) insulin glargine concentration time profiles starting with dosing 
on Day 8 (at steady state) with the old formulation (R) and new formulation (T). 
The  old  formulation  of  100  U/ml  is  not  bioequivalent  with  the  new  formulation  of  300  U/ml  after 
subcutaneous administration of single equal doses to healthy subjects (study 10086). The extent of 
exposure  (AUC)  after  administration  of  the  new  formulation  with  300  U/ml  is  only  65%  of  the 
exposure after administration of the old formulation of 100 U/ml. 
After  administration  of  0.4  U/kg  and  0.6  U/kg  of  the  new  formulation  (300  U/ml)  as  single  doses 
(study 11627) to patients with type 1 diabetes, the exposure was nearly similar for the rate as well as 
for the extent and was half of the value after administration of 0.4 U/kg as insulin glargine 100U/ml. 
After administration of 0.9 U/kg as the new formulation a comparable exposure was achieved. 
The addition of polysorbate to the new formulation (study 13560) did not influence the bioavailability 
of  insulin  glargine  after  subcutaneous  administration  of  0.4  U/kg.  The  90%  CI  is  well  within  the 
acceptance range of bioequivalence. 
Interactions 
No new studies were conducted to evaluate effects of extrinsic factors to support the registration and 
approval of HOE901-U300. Further information on such studies previously performed and submitted 
had been assessed in the original marketing application for insulin glargine (HOE901-U100; Lantus 
[EMEA/H/C/000284] and Optisulin [EMEA/H/C/000309]). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
With respect to dose proportionality after administration of different doses with the new formulation, 
no conclusion can be drawn as the absorption from the injection site behaves rather erratic.  
After administration of different amount of insulin glargine the following concentration-time curves 
were determined.

subcutaneous administration of three different doses of the new formulation and one dose 
of the old formulation 
Special populations 
The lack of studies in special populations is acceptable for this variation. 
The studies in Japanese patients did only reveal that the bioavailability between the two different 
formulations  are  considerably  different  and  comparable  with  Caucasian  patients.  The  exposure  in 
Japanese volunteers however is lower. As there is no direct pharmacokinetic comparison, a conclusion 
on the influence of race is not possible. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin glargine, like human insulin acts via the human insulin receptor system. The primary activity 
of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogues 
lower BG levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and 
by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis, 
and enhances protein synthesis. 
Primary pharmacology 
Study  PKD10086  (single  dose  in  healthy  volunteers)  did  not  demonstrate  equivalence  in  terms  of 
bioavailability or activity between the 300 U/mL and the 100 U/mL solutions for injection, although 
the  300  U/mL  (U300)  formulation  produced  less  fluctuation  in  insulin  glargine  concentration  and 
activity around the averages compared with the 100 U/mL formulation. 
In  Study PKD11627 (T1DM) single dose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles for U300 
treatments (T1 to T3) were flatter and prolonged over the 36 hours observation period as compared 
to 0.4 U/kg U100 treatment , and the exposure (INS-AUC0-36) and glucose disposal (GIR-AUC0-36h) 
were lower for matching doses. 
Study TDR11626 investigated the safety and tolerability of 8-day repeated dose regimens at 2 dose 
levels of U300 (0.4 and 0.6 U/kg/day) and compared their PD and PK properties to those of U100 (0.4 
U/kg/day) in a crossover euglycaemic clamp setting in steady state conditions, at the end of each 
treatment period, in 30 patients with T1DM.  
U300  displayed  a  flatter  and  more  constant  serum  insulin  glargine  and  glucodynamic  profile  as 
compared to Lantus, particularly over the first 24 hours after last dosing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/157145/2015  
Page 14/74 
 
 
 
 
Insulin  glargine  exposure  was  quantifiable  in  more  than  50%  of  subjects  until  32  and  36  hours 
sampling times post U300 dose, for 0.4 and 0.6 U/kg/day, respectively and U100 was quantifiable 
until 28 hours post dose. Exposure to insulin glargine and activity was slightly lower within 24 hours 
with U300 than with U100 with matching doses (INS-AUC0-24; point-estimated treatment ratio 0.83 
[90% CI: 0.69 to 1.00)]), with little or no difference within 36 hours (INS-AUC0-36; point-estimated 
treatment ratio 0.93 [90% CI: 0.77 to 1.12]). The higher dose of U300 produced a correspondingly 
greater exposure and activity with otherwise similar concentration and activity time profiles. 
During the 36-hour clamp period, BG was more tightly controlled and for longer with both doses of 
U300 than with 0.4 U/kg U100 at or below 110, 130 and 150 mg/dL, as well as at or below the level 
of euglycaemia (≤105 mg/dL). The end of activity was later for both doses of U300 than for 0.4 U/kg 
U100. 
In addition, the differentiation between parent compound, insulin glargine, and 2 metabolites (M1 and 
M2)  in  plasma  was  generated  as  supportive  data,  using  a  specific  LC-MS/MS  assay  with 
immunoaffinity  enriched  metabolites.  This  analysis  confirmed  comparable  metabolism  of  insulin 
glargine regardless of the formulation, with the main metabolite being M1 (21A-Gly-human insulin). 
Also, steady state (for M1) was reached after 3 to 4 days of treatment with U300 compared with 1 to 
2 days with U100.

Figure 3 - TDR11626 - 36-hour mean smoothed glucose infusion rate profiles at steady 
state for 0.4 U/kg U100 and 0.4 U/kg U300 
The flatter and prolonged concentration and glucodynamic time profiles observed in study PKD11627 
were confirmed in study PKD12270 in Japanese patients with T1DM.  
Study  PDY12335  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  2-sequence,  2-period,  2-treatment  crossover 
multiple  dosing  study  in  20  Japanese  male  and  female  patients  with  T1DM  comparing  24-hour 
glycaemic profile in CGM between U300 and Lantus at steady state. The mean CGM profiles from Day 
2 18:00 to Day 3 24:00 of CGM periods suggest similar BG concentration profiles over time with U300 
and U100.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Of the 100 patients with T1DM participating in the cross-over multiple dose studies of the Phase 1 
program and for whom AIA assessments were available, 68 were AIA-negative and 32 AIA-positive 
prior to treatment. All 32 AIA-positive patients showed cross-reactivity to human insulin. Five patients 
with  a  negative  AIA  status  at  baseline  converted  to  positive  status  at  the  end  of  the  studies.  All 
patients positive prior to treatment remained positive at the end of the studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/157145/2015  
Page 15/74 
 
 
 
 
  
 
The  mean  exposure  to  free  insulin  glargine  for  AIA-positive  patients  receiving  U300  or  U100  was 
reduced, and this was more pronounced at a lower dose. 
The impact of AIA status on pharmacodynamic responses was less pronounced as on exposure, with 
no difference between U300 and U100, and became negligible with higher dose.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  PD  of  insulin  glargine  300  U/mL  (U300)  was  compared  to  U100  (Lantus)  in  6  phase  1  trials 
involving  24  healthy  subjects  and  142  subjects  with  T1DM  using  PK  assessments  and  mostly 
euglycaemic clamps for PD. 
The  U300  and  U100  formulations  are  not  bio-equivalent.  The  single  and  multiple  dose 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles for U300 are flatter and prolonged over the 36 hours 
observation period as compared to U100. 
At  steady  state  with  equal  doses  of  the  new  formulation  300  U/ml  and  100  U/ml,  the  rate  of 
absorption  was  considerably  lower  with  the  new  formulation  but  extent  was  more  or  less  similar: 
INS-AUC0-24 point-estimated treatment ratio 0.83 (90% CI: 0.69 to 1.00), with little or no difference 
within 36 hours. 
After single dose administration the extent of exposure of the new formulation was only 50-65% of 
that of 100 U/ml. 
Overall it can be concluded that direct switching from the old formulation of 100 U/ml to the new 
formulation of 300 U/ml with equal doses is not warranted by the pharmacokinetic data after single 
doses.  However,  after  repeated  dosing  a  lower  Cmax  is  achieved  resulting  in  a  less  variable 
plasma-concentration-time curve and a more or less similar extent of exposure.   
In all pharmacokinetic studies insulin glargine U300 was administered subcutaneously by injection in 
the periumbilical area of the abdomen. The SmPC recommends injection in the abdomen wall, the 
deltoid or the thigh. In the clinical phase 3 studies, no significant differences between HOE901-U300 
and U100 was observed in HbA1c or hypoglycaemia when different injections sites (abdomen or thigh) 
were used. The data for the injection site “upper arm” is scarce but evoke no concern.  The same 
administration recommendations as for Lantus are thus supported. 
Further analysis confirmed comparable metabolism of insulin glargine regardless of the formulation, 
with the main metabolite being M1 (21A-Gly-human insulin). Also, steady state (for M1) was reached 
after 3 to 4 days of treatment with U300 compared with 1 to 2 days with U100. 
In these short-term studies, formation of anti-insulin antibodies was similar between the U100 and 
U300 formulations. The impact of AIA status on pharmacodynamic responses was less pronounced as 
on exposure, with no difference between U300 and U100, and became negligible with higher dose. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The new formulation of insulin glargine 300 U/ml is not bioequivalent to the old formulation 100 U/ml.  
The single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles for U300 are flatter and 
prolonged over the 36 hours observation period as compared to U100. Direct switching from the old 
formulation of 100 U/ml to the new formulation of 300 U/ml with equal doses is not warranted by the 
pharmacokinetic  data  after  single  doses.  However,  after  repeated  dosing  a  lower  Cmax is  achieved 
resulting is a less variable plasma-concentration-time curve and a similar extent of exposure.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Data  supporting  the  efficacy  of  U300  are  based  on  results  from  the  main  6-month  on-treatment 
period of 4 multinational, open-label, randomized, controlled, Phase 3 studies in patients with T1DM 
(EFC12456)  and  T2DM  (EFC11628,  EFC11629  and  EFC12347).  In  these  Phase  3  studies,  the 
objectives were to demonstrate that U300 is as effective as Lantus in terms of HbA1c reduction, and 
based on the PK/PD profile shown in the euglycaemic clamp studies is associated with a lower risk of 
hypoglycaemia.  
The  exploratory  Phase  2  study  PDY12777  employing  CGM  provides  supportive  efficacy  data  in 
patients with T1DM. Results from two 3-month administration substudies embedded in the extension 
periods of studies EFC11628 and EFC11629 in patients with T2DM support the efficacy and safety of 
U300 when administered at intervals up to 3 hours earlier or later than the patient’s usual 24-hour 
injection interval.

Methods 
The  4  Phase  3  studies  were  multinational,  multicenter,  open-label,  centrally  randomized, 
comparative,  parallel  group  studies,  each  comprising  a  6-month  main  study  period  followed  by  a 
6-month comparative safety extension period. The studies EFC11628 and EFC11629 also included a 
4-week post-treatment follow-up period after completion of the 52-week study duration. The active 
control was Lantus in all studies. The studies utilized a common core protocol that standardized most

aspects  of  the  study  design,  including  the  comparator  Lantus  (insulin  glargine  100  U/mL),  1:1 
randomization, stratification by screening HbA1c (<8.0% versus ≥8.0%), inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
targets for fasting pre-breakfast self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG), recommendations for dosing 
of  U300  and  Lantus,  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  variables  and  safety  variables,  including  the 
definitions used for the hypoglycaemia categories and analyses. All 4 Phase 3 studies were designed 
to show noninferiority of U300 versus Lantus based on the change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint 
at Month 6 with a noninferiority margin of 0.4% HbA1c. 
In both studies in T1DM (EFC12456, PDY12777) patients were randomized to morning or evening 
injections of U300 and Lantus to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different injection times of U300. 
Study  PDY12777  was  an  exploratory,  open-label,  randomized,  parallel-group  Phase  2  study  to 
compare the efficacy and safety of U300 and Lantus in patients with T1DM using CGM parameter. 
Within each treatment group of U300 or Lantus the sequence of the injection time of the basal insulin 
during the 8-week study period A followed by 8-week study period B was assigned by randomization 
(morning-evening or evening-morning; 1:1). The study consisted of an up to 4-week screening and 
training period, a treatment period of 2 x 8 weeks, and a 4-week post-treatment follow-up period. 
The primary endpoint was the percentage of time in glucose range 4.4 to 7.8 mmol/L (80 to 140 
mg/dL) as measured by CGM during the last 2 weeks of both 8-week treatment periods. 
The efficacy and safety of U300 when injected at intervals of up to 3 hours earlier or later than the 
patient’s usual once daily injection time was evaluated in 2 substudies embedded in the extension 
periods of studies EFC11628 and EFC11629 in T2DM. Both substudies were open-label, randomized 
(1:1), 3-month studies in patients who were randomized and treated with U300 during the main study 
periods and had completed the 6-month study visit.  
All studies comprised an up to 2-week screening period, during which the patients’ eligibility criteria 
were checked and patients were trained on study procedures such as regular SMPG measurements 
and diary entries. The duration of the pivotal efficacy studies was 6 months (main study periods). The 
6-month  main  study  period  duration  with  a  “treat-to-target”  dosing  schedule  of  the  insulin  is 
considered to be sufficient for achieving glycaemic control with U300 or Lantus after changing over 
from the pre-study basal insulin or initiating basal insulin in previously insulin-naïve patients. The 
6-month period enabled an adequate assessment of the changes in HbA1c and the concomitant risk of 
hypoglycaemia during both the initial period after changing to a new insulin regimen, when most of 
the  adjustment  to  the  insulin  dose  occurred,  and  the  maintenance  period,  when  only  minor 
refinements of the insulin dose were made. 
Study participants 
Separate studies were done in T1DM and T2DM due to the different underlying pathophysiologies. 
Three studies were done in T2DM to cover the broad spectrum of this patient population, including 
insulin-naïve patients not adequately controlled on non-insulin AHA and requiring insulin, patients 
already treated with basal insulin in combination with OAD, and patients requiring basal and mealtime 
insulin for glycaemic control. Adult patients at least 18 years of age with a screening HbA1c in the 
range of ≥7.0 to ≤10.0% for insulin-pretreated patients (EFC11628, EFC11629, EFC12456) and ≤
9.0%  (PDY12777)  or  ≥7.0  to  ≤11.0%  in  insulin-naïve  patients  (EFC12347)  were  eligible  for  the 
studies. Patients with T1DM had to be on basal insulin in combination with a mealtime insulin for at 
least one year, insulin-naïve T2DM patients had to have a known history of T2DM for at least one year 
and  pretreatment  with  non-insulin  AHA  for  6 months  and  sulfonylurea  and  glinides  were  to  be 
discontinued at baseline   
 (EFC12347).  T2DM  patients  pretreated  with  basal  insulin  in  combination  with  OAD  had  to  be 
receiving  this  insulin  regimen  for  at  least  6 months  (EFC11629)  and  patients  with  T2DM  on  basal 
insulin  in  combination  with  a  mealtime  insulin  had  to  be  on  this  regimen  for  at  least  1  year 
(EFC11628). In studies EFC11628 and EFC11629 in T2DM patients pretreated with basal insulin the 
daily basal insulin dose had to be at least 42 U.

Study  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  selecting the  patient population  were  as  unrestrictive as 
possible across the studies to reflect the general population of patients with diabetes mellitus. Only 
patients  with  concomitant  illnesses or  medications  that  could  limit the  ability  of  patients  to  safely 
complete the study periods, confound the evaluation of study findings, or that conformed to potential 
contraindications of insulin therapy, were excluded.  
Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective of the Phase 3 studies was to demonstrate noninferiority of U300 
versus Lantus on glycaemic control in adults as measured by: 
•  EFC12456 (T1DM) and EFC11628, EFC11629, and EFC12347 (all T2DM): change in glycated 
HbA1c from baseline to endpoint (Month 6) measured in a central laboratory. The  studies 
were designed to show noninferiority of U300 versus Lantus with a noninferiority margin of 
0.4% HbA1c. 
•  Substudies EFC11628 and EFC11629 (T2DM): change in HbA1c from Month 6 (baseline of 
substudy) to Month 9 (endpoint of substudy). 
The secondary efficacy objectives for the Phase 3 studies were to compare U300 and Lantus on 
Nocturnal hypoglycaemia, Pre-injection plasma glucose, Variability of pre-injection plasma glucose 
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), % patients overall and without hypoglycaemia reaching HbA1c <7%, 
% patients reaching FPG target overall and without hypoglycaemia FPG targets (<5.6 mmol/L (100 
mg/dL) in studies in T2DM and <7.2 mmol/L, (130 mg/dL) in T1DM), 8-point SMPG profiles (taken at 
03:00 hours, before and 2 hours after each main meal, and at bedtime), 24-hour average plasma 
glucose and variability of 24-hour average plasma glucose. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
In the 4 pivotal Phase 3 studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to endpoint 
(Month 6) in HbA1c. Noninferiority was tested with a noninferiority margin of 0.4% HbA1c, which was 
in agreement with the guidance documents of the key regulatory agencies at the time of planning the 
Phase 3 program. The change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint (Month 6) was analyzed using a 
Mixed Model for Repeated Measurements (MMRM) approach under the missing at random framework 
in  the  4  pivotal  studies,  but  was  also  analyzed  using  Last  Observation  Carried  Forward  (LOCF) 
imputation in the CSRs for EFC11628 and EFC11629. The primary efficacy analysis was based on the 
modified  intent-to-treat  (mITT)  population.  The  mITT  population  was  defined  as  all  randomized 
patients who received at least one dose of open-label U300 or Lantus study medication, and who had 
both a baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment of any primary or secondary 
efficacy endpoint. 
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary  endpoints  included  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  at  least  one  nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia  from  start  of  Week 9  to  Month  6,  severe  hypoglycaemia  and  hypoglycaemia 
documented  by  SMPG  ≤3.9  mmol/L  (70 mg/dL),  pre-injection  plasma  glucose,  fasting  plasma 
glucose (FPG), 8-point SMPG profiles, fasting pre-breakfast SMPG and insulin doses.  
Statistical methods 
In order to investigate the clinical correlates of the flatter profile and longer duration of action of U300 
compared  with  Lantus  in  the  Phase  1  PK/PD  studies,  3  main  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were 
pre-specified in the protocols of the 3 Phase 3 studies in T2DM (EFC11628, EFC11629, EFC12347). 
Superiority of U300 over Lantus was tested in a pre-specified order of priority only if noninferiority of 
U300 versus Lantus was demonstrated for the primary endpoint (hierarchical testing strategy). This 
stepwise closed testing procedure stopped as soon as a test for an endpoint was found not statistically 
significant.  The  hypotheses  of  “less  nocturnal  hypoglycaemia”  and  “more  sustained  duration  of 
action” were sequentially tested in terms of a lower incidence of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, a larger

decrease and lower variability of pre-basal insulin injection plasma glucose. These main secondary 
efficacy endpoints were not part of a hierarchical testing procedure in study EFC12456 in T1DM, but 
assessed as other secondary efficacy endpoints.   
For the 2 Phase 3 studies (EFC11629 and EFC12347) with non-insulin AHA as background therapy, a 
meta-analysis based on pooled efficacy data from the main 6-month on-treatment period was also 
performed. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The  distribution  of  missing  data  patterns  of  HbA1c  and  number  of  patients  excluded  from  primary 
efficacy analysis in each treatment group are presented per study with associated reasons (Figure 4, 
Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). 
No differences between U300 and Lantus were found for demographics and baseline characteristics 
across missing data patterns of HbA1c. Nor was there any difference between treatment groups within 
each missing data pattern.

Baseline data 
All Phase 2/3 studies were well balanced regarding the baseline characteristics. The studies included 
608 randomized patients with T1DM and 2496 randomized patients with T2DM; 719 (23.2%) patients 
were aged 65 years or older, 1872 (75.0%) patients with T2DM had a body mass index (BMI) of at 
least 30 kg/m² and 495 (15.9%) patients had some degree of renal impairment (GFR [MDRD] ≤60 
mL/min). The majority of the patients were Caucasian/white (n=2717; 87.5%), other ethnicities were 
represented by n=210 (6.8%) Black, n=144 (4.6%) Asian/Oriental, and  n=463 (14.9%) Hispanic 
(Table 6).  Geographical  areas  included  North  America,  South  America,  Europe,  South  Africa,  and 
Japan.  Overall,  patients  treated  in  the  4 pivotal  Phase 3  studies  adequately  represent  the  patient 
population who might be expected to receive U300 when marketed after approval.

Title:  A 6-Month, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label, Parallel-group Study Comparing the Efficacy 
and Safety of a New Formulation of Insulin Glargine and Lantus Injected in the Morning or Evening in 
Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with a 6-month Safety Extension Period 
Study identifier  EFC12456 (EudraCT: 2012-001524-35) 
Design 
This was a Phase 3, 6-month, multicenter, multinational, open-label, randomized, 
4-arm parallel-group study followed by a 6-month safety extension period to 
compare the efficacy and safety of HOE901-U300 and Lantus morning and evening 
injection in patients with T1DM, and HbA1c in the range of 7% to 10%, who had been 
on a basal plus mealtime insulin regimen for at least 1 year. Patients were 
randomized to receive either HOE901-U300 or Lantus as a morning or evening 
injection (randomization ratio 1:1:1:1). Randomization was stratified by HbA1c 
obtained at the screening visit (<8.0%, ≥8.0%) and geographical region 
(Non-Japan; Japan). “Morning” was defined as any time immediately prior to 
breakfast until lunch and “evening” as any time immediately prior to the evening meal 
until bedtime.

Statistical 
methods 
A stepwise closed testing approach was used for the primary efficacy variable to 
assess noninferiority and superiority sequentially. To assess noninferiority, the upper 
bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the mean change in HbA1c from 
baseline to endpoint between HOE901-U300 overall and Lantus overall was compared 
with the predefined noninferiority margin of 0.4% HbA1c, a value <0.4% 
demonstrated noninferiority. 
If noninferiority was demonstrated, superiority of HOE901-U300 overall over Lantus 
overall was tested. The superiority of HOE901-U300 overall over Lantus overall was 
demonstrated if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the 
mean change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint between HOE901-U300 overall and 
Lantus overall on mITT population was <0 (zero).

Title:  6-Month, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label, Parallel-group Study Comparing the Efficacy and 
Safety of a New Formulation of Insulin Glargine and Lantus both plus Mealtime Insulin in Patients with 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with a 6-month Safety Extension Period  
Study identifier  EFC11628 (EudraCT: 2010-023769-23) 
Design 
This was a Phase 3, 6-month, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group 
study followed by a 6-month safety extension period to compare the efficacy and 
safety of HOE901-U300 and Lantus in patients with T2DM, and HbA1c in the range 7% 
to 10%, injecting at least 42 U Lantus or equivalent NPH insulin. As there were no 
generally accepted recommendations for the switch from insulin detemir to insulin 
glargine, insulin detemir was considered a prohibited prior medication in the last 3 
months before screening visit for T2DM patients on previous insulin treatment. 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either HOE901-U300 or Lantus. The 
randomization was stratified by screening HbA1c value (<8%, ≥8%).

A stepwise closed testing approach was used for the primary efficacy variable to 
assess noninferiority and superiority sequentially. To assess noninferiority, the upper 
bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the mean change in HbA1c from 
baseline to endpoint between HOE901-U300 and Lantus was compared with the 
predefined noninferiority margin of 0.4% HbA1c, a value <0.4% demonstrates 
noninferiority. 
If noninferiority was demonstrated, superiority of HOE901-U300 over Lantus was 
tested. The superiority of HOE901-U300 over Lantus was demonstrated if the upper 
bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the mean change in HbA1c from 
baseline to endpoint between HOE901-U300 and Lantus on mITT population was <0 
(zero).

This was a Phase 3, 6-month, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group 
followed by a 6-month safety extension period to compare the efficacy and safety of 
HOE901-U300 and Lantus in patients with T2DM, and HbA1c in the range 7% to 10%, 
injecting at least 42 U Lantus or equivalent NPH insulin with OADs. As there were no 
generally accepted recommendations for the switch from insulin detemir to insulin 
glargine, insulin detemir was considered a prohibited prior medication in the last 3 
months before screening visit for T2DM patients on previous insulin treatment. 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either HOE901-U300 or Lantus.

Design 
This was a Phase 3, 6-month, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group 
study followed by a 6-month safety extension period to compare the efficacy and 
safety of HOE901-U300 and Lantus in insulin-naïve patients with T2DM, and HbA1c in 
the range 7% to 11%, not adequately controlled with non-insulin AHA. Patients were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either HOE901-U300 or Lantus. The 
randomization was stratified by screening HbA1c at screening (<8%, ≥8%) and 
geographical region (Non-Japan or Japan).

A stepwise closed testing approach was used for the primary efficacy variable to 
assess noninferiority and superiority sequentially. To assess noninferiority, the upper 
bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the mean change in HbA1c from 
baseline to endpoint between HOE901-U300 and Lantus was compared with the 
predefined noninferiority margin of 0.4% HbA1c, a value <0.4% demonstrates 
noninferiority. 
If noninferiority was demonstrated, superiority of HOE901-U300 over Lantus was 
tested. The superiority of HOE901-U300 over Lantus was demonstrated if the upper 
bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the mean change in HbA1c from 
baseline to endpoint between HOE901-U300 and Lantus on mITT population was <0 
(zero).

Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies were conducted specifically to address the efficacy of U300 in the elderly, in children, or in 
subjects  with  impaired  renal  or  hepatic  function.  Due  to  the  structural  similarity  between  insulin 
glargine and human insulin, the same changes in pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) 
profiles,  and  therefore  efficacy,  are  expected  with  both  drugs  in  subjects  with  impaired  renal  or 
hepatic function. Careful dose titration is required in subjects with severe renal disease or hepatic 
failure  because  insulin  metabolism  is  known  to  be  impaired,  and  these  subjects  are  often  insulin 
resistant.  Insulin  requirements  may  be  altered  during  intercurrent  conditions  such  as  illness, 
emotional disturbances or stress.  
Overall  in  all  4  studies  EFC12456,  EFC11628,  EFC11629  and  EFC12347  and  the  pooled  analysis 
EFC11629  and  EFC12347,  the  treatment  effect  (mean  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  endpoint 
[Month  6])  of  U300  versus  Lantus  was  consistent  across  tested  subgroups  defined  by 
baseline/screening factors such as age, gender, race, ethnicities, baseline BMI, duration of diabetes, 
HbA1c  at  screening  (<8%  or  ≥8%)  and  geographical  area,  as  indicated  by  p-values  for 
treatment-by-subgroup interaction >0.10. In a few cases, interactions with treatment were observed 
(eg, geographical area in study EFC12456, duration of diabetes in study EFC11628); however, since 
similar  findings  were  not  observed  in  the  other  studies  and  as  no  adjustment  for  multiplicity  was 
performed,  no  conclusion  can  be  drawn  on  whether  U300  or  Lantus  performs  differently  in  some 
specific subgroups.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Primary endpoint 
Primary efficacy endpoint: change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint (Month 6) 
The primary objective of these studies, to demonstrate non-inferiority of U300 to Lantus in the change 
in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint (Month 6), was achieved in study EFC12456 in T1DM and in all 3 
studies in T2DM covering the broad range of the population of patients with T2DM (Table 11). Based 
on the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.4%, the non-inferiority of U300 compared with Lantus 
was shown as the upper bound of the 95% CI was below 0.4%, and meeting even more stringent 
Assessment report

criteria with the observed upper bound in all studies below 0.3%.  
In the study in T1DM and the 2 studies in insulin-pretreated patients with T2DM, the largest decrease 
of HbA1c occurred during the first 3 months of treatment, with only minor further decreases between 
Month 3 and Month 6. In the study in insulin-naïve T2DM patients, HbA1c continued to decrease in

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
First main secondary efficacy endpoint: Occurrence of nocturnal hypoglycaemia 
The percentage of patients with nocturnal hypoglycaemia including the categories of severe and/or 
confirmed  hypoglycaemia  by  SMPG  ≤3.9  mmol/L  (70  mg/dL)  reported  between  00:00  and 
05:59 hours  between  Week  9  and  Month  6  was  similar  in  the  U300  and  Lantus  groups  in  study 
EFC12456 in T1DM.  
In the 3 studies in T2DM (EFC11628, EFC11629, EFC12347), the percentages were consistently lower 
in the U300 groups compared with the Lantus groups reaching statistical significance in the studies in 
insulin pretreated patients with risk reductions of 21% (EFC11628) and 23% (EFC11629). In study 
EFC12347 in insulin-naïve T2DM patients the risk reduction was 11%. In patients treated with basal 
insulin in combination with non-insulin AHA risk reduction was 18% (pooled analysis EFC11629 and 
EFC12347)  (Table 12).  The  percentage  of  patients  reporting  severe  and/or  confirmed  nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia in the EFC12347 study was overall the lowest among the 3 studies in T2DM, indicating 
the overall lower risk of hypoglycaemia in this patient population with relative shorter duration of 
T2DM and only recent start of insulin treatment.

Change in pre-injection SMPG from baseline to endpoint (Month 6) 
In all 4 pivotal studies, the least square (LS) mean change from baseline to endpoint (Month 6) in 
average pre injection SMPG was similar in the U300 and Lantus groups. Similar results were also seen 
in  the  meta-analysis  on  the  pooled  data  from  the  2  studies  (EFC11629  and  EFC12347)  with 
non-insulin AHA as background therapy. Superiority of U300 with respect to Lantus was not shown in 
EFC11628 and EFC11629.  
Change in variability of pre-injection SMPG from baseline to endpoint (Month 6) 
The variability of pre-injection SMPG, calculated as mean of coefficient of variation over at least 3 
SMPG  measurements  during  the  7  days  preceding  the  visit,  decreased  from  baseline  to  endpoint 
(Month 6) similarly in the U300 and Lantus treatment groups in EFC12456 and EFC11628. In study 
EFC11629  variability  decreased  more  in  the  U300  group  than  Lantus  group.  As  no  statistically 
significant  difference  was  shown  for  the  2nd  main  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  in  EFC11628  and 
EFC11629, no testing was done in these studies for the 3rd main secondary efficacy endpoint. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints 
In all 4 studies, similar percentages of U300 and Lantus treated patients reached HbA1c levels below 
7.0% at Month 6 overall and without reporting severe and/or confirmed hypoglycaemia with the low 
threshold of <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) during the last 3 months of study treatment. 
Fasting plasma glucose (measured in the central laboratory) showed overall substantial decreases in 
both treatment groups in the 4 studies with most of the decrease seen in the first 3 months of study 
treatment. Although the difference in the LS mean change of FPG in study EFC12347 was in favor of 
Lantus, it was not associated with a greater HbA1c reduction in this study. 
In all 4 studies, the results of 8-point SMPG profiles, mean change in 24-hour average plasma glucose 
and variability of 24-hour plasma glucose in insulin-pretreated patients showed consistently similar 
improvements in the U300 and Lantus groups at the end of the 6-month treatment. 
Supportive studies 
In extension studies of two of the pivotal trials, participants were asked to deviate from the usual time 
of injection at least 2 times per week by at 3 hours. This lead to small differences in HbA1c between 
flexible  and  fixed  dosing  intervals  (HbA1c,  LS  mean  difference,  substudy  EFC11628:  0.05%, 
95% CI: -0.189 to 0.298]; EFC11629: 0.13%, 95% CI: -0.152 to 0.415). 
More than 50% of the patients with T1DM and approximately 40% of the patients with T2DM were 
AIA-positive at baseline. Anti-insulin antibody positive-patients in both the U300 and Lantus groups 
already  had  higher  basal  insulin  doses  at  baseline  compared  with  AIA-negative  patients.  Mean 
changes in U300 and Lantus doses from baseline to endpoint (Month 6) were similar regardless of the 
AIA status (positive or negative). 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/157145/2015  
Page 48/74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The 4 Phase 3 studies were multinational, multicenter, open-label, centrally randomized, comparative, 
parallel  group  studies,  each  comprising  a  6-month  main  study  period  followed  by  a  6-month 
comparative safety extension period. The studies EFC11628 and EFC11629 also included a 4-week 
post-treatment follow-up period after completion of the 52-week study duration. The active control 
was Lantus in all studies. The studies utilized a common core protocol that standardized most aspects 
of the study design, including the comparator Lantus (insulin glargine 100 U/mL), 1:1 randomization, 
stratification  by  screening  HbA1c  (<8.0%  versus  ≥8.0%),  inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  targets  for 
fasting pre-breakfast self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG), recommendations for dosing of U300 
and Lantus, primary and secondary efficacy variables and safety variables, including the definitions 
used for the hypoglycaemia categories and analyses. All 4 Phase 3 studies were designed to show 
non-inferiority  of  U300  versus  Lantus  based  on  the  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  endpoint  at 
Month 6 with a non-inferiority margin of 0.4% HbA1c. All studies had finalised their extension periods 
by September 2014. These data were submitted for the T2DM studies during the procedure by the 
Applicant. Data for EFC12456 study (T1DM) were not yet available at the time of the initial MAA, but 
will be provided post-approval. 
Separate studies were done in T1DM and T2DM due to the different underlying pathophysiologies. 
Three studies were done in T2DM to cover the broad spectrum of this patient population, including 
insulin-naïve patients not adequately controlled on non-insulin AHA and requiring insulin, patients 
already treated with basal insulin in combination with OAD, and patients requiring basal and mealtime 
insulin for glycaemic control. Adult patients at least 18 years of age with a screening HbA1c in the 
range of ≥7.0 to ≤10.0% for insulin-pretreated patients (EFC11628, EFC11629, EFC12456) and ≤9.0% 
(PDY12777) or ≥7.0 to ≤11.0% in insulin-naïve patients (EFC12347) were eligible for the studies.  
The design and conduct of the studies were appropriate to establish efficacy and safety of U300 in 
comparison  to  Lantus,  keeping  in  mind  the  large  similarities  between  the  two  products.  As  such, 
Lantus was the appropriate comparator.  
The approach to assess efficacy of the U300 insulin by a non-inferiority trial is in line with regulatory 
guidance  (CPMP/EWP/1080/00  Rev.  1)  and  accepted.  However,  the  non-inferiority  margin  is  not 
specified  in  this  guideline  and  is  not  further  justified  in  the  dossier.  In  general,  a  non-inferiority 
margin of 0.3% is used in the assessment of glucose lowering drugs. 
The Applicant has added substudies and a large number of exploratory secondary endpoints to the 
pivotal trials. These were all exploratory in nature, resulting in descriptive analyses.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The participants in the trials (taken together) were well-representative of the target population for 
U300. As the trials employed a non-inferiority design, and participation in any trial is associated with 
HbA1c improvement, baseline HbA1c is of particular importance. The baseline values were between 
8.12 and 8.58%, which is reasonable. 
Across the main studies, the discontinuation rates were generally low (7-17%) and balanced between 
groups. In studies EFC12456 and EFC12347 about 15 % of patients in both study arms discontinued. 
The reasons for discontinuation were balanced between groups. Notably, the highest discontinuation 
rate  was  observed  for  “Other  reasons”.  The  majority  of  discontinuations  were  not  safety  related. 
Single cases were due to perceived lack of efficacy or hypoglycaemia; however, these cases were 
balanced between groups. 
Primary endpoint 
In all studies, U300 was convincingly non-inferior to Lantus, with point estimates for the difference in 
HbA1c ranging from -0.03% to 0.04% and the highest upper limit of the 95% confidence interval at 
0.185%; well below the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.4%. Although a margin of 0.4% is 
Assessment report  
EMA/157145/2015  
Page 49/74 
 
 
 
considered too wide for glucose lowering drugs and 0.3 is considered more appropriate, the highest 
upper limit is also well below that margin. 
Secondary endpoints 
Summary of secondary endpoint results 
Nocturnal hypoglycaemia  
Severe  and/or  confirmed  hypoglycaemia  (SMPG  ≤3.9  mmol/L  (70  mg/dL))  during  the  night  was 
similar between groups in T1DM; in the 3 studies in T2DM the percentages were lower in the U300 
groups  compared  with  the  Lantus  groups  reaching  statistical  significance  in  the  studies  in  insulin 
pretreated patients with risk reductions of 21% (EFC11628: 36.1 vs 46.1%) and 23% (EFC11629: 
21.6 vs 27.9%).  
Change in pre-injection SMPG 
In all 4 pivotal studies, the least square (LS) mean change from baseline to endpoint (Month 6) in 
average pre-injection SMPG was similar in the U300 and Lantus groups. The prolonged duration of 
action of U300 had been expected to result in better pre-injection SMPG; the Applicant explains the 
lack of a difference by the effects of mealtime insulin injections and/or meal intake (dinner). It is usual 
in clinical practice to cover relative shortage of long-acting insulin by mealtime short acting insulin. 
Variability of pre-injection SMPG  
The variability of pre-injection SMPG, calculated as mean of coefficient of variation over at least 3 
SMPG  measurements  during  the  7  days  preceding  the  visit,  decreased  from  baseline  to  endpoint 
(Month 6) similarly in the U300 and Lantus treatment groups in EFC12456 and EFC11628. In study 
EFC11629 variability decreased more in the U300 group than Lantus group, but no testing was done 
in accordance with the hierarchical statistical analysis. 
FPG 
In all 4 pivotal studies, FPG had decreased in the U300 and Lantus groups at endpoint (Month 6), with 
a difference in the LS mean change of FPG from baseline in favour of Lantus between 0.05 and 0.39 
mmol/L. This was statistically significant in study EFC12347 and in the pooled analysis of EFC11629 
and EFC12347. This is somewhat surprising as the fasting pre-breakfast SMPG was used to titrate the 
long-acting insulin dose.;  
The prolonged action of U300 may have caused relative shift of long-acting insulin action from night 
to day. Notably, the prebreakfast SMPG (which was followed more closely than FPG) decreased more 
gradually with HOE901-U300 than with Lantus. The Applicant has clarified that the dose titration was 
indeed  steeper  in  the  HOE901-U300  group  than  in  the  Lantus  group  and  that  this  was  more 
pronounced  in  patients  without  nocturnal  hypoglycaemia.  The  Applicant  further  proposed that  the 
lack of difference between treatments could be due to the more pronounced effect of Lantus on FPG 
(when taken as an evening dose). This appears plausible. 
The  decrease  in  FPG  was  largest  in  the  first  3  months  of  study  treatment  in  all  studies  and  both 
treatment groups  
HbA1c and FPG responder analyses 
The  percentages  of  patients  reaching  HbA1c  <7.0%  and  the  percentages  of  patients  reaching 
FPG <6.7 mmol/L (120 mg/dL) at Month 6 were comparable between the U300 and Lantus groups. 
Also,  the  percentages  of  patients  reaching  these  levels  of  HbA1c  or  FPG  without  reporting  severe 
and/or confirmed hypoglycaemia by SMPG <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) any time of the day or between 
00:00  and  05:59  hours  during  the  last  3  months  of  the  main  6-month  on-treatment  period  were 
overall similar.  
Assessment report  
EMA/157145/2015  
Page 50/74 
 
 
 
8-point SMPG profile 
Eight-point profiles were comparable between treatment groups at baseline in all 4 studies and had 
decreased similarly at all timepoints at endpoint (Month 6) in both treatment groups. 
24-hour average plasma glucose 
In all 4 studies, 24-hour average plasma glucose based on the 8-point SMPG profile was comparable 
between the treatment groups and had decreased similarly in the U300 and Lantus group at Month 6. 
In study PDY12777, the glucose variation over the day was investigated by means of CGM. Although 
the time spent within the target range (4.4 to 7.8 mmol/L [80 to 140 mg/dL]) was comparable for 
Lantus  and  HOE901-U300,  the  average  glucose  profile  by  hour  of  day  appeared  flatter  with 
HOE901-U300.  This  is  in  line  with  the  flatter  PD  profile  and  longer  duration  of  action  seen  with 
HOE901-U300. The findings are not entirely in line with the findings in the CGM study in Japanese 
patients  (PDY12335).  The  Applicant  has  clarified  the  differences.  These  were  mainly  due  to 
differences  in  study  design,  conduct  and  evaluation.  It  is  noted  that  when  used  in  a  basal-bolus 
regimen no clear differences in the CGM profiles are observed between HOE901-U300 and Lantus, 
which is somewhat unexpected considering the difference in hypoglycaemia pattern. 
Fasting pre-breakfast SMPG  
Basal insulin U300 or Lantus was titrated according to the fasting pre-breakfast SMPG. Switching from 
Lantus  to  U300  is  associated  with  a  temporary  (2-4 week)  increase  in  fasting  SMPG.  Decrease  of 
fasting SMPG is faster with Lantus compared to more gradual with U300.

Doses of basal insulin and mealtime insulin preparations 
Patients pretreated with insulin 
After trial initiation, basal insulin use increased in both U300 and Lantus groups, but more in the U300 
group, resulting in approximately 10% (EFC11628, EFC11629; T2DM) to 18% (EFC12456; T1DM) 
higher U300 doses than Lantus doses at Month 6. This is representatively illustrated by Figure 8.  
Figure 8 - Mean (+/- SE) in average daily basal and mealtime insulin doses (U/kg) by visit 
during the main 6-month on-treatment period in EFC11628 mITT population 
Insulin-naïve patients with T2DM 
In study EFC12347 in insulin-naïve T2DM patients not adequately controlled on non-insulin AHA, the 
recommended starting dose was 0.2 U/kg for both U300 and Lantus. The U300 and Lantus doses were 
increased throughout the study. The increase in the insulin dose was similar in both treatment groups 
during the first 4 weeks of the study, thereafter, the U300 dose continued to increase at the same rate, 
while the Lantus dose continued to increase by smaller increments, resulting in a higher mean U300 
dose (0.62 U/kg) than Lantus dose (0.54 U/kg) at Month 6.  
Basal insulin in combination with a mealtime insulin analogue 
Mealtime insulin doses remained almost unchanged in both treatment groups when basal insulin was 
combined with mealtime insulin. The post-lunch and post-dinner plasma glucose excursions in the 
8-point SMPG profiles and the absence of a lower hypoglycaemia risk during daytime suggest that the 
optimization of the mealtime insulin doses versus the basal insulin doses could have been further 
improved.

Injection of the basal insulin in the morning or evening 
In  study  EFC12456  patients  with  T1DM  were  assigned  per  randomization  to  morning  or  evening 
injection of U300 or Lantus. At Month 6 in the morning injection groups the daily U300 (baseline: 0.31 
U/kg;  Month  6:  0.49  U/kg)  and  Lantus  doses  (baseline:  0.32  U/kg;  Month  6:  0.45  U/kg)  were 
comparable. In the evening injection groups the U300 dose was up-titrated (baseline: 0.34 U/kg; 
Month 6:  0.45 U/kg),  while  the  Lantus  dose  was  kept  almost  unchanged  during  the  study 
(baseline: 0.33 U/kg; Month 6: 0.36 U/kg), contributing to a relatively large difference between the 
U300  and  Lantus  doses  in  the  evening  injection  groups.  In  both  U300  and  Lantus  morning  and 
evening injection groups, the mealtime insulin doses were comparable and were almost unchanged 
during the study.  
At endpoint (Month 6), the total insulin dose (basal + mealtime insulin) was higher in both the U300 
morning (0.83 U/kg) and evening (0.80 U/kg) injection groups than in the Lantus morning (0.76 U/kg) 
and evening (0.69 U/kg) injection groups. 
The  increase  in  the  ratio  of  basal  insulin  over  total  insulin  was  similarly  higher  for  U300  evening 
injections (evening 0.57) than for Lantus (evening 0.52), while increase for morning injections was 
similar (U300 morning 0.61; Lantus morning 0.60). 
Injection devices in clinical studies 
In studies EFC11628 and EFC11629 the modified Solostar pen was used for administration of U300, 
allowing dose settings in multiples of 3 U. In studies EFC12347 and EFC12456 the modified Tactipen 
was  used  allowing  dose  settings  in  multiples  of  1.5 U.  The  Solostar  pen  was  used  for  injection  of 
Lantus in all studies. In all studies the dose recommendations were identical for U300 and Lantus, 
depending  on  the  fasting  pre-breakfast  SMPG.  The  insulin  titration  data  in  the  4  pivotal  studies 
suggest, that the Investigators/patients followed the titration recommendation in the study protocols 
in both treatment groups regardless of the pens used in the studies. This is shown by the substantial 
increase in the U300 and Lantus doses during the titration periods and the use of either the modified 
Solostar or the modified Tactipen did not result in a reluctance to titrate the U300 dose. It should 
however be kept in mind, that the protocol required upward titration steps of at least 10% of the 
insulin dose, precluding smaller steps which would have been possible with Lantus but not with U300. 
The pen that is proposed to be marketed is a Solostar with 1U accuracy. The pen can deliver 80 U 
maximally and thus more patients will need to inject twice compared to the pens used in the clinical 
studies. However, the benefit of the new pen is that it allows for more precise adjustment (one unit) 
and mix-ups of the pens for U300 and Lantus do not lead to a different injected dose, as the absolute 
number of units injected is the same for both pens. 
Rescue treatment 
Rescue treatment was started in a low number of patients in both treatment groups without notable 
differences. 
Efficacy in morning and evening injection  
In study EFC12456 and in the exploratory CGM study PDY12777, both conducted in patients with 
T1DM, patients were randomized to receive U300 or Lantus once daily in the morning (any time prior 
to breakfast until lunch) or evening (anytime immediately prior to the evening meal until bedtime).  
At the end of the 6-month treatment period in the study EFC12456, HbA1c had decreased similarly in 
the morning injection groups of U300 and Lantus, whereas a smaller decrease was seen in the U300 
evening injection group compared with the Lantus evening injection group. Comparing morning and 
evening injection groups within the U300 group, the morning injection resulted in a larger decrease of 
Assessment report  
EMA/157145/2015  
Page 53/74 
 
 
 
HbA1c  than  the  evening  injection,  although  the  LS  mean  difference  between  U300  morning  and 
evening injection group was not clinically relevant.  
Extension phase 
Data from the extension phases in the T2DM trials (12 months) showed that the effect on HbA1c is 
maintained over the 12 month period with only modest increase in insulin dose. The effect of U300 
remains  comparable  to  that  of  Lantus  but  with  a  lower  rate  of  hypoglycaemia  (and  especially 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia) in insulin-experienced patients. 
Discussion of secondary endpoints 
The key secondary endpoint of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was achieved in two trials in T2DM. In T1DM, 
there  was  a  slight  increase  in  risk.  When  compared  to  the  more  comprehensive  analysis  of 
hypoglycaemias  in  the  safety  section,  there  are  overall  small  advantages  which  may  be  clinically 
relevant for some patients. 
Most other endpoints were exploratory and descriptive only. The results confirm the large similarities 
between  Lantus  and  U300.  As  expected,  hypoglycaemias  and  variability  with  U300  are  somewhat 
reduced.  
Basal Insulin use is increased with U300 by 10-18% compared to Lantus. The clinical relevance of this 
finding  is  unclear,  but  may  be  limited  as  this  is  not  associated  with  increased  hypoglycaemias  or 
additional  increase  in  weight  (see  Safety  section).  It  may  be  due  to  the  somewhat  reduced 
bioavailability, as measured in PK/PD studies. 
Most  patients  use  Lantus  in  the  evening.  When  U300  is  compared  to  Lantus,  the  more  prolonged 
release profile of U300 causes a shift in insulin availability from the night to the day. As the basal 
insulin dose is adjusted based on fasting glucose and thus on nightly insulin levels, more basal insulin 
will be required to achieve the same insulin exposure overnight. Apparently, the extra basal insulin 
that  is  available  during  the  day  has  no  clinical  consequences.  No  reduction  of  prandial  insulin  is 
observed; apparently prandial insulin doses are mainly based on dietary habits. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
U300 has similar efficacy when compared to Lantus.  The more gradual glucose lowering effect of 
U300 when compared to Lantus does not translate into important advantages. The higher use of basal 
insulin may be a disadvantage.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
All subjects and patients from Phase 1 and Phase 2/3 studies who were randomized and received at 
least one dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP) were evaluated for safety. The studies 
supporting the clinical safety of U300 are EFC11628, EFC11629 and EFC12347 in patients with T2DM 
and studies EFC12456 and PDY12777 in T1DM (Table 13).

Common adverse events 
During the main 6-month period the number of patients with TEAEs and overall pattern of TEAEs were 
comparable between the treatment groups. TEAEs were reported in 62.8% and 58.9% of U300 and 
Lantus treated patients respectively in T1DM studies, and in 57.3% and 53.7% of patients, 
respectively in T2DM studies. In both treatment groups the most commonly reported TEAEs at the 
system organ class (SOC) level were Infections and Infestations, with nasopharyngitis and upper 
respiratory tract infection the most common preferred terms (PT) in both T1DM and T2DM (Table 14).

TEAEs sorted by frequency in all U300 patients.  
Most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity, 5.1% of the U300 treated patients and 4.1% 
of the Lantus patients had an event of severe intensity; the most frequent in both groups being 
hypoglycaemia (U300 0.5% and Lantus 0.8%). The percentage of patients with TEAEs considered 
related to IMP treatment was low and similar in the U300 (5.6%) and Lantus (5.3%) groups; the most 
common TEAEs related to IMP were hypoglycaemia (U300 0.5% and Lantus 0.7%) and headache 
(U300 0.5% and Lantus 0.4%). 
The results of the subgroup analyses for most common TEAEs were consistent with those for the 
overall population in the T1DM and the T2DM pools.

Severe hypoglycaemia 
In T1DM (study EFC12456), rates of severe hypoglycaemia events per patient-year exposure tended 
to be smaller in the U300 group compared with the Lantus group (Table 16). This difference is driven 
by daytime events. During the first 8 weeks of study treatment the rate of severe hypoglycaemia was 
similar between groups. Comparable rates were also found between treatment groups for the 
morning and evening injection groups, with lower rates after morning injection.

In all 3 studies in T2DM severe hypoglycaemia was reported with similar frequency in the U300 and 
Lantus  treatment  groups  (Table 17);  with  U300,  28/1242  (2.3%)  patients  experienced  severe 
hypoglycaemia, with Lantus 33/1246 (2.6%) patients. The highest number of severe hypoglycaemia

was reported in study EFC11628 in patients with basal insulin in combination with mealtime insulin. 
The event rates per patient-year for severe hypoglycaemia were low and comparable between the 
treatment  groups  in  all  3  studies.  During  the  initial  8  weeks  of  study  treatment,  a  comparable 
percentage  of  patients  reported  severe  hypoglycaemia,  and  similarly  the  rate  of  severe 
hypoglycaemia per patient-year in each of the 3 studies in T2DM was comparable.

All hypoglycaemia 
Some important classes of hypoglycaemia events are summarised in Table 18.  
In both studies in T1DM, comparable percentages of patients reported at least one hypoglycaemia 
event  for  each  individual  category  of  hypoglycaemia  including  the  category  of  severe  and/or 
confirmed  hypoglycaemia.  Also,  comparable  percentages  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups 
reported nocturnal or daytime hypoglycaemia. The graph of the cumulative mean number of severe 
and/or confirmed (≤3.9 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]) hypoglycaemia events suggests comparable number of 
events during the first 3 months of study treatment in the U300 and Lantus group, thereafter, the 
number of events increases modestly in the U300 group over the Lantus group (Figure 9). 
During the first 8 weeks of study treatment hypoglycaemia events of any category were reported by 
a comparable percentage of patients in both treatment groups. Risk reductions in the U300 group 
were found for the number (%) patients reporting nocturnal hypoglycaemia during the first 8 weeks 
of study treatment for nocturnal hypoglycaemia. 
During Month 3 to Month 6 (endpoint) of study treatment, all hypoglycaemia reported any time of the 
day and nocturnal hypoglycaemia were reported by overall comparable percentages of patients in the 
U300  and  Lantus  treatment  groups.  Analyses  of  the  hypoglycaemia  event  rate  per  patient-year 
exposure  show  numerically  higher  event  rates  in  the  U300  treatment  group  for  symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia documented by SMPG ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and, mostly driven by this category, 
for severe and/or confirmed hypoglycaemia.

hypoglycaemia by plasma glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) per patient during the 
6-month on-treatment period (Nelson-Aalen estimates)  
In all studies in T2DM, concomitant use of sulfonylureas was prohibited in order to not jeopardize the 
hypoglycaemia analyses by hypoglycaemia caused by sulfonylureas. In all 3 studies the percentage of 
patients  reporting  hypoglycaemia  of  any  category  was  numerically  lower  in  the  U300  groups 
compared  with  the  Lantus  groups;  severe  hypoglycaemia  and  asymptomatic  hypoglycaemia  with 
SMPG < 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) were reported by a similar percentage of patients. 
In study EFC11628 in patients using basal insulin in combination with mealtime insulin, event rates 
per patient-year exposure were comparable between the U300 and Lantus group for all categories of

hypoglycaemia. Relative risk vs Lantus for any hypoglycaemia was 0.94 (95% CI 0.80-1.11).  In the 
other T2DM studies, in patients using basal insulin in combination with non-insulin AHA, event rates 
per patient-year exposure were lower in the U300 group than in the Lantus group. Relative risk vs 
Lantus for any hypoglycaemia was 0.77 (95% CI 0.66-0.90). 
In all 3 studies in T2DM all types of nocturnal hypoglycaemia were reported by a lower percentage of 
patients in the U300 group compared with the Lantus group. Relative risk vs Lantus for any nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia was 0.76 (95% CI 0.66-0.87); comparable percentages of patients were found for 
asymptomatic  hypoglycaemia  with  SMPG  <3.0  mmol/L  (54  mg/dL)(RR  vs  Lantus  0.69  [95%  CI 
0.30-1.59]).  In  the  studies  in  T2DM,  daytime  hypoglycaemia  was  reported  by  a  similar  (in 
combination  with  mealtime  insulin)  or  lower  (in  combination  with  non-insulin  AHA)  percentage  of 
patients in the U300 compared with Lantus group depending on the type of hypoglycaemia.  
In all 3 studies the cumulative number of events was lower in the U300 group than in the Lantus group 
for  both  hypoglycaemia  any  time  of  the  day  and  nocturnal  hypoglycaemia  events.  Differences  in 
favour of U300 are most prominent for nocturnal hypoglycaemia in the studies in insulin-pretreated 
patients (EFC11628 and EFC11629) and for hypoglycaemia any time of the day in the 2 studies where 
the basal insulin was given in combination with non-insulin AHA (EFC11629 and EFC12347). Notably, 
any  separation  between  the  2  treatment  groups  starts  already  during  the  first  weeks  of  study 
treatment, ie, still in the transition period when changing over from another insulin regimen or in the 
first weeks of insulin treatment in insulin-naïve patients. 
In all 3 studies in T2DM, during the first 8 weeks of study treatment, hypoglycaemia events of all 
categories were reported by lower percentages of U300 than Lantus treated patients. During the first 
8 weeks of study treatment, nocturnal hypoglycaemia was reported by lower percentages of patients 
in the U300 group compared with the Lantus groups in all 3 studies in T2DM. During Month 3 to Month 
6  (endpoint)  of  study  treatment,  in  all  3  studies  in  T2DM,  hypoglycaemia  any  time  of  the  day 
continued to be reported by a lower percentage of patients and at a lower event rate per patient-year 
exposure in the U300 group than in the Lantus group. The risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, regardless 
if shown by percentage of patients reporting at least one event or by event rate per patient-year 
exposure continued to be lower in the U300 group compared with the Lantus group during this study 
period. 
During the 3-month administration substudies of studies EFC11628 and EFC11629 in patients with 
T2DM, hypoglycaemia events occurring any time of the day and nocturnal hypoglycaemia occurring 
between 00.00 and 05.59 hours, overall and for each category of hypoglycaemia, were reported by 
comparable  percentages  of  patients  in  the  U300  adaptable  dosing  interval  group  and  U300  fixed 
dosing interval group.  
In study EFC12456 in patients with T1DM, hypoglycaemia events occurring any time of the day and 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia occurring between 00.00 and 05.59 hours, overall and for each category of 
hypoglycaemia, were reported by comparable percentages of patients and at comparable rates per 
patient-year in the U300 morning and evening injection groups. In comparison with Lantus, event 
rates for hypoglycaemia occurring between 06.00 and 24.00 hours tended to be higher with U300 
than Lantus for both the morning and evening injection groups (events per patient-year exposure for 
severe and/or confirmed hypoglycaemia [SMPG ≤3.9 mmol/L; 70 mg/dL], morning injection group: 
U300 71.48, Lantus 62.90; evening injection U300 69.38, Lantus 64.23).  
In T1DM and T2DM, for hypoglycaemia analyses, similar results were observed across subgroups as 
defined  by  demographic  or  baseline  characteristics.  In  the  T2DM  studies,  the  hypoglycaemia 
incidence was consistently lower in the U300 group than the Lantus group or at least similar in all 
subgroups defined by age, race, gender, ethnicity, BMI, HbA1c level and duration of diabetes.

Adverse events of special interest 
Injection Site Reactions 
No  safety  signal  was  detected  for  injection  site  reaction  TEAEs  in  the  T1DM  and  T2DM  pools  for 
patients receiving U300 or Lantus. 
The number of patients reporting any injection site reactions was comparable between the treatment 
groups, 2.5% of the U300 treated patients and 2.8% of the Lantus treated patients reported injection 
site reactions (T1DM: U300: 8 patients [2.6%]; Lantus: 5 patients [ 1.6%] and in T2DM: U300: 30 
patients [2.4%]; Lantus: 39 patients [3.1%]) during the main 6-month study periods. 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
No  safety  signal  was  detected  for  hypersensitivity  reactions,  which  were  reported  by  comparable 
percentages of patients in the Phase 2/3 studies overall (U300 5.3% and Lantus 4.5%) and in the 
T1DM studies (U300 6.6% and Lantus 4.6%) and T2DM studies (U300 5.0% and Lantus 4.4%). The 
most common hypersensitivity reactions were rash in both the U300 (13 patients, 0.8%) and Lantus 
(7 patients [0.5%]) groups. 
Most events were reported as mild or moderate in intensity. The majority of patients recovered or 
improved while treatment was ongoing. 
Study treatment was discontinued in one Lantus treated patient with T2DM because of injection site 
rash. 
Malignancy 
No  safety  signal  was  detected  for  malignancy  TEAEs  in  the  T1DM  and  T2DM  pools  for  patients 
receiving U300 or Lantus . The number of cases was comparable between the treatment groups; U300: 
6 patients (0.4%) and Lantus: 10 patients (0.6%). 
Cardiovascular safety 
No CV safety signal was detected in the T1DM and T2DM pools for patients receiving U300 or Lantus. 
Events of the SOC Cardiac disorders were reported by comparable percentages of U300 and Lantus 
treated patients overall (U300 2.2% and Lantus 2.9%), in the T1DM studies (U300 1.0% and Lantus 
1.3%) and in the T2DM studies (U300 2.5% and Lantus 3.3%).  
The U300 clinical development program has not been designed to specifically assess the CV risk of 
U300, as the CV safety profile of the active ingredient insulin glargine has been established for Lantus. 
Major  CV  events  (MACE)  including  CV  death,  non-fatal  myocardial  infarction  and  non-fatal  stroke 
were identified by searching the AE and SAE data base using Standardized MedDRA Queries and PTs.  
The percentage of patients with any MACE identified by the data base search was low and comparable 
in the U300 (0.6%) and Lantus (1.0%) groups, and similarly in the T1DM (U300 0.3% and Lantus 
0.7%) and T2DM studies (U300 0.7% and Lantus 1.1%).

As AEs identified in this search may include events that are not MACE, a thorough medical review of 
all the potential MACE listed in the above table was done. MACE was confirmed in: 
•  T1DM in one U300 treated patient (sudden death with severe coronary artery disease with 
chest pain), 
•  T2DM in 6 U300 treated patients (3 CV deaths, 3 non-fatal MIs) and 9 Lantus treated patients 
(1 CV death, 3 non-fatal MIs and 5 non-fatal strokes). 
All  patients  experiencing  serious  cardiac  TEAEs,  including  MACE,  had  pre-existing,  event  related 
pathology. None of the events were considered as related to the IMP or NIMP by the Investigator. 
Hepatic safety 
No safety signal was detected for hepatic TEAEs on T1DM and T2DM pools for patients receiving U300 
or Lantus. 
Serious adverse event and deaths 
Overall, serious TEAEs were reported by 5.4% of the patients in both the U300 and Lantus groups, 
and by comparable percentages of U300 and Lantus patients in the T1DM studies (U300 5.9% and 
Lantus  7.2%)  and  T2DM  studies  (U300  5.2%  and  Lantus  5.0%),  with  no  single  event  driving  the 
results. 
The most common serious TEAE in the T1DM studies was hypoglycaemia (U300 3.0% and Lantus 
3.9%; T2DM: U300 <0.1%, Lantus 0.2%) and the most common in the T2DM studies was coronary 
artery disease (U300 0.2%, Lantus <0.1%); T1DM: U300 one event, no events on Lantus). The most 
common SOC with serious TEAEs were Cardiac disorders (U300 1.2% and Lantus 1.0%), mostly due 
to reports in the T2DM studies (U300 1.3%; Lantus 1.2%). All patients experiencing serious cardiac 
TEAEs had pre-existing, significant event related pathology, none of the events were considered as 
related to the IMP or NIMP by the Investigator.  
At the cut-off date of 29 October 2013, SAEs were reported during the ongoing extension periods of 
studies  EFC11628  (n=  68  patients),  EFC11629  (n=30  patients),  EFC12347  (n=11  patients)  and 
EFC12456 (n=12 patients). In the Japanese studies, SAEs were reported for 14 patients in EFC12449 
(Japan, T1DM), and 14 patients in EFC12512 (Japan, T2DM). 
No serious TEAEs were reported during the Phase 1 program. 
During the main 6-month study periods in the Phase 3 studies, serious TEAEs with fatal outcome were 
reported by a comparable percentage of patients in the U300 (5/1546, 0.3%) and Lantus (3/1550, 
0.2%) groups. In the studies in T1DM, the only TEAE with fatal outcome was reported in 1/304 (0.3%) 
patient in the U300 group (sudden death, coronary artery disease, chest pain). In the studies in T2DM, 
TEAEs with fatal outcome were reported in 4/1242 (0.3%) patients in the U300 group and 3/1246 
(0.2%)  patients  in  the  Lantus  group.  Causes  of  death  in  the  U300  group  included  bronchogenic 
carcinoma, possible myocardial infarction, sudden death in the course of coronary artery disease, and 
worsening  of  atherosclerotic  heart  disease.  In  the  Lantus  group  the  reported  fatal  TEAEs  were 
recurrent  depression  and  drug  overdose  (benzodiazepines),  judged  to  be  a  suicide,  concomitant 
Assessment report

worsening of chronic heart failure (NYHA IV), chronic kidney failure and decompensated diabetes, and 
exacerbation of chronic pyelonephritis. 
Adverse  events  with  fatal  outcome  were  reported  after  treatment  discontinuation  in  the  6-month 
study period in 2 patients in the U300 group, both in study EFC11628 (fatal septic thrombosis; fatal 
pulmonary embolism after total knee replacement). 
None of the serious TEAEs with fatal outcome were considered related to the IMP or non-IMP.  
At the time of the cut-off for the 6-month study reports, 2 deaths were reported in the extension 
periods, one in the Lantus group (acute cardiopulmonary arrest) and one in the U300 group (acute 
myocardial infarction). The event with fatal outcome in the U300 group was considered related to the 
IMP and non-IMP (metformin). 
No TEAEs with fatal outcome were reported in the Phase 1 studies, in the Phase 2 study and during the 
3-month administration substudy periods of the EFC11628 and EFC11629 studies. 
As of the dossier cut-off date of 29 October 2013, 4 patients had died in the ongoing safety extension 
periods  of  the  Phase  3  studies.  Causes  of  death  were  bronchopneumonia,  myocardial  infarction, 
oesophageal  adenocarcinoma  stage  IV  and  liver  cancer.  None  of  these  4 deaths  were  considered 
related to IMP by the Investigator. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory tests and vital signs did not reveal new or unexpected safety issues. Body weight 
increased more with Lantus than with U300, despite higher insulin use in the U300 group.

Safety in special populations 
The results of the subgroup analyses (age group, gender, race, ethnicity, baseline BMI categories, 
baseline eGFR categories, and hepatic disease ongoing at baseline) for common TEAEs were generally 
consistent with those for the overall population in the T1DM and T2DM pools.  
For the age group ≥65 to <75 years, the incidence of common TEAEs was similar in both treatment 
groups.  For  the  age  group  ≥75  years,  interpretation  was  limited  because  of  the  low  number  of 
patients in this subgroup; however, no safety signal was detected.  
Immunological events 
At baseline, a similar percentage of U300 and Lantus patients were positive for AIAs in T1DM (61.7% 
U300 and 53.6% Lantus) as well as T2DM (41.6% U300 and 37.7% Lantus). Throughout the main 
6-month  treatment  period,  the  percentage  of  AIA-positive  patients  slightly  increased  in  T1DM 
patients, in both the U300 and Lantus groups, and remained similar in all T2DM patients. Among the 
AIA-positive patients, the percentage of those with antibodies cross-reacting with human insulin was 
similar between treatment groups for T1DM and T2DM. No major differences over time or between 
treatment groups were observed for antibody titer.  
Percentages of patients with any TEAE tended to be higher for AIA-positive than negative patients in 
both, T1DM and T2DM, although the low denominator in the T1DM AIA-negative groups has to be 
taken into consideration. In T1DM, 50.9% of U300 and 48.3% of Lantus treated AIA-negative patients 
had any TEAE, compared with 65% of U300 and 61.3% of Lantus AIA-positive patients. Similarly in 
T2DM, in both, U300 and Lantus groups, the percentages of patients reporting any TEAEs was higher 
in  the  AIA-positive  groups  (U300  43.1%;  Lantus  40.3%)  compared  with  the  AIA-negative  groups 
(U300 36.6%; Lantus 35.5%), with no single event contributing to the larger number of patients with 
events. There was no difference in the percentages of patients reporting any TEAE in the high titer and 
low titer groups. 
Hypoglycaemia  events,  injection  site  reactions  and  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  reported  by 
similar percentages of AIA-positive and AIA-negative patients in T1DM and T2DM. 
These  data  suggest that  there  is  no  difference in  the  insulin  antibody  response  and  in  the  clinical 
effects associated with the insulin antibody formation in the U300 and Lantus groups. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The percentage of patients with TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was low and comparable 
between treatment groups overall (U300 1.4% and Lantus 1.2%), and in the studies in T1DM (U300 
1.3% and Lantus 1.0%) and T2DM (U300 1.4% and Lantus 1.3%). The pattern of TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation was similar in the U300 and Lantus groups, with no single event driving the results in 
either treatment group.  
Post marketing experience 
U300 has not been marketed in any country. 
The efficacy and safety of insulin glargine as 100 U/mL has been shown in more than 200 000 patients 
with  T1DM  or  T2DM  included  in  clinical  trials  and  observational  studies.  The benefit/risk  profile of 
insulin glargine as 100 U/mL is well-established. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Acknowledging the vast experience with Lantus, and the similarities between Lantus and U300, the 
Applicant’s approach to focus the safety evaluation on the differences between U100 and U300 was 
considered appropriate by CHMP. These would include the effects of the different PK/PD, which could 
Assessment report  
EMA/157145/2015  
Page 65/74 
 
 
 
lead to hypoglycaemia. On the other hand, local effects, including different immunogenicity, could be 
important. Accordingly, no new investigations on interactions were performed, which is acceptable. 
The documented exposure is sufficient, both in comparison to the guideline (ICH-E1) and taking into 
account  the  experience  with  Lantus.  In  the  initial  submission,  the  safety  database  included  1544 
patients exposed to U300, of whom 100 for at least 1 year. The extension phases were finalised by 
September 2014 and the safety data from the extensions of the T2DM trials were submitted during 
the procedure and included additionally 1011 patients exposed to U300 for at least 1 year.   No safety 
concerns did arise from these data. Data for EFC12456 study (T1DM) were not yet available, and will 
be provided post-approval. 
Hypoglycaemia rates with U300 were not higher than with Lantus. Most subjects who use Lantus have 
an evening injection. When this is compared to an injection with a similar amount of U300, this results 
for U300 in lower basal insulin levels during the night and higher basal insulin levels during the day. 
Accordingly,  for  U300  nocturnal  hypoglycaemia  events  were  somewhat  lower  and  daytime 
hypoglycaemia  events  were  higher  in  some  categories,  especially  in  combination  with  mealtime 
insulin. Most differences were small. The Applicant showed that mealtime insulin in combination with 
basal insulin contributes significantly to the increase in the number of daytime hypoglycaemia events. 
This  was  especially  obvious  in  T1DM,  with  more  hypoglycaemias in  the  U300 group.  In  T2DM  the 
differences in hypoglycaemia were in favour of U300. CHMP agreed with the Applicant that mealtime 
insulin doses could have been further optimised, in particular in T1DM patients. The review of “all 
hypoglycaemias” showed that, in the T1DM population, hypoglycaemia was reported by almost all 
patients.  This  is  in  line  with  data  from  other  studies  in  this  population.  Somewhat  more  severe 
hypoglycaemia events were reported with Lantus than with HOE901-U300. However, numbers are 
very small and thus no firm conclusions can be drawn. TEAEs were reported in 62.8% and 58.9% of 
U300 and Lantus treated patients respectively in T1DM studies, and in 57.3% and 53.7% of patients, 
respectively in T2DM studies. 5.1% of the U300 treated patients and 4.1% of the Lantus patients had 
an event of severe intensity; the most frequent in both groups being hypoglycaemia. A causal relation 
between events like nasopharyngitis (the most frequent AE) and PK/PD of insulin seems implausible. 
Rather, the difference between Lantus and U300 groups may be related to the open label design of the 
trials. 
No  safety  signal  was  detected  from  the  analysis  of  AEs  of  special  interest,  including  injection  site 
reactions,  hypersensitivity  reactions  and  cardiovascular  safety.  Also  analyses  of  serious  adverse 
events,  deaths  and  discontinuations  were unremarkable.  The  PK/PD  data,  however,  evoked  some 
concern  regarding  long-term  safety  with  regards  to  injection  site  reactions.  The  Applicant  has 
provided  adequate  data  explaining  the  apparent  difference  in  systemic  exposure.  These  data  in 
combination with the clinical safety data support keeping the current recommendation in the SmPC 
for rotation of the injection site. 
Laboratory  tests  and  vital  signs  did  not  reveal  new  or  unexpected  safety  issues.  Body  weight 
increased more with Lantus than with U300, despite higher insulin use in the U300 group. 
There is no difference in the insulin antibody response and in the clinical effects associated with the 
insulin antibody formation in the U300 and Lantus groups. 
Based  on  the  similarity  between  U300  and  Lantus,  no  new  analyses  of  interactions  are  deemed 
relevant. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of U300 is largely similar to that of Lantus and acceptable. Compared to Lantus the 
more stable basal insulin levels may lead to a reduction in hypoglycaemias in some situations.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits

Beneficial effects 
U300 in Toujeo is a new strength/potency of insulin glargine. It was proposed in a line extension to 
insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Optisulin). It has the same composition as the commercial formulation of 
insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Lantus, Optisulin) except for adjustment of 3 times the amount of active 
pharmaceutical ingredient and corresponding zinc content. The efficacy and safety of insulin glargine 
are well established.  
Insulin glargine has the same metabolism after SC injection regardless of its source. However, the 
U300 and U100 formulations are not bio-equivalent. The difference between U300 and Lantus (U100) 
comes  only  from  the  PK/PD  profiles  of  the  2  formulations  as  shown  in  the  Phase  1  PK/PD  clamp 
studies,  which  showed  a  flatter  and  more  prolonged  (up  to  36  hours)  profile  of  the  insulin 
concentration and glucose lowering activity of U300 compared with Lantus at the same doses. With 
this time-action profile, U300 was expected to provide a more constant 24-hour basal insulin supply 
when compared to Lantus). 
Figure 10 - TDR11626 - 36-hour mean smoothed glucose infusion rate profiles at steady 
state for 0.4 U/kg Lantus (dotted line) and 0.4 U/kg U300 (solid line) 
Efficacy of U300 was investigated in studies including a broad range of adult patients with T1DM and 
T2DM using different established anti-hyperglycaemic treatment approaches, including basal insulin 
in combination with mealtime insulin or basal insulin in combination with non-insulin AHA in patients 
with T2DM. 
Non-inferiority of U300 over Lantus on HbA1c change from baseline was shown in all Phase 3 studies 
with the upper bounds of the 95% CI below 0.185% which was well below the pre-specified margin of 
0.4%. 
The secondary endpoint of nocturnal severe and/or confirmed hypoglycaemia (SMPG ≤3.9 mmol/L 
(70 mg/dL)) during the night was in general similar between groups in T1DM and the 3 studies in 
T2DM, however, the percentages were lower in the U300 groups compared with the Lantus groups 
reaching statistical significance in the studies in insulin pre-treated patients with risk reductions of 
21% (study EFC11628: 36.1 vs 46.1%) and 23% (study EFC11629: 21.6 vs 27.9%).  
Data from the extension phases in the T2DM trials (12 months) showed that the effect on HbA1c is 
maintained over the 12 month period with only modest increase in insulin dose. The effect of U300 
remains  comparable  to  that  of  Lantus  but  with  a  lower  rate  of  hypoglycaemia  (and  especially 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia) in insulin-experienced patients. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Exploratory data in 3 months extensions show that occasional deviations from precise 24hour dosing 
is expected to be safe. The trial was relatively short and no power calculation was provided, making 
the findings uncertain. On theoretical grounds, occasional flexibility is expected to be safe.

Due to the higher concentration, the volume to be injected is smaller, which may be less painful.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety evaluation was based on 1544 patients exposed to U300, of whom 100 were exposed for 
at least 1 year. The analysis focused on hypoglycaemias and injection site issues, which is appropriate 
given the large similarities to Lantus. 
In  comparison  to  Lantus,  hypoglycaemias  occurred  somewhat  less  frequently  in  most  categories 
investigated. 
U300 was well tolerated and had a general safety profile, including injection site reactions, similar to 
the well-established safety profile of Lantus. The evaluation of systemic hypersensitivity reactions 
and AIAs suggest an immunogenic potential similar to Lantus. 
Data  on  immunogenicity  at  12  months  was  provided  with  the  submission  of  the  data  from  the 
extension phases for the pivotal T2DM studies that were finalised by September 2014. Antibodies 
against  insulin  were  detected  in  similar  proportions  of  patients  in  U300  and  Lantus  groups  at  12 
months. 
In all pharmacokinetic studies U300 was administered subcutaneously by injection in the periumbilical 
area of the abdomen. The SmPC recommends injection in the abdomen wall, the deltoid or the thigh.  
Data  from  the  clinical  phase  3  studies  was  provided  which  support  keeping  the  current 
recommendation in the SmPC for rotation of the injection site. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In order to obtain a similar effect on HbA1c, 10-18% higher doses of U300 than Lantus were given. 
The difference in dose between U300 and Lantus is consistent with the 17% lower 24-hour exposure 
of -U300 compared with Lantus at fixed, equal daily doses (0.4 U/kg) in steady-state conditions in the 
PK/PD study TDR11626. 
The  different  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  profiles  of  insulin  glargine  from  Lantus  and 
U300 are due to different absorption rates from the subcutaneous precipitate, the mechanism behind 
this difference remains unclear. Considering the lower systemic exposure also at steady state, it may 
be assumed that a higher proportion of U300 is either retained or degraded within the subcutaneous 
tissue which may be exposed to higher insulin levels than with Lantus. The Applicant has, however, 
provided adequate data explaining the apparent difference in systemic exposure. 
In their discussion, the Applicant suggested that mealtime insulin doses as used by the participants in 
the trial were not optimal, based on patterns of hypoglycaemia, variability of glucose measurements 
and possibly increase in total use of insulin.  Data indeed suggest that mealtime insulin contributes to 
the  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia.  The  difference  between  U300  and  Lantus  is  especially  obvious  in 
T1DM,  with  more  hypoglycaemias  in  the  U300  group,  whereas  in  T2DM  the  differences  in 
hypoglycaemia were in favour of U300.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In  many  aspects  U300  is  similar  to  Lantus.  There  is  extensive  experience  with  Lantus  and  the 
benefit/risk  of  Lantus  is  well-established.  The  similarity  with  Lantus  strongly  supported  the 
benefit/risk assessment. 
The  PK/PD  differences,  resulting  in  a  flatter  basal  insulin  curve,  could  be  considered  a  theoretical 
advantage. However, the clinical trials did not show major clinical advantages of this flatter profile.  In 
some  patients,  however,  a  reduction  in  hypoglycaemias  may  be  important,  and  thus  a  valuable 
additional therapeutic option. 
The reduction in injection volume could be of importance especially for patients who require large 
amounts of insulin. However, the limitation to 80 units per injection requires these patients to use still 
more than one injection, to some extent negating the most obvious advantage. 
The average increased dose of insulin up to 18% is a theoretical disadvantage when a switch is made 
from  100  U/ml  (Lantus)  to  U300.  It  is  consistent  with  the  lower  systemic  exposure.  It  has 
consequences for patients who switch from U300 to 100 U/ml insulin glargine as a dose reduction of 
20% with subsequent titration may be needed. The extended residence time of U300 insulin glargine 
did not result in clinically relevant differences in anti-insulin antibody titers. 
Although the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.4% is considered as too wide the actual upper 
limit was 0.185%, which is well below the more desired margin of 0.3%. 
U300  is  not  simply  interchangeable  with  other  long-acting  insulins,  including  100  U/ml  insulin 
glargine. Importantly, when switching between insulin glargine 100 U/ml and U300, different doses 
may be needed to achieve target ranges for plasma glucose levels giving rise to a potential risk of 
medication error. This risk is addressed both in advice given in the SmPC and as an additional risk 
minimisation measure in the form of educational material (brochure) for health care professional and 
patient.   
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of insulin glargine 300 U/ml is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Insulin  glargine  U300  has  flatter  PK/PD  characteristics  than  Lantus  and  is  not  bioequivalent  with 
insulin glargine 100 U/ml necessitating adaptation of the dose when a switch  is made. After dose 
titration  U300  has  demonstrated  comparable  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  to  Lantus  in  a  broad 
population  of  patients  with  T1DM  and  T2DM  with  different  pre-treatment  regimens  and  dose 
requirements of insulin.  
For T2DM there was a reduced risk for hypoglycaemia. In T1DM the only advantage is the reduction 
in injection volume. For patients who require more than 80 units of basal insulin, the volume but not 
the number of injections can be reduced. 
Conclusion 
The overall B/R of Toujeo, insulin glargine 300 units/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen is 
positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk/benefit balance of Toujeo 300 units/ml in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults is 
favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the extension of the marketing authorisation 
subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
• 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in 
accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) ) provided for 
under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and  published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product 
• 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required  pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the 
same time. 
• 
Prior  to  launch  of  Toujeo  300  units/ml  in  each  Member  State  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
(MAH) must agree the content and format of the educational programme, including communication 
media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects, with the National Competent Authority.  
The  MAH  shall  ensure  that  in  each  Member  State  where  Toujeo  300  units/ml  is  marketed,  all 
healthcare professionals (HCPs) who are expected to prescribe or dispense Toujeo 300 units/ml, as 
well as all patients or their carers who are expected to use Toujeo 300 units/ml, are provided with 
educational material to address the risk(s) of Medication error (switching between 100 units/ml and 
300 units/ml without dose adjustment).  
The educational materials for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
- 
That insulin glargine 100 units/ml and insulin glargine 300 units/ml (Toujeo 300 units/ml) are not 
bioequivalent and are therefore not interchangeable without dose adjustment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/157145/2015  
Page 73/74 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
That dose adjustment is needed when patients are switched from one to the other strength: 
After titration, on average a 10-18% higher basal insulin dose are needed to achieve target 
ranges for plasma glucose levels when using the 300 units/ml formulation compared to the 100 
units/ml formulation.  
- 
Switching from the 300 units/ml to the 100 units/ml concentration results in an increased risk of 
hypoglycaemic events, mainly in the first week after the switch. To reduce the risk of 
hypoglycaemia, patients who are changing their basal insulin regimen from an insulin regimen 
with once daily Toujeo 300 units/ml (insulin glargine 300 units/ml) to a once daily regimen with 
insulin glargine 100 units/ml should reduce their dose by 20%; 
-   When switching from a treatment regimen with an intermediate or long-acting insulin product to 
a regimen with Toujeo 300 units/ml, a change of the dose of the basal insulin may be required 
and the concomitant anti-hyperglycaemic treatment may need to be adjusted. Close metabolic 
monitoring is recommended during the switch and in the initial weeks thereafter; 
-  
Patients need to be instructed that insulin glargine 100 units/ml products and Toujeo 300 
units/ml are not interchangeable and dose adjustments need to be made; 
-   Blood glucose monitoring by patients is needed during the switch and the initial weeks 
thereafter; 
-   Reporting of medication errors or any side effects. 
The educational material for patients and/or carers to address the risk(s) of Medication error 
(switching between 100 units/ml and 300 units/ml without dose adjustment) shall contain the 
following key elements: 
- 
That insulin glargine 100 units/ml and insulin glargine 300 units/ml (Toujeo 300 units/ml) are not 
bioequivalent and are therefore not interchangeable without dose adjustment. 
-   That the switch from one insulin therapy to another should only be done when prescribed by their 
healthcare provider; 
-   That the dose newly recommended by their healthcare provider should always be followed; 
- 
That blood glucose need to be closely monitored during the switch and the initial weeks 
thereafter;  
- 
That they should consult their healthcare provider for further information; 
-   Reporting of medication errors or any side effects. 
The target audience and the modalities for distribution of all of these materials are to be agreed at 
Member State Level. The MAH shall agree the final text and the context of the educational material for 
HCPs and patients together with a communication plan, with the National Competent Authority in 
each Member State prior to launch of the medicinal product. 
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation(s) to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change:

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Pioglitazone is indicated as second or third line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as described 
below: 
as monotherapy 
- 
in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise 
for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as dual oral therapy in combination with 
- 
- 
metformin, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic 
control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin. 
a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom 
metformin is contraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated 
dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea. 
as triple oral therapy in combination with 
- 
metformin and a sulphonylurea, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with 
insufficient glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy. 
- 
Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus adult 
patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate 
because of contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4). 
After initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess 
adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an 
adequate response, pioglitazone should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged 
therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is 
maintained (see section 4.4). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Pioglitazone treatment may be initiated at 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. The dose may be increased in 
increments up to 45 mg once daily. 
In combination with insulin, the current insulin dose can be continued upon initiation of pioglitazone 
therapy. If patients report hypoglycaemia, the dose of insulin should be decreased. 
Special population 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Physicians should start 
treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually, particularly when 
pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and cardiac failure). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine 
clearance > 4 ml/min) (see section 5.2). No information is available from dialysed patients, therefore 
pioglitazone should not be used in such patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.3 and 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of pioglitazone in children and adolescents under 18 years of age have not 
been established. No data are available. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method of administration 
Pioglitazone tablets are taken orally once daily with or without food. Tablets should be swallowed 
with a glass of water. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients 
cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA stages I to IV) 
hepatic impairment 
diabetic ketoacidosis 
current bladder cancer or a history of bladder cancer 
uninvestigated macroscopic haematuria. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Fluid retention and cardiac failure 
Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure. When 
treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure (e.g. 
prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease or the elderly), physicians should 
start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually. Patients should be observed for 
signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema; particularly those with reduced cardiac 
reserve. There have been post-marketing cases of cardiac failure reported when pioglitazone was used 
in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure. Patients should be observed 
for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in 
combination with insulin. Since insulin and pioglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, 
concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. Post marketing cases of peripheral 
oedema and cardiac failure have also been reported in patients with concomitant use of pioglitazone 
and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Pioglitazone should 
be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs. 
A cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease. Pioglitazone or placebo was 
added to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years. This study showed an 
increase in reports of heart failure, however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study. 
Elderly 
Combination use with insulin should be considered with caution in the elderly because of increased 
risk of serious heart failure. 
In light of age-related risks (especially bladder cancer, fractures and heart failure), the balance of 
benefits and risks should be considered carefully both before and during treatment in the elderly. 
Bladder cancer 
Cases of bladder cancer were reported more frequently in a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials 
with pioglitazone (19 cases from 12506 patients, 0.15%) than in control groups (7 cases from 
10212 patients, 0.07%) HR=2.64 (95% CI 1.11-6.31, P=0.029). After excluding patients in whom 
exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 
7 cases (0.06%) on pioglitazone and 2 cases (0.02%) in control groups. Epidemiological studies have 
also suggested a small increased risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone, 
although not all studies identified a statistically significant increased risk. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors for bladder cancer should be assessed before initiating pioglitazone treatment (risks 
include age, smoking history, exposure to some occupational or chemotherapy agents 
e.g. cyclophosphamide or prior radiation treatment in the pelvic region). Any macroscopic haematuria 
should be investigated before starting pioglitazone therapy. 
Patients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician if macroscopic 
haematuria or other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment. 
Monitoring of liver function 
There have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience (see 
section 4.8). It is recommended, therefore, that patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic 
monitoring of liver enzymes. Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with 
pioglitazone in all patients. Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with 
increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 X upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence 
of liver disease. 
Following initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored 
periodically based on clinical judgement. If ALT levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal 
during pioglitazone therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible. If ALT 
levels remain > 3 X the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued. If any patient develops 
symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision 
whether to continue the patient on therapy with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical judgement 
pending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, the medicinal product should be discontinued. 
Weight gain 
In clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due 
to fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention. In some cases weight increase 
may be a symptom of cardiac failure, therefore weight should be closely monitored. Part of the 
treatment of diabetes is dietary control. Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a 
calorie-controlled diet. 
Haematology 
There was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin (4% relative reduction) and haematocrit (4.1% 
relative reduction) during therapy with pioglitazone, consistent with haemodilution. Similar changes 
were seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3–4% and haematocrit 3.6–4.1% relative reductions) and to a 
lesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin (haemoglobin 1–2% and haematocrit 1–3.2% relative 
reductions) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone. 
Hypoglycaemia 
As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral 
therapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related 
hypoglycaemia, and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary. 
Eye disorders 
Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual 
acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone. Many of these patients 
reported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association 
between pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular 
oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should 
be considered.

Others 
An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse reactions 
of bone fracture from randomised, controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and 
7400 comparator treated patients, on treatment for up to 3.5 years. 
Fractures were observed in 2.6% of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7% of women treated 
with a comparator. No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) 
versus comparator (1.5%). 
The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with 
pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator. The observed 
excess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per 
100 patient years of use. 
In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study, 44/870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) 
of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures 
per 100 patient years) of female patients treated with comparator. No increase in fracture rates was 
observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%). 
Some epidemiological studies have suggested a similarly increased risk of fracture in both men and 
women. 
The risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of patients treated with pioglitazone 
(see section 4.8). 
As a consequence of enhancing insulin action, pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic 
ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation. These patients may be at risk of pregnancy. 
Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if 
pregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6). 
Pioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 
inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Glycaemic control should be monitored 
closely. Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic 
treatment should be considered (see section 4.5). 
Pioglitazone Actavis tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics 
or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Co-administration of 
pioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea. 
Studies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450, 1A, 2C8/9 and 3A4. 
In vitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450. Interactions with 
substances metabolised by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel 
blockers, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected. 
Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported 
to result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone. Since there is a potential for an increase in 
dose-related adverse events, a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is 
concomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see 
section 4.4). Co-administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) 
is reported to result in a 54% decrease in AUC of pioglitazone. The pioglitazone dose may need to be 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control 
should be considered (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate human data to determine the safety of pioglitazone during pregnancy. Foetal 
growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone. This was attributable to the action 
of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that 
occurs during pregnancy, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth. 
The relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and pioglitazone should not be used in 
pregnancy. 
Breastfeeding 
Pioglitazone has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether 
pioglitazone is secreted in human milk. Therefore, pioglitazone should not be administered to 
breast-feeding women. 
Fertility 
In animal fertility studies there was no effect on copulation, impregnation or fertility index.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pioglitazone Actavis has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive and use machines. However 
patients who experience visual disturbance should be cautious when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Adverse reactions reported in excess (> 0.5%) of placebo and as more than an isolated case in patients 
receiving pioglitazone in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system 
organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common 
(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare 
(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing incidence and seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
1 Postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with pioglitazone have been 
reported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria.  
2 Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood 
glucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other 
hypoglycaemic treatments.

3 In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was 
the same as in placebo, metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups, but was increased when used 
in combination therapy with insulin. In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major 
macrovascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6% higher with pioglitazone than 
with placebo, when added to therapy that included insulin. However, this did not lead to an increase in 
mortality in this study. In this study in patients receiving pioglitazone and insulin, a higher percentage 
of patients with heart failure was observed in patients  aged ≥65 years compared with those less than 
65 years (9.7% compared to 4.0%). In patients on insulin with no pioglitazone the incidence of heart 
failure was 8.2% in those ≥65 years compared to 4.0% in patients less than 65 years. Heart failure has 
been reported with marketing use of pioglitazone, and more frequently when pioglitazone was used in 
combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure. 
4 A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse reactions of bone fractures from randomised, 
comparator controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated 
groups and 7400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration. A higher rate of 
fractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone (2.6%) versus comparator (1.7%). No increase in 
fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) versus comparator (1.5%). 
In the 3.5 year PROactive study, 44/870 (5.1%) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced 
fractures compared to 23/905 (2.5%) of female patients treated with comparator. No increase in 
fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%). Post-
marketing, bone fractures have been reported in both male and female patients (see section 4.4). 
5 Oedema was reported in 6–9% of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled 
clinical trials. The oedema rates for comparator groups (sulphonylurea, metformin) were 2–5%. The 
reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of 
treatment. 
6 In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy 
was 2–3 kg over one year. This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group. In 
combination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean weight increase over one year of 
1.5 kg and added to a sulphonylurea of 2.8 kg. In comparator groups, addition of sulphonylurea to 
metformin resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of metformin to a sulphonylurea a 
mean weight loss of 1.0 kg. 
7 In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the 
upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea 
comparator groups. Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone. Rare 
cases of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction have occurred in post-marketing 
experience. Although in very rare cases fatal outcome has been reported, causal relationship has not 
been established. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical studies, patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of 
45 mg daily. The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/day for four days, then 180 mg/day for seven 
days was not associated with any symptoms. 
Hypoglycaemia may occur in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin. Symptomatic and general 
supportive measures should be taken in case of overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. insulins; 
ATC code: A10BG03. 
Pioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance. Pioglitazone appears to act 
via activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) leading 
to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals. Treatment with 
pioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose 
disposal in the case of insulin resistance. 
Fasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The 
improved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma 
insulin concentrations. A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to 
two years in order to assess time to treatment failure (defined as appearance of HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the 
first six months of therapy). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients 
treated with gliclazide, compared with pioglitazone. At two years, glycaemic control (defined as 
HbA1c < 8.0%) was sustained in 69% of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 50% of 
patients on gliclazide. In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with 
gliclazide when added to metformin, glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in 
HbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year. The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during 
the second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide. 
In a placebo controlled trial, patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin 
optimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months. Patients receiving 
pioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45% compared with those continuing on insulin 
alone, and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group. 
HOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin 
sensitivity. Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect. 
In one year clinical trials, pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the 
albumin/creatinine ratio compared to baseline. 
The effect of pioglitazone (45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo) was studied in a small 18-week trial in 
type 2 diabetics. Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain. Visceral fat was 
significantly decreased, while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass. Similar changes in 
body fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity. 
In most clinical trials, reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased 
HDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo, with small, but not clinically 
significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels. 
In clinical trials of up to two years duration, pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free 
fatty acids, and increased HDL cholesterol levels, compared with placebo, metformin or gliclazide. 
Pioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with 
placebo, whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide. In a 20-week study, as well 
as reducing fasting triglycerides, pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an 
effect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides. These effects were independent of 
pioglitazone’s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significant different to glibenclamide. 
In PROactive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
pre-existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to 
existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3.5 years. The study population had an 
average age of 62 years; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years. Approximately one third of 
patients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and/or a sulphonylurea. To be eligible 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients had to have had one or more of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous 
cardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, 
or peripheral arterial obstructive disease. Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial 
infarction and approximately 20% had had a stroke. Approximately half of the study population had at 
least two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria. Almost all subjects (95%) were receiving 
cardiovascular medicinal products (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium 
channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, fibrates). 
Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint, which was a composite of all-cause 
mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, major leg amputation, 
coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation, the results suggest that there are no long-term 
cardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone. However, the incidences of oedema, weight 
gain and heart failure were increased. No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
pioglitazone in all subsets of the paediatric population in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. See section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration, pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations of 
unchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration. Proportional increases of 
the plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2-60 mg. Steady state is achieved after 
4-7 days of dosing. Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites. 
Absorption is not influenced by food intake. Absolute bioavailability is greater than 80%. 
Distribution 
The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 l/kg. 
Pioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein (> 99%). 
Biotransformation 
Pioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups. 
This is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser 
degree. Three of the six identified metabolites are active (M-II, M-III, and M-IV). When activity, 
concentrations and protein binding are taken into account, pioglitazone and metabolite M-III 
contribute equally to efficacy. On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold 
that of pioglitazone, whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal. 
In vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450. 
There is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A, 2C8/9, and 3A4 in man. 
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics 
or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Concomitant 
administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) or with 
rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to increase or decrease, respectively, the 
plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5). 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Following oral administration of radiolabelled pioglitazone to man, recovered label was mainly in 
faeces (55%) and a lesser amount in urine (45%). In animals, only a small amount of unchanged 
pioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces. The mean plasma elimination half-life of 
unchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours. 
Elderly 
Steady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects. 
Patients with renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment, plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower 
than those seen in subjects with normal renal function, but oral clearance of parent substance is 
similar. Thus free (unbound) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Total plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged, but with an increased volume of distribution. 
Intrinsic clearance is therefore reduced, coupled with a higher unbound fraction of pioglitazone. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In toxicology studies, plasma volume expansion with haemodilution, anaemia, and reversible eccentric 
cardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. 
In addition, increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed. These findings were observed 
across species at plasma concentrations ≤ 4 times the clinical exposure. Foetal growth restriction was 
apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone. This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in 
diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during 
pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth. 
Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro 
genotoxicity assays. An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and females) and tumours (males) 
of the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years. 
The formation and presence of urinary calculi with subsequent irritation and hyperplasia was 
postulated as the mechanistic basis for the observed tumourigenic response in the male rat. A 
24-month mechanistic study in male rats demonstrated that administration of pioglitazone resulted in 
an increased incidence of hyperplastic changes in the bladder. Dietary acidification significantly 
decreased but did not abolish the incidence of tumours. The presence of microcrystals exacerbated the 
hyperplastic response but was not considered to be the primary cause of hyperplastic changes. The 
relevance to humans of the tumourigenic findings in the male rat cannot be excluded. 
There was no tumorigenic response in mice of either sex. Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was not 
seen in dogs or monkeys treated with pioglitazone for up to 12 months. 
In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other 
thiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon. The relevance of this finding is 
unknown. 
Environmental Risk Assessment: no environmental impact is anticipated from the clinical use of 
pioglitazone.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pioglitazone Actavis is and what it is used for 
Pioglitazone Actavis contains pioglitazone. It is an anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 
(non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus, when metformin is not suitable or has failed to work 
adequately. This is the diabetes that usually develops in adulthood. 
Pioglitazone Actavis helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by 
helping your body make better use of the insulin it produces. Your doctor will check whether 
Pioglitazone Actavis is working 3 to 6 months after you start taking it. 
Pioglitazone Actavis may be used on its own in patients who are unable to take metformin, and where 
treatment with diet and exercise has failed to control blood sugar or may be added to other therapies 
(such as metformin, sulphonylurea or insulin) which have failed to provide sufficient control of blood 
sugar. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Pioglitazone Actavis  
Do not take Pioglitazone Actavis 
- 
if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients of Pioglitazone 
Actavis (see section 6 for a list of ingredients). 
if you have heart failure or have had heart failure in the past. 
if you have liver disease. 
if you have had diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes causing rapid weight loss, 
nausea or vomiting). 
if you have or have ever had bladder cancer. 
if you have blood in your urine that your doctor has not checked.

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you start to take this medicine: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you retain water (fluid retention) or have heart failure problems and in particular if you are 
over 75 years old. If you take anti-inflammatory medicines which can also cause fluid retention 
and swelling, you must also tell your doctor. 
if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back 
of the eye). 
if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovary syndrome). There may be an increased 
possibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take Pioglitazone 
Actavis. If this applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an 
unplanned pregnancy. 
if you have a problem with your liver or heart. Before you start taking Pioglitazone Actavis you 
will have a blood sample taken to check your liver function. This check may be repeated at 
intervals. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or 
previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of 
heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such 
as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you take Pioglitazone Actavis with other medicines for diabetes, it is more likely that your blood 
sugar could fall below the normal level (hypoglycaemia). 
You may also experience a reduction in blood count (anaemia). 
Broken bones 
A higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. Your 
doctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes. 
Children and adolescents 
Use in children under 18 years is not recommended. 
Other medicines and Pioglitazone Actavis 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
You can usually continue to take other medicines whilst you are being treated with Pioglitazone 
Actavis. However, certain medicines are especially likely to affect the amount of sugar in your blood: 
- 
- 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your blood sugar will be checked, and 
your dose of Pioglitazone Actavis may need to be changed. 
gemfibrozil (used to lower cholesterol) 
rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) 
Pioglitazone Actavis with food and drink 
You may take your tablets with or without food. You should swallow the tablets with a glass of water. 
Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Your doctor will advise you to discontinue this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Pioglitazone will not affect your ability to drive or use machines but take care if you experience 
abnormal vision. 
Pioglitazone Actavis contains lactose monohydrate 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking Pioglitazone Actavis.

3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Nebuliser solution. 
A clear to slightly yellow solution. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Vantobra is indicated for the management of chronic pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 
patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF).  
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The dose of Vantobra is the same for all patients within the approved age range, regardless of age or weight. 
The recommended dose is one ampoule (170 mg/1.7 ml) administered twice daily (i.e. total daily dose is 2 
ampoules) for 28 days. The dose interval should be as close as possible to 12 hours and not less than 6 hours.  
Vantobra is taken in alternating cycles of 28 days. A cycle of 28 days of active therapy (on-treatment period) 
and 28 days of rest from treatment (off-treatment period) should be maintained. 
Missed doses 
In case of a missed dose with at least 6 hours remaining until the next dose, the patient should inhale the dose 
as soon as possible. If less than 6 hours remain to the next planned dose, the patient should wait for the next 
dose and not inhale more to make up for the missed dose. 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment should be continued on a cyclical basis for as long as the physician considers the patient is gaining 
clinical benefit from the treatment taking into account that long-term safety data are not available for 
Vantobra. If clinical deterioration of pulmonary status is evident, additional or alternative anti-pseudomonal 
therapy should be considered. See also information on clinical benefit and tolerability in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 
5.1. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients (≥65 years) 
There are insufficient data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose adjustment.

Renal impairment 
There are no data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose adjustment with Vantobra. 
Please also refer to nephrotoxicity information in section 4.4 and excretion information in section 5.2. 
Hepatic impairment 
No studies have been performed on patients with hepatic impairment. As tobramycin is not metabolised, an 
effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure to tobramycin is not expected. 
Patients after organ transplantation 
Adequate  data  do  not  exist  for  the  use  of  inhaled  tobramycin  in  patients  after  organ  transplantation.  No 
recommendation for or against dose adjustment can be made for patients after organ transplantation. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Vantobra in children below 6 years of age.  
Method of administration  
Inhalation use. 
Vantobra is administered by inhalation using the Tolero nebuliser handset provided in the pack. For detailed 
instructions on use see section 6.6. 
Vantobra must not be administered by any other route or using any other device than the one provided in the 
pack.  The  use of  an  alternative  untested nebuliser  system  may  alter  the  pulmonary  deposition  of the  active 
substance. And this in turn may alter efficacy and safety of the product. 
Where patients are receiving several inhaled medicinal products and chest physiotherapy, it is recommended 
that Vantobra is used last.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance and any aminoglycoside or to any of the excipients listed in section 
6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Ototoxicity 
Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory toxicity (hearing loss) and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with 
parenteral  aminoglycosides.  Vestibular  toxicity  may  be  manifested by vertigo, ataxia  or dizziness.  Tinnitus 
may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants caution.  
Auditory toxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, was observed with 
parenteral aminoglycosides and may be considered also for the inhalation route of administration. In open label 
studies and post-marketing experience, some patients with a history of prolonged previous or concomitant use 
of intravenous aminoglycosides have experienced hearing loss. Physicians should consider the potential for 
aminoglycosides to cause vestibular and cochlear toxicity and carry out appropriate assessments of auditory 
function during Vantobra therapy.  
In  patients  with  a predisposing  risk  due  to previous  prolonged  systemic  aminoglycoside  therapy  it  may  be 
necessary to consider audiological assessment before initiating Vantobra therapy. If a patient reports tinnitus 
or hearing loss during aminoglycoside therapy, the physician should consider referring them for audiological 
assessment. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There  is  an  increased  risk  of  ototoxicity  in  patients  with  mitochondrial  DNA  mutations  (particularly  the 
nucleotide 1555 A to G substitution in the 12S rRNA gene), even if aminoglycoside serum levels are within 
the recommended range during treatment. Alternative treatment options should be considered in such patients.  
In  patients  with  a  maternal  history  of  relevant  mutations  or  aminoglycoside  induced  deafness,  alternative 
treatments or genetic testing prior to administration, should be considered. 
Nephrotoxicity 
Nephrotoxicity  has  been  associated  with  parenteral  aminoglycoside  therapy.  There  was  no  evidence  of 
nephrotoxicity during clinical trials with inhaled tobramycin and Vantobra. Caution should be exercised when 
prescribing  Vantobra  to  patients  with  known  or  suspected  renal  dysfunction.  According  to  current  clinical 
practice baseline renal function should be assessed. Urea and creatinine levels should be reassessed after every 
6 complete cycles of Vantobra therapy (180 days of nebulised aminoglycoside therapy).  
Monitoring of serum tobramycin concentrations 
Patients  with  known or  suspected  auditory or  renal  dysfunction  should  be  monitored  for  serum  tobramycin 
concentrations. If oto- or nephrotoxicity occurs in a patient receiving Vantobra, tobramycin therapy should be 
discontinued until serum concentration falls below 2 µg/ml. 
Serum concentrations greater than 12 µg/ml are associated with tobramycin toxicity and treatment should be 
discontinued if concentrations exceed this level. 
The serum concentration of tobramycin should only be monitored using validated methods. Finger prick blood 
sampling is not recommended due to the risk of contamination of the sample. 
Bronchospasm 
Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of medicinal products and has been reported with the use of nebulised 
tobramycin. Bronchospasm should be treated as medically appropriate. 
The first dose of Vantobra should be used under supervision of a physician, after taking a bronchodilator if this 
is part of the current regimen for the patient. FEV1 should be measured before and after nebulisation.  
If  there  is  evidence  of  therapy-induced bronchospasm,  the physician  should  carefully  evaluate  whether  the 
benefits of continued use of Vantobra outweighs the risks to the patient. If an allergic response is suspected, 
Vantobra should be discontinued.  
Neuromuscular disorders 
Vantobra should be used with great caution in patients with neuromuscular disorders such as Parkinsonism or 
other conditions characterized by myasthenia, including myasthenia gravis, as aminoglycosides may aggravate 
muscle weakness due to a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. 
Haemoptysis 
Inhalation  of  nebulised  tobramycin  solutions  may  induce  a  cough  reflex.  The  treatment  with  Vantobra  in 
patients with active, severe haemoptysis should be initiated only if the benefits of treatment are considered to 
outweigh the risks of inducing further haemorrhage. 
Development of resistance 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  development  of  antibiotic-resistant  P.  aeruginosa  and  superinfection  with  other  pathogens  represent 
potential risks associated with antibiotic therapy. Development of resistance during inhaled tobramycin therapy 
could limit treatment options during acute exacerbations; this should be monitored. 
Other precautions 
Patients receiving concomitant parenteral aminoglycoside therapy (or any medicine affecting renal excretion, 
such  as  diuretics)  should  be  monitored  as  clinically  appropriate  taking  into  account  the  risk  of  cumulative 
toxicity. This includes monitoring of serum concentrations of tobramycin.  
Safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients colonised with Burkholderia cepacia. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No  interaction  studies  have  been  performed.  Based  on  the  interaction  profile  for  tobramycin  following 
intravenous and aerosolised administration, concurrent and/or sequential use of Vantobra is not recommended 
with other medicinal products with nephrotoxic or ototoxic potential, such as: 
- 
- 
amphotericin B, cefalotin, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, polymyxins (risk of increased nephrotoxicity); 
platinum compounds (risk of increased nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity);   
Concurrent use of Vantobra with diuretic compounds (such as ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea or mannitol) 
is  not  recommended.  Such  compounds  can  enhance  aminoglycoside  toxicity  by  altering  antibiotic 
concentrations in serum and tissue (see section 4.4). 
Other medicinal products that have been reported to increase the potential toxicity of parenterally administered 
aminoglycosides include: 
- 
anticholinesterases, botulinum toxin (neuromuscular effects). 
In clinical studies patients using inhaled tobramycin continued to take dornase alfa, bronchodilators, inhaled 
corticosteroids and macrolides. No evidence of drug interactions with these medicines was identified. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the parenteral use of tobramycin in pregnant women. There are no adequate data 
from the use of tobramycin administered by inhalation in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate a 
teratogenic  effect  of  tobramycin  (see  section  5.3).  However,  aminoglycosides  can  cause  foetal  harm  (e.g., 
congenital deafness and nephrotoxicity) when high systemic concentrations are achieved in a pregnant woman. 
Systemic exposure following inhalation of Vantobra is very low (see section 5.2). If Vantobra is used during 
pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Vantobra, she should be informed of the potential 
hazard to the foetus.  
Vantobra should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefits to the mother outweigh the risks to the foetus 
or baby. 
Breast-feeding 
Tobramycin  is  excreted  in  human  breast  milk  after  systemic  administration.  The  amount  of  tobramycin 
excreted in human breast milk after administration by inhalation is not known, though it is estimated to be very 
low  considering  the  low  systemic  exposure.  Because  of  the  potential  for  ototoxicity  and  nephrotoxicity  in 
infants, a decision should be made whether to terminate breast-feeding or discontinue treatment with Vantobra, 
taking into account the importance of the treatment to the mother. 
Fertility 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No effect on male or female fertility was observed in animal studies after subcutaneous administration (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Vantobra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In controlled clinical trials with Vantobra the most frequent adverse reactions in cystic fibrosis patients with 
P.  aeruginosa  infection  were  cough  and  dysphonia.  Other  clinical trials  with  tobramycin  nebuliser  solution 
mention dysphonia and tinnitus as the most frequent undesirable events that were reported in significantly more 
patients compared to those treated with placebo. The episodes of tinnitus were transient and resolved without 
discontinuation of tobramycin therapy.  
In open label studies and post-marketing experience, some patients with a history of prolonged previous or 
concomitant use of intravenous aminoglycosides have experienced hearing loss. Parenteral aminoglycosides 
have been associated with hypersensitivity, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see section 4.4). 
Long-term safety data are not available for Vantobra (see also sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Reporting  suspected  adverse  reactions  after  authorisation  of  the  medicinal  product  is  important.  It  allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Administration  by  inhalation  results  in  low  systemic  bioavailability  of  tobramycin.  Symptoms  of  aerosol 
overdose may include severe hoarseness. 
In the event of accidental ingestion of Vantobra, toxicity is unlikely as tobramycin is poorly absorbed from an 
intact gastrointestinal tract. 
In  the  event  of  inadvertent  administration  of  Vantobra  by  the  intravenous  route,  signs  and  symptoms  of 
parenteral  tobramycin  overdose  may  occur,  including  dizziness,  tinnitus,  vertigo,  loss  of  hearing  acuity, 
respiratory distress and/or neuromuscular blockage and renal impairment. 
Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of Vantobra and baseline tests of renal function 
should be undertaken. Assessment of tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdose. 
In the case of any overdose, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in the elimination of Vantobra 
or other medicinal products should be considered. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, Aminoglycoside antibacterials.  
ATC code: J01GB01 
Mechanism of action 
Tobramycin  is  an  aminoglycoside  antibiotic  produced  by  Streptomyces  tenebrarius.  It  acts  primarily  by 
disrupting protein synthesis leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell 
envelope and eventual cell death. It is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory 
concentrations. 
Breakpoints 
Established  susceptibility  breakpoints  for  parenteral  administration  of  tobramycin  are  inappropriate  in  the 
aerosolised administration of the medicinal product. Sputum of cystic fibrosis patients exhibits an inhibitory 
action on the local biological activity of nebulised aminoglycosides. This necessitates sputum concentrations 
following treatment with aerosolised tobramycin to be ten to twentyfive-fold above the Minimum Inhibitory 
Concentration  (MIC)  for  both  P.  aeruginosa  growth  suppression  and  control  of  bactericidal  activity.  In 
controlled  clinical  trials,  97%  of  patients  receiving  tobramycin  nebuliser  solution  achieved  sputum 
concentrations  10-fold  of  the  highest  P.  aeruginosa  MIC  cultured  from  the  patient  and  95%  of  patients 
receiving tobramycin nebuliser solution achieved 25-fold of the highest MIC.  
Susceptibility 
In  the  absence of  conventional  susceptibility  breakpoints  for  the  nebulised  route  of  administration,  caution 
must be exercised in defining organisms as susceptible or insusceptible to nebulised tobramycin. 
In clinical studies with TOBI, most patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs < 128 µg/ml at 
baseline showed improved lung function following treatment with TOBI. Patients with a P. aeruginosa isolate 
with MIC  128 µg/ml at baseline are less likely to show a clinical response. However, seven of 13 patients 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(54%) in the placebo-controlled trials who acquired isolates with MICs of  128 µg/ml while using TOBI had 
improvement in pulmonary function. 
Based upon in-vitro data and/or clinical trial experience, the organisms associated with pulmonary infections 
in CF may be expected to respond to Vantobra therapy as follows: 
Susceptible 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
Haemophilus influenzae 
Staphylococcus aureus 
Insusceptible 
Burkholderia cepacia 
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 
Alcaligenes xylosoxidans 
Treatment  with  the  28-days  on  and  28-days  off  dose  regimen  in  clinical  studies  showed  a  small  but  clear 
increase in tobramycin, amikacin and gentamicin MICs for P. aeruginosa isolates tested. Each additional 6 
months of treatment resulted in incremental increases similar in magnitude to that observed in the 6 months of 
controlled studies. The most prevalent aminoglycoside resistance mechanism seen in P. aeruginosa isolated 
from  chronically  infected  CF  patients  is  impermeability,  defined  by  a  general  lack  of  susceptibility  to  all 
aminoglycosides.  P.  aeruginosa  isolated  from  CF  patients  has  also  been  shown  to  exhibit  adaptive 
aminoglycoside resistance that is characterised by a reversion to susceptibility when the antibiotic is removed. 
Other information 
There is no evidence that patients treated with up to 18 months with tobramycin nebuliser solution were at a 
greater risk for acquiring B. cepacia, S. maltophilia or A. xylosoxidans, than would be expected in untreated 
patients.  Aspergillus  species  were  more  frequently  recovered  from the  sputum  of  treated patients; however, 
clinical  sequelae  such  as  Allergic  Bronchopulmonary  Aspergillosis  (ABPA)  were  reported  rarely  and  with 
similar frequency as in the control group.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Limited data from one controlled clinical study over one treatment cycle indicate that the improvement in lung 
function was maintained above baseline during the 28-day off-treatment period. 
As a result of study 12012.101, lung function improvement FEV1% predicted relative to baseline increased by 
8.2 ± 9.4% under Vantobra and by 4.8 ± 9.6% under the reference therapy in the first treatment cycle showing

non-inferior  (p=0.0005)  efficacy.  CFU  reduction  as  an  indicator  for  suppression  of  P.  aeruginosa  was 
comparable for Vantobra and the reference product. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption and distribution 
The systemic exposure to tobramycin after inhalation of Vantobra is expected to emerge primarily from the 
inhaled  portion  of  the  medicinal  product  as  tobramycin  is  not  absorbed  to  any  appreciable  extent  when 
administered via the oral route. Inhalation of nebulised tobramycin produces high sputum concentrations and 
low plasma levels.  
For comparative aerosol data please refer to Table 2 in section 5.1  
At  the  end  of  a  4-weeks  dosing  cycle  of  Vantobra  (170  mg/1.7  ml  twice  daily)  in  cystic  fibrosis  patients, 
maximum tobramycin plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 1.27 ± 0.81 µg/ml were reached at approximately one 
hour after inhalation. Sputum concentrations were higher and more variable with Cmax of 1,951 + 2,187 µg/g. 
After administering a single dose of Vantobra 170 mg to healthy volunteers Cmax of 1.1 + 0.4 µg/ml were 
reached after a tmax of approximately 4 hours. 
Distribution 
Less than 10% of tobramycin is bound to plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation 
Tobramycin is not metabolised and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. 
Elimination 
The elimination of tobramycin administered by the inhalation route has not been studied. 
Following intravenous administration, systemically absorbed tobramycin is eliminated by glomerular filtration. 
The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 hours.  
Unabsorbed  tobramycin  following  administration  by  inhalation  is  probably  eliminated  primarily  in 
expectorated sputum. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical  data  reveal  that  the  main  hazard  for  humans,  based  on  conventional  studies  of  safety 
pharmacology,  repeated dose toxicity,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenic  potential  and  toxicity  to  reproduction  and 
development, consists of renal toxicity and ototoxicity. In repeated dose toxicity studies it has been shown that 
target organs of toxicity are the kidneys and vestibular/cochlear functions. In general, toxicity is seen at higher 
systemic tobramycin levels than are achievable by inhalation of the recommended clinical dose. 
No  reproduction  toxicology  studies  have  been  conducted  with  tobramycin  administered  by  inhalation. 
Subcutaneous  administration  at  doses  of  100 mg/kg/day  in  rats  and  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  of  20 
mg/kg/day in rabbits during organogenesis was not teratogenic. Teratogenicity could not be assessed at higher 
parenteral doses in rabbits as they induced maternal toxicity and abortion. Based on available data from animals 
a risk of toxicity (e.g. ototoxicity) at prenatal exposure levels cannot be excluded. Tobramycin did not impair 
fertility in male or female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 100 mg/kg/day.

Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, or pharmacist. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if 
their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Vantobra is and what it is used for 
What Vantobra is 
Vantobra contains an antibiotic medicine called tobramycin. It belongs to a class of antibiotic medicines called 
aminoglycosides. 
What Vantobra is used for 
Vantobra  is  used  in  patients  with  cystic  fibrosis  aged  6  years  and  older  to  treat  lung  infections  caused  by 
bacteria named Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is  a bacterium  that  frequently  infects the  lungs of  cystic  fibrosis  patients  at  some 
time during their lives. If the infection is not properly treated, it continues to damage the lungs, causing further 
problems with breathing. 
How Vantobra works 
When you inhale Vantobra, the antibiotic can enter directly into your lungs to fight the bacteria causing the 
infection. It works by disrupting the production of proteins that the bacteria need to build their cell walls. 
This damages the bacteria and eventually kills them. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Vantobra 
Do not use Vantobra: 
• 
if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to tobramycin, to any type of aminoglycoside antibiotics, or to any of 
the other ingredients of Vantobra (listed in section 6). 
If this applies to you, tell your doctor before using Vantobra. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor if you have ever had any of the following conditions: 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  hearing problems (including noises in your ears and dizziness); 
•  kidney problems; 
• 
chest tightness; 
•  blood in your sputum (the substance you cough up); 
•  muscle weakness that lasts or becomes worse over time, a symptom mostly related to conditions such as 
myasthenia (muscle weakness) or Parkinson’s disease. 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before using Vantobra. 
If you have problems with your hearing or kidney function, your doctor may take blood samples to monitor 
the amount of Vantobra in your system. 
If you or your maternal family members have a mitochondrial mutation disease (a genetic condition) or loss of 
hearing due to antibiotic medicines, you are advised to inform your doctor or pharmacist before you take this 
medicine; certain mitochondrial mutations may increase your risk of hearing loss with this product. Your doctor 
may recommend genetic testing before administration of Vantobra. 
Inhaling  medicines  can  cause  chest  tightness  due  to  narrowing  of  the  airways,  and  this  can  happen  with 
Vantobra.  Your  doctor  may  ask  you  to  use other  appropriate  medicines to  widen  the  airways before  using 
Vantobra. 
Strains  of  Pseudomonas  can  become  resistant  to  treatment  with  an  antibiotic  over  time.  This  means  that 
Vantobra may not work as well as it should over time. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned about this. 
If you are also taking tobramycin or another aminoglycoside antibiotic by injection, it may increase the risk of 
side effects and your doctor will monitor for these as appropriate. 
Children  
The medicine is not intended for use in children under 6 years of age. 
Other medicines and Vantobra 
Tell  your  doctor  or  a  pharmacist  if  you  are  taking  or  have  recently  taken  any  other  medicines,  including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. 
furosemide, a diuretic (“water tablet”); 
You should not take the following medicines while you are using Vantobra: 
• 
•  other medicines with diuretic potential such as urea or mannitol; 
•  other medicines which may harm your kidneys or hearing:  
o  amphotericin B, cefalotin, polymyxins (used to treat microbial infections), ciclosporin, tacrolimus 
(used to reduce the activity of immune system). These medicines may harm the kidneys;  
o  platinum compounds such as carboplatin and cisplatin (used to treat some forms of cancer). These 
medicines may harm the kidneys or hearing. 
The following medicines can increase the risks of harmful effects occurring if they are given to you while you 
also take tobramycin or another aminoglycoside antibiotic given by injection: 
• 
anticholinesterases such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine (used to treat muscle weakness), or botulinum 
toxin. These medicines may cause muscle weakness to appear or become worse. 
If you are taking one or more of the above medicines, talk to your doctor before you use Vantobra. 
You  should  not  mix or  dilute Vantobra  with  any other  medicine  in  your Tolero  nebuliser handset  which  is 
provided together with Vantobra. 
If you are taking several different treatments for cystic fibrosis, you should take them in the following order: 
1.  Bronchodilator therapy, such as salbutamol 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  Chest physiotherapy 
3.  Other inhaled medicines 
4.  Vantobra 
Please check this order with your doctor as well. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If  you  are  pregnant  or breast-feeding,  think  you  may be  pregnant or  are  planning to have  a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
It is not known whether inhaling this medicine while you are pregnant causes side effects. When they are given 
by  injection,  tobramycin  and  other  aminoglycoside  antibiotics  can  cause  harm  to  an  unborn  child,  such  as 
deafness and kidney problems. 
If you are breast feeding, you should talk to your doctor before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Vantobra is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
3. 
How to use Vantobra 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.  
The recommended dose is two ampoules each day (one in the morning and one in the evening) for 28 days.  
•  The dose is the same for all persons aged 6 years and older. 
• 
Inhale by mouth the full content of one ampoule in the morning, and one ampoule in the evening using the 
Tolero nebuliser handset. 
It is best to have an interval as close as possible to 12 hours between doses, but this interval must be at 
least 6 hours. 
• 
•  After you have used your medicine for 28 days, you then have a 28-day break, during which you do not 
• 
inhale any Vantobra. You then start another course after the break (as illustrated). 
It is important that you keep using the medicine twice each day during your 28 days on treatment, and that 
you keep to the 28-day on / 28-day off cycle. 
ON Vantobra  
Use Vantobra twice a day for 28 days  Do not use any Vantobra for the next 28 days 
OFF Vantobra 
     Repeat cycle 
Continue using Vantobra on this cyclical basis for as long as your doctor tells you.  
If you have questions about how long to use Vantobra, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
Preparing Vantobra for inhalation 
•    Use  Vantobra  only  with  the  Tolero nebuliser handset  shown in  the  picture  below  to  make  sure  you 
inhale the correct dose. Do not use the Tolero nebuliser handset for any other medicine.  
•    Read the Instructions for Use provided with the handset device before use.  
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
       
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
•  Make sure you have an eTrack or eBase controller to connect the Tolero nebuliser handset. The 
respective controller can be prescribed by your physician or purchased separately. 
•  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
•  Remove one ampoule of Vantobra from the aluminium foil sachet just before inhalation.  
•  Keep the rest of the medicine refrigerated in the original box. 
•  Lay out all the pieces of your Tolero nebuliser handset on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. Make sure 
the nebuliser handset is on a flat, stable surface. 
•  Assemble the Tolero nebuliser handset as illustrated in the Instructions for Use of the handset device. 
•  Hold the ampoule upright and tap lightly before twisting off the head part to avoid spilling. Empty the 
contents of one ampoule into the medication reservoir of the nebuliser handset. 
•  Begin  your  treatment  sitting  in  an  upright  position,  in  a  well  ventilated  room.  Hold  the  nebuliser 
handset  horizontally  and  breath  normally  through  your  mouth.  Avoid  breathing  through your  nose. 
Continue to inhale and exhale comfortably until the treatment is finished. When all of the medicine 
has been delivered, you will hear the “treatment complete” tone. 
If you need to interrupt your treatment for any reason, press and hold the On/Off button for one full 
second. To re-start the treatment, press and hold the On/Off button again for one full second to resume 
treatment. 
• 
•  The Tolero nebuliser handset must be cleaned and disinfected as described in the instructions for use 
of the device. 
•  Use a new Tolero nebuliser handset for each treatment cycle (28 days on-treatment) as provided with 
the medicine. 
Do not use an alternative untested nebuliser system because it may alter the amount of medicine reaching the 
lungs. This in turn may alter how well the medicine works and its safety. 
If you use more Vantobra than you should 
If you inhale too much Vantobra you may get a very hoarse voice. Tell your doctor as soon as possible. If 
Vantobra is swallowed, it is unlikely to cause severe problems as tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the 
stomach, but you should still tell your doctor as soon as possible. 
If you forget to use Vantobra 
If you forget to use Vantobra and there are at least 6 hours to your next dose, use your dose as soon as you 
can. Otherwise, wait for your next dose. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Vantobra 
Do not stop using Vantobra unless your doctor tells you to do so, as your lung infection may not be 
controlled sufficiently and may become worse. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

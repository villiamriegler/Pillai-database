2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
At the time of submission of this variation, Tenkasi 400 mg powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion is approved for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABBSSSI) in 
adults. 
Assessment report  
EMA/323178/2023  
Page 7/36 
 
 
 
The new formulation (1200 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) is applied for in the 
same indication. 
ABSSSIs include cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infections, major cutaneous abscesses, and burn infections. 
They  commonly  involve  at  least  a  75  cm 2  surface  area  of  redness,  oedema  and/or  induration 
accompanied  by  lymph  node  enlargement  or  systemic  symptoms  such  as  fever  [FDA,  2010]. 
The most common bacteria identified in ABSSSI are Gram-positive pathogens, including streptococci and 
staphylococci.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
ABSSSI are among the most common human bacterial infections and include cellulitis, erysipelas, 
wound infections (traumatic or post-surgical) and major abscesses. Cellulitis and abscesses are 
commonly encountered in the community setting and frequently result in hospitalisation. ABSSSI such 
as surgical site infections and burn infections are also seen in the hospital setting. Both erysipelas and 
cellulitis are characterised by rapidly spreading areas of oedema, redness, and heat, sometimes 
accompanied by lymphangitis and enlargement of the regional lymph nodes. ABSSSI are a common 
indication for antibiotic use in Europe and are associated with considerable morbidity. Data from the 
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimated that 4% of all healthcare-
acquired infections (HAI) reported between 2011 and 2012 were ABSSSI, with surgical-site infections 
being the second most frequently reported HAI (19.6%) (ECDC, Surveillance report 2011–2012). 
In Europe, the most frequently isolated Gram-positive ABSSSI pathogen is S. aureus (including 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)), followed by β-
haemolytic streptococci. 
The prevalence of MRSA has increased worldwide in both healthcare- and community-based settings. 
In Europe, the prevalence of MRSA varies greatly across countries, with much higher frequencies seen 
in southern and south-eastern countries. Based on the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance 
Network (EARS-Net), the European population-weighted mean percentage for MRSA was 15.5% in 
2019, ranging from 1.1% in Norway to 46.7% in Romania (ECDC, Surveillance Report: Antimicrobial 
resistance in EU/EEA (EARS-Net), 2020).  
In particular, in patients with comorbidities and those previously treated with antibiotics, ABSSSI can 
often be polymicrobial, with Gram-negative and obligate anaerobic pathogens found together with 
Gram-positive organisms. Gram-negative aetiology is common in surgical-site infections setting as 
reported in the SENTRY programme (1998 – 2004), with P. aeruginosa being the second most 
important pathogen after MRSA, followed by E. coli.  
Drug-resistant bacteria are playing an increasing role as causative pathogens in ABSSSI.  
P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. can play an 
important role in polymicrobial long-standing infections such as diabetic foot infection and decubiti but 
are also increasingly recognised in monomicrobial ABSSSI. The presence of MRSA in surgical site 
infections is independently associated with mortality compared with patients with MSSA. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
No new indication is applied for. 
Assessment report  
EMA/323178/2023  
Page 8/36 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Management 
Management of ABSSSI is dependent on the clinical presentation and the severity of the infection. 
Initial treatment of ABSSSI is usually empirical because culture results are not immediately available, 
and patients with ABSSSI benefit from rapid initiation of appropriate therapy (Clinical guideline 
(CG74), NICE 2014). Most streptococci remain susceptible to penicillin and β-lactam antibiotics, 
providing many treatment options for adults when culture results are known. Infections due to MRSA 
are more complex in terms of management in hospital because of the additional steps that must be 
implemented for their treatment (e.g. decolonisation, protective clothing for nurses, isolation units, 
more expensive antibiotics, frequent laboratory tests, or blood cultures).  
When MRSA is identified as a single pathogen, a number of treatment options are available in Europe, 
including vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, tedizolid, oritavancin, dalbavancin, and 
ceftaroline. Agents like vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin have been available for some time. 
However, these older agents, along with many of the drugs more recently approved for ABSSSI, 
provide only Gram-positive coverage. In particular, linezolid is one of the most used agents for an 
empirical starting of the treatment due to its activity against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive 
organisms. 
Ceftaroline and tigecycline are active against Gram-negative organisms but are only available in an IV 
formulation. Cephalosporins, carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem), and ureido-penicillins (such as 
piperacillin), aminoglycosides, or quinolone antibacterials can be used to provide Gram-negative 
coverage in these situations, as well. In cases where MRSA and Gram-negative organisms are isolated, 
these agents can be added to MRSA active agents. 
2.2.  About the product 
The active substance of Tenkasi is oritavancin. Oritavancin is a semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide 
antibiotic that has three principal mechanisms of action: 1) inhibition of the transglycosylation 
(polymerisation) step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the stem peptide of peptidoglycan 
precursors; 2) inhibition of the transpeptidation (crosslinking) step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding 
to the peptide bridging segments of the cell wall; and 3) disruption of bacterial membrane integrity, 
leading to depolarisation, permeabilisation, and rapid cell death. These multiple mechanisms contribute 
to the rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity of oritavancin. 
The currently marketed formulation of oritavancin, 400 mg powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion, was approved in the EU on 18th March 2015 (EMEA/H/C/003785) for the treatment of acute 
bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults. 
Oritavancin is dosed as a 1200 mg single intravenous (IV) infusion. The current formulation of 
oritavancin is packaged as 3 vials, each containing 400 mg of oritavancin and the inactive component 
mannitol. The vials are reconstituted with sterile water for injection (SWFI) and further diluted in 
Dextrose 5% in water (D5W) for a total volume of 1000 mL and infused IV over 3 hours. 
A new formulation of oritavancin has been developed which utilises the excipient 2-hydroxypropyl-β-
cyclodextrin (HPβCD) to improve solubility. The new formulation is packaged as a single vial containing 
1200 mg oritavancin, 2400 mg HPβCD, and mannitol. It is reconstituted with SWFI, and further diluted 
with 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) or D5W for a total volume of 250 mL and infused IV over 1 hour. 
The new formulation intends to simplify the preparation of the solution for infusion, reduce the volume 
of the infusion, shorten the infusion time and give pharmacies flexibility to use either D5W or normal 
saline (NS) for dilution.

2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The MAH submitted an application under article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and 
Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, point 2 (c). 
This application fulfils the CHMP recommendation to explore ways to improve handling or reformulating 
oritavancin 400 mg by developing a 1200 mg single vial presentation as part of lifecycle management. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 1200 
mg of oritavancin (as oritavancin diphosphate) per vial. 
Other ingredients are: hydroxypropylbetadex, mannitol, phosphoric acid, sodium hydroxide. 
The product is available in a single-use 50 ml Type 1 glass vial with rubber stopper and aluminium flip 
off cap as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The active substance, oritavancin diphosphate (INN: oritavancin), is identical to the substance already 
authorised in Tenkasi 400 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. The active substance’s 
physicochemical properties, synthesis, controls, and stability are fully described in the approved 
marketing authorisation application for the 400 mg strength. It has a relative molecular mass of 
1989.09 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The active substance is a white to pale pink powder. The solubility in water is 60.75 mg/mL; the solubility 
in buffers depends on nature of buffer and pH, with reduced solubility at neutral pH (e.g. 0.42 mg/mL in 
Assessment report  
EMA/323178/2023  
Page 10/36 
 
 
 
 
 
phosphate buffer at pH 7.0). The partition coefficient is -0.64 indicating poor lipophilicity. The substance 
is hygroscopic.  
Since the substance is dissolved during the manufacturing process of the finished product, particle size 
distribution and polymorphism are not relevant quality attributes to control or test.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a lyophilised, solid white to off white or pink cake or powder packaged in a 50 
mL Type I glass vial with rubber stopper and aluminium flip-off cap.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The approved 400 mg/vial formulation requires three vials to reconstitute and administer the 1200 mg 
dose.  The  new  formulation  of  1200 mg/vial  requires  only  one  vial  per  dose.  In  this  new  formulation, 
hydroxypropylbetadex (HPβCD), a betacyclodextrin derivatised with propylene oxide, was added as an 
additional  excipient to enhance the solubility  and  stability  of  oritavancin  at neutral pH  and in  isotonic 
media.  The  1200 mg  formulation  will  be  manufactured  by  the  same  manufacturer  as  Oritavancin 400 
mg,  by  the  same  process,  with  slight  changes  to  accommodate  the  new  excipient,  and  will  have  the 
same primary container closure system as the 400 mg formulation.  
While the 400 mg formulation is incompatible with standard saline infusion solution, the new 1200 mg 
formulation allows the use of saline solution for infusion. The 400 mg formulation is reconstituted with 
sterile WFI, further diluted in glucose 5 % in water (D5W) for a total volume of 1000 mL and infused 
intravenously over 3 hours. The new formulation is presented as a single vial which will be reconstituted 
with sterile WFI and further diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride or D5W for a total volume of 250 mL and 
infused  intravenously  over  1  hour  only.  Thus,  the  new  formulation  allows  administration  of  a  higher 
concentration (4.8 mg/mL instead of 1.2 mg/mL) in a shorter period of time (one hour instead of three 
hours with the 400 mg formulation), with a lower infusion rate (4.167 mL/min versus 5.55 mL/min with 
the  400 mg  formulation).  Clinical  pharmacology  studies  demonstrated  that  comparable  systemic 
exposure  and  tissue  distribution  are  observed  for  both  the  old  and  new  formulations  and  methods  of 
administration. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing.  
The  use  of  sterile  filtration  followed  by  aseptic  processing  as  manufacturing  process  for  the  applied 
finished product is sufficiently justified as other sterilisation methods resulted in extensive degradation 
of oritavancin. The applied sterile filtration approach is supported by filter compatibility studies and media 
fills. 
Studies demonstrated absence of risk for leachables from the rubber stoppers. 
The primary packaging is a 50 mL Type I glass vial with rubber stopper and aluminium flip-off cap. The 
materials comply with Ph. Eur. requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of eight main steps: dispensing, compounding, bioburden reduction 
filtration, aseptic filtration through 2 sterilizing filters, filling of vials and partial stoppering, lyophilisation 
and  stoppering,  capping,  and  visual  inspection.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard 
manufacturing process.  
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate. 
The process has been fully validated by three full scale batches.  
Holding times were adequately addressed and validated during process validation.  
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specification  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance (visual), reconstitution time (visual), visible particulates (visual), color and clarity of solution 
(Ph. Eur.), identity (HPLC, UV), assay and impurities (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water 
content  (Karl  Fischer),  residual  ethanol  (GC),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.),  particulate  matter  (Ph.  Eur.),  bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), and sterility (Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in 
the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary.  
Ethanol is used in the manufacturing of active substance, and residual ethanol is present in the active 
substance at a level above the ICH Q3C limit. The lyophilisation step in the finished product 
manufacturing process ensures the residual ethanol in the finished product is reduced to a level below 
the ICH Q3 limit, which is also controlled in the finished product at release.  
During the procedure, a MO was raised to which the company responded by tightening certain impurity 
limit and by reintegration of stability chromatograms. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for six full scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Assessment report  
EMA/323178/2023  
Page 12/36 
 
 
 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three full scale batches of finished product stored for up to 48 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
During the procedure, a MO was raised to which the company responded by updating appropriately the 
stability data package. 
Samples were tested for appearance, reconstitution time, visual particulates, particulate matter, pH, 
water content, assay of oritavancin and impurities, sterility and bacterial endotoxins. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating.  
Some impurities showed a slight increase over time, but remained well within specifications, and are 
not likely to have a significant effect on efficacy and safety of the product when used according to the 
directions in the SmPC. The other parameters tested showed no trends. 
Photostability studies were conducted according to ICH Q1B for the Oritavancin 400 mg formulation. 
The molecule was demonstrated to be stable in the clear glass vial without label and not to be light-
sensitive. Consequently, no special packaging protection from light is needed.  
No additional photostability studies were performed on the new 1200-mg formulation, since the MAH 
assumed that the increase in active substance per vial, the more neutral pH, and the addition of the 
new HPβCD excipient will not affect photostability. This rationale was accepted by CHMP.  
In-use stability demonstrated that the reconstituted and diluted solution is physically and chemically 
stable for 48 hours at 25°C. From a microbiological point of view, the finished product should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility 
of the user and would normally not be longer than 4 hours at 25 °C and 12 hours at 2 °C -8 °C 
following dilution in a glucose 5% or sodium chloride 0.9% intravenous infusion bag. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months with no special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Oritavancin is newly formulated with 1200 mg in each vial to improve the handling of this substance. 
The new formulation utilizes the excipient hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD, hydroxypropyl 
betadex) to improve the solubility. Nevertheless, oritavancin NF is formulated to deliver the same dose 
of oritavancin as the currently approved formulation and is administered for the same indication. 
Therefore, the non-clinical program is amended by three studies to support comparability to the 
current formulation in addition to two corresponding method validations, as well as literature-based 
safety information for the excipient hydroxypropylbetadex (HPβCD).

No new primary, secondary, or safety pharmacology studies were conducted to support this 
application. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two new GLP bioanalytical method studies (0017-3571 and 0017-3560) were developed to support the 
28-day repeat dose toxicity study comparing the toxicity and TK of oritavancin in D5W with oritavancin 
in HPβCD. Both methods met the defined validation requirements.

Comparative absorption for both formulations was analysed after single dose and 4-weeks daily 
intravenous 1-hour infusion in rats. Similar to the findings in the previously conducted ADME studies 
for oritavancin 400 mg, the new studies for oritavancin NF exhibited linear, dose proportional plasma 
kinetics with maximal levels attained at the first sampling time point after the end of infusion. There 
were no gender differences in the PK among the different species in repeat dose studies and there was 
no plasma accumulation of oritavancin following multiple dosing.  
Tissue distribution was analysed in a GLP QWBA study (00843501) in rats. Formulations of [14C]-
oritavancin were administered as a single 60-minute IV infusions to male and female Sprague Dawley 
rats at 20 mg/kg and a target radioactivity of 100 μCi/kg in both vehicles. Overall, the oritavancin 
tissue distribution pattern was similar in this study to the previously conducted QWBA studies. In 
addition, no significant differences with respect to oritavancin distribution were identified between the 
two vehicles. The slower administration over 1 hour did not result in a different tissue distribution in 
comparison to the previous faster bolus injections. Only at one time-point, the oritavancin 
concentration in the eye was slightly above the LLOQ (527 ng equiv./g) in the new formulation in the 
analysed male and female while not detectable in the eyes of the corresponding DW5 treated animals. 
The presence of HPβCD at a 2:1 w/w ratio to oritavancin, the same as in the clinical formulation, 
produced no substantive differences in oritavancin exposure, accumulation, tissue distribution, or 
elimination. 
No new studies for oritavancin metabolism and excretion were conducted. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
A comparative non-GLP single dose study with 1-hour infusion to compare pharmacokinetics and 
toxicity of oritavancin formulated in D5W and HPβCD (4:1 w/w ratio of HPβCD : oritavancin) was 
conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats. The final doses (50 and 100 mg/kg) were reached by dilution in 
D5W. A final concentration of 10 mg/mL (50 mg/kg dose with 4% HPβCD) and 20 mg/mL (100 mg/kg 
dose with 8% HPβCD) was used. 
The corresponding PK data indicate that the formulation did not have an impact on the 
pharmacokinetics of oritavancin. The NOAEL was determined at the highest dose. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
In a 28-day comparative GLP repeat-dose toxicity study in rats a once daily 60-minute IV infusion of 
the current D5W or the new HPβCD in D5W formulation including respective vehicle controls was 
analysed for toxicity and corresponding oritavancin toxicokinetics. The analysed HPβCD formulation in 
the study was similar to the applied clinical formulation for humans, in a 2:1 w/w ratio of HPβCD to 
oritavancin. Three doses, vehicle controls, 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg/d were analysed for both formulations. 
The NOAEL was concluded at the mid-dose of 15 mg/kg/d due to the low severity and incidence of the 
observed findings. In general, all findings (hematology, liver, kidney, GI tract) were similar for 
Oritavancin D5W (current formulation) and Oritavancin HPβCD (Oritavancin NF) except for HPβCD-
related findings in the kidney. Minimal to moderate renal tubular changes, consisting of increased 
tubular rarefaction (pallor) accompanied by small segments of tubular vacuolar degeneration occurred 
in all HPβCD-treated animals including the respective vehicle controls. The kidney changes in the 
Oritavancin NF treated animals did not result in differences of renal function, as the extent of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/323178/2023  
Page 15/36 
 
 
 
increase of serum urea and creatinine or the changes in urinary parameters did not differ between the 
animals treated with the different vehicles and formulations. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No new genotoxicity studies have been conducted. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No new reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
The relative plasma exposure (oritavancin in HPβCD/oritavancin D5W) ranged from 0.812 - 1.31 for Cmax 
and from 0.841 - 1.29 for AUC (last) in the 28-day repeat-dose toxicity study and is therefore considered 
equivalent in rats. No HPβCD plasma levels were determined in this study. 
2.5.4.7.  Tolerance 
No new local tolerance studies have been conducted. Local tolerance endpoints were included into the 
comparative 28-day repeat-dose toxicity. No evidence that the formulation containing HPβCD produced 
significant or enhanced adverse effects at the injection site was found beyond the usual procedure 
related local findings that were also recognised in control groups. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
The MAH summarized the known non-clinical data for HPβCD from the literature. The respective 
literature references are listed in the non-clinical AR. 
Safety pharmacology 
No effects were observed on mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, QRS duration, QT interval, or 
cardiac tissue damage when compared to dextrose-treated controls after total IV doses of 62.85 and 
251.4 mg/kg in Wistar rats.  
At high doses (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg) of HPβCD administered by intravenous infusion to 
anesthetized Beagle dogs produced increased renal arteriolar resistance and decreased renal blood 
flow, more prominently in females than males, without impact on pulmonary hemodynamic parameters 
or cardiac electrophysiology. However, an increase in mean blood pressure, associated with a reflex 
decrease in heart rate, was observed at the highest dose, with significant effects on those parameters 
observed in females only. 
Single-Dose Toxicity 
A single IV dose of 2250 mg/kg HPβCD was reported to be lethal to rats, however when the dose was 
reduced to 1000 mg/kg, no deaths or adverse clinical signs were observed. 
A single IV dose of 2 g/kg or 10 g/kg HPβCD given to cynomolgus monkeys was reported not to be 
lethal. 
Assessment report  
EMA/323178/2023  
Page 16/36 
 
 
 
Repeat-Dose Toxicity 
Repeated IV administration of HPβCD in animals was generally well tolerated when administered at 
doses of up to 400 mg/kg/day. 
Rats administered HPβCD at a dose of 225 mg/kg / day by continuous infusion for 4 or 7 days 
exhibited histopathological changes including foamy macrophage infiltration of the lungs, with some 
associated alveolitis, haemorrhage, and atelectasis. Renal cortical tubular vacuolation of the proximal 
convoluted tubules and mild reduced splenic extramedullary haematopoiesis were also seen. Reversible 
vacuolation of renal tubular epithelium cells was the primary effect observed in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies, without evidence of deterioration of renal function or histopathological evidence of kidney 
toxicity. 
Two 3-month IV toxicity studies were conducted in rats and dogs at doses of 50, 100, or 400 
mg/kg/day. In rats, the NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/day. At 100 mg/kg/day, there were minimal histological 
changes (swollen epithelial cells) in the bladder, swollen and granular kidney tubular cells, and an 
increase in Kupffer cells in the liver. At 400 mg/kg/day, there were decreases in body weight and food 
consumption, increased water consumption, decreased haematocrit, haemoglobin, and erythrocyte 
levels, and increased creatinine, total bilirubin, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels. 
Increases in spleen, adrenal, and kidney weights, along with histopathological changes in lungs (foamy 
cells), spleen, and liver were also seen at this dose level. These changes were reversible after one 
month, with the exception of small elevations in AST and ALT and partial reversal of urinary tract 
bladder and lung findings. 
In dogs administered IV doses of 50, 100, or 400 mg/kg for 3 months, the NOAEL was 100 mg/kg/day. 
At 400 mg/kg/day, there were slight increases in plasma liver enzymes and foamy cells in lung and 
swollen epithelial cells of the bladder and renal pelvis. All changes were reversible after one month 
except for incomplete reversibility of swollen renal pelvis epithelium. 
Genotoxicity 
HPβCD was reported to be negative in an Ames assay at levels up to 1000 g/plate and in an in vivo 
micronucleus assay at doses up to 5000 mg/kg/day. In addition, HPβCD was reported to be negative in 
an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, a mouse lymphoma assay, and a human lymphocyte 
chromosome aberration assay. 
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity 
In rats dosed throughout the period of organogenesis (gestation day 6 - 16), intravenous doses of 400 
mg/kg/day HPβCD produced slight maternal toxicity but no adverse effects in offspring. No adverse 
effects were observed in rabbits given IV doses of up to 400 mg/kg/day. In rats given oral doses of 
500, 200, and 5000 mg/kg/day, no maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, or teratogenicity were observed. 
Rabbits dosed orally at 1000 mg/kg/day exhibited slight maternal and embryotoxicity but no evidence 
of teratogenicity. 
Similarly, oral doses of HPβCD at levels of 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day were reported to produce no effects 
on rat fertility and no evidence of teratogenicity in rats or rabbits. Evidence of maternal toxicity was 
observed in rabbits at both dose levels. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The present extension application to add a new strength without changing the recommended 
maximum daily dose of 1,200 mg will not lead to an increased predicted environmental concentration 
compared to the initial environmental risk assessment. Hence, the initial environmental risk 
Assessment report  
EMA/323178/2023  
Page 17/36 
 
 
 
assessment submitted with the MAA is still valid and an update is considered not necessary. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH stated that no additional new nonclinical pharmacology studies were conducted because the 
newly conducted studies described above indicated that the extent of the systemic exposure, the organ 
distribution pattern and the observed toxicity of the current oritavancin formulation and oritavancin NF 
were comparable, indicating that HPβCD will not change the already established pharmacodynamics 
activity and the safety pharmacology profile of oritavancin. This view is supported. 
The main focus on this application was further to clarify if the new formulation that includes HPβCD has 
any impact on the overall (PK) pharmacokinetics of oritavancin since oritavancin PK is known from the 
initial MAA for the 400 mg formulation in D5W. 
In general, no significant differences with respect to absorption, elimination, accumulation, and tissue 
distribution were observed for both formulations (D5W and HPβCD). Only at one time-point in the rat 
QWBA study, the oritavancin concentration in the eye was slightly above the LLOQ (527 ng equiv./g) in 
the new formulation in the analysed male and female while not detectable in the eyes of the 
corresponding DW5 treated animals. This small difference is considered of negligible overall relevance 
due to the short duration and low concentration. The oritavancin tissue distribution pattern was further 
similar in this study to the previously conducted QWBA studies. 
No new studies for oritavancin metabolism and excretion were conducted as cyclodextrins are known 
to have no impact on metabolism and excretion. Drug dissociation due to dilution is the major release 
mechanism. The drug is not changed and metabolism and excretion follow the same routes. 
The original oritavancin nonclinical program evaluated single dose toxicity in rats, repeat dose toxicity 
in rats and dogs, genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo studies, reproductive and developmental toxicity in 
rats and rabbits, juvenile animal toxicity in rats and dogs, and because oritavancin accumulates in 
macrophages, a series of in vitro studies were conducted in macrophage cell lines and in vivo studies 
were conducted in rats to evaluate immune function. Since these data evaluated the overall non-
clinical safety for oritavancin. As the final oritavancin dose is not changed by the new formulation 
(Oritavancin NF) only comparative studies, one single dose and one 28-day repeat-dose toxicity study, 
to analyse the differences between both formulations (D5W and HPβCD) were conducted to analyse 
toxicity and toxicokinetic of both formulations. This approach is supported. 
Due to the slower infusion time (1 hour) no toxicity for oritavancin was observed in the comparative 
non-GLP SD study in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg in both formulations. In addition, no 
differences in toxicokinetic and PK parameters were observed. In contrast, the initially conducted SD 
toxicity study with 1.5 to 2 minutes bolus injections in rats elicited pronounced overall toxicities in 
addition to mortality at doses in a similar range (40, 80, 120 mg/kg). 
In a 28-day comparative GLP repeat-dose toxicity study in rats a once daily 60-minute IV infusion of 
the current D5W or the new HPβCD in D5W formulation including respective vehicle controls was 
analysed for toxicity and corresponding oritavancin toxicokinetic. The analysed HPβCD formulation in 
the study was similar to the applied clinical formulation for humans, in a 2:1 w/w ratio of HPβCD to 
oritavancin. Three doses, vehicle controls, 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg/d were analysed for both formulations. 
The NOAEL was concluded at the mid-dose of 15 mg/kg/d due to the low severity and incidence of the 
observed findings. In general, all findings (haematology, liver, kidney, GI tract) were similar for 
Oritavancin D5W (current formulation) and Oritavancin HPβCD (Oritavancin NF) except for HPβCD-
related findings in the kidney. Minimal to moderate renal tubular changes, consisting of increased 
tubular rarefaction (pallor) accompanied by small segments of tubular vacuolar degeneration occurred 
Assessment report  
EMA/323178/2023  
Page 18/36 
 
 
 
in all HPβCD-treated animals including the respective vehicle controls. The kidney changes in the 
Oritavancin NF treated animals did not result in differences of renal function, as the extent of the 
increase of serum urea and creatinine or the changes in urinary parameters did not differ between the 
animals treated with the different vehicles and formulations. These changes are an expected finding 
with IV dosing of HPβCD in rats (Gould and Scott, 2005), they are not associated with changes in 
kidney function, as also confirmed here. Therefore, the MAH concludes that these findings do not 
reflect a risk to human safety in patients treated with a single dose of oritavancin NF. 
According to the Report published in support of the ‘Questions and answers on cyclodextrins used as 
excipients in medicinal products for human use’ (EMA/CHMP/495747/2013), HPßCD can be found in 
marketed parenteral formulations with intravenous dosing up to 16 g daily in itraconazole formulations. 
No side effects were observed in humans after parenteral administration of up to 24 g of HPβCD daily 
for 15 days (Loftsson, T., Brewster, M.E., ‘Pharmaceutical applications of cyclodextrins: basic science 
and product development’, J. Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Vol. 62, 2010, p. 1607-1621). As Tenkasi 
1200 mg (Oritavancin NF) is given as a single administration this would result in a total dose of 2400 
mg per person, which is nevertheless well below the already marketed dose of 16 g HPβCD.  
Of greater relevance, HPßCD-related kidney findings did not worsen the changes of renal function 
induced by oritavancin, as the extent of the increase of serum urea and creatinine or the changes in 
urinary parameters observed in high dose groups were similar regardless the vehicle. Therefore, no 
increased renal toxicity is expected by a combination of HPβCD and oritavancin. 
At the NOAEL of the 28-day repeat-dose toxicity study no safety margins for oritavancin exposure are 
available as the exposure is almost similar. However, since oritavancin related toxicity was not 
changed by HPβCD in rats and this does not translate into a different conclusion on oritavancin safety. 
The non-clinical safety of HPßCD was thoroughly discussed by the MAH with a respective discussion of 
the available literature. Comparatively low concentrations of HPβCD are included in Oritavancin NF and 
oritavancin is further dosed as a single administration while other parenteral formulations for repeated 
infusions included higher doses HPßCD of per day. Therefore, and in addition to the known findings of 
the repeat-dose study, no change in the safety profile of the new formulation is expected. 
It can be expected that the addition of a new strength will not pose a risk to the environment when 
used in accordance with the Product Information. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The existing non-clinical program for oritavancin was bridged by pharmacokinetics and single and 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats which revealed no significant differences with respect to oritavancin 
in the new formulation. HPßCD-related known findings in kidneys were identified at comparatively low 
concentrations in the 28-day repeat-dose toxicity study but did not result in differences of renal 
function in comparison to the old formulation. This information has been included in the SmPC and an 
increased safety risk is not expected from these non-clinical data. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects

Study MDCO-ORI-15-01 
This was a Phase 1, single-centre, double-blind study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of a 
single 1200 mg IV infusion of the new oritavancin formulation in healthy adult subjects. 
For this, 56 subjects were enrolled and assigned to the following 6 cohorts: 
Assessment report  
EMA/323178/2023  
Page 20/36 
 
 
 
Within Cohort 1, all subjects were assigned to receive oritavancin. Within Cohorts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, 
subjects were randomly assigned to treatment in a ratio of 4:1 to receive oritavancin or placebo (8 
subjects on oritavancin, and 2 subjects on placebo). 
Subjects had blood collected for oritavancin plasma concentration analyses prior to the start of dosing 
(0 hours) and at the end of the infusion (either at 3 or 2 hours, or at 90, 60, or 30 minutes), and at 3, 
9, 21, 45, 69, and 165 hours after the completion of the infusion. 
Results 
All 46 subjects who received a dose of oritavancin were included in the PK analysis. The results are 
shown in Table 2. 
For Cohort 1, using the currently approved formulation and an infusion duration of 3 hours, the mean 
AUC0-last and AUC0-inf values (3278 and 3537 h*μg/mL, respectively) were higher (approximately 1.2- 
to 1.4-fold) than the AUC values for all other cohorts. The mean t1/2, Vz, and CL were shorter or lower 
(approximately 0.5- to 0.9-fold) for Cohort 1 compared with all other cohorts. 
For Cohorts 2 through 5 (oritavancin new formulation diluted in D5W), mean Cmax estimates were 
152.5, 176.8, 201.9, and 199.1 μg/mL, respectively, as the duration of infusion decreased across 
these cohorts (2 hours, and 90, 60, and 30 min, respectively). Mean AUC0-last and  
AUC0-inf values were similar across Cohorts 2 through 5, ranging from 2377 hr*μg/mL to 2807 
hr*μg/mL for AUC0-last and 2617 hr*μg/mL to 3063 hr*μg/mL for AUC0-inf. Mean t1/2, CL, and Vz were 
also comparable between Cohorts 2 through 5. 
For Cohort 6, in which the oritavancin new formulation was diluted in NS and infused over 60 min, 
mean Cmax was 205.8 μg/mL, and mean AUC0-last and AUC0-inf values were 2719 and 2962 hr*μg/mL, 
respectively. These values were comparable to the results for the same PK parameters for Cohort 4, in 
which the infusion duration was also 60 min (mean Cmax 201.9 μg/ml, mean AUC0-last and AUC0-inf, 2535 
and 2756 hr*μg/mL, respectively).

Distribution 
Oritavancin distributes widely into tissue. 
Elimination 
Oritavancin is not metabolised and is slowly excreted unchanged in faeces and urine.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Oritavancin exhibits linear PK at doses up to 1200 mg. Oritavancin does not demonstrate time-dependent 
PK. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study ML-ORI-102 
This was a randomised, open-label, multi-centre study in adult subjects who had a diagnosis of ABSSSI 
(wound infection, cellulitis/erysipelas, or cutaneous abscess) suspected or confirmed to be caused by a 
Gram-positive pathogen. One-hundred-two (102) subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 
1:1 ratio to the current approved formulation or the new formulation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/323178/2023  
Page 22/36 
 
 
 
 
Subjects randomised to the current approved formulation received 1200 mg oritavancin reconstituted 
in SWFI and further diluted in D5W to a final volume of 1000 mL, infused over 3 hours. Subjects 
randomised to the new formulation received 1200 mg oritavancin reconstituted with SWFI and further 
diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to a final volume of 250 mL, infused over 1 hour. 
Blood samples for the analysis of oritavancin in plasma were collected on Day 1 pre-dose and at the 
end of infusion (1 hour or 3 hours), and then at 3 hours (for 1 hour infusion), 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 
hours, 72 hours, and 168 hours after the start of the infusion. 
Results 
One-hundred (100) subjects were included in the PK population (two subjects did not complete the 
study drug infusion and therefore did not have post-baseline PK samples collected). The oritavancin PK 
parameter are summarised in Table 3.  
Due to the shorter infusion time, the mean oritavancin Cmax was approximately 1.32-fold higher 
following administration of the new formulation as compared to the currently approved oritavancin 
formulation. Consistently, the mean time to reach Cmax was also lower with the new formulation than 
the currently approved formulation (1.21 hours vs. 3.37 hours). 
Mean AUC0-72 was 1470 h*μg/mL for the currently approved formulation, compared to 1460 h*μg/mL 
for the new formulation. Mean AUC0-168 was 1760 h*μg/mL for the currently approved formulation, 
compared to 1750 h*μg/mL for the new formulation (Table 3). 
Table 3: Summary of mean (CV%) oritavancin PK parameter (PK analysis set); study ML-
ORI-102 
The geometric mean ratios of AUC0-72 and AUC0-168 were within the range of 80% to 125% (109.6% for 
AUC0-72, 106.6% for AUC0-168). However, the upper limit of the 90% CI for AUC0-72 was slightly outside 
the bioequivalence interval (Table 4).

oritavancin following a single 1200 mg IV infusion in ABSSSI patients; study ML-ORI-102 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The new formulation relies on HPβCD a modified cyclodextrin which is renally excreted. Thus, clearance 
of HPβCD may be reduced in patients with renal impairment. See section on clinical safety  for further 
discussion. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Not applicable since no new data have been submitted. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
During the assessment of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application, the CHMP highlighted that the 
combination of three vials bears a risk of contamination during handling and the MAH was requested to 
explore ways to improve handling or reformulating oritavancin 400 mg by developing a 1200 mg vial 
presentation as part of lifecycle management. 
Thus, the applied new oritavancin formulation was developed to deliver the same dose as the currently 
approved 400 mg oritavancin formulation and to be administered for the same indication.   
To support the application, two Phase 1 studies were conducted to compare PK data of the new 
formulation with the currently approved formulation in healthy subjects and patients with ABSSSI. 
In healthy subjects, oritavancin exposure was lower with the new formulation compared to the 
currently approved 400 mg formulation. However, in the target population exposures were similar and 
comparable to PK data of ABSSSI patients included in the two Phase 3 studies SOLO I & II conducted 
with the currently approved formulation. Since the AUC/MIC ratio of oritavancin correlates best with 
efficacy, it would be expected that the new formulation has a similar efficacy as the currently approved 
formulation. Moreover, Cmax values in ABSSSI patients from study ML-ORI-102 and the Phase 3 
studies SOLO I & II conducted with the currently approved formulation were comparable.  
The results of study ML-ORI-102 are reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC of both formulations. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The exposure of the currently approved oritavancin formulation (1200 mg dissolved in a total volume 
of 1000 ml) infused over 3 hours was comparable to the new oritavancin formulation (1200 mg

dissolved in a total volume of 250 ml) administered over 1 hours in patients with ABSSI.

2.6.6.  Clinical safety 
Study MDCO-ORI-15-01 
In this study 46 healthy subjects received a single 1200 mg dose of oritavancin, 6 subjects the 
currently approved formulation and 40 subjects the new formulation (for description of the study see 
section 3.3.1.1). 
Overall, 10 subjects (17.9%) reported at least 1 TEAE and 8 subjects (14.3%) reported a TEAE 
considered related to study drug. There were no deaths, SAEs, or TEAEs leading to study drug or study 
discontinuation. All TEAEs were mild in severity. 
A higher percentage of subjects (4 subjects, 50.0%) reported TEAEs in Cohort 3 (90-minute IV 
infusion) followed by subjects (3 subjects, 37.5%) in Cohort 4 (60-minute IV infusion). Similar 
percentages of subjects reported TEAEs considered related to study drug in Cohorts 3 and 4 (3 
subjects each, 37.5%). No TEAEs were reported by subjects in Cohort 1 (3-hour IV infusion) or Cohort 
2 (2-hour IV infusion). There was no evidence of an increase or change in TEAEs with a decrease in 
infusion time in Cohorts 1 through 5 and no evidence of a response to switching to NS between 
Cohorts 4 and 6.  
A summary of TEAEs by SOC with a reasonable possibility of being study related is presented in Table 
7. Overall, TEAS reported by more than one subject and with a reasonable possibility of being related 
to study drug were diarrhoea, oral paraesthesia and headache (2 subjects each, 3.6%).

Study ML-ORI-102 
In this study 52 subjects with ABSSSI received a 3-hour IV infusion of the currently approved 
oritavancin formulation (1200 mg diluted in 1000 ml of D5W) and 50 ABSSSI patients received a 1-
hour IV Infusion of the new oritavancin formulation (1200 mg diluted in 250 ml of NS; for description 
of the study refer to section 3.3.1.1).  
Overall, 31 subjects (59.6%) in the currently approved formulation group and 24 subjects (48.0%) in 
the new formulation group reported at least 1 TEAE. Of subjects with at least 1 TEAE, 20 (38.5%) in 
the oritavancin 400 mg formulation group, and 11 (22.0%) in the new formulation group experienced 
TEAEs that were considered related to study drug. There were no deaths in the study. While the 
majority of TEAEs in either group were mild or moderate, 1 subject (1.9%) in the 400 mg formulation 
group and 2 subjects (4%) in the new formulation group experienced TEAEs that were serious: 1 
subject in the currently approved formulation group were assessed with cellulitis and 2 subjects in the 
new formulation group were assessed with cellulitis or pyelonephritis. One subject in the 400 mg 
formulation group discontinued from study drug due to a related TEAE of hypersensitivity (that was not 
considered an SAE).

Overall, TEAes reported by more than 1 subject and with a reasonable possibility of being related to 
study drug were diarrhoea, nausea, hypersensitivity, pruritus and pruritus generalised (Table 7). 
In summary, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders TEAEs were the most frequent TEAEs by SOC, 
were generally related, and occurred more frequently in the oritavancin 400 mg formulation group 
than the oritavancin new formulation group. Overall, pruritus events (pruritus and pruritus 
generalised) were nearly twice as frequent in the oritavancin 400 mg formulation group (19.2%, 10 of 
52 subjects) compared with the oritavancin new formulation group (10%, 5 of 50 subjects). The 
remaining events in this SOC, urticaria and red man syndrome, were uncommon.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
•  Hypersensitivity 
In  study  ML-ORI-102,  a  similar  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  currently  approved  formulation  group 
(3.8%) and new formulation group (4%) had AESIs. The AESIs were limited to hypersensitivity/infused 
related reactions (IRR). 
For the MDCO-ORI-15-01 clinical study, there were no reported hypersensitivity AEs. 
•  Renal Impairment 
Due to the presence of the excipient HPβCD in the new oritavancin formulation, the MAH evaluated AEs 
and laboratory investigations following study completion for any evidence of post-exposure renal 
adverse effects. Review of all AEs, related and unrelated, showed no TEAEs of renal impairment, renal 
failure nor similar events.

2.6.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of the currently approved formulation has been well characterised in the oritavancin 400 mg 
formulation development program as well as in post-marketing surveillance since the oritavancin 400 
mg formulation has been approved in the EU in 2015. The applied 1200 mg oritavancin formulation 
was developed to deliver the same dose as the currently approved 400 mg oritavancin formulation and 
to be administered for the same indication.  However, tolerability of the faster infusion time and the 
excipient HPβCD which is renally eliminated are particular important for the new formulation. 
Reduced infusion time 
Comparison of Cmax values from ABSSSI patients in study ML-ORI-102 and SOLO I & II showed similar 
values. In study ML-ORI-102, mean Cmax (min, max) was 112 (25, 193) µg/ml and 148 (14.1, 265) 
µg/ml for the currently approved and new formulation, respectively, reflecting the expected increase in 
Cmax for the shorter infusion time of the new formulation. In the Phase 3 studies, mean Cmax (min, 
max) of the currently approved formulation was 138 (11.1, 319) µg/ml. Hence, the observed Cmax 
distribution following administration of the new formulation lies within the PopPK-model derived Cmax 
distribution of the currently approved formulation and a safety concern is not posed based on the Cmax 
values of the new formulation alone.  
Based on the results of study MDCO-ORI-15-01 in healthy volunteers, there was no evidence of an 
increase or change in TEAEs with a decrease in infusion time with the new formulation (Cohorts 2-5). 
However, the number of treated subjects is very limited (8 per Cohort) and limited to healthy subjects 
since different infusion times with the new formulation were not studied in ABSSSI patients. 
Excipient HPβCD 
The new formulation contains 2400 mg of HPβCD/vial which is a widely used modified cyclodextrin and 
a well characterised excipient used in other approved drugs. Safety data from studies ML-OR-102 and 
MDCO-ORI-15-01 did not reveal any TEAEs of renal impairment or renal failure.  Sections 4.2 und 4.4 
of the SmPC have been updated to include information on HPβCD. 
Since there were no new safety signals with the 1200 mg oritavancin formulation, the safety 
information for oritavancin 400 mg formulation is anticipated to form the basis of safety information for 
oritavancin new package labelling which is generally considered acceptable. However, it must be kept 
in mind that safety data for the new formulation are very limited and based on 52 ABSSSI patients and 
40 healthy volunteers included in studies ML-ORI-102 and MDCO-ORI-15-01. 
2.6.8.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the oritavancin new formulation with the shorter infusion time and a new excipient seems to 
have a comparable safety profile to the 400 mg approved formulation. Based on the submitted data 
and consistency of results across studies, there is no evidence of an increase or change in TEAEs with 
decrease of infusion time or based on the presence of HPβCD.  
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
The new RMP version (4.0) is being submitted as a part of line extension application. The RMP has 
been updated to include information on oritavancin new formulation: vial containing 1200 mg 
oritavancin powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. There is no change to the list of safety 
concerns.  
The following changes were introduced: 
Assessment report  
EMA/323178/2023  
Page 29/36 
 
 
 
- Part I has been updated to include the oritavancin NF; 
- Part II Module SII has been updated to include in vivo studies conducted to support the safety of 
oritavancin NF and nonclinical safety studies with HPβCD described in published literature; 
- Part II Module SV, SVII have been updated to include post-marketing exposure and safety data on 
oritavancin up to the Data Lock Point of this report; 
- Part VI has been updated accordingly. 
The invented name “Orbactiv” has been replaced with the new brand name “Tenkasi” throughout the 
document. 
The other changes are of minor nature. 
The RMP Part III-VI is acceptable. 
2.7.1.  Safety concerns 
2.7.1.1.  Summary of safety concerns  
No change to the safety concerns list has been proposed.  
This  RMP  version  includes  information  on  oritavancin  new  formulation:  vial  containing  1200  mg 
oritavancin powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. Oritavancin NF with its shorter infusion time, 
has a comparable safety profile to that of oritavancin 400 mg of powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion.  Since  there  were  no  new  safety  findings  with  the  oritavancin  NF,  no  change  to  the  safety 
concerns list has been proposed.

2.7.1.2.  Discussion on safety specification 
Cyclodextrins [e.g. HPβCD and SBECD (sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin, also called betadex sulfobutyl 
ether sodium)] are used as excipients also in other authorised drugs for intravenous application 
including the anti-infectives itraconazole (HPβCD as excipient), delafloxacin (SBECD as excipient) and 
remdesivir (SBECD as excipient). Considering that cyclodextrins are renally excreted, in patients with 
moderate to severe renal dysfunction accumulation of cyclodextrin may occur. The product information 
of the above-mentioned drugs reflects this information. Renal damage secondary to SBECD 
accumulation in patients with severe renal impairment [IV formulation] is an important potential risk 
included in the list of safety concerns of the RMP for delafloxacin. Safety in patients with severe renal 
impairment is a safety concern listed as missing information in the RMP for remdesivir, where it is 
stated that, the excipient betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium is renally cleared and accumulates in 
patients with decreased renal function. The safety of betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium in COVID-19 
Assessment report

patients with severe renal impairment is unknown; to further characterize this safety concern, 
additional pharmacovigilance activities are in place.  
In the response, the MAH has provided an explanation concerning the presence of HPβCD in the new 
formulation. No new risk related to the presence of HPβCD has been identified at present. Taking also 
into consideration the information proposed to be included in sections 4.2 and 4.4. it is considered 
acceptable. The MAH proposed to analyse safety information related to the new formulation in future 
PSURs. No RMP update is considered necessary at present.  
2.7.1.3.  Conclusions on the safety specification  
Safety Specification as per RMP version 4.0 are considered acceptable (no changes in the list of Safety 
Concerns). 
2.7.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan 
The pharmacovigilance plan includes routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: 
• 
Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires for oritavancin immunological 
(hypersensitivity) adverse events (Important Identified Risk), for oritavancin 
pseudomembranous colitis / CDAD adverse events (Important Potential Risks) and for 
oritavancin osteomyelitis adverse events (Important Potential Risk): 
The  aim  of  these  questionnaires  is  to  obtain  structured  and  detailed  information  on  reports  of  these 
adverse reactions. The forms are provided in Annex 4 of this RMP. 
• 
Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities: 
Not applicable. 
A review of the safety concerns is planned to be performed at each PSUR elaboration.

-  Recommendations to discontinue oritavancin and to institute appropriate 
supportive care if acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs during 
oritavancin infusion are reported in in SmPC section 4.4 . Before using 
oritavancin it is important to inquire carefully about previous 
hypersensitivity reactions to glycopeptides (e.g. vancomycin, 
telavancin). Due to the possibility of cross-hypersensitivity, there should 
be careful monitoring of patients with any history of glycopeptide 
hypersensitivity during and after the infusion. Serious hypersensitivity 
reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and anaphylactic shock have 
been reported with the use of oritavancin. 
-  The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5%) were: 
hypersensitivity reactions, infusion site reactions. ADRs related to

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reason: 
- the information given in the PI of the new formulation only slightly differs from the approved PI of 
the 400 mg formulation. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The new 1200 mg oritavancin formulation was developed to simplify the preparation for solution for 
infusion but to deliver the same dose as the currently approved 400 mg oritavancin formulation and to 
be administered for the same indication. 
Apart from the single-vial presentation, the new formulation has the advantage that the active 
substance can be diluted to a smaller volume (250 ml instead of 1000 ml) with either NS or D5W and 
infused over a shorter period of time (1 hour instead of 3 hours). 
Based on the results of study ML-ORI-102 oritavancin exposure in patients with ABSSSI is comparable 
between the two formulations indicating that efficacy data of the currently approved formulation can 
be applied to the new formulation. Increased Cmax values due to shorter infusion time are still 
comparable to PopPK-data derived from the Phase 3 studies conducted with the currently approved 
formulation and thus do not pose a safety concern.  
The safety profile of the currently approved 400 mg formulation has been well characterised during 
development and post-marketing. Safety data of the new formulations are limited and based on 52 
ABSSSI patients and 40 healthy volunteers included in the two Phase 1 studies ML-ORI-102 and 
MDCO-ORI-15-01. However, TEAS were comparable between treatment groups despite the reduced 
infusion time and presence of the excipient HPβCD and information on HPβCD were included in sections 
4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Benefit-Risk is positive,sche with a shelf-life of 4 years.  
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of Tenkasi 1200 mg solution for infusion is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety, the CHMP considers by consensus that the

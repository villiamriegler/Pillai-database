1.  Introduction 
On 29 August 2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study, in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The initial due date of this submission was 18 September 
2016. A letter informing of delay of this submission was sent to EMA on 16 September 2016, informing 
the EMA of the delay in the availability of the Clinical Study Report within 6 months from the last 
subject last visit, and hence a delay in this submission. 
Study Hib-MenCY-TT-016 (112931) is a phase IIIb, open, randomised, controlled, multicentre study 
conducted in the US to assess the co-administration of Rotarix with Hib-MenCY-TT (MenHibrix, GSK) at 
2 and 4 months of age, the co-administration of Prevnar 13 (Pfizer) with Hib-MenCY-TT at 2, 4 and 6 
months of age and the co-administration of Prevnar 13 and Havrix (GSK) with Hib-MenCY-TT at 12 to 
15 months of age.  
No changes to the Product Information of Rotarix are proposed. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study Hib-MenCY-TT-016 (112931) is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The formulation of Rotarix administered was the lyophilised formulation. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Following the introduction of Hib-conjugate and S. pneumoniae conjugate vaccines in the routine infant 
immunization schedule in the US, there has been a dramatic reduction in the incidence of diseases 
caused by Hib and S. pneumoniae. Neisseria meningitidis has become a leading cause of bacterial 
meningitis in the US, with serogroups B, C and Y being responsible for the majority of cases.  
In 2013, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed the burden of 
meningococcal disease among infants and children aged 0–59 months. The number of US infants at 
increased risk for meningococcal disease is small (estimated at 3,000–5,000), making a targeted high-
risk vaccination policy feasible and reasonable given the potential increased risk in these infants. In 
infants, not at increased risk for meningococcal disease, rates of this disease have declined in all age 
groups since 2000 and in 2011. The overall rate of meningococcal disease was at a historic low of 0.21 
per 100,000 population. In the US, during 1993–2011, average annual rates of meningococcal disease 
were higher among children aged 0 through 59 months (1.74 per 100,000 population) than in 
adolescents aged 11 through 19 years (0.57 per 100,000). The epidemiology of meningococcal disease 
is dynamic, and rates of disease could increase in the future, requiring a reassessment of immunization 
strategy.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

The Hib-MenCY-TT conjugate vaccine (MenHibrix) using Tetanus Toxoid (TT) as the carrier protein for 
the Hib and the meningococcal components was developed to be administered as a 4-dose vaccination 
series at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age. On June 14th, 2012, MenHibrix was approved by the FDA 
for use in infants. This vaccine is anticipated to allow vaccination against serogroups C and Y 
meningococcal disease without increasing the number of injections required to fully vaccinate a child 
according to the routine childhood schedule in the US. 
The MAH submitted a final report for Study Hib-MenCY-TT-016 (112931) which aims to demonstrate 
the acceptability of the co-administration of Rotarix, Prevnar 13 and Havrix with GSK’s Hib-MenCY-TT 
vaccine. Rotarix was administered to both study groups at month 0 and 2. 
The first primary objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of anti-PRP concentration of 
a 4-dose vaccination course of Hib-MenCY-TT co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix compared to 
a 3-dose vaccination course of PedvaxHIB co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix. The other 
primary confirmatory objectives was to demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of Rotarix IgA GMCs, 
S. pneumoniae GMCs and anti-HAV concentrations. 
The study was initiated on 19-February-2014 and completed on 18-March-2016. The data lock point 
was on 16-March-2018. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study Hib-MenCY-TT-016 (112931): A phase IIIb, open, randomized, controlled, multicenter study to 
assess the coadministration of Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’) with Hib-MenCY-TT 
(GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’ Meningococcal Groups C and Y and Haemophilus b Tetanus Toxoid 
Conjugate Vaccine) at 2 and 4 months of age, the co-administration of Prevnar 13 (Pfizer) with Hib-
MenCY-TT at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and the co-administration of Prevnar 13 and Havrix 
(GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’) with Hib-MenCY-TT at 12 to 15 months of age. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Before concluding on the primary objectives for Rotarix, Prevnar 13, and Havrix, the following 
objective was to be reached: 
Co-primary objectives 
- 
To demonstrate the non-inferiority of a four dose vaccination course of Hib-MenCY-TT 
coadministered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix compared to a three dose vaccination course of  
PedvaxHIB co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix in terms of anti-PRP concentration.  
Criterion for non-inferiority (1 month post dose 4): Lower limit of the standardized 
asymptotic 95% CI for the difference (HibCY group minus the PedHIB group) in the percentage 
of subjects with anti-PRP concentrations ≥1.0 µg/mL is ≥-10% (clinical limit for non-
inferiority). 
To conclude independently on the following primary objectives of Epoch 001 or Epoch 002, a 
Bonferroni correction was to be used to evaluate these objectives (2.5% two-sided for Epoch 001 and 
2.5% two-sided for Epoch 002). As per the hierarchical procedure, the first primary objective would 
have to be reached to conclude on the second primary objective of that Epoch.

Study population /Sample size 
The study population involved healthy infants between, and including, 6 and 12 weeks years of age at 
the time of the first vaccination, born after a gestation period of 37 weeks, who had not received 
vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, diphtheria, tetanus, 
pertussis, rotavirus, pneumococcus, hepatitis A and/or poliovirus and who had not received more than 
one previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine which had to be administered at least 30 days prior to 
enrolment.  
Subjects with history of intussusceptions or uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal 
tract that would predispose for intussusceptions were excluded from enrolment. 
Blinding 
This study was conducted in an open manner, since the presentation and number of vaccines to be 
administered per visit differed for each group. The laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing was 
blinded to the treatment, and codes were used to link the subject and study (without any link to the 
treatment attributed to the subject) to each sample. 
Treatments 
600 subjects were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to either HibCY or PedHIB groups:  
-  HibCY group: Hib-MenCY-TT, Prevnar 13 + Pediarix + Rotarix at Months 0, 2; Hib-MenCY-
TT, Prevnar 13 + Pediarix at Month 4; Hib-MenCY-TT, Prevnar 13 + Havrix at Month 10-13; 
and Havrix at Month 16-19. 
-  PedHIB group: PedvaxHIB, Prevnar 13 + Pediarix + Rotarix at Months 0, 2; Prevnar 13 + 
Pediarix at Month 4; PedvaxHIB, Prevnar 13 + Havrix at Month 10-13; and Havrix at Month 
16-19. 
At enrolment, the subjects were associated to one of the three blood sampling schedules: 
- 
The first 200 subjects were enrolled in the blood sample sub-cohort 3 with a blood draw one 
month post-third dose at Month 5 (Visit 4), one month post-fourth dose (Visit 6) and one 
month after the second Havrix vaccination (Visit 8). 
- 
The next 200 subjects were enrolled in the blood sample sub-cohort 2 with a blood draw before 
the third vaccination dose at Month 4 (Visit 3), one month post-fourth dose (Visit 6) and one 
month after the second Havrix vaccination (Visit 8) 
- 
The last 200 subjects were enrolled in the blood sample sub-cohort 1 with a blood draw before 
the third vaccination dose at Month 4 (Visit 3), one month post-third dose at Month 5 (Visit 4) 
and one month post-fourth dose (Visit 6).

Statistical Methods 
Demographic characteristics (age at each dose in weeks, gender, geographical ancestry, ethnicity, 
height [cm], weight [kg], body mass index [BMI in kg/m²] at first dose, subcohort, vaccination history, 
center), timing between Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine constitution and vaccination at each dose, cohort 
description and withdrawal status were summarised by group using descriptive statistics: 
- 
Frequency tables were generated for categorical variables such as geographical ancestry or 
timing between Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine constitution and vaccination;

-  Mean, median and standard error were provided for continuous data such as age.  
- 
The distribution of subjects enrolled among the study sites was tabulated as a whole and per 
group. 
Analysis of immunogenicity: 
The primary analysis of immunogenicity was based on the ATP cohorts for immunogenicity. If, for any 
vaccine group, the percentage of enrolled subjects with serological results excluded from this ATP 
cohort was more than 5%, a second analysis based on the Total Vaccinated Cohort was performed to 
support the ATP analysis. 
Within groups assessment 
For each treatment group and for each antibody assessed at the corresponding timepoint: 
- 
Percentage of subjects with antibody concentration or titre ≥ endpoint specific threshold value 
with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. 
-  Geometric Mean antibody Concentrations or Titres (GMCs or GMTs) with 95% CIs were 
tabulated. 
The above analyses were performed by gender and geographical ancestry. In addition, antibody 
concentrations or titres were evaluated using reverse cumulative curves (RCC) for each antibody 
assessed. 
Between groups assessment 
Non-inferiority of Hib-MenCY-TT post-dose 4 when co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix 
compared to PedvaxHIB post-dose 3 co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix with respect to anti-
PRP was evaluated through: 
-  Computation of the asymptotic standardized 95.0% CIs for the difference in the percentage of 
subjects with anti-PRP ≥ 1.0 μg/ml (HibCY group minus the PedHIB group) 1 month after the 
4th dose of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccination and 1 month after the 3rd dose of PedvaxHIB 
vaccination. Indication of non-inferiority of Hib-MenCY-TT co-administered with Prevnar 13 and 
Havrix versus PedvaxHIB co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix was to be a lower limit 
of the 95.0% CI greater than or equal to the pre-defined clinical limit of -10%. 
Non-inferiority of Rotarix when co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT compared to Rotarix 
coadministered with PedvaxHIB with respect to anti-Rota IgA was evaluated through: 
-  Computation of the asymptotic standardized 97.5% CIs for the GMC ratio of subjects with anti-
Rota IgA (HibCY group over the PedHIB group) 2 months after the 2nd dose of Rotarix 
vaccination. Indication of non-inferiority of Rotarix co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT versus 
Rotarix coadministered with PedvaxHIB was to be a lower limit of the 97.5% CI greater than or 
equal to the pre-defined clinical limit of 0.5. 
Non-inferiority of Prevnar 13 when co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT compared to Prevnar 13 
coadministered with PedvaxHIB with respect to anti-S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 
9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F was evaluated through: 
-  Computation of the asymptotic standardized 97.5% CIs for the GMC ratio of subjects with anti- 
S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (HibCY group

over the PedHIB group) 1 month after the 3rd dose of Prevnar 13 vaccination. Indication of 
noninferiority of Prevnar 13 co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT versus Prevnar 13 co-
administered with PedvaxHIB was to be a lower limit of the 97.5% CI greater than or equal to 
the pre-defined clinical limit of 0.5. 
Non-inferiority of Havrix when co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT compared to Havrix coadministered 
with PedvaxHIB with respect to anti-HAV was evaluated through: 
-  Computation of the asymptotic standardized 97.5% CIs for the difference in the percentage of 
subjects with anti-HAV ≥15 mIU/mL (HibCY group rate minus PedHIB group rate) one month 
after primary vaccination. Indication of non-inferiority of Hib-MenCY-TT was to be a lower limit 
of the 97.5% CI greater than or equal to the pre-defined clinical limit of -10%. 
Non-inferiority of Prevnar 13 when co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT compared to Prevnar 13 
coadministered with PedvaxHIB with respect to anti- S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 
9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F were to be evaluated through: 
-  Computation of the asymptotic standardized 97.5% CIs for the GMC ratio of subjects with anti- 
S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (HibCY group 
over the PedHIB group) 1 month after the 4th dose of Prevnar 13 vaccination. Indication of 
non-inferiority of Prevnar 13 co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT versus Prevnar 13 
coadministered with PedvaxHIB was to be a lower limit of the 97.5% CI greater than or equal 
to the pre-defined clinical limit of 0.5. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 600 subjects who were vaccinated in the 27 study centers in the US, 462 completed the study 
(232 in HibCY group and 230 in group PedHIB group). A total of 138 subjects (65 in HibCY group and 
73 in group PedHIB group) were withdrawn from the study. The main reasons for withdrawal were: 
consent withdrawal (not due to an adverse event), migrated/moved from study area, and lost to 
follow-up (subjects with incomplete vaccination course). 
Table: Study population (Total vaccinated cohort) 
The first subject was enrolled in the study on 19-February-2014 and the last study visit was on 18-
March-2016.

Assessor’s comment 
The immunogenicity profile of Rotarix is consistent with earlier data. 
Safety results 
Solicited adverse events 
Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom in both groups (in 90.9% of the 
subjects in HibCY group and 94.9% of the subjects in PedHIB group [after 69.1% and 78.4% of doses,

respectively]). Grade 3 irritability was reported in 14.0% of the subjects of HibCY and 22.4% of the 
subjects of PedHIB group [after 5.9% and 10.4% of doses, respectively]. All other grade 3 solicited 
general symptoms were reported in 10.8% or fewer subjects (5.4% or fewer doses). Most of the 
reported grade 3 solicited general symptoms were considered by the investigator to be related to 
vaccination.

Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
Overall, 19 subjects reported SAEs from dose 1 up to study end: 8 (2.7%) in HibCY group, and 11 
(3.6%) in PedHIB group. All SAEs were considered by the investigator as not causally related to the 
vaccination. 
One death (sudden infant death syndrome) was reported in the HibCY group (158 days after post-dose 
3). This event was considered by the investigator as not causally related to the vaccination. 
Adverse events led to premature discontinuation/withdrawal from the study in 6 subjects (1 death 
[sudden infant death syndrome] in the HibCY group and 5 nonfatal SAEs in PedHIB group). 
Assessor’s comment 
Rotarix was administered to both study groups and co-administered with other study vaccines. The 
safety and reactogenicity profile of Rotarix could therefore not be assessed independently.  
No new safety events were reported.  
The safety and reactogenicity results were consistent with the known safety profile of Hib-MenCY-TT 
vaccine. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The current study evaluated the immunogenicity of Rotarix when administered according to a 2-dose 
schedule in 6-12 weeks old subjects in 27 study centres in the US. Rotarix was co-administered with 
DTPa-HBV-IPV, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and either Hib-MenCY-TT or Hib vaccine.

All the co-primary objectives of the study were met as the pre-defined criteria have been reached. 
Since the first primary objective for Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine with respect to the percentage of subjects 
with anti-PRP concentration was met, the rest of the co-primary objectives for Rotarix, Prevnar 13, and 
Havrix were also assessed and these were equally met. 
Anti-rotavirus IgA concentrations ≥ 20 U/mL was observed in at least 81.3% of subjects in the HibCY 
group and 80.1% of subjects in the PedHIB group. 
The immunogenicity profile of Rotarix is consistent with earlier data. 
Rotarix was administered to both study groups and co-administered with other study vaccines. The 
safety and reactogenicity profile of Rotarix could therefore not be assessed independently, but no new 
safety events were reported. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
This study investigated the acceptability of the co-administration of Rotarix, Prevnar 13 and Havrix 
with the candidate Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine. 
The non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of Rotarix and Prevnar 13 when co-administered with Hib-
MenCY-TT as compared to the immunogenicity of Rotarix and Prevnar 13 co-administered with US-
licensed PedvaxHIB and the non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of Havrix and Prevnar 13 when co-
administered with Hib-MenCY-TT as compared to the immunogenicity of Havrix and Prevnar 13 co-
administered with PedvaxHIB, were demonstrated. 
Rotarix was administered to both study groups and co-administered with other study vaccines. The 
safety and reactogenicity profile of Rotarix could therefore not be assessed independently, but no new 
safety events were reported. 
Based on the presented immunogenicity and safety results the benefit risk balance for Rotarix remains 
positive. The presented data support the previously presented data. No regulatory action is considered 
necessary based on the current study results.

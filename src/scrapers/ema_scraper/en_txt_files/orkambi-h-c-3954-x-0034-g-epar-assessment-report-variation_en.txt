2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Orkambi is currently indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. This line extension application is for an age adapted 
formulation and includes an extension of indication to children 2 years and older, from the currently approved 
target population 6 years and older. The same genotypic subpopulation of cystic fibrosis (homozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the CFTR gene) is indicated. 
Orkambi is authorised in the EU as two fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet strengths: LUM 200-mg/IVA 125-mg 
FDC tablet and LUM 100-mg/IVA 125-mg FDC tablet. Both are for oral administration, given as 2 tablets daily 
every 12 hours.  
The line extension proposes an additional presentation of oral granules for children 2-5y. Two strengths are 
proposed: 100 mg/125 mg granules in sachet and 150 mg/188 mg granules in sachet. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Cystic fibrosis is a chronically debilitating, autosomal recessive disease associated with serious morbidity and a 
high rate of premature mortality and at present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately 70,000 individuals 
worldwide, including approximately 30,000 individuals in the United States (US), 32,000 individuals in the 
European Union (EU), 4,000 individuals in Canada, and 3,100 individuals in Australia. The incidence and 
prevalence of CF varies between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the Caucasian populations of 
North America and Europe than in Asian and African populations. 
The median predicted age of survival for patients with CF born in 2014 is 40.0 years of age. Although expected 
survival has doubled over the past 30 years due to advances in treatment, of those who died in 2014, the median 
age at death ranged from 27.0 to 32.4 years in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia.   
Orkambi is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of CF patients 6 years and older who are homozygous 
for the mutation F508del, the commonest disease-causing CFTR mutation. In the EU, approximately 80% of 
patients with CF have F508del on at least one allele and 40% are homozygous for F508del. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulatory (CFTR) gene that result in absence 
or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride ion (CL-) 
channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, including lungs, pancreas, intestinal tract, liver, and vas

deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. CFTR 
mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR function. Stop codon 
mutations (class I) result in a truncated non-functional CFTR, class II mutations consist of aberrantly folded 
CFTR protein that is degraded by the cell quality control system, while class III mutations lead to defective 
regulation of the CFTR protein and, consequently, the absence of CFTR function. These three classes usually lead 
to a classic CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency. CFTR mutations that lead to defective chloride 
conductance are grouped together in class IV. Class V mutations interfere with normal transcription, thereby 
reducing the amount of otherwise normal CFTR. These latter two classes are mostly associated with a milder 
expression of the disease. The most prevalent mutation is an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a 
loss of phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR) and it is a Class II mutation: it prevents 
most of the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no chloride transport. 
Patients who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR have little or no CFTR protein at the cell surface and hence 
suffer from a severe form of CF disease. The failure of the mutated CFTR to function properly in the lungs result 
in a cycle of mucus plugging, infection, and inflammation that leads to irreversible structural changes in the 
lungs and eventually respiratory failure, the most common cause of death for patients with CF. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The biochemical defect of defective chloride channel function is present from birth, with the sequelae of lung, 
pancreatic and other organ involvement emerging progressively throughout childhood and into adulthood. 
The indication is restricted to the homozygous F508del-CFTR genotypic subpopulation of CF who have a severe 
form of the disease due to the very low level of chloride channel function. Even in this severely affected 
subgroup, however, lung injury proceeds at a slow rate and pulmonary function as measured by spirometry can 
be apparently normal in the younger age group. Nonetheless, even with normal spirometry, patients can have 
pulmonary structural aberrations on computed tomography (CT) scans. Consistent with this, impaired lung 
clearance index (LCI), which measures the degree of small airway disease by assessing ventilation 
inhomogeneity, can be demonstrated in paediatric patients with normal spirometry. Because the underlying 
molecular defect is the same in this age group and older patients, it was anticipated that LUM/IVA may be 
efficacious in this population to slow or pre-empt disease progression by correcting the biochemical defect in the 
chloride channel protein. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current CF treatments include CFTR modulators and enzyme supplements, mucolytics, antibiotics, and 
vitaminsTreatment guidelines recommend CFTR modulator and non-modulator medications concomitantly 
administered to maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of infections and exacerbations, and 
improve quality of life. CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene 
that affect the production of the CFTR protein.  Drugs that target the underlying defect in the CFTR protein, CFTR 
modulators, target specific defects caused by mutations in the CFTR gene and thus treat the underlying cause of 
the disease. The main goal of therapy is to maintain and restore respiratory function. There are two main types 
of modulators, potentiators and correctors. Potentiators recover the function of the CFTR protein at the apical 
surface of epithelial cells that is disrupted in class III and IV genetic mutations, while correctors improve 
intracellular processing of the CFTR protein, increasing surface expression, in class II mutations. A third type is 
production correctors or read-through agents, which promote transcription of CFTR in class I mutations.

Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) and Symkevi (texacaftor/ivacaftor, 
TEZ/IVA) are the CFTR modulators approved for specific age groups of CF patients with specific mutations. 
Ivacaftor (in Kalydeco as mono-component and in Orkambi and Symkevi as part of fixed dose combinations) is 
a potentiator, the active substance lumacaftor and tezacaftor are correctors (present in the fixed dose 
combinations).   
About the product  
Orkambi is a fixed drug combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor that combines corrector and potentiator action 
to provide a partial reversal of the biochemical defect in the chloride channel due to mutation in the CFTR gene.  
Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) through increased gating 
activity, resulting in increased chloride transport. F508del-CFTR is a Class II mutation leading to an aberrantly 
folded protein susceptible to defective intracellular processing and trafficking that prevents most of the CFTR 
protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no chloride transport. The very small amount of 
F508del-CFTR protein that reaches the cell surface also has defective channel gating and decreased stability at 
the cell surface. Patients who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR have little or no CFTR protein at the cell surface 
and hence suffer from a severe form of CF disease. 
Lumacaftor is presumed to partially correct the folding defect in F508del-CFTR, facilitating its cellular processing 
and trafficking, allowing the protein to reach the cell surface. The channel gating activity of F508del-CFTR 
delivered to the cell surface by lumacaftor can be potentiated by ivacaftor to further enhance chloride transport. 
When added in vitro to F508del/F508del human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE), the magnitude of chloride 
transport observed with the combination of lumacaftor and either acute or chronic ivacaftor treatment was 
greater than that observed with lumacaftor alone. 
The line extension is supported by a new FDC of Orkambi in a new presentation: oral granules, to extend use in 
the paediatric population from the current 6 years or older to younger children i.e.  2 -5 years. The line extension 
dossier is supported by three clinical (uncontrolled) studies and population PK. 
The claimed indication is: 
Orkambi granules are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in children aged 2 years and older who 
are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
The approved indication is: 
Orkambi granules are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in children aged 2 years and older who 
are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).  
The applicant has had one CHMP protocol assistance procedure dated 26 February 2015 on clinical aspects. The 
purpose was to seek the CHMP’s input and concurrence on the planned clinical development plan for subjects 6 
through 11 years of age to support a future application to extend the Marketing Authorization for LUM/IVA 
combination therapy to include patients with CF 6 years of age and older who are homozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This  is  a  centralised  line  extension  application  of  the  currently  authorised  Orkambi  200mg/125  mg  and 
100mg/125mg  lumacaftor/ivacaftor  fixed-dose  combination  (FDC)  coated  tablets  for  the  addition  of  a  new 
dosage form, oral granules, in two strengths supporting the extension of the currently approved indication, to 
children 2-5 year old. 
The finished product is presented as granules in a sachet containing 100/125 mg or 150/188 mg of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor as active substances to enable weight-based dosing. 
Other ingredients are: hypromellose acetate succinate, sodium lauryl sulfate, croscarmellose sodium and 
microcrystalline cellulose and povidone (K30).  
The product is available in a foil laminate [biaxially-oriented polyethyleneterephthalate/polyethylene/ 
foil/polyethylene (BOPET/ PE/Foil/PE)] sachet, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  active  substances  lumacaftor  and  ivacaftor  used  to  manufacture  the  granules  are  the  same  used  to 
manufacture the currently approved FDC tablets. As a result, no new information has been provided within this 
line extension application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product consists of granules in a sachet for oral administration. The granules are a FDC product of 
the  active  ingredients  lumacaftor  and  ivacaftor  in  a  single  oral  dosage  form.  The  same  fixed-ratio  granule 
formulation is used for both granule strengths of 100 mg lumacaftor /125 mg ivacaftor and 150 mg lumacaftor 
/188 mg ivacaftor. The two strengths are determined by the fill weight of the fixed-ratio granules which are 
heat-sealed in foil laminated sachets. For administration, the granules are emptied from the sachets and mixed 
with a small amount of soft food for oral administration.  
The composition of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules has been presented. Lumacaftor active substance is 
provided as a crystalline solid. Ivacaftor active substance is provided as an amorphous spray-dried dispersion 
(SDD) intermediate.

Lumacaftor  active  substance  is  provided  as  a  crystalline  solid.  Ivacaftor  active  substance  is  provided  as  an 
amorphous spray dried dispersion (SDD) intermediate. No new data regarding the active substances or ivacaftor 
SDD is provided with this line extension application. 
The  lumacaftor/ivacaftor  fix-dosed  combination  (FDC)  granules  contain  excipients  used  in  the  commercial 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets, 100/125 mg and 200/125 mg. Therefore, no additional compatibility studies 
were conducted for the granules. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no excipients from animal origin or novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
As  for  the  FDC  tablets,  finished  product  and  manufacturing  process  development  were  conducted  under  a 
Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules was to obtain, bioavailable, 
safe  and  efficacious  immediate  release  fixed-dose  combination  granules  of  100  mg  lumacaftor  /  125  mg 
ivacaftor and 150 mg lumacaftor / 188 mg ivacaftor  for oral administration having at least 24 month shelf life 
at room temperature packaged in sachets. 
Due to the low aqueous solubilities of lumacaftor and ivacaftor (< 1μg/mL) and the insufficient physical stability 
of  amorphous  ivacaftor  in  aqueous  media,  neither  a  solution  nor  a  suspension  formulation  of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor  fixed  dose  combination  (FDC)  was  feasible.  Therefore,  a  granule  dosage  form  was 
developed for ease of administration to paediatric patients.  
Potential  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs)  for  the  lumacaftor  active  substance,  ivacaftor  SDD  and  the 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules have been described.  
The lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules CQAs and their impact on quality, safety, and/or efficacy is summarized 
in Table 3.

An  initial  risk  assessment  was  performed  on  the  incoming  materials,  process  and  lumacaftor/ivacaftor  FDC 
granules to determine which materials and process steps could potentially impact the CQAs. Risk assessment, 
prior knowledge, and screening experiments are used to design multivariate experiments that evaluate main 
effects and interactions. 
Data  from  QbD  studies  were  analyzed  to  determine  the  design  space  that  ensures  all  CQAs  are  within 
acceptance limits.  The process knowledge gained throughout QbD development formed the basis of the overall 
product control strategies for active substance and finished product. The control strategy includes control of 
input material attributes, critical process parameters, in-process controls, and product specifications. 
A  summary  of  the  manufacturing  process  design  space  for  the  lumacaftor/ivacaftor  FDC  granules  finished 
product was presented.  
For oral administration, the granules are emptied from the sachets and mixed with a small amount of soft food 
or liquid. 
A  summary  of  formulations  used  throughout  clinical  development  has  been  provided.  They  included  75  mg 
lumacaftor / 125 mg ivacaftor FDC granules in amber glass vials (used in Phase 1 studies), 100 mg lumacaftor 
/ 125 mg ivacaftor and 150 mg lumacaftor / 188 mg ivacaftor FDC granules in capsules (used in phases 1 and 
3) or sachets (used in phase 3 studies). 
In  order  to  evaluate  the  sensory  attributes  of  the  oral  granules,  a  human  sensory  study  with  adults  was 
conducted with lumacaftor active substance, ivacaftor SDD and lumacaftor/ ivacaftor FDC granules. They were 
dosed alone and after mixing with small amounts of soft foods or liquids for administration. As the formulation 
is  intended  for  paediatric  patients,  soft  foods  (carrot  puree,  yogurt  and  applesauce)  that  are  commonly 
administered  to  young  children  were  tested.  Results  indicated  that  the  FDC  granules  showed  a  moderate 
intensity bitterness profile that was attributed primarily to the ivacaftor SDD. Mixing the lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
FDC granules with small amounts (~5mL) of soft foods (carrot puree, plain non-fat yogurt and applesauce) for 
oral administration significantly reduced the bitterness and improved the overall sensory profile of the finished 
product. Water provided only a slight reduction in negative attributes. Based on the results of the sensory study, 
it  was  concluded  that  the  lumacaftor/ivacaftor  FDC  granules  dosed  with  soft  foods  have  acceptable 
palatability.This was confirmed in a pivotal Phase 3 study.  
Dissolution is a critical quality attribute (CQA) of the FDC immediate release granules, verifying that the desired 
release profiles of the active ingredients are maintained.  
Two independent in vitro dissolution methods were developed for testing the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets, 
one  for  each  active  ingredient.    Since  the  paediatric  FDC  granules  have  the  same  composition  as  the 
intragranular component of the paediatric FDC tablets, the applicability of the FDC paediatric tablet dissolution 
methods were assessed for use in the FDC granules. Based on previous knowledge from the paediatric FDC 
tablet process, only potentially critical process parameters and product attributes that are unique to the FDC 
granules were assessed for dissolution, including the following:  
Assessment report  
EMA/843650/2018 
Page 12/65 
  
  
 
• ivacaftor spray dried dispersion (SDD) bulk density  
• granule particle size  
• granule water content  
• stability changes under stressed conditions  
Both dissolution methods have shown discriminating ability against meaningful manufacturing variations and 
are considered suitable for their intended use as the primary release and stability quality control methods for 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor  FDC  granules.  In  addition,  with  available  in  vivo  data,  the  clinical  relevance  of  both 
dissolution methods has been established. 
The  primary  packaging  is  foil  laminate  [biaxially-oriented  polyethylene  terephthalate/polyethylene/ 
foil/polyethylene (BOPET/ PE/Foil/PE)] sachet. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use 
of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
As indicated above, the composition and the manufacturing process of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC bulk 
granules is the same as the manufacturing process of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules used in the 
commercial 100 mg lumacaftor / 125 mg ivacaftor FDC tablets. The novelty in the proposed product is the 
packaging into sachets. The lumacaftor active substance is provided as a crystalline, jet-milled material and the 
ivacaftor active substance is provided as an amorphous spray-dried dispersion (SDD). The same fixed-ratio 
granule formulation is used for both granule strengths of 100 mg lumacaftor / 125 mg ivacaftor and 150 mg 
lumacaftor / 188 mg ivacaftor. The two strengths are determined by the fill weight of the fixed-ratio granules 
which are heat-sealed in foil laminated sachets 
The process consists of incoming material screening, intra-granular (IG) blending, twin-screw wet granulation 
(TSWG), fluid bed drying (FBD) and milling. The IG blending is performed in a non-continuous batch mode, while 
TSWG, FBD and milling are performed in a continuous mode. The sachet packaging process to manufacture the 
finished lumacaftor / ivacaftor FDC granules finished product is a single unit operation using a sachet filler 
system.  
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process, equipment, formula and site are common to the Orkambi paediatric tablets. As 
such, the process is sufficiently validated until the bulk granules are obtained. The filling process is new and, as 
such, will be conducted before marketing in line with the process validation scheme provided. Major steps of the 
manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Overall, it has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
As  indicated  above  a  design  space  comprising  several  unit  operations  has  been  developed.  The  available 
development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully 
support the proposed design space.

Product specification 
The finished product release specifications shown in Table 5 include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance, identification (IR), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur., HPLC), 
water content (KF), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), granules particle size (laser diffraction), microbial limits 
(TAMC, TYMC, E. coli) (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications through traditional final 
product release testing.  
Physical form at release is effectively controlled via limits on the incoming lumacaftor active substance and 
ivacaftor SDD and process controls. It has been demonstrated that the manufacture processing conditions, 
including short periods of water contact (wet granulation), temperature elevation (drying) and mechanical 
impacts (milling), do not change the physical form of lumacaftor and ivacaftor SDD. Physical form is a critical 
quality attribute for the FDC granules to ensure bioavailability; however, lumacaftor and ivacaftor SDD are 
physically stable during manufacture of the FDC granules. All samples were tested for physical form during QbD 
experiments and did not show lumacaftor Form II or crystalline ivacaftor. To date, all batches manufactured for 
clinical use and formal stability conform to the expected physical form on release. The physical form of 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor has also been demonstrated on stability by ICH stability studies and a forced 
crystallization study; therefore, physical form testing for FDC granules has been omitted from the specification. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor FDC granules was assessed according 
to the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities using a risk based approach. The risk assessment considered 
the potential inputs from both lumacaftor and ivacaftor active substances and ivacaftor SDD (including solvents, 
reagents, excipients, and equipment), water, excipients, manufacturing equipment and container closure 
systems to determine the overall content of elemental impurities in the lumacaftor / ivacaftor FDC granules. This 
risk assessment and confirmatory testing demonstrates that the risk of elemental impurities in the lumacaftor / 
ivacaftor granules is low and the product will consistently meet the ICH Q3D requirements. Therefore, no 
additional controls on elemental impurities are required. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 5 commercial scale batches of each strength confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  three commercial  scale  batches of  each  strength  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  12 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 
ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Orkambi 100/125 mg or 150/188 
mg granules are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed 
for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  water  content  and  physical 
form. Microbial limits (TAMC, TYMC and E. coli) and water activity were tested on batches stored at 30 ºC / 75% 
RH. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Assessment report  
EMA/843650/2018 
Page 14/65 
  
  
The stability data show that the finished product is  stable when packaged in the configuration proposed for 
commercial distribution under all storage conditions.  All results met the acceptance criteria for the attributes 
evaluated. The X-ray powder diffraction data from all of the formal stability studies confirm the presence of 
lumacaftor Form I, absence of lumacaftor Form II and crystalline ivacaftor at all test points under all storage 
conditions. 
Photostability  as  per  ICH  Q1B,  Option  2,  was  not  performed  with  lumacaftor  /  ivacaftor  granules  as  the 
commercial container closure is light protective. This is accepted since from the photostability testing of the 
tables it was confirmed that they are stable. 
In addition, in-use stability studies were conducted to establish stability of granules mixed with common foods 
that might be used for administration.  
Chemical and physical stability of granules mixed with small volumes (~5 mL) of selected liquids and soft foods 
were evaluated by testing assay and degradation products, dissolution, and physical form. The test results at 1 
hour after mixing the FDC granules with water, apple juice, applesauce, carrot puree, fat free yogurt, infant 
formula  and  chocolate  pudding  demonstrated  acceptable  chemical  stability.  No  change  in  dissolution  was 
observed after mixing the FDC granules with the selected liquid, vegetable puree and fat containing foods, i.e., 
apple sauce, carrot puree, and whole milk yogurt. No physical form change of lumacaftor active substance or 
ivacaftor SDD was observed for FDC granules mixed with fat free foods. However, mixing FDC granules with fat 
containing  foods  (e.g.,  infant  formula  and  chocolate  pudding)  showed  formation  of  ivacaftor:triglyceride 
cocrystals. Ivacaftor SDD is known to form co-crystals with triglycerides when mixed with fat-containing foods. 
However,  co-crystals  prepared  had  solubilities  in  Fed  State  Simulated  Intestinal  Fluid  (FeSSIF)  at  37°C 
comparable  to  the  solubility  of  the  ivacaftor  SDD  present  in  the  granules,  indicating  that  the  ivacaftor 
triglyceride co-crystals are expected to have equivalent bioavailability to ivacaftor SDD. In addition, phase 3 
studies included fat containing foods in the food selection for administration. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years in the intended container closure system as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. Once mixed, the mixture has been shown to be stable for one 
hour. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. This line extension is based on data that has been submitted for the approved 
100 / 125 mg FDC tablets and any changes relevant to the granules has been provided as replacement, 
additions or revised documents. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished 
product and their manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for several manufacturing steps. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, 
and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH has made reference to previous clinical development of lumacaftor, ivacaftor and in combination, 
which were supported by appropriate pharmacology, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, metabolism and 
toxicology studies, submitted as part of the original Marketing Authorisation Application for Orkambi and for the 
clinical development and registration for Kalydeco.  As these non-clinical data have been previously assessed 
and approved, they were not discussed in detail here. However, nonclinical safety data from toxicity studies 
were previously submitted to support the proposed indication extension of Orkambi in the 6- through 
11-year-old age group (EMEA/H/C/003954/X/0020). These studies also support the current proposed indication 
aimed at CF patients 2 to 5 years of age and were included in this assessment for completeness. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Not applicable 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Not applicable 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
In the juvenile rat study, lumacaftor at 500 mg/kg/day was associated with mortality in one male animal on 
post-natal day 10. Macroscopic and microscopic effects observed were suggestive of postnatal hypoglycaemia 
which may have been associated with a failure of suckling. No other target organ toxicity was observed at 125 
and 250 mg/kg/day and therefore the dose of 250 mg/kg/day is deemed to be the no observed adverse effect 
level. The exposure to lumacaftor observed at this dose represents an approximate 5-fold safety factor to that 
seen in subjects aged 2 to 5 years in clinical study 115. The results of the juvenile toxicity do not affect the 
overall conclusions on the potential toxicity of lumacaftor and therefore no amendments to the SmPC are 
required and none have been made in this regard. The SmPC for the proposed products is considered to be 
acceptable.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) was submitted for ivacaftor. 
Assessment report  
EMA/843650/2018 
Page 16/65 
  
  
A Phase I estimation of exposure showed that an evaluation of the persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity 
(PBT) of VX-770 was required (log octanol-water partition coefficient >4.5). These studies were conducted 
under Phase II Tier A and B. The outcome of the Phase II Tier A environmental effects assessment in algae, 
daphnia, fish and microorganisms confirmed that VX-770 is unlikely to represent a risk to surface water, 
groundwater or to microorganisms. However, a bioaccumulation study in fish has yet to be finalised. 
The outcome of the Phase II Tier B terrestrial effects assessment in microorganisms, plants, earthworms and 
Collembola confirmed that VX-770 is unlikely to represent a risk to the terrestrial environment. 
A final lumacaftor ERA will be provided in March 2019 once all the studies with lumacaftor are completed, as 
some studies assessing the impact of lumacaftor on the environment are still ongoing. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new issues have been identified from a non-clinical perspective and juvenile data suitably supports this 
application. A definitive assessment on the potential risk of ivacaftor and lumacaftor to the environment cannot 
be made at this time as data from ongoing studies will to be submitted in 2019. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
As a result of the above considerations, the lack of available data does not allow to conclude definitively on the 
potential risk of ivacaftor and lumacaftor to the environment following approval of this line extension. The MAH 
has, however, already made a commitment to perform the required studies as part of an agreed follow-up 
measure, which is acceptable. 
Overall, the available nonclinical data on lumacaftor and ivacaftor support the proposed use in children above 
the age of 2 years. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried 
out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor; LUM/IVA) 200mg/125mg film-coated tablet was approved in the EU on 19 
November 2015 for the following indication: treatment of CF in patients aged 12 years and older who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. Orkambi 100mg/125mg film-coated tablet was further 
approved in the EU on 8 January 2018 for the following indication extension: treatment of CF in patients aged 6 
years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.  
The new proposed strength and dosage form are as follows: 
Orkambi (Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor) 100 mg/125 mg granules in sachet  
Orkambi (Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor) 150 mg/188 mg granules in sachet 
The indication proposed for the above is as follows:  
Orkambi granules are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in children aged 2 years and older who 
are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. 
This line extension application is for the addition of a new dosage form, granules, in 2 strengths supporting an 
extension of indication, i.e. extension of the currently approved age range to include 2-5 years. The new 
Assessment report

proposed strength and dosage form i.e. Orkambi (Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor) 100 mg/125 mg granules in sachet and 
150 mg/188 mg granules in sachet have a posology as proposed below:  
• One sachet of 100-mg/125-mg of LUM/IVA every 12 hours for patients weighing less than 14 kg  
• One sachet of 150-mg/188-mg of LUM/IVA every 12 hours for patients weighing 14 kg or greater 
PK modelling informed the altered ratio of LUM:IVA in the new strength granules intended for the younger age 
group.  Although decreased IVA clearance would be anticipated with decreasing body weight, this is offset by an 
increase in IVA clearance due to increased CYP3A4 induction from increased LUM exposure with decreasing body 
weight. Given that IVA is a CYP3A4 substrate, this will tend to reduce IVA exposure in patients with lower body 
weight. This is the essential basis for maintaining the IVA dose at the same level in the two tablet strengths. The 
posology and dosing have been reflected in the SmPC.  
PK data to support the line extension are mainly derived from two clinical studies (study 115, an open label 
uncontrolled 24 week study in children 2-5y; and study 014, an uncontrolled bioavailability study in healthy 
adults) together with a Population PK analysis the objective of which was to compare observed, and predict 
population, data for LUM and IVA exposures in 2-5 year old patients compared with patients 12 years and older. 
In study 115 , LUM/IVA were given to 2-5 year old CF patients homozygous for F508del-CFTR, the genotypic 
subgroup for which Orkambi is currently authorised, administered with the LUM/IVA FDC at the proposed 
posology for this age group. PK studies were conducted in the fed state, due to the increase in bioavailability of 
Orkambi with food, as recommended in the SmPC.  
For Study 115 part A, the PK concentrations of LUM and M28-LUM were similar between day 1 and day 15. IVA 
and M1-IVA C3-4h concentrations were reduced between day 1 and day 15 whereas M6-IVA concentrations 
were increased. The trough concentrations of IVA, M1-IVA and M6-IVA were variable between day 8 and day 15. 
For Study 115 part B, the LUM PK trough concentrations and at C2-6h were all comparable between the CF 
subjects < 14 kg and ≥ 14 kg. However, mean IVA concentrations appeared to be 30% lower at W24 compared 
to day 15. It was also noted that the CV% of IVA and its metabolite concentrations was high (approaching 100% 
at several time points). Therefore, the MAH was asked to discuss the high interindividual variability in IVA 
concentrations and its impact on efficacy/safety. In their response, the MAH justified the high variability in IVA 
and IVA metabolites concentration by similarity in the variability between Study 115 and the other Phase 3 
studies in other age groups. Therefore, it is agreed that the variability is unlikely to impact clinical efficacy or 
safety in study 115 population. 
The PK parameters of the granule formulation were similar to the tablet formulation. The Cmax of the both 
components are lower for the granules than the tablets, the AUC for IVA is similar for both the tablet and granule 
formulations, for Lumacaftor it is somewhat lower for the granules. No information on PK-PD relationships have 
been provided in this submission. .  The MAH was asked to justify why the lower Cmax and AUC (for LUM) will 
not influence the efficacy. The MAH indicated that LUM/IVA exposure range in Studies 011, 109, and 115 is not 
sufficient for a conclusive PK/PD analysis. Additionally, sweat chloride measure showed no exposure response 
trend confirming the lack of an exposure response profile for sweat chloride. The applicant’s justification was 
accepted.     
Food significantly increases the bioavailability of LUM/IVA from the granules. It is indicated in Sec 4.2 of the 
proposed SmPC that the granules be administered in the fed state and this is agreed. 
LUM and IVA exposures (AUC0-∞ and Cmax) were dose proportional between LUM 100-mg/IVA 125-mg and 
LUM 150-mg/IVA 188-mg doses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/843650/2018 
Page 20/65 
  
  
The MAH used a population PK approach to characterise the exposure for LUM and IVA in the CF subjects within 
2-5 years of age. The MAH pooled the results of 3 studies (study 115, study 109 and study 011) while fitting the 
data to the previously described 2-compartmental models for LUM and IVA accounting for the reduction in IVA 
Cl due to CYP3A induction by LUM. Cl was estimated to be 1.7 L/hr for LUM and 17.36 for IVA (without 
induction). The MAH used the model to predict the AUC0-12h exposures which appeared comparable for LUM 
between the 2-5 and other age groups (6-11, 12-17 and ≥18). However, IVA exposure appeared 1.4 to 1.7 fold 
higher in the 2-5 age group compared to the ≥18 age group. The MAH confirmed that the increase in the median 
of IVA AUCs in the target paediatric population is not expected to change the clinical outcomes as small 
variations in AUC do not appear to have a significant influence on observed sweat chloride. Additionally, the 
median IVA AUCs in the 2 to <5 years paediatric population were generally comparable to 6 to <11 years 
population and 2- to 4-fold lower than that observed in 2 to <12 years subjects for IVA monotherapy, which 
showed to be safe in this paediatric population. This is considered adequate.   
The current recommendations for impaired renal function are adequate for the new formulation in the 2-5 year 
old age group.  
Moderate and severe hepatic impairment is rare in children 2 – 5 years of age with CF but does occur. The same 
recommendations are therefore made for the two age groups: a 25% reduction in total daily dose in moderate 
hepatic impairment and to be used with caution in severe hepatic impairment, to a maximum total daily dose 
50% of that normally recommended. The table with recommendations for dose modifications in hepatic 
impairment in section 4.2 of the SmPC has been suitably amended. The MAH has provided simulations in the age 
group 2-5 for the effect of dose adjustment in on LUM and IVA exposures in moderate hepatic impairment. The 
simulation showed that a reduction of the dose to q24h maintained the exposure for LUM and IVA within the 
90% CI of adult exposures, although LUM lower quartile in 2-5 CF subjects <14 kg was below the lower limit of 
the adult 90% CI. The MAH was asked to discuss LUM lower exposure in those subjects. The MAH acknowledged 
the low LUM exposure in CF subjects who are 2 to 5 years of age and who weigh <14 kg and conducted additional 
dose simulations to propose a new regimen to better match the LUM exposures in adults. The new simulation 
results showed that 25% dose reduction achieved LUM/IVA exposures which best matches to the efficacious 
exposures of LUM/IVA in adults. The MAH hence proposed an amended dose recommendation for this subgroup 
and this has been adequately reflected in the SmPC changes, section 4.2. This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Literature data indicate that females with CF tend to fare worse than males in terms of clinical course of disease 
and females die on average 2- 3 years earlier than males with CF. LUM/IVA exposure was similar in boys and 
girls. No Patients with CF over the age of 5 were included in the studies accompanying this submission. 
As CYP3A maturation is complete before 2 years of age, recommendations for LUM/IVA dose adjustments for 
patients 2-5 years of age in the setting of CYP3A inhibition are based on those for patients 12 years and older. 
The SmPC recommendations as proposed for the CF subjects 2-5 years are acceptable. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Relevant to the current line extension application, study 115 evaluated a range of PD endpoints in CF patients 
2-5 years of age administered with Orkambi granules formulation. In particular, study 115 part B evaluated 
change from baseline sweat chloride, accepted as a pharmacodynamic readout of CFTR function, in response to 
LUM/IVA treatment. There was an improvement (reduction) in sweat chloride by Week 24.  The mean absolute 
change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week 24 was -31.7 mmol/L (P<0.0001). The magnitude of the change 
from baseline in sweat chloride, with reversal on treatment discontinuation supports a relevant 
pharmacodynamic effect, consistent with at least partial correction of the core biochemical defect and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/843650/2018 
Page 21/65 
  
  
proposed mechanism of action for the fixed drug combination, in the 2-5 years age group at the proposed 
posology. However, the  effect of treatment on biomarkers such as sweat chloride that directly measure CFTR 
function, can be considered only as intermediate proof of efficacy (the report from the Workshop on Endpoints 
in Cystic Fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012). The same report also indicates that the effect of the CFTR 
modifiers on the sweat gland may not necessarily reflects the effect on other organs. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In Study 115, BMI, weight and stature increased from baseline over 24 weeks in the 2-5y old subjects. While this 
could be consistent with improved pancreatic function and therefore improved nutritional status, the effect on 
treatment on these parameters is also confounded by growth that would occur between the ages 2-5y. This will 
be followed in post-authorisation phase. 
Limited spirometry endpoints were evaluated in this study and no notable changes observed. The guideline on 
clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008-corr* (22 October 2009) recommends FEV1 as an efficacy endpoint. However, 
the Report from the Workshop on Endpoints in Cystic Fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012) acknowledges 
that in younger patients with milder disease, and in whom respiratory function as determined by spirometry may 
not have begun to decline, FEV1 may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a treatment effect.  Given that lung 
function may not have deteriorated and FEV1 is difficult to measure in children in this age group, the limited 
results are not interpretable. The report from the workshop also recommends that in younger patients, a more 
sensitive endpoint such as LCI should be evaluated, although the limited clinical experience of this as an 
outcome measure, and the lack of an established clinically relevant magnitude of benefit are also acknowledged. 
There was a non-significant decline (reflecting improvement) in LCI2.5 from baseline through to 24 weeks 
(mean change from baseline -0.58 (P = 0.0559) and a statistically significant benefit in the >14kg group. The 
clinical relevance is however not established.  
IRT is a sensitive marker of pancreatic insufficiency. There was a statistically significant decline in IRT levels 
through week 24 with a variable but non-significant increase after the 2 weeks wash out. This is usually used a 
test for neonatal screening, the significance and implication of the findings on clinically relevant outcomes needs 
to be discussed.  
FE-1 was low at baseline in most patients indicating exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. There was a statistically 
significant improvement in FE1 levels at week 24 with a variable but non-significant decline after the 2 weeks 
wash out. Again, while this test is used to measure exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, the significance and 
implication of the findings on clinically relevant outcomes remains unclear. 
The results taken together imply that the directionality of the PD endpoints does suggest a positive PD effect for 
most end points. Overall, the exploratory PD data from study 115 part B provide support that Orkambi at the 
proposed posology acts in a manner consistent with the primary pharmacology. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of Orkambi in the new formulation in the age range proposed in the line extension is 
supported by the PD endpoints in Study 115.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Study 115 was a Phase 3, 2-part, open-label study in CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age, homozygous for 
F508del. Part A was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of LUM/IVA administered for 15 
days. A review of safety, tolerability, and available PK data was completed after Part A completion, to determine 
the dose(s) to be evaluated in Part B.  
Part B was designed to evaluate the safety of LUM/IVA administered for 24 weeks. 
Moreover, the following PD parameters related to efficacy were assessed in Study 115 Part B: (1) sweat chloride, 
(2) body mass index (BMI) and BMI z-score, (3) weight and weight z-score, (4) stature and statue z-score, (5) 
pulmonary exacerbations (PExs) and hospitalizations, (6) fecal elastase-1 (FE-1) levels, (7) immunoreactive 
trypsinogen (IRT), (8) microbiology cultures, (9) spirometry, and (10) lung clearance index (LCI; optional 
substudy).

Study Participants  
Male and female subjects 2 through 5 years of age with CF, homozygous for F508del: 
1. Subject’s legally appointed and authorized representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) signed and dated an 
ICF, and the subject signed and dated an assent form (if applicable). 
2. Subject’s legally appointed and authorized representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) was willing and able 
to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, study restrictions, laboratory tests, and other study 
procedures. 
3. Subjects (males and females) were between 2 and 5 years of age, inclusive, on the date of informed consent 
(and assent, if applicable) for the relevant study part. 
4. Subjects who weighed ≥8 kg without shoes and wearing light clothing at the Screening Visit. 
5. Subjects with confirmed diagnosis of CFat the Screening Visit. CF was defined as follows: 
2 CF-causing mutations (all as documented in the subject’s medical record) AND chronic sinopulmonary disease 
OR gastrointestinal/nutritional abnormalities; 
6. Subjects who were homozygous for F508del (genotype confirmed at the Screening Visit). If the CFTR 
screening genotype result was not received before Day -1, a previous CFTR genotype laboratory report could be 
used to establish eligibility.  
7. Subjects with stable CF disease as deemed by the investigator at the Screening Visit. 
8. Subjects who were willing to remain on a stable CF medication regimen through Day 15 (Part A) or through 
the Safety Follow-up Visit (Part B), if applicable.

Treatments 
Test treatment:  
Dose rationale: The doses chosen for Study 115 were based on simulations conducted using a previously 
developed population PK model with data from CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age. The plasma concentration 
versus time data from Part A was intended to inform the appropriateness or necessary adjustment of planned 
doses for Part B. A population PK model with allometric scaling of clearance and volume of distribution as a 
function of weight was used to project exposures of LUM and IVA for comparison with clinical experiences with 
both drugs and to select doses to be evaluated in the study population. The IVA model was coupled to the LUM 
model to account for the induction of CYP3A by LUM, which increases the metabolism of IVA. The population PK 
model was based on data obtained from subjects 6 years of age and older across the LUM and IVA combination 
development program. No safety issues were identified in prior clinical or nonclinical studies that would preclude 
the dosing regimen proposed for the current protocol. 
Rationale for LUM Dose 
LUM exposure projections for subjects 2 through 5 years of age were based on available data from Studies 103, 
104, and 011. In the LUM/IVA combination program, the dose regimen of LUM 400 mg/IVA 250 mg every 12 
hours (q12h) was used in the Phase 3 studies (Study 103 and Study 104) for subjects 12 years of age and older. 
In the Phase 3 Study 011, the dose regimen of LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg q12h was used for subjects 6 through 
11 years of age. For subjects 2 through 5 years of age who weigh <14 kg, oral administration of LUM 100 mg 
was projected to yield a mean AUCss of 201 μg·h/mL. For subjects 2 through 5 years of age who weigh ≥14 kg, 
oral administration of LUM 150 mg was projected to yield a mean AUCss of 238 μg·h/mL. Based on these 
simulations, the LUM doses selected for Part A were expected to 
yield exposures that were comparable to those of subjects 6 years of age and older (i.e.,203 μg·h/mL), which 
were shown to be safe and well tolerated in combination with IVA. 
Rationale for IVA Dose 
IVA as a single agent was previously investigated and approved for use in paediatric patients with CF 2 to less 
than 6 years of age with select mutations; the weight-based IVA exposures were from the Phase 3 study (Study 
770-108).  
In the LUM/IVA combination program, due to the induction effect of LUM on the metabolism of IVA, the IVA 
exposures are lower than that of the IVA monotherapy. 
For subjects 2 through 5 years of age who weigh <14 kg, oral administration of IVA 125 mg in combination with 
LUM was projected to yield a mean AUCss of 5.49 μg·h/mL. For subjects 2 through 5 years of age who weigh ≥14 
kg, oral administration of IVA 188 mg in combination with LUM was projected to yield a mean AUCss of 5.71 
μg·h/mL. Based on these simulations, the IVA doses selected for Part A were expected to yield IVA exposures 
that were comparable to subjects 6 years of age and older and within prior clinical experience with IVA alone 
(10.5 μg·h/mL for subjects <14 kg and 11.3 μg·h/mL for subjects ≥14 kg). 
Dose used:  
Subjects weighing <14 kg at screening 
LUM 100 mg/IVA 125 mg every 12 hours (q12h) (1 capsule [Part A;q12h] or 1 stick pack [Part B;q12h) was

Results 
Participant flow 
Subjects in Part B were enrolled at 20 sites in North America. Subject disposition is summarized in table below. 
Sixty subjects were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of LUM/IVA; 56 (93.3%) subjects completed LUM/IVA 
treatment, and 57 (95.0%) subjects completed the study. Three subjects in the L150/I188q12h group 
prematurely discontinued from both LUM/IVA treatment and the study because of AEs of LFT elevations. One 
subject in the L100/I125q12h group prematurely discontinued LUM/IVA treatment 1 month early due to a 
miscommunication (classified as “other” reason); this subject completed the study. All 57 subjects who 
completed the study, including the subject who prematurely discontinued study treatment, rolled over into a 
2-year extension study (Study 116). Thirty-seven subjects (5 in the L100/I125q12h group and 32 in the 
L150/I188q12h group) participated in the LCI Substudy.

Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
Amendment 1: Version 1.0 of the protocol, dated 03 March 2016, was amended to Version 2.0, dated 01 August 
2016, to add a Washout Period to evaluate the off-drug PD response in Part B. In addition, the inclusion criterion 
of ppFEV1 ≥40 was removed from Parts A and B to avoid excluding subjects who were otherwise eligible but 
unable to perform spirometry given their age. Additional important changes in Part B included making the LCI 
assessment optional and adding serial post-dose vital sign assessments on Day 1 for respiratory AE monitoring.  
Amendment 2: Version 2.0 of the protocol, dated 01 August 2016, was amended to Version 3.0, dated 13 April 
2017, to include prescription of a SAB for subjects in Part B (if not already prescribed). The prescription ensured 
constant availability of bronchodilator therapy based on a request from the PDCO as part of the PIP for this 
product.

Outcomes and estimation 
Sweat chloride concentration: There was a statistically significant improvement (i.e., a reduction) in sweat 
chloride concentration in the overall population after LUM/IVA treatment, with a mean absolute change from 
baseline at Week 24 of -31.7 mmol/L (P<0.0001), see figure below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/843650/2018 
Page 32/65 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The improvement in sweat chloride concentration was reversed after a 2-week Washout Period without LUM/IVA 
treatment. The mean absolute change in sweat chloride concentration from Week 24 at Week 26 was 33.0 
mmol/L (P<0.0001) in the overall population. 
The change from baseline in sweat chloride, with reversal on treatment discontinuation supports a relevant  
pharmacodynamic effect, consistent with at least partial correction of the core biochemical defect and the 
proposed mechanism of action for the fixed drug combination, in the 2 – 5 years age group at the proposed 
posology. However, the  effect of treatment on biomarkers such as sweat chloride that directly measure CFTR 
function, can be considered as intermediate proof of efficacy (the report from the Workshop on Endpoints in 
Cystic Fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012). The same report also indicates that the effect of the CFTR 
modifiers on the sweat gland may not necessarily reflects the effect on other organs.  
BMI, weight and stature: After treatment with LUM/IVA, the overall population showed a statistically 
significant improvement in parameters related to BMI, weight, and stature at Week 24: 
BMI: mean absolute change from baseline of 0.27 kg/m2 (P = 0.0091)

BMI-for-age z-score: mean absolute change from baseline of 0.29 (P = 0.0003) 
Weight: mean absolute change from baseline of 1.4 kg (P<0.0001) 
o Weight-for-age z-score: mean absolute change from baseline of 0.26 (P<0.0001)

Stature: mean absolute change from baseline of 3.6 cm (P<0.0001). 
Stature-for-age z-score: mean absolute change from baseline of 0.09 (P = 0.0104). 
Through Week 24, 18 (30.0%) subjects had PEx events. The normalized number of PExs (event rate per patient 
year) was 0.90 for PExs and 0.20 for CF-related hospitalizations.  The time to first PEx was based on a 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, subjects had an event-free probability (95% CI) of 0.695 (0.561, 0.796) at Week 24  
After treatment with LUM/IVA, the overall population showed a statistically significant improvement in FE-1at 
week 24 and IRT through Week 24, suggesting the potential of LUM/IVA to improve pancreatic function 
o FE-1: mean absolute change from baseline of 52.6 μg/g (P = 0.0012). FE-1 levels <15 μg/g were observed in 
43 (89.6%) subjects with data at baseline. At the Follow-up Visit, after the 2-week Washout Period, the 
improvement in FE-1 decreased both overall and for several individual subjects, with a mean absolute change 
from baseline of 13.5 μg/g (P = 0.1781).

No notable changes from baseline were observed in microbiology cultures at Week 24. For all bacterial species 
tested, the majority of subjects had a negative culture result at both time points.  
No notable changes from baseline were observed in ppFEV1 at Week 24. Limited data were available due to the 
difficulty of obtaining spirometry measurements in young children (12 subjects had both a baseline and a Week 
24 measurement available). 
The guideline on clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008-corr* (22 October 2009) recommends FEV1 as an efficacy endpoint. However, 
the Report from the Workshop on Endpoints in Cystic Fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012) acknowledges 
that in younger patients with milder disease, and in whom respiratory function as determined by spirometry may 
not have begun to decline, FEV1 may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a treatment effect.  Given that lung 
function may not have deteriorated and FEV1 is difficult to measure in children in this age group, the results are 
not interpretable.  
In acceptability and palatability assessments, when consuming food containing LUM/IVA mixture, 17.9% of 
subjects “liked it very much” and 12.5% “liked it a little.” Overall, 58 (96.7%) subjects were ≥80% compliant 
with LUM/IVA dosing in Part B. 
In the LCI Sub study, the overall population had a mean change from baseline in LCI2.5 at Week 24 of -0.58 (P 
= 0.0559). The LCI5.0 showed no meaningful change from baseline during the treatment period. In the higher 
weight group (older subjects), the change from baseline in LCI2.5 was -0.76 (P = 0.0322). The LCI5.0 fluctuated 
over time and showed no meaningful change from baseline during the treatment period. The mean (SD) 
absolute change from baseline in LCI5.0 was -0.06 (0.66) in the overall population at Week 24 (P = 0.7235).

pathophysiology of CF and feedback from regulatory authorities, efficacy in this age group was extrapolated 
from data from the placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study in CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age (Study 109) and 
placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies in CF subjects 12 years of age and older (Studies 103 and 104). PD 
outcomes supporting efficacy in this age range were observed.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application for the extension of the indication of Orkambi to children aged 2 to 5 years is based on a single 
study  115,  a  Phase  3,  two-part,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  safety,  pharmacokinetics  and 
pharmacodynamics of Orkambi in the patient population target of the present variation procedure. Efficacy was 
extrapolated from trials in older age groups. 
Children  recruited  in  Study  115,  although  by  an  indirect  comparison  with  European  CF  registries,  can  be 
considered as a cohort sufficiently representative of European young children with CF. It is of note that: i) the 
mean BMI was 15.98 kg/m2 which corresponds approximately to 25% of healthy subjects in this range (10.25th 
percentile) if CDC reference growth charts were used to evaluate growth rate in enrolled patients, and the mean 
BMI z-score was 0.17 which corresponds to ~ 50th
 percentile; ii) the mean baseline sweat chloride concentration 
was 105.8 mmol/L, well above the threshold of 60 mmol/L considered for inclusion in the trial; iii) all subjects 
tested at baseline had FE-1 levels <200 μg/g and therefore were pancreatic insufficient; iv)  children in this age 
range typically have difficulty performing spirometry assessments,  only 1 subject in the L100/I125q12h group 
and 16 subjects in the L150/I188q12h group were able to complete spirometry testing at baseline; overall, the 
mean percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) in these subjects was 83.8, indicating 
normal lung function; v) In a subset of CF collaborative patients ≥3 years of age at screening, LCI was used as 
a surrogate exploratory endpoint to measure lung ventilation inhomogeneity. However, only very few patients 
(4 in the lower dose group and 20 in the higher dose group) had LCI values measured at baseline and moreover 
the  baseline  mean,  median  and  range  of  all  LCI  values  were  all  in  the  physiological  value  for  age;  vi) 
microbiologcial  clinical  data  at  baseline  of  enrolled  2-5  years  old  CF  patients  largely  overlapped  with  those 
reported in available CF registries. Due to the limited follow up and limited number of expected infective events 
in  the  2-5  years  patient  population,  thanks  to  the  availability  of  newborn  screening  programs,  it  was  not 
expected to detect any meaningful change between baseline and week 24 treatment.  
The  most  common  medical  history  conditions  were  pancreatic  failure  (83.3%),  GERD  (43.3%)  and  CF  lung 
(38.3%).  Administered  background  symptomatic  treatments,  reflected  those  commonly  prescribed  in  EU 
patients  with  clinical  manifestations  of  CF,  with  the  exception  of  dornase  alfa  (71.7%),  the  most  common 
administered medication after Salbutamol (78.3%). Several randomised and observational epidemiological data 
(Konstan  MW  et  al.  J  Cyst  Fibros  2012;  11:78-83.  Yang  C  et  al  2016;  Cochrane  Database  Syst  Rev.  2016; 
4:CD001127) suggest that dornase alfa, a recombinant deoxyribonuclease that improves mucus clearance in 
the lung,  has the potential to alter the course of CF by decreasing the rate of lung function decline and the risk 
of exacerbations when administered early in children.  Thus, the concomitant therapy with dornase alfa may 
have  impacted  on  several  secondary  PD  endpoints.  In  the  absence  of  a  control  group,  it  is  thus  difficult  to 
disentangle  the  effect  of  LUM/IVA  from  that  of  dornase  alfa  on  pulmonary  exacerbations  and  number  of 
hospitalizations, as well as on absolute change of ppFEV1, also considering the lack of clinical knowledge on the 
effect of dornase alfa in early treatment of paediatric EU patients with CF.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 115 part B evaluated change from baseline sweat chloride, accepted as a pharmacodynamic readout of 
CFTR function, in response to LUM/IVA treatment. There was an improvement (reduction) in sweat chloride by 
Week 24.  The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week 24 was -31.7 mmol/L (P<0.0001). 
The magnitude of the change from baseline in sweat chloride, with reversal on treatment discontinuation 
Assessment report

supports a relevant pharmacodynamic effect, consistent with at least partial correction of the core biochemical 
defect and the proposed mechanism of action for the fixed drug combination, in the 2-5 years age group at the 
proposed posology. However, the  effect of treatment on biomarkers such as sweat chloride that directly 
measure CFTR function, could be considered as intermediate proof of efficacy for very young children (see report 
from the Workshop on Endpoints in Cystic Fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012). The same report also 
indicates that the effect of the CFTR modifiers on the sweat gland may not necessarily reflects the effect on other 
organs. 
In Study 115, BMI, weight and stature increased from baseline over 24 weeks in the 2-5 years old subjects. 
While this could be consistent with improved pancreatic function and therefore improved nutritional status, the 
effect on treatment on these parameters is also confounded by growth that would occur between the ages 2-5 
years. The company was requested to provide a comparison with an age matched untreated CF cohort to 
support interpretation of the results. The MAH presented the requested analyses, however questions remain on 
the treatment effects of Orkambi on growth parameters given the confounding from natural growth and the 
absence of a comparator.  
Limited spirometry endpoints were evaluated in this study and no notable changes observed. The guideline on 
clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008-corr* (22 October 2009) recommends FEV1 as an efficacy endpoint. However, 
the Report from the Workshop on Endpoints in Cystic Fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012) acknowledges 
that in younger patients with milder disease, and in whom respiratory function as determined by spirometry may 
not have begun to decline, FEV1 may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a treatment effect.  Given that lung 
function may not have deteriorated and FEV1 is difficult to measure in children in this age group, further 
post-marketing data will be needed. The MAH will initiate a post-authorisation efficacy study. 
The report from the workshop recommends that in younger patients, a more sensitive endpoint such as LCI 
should be evaluated, although the limited clinical experience of this as an outcome measure, and the lack of an 
established clinically relevant magnitude of benefit, are also acknowledged. There was a non-significant decline 
(reflecting improvement) in LCI2.5 from baseline through to 24 weeks (mean change from baseline -0.58 (P = 
0.0559) and a statistically significant benefit in the >14kg group. Data provided on this surrogate give sufficient 
assurance on efficacy, however, considering the invalidated status of this surrogate confirmation on clinical 
parameters needs to be given post authorisation. Given that there was no meaningful change in LCI5.0, (a 
change in LCI 2.5 in those >14kg only) and that changes in FEV1 have not been measured, the agreed 
post-authorisation efficacy study will need to be evaluated once results are available. 
The  Pex  rate  per  patient  year  and  related  hospitalisations  is  noted.  However,  this  is  difficult  to  interpret 
meaningfully in a within-group analysis. The MAH was required to discuss this and present a comparison with an 
appropriately selected age matched untreated CF cohort. The MAH stated that although the data on PEx are 
available via CF registries, significant differences in the event definitions between the CF registry and this clinical 
study  would  preclude  meaningful  and  appropriate  comparisons  of  the  estimates  from  these  2  sources,  and 
therefore does not believe a matched cohort from registries would provide additional information. Given the 
absence of a consensus definition for PEx in clinical trials in this population, the following definition was used in 
trial 115 for the analysis of PExs: New or changed treatment with oral, inhaled, or IV antibiotics AND fulfillment 
of 1 criterion from List A of sinopulmonary signs or 2 criteria from List B of sinopulmonary symptoms, within the 
period 3 days before antibiotic start date through antibiotic stop date. 3/19 patients (15.8%) in the LUM 100 
mg/ IVA 125 mg q12h group had 5 events of pulmonary exacerbations  through week 24 (event rate per patient 
year 0.54), while in the LUM 150 mg/ IVA 188 mg q12h group 15/41 (36.6%) had 20 pulmonary exacerbations 
(event rate per patient year 1.07). Of these, one patient in the LUM 100 mg/ IVA 125 mg q12h group and 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/843650/2018

patients in the LUM 150 mg/ IVA 188 mg q12h group required hospitalization. In the absence of a control group, 
it is difficult to evaluate whether this is the expected number of events in this patient population. Furthermore, 
the interpretation of data of time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation is hampered by the small number of patients. 
In general, very few events are expected in this young population of CF patients.  
IRT is a sensitive marker of pancreatic insufficiency. Trypsinogen is a protein produced by the pancreas that can 
be detected in the blood via the immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) assay and is used in clinical practice as a 
neonatal screening test for CF, wherein elevated levels are associated with pancreatic inflammation.  Changes 
from baseline have been observed in immunoreactive trypsinogen through Week 24 (the overall mean (SD) 
absolute  change  from  baseline  was  -130.2  ng/mL  P  <  0.0001).  It  is  accepted  that  low  IRT  concentrations 
correlate  with  clinical  and  biochemical  evidence  of  malabsorption,  and  might  be  considered  a  marker  of 
pancreatic function. However, no compelling evidence from the literature is available to support IRT as specific 
indicator of pancreatic function and thus available data do not allow to adequately evaluate the clinical relevance 
of the observed change in immunoreactive trypsinogen from baseline.  
Absolute change from baseline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) 
Assessment of changes in ppFEV1, the recommended primary endpoint to be used for registration studies as 
outlined in the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008), is not feasible in children from birth through 5 years of age because 
FEV1  involves  spirometry,  which  can  only  be  performed  in  children  6  years  of  age  and  older.  In  addition, 
spirometry  parameters  are  not  sufficiently  sensitive  to  detect  early  manifestations  of  lung  disease  in  young 
children with CF or for assessing drug effects. Given to low disease progression, longer longitudinal observations 
in younger patients are needed to guide interpretation of test results.  
Lung Clearance Index (LCI) 
Treatment with LUM/IVA resulted in a statistical improvement (i.e., a reduction) in LCI2.5, with a mean (SD) 
absolute change from baseline of -0.58 (1.16) in the overall population at Week 24 (P = 0.0559).  
The LCI5.0 fluctuated over time and showed no meaningful change from baseline during the treatment period, 
the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in LCI5.0 was -0.06 (0.66) in the overall population at Week 24 
(P = 0.7235).  
Due  to  both  technical  limitations  in  the  assay  performance  in  patients  under  six  years  of  age,  as  well  as  to 
incomplete knowledge of the range of LCI in CF people of very young age and age matched healthy control 
subjects, it is not possible to disentangle treatment effect from variability due to asymptomatic disease. Longer 
longitudinal observations in young patients in whom lung disease progression is very low may help to guide test 
result interpretation.  
During the procedure,  the MAH provided the requested efficacy data from the ongoing Studies 116 (enrolling 
2-5 years old patients from study 115) and 110 (long term open label study enrolling 6-11 years old subjects 
coming from studies 109 and 011B). 
Efficacy data for Study 116: an interim efficacy analysis was performed by the MAH to provide this response. 
With regard to change in ppFEV1, no conclusion can be drawn as the numbers in are small. The levels  in sweat 
chloride at week 48 is  similar to that observed at week 24, though a small numerically declining trend is noted. 
A similar trend is observed for growth parameter (BMI, weight for age, and height for age) Z scores.  
The present interim analysis data does not allow a clear conclusion, but is considered sufficient at the time. 
While sweat chloride and levels growth parameters Z scores, are somewhat similar at week 48 to those at week 
Assessment report

24, a small numerical decline is noted. Further data over time are required from this study and the PAES (with 
an untreated control group) to confirm changes in these parameters and clinical benefit for this patient group 
over time, is required. 
Efficacy data for Study 110: The MAH has provided the results with the appropriate baseline (i.e. end of the 
parent study). Overall, the results for Study 110 is similar. Results at week 48 on treatment are similar to those 
seen at week 24, with a numerical decline noted. As above, additional data are awaited after study closure in 
2019 before firm conclusions can be drawn.  
The results so far from both these efficacy studies seem to indicate an overall maintenance of measured 
parameters, albeit with a somewhat numerically declining trend. Additional data are awaited after closure of 
both studies in 2019 before further conclusions can be drawn. 
Exploratory PD data from study 115 part B provide support that the new FDC of Orkambi at the proposed 
posology acts in a manner consistent with the primary pharmacology and the benefit-risk of the combination is 
positive in the given age group. Further data will be collected in post-authorisation phase. Therefore, the CHMP 
requested that the MAH conducts a PAES for patients 2- to 5-years-old at initiation of Orkambi to provide the 
additional data. In addition to the proposed PAES study described here, data from the ongoing safety Studies 
809-108 (PASS) and 809-116 will be provided. 
The research question that the PAES study should allow to confirm whether children with CF homozygous for 
f508del-CFTR (F/F) and who are treated with Orkambi early in life will have less advanced disease when they 
become older compared to those who were never treated with Orkambi (or other CFTR modulator) or who 
initiated treatment with Orkambi at a later age. 
The objectives of the PAES study should be:  
• 
• 
• 
to evaluate disease progression in children with CF homozygous for f508del-CFTR (F/F) and who initiate 
Orkambi treatment between the ages of 2 through 5 years in comparison to a concurrent matched 
cohort of children with CF who have never received Orkambi (or other CFTR modulator) treatment. 
Thus, a matched concurrent untreated cohort of 2-5 year CF patients homozygous for F508del-CFTR 
(F/F) – in addition to the longitudinal historical cohort - should be foreseen in the study protocol;  
to describe disease progression in children with CF homozygous for f508del-CFTR (F/F)  and who initiate 
Orkambi treatment between the ages of 2 through 5 years compared with children from Study 110 who 
initiated Orkambi treatment between the ages of 6 through 11 years. This in addition to the comparison 
with an historical cohort as proposed by the MAH. 
to evaluate the safety outcomes among children with CF homozygous for f508del-CFTR (F/F) and who 
initiate Orkambi treatment between the ages of 2 through 5 years. In order to allow evaluating long 
term effectiveness and safety of Orkambi in young children the study should follow patients for up to 6 
years after the end of the enrolment period. The primary outcomes of interest in this study should be 
measures of nutritional status and pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) leading to hospitalization. 
The CHMP strongly recommended that the protocol for this PAES is developed in discussion with the CHMP 
SAWP, to which the MAH agreed.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
An extrapolation exercise of efficacy based on efficacy data from older age groups was conducted. PK studies 
have been done in the proposed age group and these do not rise any concerns. While the extrapolation is in 
principle acceptable, there are some uncertainties given the size of the effect for Orkambi in adults.  
During the evaluation, the MAH submitted also the requested efficacy data from Studies 116 and 110. The 
results so far from both these efficacy studies seem to indicate an overall maintenance or measured parameters, 
albeit with a somewhat numerically declining trended. Additional data are awaited after closure of both studies 
in 2019 before further conclusions can be drawn. 
Therefore a PAES study needs to be undertaken to confirm the extrapolation. The MAH commits to conducting 
such PAES for patients 2- to 5-years-old at initiation of Orkambi to provide the additional data that CHMP is 
requesting in this patient population. The study protocol is strongly recommended to be designed based on a 
CHMP scientific advice. The MAH agreed to that. In addition to the proposed PAES study described here, data 
from the ongoing safety Studies 809-108 (PASS) and 809-116 will be provided. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Post-Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES) 
Based on an agreed protocol, the Applicant should conduct a long-term 
effectiveness study to compare disease progression among children with CF 
homozygous for F508del-CFTR and are aged 2 through 5 years at the time of 
Orkambi treatment initiation versus disease progression among concurrent 
matched cohort of children with CF who have never received Orkambi 
treatment, in addition to a longitudinal historical cohort.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Part A 
The  majority  of  subjects  had  AEs  that  were  considered  mild  (9  subjects  [75.0%])  in  severity.  One  (8.3%) 
subject had an AE of respiratory rate increased that was of moderate severity; this AE also led to LUM/IVA 
discontinuation. No subjects had severe or life-threatening (i.e., Grade 3 or 4) AEs. 
Part B 
The majority of subjects had AEs that were considered mild (29 subjects [48.3%]) or moderate (25 subjects 
[41.7%]) in severity. A total of 5 (8.3%) subjects had severe AEs. The majority of severe events resolved and 
were considered possibly related to LUM/IVA. One (1.7%) subject each had severe events of gastroenteritis viral 
and  constipation,  both  of  which  were  SAEs.  One  (1.7%)  subject  had  severe  events  of  ALT,  AST,  and  GGT 
increased that led to LUM/IVA discontinuation. An additional 1 (1.7%) subject each had severe events of ALT 
increased and infective PEx of CF, the latter of which was an SAE. No life-threatening (Grade 4) AEs occurred. 
There were no deaths in study 115. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
Assessment report  
EMA/843650/2018 
Page 45/65 
  
  
 
AESIs were not evaluated in Part A. 
Part B 
AESIs were defined as AEs related to elevated transaminases, respiratory symptoms, and respiratory events. 
The AESI category of respiratory events comprises PTs for respiratory symptoms and reactive airway. 
AESI of Elevated Transaminases: A total of 8 (13.3%) subjects had AESIs of elevated transaminases. By PT, ALT 
increased occurred in 8 (13.3%) subjects and AST increased occurred in 6 (10.0%) subjects. The majority of 
AESIs of elevated transaminases were mild (5 of 8 subjects) or moderate (1 of 8 subjects) in severity. Two 
subjects  had  AESIs  of  elevated  transaminases  that  were  severe.  No  life-threatening  AESIs  of  elevated 
transaminases  occurred.  Two  (3.3%)  subjects  had  AESIs  of  elevated  transaminases  that  led  to  LUM/IVA 
interruption.  Three  (5.0%)  subjects  discontinued  treatment  due  to  an  AESI  of  elevated  transaminases.  No 
serious  AESIs  of  elevated  transaminases  occurred,  and  all  transaminase  elevations  returned  to  baseline  at 
subsequent visits. Among the 8 subjects with AESIs of elevated transaminases, the median time-to-onset of the 
first AESI was 29.0 days overall, and the mean (SD) duration of events was 39.2 (40.6) days. 
AESI of Respiratory Symptoms: A total of 3 (5.0%) subjects had AESIs of respiratory symptoms. By PT, dyspnea 
occurred in 3 (5.0%) subjects and respiration abnormal occurred in 1 (1.7%) subject. All AESIs of respiratory 
symptoms  were  mild  (2  of  3  subjects)  or  moderate  (1  of  3  subjects)  in  severity.  No  subjects  had  AESIs  of 
respiratory symptoms that led to interruption or discontinuation of treatment. No subject had a serious AESI of 
respiratory symptoms. Among the 3 subjects with AESIs of respiratory events, the median time-to-onset of the 
first AESI was 2.0 days, and the mean (SD) duration of events was 2.3 (1.9) days. 
AESI of Respiratory Events:  A total of 6 (10.0%) subjects had AESIs of respiratory events. In addition to the 
subjects with respiratory symptoms described in Section 12.2.4.4 (dyspnoea and respiration abnormal), other 
respiratory events of wheezing occurred in 3 (5.0%) subjects. All AESIs of respiratory events were mild (3 of 6 
subjects) or moderate (3 of 6 subjects) in severity. No subjects had AESIs of respiratory events that led to 
interruption or discontinuation of treatment. No subject had a serious AESI of respiratory events. Among the 6 
subjects with AESIs of respiratory events, the median time-to-onset of the first AESI was 9 days, and the mean 
(SD) duration of events was 6.1 (7.2) days. 
Laboratory findings 
Mandatory Liver Function Testing 
It was strongly recommended that subjects with new treatment-emergent ALT or AST elevations of ≥3 × ULN 
and clinical symptoms be followed closely, including repeated confirmatory testing performed by the central 
laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT and AST levels, as 
clinically indicated. LUM/IVA administration was interrupted immediately if any of the following criteria were 
met: ALT or AST ≥8 × ULN, ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks, ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN in association with 
total  bilirubin  ≥2  ×  ULN  and/or  clinical  jaundice.  Resumption  of  Study  Drug  was  allowed  if  a  convincing 
alternative aetiology was identified. 
Evaluation of Each Laboratory Parameter  
Part A 
Mean values were variable and showed no clinically notable trends over time. There were no clinically notable 
trends  or  safety  concerns  identified  in  these  chemistry  parameters.  No  subjects  had  LFT  results  that  met 
threshold criteria. A total of 3 (27.3%) subjects had a ≥30% change from baseline in creatinine; the only other

chemistry finding occurred in 1 subject. There were no AEs related to chemistry findings, including LFT results, 
in Part A. 
Part B 
LFT Results 
Mean ALT and AST concentrations showed transient elevations at Week 4 and returned to baseline values by 
Week 8. At Week 4, the mean ALT concentration was 52.4 U/L (normal reference range: 5 to 30 U/L) and the 
mean  AST  concentration  was  61.7  U/L  (normal  reference  range:  0  to  55  U/L).  At  other  time  points, 
concentrations  were  within  or  slightly  above  normal.  Mean  GGT  concentration  was  relatively  stable  with  no 
consistent  pattern  of  change.  Mean  ALP  and  bilirubin  concentrations  stabilized  below  baseline  from  Day  15 
onward; the mean ALP concentration (but not bilirubin) returned to baseline at the Follow-up Visit. No subjects 
had elevations in total bilirubin or ALP. The percentage of subjects with an ALT or AST elevation was 15.0% at 
the >3 × ULN threshold, 11.7% at the >5 × ULN threshold, and 8.3% at the >8 × ULN threshold. 
Renal function, creatinine 
A total of 18 (30.0%) subjects had a ≥30% change from baseline in creatinine, and 1 (1.7%) subject had a ≥
100% change from baseline in creatinine; all other chemistry findings occurred in 4 subjects or fewer. There 
were no clinically notable trends or safety concerns identified in other chemistry parameters.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Part A 
Of the 12 subjects in Part A, 1 (8.3%) subject had an AE that led to LUM/IVA discontinuation. The subject had 
an AE of respiratory rate increased that was considered moderate in severity and possibly related to LUM/IVA 
and that resolved without treatment after 4 days. 
Part B 
A total of 3 (5.0%) subjects had AEs that led to LUM/IVA discontinuation, all of which were LFT elevations that 
were considered possibly related to LUM/IVA. 
AEs That Led to Interruption of Study Drug 
There were no AEs that led to LUM/IVA interruption in Study 115 Part A. Three (5.0%) subjects had AEs that led 
to LUM/IVA interruption. By PT, ALT increased and AST increased each occurred in 2 (3.3%) subjects, and 
constipation occurred in 1 (1.7%) subject. All AEs that led to LUM/IVA interruption had an outcome of resolved.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The only relevant safety data for this extension of indication originate from study 115, which enrolled CF children 
aged 2 and 5 years of age inclusive, with confirmed diagnosis of CF, homozygous for F508del, either 
symptomatic or with a sweat chloride value ≥ 60 mmol/L. In addition, safety data from 16 adults included in the 
Phase 1 bioavailability study (study 014) as well as 4 included in the taste profiling study were also presented, 
although the relevance of these data is limited as these were healthy adults. As a consequence, the main 
discussion on safety data focuses on study 115.  
In part A of study 115, 4 subjects received the L100/I125q12h dose and 8 subjects received the L150/I188q12h 
dose; the mean LUM/IVA exposure was 14.4 days. In part B of the study 19 subjects received the 
L100/I125q12h dose and 41 subjects received the L150/I188q12h dose; the mean LUM/IVA exposure was 
159.7 days.  In the LCI substudy set, 5 subjects received the L100/I125q12h dose and 32 subjects received the 
L150/I188q12h dose. Thus, only limited data in the 2-5 year patient population, with only short term exposure 
(up to 6 months) are available to characterize safety profile of the drug in this patient population. Therefore, the 
CHMP requested that the MAH performs a long-term effectiveness study, to compare disease progression among 
children with CF homozygous for F508del-CFTR and are aged 2 through 5 years at the time of Orkambi 
treatment initiation versus disease progression among concurrent matched cohort of children with CF who have 
never received Orkambi treatment, in addition to a longitudinal historical cohort. This has been agreed. 
Part A of study 115: All subjects (4/4) in the L100/I125q12h dose and 6/9 subjects in the L100/I125q12h dose, 
reported at least an AE, indicating that safety issues start very soon after treatment. In total 10 patients in Part 
A reported a total of 20 AEs (11 events occurred in subjects receiving the lower dose and 9 events in subjects 
receiving the higher dose). One subject receiving L150/I188q12h dose discontinued LUM/IVA due to an AE of 
respiratory rate increased, moderate in severity and possibly related to LUM/IVA that resolved without 
treatment. All other AEs were mild in severity. No SAE occurred. Cough (5 events), rhinorrhoea, faeces soft and 
vomiting (2 events each) were the most frequent events that occurred in Part A of the study, while all other 
events were single occurrences. Among the single occurrences of AEs, there was one event each of faeces 
discoloured and hyperhidrosis, both occurring in patients in the L100/I125q12h group and both considered drug 
related by the investigator.  
Part B of study 115: Almost all patients reported at least an AE (19/19 in the L100/I125q12h dose and 40/41 
subjects in the L100/I125q12h dose group). By preferred term, adverse events with an incidence ≥10% were 
cough, vomiting, pyrexia, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, upper respiratory tract infection, ALT increased, ear 
infection, constipation , diarrhoea  and AST increased. The most common related AEs (≥5% incidence overall) 
were cough, ALT increased, AST increased, nasal congestion and vomiting. Overall, the AEs were mostly 
consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in subjects 2 through 5 years of 
age. A total of 4 (6.7%) subjects had at least 1 SAE in Part B of study 115. Two (3.3%) subjects had SAEs of 
infective PEx (Pulmonary Exacerbation) of CF, which is a common manifestation of CF disease, and 1 (1.7%) 
subject each had SAEs of gastroenteritis viral and constipation, both severe in intensity. The SAE of constipation 
was considered related (possibly related, as determined by the investigator) to LUM/IVA and led to LUM/IVA 
interruption. All SAEs resolved. 3/19 subjects (16%) in the L100/I125q12h dose and 2/41 subjects (5%) in the 
L100/I125q12h dose group reported an AE of Pseudomonas test positive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/843650/2018 
Page 48/65 
  
  
Even though the limited number of enrolled subjects, particularly in the low dose group (n=19) must be 
considered in the interpretation of data, the frequency of subjects with Serious Adverse events (2/19, 10.5%: 
gastroenteritis viral and constipation) was higher in the group of subjects weighing less than 14 kg compared 
with the group >14 kg ( 2/41, 4.9%, two events of pulmonary exacerbations), as well as the frequency of 
subjects with AEs leading to LUM/IVA interruption (2 events, 10.5% transaminase increased and constipation  
vs 1 event, 2.4%, transaminase increased). 
Among AESI, AEs of elevated transaminases (8/60, 13%, frequency category very common) and permanent 
treatment discontinuation due to AEs of elevated transaminases (5%) as well as the maximum transaminase 
levels (ALT or AST elevation >3 × ULN: 15.0%; >5 × ULN threshold: 11.7% at the, and >8 × ULN threshold: 
8.3%), occurred with higher frequency in the 2-5 years old age subjects compared to the 6-12 years age 
category. Two subjects had AESIs of elevated transaminases that were severe. Two subjects (3.3%) had AESIs 
of elevated transaminases that led to LUM/IVA interruption and three subjects (5%) discontinued treatment due 
to an AESI of elevated transaminases.  Among the 8 subjects with AESIs of elevated transaminases, the median 
time-to-onset of the first AESI was 29.0 days overall, and the mean (SD) duration of events was 39.2 (40.6) 
days. Exclusion criteria excluded subjects having at baseline >2UNL of transaminases.  The current 4.4 section 
of the SmPC reports information about the occurrence of transaminases and/or bilirubin increase in patients with 
CF receiving LUM/IVA and different risk minimization measures as well as dose adjustment are reported to 
minimise hepatobiliary toxicity and related events. Although these measures could apply to the 2-5 age group 
as well a more adequate information was added in the relevant SmPC sections (including section 4.4) to inform 
the prescriber that AEs of elevated transaminases have been observed with higher frequency in this younger age 
group, as compared to the 6-12 years age category.  
The AESI respiratory events (asthma, bronchial hyper-reactivity, bronchospasm, chest discomfort, dyspnoea, 
respiration abnormal, wheezing) occurred in 6 (10.0%) of subjects. All AESIs of respiratory events were mild (3 
of 6 subjects) or moderate (3 of 6 subjects) in severity, with a median time-to-onset of the first AESI of 9 days, 
and a mean (SD) duration of events of 6.1 (7.2) days. No subjects had AESIs of respiratory events that led to 
interruption or discontinuation of treatment. No subject had a serious AESI of respiratory events.  
As regards to other categorical changes in chemistry laboratory values, in Part A in the L100/I125q12h dose 
group,  3/7 subjects had a ≥30% change from baseline of creatinine and 1/7 subjects had potassium increase 
>=5.5 mmol/L. Similarly, in Part B of the study: A total of 18 (30.0%) subjects had a ≥30% change from 
baseline in creatinine, and 1 (1.7%) subject receiving L100/I125q12h dose had a ≥100% change from baseline 
in creatinine; potassium >=5.5 mmol/L occurred in 3 (5%) subjects.  This information appears new as 
compared with known safety profile. In the MAH’s view the observed increases in potassium levels and 
creatinine are likely due to normal variability seen during the study. None of observed the potassium or 
creatinine increases were persistent throughout the study, but were rather increases observed at single time 
points.  None of these subjects required study dose interruption or discontinuation due to potassium elevations 
or creatinine increase. Overall, it is acknowledged that available data do not allow any conclusion on an effect of 
LUM/IVA on kidney function in the 2-5 years age range but this issue will be monitored in ongoing long term 
safety studies and in the PAES. The SmPC states that caution is recommended while using Orkambi in patients 
with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end stage renal disease. 
Blood pressure increase is a known ADR of LUM/IVA (frequency category uncommon in the current SmPC), and 
a warning on the need to monitor periodically blood pressure in all patients during treatment is present in section 
4.4 of the SmPC. Even though no subject in Study 115 had AE related to increased blood pressure, a high 
percentage of subjects had SBP and DBP values ≥99th percentile, particularly in the group of children weighing 
less than 14 kg (SBP: 10/19, 52.6% and 15/ 41, 36.6%; DBP: 9/19, 47.4% and 12/41, 29.3% in the 
Assessment report

Page 49/65 
  
  
L100/I125q12h dose and in the L150/I188q12h dose group respectively). The SmPC already includes a 
warning/precaution of blood pressure increase and recommends blood pressure monitoring when receiving 
Orkambi treatment regardless of age group or weight and thus no additional changes are deemed necessary at 
this time. The issue of the effect of LUM/IVA on blood pressure in the age range 2-5 years will continued to be 
monitored in the ongoing long term safety study.  
In Part A of the study, a postdose heart rate (HR) decrease was observed. The greatest mean change from 
baseline in the overall population was -13.4 bpm at 4 hours postdose on Day 1; postdose changes were minimal 
on Day 15. Similarly, in Part B of Study 115, a postdose HR decrease was observed. The mean change from 
baseline in the overall population was -8.5 bpm at 4 hours postdose on Day 1; other postdose time points were 
not assessed. Clinical relevance of heart rate decrease is classified as missing information in the RMP.  
In Part A of the study 2/4 subjects in the L100/I125q12h dose group had a QTcF increase ≥30 to ≤60 msec. 7/10 
subjects with normal ECG at baseline and 1/1 subject with abnormal ECG at baseline had a post baseline 
abnormal ECG evaluation classified as clinically insignificant.  
In Part B of study 115, a total of 5 (8.3%) subjects had an HR of ≥120 bpm with an increase from baseline of 
≥20 bpm, and 11 (18.3%) subjects had a QTcF increase from baseline of ≥30 to ≤60 msec. No subject had a 
QTcF increase from baseline of >60 msec or an absolute value of ≥500 msec. All AEs related to ECG parameters 
or in the SOC of cardiac disorders (2 in total) were mild in severity, were not considered serious, and did not lead 
to LUM/IVA interruption or discontinuation. 
Overall, it is noted that the follow-up in the conducted studies is only 6-month and long term data are needed 
in order to better define the safety profile of Orkambi. The MAH agreed that the long term safety data can be 
provided by the MAH from the PAES. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials 
have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of Orkambi in this age group seems generally the same as that reported for older subjects. 
However, in the youngest group some AEs, i.e. transaminases increase, has been observed more frequently 
than in older patients. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Moreover, the follow-up is limited to a 6-month time period. Further safety data with drug exposure longer than 
6 months are needed. The MAH agreed that the long term safety data safety data will also be provided by the 
MAH from the PAES besides data from the ongoing safety Studies 809-108 (PASS), Study 110 and 809-116. The 
MAH hence commits to conducting a PAES for patients 2- to 5-years-old at initiation of Orkambi (see section on 
clinical efficacy).

information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The current line extension application is for an extension of indication to children 2-5 years old, from the 
currently approved target population of cystic fibrosis patients 6 years and older, homozygous for 
F508del-CFTR. Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor; LUM/IVA) 200mg/125mg film-coated tablet was approved in the 
EU on 19 November 2015 for the following indication: treatment of CF in patients aged 12 years and older who 
are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. Orkambi 100mg/125mg film-coated tablet was 
further approved in the EU on 8 January 2018 for the following indication extension: treatment of CF in patients 
aged 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.  
This line extension proposes a new formulation, i.e. granules in the following strengths:  
•  Orkambi (Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor) 100 mg/125 mg granules in sachet  
•  Orkambi (Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor) 150 mg/188 mg granules in sachet 
The dose regimens proposed vary by weight of the child, with a cut off at 14 kg. The aim of therapy is to modify 
the course of the disease due to correction/improvement in chloride channel function. Changes in ppFEV1, the 
recommended primary endpoint to be used for registration studies as outlined in the CHMP guideline, 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008, are not easily and reliably registered in children from birth through 5 years of age 
because spirometry can only be performed in children > 6 years of age and spirometry parameters are not 
sufficiently sensitive to detect early manifestations of lung disease in young children with CF. Lung Clearance 
Index (LCI) has been proposed as a surrogate exploratory endpoint to measure lung ventilation inhomogeneity 
in recruited collaborative children who were ≥3 years of age, as a potentially  more sensitive measurement than 
ppFEV1during the early stages of lung disease progression. A strong linear correlation has been noted between 
LCI and FEV1 in collaborative patients, in several studies (Mulligan M et al 2017. Ir Med J; 110:629). However, 
technical difficulties have been registered in patients under six years of age (Saunders C et al 2017. Curr Med 
Res Opin; 33: 613-620). Only limited comparative data of normal range of LCI in CF people and age matched 
healthy control subjects are available in very young people (O’Neill K et al.2016.Chest;150:1323-1332; Horsley 
AR et al 2008. Thorax; 63:135-140), and even more importantly, no consensus has been reached at present, in 
the literature, regarding the minimal clinically important differences in the LCI endpoint. Longer longitudinal 
observations in younger patients in whom lung disease progression is very low would be needed to guide test 
result interpretation. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and poor nutritional status are among the most 
significant clinical manifestations of CF in infants. These factors often lead to poor growth with subsequent 
growth delay, poorer cognitive development, and other clinical comorbidities such as decreased lung function 
and survival.  Malnourishment is associated with worsening in lung function in children with CF and is an 
independent predictor of mortality in this population. Data in the literature suggest that early therapeutic 
intervention is beneficial to young children with CF; studies have demonstrated benefits such as improved 
measures of growth, nutrition, and lung disease through early intervention in children diagnosed by newborn 
screening.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are no specific targeted therapies for F508del (class II mutation) CF children aged <6 years old. At 
present these patients with CF and clinical manifestations receive mainly supportive therapies for controlling 
exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) and lung disease. There is thus a recognised unmet clinical need for new 
effective therapies able to interfere with CF progression, prolong survival and improve patients’ quality of life. 
Lumacaftor (LUM, a CFTR corrector) has been developed in combination with ivacaftor (IVA, a CFTR potentiator) 
as a fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet for oral administration in the treatment of CF patients homozygous for 
the F508del-CFTR mutation. This genotype is present in ~40% of the CF population and  results in a severe  form 
of the disease that requires the combined action of lumacaftor to correct processing and trafficking of the CFTR 
conductance channel, with the potentiator action of ivacaftor to enhance channel open probability. The FDC is 
currently authorised in the EU as Orkambi, for CF patients 6 years and older homozygous for F508del-CFTR. 
Ivacaftor is authorised as Kalydeco as monotherapy treatment for CF in patients aged 6 years and older who 
have one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, 
G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R. In the EU the targeted therapy with Kalydeco (containing ivacaftor, 
one of the two active components of Orkambi) has been recently authorized in children with CF aged 2 years and 
older and weighing less than 25 kg who have specific CFTR gating defects (class III mutations). The extension 
of indication in children aged 2 to 5 years old was granted for Kalydeco based on extrapolation of efficacy from 
older patients and on the assumption that early initiation with a targeted therapy would result in a better disease 
control and possibly prolonged survival of CF patients. However, long-term effectiveness and safety of Kalydeco 
when administered to the 2-5 years CF patient population are currently under investigation in a 
post-authorization efficacy study (PAES) using the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) registry and the UK 
Cystic Fibrosis registry-based data capture as described in the RMP and outlined in Annex II of the marketing 
authorisation. 
Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of patients with 
cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are 
heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the following mutations in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 
711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
Lumacaftor  and ivacaftor target the biochemical defect in the chloride channel protein whereas all other current 
treatments for CF alleviate the clinical manifestations of the disease but do not act on the underlying chloride 
channel defect. Current treatments include inhaled mucolytics, bronchodilators, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory 
medicines, and pancreatic enzymes. The new FDC of Orkambi granules submitted with the line extension could 
fulfil an unmet need in the extended target population 2-5 years as evidence of clinical benefit in this age group 
has been provided.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This extension of indication of Orkambi to homozygous F508del CF children aged 2 to 5 years is based on a single 
study 115, a Phase 3, two-part, open-label study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of Orkambi in the patient population target of the present variation procedure. No dedicated 
efficacy study has been submitted in support of the present extension of indication, and the demonstration of 
efficacy relies on the extrapolation from older subjects, on the base of the claim of disease similarity across age 
groups. The Concept paper on the need for revision of the Guideline on the Clinical Development of medicinal 
products for the treatment of Cystic Fybrosis identifies, among issues to be addressed, the feasibility of 
Assessment report  
EMA/843650/2018 
Page 57/65 
  
  
extrapolating between different age groups and definition of clinical endpoints suitable for young children.  
Based on this extrapolation approach, Kalydeco (ivacaftor), indicated for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis in 
patients with CFTR mutation that causes a CFTR gating defect, received in November 2015 an extension of 
indication in the 2 to less than 6 years age range.  
Study 115 was a Phase 3, 2-part, open-label, multicentre study in subjects 2 through 5 years of age with CF, 
homozygous for F508del. Part A evaluated the PK and safety of LUM/IVA administered for 15 days. Safety, 
tolerability, and available PK data from Part A were reviewed to determine the dose(s) to be evaluated in Part B. 
No primary efficacy end points were identified as efficacy was extrapolated from trials in older age groups.  
The following clinical endpoints were assessed 24 weeks after treatment initiation: Sweat chloride, body mass 
index (BMI), BMI-for-age z-score, weight, weight-for-age z-score, stature, stature-for-age z-score, pulmonary 
exacerbations (PExs), CF-related hospitalizations, faecal elastase-1 (FE-1), immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), 
qualitative microbiology cultures, spirometry (subjects ≥3 years of age at screening of Parts A and B), 
acceptability and palatability of LUM/IVA granules, lung clearance index (LCI) (subjects ≥3 years of age at 
screening of Part B who consented and assented to the optional LCI Sub study). 
There was no comparison group. Analyses included change from baseline at 24 weeks and in some endpoints, 
effects of discontinuation of treatment at week 24, measured at week 26. In study 115, Part B, 60 subjects (19 
subjects in the L100/I125q12h and 41 subjects in the L150/I188q12h) were enrolled, 3 subjects (5.0%) 
discontinued due to adverse events, and one subject discontinued prematurely due to miscommunication with 
previous study coordinator; all other subjects completed the 24 weeks treatment period. All 57 subjects who 
completed the study, including the subject who prematurely discontinued study treatment, rolled over into a 
2-year extension study (Study 116). Thirty-seven subjects participated in the LCI Substudy.  Children recruited 
in Study 115, although by an indirect comparison with European CF registries, can be considered as a cohort 
sufficiently representative of European young children with CF. 
The major deficiencies of study 115 is the lack of a placebo control arm, together with the limited duration (only 
6 months) given the slow disease progression in the 2-5 years age range compared with older ages. Acceptance 
of this study design to support the extension of indication in very young CF children, aged 2 to 5 years old, is 
made on the basis that extrapolation of Orkambi efficacy from older children and adults to the younger children 
enrolled in study 115. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
There was a statistically significant improvement (i.e., a reduction) in sweat chloride concentration in the overall 
population after LUM/IVA treatment, with a mean absolute change from baseline at Week 24 of -31.7 mmol/L 
(P<0.0001). The improvement in sweat chloride concentration was reversed after a 2-week Washout Period 
without LUM/IVA treatment. The mean absolute change in sweat chloride concentration from Week 24 at Week 
26 was 33.0 mmol/L (P<0.0001) in the overall population. 
After treatment with LUM/IVA, the overall population showed a statistically significant improvement in

•  Stature-for-age z-score: mean absolute change from baseline of 0.09 (P = 0.0104) 
Through Week 24, 18 (30.0%) subjects had PEx events. The normalized number of PExs (event rate per patient 
year) was 0.90 for PExs and0.20 for CF-related hospitalizations.  
After treatment with LUM/IVA, the overall population showed a statistically significant improvement in FE-1 at 
Week 24 and IRT through Week 24, suggesting the potential of LUM/IVA to improve pancreatic function: 
• 
• 
FE-1: mean absolute change from baseline of 52.6 µg/g (P = 0.0012) 
IRT: mean absolute change from baseline of -130.2 ng/mL (P < 0.0001) 
No notable changes from baseline were observed in microbiology cultures at Week 24. For all bacterial species 
tested, the majority of subjects had a negative culture result at both time points. 
No notable changes from baseline were observed in ppFEV1 at Week 24. Limited data were available due to the 
difficulty of obtaining spirometry measurements in young children (12 subjects had both a baseline and a Week 
24 measurement available). 
In acceptability and palatability assessments, when consuming food containing LUM/IVA mixture, 17.9% of 
subjects “liked it very much” and 12.5% “liked it a little.” Overall, 58 (96.7%) subjects were ≥80% 
compliant with LUM/IVA dosing in Part B. 
In the LCI Sub study, the overall population had a mean change from baseline in LCI2.5 at Week 24 of -0.58 (P 
= 0.0559). The LCI5.0 showed no meaningful change from baseline during the treatment period. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The main uncertainty is related to the clinically relevance of the PD endpoints seen in Study 115. While these 
may be statistically significant, the clinical significance of the change and its relationship to clinical outcomes 
needs to be clearly demonstrated. It is acknowledged that robust outcomes like FEV are difficult to measure in 
small children. Also, lung function is relatively well maintained in small children with CF. No reliable assessment 
of treatment effect on pulmonary function is possible based on the provided data. Changes in ppFEV1, the 
recommended primary endpoint in CF studies, are both not easily evaluable as well as not sufficiently sensitive 
in this age group. Moreover, the use of the Lung Clearance Index (LCI) is hampered by both technical limitations 
in the assay performance in patients under six years of age, as well as to incomplete knowledge of the range of 
LCI in CF people of very young age and age matched healthy control subjects. Thus it is difficult to disentangle 
treatment effect from variability due to asymptomatic disease. The results of a within group analysis are harder 
to interpret than if a counterfactual group had been included, even though in case of some outcomes, a degree 
of deterioration is seen on discontinuation of treatment. While this is supportive in ascribing benefit of 
treatment, the clinical relevance of the magnitude of change from baseline to week 24 and from 24 to 26 has not 
been fully justified. During the evaluation procedure, additional data from ongoing studies 116 and 110 were 
provided that in general suggesting sweat chloride level at week 48 is similar to that observed at week 24, 
though a small numerically declining trend is noted. A similar trend is observed with for growth parameter (BMI, 
weight for age, and height for age) Z scores. Additional data are awaited after closure of both studies in 2019 
and from the PAES to which the MAH committed.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The 24-week, un controlled Study 115 (part B ) showed that administration of LUM/IVA was overall safe and well 
tolerated for up to 24 weeks in subjects 2-5 years of age. The common AEs observed were mostly manifestations 
of CF disease. No new safety concerns were identified compared with subjects age 6 years and older. The 
Cumulative exposure of children 2-5 years old in these studies was 26.5 years. The most common AE 
relationship was possibly related to LUM/IVA (as determined by the investigator). A total of 29 (48.3%) subjects 
had at least 1 AE considered related to LUM/IVA (related [3.3%] or possibly related [45.0%], as determined by 
the investigator). The majority of subjects had AEs that were considered mild (29 subjects [48.3%]) or 
moderate (25 subjects [41.7%]) in severity A total of 5 (8.3%) subjects had severe AEs. Three (5.0%) subjects 
had at least 1 AE that led to LUM/IVA discontinuation and three (5.0%) subjects had at least 1 AE that led to 
LUM/IVA interruption (2 had elevated transaminases and 1 had constipation). Four (6.7%) subjects had SAEs.  
Elevated transaminases: A total of 8 (13.3%) subjects had AESIs of elevated transaminases. The  ALT increased 
occurred in 8 (13.3%) subjects and AST increased occurred in 6 (10.0%) subjects. The majority of AESIs of 
elevated transaminases were mild (5 of 8 subjects) or moderate (1 of 8 subjects) in severity. Two subjects had 
AESIs of elevated transaminases that were severe. No life-threatening AESIs of elevated transaminases 
occurred. 
Respiratory symptoms: A total of 3 (5.0%) subjects had AESIs of respiratory symptoms. Dyspnoea occurred in 
3 (5.0%) subjects and respiration abnormal occurred in 1 (1.7%) subject. All AESIs of respiratory symptoms 
were mild (2 of 3 subjects) or moderate (1 of 3 subjects) in severity. Serial spirometry assessments were 
obtained on Day 1 to evaluate postdose FEV1, and a postdose decline was observed. Because of the difficulty of 
performing spirometry in young children, limited data were available and showed substantial variability. Based 
on data from 10 subjects with postdose evaluations at 2 and/or 4 hours, and taking the lowest postdose 
measurement per subject, the mean change from predose ppFEV1 was -13.7 percentage points. This decline in 
ppFEV1 was generally asymptomatic, with few respiratory AESIs observed on Day 1, and not associated with 
any meaningful change in respiratory rate or pulse oximetry. 
The deficiencies of study 115 is the lack of a placebo control arm, together with the limited duration (only 6 
months) given the slow disease progression in the 2-5 years age range compared with older ages. Acceptance 
of this study design to support the extension of indication in very young CF children, aged 2 to 5 years old, is 
made on the basis that extrapolation of Orkambi efficacy from older children and adults to the younger children 
enrolled in study 115. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data exposure in total is relatively small in this age group (60 participants over 6 months). This period 
is too small to adequately characterise the safety profile when used in 2-5y olds. The safety profile is considered 
sufficiently characterized for marketing authorisation but it is considered important to generate further post 
authorisation efficacy and safety data by means of a PAES to address relevant uncertainties. Further data are 
expected to be generated by the ongoing clinical programme being conducted by the MAH and by the imposed 
PAES study to which the MAH committed.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Cystic fibrosis represents an area with a high-unmet medical need for specific targeted therapies. Studies 
performed in CF children diagnosed by newborn screening suggest that early intervention is associated with an 
improvement in nutritional status and lung disease.  
Available data from study 115 show a consistent positive trend in the amelioration of PD parameters (i.e. change 
from baseline in sweat chloride, FE-1 level, IRT) following Orkambi treatment. This extension of indication to 
very young CF children, aged 2 to 5 years old, is made on the basis of the extrapolation of Orkambi efficacy from 
older children and adults to the younger children enrolled in study 115. Therefore the PD parameters are 
acceptable to assume a similar clinical benefit for younger children. This uncontrolled study showed a statistical 
improvement in PD parameters. The clinical relevance of some parameters may not be fully ascertained, but 
efficacy is being extrapolated from other trials. It is understood that lung function parameters are difficult to 
assess in young children and a full efficacy study may not be feasible and hence extrapolation from older age 
groups has been applied. However, given that the disease is usually less sever in younger children and that there 
is little deterioration in lung function, further data are expected to be generated in the imposed long term 
prospective study.  
The safety data set in the 2-5 year CF patient population is limited both in terms of number of exposed children 
as well as in terms of follow-up, and a complete characterisation of the safety profile of Orkambi in this age 
group is thus not possible at present. Therefore, further safety data with drug exposure longer than 6 months 
are needed and will be generated in the imposed PAES. It is important to consider that there are no treatments 
approved for this age group in homozygous the F508del patients and therefore, the proposed product fills a 
treatment gap.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
No confirmatory clinical efficacy studies have been provided. However this acceptable given that this is an 
extrapolation of efficacy based on efficacy data from older age groups. PK studies have been done in the 
Assessment report

proposed age group and do not give rise to concerns. Available data from study 115 show a consistent positive 
trend in the amelioration of PD parameters (i.e. change from baseline in sweat chloride, FE-1 level, IRT) 
following Orkambi treatment in very young CF children, aged 2 to 5 years old. This results give sufficient 
certainty that extrapolation of Orkambi efficacy to this patient population can be applied based on data from 
older children and adults. However, taking into consideration the unvalidated status of the PD biomarker and 
some uncertainties given the size of the effect for Orkambi in adults, further clinical study data are expected to 
be generated post authorization in the imposed long term prospective study. This study is expected to provide 
verification of the impact of Orkambi treatment on clinical outcomes (including long term safety) and disease 
progression and to confirm current efficacy and safety assumptions. To fulfil this expectation the study will 
answer whether children with CF homozygous for f508del-CFTR (F/F) and who are treated with Orkambi early in 
life will have less advanced disease when they become older compared to those who were never treated with 
Orkambi (or other CFTR modulator) or who initiated treatment with Orkambi at a later age. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Orkambi in the proposed indication is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) is not similar to Bronchitol 
(mannitol), Cayston (aztreonam), TOBI Podhaler (tobramycin) Kalydeco (ivacaftor) and Symkevi 
(tezacafor/Ivacaftor) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of, Orkambi 100 mg/125 mg and 150 mg/188 mg granules   is favourable in the following 
indication: 
Orkambi granules are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in children aged 2 years and older who 
are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Orkambi subject to the 
following conditions:

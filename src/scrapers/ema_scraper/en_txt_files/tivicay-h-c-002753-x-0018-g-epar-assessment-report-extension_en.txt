1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
ViiV Healthcare UK Limited submitted on 11 December 2015 a group of variation(s) consisting of an extension 
of the marketing authorisation and the following variation: 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
The MAH applied for addition of two new strengths (10mg and 25mg film-coated tablets) to support the 
extension of the target population covered by the authorised therapeutic indication for Tivicay to treat paediatric 
patients from 6 years of age infected with HIV. 
In addition, the MAH proposed to extend the indication for Tivicay to treat paediatric patients from 6 years of age 
infected with HIV with the approved 50mg film-coated tablets.  
The MAH has updated section 4.2 of the SmPC with dose recommendations for the use of Tivicay in children 6 to 
less than 12 years of age.  
Sections 4.5, 4.7, 4.8 and 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have also been updated to include relevant information about 
the clinical trial ING112578 in support of the new therapeutic indication. 
Section 5.3 of the SmPC was updated to reflect the non-clinical investigations performed for the paediatric 
development program. 
The MAH applied for the following indication for Tivicay 10mg, 25mg film-coated tablets: 
Tivicay is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults, adolescents and children above 6 years of age. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008- Grouping of variations. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on MAH’s own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0061/2015 
on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0061/2015 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Combination antiviral therapy with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) protease and reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors has significantly reduced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related 
morbidity and mortality. However, emerging multi-class drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
strains as well as potential long-term toxicities warrant development of new antiretroviral therapies without or 
with limited cross-resistance to available drugs. 
About the product 
Tivicay (Dolutegravir, DTG) was first authorised in the US on 12 August 2013 and in the EU on 16 Jan 2014. DTG 
is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INI), currently indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency 
virus type 1 (HIV-1) in patients above 12 years of age. 
INIs are a newer class of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs designed to block the action of the integrase (IN) viral 
enzyme, which catalyses two key steps in the HIV life cycle and is responsible for insertion of the viral genome 
into the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the host cell. Since genome integration is a vital step in retroviral 
replication, it is an attractive target for HIV therapy. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 10 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg of dolutegravir (as 
dolutegravir sodium) as active substance. The 10 mg and 25 mg strengths are being introduced to the already 
authorised 50 mg film-coated tablets with this line extension. 
Other ingredients of the tablet core are: mannitol (E421), microcrystalline cellulose, povidone K29/32, sodium 
starch glycolate and sodium stearyl fumarate. Ingredients of the film-coating are: polyvinyl alcohol-partially 
hydrolysed, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol, talc, and, for 25 mg tablets only, iron oxide yellow (E172). 
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles closed with polypropylene (PP) screw 
closures, with a polyethylene faced induction heat seal liner. Each bottle of Tivicay 10 mg film-coated tablets 
contains a desiccant, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/601663/20177 
Page 10/54 
  
  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance dolutegravir sodium, used to manufacture Tivicay 10 mg and 25 mg film-coated tablets, is 
the same as that used for the manufacture of the authorised Tivicay 50 mg film-coated tablets. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of this grouped type II variation and line extension is to extend the therapeutic indication for Tivicay to 
include children from 6 to 12 years of age, and to introduce two new film-coated tablet strengths: 10 mg and 25 
mg, in order to facilitate dosing to children. 
The finished product is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets for oral administration. The 10 mg 
strength is presented as white, round, biconvex tablets, approximately 6 mm in diameter, debossed with ‘SV 
572’ on one side and ‘10’ on the other side. The 25 mg strength is presented as pale yellow, round, biconvex 
tablets approximately 7 mm in diameter debossed with ‘SV 572’ on one side and ‘25’ on the other side. The 10 
mg and 25 mg film-coated tablets are distinguishable by their colour, size and debossing both between 
themselves and from the previously authorised 50 mg film-coated tablets. 
The size and shape of the 10 and 25 mg film-coated tablets, as well the composition in excipients, is considered 
appropriate for the target age groups (6 to 12 years of age). The acceptability of the finished product is validated 
by its use in the paediatric clinical trials. 
The composition of the 10 and 25 mg core tablets includes dolutegravir (as dolutegravir sodium), mannitol, 
microcrystalline cellulose, povidone K29/32, sodium starch glycolate and sodium stearyl fumarate.  The 
film-coating includes polyvinyl alcohol-partially hydrolysed, titanium dioxide, macrogol, talc, and, iron oxide 
yellow (25 mg tablets only). 
The pharmaceutical development approach that was used for the design and development of Tivicay film-coated 
tablets contains quality by design (QbD) elements. A combination of risk based assessments using structured 
methodologies such as failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), laboratory studies, and prior knowledge and 
product specific understanding based on development history was used to gain a comprehensive understanding 
of the formulation and process conditions and their impact on the quality attributes of the finished product. No 
design space was proposed. 
The formulations of Tivicay 10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg film-coated tablets share the same principal composition. 
The excipients used in the 10 mg and 25 mg film-coated tablets are the same as in the authorised 50 mg 
film-coated tablets. Therefore, no additional drug / excipient compatibility studies were performed. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards or 
the EC Regulation 231/2012. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The primary packaging consists of HDPE bottles closed with PP screw closures, with a polyethylene faced 
induction heat seal liner. The bottles for 10 mg contain a desiccant. The primary packaging material complies 
with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. Confirmation of the child-resistant closure compliance with EN ISO 8317 has 
been provided. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate 
for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process and includes granulation, 
blending, compression, and film coating.  It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable 
of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description (visual), 
identification  of  dolutegravir  (UV  and  HPLC),  dolutegravir  content  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  uniformity  of 
content (HPLC), dissolution (UV), microbial enumeration test (Ph. Eur.) and water content (KF).  
A  test  for  impurities  is  not  included  in  the  finished  product  release  specification,  which  was  justified  in 
accordance with ICH Q6A.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches of 10 mg and 25 mg film-coated tablets 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of each strength of the finished product stored under long term 
conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH for up to 36 months and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC 
/ 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative 
of those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years with no special storage conditions, as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. The 10 mg tablet strength should be stored in the original package in 
order to protect form moisture and the desiccant should not be removed. 
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal drug product 
Not applicable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The 
applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its manufacturing process. 
However, no design space was claimed for the manufacturing process. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion 
that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Dolutegravir (DTG) is referred to as a second generation integrase inhibitor, with activity against raltegravir 
resistant viruses. DTG binds to the HIV integrase active site blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA 
integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. The IC50 of DTG against the purified enzyme HIV-1 
integrase ranged from 2.7 nM to 12.6 nM. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
In vitro, DTG inhibited the binding of radiolabeled α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) to the human 
recombinant melanocortin 4 (MC4R) receptor by 64% at a concentration equal to the clinical Cmax. The MC4R is 
involved notably in the regulation of energy homeostasis and food intake, and deficiency in the MC4R is 
associated with monogenic obesity. There were no findings associated with MC4R in toxicity studies, and no 
clinically significant patterns of changes in vital signs across the clinical studies. 
Safety pharmacology 
Results from safety pharmacology studies indicated that single oral doses of DTG up to 500 (rat) and 1000 
(monkey) mg/kg have a low likelihood to induce acute effects on major organ function in the central nervous, 
respiratory and cardiovascular systems. 
In summary, the pharmacology of DTG was thoroughly evaluated during the marketing authorisation application 
for Tivicay. No new non-clinical pharmacology studies were submitted in support of the present application. The 
CHMP considered this as acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/601663/20177 
Page 13/54 
  
  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Bioavailability of DTG in rat and monkey ranged from 25 to 34% and increased to levels of 76 to 87% after 
fasting. With increasing doses systemic exposure levels increased although less than dose-proportionally. 
Systemic exposure levels were overall similar at similar doses in animals given intramuscular or subcutaneous 
doses. After repeated doses there was a trend for increased exposure in female animals compared with males 
although this gender difference was not consistently observed. 
Distribution 
Distribution studies in rats indicated highest levels of radiolabel at 6 hours post dose and tissues with highest 
radioactivity included liver, adrenal medulla, myocardium, pigmented skin, renal cortex and renal medulla, lung 
and lymph nodes. Levels in the brain were low, but quantifiable. Studies in pregnant rats showed that DTG 
crossed the placenta and that foetal radioactivity was highest in blood, myocardium and muscle. In addition 
lacteal transfer of DTG was evident. 
Metabolism 
In vitro studies in rat and human liver microsomes showed that a metabolite of DTG, consistent with addition of 
glutathione through oxidative defluorination, was formed. Data indicated that DTG induced a formation of an 
electrophilic metabolite in rat and human microsomes. The significance of the formation of this metabolite is 
likely limited at doses relevant for the clinical setting. Metabolic profiling in mouse and rat showed that DTG was 
the major radiolabelled compound in plasma, liver and faeces. In monkey, DTG was the major radiolabelled 
compound in plasma. In bile major components were glucuronide and hexose conjugates. 
Excretion 
In mouse, rat and monkey the major part of the radioactivity was eliminated in faeces. 
Bioavailability of DTG in rat and monkey ranged from 25 to 34% and increased to levels of 76 to 87% after 
fasting. Distribution studies in rats indicated highest levels of radiolabel at 6 hours post dose. Studies in 
pregnant rats showed that DTG crossed the placenta and that foetal radioactivity was highest in blood, 
myocardium and muscle. In addition lacteal transfer of DTG was evident. 
In conclusion, the non-clinical pharmacokinetic aspects of DTG were thoroughly evaluated during the original 
approval procedure for Tivicay. No new non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies were submitted in support of the 
present application. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of DTG was investigated during the marketing authorisation application of Tivicay. No 
new preclinical toxicology studies have been conducted in support of the present application. This is acceptable. 
In view of the new paediatric indication, the results of the previously conducted reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies, in particular the juvenile toxicity studies are of special interest.

Repeat-dose toxicity  
The toxicity of DTG was investigated in repeat-dose studies in rat up to 26 weeks, in monkey up to 38 weeks, 
and in mouse up to 13 weeks. Adverse effects of DTG were evident in the stomach, cecum, colon and rectum in 
both rat and monkey, but based on systemic exposure as well as dose, monkeys were considerably more 
sensitive to these effects than rats. Concerning the gastrointestinal targets, comparisons based on mg/m2 may 
be more relevant than systemic exposure levels and at the NOAEL multiples were in the range of 2-3x the 
expected human values.  
There were indications of a potential of DTG to disturb liver functional activity in the mouse 3 month study, and 
in the monkey liver effects were reported at doses from 300 mg/kg in the 2 week study with more pronounced 
reactions, including single cell necrosis and hypertrophy at a dose of 1000 mg/kg. The mechanism of liver injury 
in the monkey is not known. An electrophilic metabolite of DTG appears to be formed but it is unclear whether 
this is involved in mechanisms of toxicity identified in non-clinical studies. Some clinical data have indicated a 
potential for liver reactions to DTG.  
Genotoxicity  
Negative results were reported except for a weakly positive result in the mouse lymphoma assay at high 
cytotoxicity. A previous non-GLP mouse lymphoma test was positive at high dose but cytotoxicity may have 
confounded results.  The in vivo rat micronucleus test was negative. Taken together the data did not indicate any 
relevant genotoxic potential of DTG.  
Carcinogenicity 
Long term carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mouse and rat. Overall DTG did not exhibit any significant 
neoplastic activity in either study.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
There were no noteworthy findings with respect to sperm functional parameters and morphology in male rats 
treated with doses of DTG up to 1000 mg/kg. Male and female fertility did not appear to be affected at doses up 
to 1000 mg/kg providing exposure multiples of approximately x27 the expected clinical value at a dose of 50 mg 
BID.

Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
In a pre-and post-natal development study, DOL was administered to rat dams (Crl:CD(SD)) orally at doses of 
5, 50 or 1000 mg/kg/day from Day 6 of gestation (GD) to postnatal day (PND) 20 of lactation.

The F1 generation was evaluated with respect to clinical signs, viability day on PND of lactation, weaning index, 
body weights, physical development (pinna unfolding, growth of hair, eruption the upper incisors and eyelid 
opening) early behaviour (back rightning, negative geotaxis) sensory functions (visual placing response, 
papillary reflex, Preyer’s reflex and pain response), open field test, conditioned avoidance response (shuttle box 
test), genital development (preputial separation and vaginal opening), vaginal smears, mating ability, fertility, 
gross pathology and implantation and viability of embryos (F2) on GD13. Overall, no test-substance related 
adverse effects where discovered in the F0 dams. In the F1 generation, one new-born had external 
malformations (meningocele and eye bulge aplasia) in the 1000 mg/kg/day dose group. Due to overall low 
incidence of developmental anomalies, this defect was considered not to be treatment-related by the Applicant. 
Statistically significant decreases were noted in the body weights of female offspring (F1) in the 1000 mg/kg 
group at PND11, 14, 18, 21, 28, 35 and 42 as compared to the control group. 
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated  
In the first dose range finding (DRF) and tolerability study (CD2009/00409; Table 3), survival, clinical signs, 
body weight, body lengths and toxicokinetics were monitored. The dose range of DOL was between 5 and 1000 
mg/kg/day and administration was by gavage between PND4 and PND21 with endpoint observations on 
PND21-22.

NOAEL F1: 2 mg/kg   
Systemic exposure levels were similar at 100 and 500 mg/kg/day. At doses > 500 mg/kg/day, deaths occurred 
starting on PND14. Macroscopic observations were yellow discoloration of the intestines, liver and skin and small 
adrenals. Growth retardation was noted at 500 mg/kg with decreases in body weight and body length. There 
were no marked differences between male and female offspring for Cmax and AUC at PND21 (Table 4). Cmax 
peaked at the 100 mg/kg/day dose. A 10-fold increase in dose from 5 mg/kg/day corresponded approximately 
to a 2- to 3-fold increase in systemic exposure. A 20-fold increase in dose from 5 mg/kg/day gave a 3- to 4-fold 
increase in systemic exposure.

In the second DRF study (CD2009/00770, Table 5) parameters monitored included survival, clinical signs, body 
weight, in life photographs, gross and histopathology (stomach, liver, spleen, thymus, lymph), clinical 
chemistry, haematology, toxicokinetics and B and T cells via flow cytometry. The dose range was between 2 and 
300 mg/kg/day and applied by gavage between PND4 and PND31 with endpoint observations on PND13, PND21 
and PND32.  
Deaths occurred at 300 mg/kg. Increased rarefaction of hepatocytes at this dose level was probably related to 
increased glycogen and lack of fasting prior to euthanasia in this group. There was a non-dose related decrease 
in peripheral T cells at doses ≥25 mg/kg. The number of B cells was not affected.

No clear differences between males and females could be seen for toxicokinetic parameters on PND13. A 
12.5-fold increase in dose from 2 mg/kg/day corresponded approximately to a 4- to 5-fold increase in systemic 
exposure. A 37.5-fold increase in dose from 2 mg/kg/day led also to an approximately 4- to 5-fold increase in 
systemic exposure.

In the third, pivotal, juvenile toxicity study (CD2010/00023, Table 6), the endpoints were body weight, food 
intake, physical development (vaginal opening, balano-preputial skin fold separation), haematology, 
coagulation, urinalysis, gross and histopathology, stage-dependent evaluation of spermatogenesis, organ 
weights, femur length and T cell dependent antibody response and immune-phenotyping of lymphocyte subsets 
and CD4 or CD8 T cell receptor V beta usage. The doses used were 0.5, 2 and 75 mg/kg/day and they were 
applied by gavage between PND4 and PND66 with toxicokinetic endpoint observations on PND13 and PND32, 
clinical observations on PND21, PND28 and PND66 and 67, and terminal body weight and necropsy on PND67. 
The offspring was gradually weaned from maternal removal on PND21 (2 to 3 animals per sex and box) to 
individual housing on PND28 (1 animal per sex and box). 
Two pre-weaning male pup deaths occurred on PND12 and PND17 in the 75 mg/kg/day dose group and were 
considered test-substance linked. Nasal degeneration was observed at all dose levels, being ascribed to a local 
irritant effect. For the 75 mg/kg/day dose, an body weight reduction induced during pre-weaning occurred in 
both sexes but was transient in male offspring (having recovered compared to controls between PND28 and 
PND42) while females did not recover before the termination of the experiment (mean female body weight on 
PND66 was 257g compared to a control mean value of 282g).  No effects on immunological competence or on 
lymphocyte subsets counts were reported. NOAEL was set at 2 mg/kg, corresponding to a Cmax of 15.8 µg/ml 
(Male 15.2 + female 16.4 / 2) and an AUC0-24 of 309.5 µg x h/ml (male 303 + female 316 / 2) at PND 13 (Table 
6). Corresponding levels on day 32 were Cmax 7.585 µg/ml (male 7.71 + female 7.46 / 2) and AUC0-24 89.5 µg 
x h/ml (male 85.7 + female 93.3 / 2). No apparent gender differences could be seen at the NOAEL and the 
LOAEL.

The estimated therapeutic target exposure in human children for AUC0-24 is 46 µg x h/ml, with an acceptable 
systemic exposure range between a lower limit of 37 µg x h/ml and a upper limit of 67 µg x h/ml (The maximal 
lower limit is estimated to 25 µg x h/ml and the upper maximal limit is 92 µg x h/ml). Based on the pre-weaning 
values from PND13 (, this gives an AUC-based dosing marginal of: 
•  NOAEL (2 mg/kg/day) : 8.4x (lower limit) and 4.6x (upper limit) 
• 
LOAEL (75 mg/kg/day) : 41.7x (lower limit) and 23.1x (upper limit)  
Based on the post-weaning values from PND32, this gives an AUC-based dosing marginal of: 
•  NOAEL (2 mg/kg/day) : 2.4x (lower limit) and 1.3x (upper limit) 
• 
LOAEL (75 mg/kg/day) : 26.5x (lower limit) and 14.6x (upper limit)  
The Applicant presented two main arguments why the observed pre-weaning deaths in male pups, as well as the 
body weight reduction in both sexes during the pre-weaning period, should not constitute a safety concern for 
6-year old children. It could be concluded that that the pre-weaning deaths and negative effect on body weight 
gain at 75 mg/kg/day in the pivotal juvenile rat study are not of concern for children 6 years of age. The results 
and conclusions are reflected in the SmPC. If there would be a future indication in children < 6 years, these data 
will required a careful re-evaluation, especially in light of the low margins to NOAEL (4.6-8.4-fold for PND13 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/601663/20177 
Page 18/54 
  
  
 
1.3-2.4-fold for PND32). The Applicant may, in that case, consider conducting a new study using 1-2 
intermediate dose groups between 2 and 75 mg/kg, to further establish the NOAEL. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No new environmental information has been introduced in the present Tivicay submission and the ERA is 
therefore conducted on the previously submitted data. Based on the information, DTG is not classified as a PBT 
or vPvB compounds and is most likely to accumulate in STP sludge and sediment. Overall, DTG is found to be 
able to generate toxicity in both aquatic ecosystems (algae toxicity) and terrestrial ecosystems (phytotoxicity in 
pea). While not remarked upon in the original submission ERA, a potent and clear deviation in soil 
micro-organism nitrate formation was also detected subsequent to DTG exposure. The biological significance of 
this effect is unclear. As this effect is stimulatory rather than inhibitory (specified in the OECD TG216) this 
finding will not influence the present ERA.  
In the original application for DTG’s use in adults and juveniles, the overall conclusion was that DTG is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. While acknowledging the general increase (a near doubling of HIV 
diagnoses during the last decade in different regions of Europe, see ECDC-WHO report for HIV/AIDS surveillance 
in Europe 2014) it is deemed unlikely to that the new target population (6-12 years of age) strongly influences 
the size of the overall patient population and consequently the eco-toxicological calculations (and dependent 
conclusions) from the original application. 
In summary, as with the original submission, DTG is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicological or eco-toxicological studies were submitted 
in support of the present application. This is acceptable. The Applicant has provided a thorough discussion 
concerning the adverse findings in the juvenile rat toxicity studies. As stated above, it is agreed that the 
pre-weaning deaths and negative effect on body weight gain at 75 mg/kg/day in the pivotal juvenile rat study 
are not of concern for children 6 years of age. 
With regard to the ERA, DTG is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. That being said, it can be noted 
that the Applicant calculates the surface water PEC based on sales prediction market penetration forecast 
(sp-Fpen) based on the whole EU population. As there are regional differences in HIV infection prevalence in the 
European Union (e.g. between eastern and western Europe), these Fpen-dependent values are misleading. 
These regional differences were also made clear in the scientific advice for the original submission (the 2nd 
follow-up) given in 2011 which demonstrated a WHO/ECDC-specified member-state range in HIV/AIDS 
prevalence between 0.1% (e.g. Germany) and 1.2% (Estonia) with most member states reporting an incidence 
<1%.  
The Applicant committed to recalculate and correct the Fpen (for the member state with the highest HIV 
prevalence) and all associated parameters at the first opportune moment and/or future renewal of the ERA. In 
a similar manner, regarding the Phase IIB assessment of sediment-dweller toxicity, the Applicant committed to 
recalculate the NOECSED into a standardized NOECSED with an organic carbon content of 10% (and all 
downstream dependent parameters) at the first opportune moment and/or renewal of the ERA. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that here is no objection to approval of Tivicay from a non-clinical point of view.

The extension of indication of Tivicay is supported by PK and clinical efficacy/safety data derived from study 
ING112578 (P1093). This is an ongoing Phase I/II multi-centre, open-label non-comparative study with a 
targeted enrolment of approximately 160 HIV-1 infected infants, children, and adolescents ages ≥4 weeks to 
<18 years in age-defined cohorts sequentially from oldest to youngest: 
•  Cohort I: Adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age (tablet formulation) 
•  Cohort IIA: Children ≥6 to <12 years of age (tablet formulation) 
•  Cohort IIB: Children ≥6 to <12 years of age (granules for oral suspension) 
•  Cohort III: Children ≥2 to <6 years of age (granules for oral suspension) 
•  Cohort IV: Children ≥6 months to <2 years (granules for oral suspension) 
•  Cohort V: Infants ≥4 weeks to <6 months (granules for oral suspension) 
The submitted data include: 
• 
PK, efficacy and safety results from Cohort I (≥12 to <18 years – Week 48 results) and Cohort IIA (≥6 
to <12 years – Week 24 efficacy results), 
Assessment report

•  A population PK (POPPK) analysis from Cohort I and Cohort IIA, and preliminary data from Cohort IIB. 
Subjects of Cohorts I and IIA of study P1093 received oral tablets of dolutegravir (10 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg). 
Clinical data from Cohorts IIB, III, IV and V (with the oral suspension of dolutegravir) are not available at this 
stage and therefore not included in this application. 
During the evaluation, the MAH confirmed that the development of oral suspension has been stopped and is 
replaced by the development of dispersible tablets. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The recommended adult dose of DTG is 50 mg once daily in patients infected with HIV-1 without resistance to 
the integrase class. In patients infected with HIV-1 with resistance to the integrase class the recommended dose 
of DTG is 50 mg twice daily. DTG is currently approved in adolescences (12 years or older and weighing at least 
40 kg), infected with HIV-1 without resistance to the integrase class. The recommended dose of DTG in 
adolescences is 50 mg once daily. 
Data from the two first cohorts (I, ≥12 to <18 years, and IIa, ≥6 to <12 years) from an on-going paediatric 
study (P1093 also named ING112578), provided new data (cohort IIA) on DTG in a total of 23 children between 
the ages of 6 to 12 years. Efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic data, as well as modelling and simulation data 
are being used to support the proposed paediatric dosing strategy to expand the paediatric indication for DTG to 
include patients 6 to 12 years of age.  
Analytical methods 
Human plasma samples were analyzed for DTG concentration using a validated analytical method based on 
protein precipitation, followed by HPLC/MS/MS analysis. The lower limit of quantification (LLQ) for DTG was 5 
ng/mL with a higher limit of quantification (HLQ) of 10000 ng/mL. Linear regression analysis calculations were 
performed using MultiQuant 2.0.2. 
A summary of the bioanalytical method used for the study ING112578 is given in Table 8.

Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using both non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and 
population PK analysis. WinNonlin version 5.3 or Phoenix 6.4 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA) was 
used for all NCA pharmacokinetic analyses. NONMEM® program version VII level 3.0 was used for the 
population PK analysis (ICON, Ellicott City, Maryland, USA). PK parameters were estimated using the first-order 
conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI). 
ADME properties 
ADME studies have only been performed in adults. The absolute bioavailability of dolutegravir has not been 
established. Food has an influence on the bioavailability of dolutegravir and depends on meal content: low, 
moderate, and high fat meals increased dolutegravir AUC(0-∞) by 33%, 41%, and 66%, increased Cmax by 46%, 
52%, and 67%, prolonged Tmax to 3, 4, and 5 hours from 2 hours under fasted conditions, respectively. 
Dolutegravir is highly bound (>99%) to human plasma proteins. In adults the terminal half-life was ~14 hours 
and the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was approximately 1 L/hr in HIV-infected patients based on a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. The intra- and inter-individual variability in exposure to DTG in adult patients was low 
to moderate (20-39% (%CV) for CL/F). 
Renal elimination of unchanged active substance is low (<1% of the dose). Fifty-three percent of total oral dose 
is excreted unchanged in the faeces. It is unknown if all or part of this is due to unabsorbed active substance or 
biliary excretion of the glucuronide conjugate, which can be further degraded to form the parent compound in 
the gut lumen. Thirty-two percent of the total oral dose is excreted in the urine. 
Dolutegravir is primarily metabolized through glucuronidation via UGT1A1 with a minor CYP3A component. 
Dolutegravir is the predominant circulating compound in plasma. Metabolites found in the urine are ether 
glucuronide of dolutegravir (18.9% of total dose), N-dealkylation metabolite (3.6% of total dose), and a 
metabolite formed by oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose). 
Bioequivalence  
No new bioequivalence or relative bioavailability data was provided for the new 10 and 25 mg tablet strengths.  
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
In adults there is dose-proportional increase in exposure between 25 mg and 50 mg tablets while the increase 
is less than proportional between 50 mg and 100 mg, due to limitations in solubility. No time dependency in PK 
has been observed. 
Interactions 
Effects of other medicinal products on the PK of DTG 
DTG is a substrate of UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 as well as of the transporter proteins P-pg and BCRP. No mechanistic 
studies aimed to investigate the relative importance of the elimination pathways have been performed, however 
a number of co-medications commonly used in clinical practice have been studied. The effects of selected 
co-administered drugs on the PK of DTG are given in Figure 3.

Effects of DTG on the PK of other drugs  
The risk of clinically relevant DDIs due to inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 or general 
enzyme/transporter induction by DTG is considered low. For CYP3A4 clinically relevant DDIs due to inhibition or 
induction by DTG at systemic level are considered to be low.  
DTG did not inhibit BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, MRP4, MATE1, MATE2-K, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1 and P-pg in vitro to 
any clinically relevant extent. DTG inhibited OCT2 in vitro, which is supported by the in vivo observation of a 
decrease in creatinine clearance. DTG inhibited OAT1 and OAT3 in vitro. In vivo, OAT1 (tenofovir as substrate) 
was not inhibited by DTG. OAT3 has not been studied in vivo and DTG may increase exposure of OAT3 
substrates.  
Special populations  
No dose adjustment is required in in subjects with renal or mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Severe HI has 
not been studied.  
Gender, race and elderly population had no clinically relevant effects on the PK of DTG. PK in adolescents 12 to 
18 years of age was similar to adults.

Previously in adults, the exposure was found to decrease with increasing body weight. For the range of weights 
in the treatment-naïve population (39-135 kg), CL/F ranged from 0.67-1.2 L/h which was 23% lower to 33% 
higher compared to a 70-kg subject, and V/F ranged from 11-29 L which was 36% lower to 66% higher 
compared to a 70-kg subject. A similar result was obtained in the analysis of treatment-experienced patients. 
The predicted exposure is approximately 25% higher for low weight patients (40 kg) and 25% lower for high 
weight patients (135 kg) compared to a 70 kg reference patient. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population  
The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir has been determined previously in adult and adolescent (≥12 to <18 
years of age) HIV 1 infected patients. The exposure in adults was previously found to be related to body weight, 
but not considered to be clinically relevant in adults. The paediatric study P1093/ING112578 was included in the 
original submission, but only data from the first cohort (12-18 years) was available. A clear relation between oral 
clearance and body weight was not observed in the adolescent PK and it was at the time of approval concluded 
that more data from children with lower body weight was needed before any conclusion could be drawn. The 
study is ongoing with sequential inclusion of cohorts from higher to lower age.  
The PK data generated in the paediatric study originates from both frequent PK sampling (Table 9) as well as 
sparse sampling. Consequently, population PK modelling is employed in order to describe the PK profile 
regardless of sampling schedule and to determine factors that influence exposure. Information regarding 
included subjects in population PK and baseline demographics is given in Tables 10 and 11. In total 18 subjects 
aged between 6 and <12 years was included in the initial popPK analysis. 
An additional 47 DTG concentrations from 11 subjects (all Cohort IIA) that were not available at the time of the 
initial Pop PK model was developed were included during the procedure based on a request from the CHMP. A 
further 5 additional DTG concentrations from 1 subject (Cohort IIB) became available during the late stage of 
the current analysis and was used to update the final model parameters. 
Pharmacokinetic data from administration of the granule formulation was included in the popPK analysis, but 
was specifically assessed since this formulation was not a part of the current application.

Results of PopPK analysis 
The PK of dolutegravir following oral administration of tablets and granules was described by a 
one-compartment model with first order absorption, absorption lag time and first-order elimination; absorption 
rate constant, absorption lag time, and relative bioavailability were formulation-specific. Body weight was found 
to be a covariate on both clearance and volume of distribution of the central compartment. Model-estimated

Simulations of the recommended doses for children 6-12 years (15 to >40 kg) 
Simulations using Monte-Carlo approach were performed to evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed 
dolutegravir (DTG) dosing regimen. DTG concentrations were predicted at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h following 
steady-state once-daily doses of DTG. 
The percentage of children below the 10th percentile of adult concentration was 12% and 18% in the ≥40 kg and 
15 to <20 kg weight group, respectively. However, the central tendency in exposure was similar to the adult 
exposure, but the variability greater leading to both higher and lower exposure in children compared to adults.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dolutegravir is a HIV integrase inhibitor (INI). INIs are a newer class of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs designed to 
block the action of the integrase (IN) viral enzyme, which catalyses two key steps in the HIV life cycle and is 
responsible for insertion of the viral genome into the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the host cell. Since genome 
integration is a vital step in retroviral replication, it is an attractive target for HIV therapy. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The viral replication cycle involves integration of the viral genome into host cell chromatin in two separate steps; 
3’ processing and strand transfer. During 3’ processing a dinucleotide is excised by integrase from the 3’ 
terminus of viral cDNA. The 3’ processed viral DNA is then covalently linked to host DNA during strand transfer. 
Since integrase inhibitors appear to act at later stages of the viral replication cycle than viral entry or reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors, a larger proportion of productively infected cells may be inhibited. Dolutegravir has 
been shown to inhibit the strand transfer reaction, demonstrated as an accumulation of 2-long terminal repeat 
(2-LTR) circles at nanomolar concentrations. Dolutegravir has shown activity against most clones resistant to 
raltegravir and elvitegravir. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The applicant argues as following concerning PK targets for dose selection: 
Since paediatric PK tends to be more variable than adults, a lower threshold range for both the AUC24 and C24h 
was identified. Using maximum effect (Emax) models, the estimated AUC24 required to produce 95% of the 
maximum virologic response (i.e., the 95% effective concentration [EC95]) is 25 µg*h/mL, and the EC95 for the 
C24h is 0.5 µg/ml. Therefore, all subjects had to meet these minimum exposure targets. These were considered 
the lowest threshold exposures acceptable in the paediatric study. This lower threshold is in place to ensure 
minimum exposure criteria are met, for some reason the targeted range cannot be met in an individual using the 
selected dose for the population. Similarly, the maximal exposure (upper threshold) is also defined to ensure 
subjects are not exposed to extremely high drug concentrations which may cause safety concerns.  
Based on accumulated data in adults (in Phase I and IIb) to date, DTG is generally well tolerated with no 
significant safety issues identified. A dose of DTG 50 mg twice daily (BID) was evaluated in studies ING112961 
(VIKING) and ING112574 (VIKING-3) in adult, HIV-infected subjects with resistance to RAL; exposures up to 
2-fold higher are expected with co-administration of ATV with DTG, which is allowed in adult Phase III studies.  
Therefore, the maximal exposure target is 92 µg*h/mL for AUC24, which is 2 times the geometric mean (GM) 
value at 50 mg once daily in adults (46 µg*h/mL) and is comparable to exposures anticipated with 50 mg BID 
or co-administration of DTG 50 mg once daily with ATV. Such upper thresholds may be adjusted upon availability 
of further clinical data. A dose-limiting toxicity has not been identified to date. 
The 50 mg adult dose AUC24 target value is 46 µg*h/mL and the C24h is 0.96 µg/mL, which represent geometric 
means. However, there will be variability around these targets. Therefore, the target range was defined as 
follows:  the lower limits are 80% of the geometric means (37 µg*h/mL for AUC24 and 0.77 µg/mL for C24h); the 
upper limits are the 90th percentiles around the AUC24 and C24h (67 µg*h/mL for AUC24 and 2.26 µg/mL for 
C24h) observed in adult subjects in ING112276 (SPRING-1).  
Assessment report  
EMA/601663/20177 
Page 29/54 
  
  
In summary, the target exposure for AUC24 was set to 46 µg*h/mL, targeting average adult exposure, with an 
acceptable range of 37-67 µg*h/mL.  The target exposure for C24h was 960 ng/mL with an acceptable range of 
770-2260 ng/mL.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
ADME 
No new data on general pharmacokinetic properties has been submitted. All ADME studies have only been 
performed in adults. Given the nature of this application, this is considered acceptable.  
Formulation 
No new bioequivalence or relative bioavailability data for the new tablet strengths 10 and 25 mg was provided 
in the present submission. A major objection was raised related to a lack of sufficient PK characterisation of the 
new tablet strengths 10 and 25 mg. Furthermore, an in vivo relative bioavailability study in adults comparing the 
exposure of the 10, 25 and 50 mg tablets was requested unless otherwise justified by the Applicant. The 
Applicant stated that a relative bioavailability in adults study comparing the different tablet strengths is not 
necessary. The main reason for this would be that the new tablet strengths are sufficiently studied in the present 
paediatric study (ING112578) and also that there is no intent to interchange the tablet strengths. Furthermore, 
the Applicant states that bioavailability of the formulations will not be similar in paediatric subjects as compared 
to adults because of differences in clearance by body weight in paediatric subjects. However, the most common 
way forward for development of paediatric formulation is to perform a formulation study in adults which then is 
extrapolated to paediatric population, even though the absolute BA might differ, the relative BA should be 
possible to extrapolate to children in age range 6-12 years. 
The 25 mg tablet is considered sufficiently characterised for the intended use in children. This is based on the 
combined in vivo data in adults and paediatrics in addition to in vitro dissolution data and is therefore approvable. 
The Applicant refers to a previously submitted study (SPRING 1/ING112276) where steady state PK data from 
10 mg and 25 mg tablets was investigated in adults. In this study the dose-normalised  AUCTAU  and CTAU  were 
comparable for 25 mg and 50 mg. The 25 mg tablet used in SPRING1/ING112276 was of a different composition 
compared to the paediatric study ING112578; however it was shown to be bioequivalent to the 25 mg tablet 
composition used in the paediatric study in PK study submitted in the original marketing authorisation (study 
ING113674). The 25 mg tablet intended for market was administered in the paediatric study ING112578 in 7 
subjects (weight range 20-30 kg), where intensive PK sampling was available in 4 subjects and sparse in 
remaining 3. The mean exposure obtained from non-compartmental analysis of rich PK data in subjects 
receiving the 25 mg dose was lower compared to the mean exposure after a 50 mg dose. However, the overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/601663/20177 
Page 30/54 
  
  
 
variability in exposure is substantial and individuals with even lower exposure are observed in the group treated 
with the 50 mg tablet. This means that a mean value calculated separately for a small sample of subjects is 
associated with a large uncertainty. However, the composition of the 25 mg tablet is proportional to the 
approved 50 mg tablet and the in vitro dissolution profiles are generally considered similar to the approved 50 
mg tablet (see quality). Thus the 25 mg tablet is considered sufficiently characterised based on the combined in 
vivo data in adult and paediatric patients in addition to in vitro dissolution data and is therefore approvable.  
Regarding the 10 mg tablet, the composition is not proportional to the 50 mg tablet and also behaves differently 
compared to the 50 mg tablet in the in vitro dissolution assay (see section on quality). As stated above the 
number of paediatric subjects in the present clinical study receiving the 10 mg tablet where exposure data is 
available is notably low. However, as response to Day 120 List of Questions from the CHMP the Applicant 
submitted additional PK data from 15 subjects that received the 10 mg tablet, either alone (n=4) or in 
combination with the 25 mg tablet (n=11). The new data were in line with previous PK observations and 
considered supportive of the paediatric PopPK model for dolutegravir. 
The 10 mg tablet is considered to be sufficiently characterized for its purpose, i.e. the 10 mg tablet can only be 
used as the posology given in SmPC section 4.2 Table 1. It is reflected in Section 4.2 of the SmPC that the 10 mg 
table is not interchangeable. 
Interactions 
Dolutegravir is primarily metabolized through glucuronidation via UGT1A1 with a minor CYP3A component. Both 
UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 enzyme activities are low at birth. CYP3A4 is expected to be fully mature at 6 years of age 
and approximate the adult activity at 6 months (Johnson et al Clin. Pharmacokinetics 2006; 45 (9): 931-956). 
There is less data on maturation of UGT1A1, but it known to rapidly increase to adult activity. UGT1A1 activity 
will be further discussed when data from younger aged groups will be submitted.  No new interaction studies 
have been performed. The SmPC contains extensive information on the DDI potential of DTG from the initial 
application. There is no proposed change in SmPC Section 4.5, except for the dosing recommendation when DTG 
is co-administrated with inducers (Etravirine, Efavirenz, Nevirapine, Tipranavir/r, Carbamazepine, 
Oxcarbazepine/Phenytoin/Phenobarbital, St John’s wort and Rifampicin). The applicant proposed that the 
paediatric daily dose should be administered twice daily, in line with the adult recommendation. Dolutegravir is 
primarily metabolized through glucuronidation via UGT1A1 with a minor CYP3A and both enzymes are mature at 
age of 6 years according to the Applicant, which is agreed. The popPK analysis included inducers (categorised as 
mild and moderate/strong) as a covariate, but was not found significant. DTG is also a P-pg and BCRP substrate 
and the Applicant was asked to discuss the maturation of these. The Applicant has provided literature data 
supporting that there are no overt differences in BCRP and P-gp expression in the 6-12 year age group compared 
to adults and thus extrapolation of adult DDI results to the 6 to 12 year age group is adequate.  
PopPK analysis  
The PK data generated in the paediatric study results from both frequent PK sampling as well as sparse 
sampling. Consequently, population PK modelling is employed in order to describe the PK profile regardless of 
sampling schedule and to determine factors that influence exposure. 
The population PK model is pivotal in this application. It is used to support the dosing regimen by simulations. 
The model contributes with quantification of the risk of over/under exposure and provides evidence for weight 
based dosing. The optimal dose levels and weight bands may be deduced from the model by simulation of 
exposure in the target population. However, in order to trust the model it needs to be qualified for its purpose.

The response from the Applicant was lacking important information and additional questions were raised 
regarding:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
importance that the relation between clearance and body weight is well defined, 
that the between- and within subject variability in model parameters is accounted for 
that influence of study design is accounted for in the model (e.g. rich/sparse sampling as covariate in the 
residual error model). 
The absorption phase should be properly described in order to regard the disposition parameters, and 
ultimately the predicted Ctau, as unbiased by the absorption model. 
It is assumed in the model that the eliminating capacity is related to body weight to the power of ¾ according 
to allometry. The allometric exponents were evaluated in the original modelling analysis. Estimated values were 
relatively close to theoretical (0.68 vs 0.75 and 0.952 vs 1, for CL and V respectively) and therefore they were 
fixed. This was later confirmed by the Applicant’s additional modelling. 
Several alternative models including a more flexible absorption model and alternative handling of 
intra-individual variability was explored by the Applicant. None of the models provided a better fit to the data 
and it was concluded that the original updated PopPK model was sufficient to describe data. 
To summarize, the Applicant has shown that alternative models does not describe the data better than the 
current model. The model still seems to over predict variability but is in general acceptable for description of the 
data and simulation of exposure within the range of studied doses and range of body weight. To improve the 
precision in modelling for the remaining parts of the P1093 study, the CHMP recommended performing a relative 
bioavailability study to compare the 10 mg and the dispersible dolutegravir tablet formulations, to the 50 mg 
tablet. The MAH committed to perform this study.  
Posology 
During the procedure the applicant was requested to substantiate the dosing regimen including weight bands, or 
consider an alternative posology to provide an adequate exposure. The Applicant provided simulations of an 
alternative posology excluding the 10 mg tablet strength, making use only of the 25 mg and 50 mg strengths. 
The Applicant chose to simulate using a WHO standard for weight category (14 to <20 kg, 20 to <25 kg, 25 to 
<35 kg and >35 kg). As expected, the exposure was considerably higher for subjects where the greatest 
increase in dose was seen. The alternative posology would lead to some subjects experiencing exposure well 
above what has been observed in adults at a dose level of 50 mg bid. Although the risk of under exposure would 
be somewhat reduced, the consequences of over exposure in children are not known and the alternative 
posology could not be recommended. 
Similarly, the original dose levels were applied to the WHO weight categories. Compared to the original dosing 
regimen, a larger proportion of subjects would have an exposure above the 90th percentile of adult data while 
approximately the same proportion would run the risk of having a Ctau below the 10th percentile of adult data.

Table 17.  Simulated steady-state dolutegravir exposures using alternative posologies 
1PK parameters at 10th and 90th percentiles of adults at 50mg daily dose were post hoc estimates derived from the Pop PK model based on HIV-1 infected 
treatment-experienced adults. The 10th and 90th percentiles were 0.323 and 2.07μg/mL for Cτ, and 26.7 and 75.1 μg∙hr/mL for AUC0-τ, respectively. 
The Population model used in simulation mode is considered to provide conservative estimates of over 
exposure. This is partly due to that correlation between variability parameters cannot always be estimated. 
Simulating without correlated parameters may lead to inflation of the variability in exposure and therefore the 
simulations may be considered conservative with respect to fraction of subjects outside the predefined exposure 
limits. It is agreed that the original (studied) posology is likely to provide safe and efficacious exposure in 
children above 6 years of age. 
To conclude, the alternative posologies that have been considered do not appear to be better in terms of efficacy 
or safety compared to the original posology.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The 10 mg tablet is considered to be sufficiently characterised with regards to PK. The updated population PK 
model adequately describes the data from the paediatric subjects included in this application. The proposed 
posology is anticipated to exposures reasonably similar to those seen in adults treated with 50mg/d, and is 
acceptable given the presumed broad therapeutic index of dolutegravir. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The current application is based on one ongoing paediatric study (P1093/ING112578) to support the extended 
therapeutic indication in children 6-12 years.  The study is being conducted by an academic research 
organization IMPAACT under the sponsorship of DAIDS. 
2.5.1.  Dose response and main study 
Study P1093 (ING112578) – Study title: P1093 - Phase I/II, Multi-Center, Open-Label Pharmacokinetic, 
Safety, Tolerability and Antiviral Activity of GSK1349572, a Novel Integrase Inhibitor, in Combination Regimens 
in HIV-1 Infected Infants, Children and Adolescents 
This is an ongoing Phase I/II multi-center, open-label, non-comparative study of with an inclusion target of 
approximately 160 HIV-1-infected paediatric subjects ages ≥4 weeks to <18 years (enrolled sequentially in 
age-defined cohorts), to evaluate the PK parameters, safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of DTG when 
administered both prior to starting, and in combination with optimized background therapy (OBT). 
The current application is based on data from two sub-cohorts of the P1093 study: Cohort IIA containing 
children 6-12 years, which is the scope of the current application, and Cohort I containing adolescents 12-18 
years and are considered supportive to the current application. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Key inclusion criteria include antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced, INI-naïve infants, children, and 
adolescents age ≥4 weeks to <18 years at study entry, with confirmed HIV-1 infection, and an optimized 
background regimen that contains at least one fully active drug. 
Key exclusion criteria include known resistance to an integrase inhibitor, presence of any active AIDS-defining 
opportunistic infections, known ≥Grade 3 and Grade 4 lab toxicities, evidence of pancreatitis, liver toxicity, and 
known exposure to an integrase inhibitor. 
There are five age-defined groups in P1093 (enrolled in six cohorts) as follows:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Cohort I: Adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age (tablet formulation) 
Cohort IIA: Children ≥6 to <12 years of age (tablet formulation)  
Cohort IIB: Children ≥6 to <12 years of age (paediatric formulation) 
Cohort III: Children ≥2 to <6 years of age (paediatric formulation) 
Cohort IV: Children ≥6 months to <2 years (paediatric formulation) 
Cohort V: Infants ≥4 weeks to <6 months (paediatric formulation)

Seven investigators in the US and 1 investigator in Thailand enrolled all subjects in Cohort I. Eleven 
investigators in the US, 2 investigators in Thailand, and 1 investigator in South Africa enrolled all subjects in 
Cohort IIA. The first subject enrolled in Cohort I on 20 Apr 2011. 
Paediatric subjects in Cohorts I and IIA receive DTG tablets (10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg) once daily according to 
weight-based dosages, whereas those in Cohorts IIB through V receive the paediatric formulation. 
Each age cohort consists of two sequential stages: Stage I and II. The objectives of Stage I were to examine PK 
parameters after intense sampling and evaluate the short term tolerability and safety of DTG in approximately 
10 subjects, allowing the selection of a dose for further study in Stage II. Those enrolled into Stage I remain in 
Stage I for the duration of the study. Longer-term safety and antiviral activity of DTG will be assessed from data 
obtained from those enrolled in Stage I as well as those in Stage II who initiated treatment at the chosen dose 
for the cohort and remained on this dose. Subjects in Stage I or Stage II will progress to the Long Term Safety 
Follow-up once 48 weeks of drug is completed and if they are deriving benefit from the study drug. 
Treatments 
For those subjects enrolling in Stage I, DTG treatment was added to a stable, failing ARV regimen or started as 
monotherapy for those not taking ARVs. Intensive PK was performed between Days 5 to 10; after obtaining the 
24-hour PK sample, the background ARV regimen was immediately optimized. To minimize the impact of 
drug-drug interactions on PK variability, the use of ATV, nevirapine (NVP), ATV/RTV, EFV, fosamprenavir (FPV), 
FPV/RTV, and tipranavir (TPV), TPV/RTV was not allowed prior to the initial PK evaluation but could be added as 
part of optimized background therapy. All ARV regimens must have contained at least one fully active drug and 
one additional drug in the OBT, in addition to DTG. An initial starting DTG dose was approximately 1 mg/kg once 
daily, with a maximum daily dose of 50 mg.

All subjects in both Cohort I and Cohort IIA were treated exclusively at the final selected dose. The treatment 
dosing regimen assignments used in this study were based on DTG tablet once daily doses, with target dose of 
~1 mg/kg across 4 weight bands, and maximum dose of 50 mg. Note, for subjects receiving concomitant 
rifampin, EFV, FPV/RTV, or TPV/RTV, it was recommended that the dose of DTG be increased to twice-daily 
administration.  
The treatment dosing assignments used in Cohort I and Cohort IIA were: 
-  Cohort I: 19 subjects received 50 mg/day and 4 subjects received 35 mg/day. 
-  Cohort IIA: 1 subject received 70 mg/day (taken as 35 mg BID), 5 subjects received 50 mg/day, 6 
subjects received 35 mg/day, 8 subjects received 25 mg/day and 3 subjects received 20 mg/day.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments included monitoring and recording all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory 
parameters including haematology, fasting lipid profile, and blood chemistry. Toxicity through Week 24 was a 
primary endpoint and included all AEs or laboratory toxicities of Grade 3 or higher severity, AEs or laboratory 
toxicities of Grade 3 or higher judged to be at least possibly attributable to the study medication, termination 
from treatment due to a suspected adverse drug reaction (SADR) and Death. 
Efficacy Assessment 
Key secondary efficacy analyses include virologic outcomes based on HIV-1 RNA (c/mL) at Week 24 and Week 
48. At both of these time points, the primary definition of virologic outcome was calculated according to a 
Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF) algorithm – as codified by the FDA’s snapshot algorithm. 
Subjects were classified as virologic failures if they had missing HIV-1 RNA data throughout the window 
surrounding the time point of interest. 
Assessment report  
EMA/601663/20177 
Page 36/54 
  
  
Sample size 
The enrolment estimate assumes an approximate 35% dropout rate, and allows for a minimum of 100 evaluable 
subjects with at least 24 weeks of safety data for those treated exclusively with the selected dose. 
Randomisation 
This was an open-label single-arm study; hence no randomisation or blinding was performed. 
Statistical methods 
Safety Analyses 
It is stated that the primary population for the safety analyses is the all-treated (AT) Population. However, it is 
also stated that the primary safety analysis includes only subjects whose starting doses have been those judged 
to be optimal for their groups. Stage I subjects whose doses have been adjusted for inadequate PK are excluded. 
Stage I subjects who have been removed from treatment due to toxicities while on the optimal dose will be 
included and treated as safety failures in the primary safety analysis. 
AEs were summarized overall and by treatment group: all AEs, AEs by grade, Grade 3 or greater drug-related 
AEs, fatal and non-fatal Grade 3 or greater SAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal. SAEs were summarized 
on-therapy. Mean values and changes from Baseline for laboratory values and vital signs (including height and 
weight) were also summarized.  
Efficacy Analyses 
The all-treated (AT) population was the primary population of interest for all efficacy endpoints and was defined 
as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. 
Key secondary analyses included virologic outcomes, based on HIV-1 RNA (c/mL), assessed at Weeks 24 and 
48. At both of these time points, the primary definition of virologic outcome will be calculated according to the 
MSDF algorithm – as codified by the FDA’s snapshot algorithm. Subjects will be classified as virologic failures if 
they have missing HIV-1 RNA data throughout the window surrounding the time point of interest.  
Results 
Recruitment 
At this time P1093 is ongoing; results presented throughout this clinical study report include Cohort I Stage I 
and Stage II through Week 48 and Cohort IIA Stage I and Stage II through Week 24, both with a data cut-off 
date of 14 February 2015. The first subject in Cohort I was enrolled 20 April 2011; the first subject in Cohort IIA 
was enrolled 25 January 2012.  
A total of 23 subjects from South Africa (n = 4), Thailand (n = 3), and the US (n = 16) were enrolled in Cohort 
IIA (Stage I, n = 11; Stage II, n = 12) and received dolutegravir. Twenty-two subjects completed Week 24 and 
16 subjects have completed Week 48.

In Cohort IIA, the rate of virologic success at 24 weeks (61% when defined as <50 c/mL) is lower than what is 
seen in ART experienced adults treated with dolutegravir (79 % in the SAILING study at 24 weeks). In both 
cohorts, there was an increase in absolute and relative CD4 count. 
Protocol defined virologic failure (PDVF) was defined as a confirmed decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA of <1.0 
log10 c/mL at or after Week 12 unless the HIV RNA is ≤400 c/mL, or a confirmed HIV-1 RNA > 400 c/mL starting 
at Week 24 or beyond on two consecutive measurements at least 1 week but no more than 4 weeks apart.  
-  Cohort I: Six (26%) subjects met PDVF criteria (had confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA >400 c/mL) through 
Week 48, 4 of whom had met PDVF criteria at Week 24; 2 additional subjects met PDVF subsequent to 
Week 48 (at Week 96 and at Week 156). 
-  Cohort IIA: Three (13%) subjects met PDVF criteria (confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA >400 c/mL) at Week 
24; 1 additional subject met PDVF subsequent to Week 24 (at Week 32). 
Evidence of treatment-emergent resistance to a PI, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), or 
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) was seen in a few subjects. 
One subject (Cohort I) had emergent protease (PR) minor mutations M36I and L89M at Week 48 and a reverse 
transcriptase (RT) major mutation, K103N, detected later at Week 96. Concomitant ART records indicate no use 
of an NNRTI for this subject while on study.  
Two additional subjects (one in Cohort I and Cohort IIA each) had emergent minor ART resistance-associated 
mutations to either a PI or NRTI.  
One subject (Cohort I) had treatment-emergent IN resistance at both the initial virologic failure visit (Week 32) 
and at a subsequent virologic failure visit (Week 132) with lack of adherence to study treatment reported 
throughout her participation. At Week 32, population integrase genotyping showed the presence of mutation 
R263R/K and a DTG FC of 1.2. At Week 132, IN mutations E138 A/E/K/T, S147S/G, and R263K were detected 
with a DTG fold change (FC) of 5.1. A clonal analysis was performed at the pre-treatment, Week 32, and Week 
132 time points to better understand the IN resistance acquisition in this subject (Table 13). Results indicated at 
Week 32 the viral population was composed of approximately 50% mutant R263K and that this mutation led to 
the slight increase in median DTG FC (DTG FC=2). The clonal analysis at Week 132, showed the majority of the 
viral population harbouring R263K. In addition, a new emerging minor population with linked IN mutations at 
positions 138, 147, and 263 were seen. When present, these linked mutations resulted in a median DTG FC of 
6.3.

The R263K mutation in combination with other secondary mutations described above is associated with a 
significant fold change but also reduced viral fitness. Similar findings have previously been described also in 
treatment experienced, but INI naïve, adult subjects in the SAILING study.  
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The P1093 study is of single-arm open design, intended for ART-experienced but INI-naïve pediatric subjects. 
The MAH has confirmed that only ART experienced patients were included in the study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, dolutegravir is known to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication with well-established clinical efficacy 
in adult subjects. This application concerns children aged 6-12 years (Cohort IIA), where the clinical efficacy 
data is based on 24-week data from 22/23 study subjects and to some extent can be supported by 48-week data 
from subjects aged 12-18 years. 
The virologic response in Cohort IIA at 24 weeks is numerically inferior to what is seen in comparable adult 
subjects, but the low number of subjects and the greater uncertainty on treatment compliance in lower age 
groups makes a direct comparison impossible. Rather, the clinical efficacy should be inferred from PK/PD-data 
to ensure that the dolutegravir exposure in terms of AUC24 and C24 are comparable to what is seen in adult 
subjects. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In line with EMA guidelines, the P1093 study has not been dimensioned to establish direct clinical efficacy in the 
age group 6-12 years. As the pharmacologic target is of viral origin, there is little doubt that dolutegravir will be 
efficient in inhibiting HIV-1 replication also in this subset of patients as long as drug exposure is comparable to 
what is seen in adults. 
In contrast to adult patients, where a doubling of the dose to 50 mg x 2 is recommended, there is insufficient 
data to recommend a dose for dolutegravir in children and adolescents in the presence of INI resistance. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety data presented in this section support the primary objective of determining the safety and tolerability 
of DTG through Week 48 for Cohort I and Week 24 for Cohort IIA. 
The data cut-off for this analysis is 14 February 2015; the primary population for the safety analyses is the AT 
Population. Dolutegravir use was not associated with any safety events during the dose-finding period for either 
Cohort I or Cohort IIA (Stage I) that led to withdrawal or modification of any dose. 
Patient exposure 
As of the 15 January 2016 analysis cut-off date, a total of 46 subjects were exposed to at least one dose of DTG. 
In Cohort I, the median extent of exposure to DTG was 1198 days, ranging from 280 to 1387 days. In Cohort 
IIA, the median extent of exposure to DTG was 842 days, ranging from 84 to 1377 days.

Table 25.  Clinical Trial Exposure by Duration and Cohort All Treated Population – Cut-off 15 January 2016 
#Per target dose of ~1 mg/kg and weight bands, 19 subjects received 50mg/day and 4 subjects received 35mg/day. 
##Per target dose of ~1 mg/kg and weight bands, 1 subject received 70mg/day, 5 subjects received 50mg/day, 6 subjects received 35mg/day, 8 subjects 
received 25mg/day, and 3 subjects received 20mg/day.  
Adverse events 
The primary population for the safety analyses is the all-treated (AT) Population. The MAH also stated that the 
primary safety analysis includes only subjects whose starting doses have been those judged to be optimal for 
their groups, as stage I subjects whose doses have been adjusted for inadequate PK are excluded. However, the 
MAH has confirmed that all subjects that have received at least one dose of dolutegravir have been included in 
the safety data set. 
Stage I subjects who have been removed from treatment due to toxicities while on the optimal dose will be 
included and treated as safety failures in the primary safety analysis. 
The MAH states that DAIDS collects SAEs (which meet ICH criteria) through what has been submitted to the 
DAIDS Regulatory group while all other events are reported and collected via the Data Management Center from 
the clinical database. Therefore, SAEs reported may not show up in the AE database. For example, the suicide 
attempt below was not reported in the Diagnoses CRF but was reported as a secondary event in the Event 
Evaluation Form with Depression as the primary diagnosis. Only primary events from the Event Evaluation Form 
are summarized in the reports. 
The MAH has confirmed that there are no further SAEs that have been recorded as secondary events to a 
primary SAE diagnosis and therefore concludes that SAEs have not been underestimated in the study report or 
tabulated summaries.

Table 27.  Adverse events in Cohort IIA  - ages ≥6 to <12 years of age 
The MAH has also provided an updated summary of clinical adverse events as of Jan 15, 2016. As expected, the 
cumulative frequencies of adverse events rise with increased total exposure within the study but the overall 
profile is consistent with the tabulated summaries above.  
The new Grade 3 AEs reported were: pelvic inflammatory disease, sinusitis bacterial, vaginal discharge and 
nasal congestion in Cohort I; stomatitis necrotising, abscess limb and pain in extremity in Cohort IIa. All these 
new AEs were reported only once. No safety signal may be highlighted. 
The new Grade 4 AEs reported were intentional overdose and suicide attempt in both cohorts. All these new AEs 
were reported only once, without additional cases of depression. It is likely that these cases of suicide attempt 
were those previously reported as Grade 4 depression in the previous report. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
For DTG, AESIs have been identified based on non-clinical and/or clinical safety data for (e.g., GI disorders, 
renal disorders, hepatobiliary disorders), labelling and/or regulatory authority interest for INIs and/or the INI 
class (e.g., psychiatric disorders, rhabdomyolysis and myositis, serious rash and/or hypersensitivity), increased 
incidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS); and/or regulatory requirements.

Across Cohort I and Cohort IIA, 7 subjects reported one or more AEs from the Psychiatric Disorders SOC. 
Four subjects (3 in Cohort I and 1 in Cohort IIA) experienced depression or major depression. Three of these 
four subjects had a medical history of depression or other relevant risk factors. One subject also reported a 
Grade 4 suicide attempt. The suicide attempt was not considered related to study drug by the investigator and 
DTG was continued uninterrupted. Another also developed aggression while on study. This subject had a history 
of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and defiant and destructive behaviours since a young age.  
One Cohort I subject with a history of behavioural problems, difficulty concentrating, and learning disabilities 
was diagnosed with ADHD. Of the final two subjects, one was reported to have flat affect and the other reported 
difficulty sleeping. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders 
In Cohort I and Cohort IIA, AEs were commonly reported from the GI disorders SOC, with abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting being the most commonly reported AEs. Most GI adverse events were Grade 1 
or Grade 2. The commonly reported GI events are consistent with those observed in adult subjects receiving 
DTG. One subject experienced Grade 3 gastritis and abdominal pain, which was considered not related to study 
drug by the investigator. No change was made to the study drug and the subject was reported as recovered. 
There were no events indicative of GI erosion or ulceration. One subject experienced Grade 2 gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD), abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. This event was not considered by the investigator to be 
related to the study drug. 
Musculoskeletal Disorders 
In Cohort I and Cohort IIA, no Grade 3 or Grade 4 events from the Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissues 
Disorders SOC were reported. The most commonly reported Grade 1 and Grade 2 events were pain in extremity, 
muscular pain (e.g., back pain, musculoskeletal pain, and myalgia), and joint pain. There were no cases of 
rhabdomyolysis reported, and there was only 1 report of creatine phosphokinase elevation (Grade 1). 
Renal Disorders 
Renal laboratory data and relevant clinical event data are discussed under laboratory findings. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths reported in Cohort I or Cohort IIA. 
In Cohort I, 5 subjects (22%) reported at least one SAE: 
- 
- 
One subject developed a Grade 3 deep vein thrombosis. 
One subject developed herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and deep vein thrombosis (all Grade 2), and 
lymphadenopathy (Grade 3).

One subject reported a Grade 4 suicide attempt. 
One subject developed Grade 3 pelvic inflammatory disease. 
One subject developed Grade 3 gastritis. 
In Cohort IIA, 3 subjects (13%) reported at least one SAE: 
- 
- 
- 
One subject developed Grade 3 aggression and abnormal behaviour. 
One subject developed Grade 1 respiratory distress. 
One subject developed Grade 3 pneumonia. 
The intensity of most SAEs in Cohort I and IIA was considered Grade 3 by reporting investigators. None of the 
SAEs resulted in permanent discontinuation from IP and withdrawal from the study. None of the SAEs were 
deemed related to study drug by the investigators. 
With a limited number of study subjects and without a comparator, it is not possible to directly ascertain whether 
the serious adverse events reported from Cohort IIA are caused by dolutegravir treatment. Most subjects either 
had pre-existing conditions, belonged to a group with increased baseline risk regarding the events described or 
that the event was of a nature where a causal link to dolutegravir treatment is unlikely. Depression and suicidal 
ideation are currently listed in the Tivicay SmPC. Regarding the two cases of deep vein thrombosis in Cohort I, 
one had been casted and immobilised post orthopaedic surgery and the other presented with large-B-cell 
lymphoma in the groin on the same side. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry analyses were carried out on the AT population and were not carried out under fasted 
conditions. However, if triglycerides were Grade 2 (using DAIDS toxicity table for fasting triglycerides), a 
complete fasting lipid profile (triglycerides, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein [HDL], and low density 
lipoprotein [LDL]) was to be drawn. 
Laboratory events were reported by 21 (91%) subjects in Cohort I and by 22 (96%) subjects in Cohort IIA. In 
Cohort I, two laboratory events, lipase increased and neutrophil count decreased were considered serious or 
clinically significant by the investigator. In Cohort IIA, no laboratory events were considered serious or clinically 
significant by the investigator. Three subjects (13%) in each cohort experienced a laboratory event that was of 
Grade 3 or higher intensity. None of the serious or Grade 3 or higher laboratory events in either cohort were 
considered related to study drug by the investigator.

In Cohort I, there were 2 subjects with a Grade 3 laboratory AE (blood bilirubin increased and lipase increased) 
and 1 subject with a Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory AE (white blood cell decreased and neutrophil count 
decreased). 
In Cohort IIA, there were 3 subjects with a Grade 3 laboratory AE (2 blood bilirubin increased and 1 neutrophil 
count decrease). There were no Grade 4 laboratory AEs in Cohort IIA 
Liver Chemistries/Hepatobiliary Adverse Events 
Small increases in mean total bilirubin were observed. Nine subjects had increases in blood bilirubin greater than 
or equal to Grade 1 (three Grade 1, three Grade 2, and three Grade 3). Eight out of the nine subjects were taking 
atazanavir, for which asymptomatic bilirubin elevations are a recognized/listed adverse reaction in the product 
labelling. One event of blood bilirubin increased was considered possibly related to DTG. The only AE reported 
from the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC was Grade 1 hepatomegaly in one subject. All liver enzymes and 
haematology values were normal for this subject so no underlying cause was suspected. 
Renal Findings 
In Cohort I and Cohort IIA, no cases of renal failure were reported. Two subjects experienced Grade 1 
proteinuria. One of these experienced Grade 1 proteinuria that was associated with haematuria. This subject 
had an elevated albumin/creatinine ratio of 265.5 µg/mg at Baseline, which had decreased to 87.2 µg/mg at 
Week 48. The subject is being followed in a renal clinic, but no underlying cause has so far been identified. The 
second subject experienced Grade 1 proteinuria, which was considered possibly related to DTG. This subject had 
a normal albumin/creatinine ratio of 2.3 µg/mg at Baseline and it remained normal at Week 24 (2.6 µg/mg). 
There was no result reported for this subject at Week 48.

The non-progressive increase in serum creatinine is well-described in adult patients and considered related to 
dolutegravir blocking the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT-2). 
Immunological events 
In Cohort I and Cohort IIA, there were no cases of hypersensitivity or IRIS reported. No Grade 3 or Grade 4 
rashes and no serious skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis 
(TEN), or erythema multiform were reported. There were two cases of stomatitis reported. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
From a clinical perspective, this application raises no new safety issues regarding interactions. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
There were no adverse events that resulted in discontinuation of study drug. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of dolutegravir is considered favourable in adult subjects, with comparable or superior 
tolerability compared to the active control agents used in pivotal studies. The spectrum and frequency of clinical 
adverse reactions in this small sample do not raise any new safety signals.  
Potential hepatotoxicity has previously been investigated in detail, as this was seen in primates exposed to high 
doses of dolutegravir, but has not been verified in clinical studies. The laboratory findings regarding bilirubin 
increase is likely often related to concomitant treatment with atazanavir. 
In the specific laboratory paediatric safety data set, there is an increased frequency of hypoglycaemia and low 
bicarbonate. After reviewing the response from the MAH on the aetiology and confounding factors of these 
observations it is concluded that they do not currently indicate a safety issue, but the MAH should ensure that 
bicarbonate levels are measured adequately in future cohorts of the P1093 study to exclude possible causes of 
pseudo hypobicarbonatemia and allow adequate monitoring of participants. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No new or paediatric-specific safety issues have emerged from this very small sample.

Pharmacovigilance plan 
No new or additional pharmacovigilance activity was requested within the procedure. 
Risk minimisation measures 
The risk minimisation measures remain the same. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable.  
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tivicay (dolutegravir) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal products authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
DTG has a well-documented effect in inhibiting HIV-1 replication in adult patients, is generally well-tolerated and 
offers a decreased risk of viral resistance development compared to other currently available INIs. As the 
pharmacologic target is of viral origin, there is little doubt that DTG will be also efficient in children aged 6-12 
years, providing that drug exposure and viral susceptibility is comparable to what is seen in adults. The data 
provide sufficient reassurance in this sense. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Relevant uncertainties regarding the beneficial effects of dolutegravir in treating children aged 6-12 years 
pertain to the PK/PD bridge necessary to infer efficacy from the pivotal studies in adult subjects. 
The composition of the 10 mg in SPRING-1 is different compared to the tablets used in the paediatric study 
ING112578. In addition the composition is not proportional to the 50 mg tablet. It also behaves differently 
compared to the 50 mg tablet in the in vitro dissolution assay. The number of paediatric subjects in the present 
clinical study receiving the 10 mg tablet where exposure data is available is notably low. The relative 
bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet versus the approved 50 mg tablet has not been determined in a dedicated 
study. A difference in relative bioavailability cannot be ruled out, although not identified in the modelling 
analysis. Should such a difference exist, it could confound the estimated drug disposition parameters even 
though the model fits the data.  
For this application, where the amount of PK data is notably limited it is crucial to use both rich and sparse PK 
data to draw conclusions. Further, the data needs to be viewed or analysed simultaneously to assess the 
influence of age/body weight and to manage the imbalance between age groups. The model takes rich PK data 
as well as sparse PK data into account and estimates both an average PK profile and the associated variability. 
As such, this is a post hoc analysis and there is an inherent uncertainty which cannot be avoided. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
In adults, dolutegravir has a favourable safety profile at the once daily dose, used as PK reference in this 
application, as well as with the dose of 50 mg b.i.d. used in patients with prior INI resistance. The clinically 
observed adverse events are in line with what has been previously described in adults, and are generally benign. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Due to the limited size of the sub-cohorts in the P1093 study and sparse post-marketing data available from 
children treated within the current paediatric indication (12-18 years), it cannot be formally excluded that there 
are age-specific unfavourable effects that have not been detected.

EMA/601663/20177

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Dolutegravir is an important part of the pharmacological armamentarium in the treatment of HIV-1 in adults and 
will likely become so also in children, provided that the dosing scheme ensures adequate exposure in children 
from 6 years of age. Due to the established safety profile, the negative consequences of potential PK 
overexposure versus the 50 mg tablet in adults are judged to be less important compared to potential under 
exposure. With too low exposure in terms of trough concentration, there is a concern of reduced efficacy and 
development of resistance relevant to all available drugs in the INI class, and also development of resistance to 
the co-treating agents. That said, it is also recognised that dolutegravir at the exposures seen with 50 mg in the 
adult population has a robust barrier to resistance and an impressive therapeutic margin. 
Benefit-risk balance 
This application relies on the pharmacokinetic bridge that would allow the inference of efficacy and safety data 
from pivotal adult studies. Due to the limited data, population modelling is needed for drawing conclusions about 
dolutegravir pharmacokinetics in children between 6 years and 12 years of age. 
The population model of dolutegravir PK in children is an interpretation of existing data. It relies on previous 
knowledge obtained in the adult population as well as basic principles of clinical pharmacokinetics, especially in 
children. The model is similar to the adult Population PK model for dolutegravir. In addition, the 70 kg reference 
values for oral clearance and volume of distribution are similar for the adult and paediatric model. 
The PK data are sparse, variable and heterogeneous in terms of age, body weight, doses and PK sampling but 
can nevertheless be described by the model. The population PK model is considered qualified for its purpose and 
the proposed dosing appears adequate although there is an added level of uncertainty regarding the relative 
bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet. This is considered acceptable in this particular case, given the wide 
therapeutic window of dolutegravir. 
To improve the precision in modelling for the remaining parts of the P1093 study, the MAH committed to perform 
a relative bioavailability study to compare the 10 mg and the dispersible dolutegravir tablet formulations, to the 
50 mg tablet. 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall Benefit/Risk balance of Tivicay in children aged ≥6 to <12 years is positive.  
4.  Recommendations

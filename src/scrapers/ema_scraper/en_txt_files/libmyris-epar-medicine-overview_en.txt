Libmyris (adalimumab) 
An overview of Libmyris and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is Libmyris and what is it used for? 
Libmyris is a medicine that acts on the immune system (the body’s natural defences) and is used to 
treat the following conditions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
plaque psoriasis (a disease causing red, scaly patches on the skin); 
psoriatic arthritis (a disease causing red, scaly patches on the skin with inflammation of the joints); 
rheumatoid arthritis (a disease causing inflammation of the joints); 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis (both rare diseases causing 
inflammation in the joints); 
axial spondyloarthritis (inflammation of the spine causing back pain), including ankylosing 
spondylitis and when there are clear signs of inflammation but X-ray does not show disease; 
•  Crohn’s disease (a disease causing inflammation of the gut); 
•  ulcerative colitis (a disease causing inflammation and ulcers in the lining of the gut); 
•  hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa), a chronic skin disease that causes lumps, abscesses 
(collections of pus) and scarring on the skin; 
•  non-infectious uveitis (inflammation of the layer beneath the white of the eyeball). 
Libmyris is mostly used in adults when their condition is severe, moderately severe or getting worse, 
or when patients cannot use other treatments. For more information on the use of Libmyris in all 
conditions, including when it can be used in children, see the package leaflet or contact your doctor or 
pharmacist. 
Libmyris is a ‘biosimilar medicine’. This means that Libmyris is highly similar to another biological 
medicine (the ‘reference medicine’) that is already authorised in the EU. The reference medicine for 
Libmyris is Humira. For more information on biosimilar medicines, see here. 
Libmyris contains the active substance adalimumab.

How is Libmyris used? 
Libmyris is available for injection under the skin in a pre-filled syringe or pen and is usually given every 
2 weeks. The dose and frequency of injection depend on the condition to be treated and the dose for a 
child is usually calculated according to the child’s weight; because Libmyris is only available in doses of 
40 or 80 mg, it is not suitable for children who need less than a 40-mg dose. After training, patients or 
their carers may inject Libmyris if their doctor considers it appropriate. 
Libmyris can only be obtained with a prescription and treatment must be started and supervised by a 
doctor who has experience in the treatment of the diseases for which Libmyris is used. Eye specialists 
treating uveitis should also take advice from doctors who have experience of using adalimumab. 
For more information about using Libmyris, see the package leaflet or contact your doctor or 
pharmacist. 
How does Libmyris work? 
The active substance in Libymrys, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that has 
been designed to recognise and attach to a substance in the body called tumour necrosis factor (TNF). 
TNF is involved in causing inflammation and is found at high levels in patients with the diseases that 
Libmyris is used to treat. By attaching to TNF, adalimumab blocks its activity, thereby reducing 
inflammation and other symptoms of the diseases. 
What benefits of Libmyris have been shown in studies? 
Laboratory studies comparing Libmyris with Humira have shown that the active substance in Libmyris 
is highly similar to that in Humira in terms of structure, purity and biological activity. Studies have also 
shown that giving Libmyris produces similar levels of the active substance in the body to giving 
Humira. 
In addition, a study involving 412 adult patients with plaque psoriasis has shown that Libmyris was as 
effective as Humira in controlling the disease; average scores measuring the extent and severity of the 
condition improved by 91% after 16 weeks of treatment with either medicine. 
Because Libmyris is a biosimilar medicine, the studies on effectiveness and safety of adalimumab 
carried out with Humira do not all need to be repeated for Libmyris. 
What are the risks associated with Libmyris? 
The safety of Libmyris has been evaluated, and on the basis of all the studies carried out the side 
effects of the medicine are considered to be comparable to those of the reference medicine Humira. 
The most common side effects with adalimumab (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are 
infections (including in the nose, throat and sinuses), injection site reactions (redness, itching, 
bleeding, pain or swelling), headache and muscle and bone pain. Like other medicines of its class, 
Libmyris may affect the ability of the immune system to fight off infections and cancer, and there have 
been some cases of serious infections and blood cancers in patients using adalimumab. 
Other rare serious side effects of adalimumab (which may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) include 
failure of bone marrow to produce blood cells, disorder of the nerves, lupus and lupus-like conditions 
(where the immune system attacks the patient’s own tissues, causing inflammation and organ 
damage), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (life-threatening reaction with flu-like symptoms and painful 
rash affecting the skin, mouth, eyes and genitals).

Libmyris must not be used in patients with active tuberculosis or other severe infections, or in patients 
with moderate to severe heart failure (an inability of the heart to pump enough blood around the 
body).    
For the full list of side effects and restrictions with Libmyris, see the package leaflet. 
Why is Libmyris authorised in the EU? 
The European Medicines Agency decided that, in accordance with EU requirements for biosimilar 
medicines, Libmyris has a highly similar structure, purity and biological activity to Humira and is 
distributed in the body in the same way. In addition, studies in adults with plaque psoriasis have 
shown that the safety and effectiveness of Libmyris is equivalent to that of Humira in this group. 
All these data were considered sufficient to conclude that Libmyris will behave in the same way as 
Humira in terms of effectiveness and safety in its authorised uses. Therefore, the Agency’s view was 
that, as for Humira, the benefits of Libmyris outweigh the identified risks and it can be authorised for 
use in the EU. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
Libmyris? 
Patients treated with Libmyris must be given a reminder card with information on the safety of the 
medicine. 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of Libmyris have also been included in the summary of product characteristics and 
the package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of Libmyris are continuously monitored. Suspected side effects 
reported with Libmyris are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect patients.
